{"text":"I forgot to post my review from this summer. I had been there many time so I was happy to recommend it for my friend's b-day. I must admit the food was very good. But that night,  Worst service I have ever had. We were 7 people and somehow they forgot to put in our order for 1h30, We didn't manage to even get guacamole and tortillas on the table until 10pm (we arrived at 8h30pm) and that was after inquiring about our order 4 times to different bus boys and waiters. We had to constantly request more than twice everything, be it a drink, water or additional tortillas or until I finally got up to get it myself. It was aggravating. The only comp we got was shots that we didn't order... and I mean shots on an empty stomach is not really smart. I like this place, but i wouldn't recommend going as a group. I don't think they can handle it."}
{"text":"Hidden gem downtown! Great ambiance and kind staff.  Everything was delicious.  My least favorite was the churros.  Mango salad is a must try.  The fish tacos were AMAZING! Portions are small, but they are great for sharing! I already know what I will have when I go back!!!  It is a must try and probably best to reserve.  It was packed."}
{"text":"good tacos, good drinks. a nice place to have a 5 à 7 or evening out with friends."}
{"text":"great mexican joint downtown Montreal. very nice digs, always super busy tho, call and reserve as much in advance as you possibly can. drinks are a bit overpriced, especially the 11$ margarita... if they made it 8 bucks we would all have 2 or 3 as opposed to just one... ;) 
tacos are delicious, especially the Baja!"}
{"text":"The best tacos of my life. I'm vegetarian so I don't get to get excited about much outside of my own kitchen... And this was so good I was sad when I ate it all. The bartenders were nice and the miss Paloma drink was awesome. The decor is incredible and the vibe is friendly. The tacos come out quick. Yes you're in Quebec... But for God's sake you should eat this Mexican food."}
{"text":"We were in Montreal for two nights and we ate here both of them. The tacos are that good! The guacamole and chips are good to start, the truffle quesadilla is super flavorful. As for the tacos, the steak was hands down the best - a must order. The shrimp and mole tacos were also great. The fish tacos were overly battered, so it was a lot of fry, which made it not worth it. 

Make a reservation or be prepared to wait a bit on the weekends. 

The service was efficient, but not so friendly. The hostess seemed bothered that we wanted to wait for a table when we arrived and it was all booked up. It doesn't matter - the food is so worth it."}
{"text":"Amazing food, get a few orders of tacos and the pitcher. Make reservations. Server Yona was very attentive. Good vibe here, spinning records, clean. Yum"}
{"text":"Was there last night for there opening , great food & cocktails, this place will be one of the best Mexican restaurants in Montreal, its situated next to the quartier des spectacles so if your going to see a show its a great place to go before, my favorites the smoke meat taco,the quesadilla ,the baja taco(fish) ,the ensalada de mangos was super fresh and for the drinks the Michelada ,this drink has clamato which im not a big fan but its delicious!! 

Will absolutely be back!!!"}
{"text":"I am rating 5 stars to el habanero cuban restaurant next door (same owner) for the customer service and the fresh food. Had the pleasure to have their aguacate salada ( aguacate, papaya with an amaizing dressing made with mint, agave, cucumber and rum). The cubano maim dish a sandwith was very satisfying with the mix with the salad and rice. By the way best mojitos in town. Surely will be back on my next business trip."}
{"text":"I came here while traveling for business on short notice. Their door doesn't open from outside. I pulled and pushed on it like an idiot for a few minutes until another 2 people attempted to enter and confirmed my frustration. The host then came out to let us in. I was simply told that the restaurant is fully booked. No wait or anything... just no seats available for the rest of the night. What sort of restaurant doesn't save room for walk ins on a Wednesday night? If it was the weekend I guess it would be somewhat understandable. Lame..."}
{"text":"Apparently you *have* to make reservations, which was never apparent the three times my fiancée and I walked past this building. Mind you we tried going in on a Wednesday night. I suppose it's their choice not to want full seats.

On top of that, and at the risk of sounding super entitled and complain-y, I'm from California and making reservations for a restaurant that serves \"authentic Mexican street food\" is a complete joke."}
{"text":"I got the chips/guac, al pastor tacos, and their version of the Mojito.

Pros:
- I'm super picky about guacamole (i.e. I always order it and hardly ever like it) but I did really like theirs. I liked that their chips weren't standard corn chips but looked fresh fried and had some flavor on them.
- Tacos were really delicious - wouldn't change a thing about them. Tortillas tasted homemade (if they aren't, I wanna know what brand they use!)
- Drink was good although it could have been sweeter. I liked the little candied pineapple chunks that were in it. 
- Nice atmosphere. 

Cons:
- Staff could have been more attentive (took awhile to order) but food came out ridiculously quick. Everyone seemed to be running around. 

I LOVE mexican food and this place has superb tacos. If I lived in Montreal, I would probably come here once a week. Unfortunately, I was just visiting. Also, I went on a Tuesday night and it was quite busy."}
{"text":"Stopped in last week for some great tacos and drinks with my wife and my sister and brother in law. We had (they had other styles of tacos) the fish tacos 2 very tasty portions that had a perfect piece of crunchy cod in them. The  mojito with jalapeño peppers was very good and the best were Escodite's chiros mmmmmm good."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is Delish, the vibe is casual and fun, the drinks are on point.ive tried everything on the menu and was blown away. It's perfect for a fun and casual night with friends, they have a god selection of tequilas too! Love the decor, the music and the staff is friendly too. Difficult to get reservations. Reasonably priced . Order the nachos 2.0 you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Tasty food but after you've tried tacos at El Camino in Ottawa, it's very hard to find ones that top those. The place is nice though, a bit hard to get in without a reservation. Try the dumplings and the fish tacos! Oh and the cornbread is amazing!!! Just needs more of that little spiced butter on the side."}
{"text":"I was honestly very disappointed with my meal. It started off great, we started with guacamole to share and it was delicious. However the tacos we ordered to share were a let down. I ordered the Baja (fish) tacos and the pollos hermanos (fried chicken) tacos. The fish tacos were so fried that they were overwhelming, they didn't taste like tacos at all just like fried batter. The chicken in the chicken tacos was very grey, fatty meat, not good quality by any means and not the quality I would have expected from such an upscale place. My boyfriend ordered the smoke meat tacos, which he liked but didn't think they were anything to rave about, and the Don Puerco (pork) tacos which were pretty bland. We're both students and were looking to treat ourselves to a nice meal and we left feeling pretty dissatisfied. However I do have to say that their service is great, very attentive servers, too bad the meal left something to be desired."}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican-style tapas I've ever had, and exceptional service. Our bartender, V, was outstanding. It is clear that everyone who works here enjoys being here, and views their job as an art form. Our food came out quickly and far exceeded our expectations. My fiancé and I initially came here because we had a craving for guacamole, and it was some of the best guac ever. The chips are homemade and you can tell. We ordered the shrimp ceviche, which was so fresh, with crisp cucumber, tangy red onion, chilies, and crunchy plantains. Truly memorable. Then we shared the mushroom and truffle quesadilla, which was fantastic. I'll probably dream about it. Highly recommend this place for both spectacular food and beautifully made cocktails, as well as top notch service, at a great price point. The decor and atmosphere is super cool too!"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos, great atmosphere. Food is all around very good. The fish tacos are amazing though and it's always a struggle for me not to just order those. Absolutely recommend this spot."}
{"text":"The decor is to die for, the staff is friendly and helpful, and the modern twist if Mexican street food takes the cake. Drinks were fresh and delicious too. Highly highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Such a great place! Fun vibe, delish food, excellent service. Maria was our server and all her recommendations were on point. Guacamole, mango salad, jicama salad, quesadilla, shrimp ceviche and the tacos! Baja, steak, cod and pollo. So good! Oh and the margaritas, yum!"}
{"text":"Excellent resto! La bouffe est extraordinaire, mexicain avec de vraies épices et des choix originaux. Carte pas très longue mais tout ce qu'on a essayé était bon. Belle ambiance aussi et la déco est originale."}
{"text":"Great food. The guacamole is not to be missed. 
Was disappointed with the shrimp ceviche but the tacos more than made up for it. Favourite was the Pollo Hermanos followed by the lengua. 
Service was great. Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Had a great time at Escondite. My friend and I had not reserved, but we were lucky to get a place at the counter as soon as the place opened at 5:30 on a Saturday. The restaurant filled up quickly.

Beautiful interiors, very good service. My friend and I shared the corn bread, mango salad, baja tacos, la torta tacos (sp?). We had hibiscus yuze for drinks, and shared churros for dessert. It all came up to $23 each before tip. Not bad at all. Baja tacos were the best part. Definitely coming back for those."}
{"text":"Very mediocre food. Guacamole lacks pop. And is very one dimensional. Tortilla chips are much too oily and chewy. The pork ribs were pretty good mostly but some pieces were dry. The beet ceviche was extremely unimpressive. The chicken and fish tacos were too oily, lacked pop and very much meh. I will not be returning and would not recommend this restaurant although the service was good and the decor interesting. Quite loud as well."}
{"text":"It's quite simple: best \"rapport qualité prix\" by a mile. Best bang for your buck, best food , highest quality ingredients. There is no way you will dislike this place. The only downside is that it's so damn busy but that's only because it's beyond incredible.

If I was stuck on an island and I had to bring only one thing with me it would be : Escondite"}
{"text":"This restaurant was highly recommended by everyone I know and I was so excited to try it! I'm so sad at how disappointing the experience was. My first attempt to eat here I was turned away because they do not save any tables for walkins! You have to make a reservation or else you will not be seated. The next week once we finally got a reservation we arrived to find that the tacos seemed expensive - 9$ for two tacos (11$ for 2 steak tacos). We were happy to pay if they were good quality. Unfortunately the baja fish taco (fried cod) was super bland and mushy - not crispy as promised. The al pastor tacos were much better but very greasy. Overall, paying 25$ for 4 tacos is extremely steep if they are not amazing. They are also not allergy friendly! Wanted to sub crema for a no -dairy option. Not permitted unless you pay extra. 

A note about the service, we felt a bit as though the waiter was trying to coerce us into buying little extra sides like salsas. He mentioned it more than once even though we had already declined. We also waited almost half an hour after we had asked to get our bills - while we could see the waiter taking shots with a large party next to us. Kind of weird???

The two stars are all for the tasty al pastor tacos - but this place is way too overhyped."}
{"text":"We came here as a group of 20 on a Wednesday afternoon. I was pleasantly surprised that they were able to accommodate so many of us but not only that, very swiftly as well.The service was awesome, even as such a large group the waiter was on top of all the orders and consistently checked up on us. Plenty of choices on both the drinks and food menu. 

   I ordered a mohito, and shared a few tapas among my coworkers. The drinks were alright but to me, the standout of the night was definitely the food choices. The tacos were out of this world. We tried the guacamole, fish tacos, smoked meat tacos, beef tongue tacos, fried chicken tacos and the pork belly tacos. They also have a vegetarian option for all those vegetarians out there. 

  My favorite was definitely the pork belly taco, which was probably the best taco I've had in montreal. My coworkers also raved around the beef tongue and fried chicken tacos, which at that point I didn't have the room for. Great housemade guacamole as well ! 
  
  The price point is really reasonable, with the tapas ranging from $6-14 and $7 for 2 decent sized tacos. I'd definitely recommend if you're downtown and looking for a great 5 a 7 place to grab a bite."}
{"text":"Pros: 
- authentic tacos with a large variety including fish and shrimp tacos. 
- very tasty 
- only has tacos and a few appetizers which were delicious

Cons: 
- expensive for the food.  Tacos are 2 for $8, adding $1-2 for extras. 
- extra Pico and red salsa is a $1 each
- beers are ridiculously overpriced.  $8 for Dos Equis.  
- dinner for two including Guac and a few beers was over $80.   For tacos.  

Overall, the place charges champagne prices for a beer budget food."}
{"text":"This place gets the okay from this little Mexican girl. It's not authentic because the menu plays around with the traditional dishes but I do respect that the cook comes up with some great ideas. I've enjoyed practically every meal I've eaten here but don't come here thinking you'll be getting the real deal. Though I wouldn't consider it Tex-Mex, I'd call it Mexican Fusion food."}
{"text":"Some middle of the road tacos and salads inspired by Californian style Mexican food. Don't go there expecting tradition and you won't be disappointed. You might think something as simple as a churro could not be missed, but they were an total letdown. The staff will always try to make your order more than you actually need, just be careful not to fall for each and every one of their \"suggestions\" and you'll have a good time."}
{"text":"This place is hands down the best Mexican restaurant I've even eaten at. The price / quality ratio is unmatched. Unreal."}
{"text":"Great vibe, great service and the flavours were amazing. The top pick are the Baja tacos. So good. The shredded beets on the top were a concern but I dove in and was not disappointed. The combination was outstanding. Next up was the steak taco. Oh wow! I have never tasted such an amazing combo of steak, sesame, Korean hot sauce in one scrumptious bite. What a flavour sensation. 
The four stars are due to the beverage.  The margarita was a slight disappointment for it should have been presented without the rocks as a shaken margarita should, the flavour wasn't bad and they did not short you on the tequila for it was present when you took your first sip. 
Our server was super pleasant. Gave us good recommendations and was prompt, courteous and helpful. I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Merci patronnn merci patronnn ! J'ai découvert cet endroit via un business lunch avec quelques supérieurs donc il fallait bien les remercier ! (surtout que du coup je n'ai pas payé, donc c'était encore meilleur)

Pour faire bref car tout a été dit déjà : ambiance et dépaysement express garanti. (Jusqu'au détail de la pompe à bière en forme de cactus, megalike). Express car c'est assez efficace au niveau du service. C'est un peu cher, surtout pour les quantités, mais c'est frais et telllllemmmeeennnt bon !

J'y suis allé une seconde fois avec des collègues mais j'y retournerai sans doute ! Ole !"}
{"text":"Alright food, but don't get the drinks!!

Their tacos were pretty good \"fusioned\" taco.  Small and delicate/balanced, but super pricey and comes out slow.  It's lacking that mexican or at least that tex-mex flare though.  It's not terrible considering we're in Montreal.

The really bad thing was that a bartender was constantly putting bar spoon into his mouth between mixing drinks, then putting that spoon into the bucket of his other tools...  Maybe he's nasty but he does his job well?  Nope.  His drinks were failurs.  His measuring is garbage and I saw he pour the same amount of liquor for making 4 drinks as he did for making 2... It is no surprise, when we saw at least 3 drinks come back saying it's not strong enough and ours barely taste like it had alchohol, but... at that point we didn't really care any more and left. haha"}
{"text":"We were a group of 8 who came for birthday lunches this past Tuesday. This location is slightly bigger and fits groups in a few sections. Always love looking around at the decor throughout the restaurant. There is something always eye catching. 
Our main server was attentive and kind.

I ordered the mango salad which was very tasty and a good sized portion for one. I followed that by an order of the baja fish tacos which were satisfying. These dishes hit the spot and I did not feel overly full. 

The only reason for my 4 stars was that my colleague received 2x orders of his tacos as the server brought it to the wrong table. He was not compensated and paid for both. 

Despite the mix-up, my colleagues enjoyed their orders such as the general tao chicken, ribs, key lime dessert in a cup, and chicken tacos.

I'll be back and the next time I'll order alcohol."}
{"text":"That corn bread though. We were a group and had the menu \"dégustation\". It was worth every bite. Mango and corn salad were very good. Then came the black cherry ribs as well as the general chapo chicken. Both very tasty. We had 4 different choice of tacos (al pastor, steak, fried chicken) they were all good except the cod which wasn't a big hit. As for dessert we had the key lime pie which was lacking. Whipped cream not firm enough and the lime filling tasted like it was apple sauce based. Very grainy, not limey enough and you could taste the egg yolk. As for drinks, I had the Paloma which was ok. Service was very good."}
{"text":"Came in to try the taco scene in Montreal. I had some very well seasoned tofu tacos and my fiancé had a whole assortment of tacos. The tacos did not disappoint and my fiancé seemed impressed with the tasty tofu tacos. It's not something he would usually order but it was cool to see him try it. 
The vibe here was really chill. Little noisy, but great for a date over some tacos and drinks. The mojitos were muy bueno, highly recommend them."}
{"text":"Walked in on Saturday night without a reservation, they were able to accommodate us on a cute table for 2, but I would recommend reservations. 

Great dishes to share, everything I had was great, great taste, nice presentation, and delicious, from the quesadillas to the tacos to their churros. 

I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I had the cornbread, beet ceviche and cauliflower tacos, and everything was excellent.  The beet ceviche were in large pieces, which was surprising, but it was still good (the pumpkin seeds were a nice touch).  Tacos & cornbread were served piping hot.  Was there towards the end of the evening, and the food came out fast.  The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is it took awhile to get the check.  But the food was excellent."}
{"text":"Every single bite we had at Escondite was absolutely phenomenal. It's Mexican with a twist - usually I'm not a fan of twists on classics but in every case, it worked. We started with the Nachos 2.0 - no chips here! Your normal tortilla chip is replaced with the lightest and most delicious cheese and jalapeño goyza, topped with guac, more cheese, and pomegranate salsa. Never thought to pair pomegranate with Mexican but that's all I'll be doing from now on. 

Now on to tacos. I had the Pollos Hermanos - crispy fried chicken, chipotle crema, every so slightly sweet cornbread croutons and iceberg lettuce. I get it - that combo doesn't SOUND like it would work, but it ABSOLUTELY DOES. The cornbread balances out the chipotle and the iceberg compliments the heavier fried chicken perfectly. Boyfriend had the Don Puercos and he raved as well. 

And finally, the churros. I've had good churros and I've had horrible excuses for churros, but these were beyond perfect. Crispy on the outside but soft in the middle with a perfectly sugared crust - that's how you do a churro. They come with Nutella to dip which I thought I wouldn't like (there's that twist again) but it TOTALLY works. 

I honestly wish I lived in Montreal; I'd eat here all the time. Definitely make a reservation - we tried to get in on a Thursday but no dice, so we made a late reservation for Friday. So worth it."}
{"text":"Super disappointed in the management of this restaurant. Showed up with my family and friends for a big celebration dinner only to be told no children under 18 allowed. I am a frequent diner and know what good customer service looks like and this was not it. The hostess told me that she tried to reach me today to confirm. She recited the number she had and when I whipped out my phone to show her that she never called, so she told another lie that the website clearly indicates no one under 18. Fact checked again and another lie. So took my entourage of 9 and called in a favor at a better establishment. These guys won't get my business. Pissed off."}
{"text":"Very good! We ordered shrimp ceviche, guacamole which came with plantain chips I think, a cornbread muffin, and a variety of tacos and they were all great. The waiter was amazing and explained everything extremely clearly and gave us some great recommendations."}
{"text":"I always wanted to visit Escondite when all the hype would come down, well now it's done!

I went there on a Thursday evening around 6, the place was just starting to fill up. I sat down at my favorite spot, the bar. The barmen were very friendly and very professional. I ordered a signature cocktail, the Zorro, soooo tasty! I had this drink with fish tacos, a chicken tao and as dessert a strawberry Jarritos (ok it is not a dessert but that's what I wanted lol) ... In short, I loved everything! From the colors and decoration to the different flavors of each dish, I'm a fan and I will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"On l'a essayé le midi. Le menu est original et très abordable. La salade de mangue était très bonne. On a tous apprécié nos tacos et les côtes levées. Les ailes de poulet sont très bons également. 

La bière est chère (8-10$). Le verre de vin est 10$. Ils ont des verres de jus 4$. 

Le serveur était bien sympathique et le service était rapide."}
{"text":"GOOOOOD TACOS. But 3stars for portion + service + poor spice level. I had Steak Tacos, Mango Salad, Shredded Chicken Tacos. The tacos come in servings of 2 or 3 (extra charge) and also of the same kind. Tacos are extremely small. I had mango salad for appetizer, 2 tacos, was still hungry so had order another round of tacos. I'd recommend the steak tacos, more flavour, sort of sweet. Chicken tacos were all right but nothing special. Mango Salad was pretty fantastic I admit,sweet, sour, spicy. I didn't like the service. Waiter was in a hurry. We were a big group and he seemed overwhelmed by that. They also charged for salsa and the salsa was not even spicy (neither was the tabasco sauce). They didn't offer salsa in the beginning as well and we had to ask for it by the time we were almost done. Portions are not satisfying for the price. Also tried the churros, warm and delicious! Decor has obvious voyeuristic appeal for white crowd (cf: Frida Kahlo, Luchador mask, sugar skull etc)."}
{"text":"Where do I begin? Our waiter; a fun, informative, friendly guy that helped make our evening terrific! The atmosphere is funky and energetic with great tunes. And the food was absolutely amazing! The wings and quesadillas were the best I have ever had. Had to try the churros and glad we did, delicious. Do yourself a favour and have a shot of tequila, you won't be disappointed;) What a great eating experience in one of my favourite Canadian cities!"}
{"text":"Before coming here. Make sure you reserve as it doesnt have many places and it's always packed. All the tacos come in 2 per plate so it's easy to share with another friend. Theyre all delicious and very flavorful. The churros are also delicious. 

The service is fast and the staff is friendly and make good recommandations. 

It's prob my fave tacos place."}
{"text":"Wooow ! 

Le meilleure restaurant mexicain que j'ai essayé de ma vie ! Pour 25$ par personne vous pouvez manger comme des rois et essayer de nouveaux mets tous aussi délicieux les uns que les autres ! 

Vous devez essayer les nachos et le quessadilla au champignon !! 

Les cocktails sont un peu dispendieux mais ils sont fait à base de téquila majoritairement, alors cest normal ! 

Bref une experience formidable"}
{"text":"Roaming around Montreal looking for something different and fell into this place.  Great Mexican food in the heart of Montreal.  Tacos al Pastor, Baja Tacos, Tostadas de Tinga and Churros all worthy. The dining room/bar is tight but cozy. Wall art and ambiance a must see.  Service was good and the staff made great recommendations for other options in town.  Would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"The best tacos I've ever had (vegetarian), and quite possibly the best mojito as well, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to check this place out for awhile and finally found myself in the neighborhood and hungry enough to stop through. Luckily was able to be seated right away, though I imagine this place has a wait every so often. The decor is a little on the mexploitation tip highlighted by paintings and photos of Mexican lucha libre wrestlers. Our server welcomed us and gave us the newbie rundown, and after examining the menu, we were ready to go. Ordered the Mojito del'King: dark rum, pineapple syrup, jalapeño, pineapple, and mint. Delicious. Not to mention a piece of art. For our food we ordered the corn esquite (just okay) along with three different tacos: the al pastor (amazing, we ordered it twice), the baja (just okay), and the pollos hermanos (can't go wrong with fried chicken). Wasn't too thrilled about paying extra for the sauce (on top of the other expensive things), but we did it anyways. Overall I think this place is perfect for treating yourself and a loved one to a night out."}
{"text":"We tried to get a table in this restaurant (with no reservation) on at least 5 different occasions. Finally, we had the chance to grab a bite here. The staff was very nice and attentive. The cocktails were absolutely delicious. Good vegetarian options- we had the tofu tacos, and the mango salad- both absolutely delicious. These are by FAR the best veggie tacos we have had in Montreal. Cannot wait to come back!! Highly recommend for good ambiance, and mexican food!"}
{"text":"By far the BEST Mexican joint in the city.

Guacamole and chips are authentic and awesome
The Nachos are to die for....so Yummy...basically little nacho dumplings of love.
The Quesadilla is chessy and delicious

The fish tacos were crispy and very tasty
Lengua tacos were awesome probably my favorite

Pork Ribs are saucy and delicious didn't think about ordering them but glad I did 

Overall great experience Great Staff fun place...would definitely go back"}
{"text":"People who arrived 30 minutes after us received their meal before us. We ordered an appetizer as soon as we were seated and only received it after 35 minutes of waiting patiently. Server asked if we were done and we replied we are still waiting for our food and then she disappeared."}
{"text":"Relativement nouveau, situé dans le Quartier des spectacles. Une belle surprise.

Commençons par la boisson (oui, j'ai aussi mangé...). J'ai pris un Cartel de Santa préparé à base de Mezcal, Sirop de fleur d'hibiscus, jus de Lime et Soda. Sucré. Le goût de fleur d'hisbicus est subtil, juste assez pour relever le verre.

Côté bouffe maintenant.J'ai commencé par la salade de mangue avec Concombre, coriandre, arachides, echalotte croustillantes, vinaigrette au Chamoy (si ma mémoire ne me trompe pas). Bon, délicieux, rafraichissant en fait.

J'ai aussi pris un Ceciche de Remolachas fait avec Betterave, Pommes, Céleris, Echalottes marinées, Coriandre et Graines de tournesol. Le goût de betterave est subtil, ce qui est pour moi, un signe de réussite. J'ai toujours trouvé que la betterave enterrait n'importe quoi et prenait toujours toute la place comme goût, peu importe le plat.

Sinon, que dire...assez abordable et un excellent service."}
{"text":"Excellent meal!  One of the best Mexican cuisines I have ever had!  Excellent margaritas, delicious pork taco's, very authentic, very tasty!"}
{"text":"The look and atmosphere of the whole restaurant were amazing! The details, from the skulls behind the bars to the Star Wars themed Darth Vader and the clone troopers drawing on end. The really nailed it with the details. 

The food itself was quality as well, had the tofu taco and it was euphoric. Would definitely come again. Good for groups!"}
{"text":"Went there not long after it opened. Food was good and since we were 3 people we shared the food when possible. It was all good some better than other. Drinks were  good but strong on the alcohol. Decor is minimal but perfect for the restaurant."}
{"text":"Delicous mexican food at a very affordable price.  No wonder it was packed even on a Tuesday in January!  I tried the guacamole, fish, and steak tacos.  All were very good.  Thinking to return for more already!"}
{"text":"Location: On Union between Ste. Catherine and René-Lévesque. If you find parking on Union, you're lucky - it's construction central right now. You may luck on either street above/ below Union but that'll depend on your timing. Check the meters for restrictions. 

The place: I love it. It reminds me of a humble beach shack that you'd find in Mexico or California. Escondite boasts a super cozy, warm vibe without any pretense. Dimly lit, wood, cozy seating and great art scattered across the room. Admittedly, one of the reasons I wanted to check this place out is because local artist Miss Me painted a massive mural at the back of the room and I needed to snap it. It totally rocks - you should check it! We went on a Thursday night so it was a little loud but we had no issue with this. 

The goods: My fellow Yelper and I both ordered the Mojito del'King and HELLO, we weren't disappointed. It was awesome. The fresh mint was a great touch. On the menu:

Guacamole w/home-made tortillas: Very good. The guacamole could have used a bit more seasoning but this probably comes down to personal preference. The tortillas were crispy and light, but not oily.

Baja tacos (crispy cod, avocado crema, cabbage slaw): Great! The fish was flaky and perfectly cooked.

Ceviche de Camarones (plantain shrimp ceviche, cucumber, red onion, Serrano, oranges, plantain): Delicious! I think this was my favorite dish - it was light and fresh, and bursting with flavor. 

We also had a beet salad that I don't see on their online menu. It was pretty good. For dessert, we had Churros with Nutella - YUM!

Service: Because I procrastinated in writing this review, I forget our waiter's name. All I can say is that he was awesome. Super friendly, knowledgeable and willing to make suggestions. This guy knows what customer service is all about. 

Price point: With tip, it cost each of us about $44. While this is a tapas place, I found the portions to be pretty generous, and I'd say that if you were solo, you could easily get by on 1-2 tapas. Unless you're like, a Sumo wrestler. Then you might want to order more. 

All in all, a great spot in the downtown core."}
{"text":"Bien situé pour les gens qui travaillent dans le coin, que ce soit pour l'heure du lunch ou un 5@7
Bon choix de bouffe mexicaine, à prix raisonnable
La guacamole maison est vraiment bonne, accompagnée de chips maison en plus!
Les tacos sont très bons aussi! Nous étions 3, avions pris 3 choix différents et avons tous été satisfaits de nos tacos!
Attention, ils ne prennent pas de réservation pour moins de 6 personnes le midi
A essayer!"}
{"text":"This place deserves a review! It's so festive in here....in the sense of great decor, causal vibe, and the ability to let my imagination to take over.  I really felt like Nacho Libre would be jumping out asking me about his recreation clothes! :D

I came here when it has only been opened for 2 months.  Like any new resto, you gotta give it some time to iron things out... no major improvement is needed tho', just let the food speak for itself!

Affordable prices and perfect sizes that allows you to sample a lot of their menu items in one visit.  Everything is so tasty!  You cannot go wrong in getting the tacos...They're like 3-bite tacos.  My fav is the cauliflower one...yum....!  

Also got the fresh churros that comes with Nutella...If you like fried and chocolate, then this is the dessert for you.

I highly recommend this place to go to after work if working downtown.  I'd come here everyday if I could ;)."}
{"text":"If you want a table here, book well in advance! It's tough to find a table on any night that isn't a Monday. I got the guacamole and some of the vegetarian tacos and was thoroughly impressed. The decor is dim and romantic. I recommend it for a date or gathering of 3 or fewer people. Definitely not suitable for groups. As a Texan, I feel a bit more comfortable knowing that I can find a pretty fair taco in this cold, cold city."}
{"text":"Excellent plates to share. Tonnes of great options with ranging levels of spiciness. The place is small but good for a few friends.
Excellent food and cool cocktails"}
{"text":"Don't usually write reviews unless the experience is top notch, and that is the case with Escondite. My brother and I decided to try out this authentic Mexican taqueria in downtown Montreal based on other Yelp reviews. We didn't have reservations on a busy Saturday night, but  managed to sweet talk the hostess into letting us squeeze into the bar. A fortuitous move on our part since we ended up sitting next to one of the owners, Moti, who generously treated us to several shots of his best selections of tequila and mezcal as well as getting us on the list at the Fly Gin after dinner was over. 

After finding out I was from NYC, Moti told us Escondite is fashioned after La Esquina, the famed taco bar in Soho.

IMO Escondite's marinated al pastor tacos are second to none. The guac comes out quick and perfectly mashed coupled with homemade tortilla chips. The menu offers several vegetarian options I'll have to try next time I'm in town and I'm showing no hang over effects on a short night's rest :)

The \"barrio\" decor's focal point is a large hand painted mural on the back wall, but my favorite detail is the Darth Vader towel rack inside the bathroom with the tag, \"I'm your Papi.\" 

You won't be disappointed if you're into authentic Mexican food in a sexy, yet unassuming local."}
{"text":"Veggie/vegan options had astonishingly good flavor. The jicama salad was perfectly spicy and the  vegetarian/cauliflower tacos did not disappoint. The cauliflower wasn't overcooked and well retained all the spices of the dish."}
{"text":"Wish there was Escondite in NYC!! This place has great cocktails and some of the best tacos I've ever had! Even on a Friday night the service was on point. We sat at the bar and even though the bartenders were super busy they still made sure to attend to us. I highly recommend this restaurant! There is nothing I don't recommend. We wanted to order everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"This is the newer location of the original Escondite on Av Union. They take reservations so I would recommend making one. The space is relatively small and really nicely decorated in a recurring Frida Kahlo theme. The menu has a wide variety of small plates. There were four of us and our server recommended we order approximately 10 small plates to share. We ordered 8 and that was perfect.
I tried the Mojito del King cocktail-refreshing and tasty but I didn't find it to be spicy in spite of the jalapeño. 
Our small plate selection: shrimp ceviche, pork ribs, two orders of nachos (not with chips! More like little dumplings-yummy), mushroom quesadilla, steak, Baja & crispy chicken tacos. It was all very good.
Although we were quite full, I still wanted to finish the meal off with an order of the churros. They were nice and hot, served with a side of Nutella.
We will be back the next time we're in the area!"}
{"text":"I was devastated when I finally had the chance to go to Escondite, it was nothing to rave about. Everything is very basic or below average I may add. appetizers werent good (the popcorn dish was used with old popcorn making it chewy and so unpleasant to eat), guac was such a small portion for the price. The tacos are okay, literally nothing worth mentioning, fish wasn't crispy enough and super bland, beef was not that tender & I believe the tongue was meh) & dessert was meh, even their churros were dry and hard. 

The bathrooms are super cute and im sure the drinks are good but the food is not a reason why i would waste my night out at Escondite. I did want to love this place but would I be back? never. would I recommend. nope"}
{"text":"A lot of the time, for me, Mexican kind of exists at the same level. But at Escondite, it's definitely taken to the next level as artisanal and craft Mexican food! I would recommend this place for both couples and groups alike.

The food is delicious and prepared with fresh ingredients. Their plates are tapas/appetizer-style which means you'll order multiple plates and share (or perhaps keep one to yourself if you fall in love with it).

Service was fast and friendly. My only slight complaint is that, for the portion sizes, it is on the pricier side. But the flavors are well worth it."}
{"text":"I am from Toronto and my boyfriend and I have been wanting to eat here since last time we came to Montreal, however we were silly and didn't know we had to make reservations. Well this time we did, at 9pm and we're actually moved up to 8:30pm which was awesome! and I must say the food and service were PHENOMENAL! I wish I knew my waiters name but he was beyond great and helped us order all the favorites and we were very pleased.. My boyfriend LOVED the cod tacos and I devoured the steak tacos and the chicken tacos (personally, I was obsessed with the chicken tacos. But make no mistake that the steak was amazing too) we also had the mushroom quesadilla and it too was just too good for words!  We ended with the churros and fought for the last one, they tasted great with the nutella sauce given. The vibe here is so amazing and I am looking forward to coming back to Montreal again just so I can come back to Escondite! This place truly is a hidden gem! 

Make sure to make reservations though! They get crazy busy simply because there food is that good!!"}
{"text":"Bel endroit pour un 5 à 7 ou pour souper entre amis, .. une très bonne ambiance ! Service de bartending professionnel et créatif. J'ai testé la guacamole en entrée et par la suite, nous avons enchaîné avec les tacos de morue et ceux aux steak, qui étaient franchement excellents ! Toutefois, j'aimerais souligner que nous avons dû négocier un moment avec l'hôtesse pour avoir 2 places au bar. D'abord, le refus complet pour ensuite nous offrir deux place en retrait et pour finalement terminé au bar. Peut-être qu'il serait préférable pour les propriétaires du resto de revoir le \"seating plan\" question de ne pas perdre de revenus et d'accommoder les \"walk-in\" sans réservations? Surtout lorsque c'est possible.

Somme toute, une super découverte et un service hors pair assuré par Nabil et Mr V. Mes salutations et nous reviendrons."}
{"text":"Really great vegetarian choices. I got both vegetarian taco varieties, the corn, and chips/salsa. Everything was delicious! Interesting atmosphere and very popular; absolutely make reservations for dinner. I can't speak for lunch. 

The margarita wasn't my favorite as they put a spice blend, of sorts, on the side of the glass and I like a more-traditional salt rim. 

I would definitely return and would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"My friend picked this restaurant and made reservations beforehand for 8 pm because she had heard of how difficult it is to get a spot here last minute. Glad she did as it was completely packed when we got there even on a Wednesday night! 
This spot has a really cool and hip vibe!! 
We started with the famous drink, Zorro. It had a unique flavour and was definitely worth trying. 
We ordered two types of Tacos to share. 2 Fish Tacos and 2 Crispy Chicken Tacos. Both were very good, but I liked the fish ones more. 
The guacamole served with the chips was authentic and delicious. 
Service was slow because of how full the restaurant was but we didn't mind waiting as everything was perfect otherwise!! Would definitely recommend this spot for an authentic Mexican experience."}
{"text":"Don't come starving unless you plan to spend a lot. It's fresh and delicious but if you have a big appetite (I do) you'll need a lot to fill you up. That's tacos I guess...
Perfect for a cocktail and a snack. Service was great. Avoid the downtown chains and eat here."}
{"text":"We lived in Los Angeles for years, and only know of one place with a better taco al pastor. We also very much enjoyed the tostadas. This place is a gem in Montréal! 

Our server was kind and had great answers for us when we asked what other things besides the typical tourist attractions we should do while visiting the city. 

My only complaint is we were hoping to be able to get some cocktails from their menu at lunch, and they don't have a bartender on until the evening. Understandable, but a bummer while on vacation!"}
{"text":"Definitively a downtown place to go after work - the food is very great ! And the margaritas are very good shared with the girlfriends (a pichet obviously)

Take the fish taco, the nachos, quesedillas MIAM MIAM MIAM"}
{"text":"Hands down best Mexican restaurant in Montreal. Great,  fresh,  and impressive food! Need to go back."}
{"text":"Great meal - fish tacos were on point. Cool original vibe. Pretty good service. Overall highly recommend as best Mexican I've had in MTL."}
{"text":"I'd give them 5 stars, but they have a real inability to keep their alcohol stocked. It's always a game of \"ok... So what do you have?!?!\" Everything else is good. There's NO excuse for running out of booze."}
{"text":"Really good place with great vibes. The food was delicious, I tried few plates as recommended."}
{"text":"Restaurant mexicain sans prétention, ambiance festive, service attentionné, mets goûteux et excellent et bon rapport qualité prix."}
{"text":"Around 2-3 years ago I discovered this place, and felt it was a neat trendy place to be too enjoy tacos and drinks with friends. 

Back in town and had to come back, longing for the vibe and food and drinks and is as good as I remember it! Just a really neat place to hang out either at the tables or even the bar, everyone is so friendly. 

It's not a cheap taco place but they more than make up for it in quality. I'd be great regularly if I lived here!"}
{"text":"I do not like Mexican food so let's say I wasn't dying to go but my friends were raving about this place so I had to oblige. Now, it's definitely one of my favorites in Montreal. I had the tasting menu which was really a great value for the price! My only complaint is that it's hard to get a reservation so reserve early"}
{"text":"Great food, drink and service. Had the fish tacos, chicken tinga, jicama salad & beetroot ceviche. Would order everything again, except the beetroot (which was fine, but not amazing). Overall, super cozy and great experience."}
{"text":"Shared 4 orders of two tacos. More than enough for two hungry diners. Al Pasteur and Baja were oh so delicious."}
{"text":"Getting a reservation here is so hard, but you must beg the staff to let you peek into the restaurant if you can't eat here. The ambience is phenomenonal, the painting of the two ladies, the blue skull with flower eyes, the storm trooper & Darth Vader. It was all such a treat to the eyes, I absolutely love how they transformed the space (even the bathroom signs were quirky and fun). 

I used to be averse the idea of sitting at the bar during a date, but I must admit I had such an amazing time at Escondite. The bar tender was friendly and let us have our space, he also recommended their specials. I must mention, having previously bad Mexican food experiences, it was hard to convince me but this place made me change my opinion altogether. I loved their corn bread (I could have that all day everyday), the quesadilla was the best I have had in the city so far, the fried chicken taco was absolutely amazing. 

Yes, the food was brilliant and we kept eating and drinking cocktails because we wanted to taste it all and didn't want to wait 2 more weeks for reservations. I can't wait to take all my friends there as an excuse to try out the few dishes I missed. 

If you go there for the first time, get the 1) tacos, 2) jalepeno corn bread, 3) quesadilla and Miss Paloma cocktail. 

I highly recommend this place to everyone. Best Mexican I have had so far!"}
{"text":"Ate there twice this week, once for business and once for a birthday party.  The venue can accommodate any occasion that's for sure.  

Food was awesome, tried the corn salad, papaya salad and mango salad...all very good and original.  Guac is as fresh as can be and all the tacos are good.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Fabulous spot. Packed on a Tuesday for lunch, which is always great to see. Corn bread to start, followed by sharing of chicken wings, and three different tacos, all of which were amazing (pulled pork, fish, steak). Would go back in a heartbeat. Pedro gave us awesome service too."}
{"text":"The food was good but overpriced. There were lots of people and the atmosphere was great. The decor and design were nice.
Now.. the service... hard to explain, but the waiter's attitude was kind of aggressive and unwelcoming. 
He just stood there to interrupt our conversation to take order, kept emphasizing that the portions are very small and each person SHOULD order atleast 3 dishes so if you re a party of 4, ATLEAST 10 dishes... It's like we know what are tapas, and we can always order more if not enough. When it was time to pay, he just tells us no change allowed, decide right away if you want to pay separate or together and it was just weird how he didnt leave the credit card in the machine. He inserted it, inputs his amount but removed it, give you back the machine and credit card for you to input the tips and expects you to fast pass the creditcard yourself again and had this annoyed face all along. 
Overall, my evening went great but the service was far from impressive."}
{"text":"Terrible service and unwillingness to accommodate. Website will not take reservations for parties less than 5 but then ask you for a reservation when you show up and refuse to find space to seat you."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Montreal. It is always busy and all their dishes are yummy. 

Get reservations cause they are busy everyday. All the drinks are delicious. I got the mojito and a bunch of others they are all potent.

They have a $30 sampling menu which is totally worth it.

The ribs are some of the best I've every had. The tacos and quesadillas were yummy too. 

They give you 5 to 6 dishes in the sampling menu which is more than enough for people with a big appetitie. 

They have a interesting take on nachos. Which are actually dumplings with guac. And Mexican flavors.

Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"Great little place with a quaint little terrace for those hot days. The dishes are quite varied and creative. Each flavor has its place and contributes well to the overall dish.

It's a tapas place so expect smaller portions and a lot of variety. Eating well you can expect around 40-50$ per person and be satisfied (including drinks).

Would recommend this to anyone looking for some new tastes and a good atmosphere. 

Our waiter was the nicest guy and the staff was helpful as well.

Check it out."}
{"text":"Can't believe I'm leaving behind this gem of a restaurant in mtl for BC! 

I spent the whole day with a friend shopping and eating out and the entire day we've had nothing but terrible service. We came to Escondito and first off, the atmosphere was amazing, the bartender's cute af and the food was simply merveilleux. 

Secondly, our server Jacob was beyond amazing. He made us feel welcome by greeting us with a smile and a joke. He mixed professionalism with playfulness, just the best! Our orders were taken and the food/drinks were sent promptly. Working in the food industry myself, his energy was satisfyingly refreshing and pleasant. When I go back I'm 100% going to ask for him again.

I definitely recommend going here and having a drink or two with the sirloin tacos or the crispy cod tacos, you won't regret it!!!"}
{"text":"They have a tasting many of 5 courses and it was epic.
Cornbread was excellent
Their gyozas with melted white soft cheese inside really good.
Chicken and pulled pork tacos very tasty.
We challenged and asked for a spicy dish and the \"general chapo\" chicken didn't dissapoint.
Ended with awesome churros with chocolate."}
{"text":"Fish tacos are crispy, service is excellent. Tacos are American style with quality and awesome flavours, like the \"mole\". Also salads are awesome"}
{"text":"Great food and nice ambiance! Really nice twist to traditional Mexican food. The fish tacos and the pork ribs were amazing! This place is always consistent and never ceases to impress me. Recommended."}
{"text":"I've visited this venue located in Downtown Montréal a few times and recently had the chance to go back. The venue was crowded as ever on a Saturday night; really enjoyed the great vibe and casual atmosphere. 
We were seated near the window on an uneven table (which was noted and fixed by the waiter) and some creaky wooden chairs over an old rug, but the yummy sangria pitcher made us forget it all! Seeing that we were having trouble choosing our plates, the waiter asked if we'd prefer the tasting menu, which I had no idea they offered, and for 30$pp it was so worth it! We started with mango salad, Mexican style General Tao chicken, corn bread with spicy butter, then came bbq ribs, and three kinds of tacos: pulled pork, steak, and cod. I'm sure I'm forgetting a few from the lineup but I was literally in a food coma; there was so much food, we didn't even finish our tacos. Best part, everything was delicious! Flavourful salad, succulent ribs, and the tacos were also delicious, perfectly topped and generously filled.  There was obviously no room left for dessert although the churros sounded so tempting. Will definitely try them next time cause I'm sooo going back! Kudos to our waiter Gabriel for the great service."}
{"text":"Omg steak tacos

Not only were the the best tacos I've ever had...it's the best food I ever had. 

Although I may have not eaten for a while today...I can guarantee you won't be disappointed with this place. Pants down."}
{"text":"Three words: best damn nachos.

My wife and I were sat inside immediately on a packed Friday night. Our friendly server immediately got us water and explained the menu and drink specials they had (that weren't on the menu).

He immediately sold us on the Mezcal Mules which were phenomenal: multi-dimensional layers of smoke, citrus, spice, and sugar. We were blown away!

The small dinner plates are priced around 9$ - 12$ each. Our server recommended 2-3 per person, so we ended up getting the Nachos 2.0 and three taco plates.

Right before the nachos came he surprised us with free tequila shots since it was our honeymoon -- they were exceptionally smooth!

But nothing on this beautiful green Earth could compare to the nachos, which were loaded with fresh guac, pico de gallo, and authentic Oaxaca cheese. I know what you're thinking: \"That sounds like your typical nacho dish.\"

Wrong.

Each bite carried a combustion of flavors that made you close your eyes and slowly nor your head, \"Yes.\" 

The tacos are made in with ingredients from many different cuisines, like the Korean-inspired taco we got that had bulgogi and jalapeños on it.

We finished our experience with homemade churros served with Nutella and a subtle chipotle kick that did not disappoint.

Our final bill for the two of us came to $97 after the drinks, 4 dishes, dessert, and a 20% tip. Not cheap but so worth it."}
{"text":"I went to Escondite for dinner with my boyfriend and was pleasantly surprised.
I've been to biiru and wasn't impressed, and knowing that this restaurant was by the same owners, I was a little sceptical.
The food was amazing and the service even more. 
I would recommend the ribs, the quesadilla and the nachos 2.0!! Also, if you can, ask to be served by a waitress named Maria she was awesome and really made the experience special!
Also the decor is fantastic"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Mexican restaurant in Montreal! If you want to go on a Friday or Saturday night, make sure to call a few days in advance. It is a very busy restaurant. The tacos are amazing! You get 2 tacos for $8. The baja fish tacos and the fried chicken tacos are definitely my favorite. The guacamole is also very tasty and is around $6. I'm not a huge fan of the drinks but the food is to die for! Definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"Used to be good. Quality diminished over the years. The tacos were stale. Service was ok."}
{"text":"C'est tellement beau, tellement bon, sans prétention et le prix en vaut tellement la peine! Je vous suggère de faire confiance aux serveurs, ils savent les meilleurs plats et sauront vous conseiller pour que vous ayez une expérience optimale !! Nous avons mangé le quesadilla à la truffe et c'est l'un des meilleurs plats que j'ai goûté; c'est débile ! Les tacos sont tous super, mon pref reste celui de steak ! MIAM !! Nous y retournerons c'est certain !!"}
{"text":"Overall this is a nice place, friendly staff and above average food. Main issue is price to knock the stars down.
Tacos were tasty and we'll priced.
Guacamole and chips were nice but the chips needed salt. 
Quesadilla was really good, but for the portion, over priced.
Mojito was not made correctly as it missed crushed ice and sugar crystals. Tasted more like a cocktail. Plus I ordered an extra shot in it, which was 5CAD, while the drink was 8. Weird.
Churros were the ultimate winners. I traveled a lot and whenever in Spain or somewhere claiming to have good churros, they all can't live up to these. No grease and an interesting mix of cinnamon with pepper.

Nice patio, but lacks music like the cool I side. At least there are no reservations on the patio, so if you were like me, and looked for something last minute in a city that isn't yours, this place satisfies."}
{"text":"My friend and I were in Montreal this past weekend to visit another friend and we came upon this spot after seeing the reviews on Yelp.  We figured \"why not?\" and took a stroll over to see what this place was all about.

Very trendy with interesting decor.  Low lights, music in the background and a 20ish-40ish crowd.  We didn't have a reservation, so we ended up at the end of the bar :(
Wasn't ideal, but we were hungry! And the restaurant was filling up quickly.

After a perusal through their menu, we decided on what food we wanted to order...corn bread, baja and pollos hermanos tacos and their version of \"nachos\".

We placed our order with one of the bartenders and had to ask for a drink menu.  The wait time for the food was reasonable, however, we still hadn't placed our drink order.  When the waiter served our food, we had to ask him if we could order our drinks.

Our food was fresh and delicious.  Small portions.  The complimentary chips and guac dip were nice.  The \"nachos\" were actually dumplings with nacho type filling and toppings.  Delish, but not what we were expecting, especially since there were only 6 dumplings for $12.00!

What irked me was that we had finished our food and still hadn't received our drinks! Although we did have water and the refills came often, we were hoping to enjoy our meal with our drinks.  We finally flagged down a waiter/bartender to ask what happened to our drinks and they went to check on it.

Drinks were yummy, but strong.  Lots of alcohol (not that I'm complaining), but my friend didn't enjoy hers as much.  Took away from the overall flavour of the drink.

Overall,  nice place to meet up with friends and have some drinks and light snacks."}
{"text":"Came here for date night on a Friday and the place was packed! Despite this, we were seated within 5mins. 

We started off with their guacamole with tortilla chips, which was delicious and well seasoned unlike most places. Next, we got the their quesadilla which mainly had cheese, and the baja (fried cod) and pollos hermanos (fried chicken) tacos! The quesadilla was really good, however it tasted more like a grilled cheese which is a little pricey for what it is (15$). The tacos were simply delicious! The cod and the chicken were fried perfectly and paired very well with their toppings. Don't forget to also try their drinks because they are worth a try! 

While some of the tapas may be a little pricey for their size, their dishes are delicious, especially their tacos and drinks. I would recommend make reservations since this place is quite popular and usually packed!

---

The tacos were so good I had to come back a second time during the same week! This time I tried the Al Pastor (pork belly) and Camarones et chicharon (shrimp and chorizo) tacos along with their mango salad! Once again, their food did not disappoint! The mango salad was a great way to start my meal and the Mojito Del'King paired very well with the food. Definitely coming back here often!!"}
{"text":"Really cool mexican place. 

The food was even better then 2 years ago! We had the shrimp tacos, deep fried chicken tacos, the ribs and churros with nutella. 
Cocktails are good and original. I had the Mojito del'King and it was great!

Young trendy customers. Good ambiance.

Well located downtown close to \"The Bay\" and \"Birks\".

A perfect perfect place for a birthday dinner with a group."}
{"text":"Top notch -  Baja and AL Pastor tacos were excellent. 7$ for two is a joke. Both ensaladas were good as well.  Sat at bar quick to get food"}
{"text":"Escondite offers Mexican fusion cuisine. The food is overall delicious. The dishes are of tapas size and we ordered a lot of food to share. Nice salads, tasty guacomole, and a dish that resembles nachos with cheese the name of which I could not reproduce, but you should order. The tacos are definitely well balanced, the tacos del pastor are not the best I have had yet they were pretty good. The star of the night were the churros with nutella, we couldn't resist, but to order two servings and ate them all, finally feeling happy and inflated. Interesting cocktails, I definitely enjoyed my Mojito del'King and if you are a fan of tequilas or mezcals, you would enjoy sipping some good ones. The bill was split in some weird way between the five of us and I guess we were too full to put some thought in it, so check it well if you are big party. Escondite is really centrally located and gets busy quickly, reservation is recommended."}
{"text":"Went there for my friends birthday and had an amazing time. Lovely place, amazing food, good art and ambiance. They have very original tacos, lots of flavours and the churros at the end were to die for! Our server Javiera was lovely and very helpful, Ill be coming back for sure"}
{"text":"Busy spot, came towards the end of the lunch rush and got seats in 10 minutes. You have to try their chicken wings, yes, I said it. You will thank me, we ordered two rounds."}
{"text":"Probablement le meilleur rapport qualité-prix du centre-ville. Le service est hyper rapide, donc parfait pour un dîner au travail. Nous y sommes allés à huit et même les plus difficiles ont adoré. C'était ma deuxième fois, alors j'ai maintenant goûté à une bonne partie du moment et rien n'est décevant. Faites juste attention : le cornbread est petit. Seul hic, parce qu'il est SI bon."}
{"text":"Finally, an authentic Mexican restaurant that serves delicious food. I had so many bad experiences with Mexican restaurants here that I had given up on good Mexican food, until I tried this place. Definitely going back to this place. Loved everything about the place such as the ambiance, food (obviously), cocktails and their customer service. And yes, make reservations ahead of time."}
{"text":"Went there with a group of 12.
Food was ok to good. 
Guacamole and ribs were awesome!!!
Chicken wings were good.
The tacos and ceviche were ok.
Quesadilla was so so for 14$.
Starting waiter, forgot some of our orders.
Price was ok."}
{"text":"Really expensive for Mexican food but worth it. Menu was refined and really worked on, you can tell they really put in the time of day to combine the best possible ingredients to create delicious dishes full of flavour and texture. The Nachos are a MUST, they really interpreted it to make it their own (it's a damn ravioli bite of nacho goodness!) We sat at the bar and our waiter/bartender was so nice, full of energy and gave great advice. Would bring anyone here for good food and a great time."}
{"text":"Ambiance was amazing, we were thinking it almost had a lounge atmosphere and would be a wonderful place to come for drinks. Food was good, we were six people and that gave us the opportunity to taste all the appetizers, all of which were well done and tasted great. We ordered only two main dishes, smoked meat tacos and fish tacos. The first was delicious adding a Montreal touch to a Mexican favorite, the second was average at best as I could not even taste the fish, the sauce overpowered the ingredients. Some people may prefer the lack of fish taste ... but then what's the point. I would pick another dish next time. The service was odd at best, the wait staff at the table was good, no complaints there whatsoever, however the bartenders left much to be desired. When we entered the restaurant we were about 15 minutes early for our table and all of us wanted to have a drink at the bar. Unfortunately, we were constantly asked if we could go sit at our table, and only 3 out of 6 of us were actually served at the bar. My friend deduced they wanted us to clear the bar for people that may have come for drinks only. This is the first time this has ever opened to me and was not acceptable. To top it off, after we had been hurried to our table, pre-ordered drinks were not even sent to the table and upon inquiry we were asked politely to order from the drinks menu at the table (the Bourbon based El Chengon (spelling?) was delicious). All I can say is this may have been due to teething pains as it is a new restaurant, customer service was being traded for operational efficiency, hence the 3 stars and not worse, as the mostly great food offset the service issues.   It should be a quick learning experience in a city that has many great choices for restaurants.  We may visit again next year to see if things have changed as this place has good potential"}
{"text":"Ce qui fait tout le charme d'Escondite, c'est la déco ! Il suffit de franchir le pas de la porte pour être plongé dans un univers Mexicain qui fait rêver. Même si l'attente est un peu longue le soir, on ne s'ennuie pas avec tous les accessoires / peintures murales qu'il y a à observer !

Pour ce qui est de la nourriture, la carte est plutôt originale et le choix n'est pas très varié (ce qui est généralement bon signe). 

J'ai pour ma part testé :
- Le guacamole (simple mais efficace - de toutes manières le guacamole c'est la vie).
- Les ailes de poulet à l'érable et au chipotle (c'est pas très Mexicain mais c'était tout de même très bon), bien sucrées et un peu relevées.
- Les tacos Pollos Hermanos (petite référence à Breaking Bad appréciée), dans lesquels il y avait selon moi un peu trop de salade verte et pas assez de poulet.

Seul petit bémol: c'est ultra bruyant et ce même en semaine !"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of enjoying this last night, for a Tuesday night this joint was jam packed, we waited 10 minutes to be seated which was totally reasonable, looking around I noticed this looked authentic as it can get.

Once seated we took a look at the drink menu, it had a vast variety of beers, spirits and pitchers. I opted for a nice cold dos Equis, I may have spelt this wrong, I apologize in advance. We started of with a few guacamole served with there house made chips, the quac was great but the chips lacked a little salt, still pretty awesome. We also tried the cornbread with spicy butter, and my personal favourite , El Chapo, a spicy fusion of mexican/Asian chicken.... this dish was perfect.... the right amount of spice and flavour, incredible.

We took a few taco, Pollos Hermanos, yeah named after that breaking bad chicken joint I'm guessing, if your familiar with the show. Fried chicken tacos basically, can't go wrong with that. My meal was enjoyable and the price wasn't too bad either. Would definitely return and try some other tacos, maybe la lengua!"}
{"text":"Ordered the guacamole & chips, corn muffins, mango salad and fish tacos that I shared with a friend. All very delicious! Seemed trendy, but noisy."}
{"text":"I love Escondite's take on Mexican food. I'm from Mexico City. The food is not traditional, but man does it make me smile every time. 
The whimsical decor is awesome and crazy. It will make you laugh, take pictures and selfies."}
{"text":"Alsolutely delicious guacamole. The nachos has some spice on them. Eating them with the fresh guacamole is amazing. 
The price for the tacos is very reasonable. Small size so you can order more variety."}
{"text":"Nouvelle localisation sur la rue Drummond, l'autre se trouvant sur la rue Union. Premier essaie pour moi chez Escondite et j'avais bien hâte de découvrir leurs spécialités mexicaines. Nous avons débuté en partageant une bouteille de vin, quand même à 45$ pour du blanc. J'aurais bien aimé qu'il y ai plus de choix de pichets de cocktail, il n'y en avait qu'un seul, qui ne me plaisait pas.... Un bon pichet de mojito, de sangria aurait été sympa. Puis, avec ma copine nous avons opté pour 4 choix : le général tao version mexicaine, les quesadillas aux champignons et deux tacos : un au poisson frit et l'autre au chou-fleur frit. Tout était dans l'ensemble très bon, Le général tao était surprenamment très épicé et le quesadillas quant à lui était mon choix préféré, très goûteux, rempli de fromage et on sentait le goût du champignon de façon très évidente. Pour ce qui est des deux tacos, je les ai trouvé correcte, j'ai mieux aimé celui au chou fleur, mais il demeurait tout de même assez sec. Quant à celui au poisson frit, il y avait quelque chose dans l'odeur du chou et dans le goût qui ne m'a pas plu. J'ai adoré l'ambiance, le décor, excellent choix pour un rendez-vous amoureux ou entre amis. Profitez du fait qu'ils prennent les réservations afin d'éviter l'attente. Il y a deux services: un a 18h30 et l'autre à 20h30. Je recommande cet endroit pour partager de bons petits plats mexicains dans un décor bien particulier."}
{"text":"I've tried their union location before and really enjoyed it and this location was good too. The food and drinks are just as solid. The pork tacos and the steak tacos are my favourite and their churros are really good too ! We got great service and delicious food at a reasonable price. This location is still very fun with the decor and atmosphere but the win has to go to the union location for that. If you want to go at lunch make sure you have a reservation or you risk waiting minimum 20minutes but likely more because seating is limited especially for groups. This is a nice place for a date or a one on one outing but less for larger groups especially without a reservation. The food is really good though and service is always friendly !"}
{"text":"Went for lunch here with some colleagues and really enjoyed it ! Definitely make a reservation during peak times though or you risk not being seated because the place fills up fast ! We had the guac and chips to start and it was exactly very good -nice crispy house made tortilla and fresh tasty guac. We tried the steak tacos and fried chicken tacos , both were excellent and full of flavour but the standout for me was the steak taco. My coworkers also tried the pork and pineapple taco and fish tacos and they said they loved them both. We also ordered their version of general tao and I definitely recommend giving it a try. Some of my favourite items were the mango salad and the grapefruit salad , fresh and flavourful with just the right amount of spice. The churros were good but were just your regular every day churro , so still yummy but doesn't really standout against other churros I've had. I had a mojito with my meal as well and I have to say that was the one thing I was a bit disappointed with , it had a bitter after taste to it. The prices here are very reasonable and the service was friendly and efficient. They have both indoor and outdoor seating but the decor inside really adds to the experience. There is a fun energy to this place and I would recommend it for an outing with friends or a date."}
{"text":"I am giving this place a 5 star because the food and service was phenomenal. It is a Mexican restaurant and not a fancy or upscale place as I usually expect 5 stars to be but the food was amazing and the staff fantastic. The nachos were very unique, like dumplings with nacho topping and I could have eaten nothing but those. I had the shrimp tacos and my husband had beef and they were fantastic too which is why I am giving 5 stars, when it comes to this type food and place I could not imagine anything better."}
{"text":"Tucked away on Union Escondite is truly a gem and the word is out that this place is worth hitting up.  Even on a Tuesday the restaurant was packed so be sure to make reservations if you come.  It has a fun vibe to it and I love the quirky, Mexican-inspired decor.  

It's a tapas place so you order a bunch of dishes for tasting.  We were a group of 7 so our waiter made up a special tasting menu for us.  It consisted of a shrimp ceviche, mango salad, corn bread, quesadillas and chicken and cod tacos.  Everything was really delicious but the standout for me was the cornbread which was so moist and hot.  They also had put jalapenos in it which added a spicy touch to it.  I love spicy food so this was appreciated.  The quesadilla which had oaxaca and mushrooms were also a hit.

The cocktails were a little bit expensive.  The cheapest ones start at $11.  They were a bit weak considering the price but I did enjoy their takes on classics like the mojito.  

The service was great here.  It was speedy and the waiter was very friendly.  He also knew the menu very well so he was able to make some excellent recommendations for us.  Escondite turned out to be a great find and conveniently located near work so I would definitely like to come back here again in the future."}
{"text":"Overpriced Tacos. 
Cocktails are good. 
They really shouldn't charge for Salsa. 

As well, not accepting AMEX as an expensive bar. 
Overall= 
*Canadianized mexican non-spicy food*"}
{"text":"The food was ok but i give one star for the bad service. We were a group of 16. When we call to reserve we were told we don't qualify for group menu. Fine. Then when we got there the waiter suggested we take the group menu. Then we ask what it has, he just vaguely said well you will each get a portion of the most popular item on the menu... Which is??? He refuse to explore further in detail. So half of the table rejected the offer and decided to order a la carte, and when he bring us the bill he told us off by saying well if you take the group menu you would have paid 2 $ less...  I save 2$ force myself to eat things that I won't like?? Hello?? What waiter do that... Never again !!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and drinks, and great ambiance. The staff was very friendly as well. I always find myself thinking about those darn tacos!"}
{"text":"Un beau 4 étoiles pour l'Escondite! Le resto a ouvert ses portes depuis quelques temps déjà, mais je n'avais pas eu l'occasion de m'y rendre encore. Mon conjoint et moi avons remédié à la situation il y a quelques jours et nous n'avons pas été déçus! Tout d'abord, il faut savoir que vous DEVEZ réserver, même pour un mardi soir. Nous n'avions pas réservé et sommes arrivés un peu avant l'ouverture, ce qui nous a permis d'avoir une place au bar, les dernières disponibles pour la soirée. Niveau décoration, c'est assez cool. Il y a beaucoup à regarder! Autant la grande murale du fond que la multitude d'accessoires présents un peu partout dans le restaurant. L'endroit n'est pas très grand, on se sent donc rapidement \"ailleurs\". Nous avons débuté le repas avec des cocktails. Nous avons goûté au Mojito del King, qui était très bon. Nous avons aussi essayé le cocktail aux cerises (désolée le nom m'échappe), que nous avons moins apprécié. Chacun ses goûts! Ensuite, nous avons déguste plusieurs plats (nous avons UN PEU exagérés haha). La salade de mangue était très bonne, rien à redire. La sauce est un peu épicée, mais juste assez pour relever le tout. Le quesadilla aux champignons et pâte de truffe était gorgé de saveurs tout en restant très léger. On l'a dévoré. Niveau tacos, nous avons essayé celui à la morue croustillante et celui aux crevettes et chorizo. Dans les 2 cas nous n'avons vraiment rien à redire. Les plats sont si simples et savoureux à la fois. On goûte bien les ingrédients. Jusqu'à maintenant, ce sont les meilleurs tacos que j'ai mangés. En dessert, churros! Ils étaient très bons aussi. Bien croustillants à l'extérieur et tendres à l'intérieur, recouverts de sucre et servis avec une sauce au chocolat (Nutella?) Je retournerais à cet endroit n'importe quand. La bouffe est de qualité et très goûteuse. La seule raison pour laquelle j'ai enlevé 1 étoile est le fait que le resto s'est rempli très vite alors le service était très rapide, voire rushant! Je n'aime pas trop être pressée quand je mange, mais si vous n'accrochez pas là-dessus vous passerez une soirée parfaite! Niveau prix, les plats et cocktails énumérés ci-haut ont fait un total de 77$ (+ pourboire). Très raisonnable pour tout ce qu'on a mangé et les découvertes faites!"}
{"text":"Holy! The tacos here are amazing! Forget all of the tapas/small plate items. I'd say they are average at best. But the tacos absolutely blew my mind. I was here on a week long trip to Montreal, and we came here twice in one week. We couldn't get enough of these powerfully flavourful tacos. 

Al Pastor, Mole, Pollos Hermanos, E'Steak Koreano and La Tinga are definitely my favourites. 

This place is a must-try for the tacos alone! Get them all!"}
{"text":"J'adore vivre au centre ville de
Montreal parce que tout se fait à pied mais je trouve ça parfois (souvent) un peu plate en frais de restaurants. Il faut chercher un peu plus fort pour trouver dans cette mare de business de la nourriture sans chaleur ni passion un trésor. Mais ce Resto fait parti de mes coups de cur de quartier. Tout est bon au menu et particulièrement leur jalepenos corn bread. Great drinks too."}
{"text":"This was my second time at this restaurant. I came here a few years ago and I remember the food  and drinks being really good. I remember we got to try the bean soup for free and it was delicious.

I came her last night with my boyfriend at 6:30pm and it was already packed. We got lucky because we got seated at the bar. The people before us got seated outside and it wasn't very warm out. 

The bartender was really friendly. She gave us her recommendations and we just ran with it. Everything was delicious!! 

We first had the nacho 2.0. Don't let the name fool you this was definitely not nachos. It's a gyoza (dumpling) with Monterrey jack cheese inside with jalapeño, queso fresco, pomegranate pico de gallo, guacamole and black pepper créma on top. My boyfriend thought it was nothing special but I really enjoyed this. What's not to like?! Cheese dumplings with guacamole ...yes please!! 

Then we shared three tacos. The pork one (don puerco) , the steak one (E'steak Koreans and Nopal) and the chicken one (la tinga). All taco dishes come with two tacos so it's perfect to share and try a few. The pork and steak were my fave. The pork one was creamy and flavourful. The sirloin steak had Asian flavours in it. It was a bit spicy because of the pickled jalapeños and it was very tasty. My boyfriend's fave was the steak. The pork and steak tacos were soft shell tacos but the chicken one was hard shell. I was a bit disappointed that the chicken taco wasn't even a shell. It was like a round taco sheet with toppings on top. It was hard to eat and very messy. Luckily I later tried to eat it with a knife and fork and it was perfect because the shell was so hard that it cut nicely and it was easy to gather all the toppings necessary on the fork to get a perfect bite. The chicken almost tasted like pulled pork to me. I didn't really taste the chipotle flavour. 

Lastly we had the churros. There were three of them. It was crunchy and oh so good with the Nutella. I don't really eat dessert but I actually ate my whole churro and fully enjoyed it. 

The drinks also were very good. I started with the margarita medianoche (tromba blanca, suze , blood orange tamarind syrup and lime juice). It was a bit bitter and you could really taste the tequila. So if you like strong butter drinks get this one. My boyfriend started with the Kaliman cocktail which tasted like dessert in a glass and looked like a piña colada. It had rum, pineapple juice and cinnamon syrup. If you like sweet drinks get this one! Mojito del king was my favorite. It consisted of dark rum, lime juice, pineapple syrup, soda and mint. My boyfriend and I each got one. It was a bit spicy because of the jalapeño. So good! I like spicy drinks!  Sadly they ran out of the Los arangos reposado tequila which is my fave tequila. So instead we had the serpiente tequila as a shot. It's $2 more the premium one. 

I would definitely recommend this restaurant and would definitely come back. It's hard to find a good restaurant downtown so I'm glad this restaurant is around and closeby."}
{"text":"One regret - I did not take any pictures of the delicious food. 

The reviews are legit and this place is really that good. It is a mexican tapas food with a twist. 

For appetizers, they have nice selection of salads and nachos. I tried the mango salad - it was great (a bit spicy). 

For main course - you have the option of variety of tacos. I chose the tofu tacos. Tofu is nicely seasoned and marinated to perfection. 

Highly recommend this place to all."}
{"text":"Cool mexican restaurant ! Located on Union avenue in downtown Montreal near Phillips Square and opened since the end of April, I heard a lot about this place all over and finally tried out. I was not dissapointed at all. The place was jam pack, so popular. The waitress was like you have 1h to eat. Ok. A bit rush but it was worth it. Nice vibe, beautiful & authentic mexican decoration into a big industrial loft. Delicious guacamole 6$ for entrees, the ceviche 11$ was good, the ribs 13$ were so delicious, the tacos were ok, my michelada 11$ was refreshing. Service was very fast & pleasant, prices are good. Totally converted, I will need to good back to taste more of the menu + drinks. ¡Buen provecho!

5/5 visited in July 2015."}
{"text":"I went there on a Friday night and it was really busy! We were seated at the bar after about 10 minutes of wait and realized that the best thing to do for next time is to call and book a table ahead. Their salads are refreshing and light, medium portion. There are no main courses because it's mainly a bar and the ambiance& decor of the place are the highlights."}
{"text":"Nice Mexican bar/restaurant! I like the ambiance, food and cocktail there! Also, this place is super popular. So, better make a reservation before going!"}
{"text":"Super cute trendy deco. The ribs and fish tacos are on point! It's truly a hidden gem. If you're craving some authentic food I highly recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"I don't really fancy Mexican cuisine but I loved this Americanized Mexican food joint! 

Their Tapas : Alas de pollo( Maple and chipotle chicken wings) and corn bread was fantastic! Got to use my hands to finish off the wings though. 

We tried 3 Tacos:
Mole (pulled chicken) 
Pollos Hermanos(fried chicken)
Baja (cod)

Mole is now my favourite taco in town!! The other two were just as yum. 
Amazing ambience and service! Would definitely come back for their wings and tacos! 

Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I want there to eat around 9:30 pm and we wait a very long time to receive our food. The server told us that it never happen before. They had a rush for a big table so afterwards the kitchen was all messed up. So therefore, the server gave us free drinks and desserts. He was really nice and gave us an amazing service. A little expensive for the quantity but so good and worth it. Recommend !"}
{"text":"A refreshing and delicious take on Mexican cuisine. The nachos are quite surprising (you'll see) and pair perfectly with the pomegranate they are served with.
I tried many tacos. Cauliflower and chicken were good but not memorable. The steak tacos were amazing. The shrimp tacos were not to my liking, but every one else at my table absolutely loved them. Also, the corn bread and the ribs are particularly good, outstanding even.
This place gets quite busy so make sure you reserve. Service is friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Yes, yes, yes.This is my new favorite place downtown Montreal! I went there on a Friday night with my girlfriend and 2 other friends (Double date, yay!). We had a reservation and were immediately sat down on a nice tall wood table. 

We had the guacamole to start. It was DE-LICIOUS and served with homemade tortillas. Then we had the fried chicken taco- amazing. The ribs were also suuuuper tasty, fell right out the bone and basically melted in your mouth. The cocktails are cool and yummy and they have one choice of red wine which is also (surprisingly) good! Apparently they have a \"sampler\" deal you can order and get a bit of everything to try, probably worth a try too!

Don't be fooled by the outside of this restaurant, go in. You won't regret it. :)"}
{"text":"This downtown spot has great food and a fun, kitschy yet self-aware urban Mexican atmosphere. Plus they have Mezcal which, sadly, is nearly impossible to find anywhere else in Montreal.

I tried the ceviche, mango salad, fish tacos, veggie tacos, and key lime pie and all were \"muy rico\" in every way. Tons of flavor and super fresh. Ayayayaya!

Quite a few other Mexican spots have opened up in the city in the past couple years, and generally they are a little bit of a disappointment, but this place is super yummy and really fun.

Overall, Escondite is kind of a trendy spot with a downtown crowd which makes it a good place to go out to with a bunch of friends (it is definitely not a quiet family-owned restaurant). 

Check it out and make sure to try the Mezcal sampler. You won't regret it. Actually, you might the next day, but at least you'll have some good stories to tell."}
{"text":"I love this place!  High end so the servings are small compared to normal Mexican restaurants however, unique tacos and nachos.  The cauliflower tacos are amazing. As is the jalapeño corn bread.  As are the nachos- not chips but tiny pockets of cheese with all the regular nacho toppings.  Complete goodness.  I don't want to go home in 1.5 days.  The upside?  I get to visit one more time tomorrow. :)"}
{"text":"Great service.
The place is packed - a very good sign.
You will have to take a reservation if you want to go on a Friday or Saturday PM.
Every dish stands out and tastes wonderful.
The drinks are equally well thought out and executed.

Be ready to pay for those drinks though approx 11$ for 250mL.
So you go here to eat epic food. Black Cherry Chipotle ribs - I'll say no more."}
{"text":"Nice place and decoration, good food but the attention was regular, nobody at the entrance, the place was totally empty so we decided to get in and then a rude guy asked us to get out and wait for somebody to place us... No more comments..."}
{"text":"Very bad food and service, fuck! They have a very Rude and stupid manager! Do not go to to this restaurant, or you will be so mad and not respected! They don't know the customer is the god!"}
{"text":"Love this taco spot! Lots of great variety in their appetizers and mains. That said, make sure you try and get a reservation if you can. Any night of the week they can be totally booked by like 7pm."}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday evening (closed on Mondays!) around 8 and was greeted with a packed house. For our party of 2 we only had to wait for maybe 5 minutes which I felt was rare. 

Upon being seated, we were greeted almost immediately, even for it being incredibly busy. We took our servers advice at getting 2-3 plates per person & asked for 4 different tacos (they come in 2's), as well as guacamole to start. 

The guacamole was great, but what really stood out were the chips. Perfectly crisp & thicker than most Mexican places. You could tell they were incredibly fresh. 

Then came the tacos. We ordered the cauliflower, steak, chicken & pork (there were 2.. I can't remember which we asked for). My favorites were the cauliflower & pork. Though my boyfriends were the steak & chicken. Clearly you can't go wrong on either. 

The service was very prompt in that every time we had an empty plate, it was taken away. And when our water was low, it was filled right away. I can absolutely appreciate little details like this. 

I would definitely recommend Escondite if you're in the area looking for a great selection of tacos!"}
{"text":"Loved it!! Mango salad is great with a fun selection of tacos.. small yet lovely decor... the cauliflower veggie taco was the bombbbbbb!!! Make sure to have reservations as it's always bookes"}
{"text":"YUMMY.  I came here with two friends on a Tuesday night, and it was jam packed!  We ordered quite a few items: the jicama salad, the guacamole, shrimp ceviche, cod fish tacos, al pastor tacos, and churros.  Holy mother.  The ingredients were fresh and flavourful, the service was friendly, and I loved the location - it being slightly tucked away on Union Avenue right in the heart of the city.  It was also reasonably priced too!  I hope to return again!"}
{"text":"Definitely pricey for the portions but everything is so fresh, well-plated, and tasty. 

They somehow managed to make the baja fish tacos (which come in 2) light and refreshing despite the fact that they're stuffed with fried fish, and the ceviche was just the perfect blend of flavors and textures.  My friend also enjoyed the Nachos 2.0, but beware that they're actually dumplings, not tortilla chips.

We decided to splurge on the pitcher ($45) but it was very strong, so so pretty, and once we muddled up the jalapeños, it had a great kick to it, which complemented our meal really well.

The server was quite helpful with suggestions and recommendations about pairing and whatnot when we were conflicted about what to order. And the ambiance! So cool and cozy. Great decorations and perfect lighting. Overall, a 5/5 experience, aside from the pricing."}
{"text":"Love love love!  We went last year for lunch and last night for dinner. Truly amazing stuff. The outside looks awful, but the inside is beautiful and fun. And the food--oh my heavens, great! Take their advice on several things, but definitely get the ribs and the nachos.  We also loved the cauliflower tacos and guac. We did not love the margarita unfortunately but the jalapeño mojito was fab. We want to go here every day now."}
{"text":"Food isn't spectacular if you're looking for real fresh authentic Mexican food. The beer was warm before I even started drinking it which was also disappointing. Although, the place is well decorated- for those who take hipster pictures of every restaurant they go to."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant after being directed there by the matire d' of La Habenera because it was full.  This place was packed and raucous, but I snagged a seat a the bar. The bar tenders put on quite a show and the drinks are beautiful and tasty. Too bad about the food. It is kind of hit and miss."}
{"text":"Un délice de restaurant mexicain! Les tacos (8$ les deux) sont excellents et nous retrouvons l'ambiance parfaite du Mexique! Les prix sont un peu élevés à mon goût mais reste dans la norme pour une place en plein centre ville. J'ai adoré le guacamole et les churros en dessert aussi! La déco est magnifique et les fresques au mur sont très jolies! Petit bémol donc pour le prix, le bruit et le service approximatif qui ne parle pas très bien français (la serveuse qui s'est occupé de nous, je n'ai pas entendu le reste). Je reviendrais cependant sans hésitations pour y manger mexicain!"}
{"text":"I had the fried chicken tacos with iced margaritas and the guacamole chip app. Overall pretty good stuff but a bit small. My fried chicken was a little dry but it was my only minor hiccup. The chips with the gauc had a chile seasoning that I really liked. The iced margaritas were on point and quite refreshing. 

The inside was cool looking with funky seating, wall art and an outdoor patio. The service was super nice and chatty. Def a place to go have lunch or dinner and worth it."}
{"text":"Mexican friends would find the tacos too expensive obviously, but it's definitely cheap enough considering its location, decoration and quality of food! Cocktails are great and innovative, but i would highly recommend a tequila &  Mezcal tasting from private import! I won't call it a \"gem\" though as it's getting quite famous and it's obviously partnering up with other 'hipster' restaurants in downtown :)"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. It's everything it's cracked up to be and more! I knew I was in for a great meal when I mentioned to local colleagues I was planning to come here and everyone started raving about it. 

The interior is so cool and funky, with murals and art work and lots of little decorative things everywhere. The servers are super attentive, with very big biceps and/or tattoos. 

This place was hopping even on a Tuesday night. In fact, it looks like you probably need reservations if you want to eat here at all, if you're not dining by yourself. I was, both times, so I lucked out!

I tried a total of 4 types of tacos over two trips:

*Baja was delicious - creamy, savoury, crisp, and (relatively) mild. Very fresh ingredients and I love that they use cod instead of basa. Only minus is that the tortilla is cold and kinda doughy. 

*Lengua - ASTOUNDING. If you love tongue it's a must. If you haven't tried this cut of meat or if you didn't love it before, you will now! The peppery stout sauce it's braised in is just right. The garnishes are absolutely perfect - love the onions and shallots! The tortilla's all crisped up, as well. 

*Shrimp - very nice. The chorizos are unexpected and delicious, adding a bolder flavour to the sweet shrimp. I expected the shrimps to be mini but to my surprise, they're quite large! Only thing is I'd prefer if they weren't brined with baking soda to make the meat springy. I prefer dense shrimp meat. 

*El pastor - highly recommended by a colleague and i can see why! Strips of pork belly (right in that sweet spot where it's crispy on the edges and melty/unctuous inside) with grilled pineapple! It's sweet and smoky and savoury - the deliciousness will stay with you. The only downside is it's quite oily - the grease will soak through the crisped-up tortilla and leave a little puddle on the tray. But who cares?

This place is definitely going to be one of my regular spots when I'm in town. I can't wait to try their ceviches, churros, and more!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Montreal, hands down. Since moving here from the US, I've been struggling to find great or even decent Mexican food in the city. Escondite delivered both quality Mexican staples (the chicken tinga tostadas) and some great twists (don't skip the General Tso-inspired chicken!). Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The place isn't wacky Mexican decor like in Mexico, but rather trendy Mexican decor. 
Still very nice atmosphere, I'll give it that. 
It's a little drafty inside. 
They left a jug of water on our table but only cuz we asked them to. And then later took it away. 
They messed up our reservation and almost seated us at the bar. But somehow found us a table cuz of a cancelled reservation. And they gave us free shots of tequila for the inconvenience. 
The service is very friendly but slow. 
They also messed up our food order so gave us some extra tacos on the house. 

These are my thoughts on the food:
The guac is too salty. 
The nachos and quesadillas are oily. 
The mango salad is too sweet. 
The veggie, fish and chicken tacos are all Very fried and oily. The chicken ones taste like KFC in a taco. 
Wasn't a fan of the smoked meat tacos.  
There is only 1 choice of red wine and 1 choice of white wine. 

No offense but I won't come back. Montreal has much better Mexican restos."}
{"text":"Petit restaurant style tapas cubain. Beaucoup de choix de tequila, plusieurs même hors menu tellement la sélection est grande. La nourriture est tout simplement délicieuse. J'ai essayer la guacamole qui vient avec des chip fait de tortillas. Je dois dire que je n'aime pas la guacamole et les avocats. J'ai dévore le bol!

Ensuite des quesdillas au fromage et champignon. C'était bon, pas mon préférer n'étant pas un adepte de champignon, mais c'était non pareil.

Nachos 2.0, un must. Imaginer manger des nachos où les chips sont des genre de ravioli farci de 3 ou 4 fromage différent, le tout avec salsa, guacamole et 2-3 autres choses. À couper le souffle.

Par la suite, des tacos de poulet frit. Wow, j'aurais jamais pensé qu'un tacos puisse avoir un tel goût. Poulet frit, sauce Chipotle, assaisonnement et autre petite chose dedans.

Pour terminer, churros avec Nutella. Était très bon.

Certain diront que le service est un peu lent mais c'est un restaurant de type à 2 service, donc ce n'est pas un sit in, servit dans les 15 minutes et on part en 45 minutes.

Sommes toute, j'y retournerai certainement. Ce fut une excellente découverte lors d'un 5 à 7."}
{"text":"Menoum menoum menoum ! 

J'y suis allée sur l'heure du lunch et c'était bondé.. Avec raison ! Le service est courtois et reste à distance (ce que je préfère, comparativement à un service invasif). Nous nous sommes partagés les délicieux tacos Al Pastor (au porc) et El General Chapo (un genre de Général Tao). Côté prix, hyper abordable !"}
{"text":"The restaurant has a cool, carnivalesque interior as well as a patio (it's on an unassuming side street downtown, though you'll still get some traffic). More importantly, the pork and pineapple tacos were unreal. I could have eaten dozens. I regret not eating dozens. We split four orders of tacos as well as a guacamole starter and were left stuffed. My husband's only complaint was that the beer selection was lacking, but the cocktail list was decent and service was great."}
{"text":"Awesome decor. Very hip and cool little place. Walls are covered with cool art and interesting pieces. Tacos are amazing. Shrimp is probably my fave! The michelada is super authentic. Has the perfect balance of flavors. Cool little spot."}
{"text":"It's as good as everyone says! 

As a vegetarian, I was pleased to see the veggie options on the menu. I started with Nacho 2.0 and and corn esquite which were both equally tasty. Highly recommend nacho 2.0 - there are 5 gyoza with cheese inside, topped with a guacamole and a pomegranate pick de Gallo which complemented each other well. The corn esquite is a corn salad with garlic mayo and popcorn. 

For tacos, I went with two coliflor tacos. After the two appetizers which were spicy the cauliflower tacos felt a bit dry in terms of sauce. I added some Tabasco sauce on top and it was perfect with that addition. 

The restaurant has great decor with murals of dia de los muertos all over! And I received great service. Will definitely return."}
