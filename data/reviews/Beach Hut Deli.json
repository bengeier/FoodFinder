{"text":"I personally think bikini Wednesday is an awesome idea & all of the girls look bomb. Just don't bring your boyfriend around if you can't handle girls in bikinis.   The delish sandwiches don't hurt either :)"}
{"text":"One of the best sandwich shops in town. ..The pig kahuna is incredible! Everyone there is really nice and the set up is cool. Not the cheapest sandwich shop in town but definitely worth the money. Ive been twice now and will go back a lot more!"}
{"text":"Just happened to see the Beach Hut sign as I left BJ'S one night. I got really excited. This place is originally from my home town in Northern California. Some of the best and biggest sandwiches you'll ever have. I recommend the old favorite \"Surfin' Bird\" or if you're feeling like something really different try the \"Woody\" or the \"Pig Kahuna\". Everything here is amazing. You can't go wrong. Also, if you like good beer, try \"Eye of the Hawk\". This is one of the coolest locations I've ever been to. Lots of seating, including a large outdoor area that is great for lounging. They also have a few TV's, darts and beer pong available."}
{"text":"Great place for an awesome time and great food. Some of the best sandwiches in town. Steve and Courtney are great hosts.  Beach hut is a nice place to relax and hang with friends.  We go for trivia night every Thursday.  They have a great selection of craft beers on tap.  And the surfin bird is by far the best thing on the menu."}
{"text":"This place has the most amazing food ever!! Awesome beer selection, bottomless mimosas, TV'S everywhere and an entire outdoor seating area with games!! You can't go wrong here!! Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Ate at this spot this afternoon after seeing mostly favorable reviews on Yelp. For a quick summary: I could not have possibly been more disappointed. 

The menu looked fantastic, but a bit overwhelming.  The decor was cool and everything smelled great. I went with a pastrami and turkey on a French roll with pepper jack, chips and a fountain drink. 

The Co2 was out in the soda machine, so I went to the cashier to let her know, and to request a bottled soda instead. After waiting 5 minutes for someone to talk to, I gave up and just took the soda. 

I then waited outside for 20 minutes (literally) before going in to ask about my sandwich.  One of the employees apologized for the delay, which was cool, I get it things happen. He offered me a bag of chips to compensate for the delay, which was also cool but I'd already purchased (and finished) a bag. 

After 5 more minutes my sandwich came, and wow. The pastrami was so bland I'd swear it was roast beef. The turkey was decent, but it's almost impossible to mess that up. I asked for mayo and mustard, and received about a liter of each, globbed into the connected part of the roll. I had to rip about 1/3 of the bun off to use as a condiment squeegee in order to make the sandwich edible. Forced down the remainder and left as disappointed as my parents every time I brought home a report card. 

Cost for my terrible sandwich, soda and a bag of chips? $15 bucks, which was about $17 bucks too much. 

I'd love to say I will give this place another shot since it's so close to my home, but after the trifecta of bad service, bad food, and overpriced, I highly doubt it."}
{"text":"This place is literally the best place ever... The sandwiches are unbelievable and the service is nuts, the owners are so awesome and Melanie and Andrea super cool..."}
{"text":"Not too impressed with the rude staff.. Expected a little more in customer service. Wasn't entirely impressed with the food either... Won't be back with all of the other choices in the plaza. Was excited to try awhile ago but disappointed and won't be back in the future."}
{"text":"This place is really good. We tried it for the first time today in hopes of a good lunch spot. Sandwiches were great and big! We did not leave hungry at all. The options would fit anyone's taste. 

Cool vibe inside, and would definitely be fun for a brunch or happy hour! The patio was cool especially for fall or spring when it's not so hot. 

Only gave 4 stars because it was a little pricey for sandwiches but overall I would highly recommend. And we will be going back!"}
{"text":"This place is simply THE BEST Sandwhich place. 

I love me some Panera, Capriotti's, Port of Subs, Firehouse, and even Subway. This is the Rolls Royce of Sandwhich shops! Great portions, amazing and fresh toppings.  The service is great, they are all so pretty ;) 

I had tha Santa Cruz which is pastrami, avocado, bacon and cream cheese, and I'm pretty sure angel dust. It was heavenly! I can't wait to go back. 

My co-worker had the Haole Cheese Steak which is hot roast beef, Monterey jack, cream cheese, onions and peppers with a special spicy marinade, and nearly had to change his pants from excitement...

This place. I'm a fan. I was able to eat my huge sandwhich for Lunch, and Dinner. 
Please support this amazing establishment, I know I plan to."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I both had salads here a few days ago, and we both thought that they were just okay. He had the super salad, which wasn't really that super since it was lacking in toppings. The only protein on this salad is edamame and there were only 5 of them. The rest of the toppings seemed sparse compared to the amount of lettuce that was included. I got the Cabo salad, which had a good amount of toppings and chicken. It was a typical taco style salad. The tortilla chips on it seemed a little old and stale. We could have gotten tastier, better quality salads at Panera for a little less money. We thought that the salads were a little over priced for what you actually get. The restaurant itself has a really nice beach feel with cool decor and surf music. All of the employees were very friendly but we waited quite a while for two salads."}
{"text":"Everything about this place rocks my world! The atmosphere is casual and friendly! It has indoor and outdoor seating, TV's for the sports fans, and the food is delicious!  I don't think I can make sandwiches at home anymore (and I make a pretty good sammich!) It is so much better to get one from Beach Hut! They have so many choices-not only of sandwiches, but meats, breads, condiments and toppings. It is fresh and fast and served on a Frisbee-so it pretty much screams awesome!! They have beer on tap, ya can't beat beer, sandwiches and sports! But they do-their staff is friendly, fun and constantly making sure we have everything we need and want. Courtney and Steve are so nice, and really want to give the best service and food possible! I'm already eating there once a week, I think I'm going to have to make it at least twice a week!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best deli around!  I always get the Surfin Bird because it is SO delicious!  No other deli can match the variety and the deliciousness and the amount of toppings!  I recently tried the loaded potato soup as well and it was delicious!  The place is decorated in a beach theme and theres a variety of shows playing on the tvs all around the room.  The staff is always helpful and they make the sandwiches quickly."}
{"text":"I eat here pretty regularly. They have huge sandwiches, I can barely finish a small. The service is great, and it's pretty healthy food. I like that they post the calories of each sandwich on the menu. I'm a big fan of the surfin' bird. The outdoor seating is nice, but sometimes gets invaded with smokers. Great price for the quality and amount of food you get."}
{"text":"I was really impressed for about two when I started coming here on my lunch breaks from school. But then after a few days spending at least $10 each visit for a medium sandwich then $5 for chips and a drink. It sucks. I can't leave there without spending $18 on lunch and the staff isn't too pleasing. On a students tiny budget I don't think I'll be eating here anymore."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Had the Surfin Bird in a lettuce wrap and really enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the Santa Cruz and the sun burn sandwiches. Friendly staff very energetic and welcoming. It's almost like a family laid back island atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went there at about 750 tonight. I wish I could have tried this place because the smell was amazing! However, I stood at the front for about 7-8 minutes (no exaggeration, I was reading everything on the menu) and no one greeted me. I mean no welcome, no one even there to take my order. There were people in what I assumed was the back dining room playing around and a guy with his back to me on a laptop at a far counter. Otherwise it was a ghost town. Super bummed about the lack of service! I ended up leaving and hitting up another one of the dozen restaurants in the complex because afterall, I needed to eat.  I'll probably be back but I won't wait as long as I did, fool me once shame on you etc. There are tons of great sandwich shops in my area so if I get bad service again, I'll just continuing eating elsewhere."}
{"text":"I can't figure out why this place has an empty seat on Sunday afternoon. Indoor and outdoor seating with the most laid back atmosphere in Vegas. And here's the biggest problem: the sandwiches are so good you can't take a small bite. So you don't. You just shove your face right in there grin as sammich fillings drip off your face. Extra napkins are on the table."}
{"text":"Just had the santa cruz sandwich with pasatrami and bacon.  Pastrami was really good, but the bun was very soggy   and there was no cream cheese on it.  Very expensive 9 dollars for a small sub.  Very disapointed .  Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Made one of the greatest decisions I've made this week by trusting the great reviews of this awesome establishment!!! From the super laid back music, decor, and attentive staff. The food speaks volumes and not just in taste, the portions will knock your socks off (which is a good thing since you're technically at the \"BEACH!\") 

My husband and I shared the large \"Santa Cruz\" (hot pastrami, melted provolone, cream cheese, mayo, must, lettuce, onions, pickles, peppers, bacon, and avocado!!!) words can't explain the multitudes of flavor profiled in this beautifully built sandwich! The large was enough for us both along with a bag of \"dirty\" chips and a tall 32oz longboard lager to wash it down!!! Needless to say I'm one happy girl!!! 

If you are looking for amazing food, beer, music, and a great staff then this is definitely your place!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. 

The first time I tried Beach Hut I was on vacay in Reno. I had major sammich withdraws until they opened up this location. 

Beach hut really knows how to make a proper sammich, like the kind that barely fits in your mouth. I can't seem to get away from my plain and boring turkey and provolone even though I really want to try the Beach Meat Ball, and the Spicolli. My boyfriend is ridiculously picky about his sammiches, and this place nails it for him every time! 

Along with a great sammich, they have a decent selection of chips (not that crap you find at Port of Subs), and other munchies... try the chili nachos!  Plus you can wash it all down with an ice cold beer... great selection of micro beers. 

They have a nice size covered patio if you chose to eat outside, which isn't really common here in Vegas, but if you prefer to sit inside the booths are comfy, and there's even a comfy couch, so you can feel like you're having a sammich at home! 

I've yet to be here for any of the live music events, but I bet it would be a great time!"}
{"text":"Today was my first time coming here. I was really excited to try it out but I left incredibly disappointed. I waited almost 45 minutes for a sandwich. A SANDWICH. It wasn't worth it. The vibe inside is really chill and everyone is friendly but It's honestly RIDICULOUS to wait 45 minutes for a SANDWICH. Unless you have plenty of time to waste, I wouldn't recommend coming here."}
{"text":"My first time here and I like the place. Great sandwiches and salads made to order, they have beer and indoor outdoor seating.  Very comfortable and chill. My daughter and I had A GREAT  lunch. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So, I know that this place may not be for everyone, but for what it is I think it's the best that I've found in LV so far.  If you want a fully dressed sandwich that can be cold or hot with quality ingredients, this is the place for you!  They also serve beer, soups, and a variety of other things if you're not in the mood for a sandwich. There is indoor and outdoor seating, the employees are friendly, the prices match the size of their sandwiches, and the place is pretty slow...I know that this may not be a perk to them or everyone else, but when you want to go with a small group of friends and not be overrun by other customers it really comes in handy.  I really hope they're able to stay open, but I also really hope that it doesn't get too busy and we can continue to enjoy this small slice of sandwich heaven! :)"}
{"text":"Delicious and the only place i know where you get cream cheese in your sandwich. Mouthwatering goodness! So glad we discovered a new place to get great sandwiches."}
{"text":"Extremely unprofessional. My husband and kids ate here a few weeks ago and I watched as employees drank beer and took shots on the job. There was a female there that explained she was new and i felt so bad for her as the manager of the store and cooperate manager yelled at her for overcharging me. I didn't mind, i wanted a bigger sandwich anyways...but the way they treated that poor girl melted my heart. This restaurant should not be in business, I have worked at multiple restaurants around the valley and have never seen such an unprofessional place in my life!!! The girls shorts were so short they might as well just been in there underwear. As well as the shoes they were wearing, flip flops, boots, etc. I don't think cooperate is aware of how unprofessional this place is but they NEED TO MAKE CHANGES. I overheard employees discussing drug use, (marijuana and pills) and was floored. I then did research on this company and I  finally realized why its so unprofessional because they only have one location in Vegas which they obviously have forgotten about. Point being if you want to be in a place where the employees are unprofessional and drunk this is the perfect place for you. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL, DIRTY, AND THEY OBVIOUSLY DO NOT KNOW WHAT THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT REQUIRES TO WORK! TERRIBLE PLACE"}
{"text":"Yum! Super salad is fantastic! Sandwiches are really good too. Good service. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Deli Sandwiches and great beer. I should love this place, but I struck out. Again and again, first it closes way too early. So, it took a few attempts to try them when open. Then, finally, the stars aligned. The number of sandwich choices is a bit overwhelming. Most reviews raved over the cream cheese on the sandwiches since I don't dig cream cheese I was left uncertain on what to order. 

We asked for recommendations and settled on the turkey, avocado, bacon and provolone ($7.50 sm) and the pulled pork splashed with Tabasco BBQ sauce, cheddar and pineapple ($10.50). They have Kona on tap which is a huge win! We ordered two beers ($7.90 each). Rather than the cashier informing us it was happy hour, I happened to catch the sign in just the nick of time. He corrected the order, and we got 2-for-1 beers. Yeah! 

While we waited for our sandwich we admired the atmosphere and enjoyed our beers. We love the laid back beach atmosphere. Our sandwiches were brought over on Frisbees - love it. We dug into our sandwiches - didn't love it. 

The bread was thick, dense and while sturdy it wasn't too tasty. They lay it on thick so these are sandwiches for hearty appetites. However, the blend of fillings didn't thrill us. The turkey tasted purely like mustard, the avocado would shoot out the side every time I took a bite. It was difficult to eat about 1/2 way thru I gave up. The pork was ok, but it was ruined by the tabasco BBQ sauce. There was so much of it there was no way to escape it. It completely overpowered any taste of cheddar or pineapple. 

Perhaps we chose poorly, but these sandwiches came highly recommended. I'm not sure that I'd return to try others. It's a real shame because the beer options are fantastic. It'd be better if this was primarily a bar.

2.5 stars"}
{"text":"Solid sandwiches, good quality meats and interesting creations. The place is very nicely decorated, and there is an outside patio that on a nice day could be very enjoyable. 

Though service is a bit slow for a sandwich shop, it is totally worth the wait. Their serving are massive, I ordered a medium sandwich and could only eat half ( and trust me, I can eat).
What set my sandwich apart, was the Italian dressing, it brought all the flavored together and made it a very tasty meal. Even a better one a couple hours later when I ate the other half at work. 

Natasha (wife), got a turkey sandwich, it had bacon and avocado in it, the bacon was too crispy, and the cream cheese was just chunked in there, maybe great for some people but she didn't care for both the bacon or cream cheese. Once she removed those ingredients, she enjoyed her meal.

Totally worth another visit and try a couple more of their sandwich creations."}
{"text":"This is the best place to get food and beer in Las Vegas. Period. The team there is awesome and the atmosphere is like nothing else in Las Vegas. I am a beer and food fan. I am not a gambling fan. This rules out 99.9% of bars in Las Vegas. Beach Hut is the only .1% that I have found. 

They have about 6 revolving taps but always have Eye of the Hawk on tap (which if you haven't had, please turn off your computer and go to Beach Hut and order a pint). If you like craft beer, this is the place for you. (btw all beers are happy hour cheap... seriously)

Now, the food. Well what can I say? The sandwiches are huge, delicious, customizable, and bacon is always at the ready. They have some really amazing combinations that are just amazing.

There is outdoor seating (which is nice if you regularly dine in the local caves), indoor seating, big TVs with sports or the Food Network on, reggae playing, super chill atmosphere. They have bands play there every now and again at night. 

TL;DL: Bomb Food, Bomb beer, Bomb people, just go and have a sammy and a pint- thank me later."}
{"text":"This was good--I need killer bread on a sub to call a place \"great\", but when it comes to being generous with the toppings, Beach Hut Deli is in front of the pack.  As you walk in, there is a large menu posted on the left hand side of the room. Decide there and move to the register to order. I was dining with a group of low-carbers so each of them ordered their meals with no bread. Apparently at BHD that is code for \"make me a lettuce wrap\". 

My sandwich was LARGE. Check the photos from this place. They are not skimpy on the ingredients by any means. I had extra vegetables on my wheat sub and had to pull it apart to start to eat. There was nothing outstanding about the bread or the turkey. In fact, the bread fell apart quite a bit as I was eating. It made for a messy, but satisfying meal. I don't think I have had a sandwich with so much vegetable topping on it anywhere else. 

They did not season the sandwich (that I could tell) much and the side of Italian dressing was necessary for me to enjoy the meal. 

I think the best thing about BHD is how much care they put in their wraps. The low-carbers were VERY satisfied with their meals. One low-carber even had a hot dog wrapped in a bunch of veg and lettuce. I didn't have the heart to post that very odd looking photo. Sorry Mike T. Often when I order wraps the food is messily falling out of the wrap. No so at BHD; they know how to deal with the no-bread issue. 

All in all, the food was solid and plentiful. I appreciate the value and I will be back."}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches. Steve, the manager, is such a great guy. Excellent service. And live music on fridays! Super fun for the family to go to. And they have really good craft brew on tap. I recommend the santa cruz or the surfin bird. But seriously, every sandwich we've tried so far is so full of meat and toppings, they're all amazing. Not to mention the genius addition of cream cheese to various sandwiches. Check it out if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"I accidentally came across this place doing job applications with my friend. We originally went in because we needed water but the menu board was so enticing. The sandwiches have a unique variety and some great ingredients like avocado and bacon... my favorites. They use cream cheese on the sandwiches... who knew it worked so well! Absolutely delicious. Sadly, I live on the east side and it's so far from me. But any change I get to be I on that side of town I definitely eat there. The staff was nice and they have a great little shaded out door seating area. It wasn't too busy when I went, I imagine it can get busy though with those sandwiches! Ugh, cant get enough. I love finding places like this."}
{"text":"First of all the girl working at the counter had no clue what she was doing, nor did she care. I was immediately turned off but was hungry & in a hurry. After navigating her cash register with the ease of a drunk toddler my bill came to $12. Twelve dollars. What did I get for my hard earned $12? A 6\" hot sandwich & small soda. Wow. This better be the best sandwich ever. 

Well, they couldn't even provide that. I ordered one of the only things on the menu that didn't say spicy (and shouldn't be spicy). Get back to work, first angry bite in my mouth lights up like the Fourth of July. Spicy as hell. So now I have a bad experience & $12 down the drain on a to-go deli sandwich. 

Needless to say if my sandwich needs ever arise again I will be venturing to a sit down restaurant. I will pay the same price but not get a shitty Subway-esque sandwich."}
{"text":"Beach Hut is always delicious! Great atmosphere, friendly staff, excellent food. Try the Santa Cruz, it never disappoints!"}
{"text":"It's July 5th my husband and I have some friends in from out of town who want to watch the World Cup. I've never been here so my husband and I thought we would check it out. This place lacks customer service to the fullest!! I want to rate it a negative Star. There are three customers in the entire place when I arrive, so when I walk in and see two employees I thought I would get a, \"Hello, hi.\" Something shoot just some eye contact would be great. So I choose a seat while I'm waiting for my friends and husband.  There aren't any menus on the table and since the waitress does not care to greet me or ask if I would like something to drink, I stand up and ask the waitress if she has a menu. I ask two other times and she doesn't even look at me, finally a mail server walks up right next to her and notices me asking for a menu and he hands me one. I tell him there will be more people coming so I will need a couple menus. He walks away and never comes back. Meanwhile I sit down and start looking at the menu. I look around and see the NOT so friendly waitress go outside and start straightening chairs. At this point I am ready to leave, however I had to wait for the rest of my party to arrive so that we can decide on where to go. I would think taking care of customers is more important than pretending to straighten the patio. The place was practically empty (I doubt there was much to clean). If the owner of this place is having a problem with retaining or gaining new customers you might want to send in Restaurant Rescue to watch your servers. They are not doing a good job. I'm disappointed to see the bar for customer service is set so low. I didn't even get a chance to taste anything from the menu so unfortunately I cannot give a rating for the food at Beach Hut.

Disappointed customer"}
{"text":"Just drove by and saw the place and had to give it a try and I'm glad i did it was amazing probably the best sandwich iv ever had! I will defiantly be going back."}
{"text":"Pretty good sandwich! People was nice there. I ordered a small and it was more than enough. They give you A LOT. Definitely worth the price tag. Am a fan."}
{"text":"A great sandwich shop with a relaxed island vibe.  The \"Pig Kahuna\" is great, but the Malibu is by far my favorite. I always want to try a new sandwich but every time I go I can't imagine anything being as good as the Malibu!   The staff is always nice and you can't beat sitting on the patio to eat when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"Pricey but worth it! Amazing sandwiches and awesome atmosphere! I've had the Santa Barbara and the tuna sandwich. YUM! Definitely a new favorite place that I will be frequenting! Capriottis is the only other place that has sandwiches this good but the atmosphere here is so much better. The outside seating area is so nice and relaxing."}
{"text":"My go-to sandwich place. You had me at cream cheese!! Great music, huge sandwiches and great staff! I recommend beach hut to all!"}
{"text":"Although the food is good customer service could use some attention. What happened to the customer is always right every order I heard someone give the girl she said she couldn't add something or change the way that the item comes. I wanted to add some extras on an order of nachos and was told no. Not very pleasing to someone who comes here frequently. Seems like they could do without my business."}
{"text":"Believe the hype!!! Best sandwiches in the area. A little pricey,  but worth every bite!  I'd suggest getting the Santa Cruz or the Malibu, the top 2 in my opinion"}
{"text":"Great service!  We ordered a take out and they were very kind to separate items and made everything that much fresher for when we got to our destination. 

 The location was good and looked like a fun place to enjoy a meal. Was actually surprised by their outdoor seating area and that they had beer. In Vegas you can't find many places that offer a cute outdoor area and this one looked nice and tucked in and back a little from the sidewalk. Nice ambiance. 

The sandwiches were yummy but couldn't imagine having them daily for sake of calorie intake. 

The Surfin Cow on Sourdough was stacked high with roast beef and they absolutely don't skimp on the cream cheese. 

Marley Nachos were my favorite. I loved the melted cheese with added bonus of gobs of cream cheese. I'm a tomato fan and these were fresh and tasty.

Hobie- was so good with the dressing. And again they were so nice to put the dressing on the side so the sandwich wasn't soggy. We had plenty of left overs to make multiple meals out of one order.

Potato Salad was also amazing in taste and freshness."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for a salad. My favorite is the chef salad without avocado. I get extra thousand island dressing because it's amazing! I can barely finish the salad because it has so many toppings. (Chopped ham, turkey, salami, cheddar and monterey jack, tomatoes, onions, and Greek peppers. Topped with crumbled bacon and sliced avocado.)

I tried the High Tide sandwich once and it was incredible! (Chopped pastrami, ham, crumbled bacon, cheddar and pepper jack, on sliced, toasted, garlic cheese bread, with fresh-made thousand island dressing) I stick with the salad though because I try not to eat bread that often.

The restaurant is casual and has indoor and outdoor seating. The location is super convenient on S Eastern Ave, close to the 215.

I had one bad experience which almost made me never come back. I did not let that change my rating today. So, my rating is 100% on the food, not the service."}
{"text":"So good!! Awesome variety of toasted subs. The bread was perfect. They had a ton of options. And best of all, they had options that were different than the million other sub shops out there. 

They had a big screen and a comfy couch, so we got to watch some baseball playoffs while we waited for our subs to come out. So worth it!"}
{"text":"Just so damn good. 

So far I havent had a bad experience here. It is clean, workers are upbeat and friendly. More often than not they have good games on with cool beers on tap. Though I haven't taken them up on bottomless mimosas that is in my future! 

Everything I have tried has been delicious thus far. I'm curious to try the salads but I am a creature of habit and the spicoli, north shore, and beach comber are where its at. Great little spot, if you are wanting a sandwich this is the spot."}
{"text":"Amazing! 
The food-FANTASTIC but beware... its addicting! We go in a few times a month and have NEVER been let down. The staff is always upbeat and personal. The tunes are great! Excellent selection of Beers to wash em down. Go there! You wont be sorry you did!"}
{"text":"This deli was pretty good.  The sub I had was tasty but extremely greasy.  At the end of the day I would definitely go back and try it again but I wouldn't get a different sub.  Their sides were incredible though."}
{"text":"I've decided that I'm a sandwich type of gal.. Especially that I've tried Beach Hut Deli today!

Located besides Pin Kaow, right behind BJ's! Another place close to work and great for lunch!

Coworker and I decided to get two different sandwiches and split it!
All regular sandwiches include mayo, mustard, pickles, tomatoes, lettuce, red onions, peppers and cheese!
She got the Surfin' Bird - turkey, avocado, bacon and cream cheese on a wheat roll.
Cream cheese sounded odd to me but biting into the sandwich was amazing! Creaminess of both the avocado and cream cheese complimented the savory turkey and bacon! 
I got the Hobie - Italian dry salami, pastrami, provolone and Italian dressing on a sweet French roll. Meaty, very tasty and even though my vinaigrette was pouring out of my sandwich it was not over powering. 
Fresh veggies for sure and not drenched with mayo and mustard! Great baked breads also! 

I see myself coming back here for lunch again!"}
{"text":"Stopped in a Saturday night and walked into what could I thought was some sort of Rogers & Hammerstein's revival of the \"South Pacific.\"  The band/karaoke was so loud it was difficult for me to process the menu let alone actually verbalize my order. Not to worry if the noise is not your thing, there is a covered outdoor patio area to seek shelter for your ears.  Luckily I had a good idea of what I was going to order based on previous reviews.  I went with The Pig Kahuna.  The GF chose The Spicolli which was an awesome combination turkey,melted cheese, ranch and bacon.  The boy ordered a meatball sub.  Probably the greatest of items ordered were the Marley Nachos.  I disregarded the bread (sadly) on my sandwich but at the hell out of the nachos.  BHD is tasty, serves beer and I look forward to my return."}
{"text":"Excellent spot for some refreshing food in the Vegas heat. The staff is super polite and were so helpful with my toddler getting her some juice and giving her a free grilled cheese when her finicky toddler tastes weren't up for the sandwich we ordered her. THANK YOU!!!"}
{"text":"Hair cooked into your food= no return visit.  

Its unfortunate that I won't be back to Beach Hut Deli.  The service is generally friendly and good.  My last and final visit didn't reflect the norm.  

I ordered the Beach Bikini Sandwich and my husband ordered the Buffalo Grilled chicken Salad.  He had to ask 3 times or the salad dressing before any was brought to the table.  Half way through eating he pulled up a piece of grilled chicken that was still attached to the chicken on the plate.  It was attached by a very long hair. Immediately we all lost our appetites.  

We didn't tell the employees before throwing our items away and leaving.  I didn't want anything back or our order remade.  It was just a queasy feeling afterward.   

Wearing hairnets should always be mandatory while working in a kitchen.  I hope they fix this issue."}
{"text":"The sandwiches were pretty impressive on the first visit to this cute beach themed place. The pig kahuna that my husband ordered had bbq pork that was sweetened and topped with chunks of juicy pineapple. My \"small\" sized sandwich, if you want to call it that had pastrami, bacon and cream cheese which was stacked pretty high. All the sandwich combos sounded great and tasted really good. There is no table service. You order and pay at the counter and your food is brought out to you.
   
The staff was friendly and helpful, met and chatted with the owner who was really enthusiastic and come to find out he also grew up in the Bay Area.  But subsequent visits here were a tad disappointing.  I met up with a friend of mine for lunch few days later.  I ordered a different sandwich, Haole Pizza and my friend had the Santa Cruz.  I don't know mine tasted too salty, maybe it was because it was the meats weren't the best quality. But even the presentation was a bit sloppy, like it was just thrown together and same went for my friends sandwich, it was just thrown together, unlike how mine looked originally.  It also took awhile for the sandwiches to be done because there were 3 orders ahead of us first and only 2 ladies working the counter. Maybe because it was different staff??  So this visit wasn't quite as impressive as the first. And I was disappointed because I dragged my friend here, when we would've gone somewhere else that day.

I came back couple weeks later again for lunch and ordered one of the  sandwiches we had in the first place, the Pig Kahuna and this time around I had the Surfin Cow.  Now that was pretty good, the lean roast beef stacked high, but Mr. B's sandwich, the  Pig Kahuna wasn't as impressive this time around.  It was drowned more in sauce and just had a few pineapple chunks that dotted his sandwich. It tasted just way too salty as well because of all the sauce. He was fine with it, but I just have a thing for when there is  lack of consistency when your food is prepared.  So I havent been really motivated to come back as of late.  Sorry."}
{"text":"I am a deli and sandwich lover and this place ranks at the top for me! Awesome sandwichs, really friendly employees, good beer, and overall a great spot to chill and have a good sandwich. Definitely recommend trying this place out."}
{"text":"Hands down, my most favorite sandwich shop in all of Vegas. The Surfin' Bird is my usual go-to and it's incredible. Beware, the portions are HUGE so I usually just go for the small (medium if I'm really hungry or just really ambitious). Sitting out on their patio with a cold beer and sandwich on a warm afternoon....perfection."}
{"text":"First timer. Excellent menu. Fresh food was delicious and the service was great! Love the reggae music and they have a huge comfy outdoor patio for when it cools down outside!  Good food for kids. They split their sandwich without me even asking :) I had the Mesa salad regular size and wasn't even able to finish! Huge portion size was nice (and trust me, I like to eat!!!) Definitely coming back for $2 happy hour!"}
{"text":"I did not have a great experience with the people here. The staff wasn't polite and my sandwich wasn't great for the price."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sandwhich shops, they serve up some rather large sandwhiches packed with flavor in a laid back island themed environment. I find myself coming here for lunch often and would definitely reommend trying both the skinny dipper and woody.

As an added bonus the place also has a small selection of beer on tap and covered outdoor patio seating."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches, very fresh, big portions! The Surfin Bird is my favorite by far. Turkey, bacon, avocado on wheat bread toasted is so yummy! I like how they give you a decent amount of meat on your sandwich unlike most sandwich shops. We go here very frequently and love it every time! Highly recommended for a great sandwich!"}
{"text":"The Beach Hut Deli is a fantastic sandwich shop with a Mellow beach vibe!.  The sandwiches are huge with fresh meats and vegetables available in 3 sizes. I can't finish a medium and would most likely need a friend to finish a large...  This is my 4th one here and I have had a different sandwich each time.  The menu is expansive and covers all the bases for styles and meats and imaginative combinations that you have never thought of!!       The place it's self is very comfortable and spacious with a out door covered patio and there is a couch area around a tv for group sports watching!! 

Bottom line... If you are a fan of sandwiches  this place should be next of your list to try!!"}
{"text":"I've heard soo many great things about beach hut deli so I just had to come in a try some of their subs. Came in with my boyfriend and first we thing noticed was the decor and ambiance, which was great. We were greeted once we came in and the place just looks awesome, plus there's outside seating! On their menu they have very fun names for the subs and it was so hard for me to decide since they all seemed really good. My bf got the \"big kahuna\" and I got the \"drakester\" after the worker highly suggested it to my indecisive self. We were both disappointed. Idk, they were both just missing the \"wow factor\" haha. Or maybe we just had super high expectations from the reviews. Nonetheless, fun spot with awesome happy hour deals and they even do some occasional celebrations with beer pong etc! Pretty awesome! Maybe we just need to try something else next time"}
{"text":"The best part of this HUGE HUMONGO sandwich is the cream cheese.  The cream cheese compliments the sandwich and boosts taste by like a million.  It's THAT good. 

***On the menu it states how many calories your consuming with each sandwich..... and just fair warning.... it's DELISH and will consume ALL your calories for the day and probably for the next day.   IT IS HUGE! 

My favorite sandwich is the Santa Cruz COLD.  Pastrami, avocado, bacon, and cream cheese.  A small is 790 calories.... OF YUM.  They don't skimp on the fillers believe me.... They hook it up with a fat sandwich.  

The Haole Cheesesteak is definitely an amazing hot sandwich worth trying.  

It is a fairly new place, and there are a lot of friendly faces to recommend and help you out.  DUDES! come and try something!  It's a cute little place off of Eastern in a really busy plaza.  It's surrounded by a lot of good eats, but definitely come and try this place.  There's a nice seating area outside, and lots of seating inside too.  

On the weekend they have a nice little farmers market and The Beach Hut Deli would be an ideal place to grab some lunch for sure.  

 I work in this plaza and when Friday comes around I'm usually the first to want to grab some lunch from there when I want consume ALL my calories for the day.  :P  It's worth it!"}
{"text":"Love this place! $15 for bottomless mimosas on Saturday & Sunday. Also, the sandwiches are delicious & the service is wonderful!"}
{"text":"The outdoor seating, groovy tunes, beachy decorative motif, and friendly staff make this place stand out. But they also have giant-sized sandwiches for good prices (a small is more than a single meal for me), and alfalfa sprouts available as a free add-on!

After reading Brooke P's glowing review, I picked the Surfin' Bird, with tons of fresh-sliced turkey, crispy bacon, avocado AND cream cheese, the usual suspects (LTOP), the sprouts I requested, and an extra pop of flavor from Greek peppers! I dig it! A small lasted me two lunches.

Staff were super sweet during my visit: sauntered in off peak times but was immediately greeted and walked through the menu, and sent off with a cheery and genuine, \"Have a great day!\"

I may be able to make a sandwich myself, but not this good. Or this big. And they don't come with a side of surfin' sunshine spirit. When I find myself on this side of town again, I'll be back... for the Beach Bikini, on Dutch crunch!"}
{"text":"Came in here for lunch on a Sunday after stopping by the little farmers market they have setup on Sunday. 

The place was dead empty not sure if it's because of the farmers market or because everyone seemed to be at the crepe place next door. 

I had the skinny dipper, which is a roast beef dip. 

The sandwich was very flavorful and the au ju was very delicious and provided more than enough au ju. 

The roast beef was tender and the bread was amazing. Just wish it had more of a horseradish kick to the sandwich. 

Service was very friendly and top notch and they have lots of tvs and played every football game on at the time. 

Will definitely be back here to try some of their other sandwiches."}
{"text":"By far the best sandwiches in town. They are a chain but we only have one in Vegas so far. My favorite is the Santa Cruz heated. Yum.... Speed of service ok. If your in a hurry call ahead. Prices are a little high but well worth it for what you get. They serve alcohol and have an outdoor area to hang out. Sometimes they have live music. Love this place"}
{"text":"This is a great sandwich spot. And it's so much more too. I love the beach theme. The staff are super friendly, nice, and patient. They have a decent sized menu of cold and hot sandwiches, many quite unique. They also have hot dogs and nachos, as well as sides like mac salad and potato salad. They have multiple sizes for each sandwich and even offer a \"dude/dudette\" size that is half of a small sandwich (which is like a full size sandwich to me). They even have beer! And a happy hour! It's much bigger than it appears from the outside. There's a cute little bar area, large TVs, and even an outdoor area with darts and everything. And on the weekends, they offer $5 bottomless mimosas. $5! In other words, I have found a new spot to hang out. You order at the cash register and then they bring you your food when it's ready. The staffer who rang us up checked on us multiple times, offered to-go lids, etc. Very good service. And the sandwich and mac salad I ordered were wonderful. The sandwich I got was a play on a cheesesteak with roast beef, cheese, cream cheese, and peppers. Unique and seriously tasty. If you want a good sandwich, come here."}
{"text":"Awesome. Love that atmosphere, the food and the staff. Very chill vibe, which is awesome to find in Vegas!"}
{"text":"One star for the food only. The price and service are ridiculous. Two small signature sandwiches. Two kids subs (cheese only). Two bags of chips. One fountain drink. $36. I've literally been waiting for 40 minutes. There was one family ahead of 3 ahead of me and they haven't even started my order yet. One girl making sandwiches while one guy watches (he's training and hasn't learned to actually make sandwiches yet)."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and good customer service. Get the Pig Kahuna and their potato soup-it's amazing. A bit pricey but tastes great. They offer food to go as well!"}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE Beach Hut Deli!!!!!! My coworkers and myself go here often for lunch and are always satisfied. These sandwiches are the real deal, from my daughters favorite \"spicolli\" to the best sandwich on the menu, the \"Drakester\". The service and family feeling that this restaurant demonstrates makes my friends, family and myself want to eat here often, oh and the excellent sandwiches help!!! My goal is to try every sandwich they offer, so far I have tried 8 different ones. I recommend the Drakester first and foremost followed by the Shark Bite!! The Drakester is a hot turkey sandwich with melted pepper jack cheese, creem cheese and a couple of green chilis all on toasted sour dough bread. By far the best sandwich I have ever had. Oh and the plates that the meal comes on is a frisbee, kids 8 and under get to keep em!!"}
{"text":"Quality food, cute environment, unique and tasty sandwich combos and they serve beer!! We are going to try breakfast next time. We'll be back."}
{"text":"One word. Cream cheese. Eh, two words, I guess. Ha. 

If you don't like cream cheese - you probably won't like this too much. I mean, yes they have sandwiches  that don't have cream cheese - but a majority do. And yes, you can ask for them without the cream cheese - but why mess with their signature creations? 

Portion sizes are pretty good. I get pretty full after eating one sandwich. I will admit though, I had one fatty day at that place. My friend and I couldn't decide - so we both ordered one sandwich and another one to share, plus the Marley Nachos to start with. Damn, i was full. I'm not a big fan of taking leftovers - nor do I like throwing away food, so I forced myself to eat everything. It was one of the best worst decisions I've made. 

The Marley nachos (onions, peppers, avocado, cream cheese, bacon and a few other items) sounded delicious. Kind of disappointed. It wasn't as good as it sounded or as I was hoping. I probably wouldn't get them again, but they weren't disgusting. Just wasn't my style - but my friend loved it. I'll leave it to you to decide. 

The Santa Cruz (pastrami, avocado, bacon, and cream cheese) is definitely one of my favorites. How can you go wrong with any of those items? 

In a strip mall, that's filled with at least 6 other places to eat - beach hut is definitely a stand out. Do yourself a favor and try it out."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time yesterday. Had a hard time deciding because they all sounded delicious. Had the \"Malibu\" and would definitely recommend it if you're a fan of pastrami!"}
{"text":"Eating healthy is great, but hard to find around here for a reasonable price. 
We shared the Surfin' Bird 12\" sub sandwich - can we say Yum?! It was $13 for it, but the quality was well worth it.

When they guy, i think the owner, says it was pretty big to feed the 2 of us...he wasn't kidding. Granted my husband can eat a whole foot long subway sandwich himself, he ate half of this bird along with 1/4 of my half... and he was full. The sub alone is packed with enough turkey, bacon, avocado, cream cheese, and lettuce to feed almost 2 1/2 peeps. Not only is the bread super soft and fresh, but the bacon...oh the bacon - it was soo crispy, just how i like it. 

The only thing it lacked was not enough peppercinni's (which i love the kick in my subs), and the service can use help as we waited longer (for just sandwiches) than we anticipated. Can't imagine how long the wait would be if there were more than 6 customers in this place.

We hope they don't change the portion of their food down later on, as they are still new.  Can't wait to try the other subs and pizza's! I would recommend adding some desserts or other alcoholic drinks in that place cause it's soo big."}
{"text":"My family and I ate here today based on yelp reviews. The cashier who took our order seemed to have issues concentrating. When we got our food instead of the Marley nachos we ordered we got an half order of plain nachos. They corrected the order and we ate our meal. The same women who took our order was screaming and singing \"Let it Go\" from Frozen then she jumped on the manager and wrapped her legs around her. We tried to ignore and finish our meal which also included the Woody sandwich. 

I then got up to use the restrooms. The same women then goes to bus our table but then tries to pick up my son from the high chair. My husband told her no and she still tried. My husband could smell beer on this women. My husband pulls my son out of the high chair to get him away from her as I'm walking back to our table. This women then grabs my sons arm. And drags him behind the bar as I'm following after her to get him back. I had to say no then pick up my son. 

She shouldn't have been allowed to work. Then we come to find out that she was a corporate employee. No on intoxicated should be allowed to work they should be sent home. You especially don't GRAB SOMEONES CHILD."}
{"text":"My wife and I had lunch here today.  It totally rocked!!  The sandwiches were amazing.  They do not skimp on the meat, if you're into it.  The veggie sandwich options are much better than other places too.  Great bread, great and FRESH toppings, all sliced in-house.  Steve, the owner was there and talked to us about the place.  He's cool, gregarious and he's got a winner here.  Love the vibe and love the food more!  We're going back.  A lot!!"}
{"text":"Went to lunch here today, heard many good things about this place so I figured it was about time. I ordered the drakester with light cream cheese because my husband insisted I tried it with the cream cheese....well the cashier in training mixed up the sandwiches and put light on my husband's instead of mine so when I got my order it was FILLED with cream cheese....not being a fan of complaining in resturants cause I know people make mistakes, I decided to give it a try...NOPE couldn't do it,  warm cream cheese is definitely not for me....so i took it up to the cashier and apologized for returning it but asked if I could get one without cream cheese instead....no hesitation or questions asked, they remade my sandwich and offered me a free side for the mix up. Finally getting to try this amazing looking sandwich, I took one bite and OMG, the taste of amazingness. :) :)"}
{"text":"I wasn't as impressed with Beach Hut as many of my fellow yelpers are. 

I walked in at about 12:30 p.m. and grabbed a menu and sat down, browsing yelp suggestions and hungrily mulling over the menu. I finally decided on the \"Surfin' Bird\" sandwich (turkey, avocado, bacon and cream cheese). The menu says alfalfa sprouts are available on request. I requested them and was informed that they were out. Before I ordered, the lady in front of me was informed that they were out of chicken and roast beef. How can a deli run out of these things? I'm not sure. 

About 20 minutes later (seriously, 20 minutes to make a COLD sandwich that has 4 main ingredients?), my sandwich was ready. I grabbed it and left because I was slightly annoyed with the general attitude of employees. There were three employees and maybe four customers, including myself, waiting for sandwiches. The employees looked like they were just hanging out at work, not being very friendly or helpful and didn't seem to be putting too much effort into making my sandwich in less than 20 minutes. 

When I finally bit into the sandwich, I was very unimpressed with the quality of turkey. It tasted like watered down, pre-sliced, prepackaged turkey from a family pack of processed meat from Walmart. Seriously. THE MEAT makes the sandwich -  not the cream cheese (which I didn't really enjoy too much either) or the various lettuce/tomato/onion toppings. I don't like slimy deli meat. If you do, this is your place?

I wanted to love this sandwich, particularly since everyone raves about it and loves the unique cream cheese addition. But, I didn't love it.  I actually didn't like it very much either. 

I probably won't be back. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing, maybe they had an off day, maybe it doesn't usually take 20 minutes to make a sandwich when there are three employees and literally four people in the restaurant, and maybe $10 is a fair price to pay for a small sub (NOT!!!). But, probably not."}
{"text":"Ate here yesterday. Loved the atmosphere, and the staff was friendly. Ordered the woody, messy but delicious! Cream cheese was a nice touch. This place is a little pricier than most delis, but it was worth it. I was also impressed with their beer selection. Had micros I'd never tried."}
{"text":"How good is it? I came here 3 times in one day.... We stopped in for a bite because I saw it as a new place on yelp. Once we got inside I saw the several tap handles of beer.... Oooo this place is getting even better. The wait staff was very laid back and friendly. I had the Marley Nachos and they were AWESOME!!! So much avocado! After eating I had to run an errand in the same parking lot and it was hot. So on my way back I stopped back in a second time for another beer. While there we Struck up a conversation with the owner. He was a VERY nice guy and treated us like we were long lost friends. So after leaving again we had some friends come to town who were hungry...... BACK TO THE BEACH HUT. They were impressed with the place as well. Great Vibe. I was told they have live music so I will be back to check that out!"}
{"text":"I looked at the menu and in theory this place is great-They serve cool craft beers and they put cream cheese on sandwiches. A bunch of cute women work here. There is plenty of seating. We ordered a couple subs, one being the Santa Cruz. They were huge and condiments were oozing out. But honestly they give you too much. I didn't ask for anything extra either. I'm sure I'd be pumped if I was Wiz Khalifa having the munchies. There was no harmony, just a ton of crazy things that don't belong together. Another disappointment was the quality of the meat. It was noticeably bad. No amount of veggies and condiments can cover up how the meat was. It had hard stringy pieces and was dry. My husband even had different meat and it was still like that. Maybe a simple sandwich with no meat would have been better choice for me."}
{"text":"Came here to watch a finals game and catch up with a friend but i was pleasantly surprised by how good the food was, and how friendly and outgoing the servers were.  im gonna start hanging out here on my laptop on the free wifi"}
{"text":"What's not to like about Beach Hut Deli? Cool beach theme decoration, nice spacious interior and outdoor area, cold beer, delicious food, and large portions. Am I a fan?HELL YEAH!!

You can call them a \"chain\" which is why I usually passed on the lunch invites, but I probably wouldn't now. If you did though think of a Subway or Quiznos but on steroids. I ordered The Pig Kahuna, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/beach-hut-deli-las-vegas?select=rSBykeuQTeYDI_CPbuhaQg#rSBykeuQTeYDI_CPbuhaQg they should call it the Big Kahuna at least that's what I called it when I placed my order.  A pile of pulled pork covered in a sweet, kind of mild BBQ sauce, melted cheddar cheese, and chunks of pineapple in a French roll.  I had the hardest time picking up The Pig Kahuna and taking a bite that I started to use a fork and knife to attack it.  It was delicious and put a smile on my face. They have other healthier sandwiches and other dishes which seemed big also.

They also have daily happy hour specials which run from 3 pm to 6 pm. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/beach-hut-deli-las-vegas?select=rSBykeuQTeYDI_CPbuhaQg#_G9o8Wiph6vpLOdvXc0u2g and the happiest hour 3 pm to 4 pm for $1 pints.  Did I mention that they have a lot of TV? Great place to watch a sporting event."}
{"text":"In a desperate search for a weekend lunch change of pace, we remembered Beach Hut and moseyed over. The restaurant itself is much more substantial than I expected. When I think 
\"sandwich place\", the setup of Subway and Quizno's comes to mind. Beach Hut is an entirely different ballgame. It's big, with tons of seating, both indoor and out. It reminds me a lot of Rubio's in feel. 

The menu is enormous, so I definitely suggest giving it a quick once-over before you go. At first blush, the sandwiches seem a bit pricey (the low end is $7.50 for a small), but, in this glorious case, you totally get what you pay for! They are totally up for customizing your sandwich, which is awesome. You order at the counter, then your food is brought to you at your table. They do have a bar as well. 

The sandwiches were seriously delicious. I had a North Shore and Boyfriend had a Surfin Bird, minus the cheese and bacon. We got them to go and seriously contemplated weighing the to-go bag once we got home. We completely forgot, but I swear, those two sandwiches must have weighed like 3 pounds. So, so worth it. 

The only negative here is the service. They just don't seem to have everything 100% together. From where we were sitting, I could see the sandwich assembly and watched them put ingredients on our sandwiches that we didn't want, then take them off. The sandwiches were then brought to us on trays, even though we had asked for them to-go. They repackaged them in a bag for us, with a bit of an attitude. However, this is one of those rare occasions where the food is good enough to overshadow some sub-par service."}
{"text":"Quiet lil sandwich shop with lots of atmosphere. I tried the meatball sub and it was very good. The size was ridiculous and everything tasted fresh and authentic. About what you'd expect to pay for a full meal, and you'll have plenty left over!"}
{"text":"First time at The Beach Hut Deli, great comfy place to eat. I had the Malibu which was great, nice patio and the beers are frosty...."}
{"text":"My friend Akia treated us to try a new place today! Beach Hut Deli on eastern and man it's awesome!!! Definitely a do over. I had the Malibu today. Pastrami and Monterey Jack with avocados on a toasted garlic cheese bun. So yummy and the Cajun chips were a delightful zesty change of pace."}
{"text":"Boom. 5 Stars.

Better believe that.

5 stars, maybe closer to 6. It was that good. Every part of my experience at Beach Hut Deli was a positive one. From the recommendation the owner gave to the quality of the food, all spot on. It was 7:30pm, about 30 minutes before the Deli was supposed to close and I was treated no differently than as if I was the first customer of the day. The owner recommended  the Surfin Bird for me (Turkey, Avocado, Bacon, Cream Cheese*, Lettuce, Tomato, Mayo). Why the asterisk? Let me tell you why. Because cream cheese on a sammich is one of the greatest things I have ever tasted in the history of my tasting. It was that good. Maybe others already knew this secret, but I didn't. My wife isn't much of a turkeyer, so she took the owners recommendation as he said, and I quote, \"the whole reason I opened this place is because of the Surfin' Cow.\" Cowabunga. Same ingredients as the Surfin Bird, just minus the bird and exchange it for Roast Beef. Served hot or cold, she chose cold. Outstanding! 

The thing I appreciated most was that we were there until a few minutes after 8. Instead of feeling like I needed to rush out (which I probably would have done had I worked there) the owner came up to us and asked how everything was as. He wanted to know how we heard about Beach Hut Deli and  what we thought of the food. He could have easily ignored us and I would have still given this place a 5 star accolades. I appreciated the extra attention and him going out of the way to make us feel warm and welcome.

Well done Beach Hut Deli. See you soon."}
{"text":"I love these sandwiches and so does my husband,  who can be very picky at times. I usually order the Beach Burger which is hot roast beef and so good!"}
{"text":"The place seems nice, and like it might have a good happy hour atmosphere. The sandwiches were alright, although they have a few speciality sandwiches made with cream cheese that just aren't prepared well. I tried taking one bite and this disgusting glob of cream cheese just falls out the back. For a $14 sandwich combo I don't think I should have to come prepared to rearrange and smooth my sandwich to make it edible.

Not bad, but with so many options around I highly doubt we would ever come back or recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Food is awesome. More then plenty of food for the price. Real food not processed junk. Great atmosphere.  Laid back and fun. The staff was great.  Very friendly. And there is beer. Sunday is game day with tons going on. Beer pong, corn hole toss, darts, and golden tee. It's a local favorite for sure."}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are awesome!  Steve is a really nice guy - took time to talk with our family. We will definitely be going back. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Catching title and decor in the middle of a desert. Beach Hut Deli has a great outdoor patio with plenty of shade to escape the Nevada heat. The menu is comprised of great beach theme sandwich, burger and salad options. The price is average for a sandwich shop around $11 for a sandwich and a drink. I ordered the new item hightide, it comes with chopped pastrami, ham, crumbled bacon, mild cheddar, Pepperjack on a cheese garlic toast... Oh yeah it is warm and toasted. 

If you are looking for an alternative to the chain sandwich shops give it a try."}
{"text":"Awesome sandwich nice environment couldn't ask for more. Staff was wonderful will be back to this place!"}
{"text":"I had the Surfin Bird. The quality of the Turkey sucked for me, especially for the price.  I loved the lettuce that is shredded very fine, yum.  It smells so good when you walk the door.    It got my taste buds going!
Reading the other reviews has brought me to the conclusion there are certain sandwiches there that are VERY delicious and some just so so.  I was not too impressed,  but  I am willing go back and try a different sandwich.  I don't recommend the Surfin Bird.  Also, they should hollow out the bread a bit because everything squishes out the sides."}
{"text":"This is the most grubbin' sandwich shop in the city! The RIGHTEOUS REUBEN was like a flavor punch in the mouth. 
I can't wait to go try their bottomless mimosas next Sunday! 
I'm a dedicated Beach Hut Deli lover"}
{"text":"I really dig this place. The menu is great, lots of creative sandwich options. The interior is great and the covered patio is solid too. Like that they have sports on and serve beers too. Hidden gem!"}
{"text":"I love this place, and I LOVE that they offer delish gluten free bread! There are not a lot of options in town for gluten free, when it comes to sandwich shops, so I am very grateful! They load their sandwiches up and do not skimp on any ingredients!!! The vibe is chill and laid back, you can catch some beach tunes and Bob Marley while you enjoy your yummy lunch or breakfast! Sunday brunch even has an option for bottomless mimosas $15 from 10-1, in 8 plus flavors!!!! The staff is always helpful and super sweet! Thanks Beach Hut Deli for amazing gluten free options!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place! Everything from their laid back chill atmosphere and super friendly employees to their amazing food screams perfection! 

This is definitely going to be my goto hang out lunch spot! I can grab a quick bite to eat or hang out by the patio and have a few beers or mimosas with friends. It's perfect for all! 

They have an amazing variety of sandwiches and their proportions are out of this world! You def get the most bang for your buck at this little Henderson Jem!"}
{"text":"LOVE BEACH HUT!!!!! The Santa Cruz and the Malibu are my favorites, both great pastrami sandwiches. They've got great microbrews on tap for really cheap ($7 for a liter of microbrew is a steal!!!). Great friendly, laid back atmosphere. Steven and Courtney are great hosts."}
{"text":"After multiple visits here, I felt inclined to bump it up to 5 stars! Always consistently great subs! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Ahhhhh-mazing this place is a relaxing, chill atmosphere, with a great fresh take on a sandwich, truly feels like a beach shack escape, and the people are service-oriented and fun. 

So glad we found this little piece of sandwich heaven! And it's right here in our backyard!"}
{"text":"I'm still dreaming about Sunday bottomless mimosas. Sadly, we were on our way to deliver a wedding cake so we didn't have time to enjoy them. Next time!

I wanted to try something new but I just kept thinking about the pastrami melt with avocado. It's on garlic bread and the bread actually has real chunks of roasted garlic. Delish!  They are super super generous with their avocado portions, which I love. I had my 22 month old daughter with me, so I took half the avocado off for her snack and it as still enough. 

Hubby got the pig (?) not sure on name. He said it was so yummy. I would've tried it but I'm a weirdo that always goes no mayo, no mustard, no sour cream, no white creamy sauce etc. I wanted to try it though but he loves mayo. 

Funny story, my previous review was very good (4 stars) but I did mention they forgot to put chips in the to go bag. The girl at the counter must've seen my pic or remembered us (our kid is pretty cute, ha!!) and took care of our chips this time. A little embarrassing, but I so do appreciate the attention to detail in yelp reviews, as I'm the same was a a biz owner. 

Side note, we live in Mountain's Edge, so we actually travel all the way here. Will be back for those darn mimosas!  One Sunday soon!

{"text":"Beachy keen... well sort of. 

From the reviews I've read and the posted photos of this place my hopes were high. But after biting into \"Drakester\" and half of it spitting out the back of it, I knew this would be a tough sell. 

I walked in and was greeted immediately, with smiles and info. I had arrived during happy hour which means $2 beers after you roll some dice, the number rolled corresponds to what type of beer you get. If you get a beer you don't like, you can pay an extra dollar and get the beer you want, $3 total. Not a bad deal and pretty fun. Happy Hour is only during the week from 3pm -6pm. 

I ordered the \"Drakester\" sandwich, which is a hot turkey sandwich with melted pepper jack, cream cheese, roasted chili peppers, lite mayo, on toasted garlic sourdough cheese bread. I ordered this with no mayo, but it was still disappointing. The ingredients were fresh and there were plenty of them, but the whole thing fell apart after the first bite. There was way too much cream cheese on this sandwich and I couldn't really taste any garlic on the bread. This was more of a stoner creation a than restaurant quality sandwich. Pretty disappointing 

My foodie partner in crime ordered the, \"Shark Bite\". this sandwich was very good, compared to the Drakester. It came with canadian ham, swiss cheese, cream cheese, tabasco, BBQ sauce, onions, bacon, lettuce and mayo garlic cheese sourdough bread. After having a bite of this I started to have buyers remorse with my sandwich and convinced my foodie friend to trade halfs. Sucker!

The one thing this place does deliver on is beer. They have a great selection of brews from Stone, Lost Coast, and most recently Rogue Hazelnut Brown - pure goodness. 

Beyond the sudsy love, my experience at Beach Hut was pretty lackluster, but the \"Shark Bite\" boosted my faith in this deli and I will be back for another and hopefully to update my review for the positive."}
{"text":"Quick Look: 3 Stars for this first visit. Mixed thoughts but it certainly showed some promise. 

In Depth Review: Live right down the road from this gourmet sandwich shop and deli and never even noticed it. Was going to eat at another location in this strip mall and decided to try this location instead. Walked in at about 2pm on a Thursday and nobody was inside eating or in line ordering food. Was this a sign? Girl at the counter seemed a little unenthusiastic and didn't exactly greet us properly or make any suggestions as we stood there lost and starring at the massive menu on the wall. 

The decor is pretty cool and it looks straight out of a So Cal beach town like Hermosa Beach or Pacific Beach. Really liked the decor and the laid back chill music & beach vibe. Place is much larger than it looks outside and has a great outside patio area that would be ideal if it was not so hot. 

I ordered a hot (melted) sandwich called the \"Drakester\" and the lady ordered a cold  sandwich called the \"Beach Bikini.\" We also ordered a side of potato salad and shared a coke. The food comes out in a Frisbee (love it). The sandwiches cost anywhere between $7 - $12 each. They are not massive sandwiches in size and are a bit high on the price spectrum for this neighborhood IMO. The Drakester was interesting. It consisted of hot turkey, melted pepper jack cheese, a giant slab of cream cheese, mayo and roasted chili peppers on sourdough bread. Didn't look enticing at first. Was messy, required two hands to eat as it wanted to slide in two different directions. But this sandwich tasted pretty damn good! It was a pleasant surprise. Not the healthiest choice, but a delicious choice. The lady enjoyed her sandwich but thought it was just OK at best.  The homemade potato salad was served German style and tasted good to me. The lady thought it had too much mayo. Oh well, cannot please everyone. I approve of it and liked it. 

In Summery: The Beach Hut Deli has potential and I think I will give them an honest second look. As a marketing guy I would advise the owners and management to step up their promotions and advertising. Especially in the near-by neighborhoods. Was there 45+ minutes and only saw one other guy walk in to get a sandwich. Pretty sure he worked at a business in the strip mall. This is a neat spot and would like to see it stick around for a while. Or long enough for that second visit."}
{"text":"I love this place for sandwiches. The bread is always perfect, and the meat is thick and not the crappy meat you get at any other sandwich place. There bacon is fully cooked REAL bacon and its actually thick, the condiments on the sandwiches always taste fresh and they are perfectly placed in the sandwich every time. They have a huge variety of tasty subs and I have never been disappointed in picking a new sub for the day. By far out of every sandwich place I have been to this place knocks the rest out of the water. 
The Staff is also very friendly and my order is always correct. Only reason They did not get the fifth star is because they are a little on the pricy side probably because of the value of the product which is ok in my book."}
{"text":"This place has a cool casual decor with surfboards as your table and a nice outdoor area with live music weekly. They let you sample their beers and don't mind custom orders. I come here monthly to watch the game with my friends and to get quality food. I'm not a vegetarian but I recommend the California. They put a whole avocado on there to substitute for the protein. If I were them I'd charge a buck or two more because it's that good haha"}
{"text":"Well I was there last Sunday and waited almost 20 minutes for two sandwiches.  The roast beef was acceptable but the turkey was low grade.  If they are charging 10 bucks for a sandwich it better have fresh carved meat not something I can buy in a pre-wrapped package at the supermarket.  I think this place can be great but they need to fix their speed and quality of meats.  I will likely go elsewhere next time unless they improve."}
{"text":"Soooooooo slow. There's no one here and it's already been 15 minutes of waiting for my food and it's no where in site. $30 for 2 sandwiches chips and drinks is absolutely rediculous to start with. I havent even gotten my food and I hate this place and will never come back here. I don't understand what all the great reviews are for this place is a waste. Yet another shit place that las vegans rant about, because they have no idea what decent food is, even if it is just a sandwich."}
{"text":"Never a bad sandwich here! 

The service is always friendly and attentive. The decor is adorable. The skinny dipper is what I always come in for! Try it, you will not regret it! 

and it's in the same center as nielsens!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Huge outdoor patio with lights and games. Great sandwiches with beer on tap. Very dog friendly!"}
{"text":"The 3 stars are strictly for the atmosphere! Love the surf board tables, the frisbee plates & the Bob Marley music! However...I didn't go for all that. Went for a simple pastrami sandwich & I left sleepy & hungry. Sleepy...I know you're wondering! Well, I had to wait at least 30 minutes to get my sandwich...and it was not the least bit crowded in there. Hungry...I know you're wondering about that too! Well, it was nasty. Too much hype. Should have gone to BJs as planned."}
{"text":"Amazing! For us native Las Vegas folks, We are blessed that California has finally shared this gem of a sandwich shop. Sandwiches are huge!!! I'll give you a little background on me: I love Philly cheesesteak sandwiches. In fact, I order them just about everywhere I go, and have even eaten them in Philadelphia. I walked into Beach Hut Deli at the recommendation of my little brother, and didn't know what to expect. I immediately was drawn to the cheesesteak sandwich. So I went on ahead and ordered the medium variant of it. After ordering a medium fountain drink, something caught my eye. It was a Sierra Nevada beer tap!!! The gentleman making the food (who I later found out was the manager/owner) asked if I wanted a tall, to which I stated \"definitely\". He gave me a huge pint of Sierra Nevada Ale for no additional charge than that of the soda. What a cool guy. Minuets later a monster sandwich was presented to me. It was probably 8\" long and was over-flowing with tender/juicy steak, cheese, and surprisingly; cream cheese (which was awesome!). I'm not a huge fan of cream cheese at all, but this just WORKED. What a pleasant experience, though I'd share. I live in the area, and this place is my new favorite sandwich shop. I still enjoy firehouse, San Francisco sourdough eatery, and jimmy johns. But this place just stands out, for it's monster sandwiches and delicious beer on tap. DO IT!"}
{"text":"There's really nothing to say about this place other than HOLY SHIT!
Honestly, I've been to a ton of sandwich shops in town, but this place is miles ahead of the competition in both price and quality. OH and did I mention, there's freakin' beer here on tap? That's right, enjoy the Valley's best sandwich along with a brewskie? 'Hello God, are you there? It's me Margaret' status up in this joint. 

Happy hour is from 3-7 and has some INSANE deals. Don't pass this baby up."}
{"text":"Very beach-y! Just missing the sand! There are surfboard tables inside and a nice outdoor seating area. Sunday is game day and there's a large viewing sofa to watch one of the six TV screens around the room. There's quite a varied sandwich menu. We had The Malibu. It has hot pastrami and swiss cheese on a delicious garlic cheese bread with mayo and avocado. They obliged me by putting the avocado on the side. My only complaint was that they marinated the pastrami in Italian dressing and it was a bit too vinegary. Next time, I'd ask them to skip the dressing. We will come back--so many more sandwiches to try!"}
{"text":"Another lunch spot diamond. This place has really good sandwiches. Even the hot dogs are great here. If they could get the license to open a full size bar this could be a happening spot. I have only been here for lunch and would love to come for dinner with drinks. The servers are really pretty and nice. The flavors are well blended. If you get the cream-cheese spread they put on the sandwiches, it can be overwhelming so ask for it light and you should be good."}
{"text":"My husband and I use to make beach hut our first stop when we went to Sacramento to visit  . So amazing that this is right down the street from us now. I meant to yelp awhile ago love this place and the service is always friendly."}
{"text":"I love this place. I go to school a few doors down at Paul Mitchell and this is going to be my new favorite place for lunch. It is a bit overpriced for a sandwich however a small is practically big enough to feed a family ( ok realistically myself and a friend) . The sandwiches have small unique twist like adding cream cheese were you would never think to put it and all the ingredients looked really fresh. Last but not least I really think this may be a cool place to sit back and have a beer with friends and grub on a sammy... why? because they are a sandwich place that sells beer."}
{"text":"Again an excellent perfect chef salad with the best bacon I ever ate. Ingredients are high quality and very fresh and the salad is portioned correctly.  It is exactly how it is pictured on their website.  I love the fact they give you a choice of lettuce, romaine or spinach as the base for your salad. I chose lettuce and it was fresh and crisp."}
{"text":"I had a medium two meat/two cheese. Lots of meat. The sandwich was good, nothing outstanding though. The bread was average. For the sandwich and a drink was almost $17.00, no side included."}
{"text":"My honey and I tried this place for the first time today and I must say I was so amazed!
Food was so very good and the service is great! Clean and friendly people and so nice on the patio"}
{"text":"4 stars for the food, 1 star for the service. After waiting for 10 min while a cashiers just gabbed away at the other end, one of the nice staff members making the food stopped, removed their gloves and took my order."}
{"text":"Food was delicious
I love the atmosphere
I could do with out the girls wearing bikinis though, I just felt sorry for them. 
The service was a bit slow

All in all I would recommend to my friends."}
{"text":"I'm a meat eater through and through, so why would I find myself craving a vegetarian sandwich ? The \"California\" at Beach Hut Deli is amazing. Loaded up with Avocado and Alfalfa sprouts, full of flavor and freshness. Sandwiches are HUGE, ingredients fresh. The Marley Nachos are great and remind me of BLT flavors in a good way.
The only caveat would be that their \"assembly line\" could be optimized a bit better to cut down on waiting time if it's busy."}
{"text":"This place is sooo good! My boyfriend ordered the hobie and I ordered the surfing pig! They were both sooo good! The small sandwich was big enough to fill me up! Yes it might be pricier than subway, but you can taste the difference. The only thing I did not like was the potato salad; it wasn't horrible, but I was different. The girls working were very sweet, the atmosphere was good and the food was great! I definitely will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Big sandwiches in a game filled atmosphere.

If you like BIG sandwiches, you should definitely go here. Your sandwich comes on top of a monster sub bun with a pile of meat and any toppings that go with your sandwich. I got the Santa Cruz because it had pastrami, the most sensual of all the salted cured meats, and that was a damn good sandwich. It's topped with avocados and a bunch of other toppings, so if you are more of just a meat and cheese type person, you could just go for their plain pastrami sandwich, which I imagine is also just a mound of delicious pastrami.

The thing you need to know before ordering here is the sizes of the sandwiches. They have small, medium, and large sizes, but their \"smalls\" are actually normal sized sandwiches, the mediums are large, and a \"large\" is probably a sandwich that could feed the team of monstars. I got the medium, and finished it, though I would have been plenty satisfied with only eating half of the medium sandwich.

If you aren't eating, there is plenty else to do. They have a Wii on one of their TVs to pass the time, some beer pong tables, and a bags setup, making it look like a really fun place to hang out."}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are amazing. I can't believe it's taken me this long to write a review. I thought I had written one a long time ago. I sing their praises constantly. My favorite sandwich is the Malibu. Hot pastrami on garlic cheese bread... are you kidding me? As if that wasn't good enough it also has avocado.... I mean seriously - this is my dream sandwich. The boyfriend likes the Surfin Cow or pig or the Santa Cruz. But he's always conflicted about trying a new sandwich. The main problem being that there are too many good choices to choose from... a great problem to have. 

The place is pretty cute inside and the staff is always super friendly. I've been here several times and always receive the same great service. Parking can be a little rough if it's a busy night for one of the other restaurants in the center, so be mindful of that."}
{"text":"I have been by this place so many times and never had the chance to come and try their food until now. I ordered the Northshore which is one of the best sandwiches I've had in a long time. It's got just the right amount of flavor and I ordered it with light dressing since I'm not a big fan of Italian dressing. Avocado and pastrami pair so well. The young girl that took my order was so sweet, I asked her about the grapefruit beer and she said she was only 17 so she couldn't tell me :) What a doll.. will def be back to try some of their other sandwiches :) Cute setup/decor and loved the music they played."}
{"text":"The employees are always so nice and just cool. And the sandwiches are great! Just an awesome place. And probably the only sandwich place where you can have a beer too. They usually have some kind of beer deal going on, which is great."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times now. It seems to be the sandwich spot we take people to when they want a yummy filling sandwich to eat. I love sandwiches and this spot is great. It has the things I love in most of the selections. Cream cheese and avocado! It's a big sandwich and stuffed with a lot of meat. The surfin bird is my favorite! My bfs favorite is the Pig Kahuna. Both are delicious. It is so filling! It's a bit on the pricey side but it is worth to get SO MUCH."}
{"text":"We had lunch on the patio with our pugs! The food was good and beer was cold. The service was great.  Can not wait to go back and try more."}
{"text":"I went to this place the other day. I have really nothing bad to say except the menu is posted on two walls a little confusing... But the atmosphere outside patio is so cute!!! Really cool for a deli/rest never been to one like that. The menu was good and I had a BBQ salad seemed pretty healthy :)"}
{"text":"I was really impressed with this place when I first walked in the door. This changed really fast after placing my order.
First; $21 for two small sandwiches and two sodas. WAY OVERPRICED!
Second, the cool surf board table were inviting but the table were dirty and covered in trash and red baskets so we didn't get to sit at one. 
Third, these were two of the sloppiest sandwiches I have ever seen. My sandwich fell apart as soon as I picked it up. The bacon was as hard as a rock. It actually hurt my teeth to crunch it. The cream cheese that came in the sandwich was hard and clumpy, not spread like it should have been. I'm sure the sandwich would have tasted better had it not been for the burnt bacon and the frozen cream cheese.
My last, and biggest problem was the lack of professionalism from the employees. I only saw one girl working. The others were standing around, goofing off. Three of the girls were drinking a beer at the bar.
I'm not interested in eating at a restaurant where the employees don't care about their customers.
I will not return to this establishment. Too bad, because it looks really cool and has tons of potential."}
{"text":"I found my newest addiction this week. Beach Hut Deli! Originally I was going to eat at the Spicy Pickle down the street but found out it was closed. I pulled up good ole yelp on my phone and started to look for something nearby. All I had to do was look at the pictures of the sandwiches to know I wanted to eat at Beach Hut Deli.  

Upon walking in I felt like I was at the beach and that was cool by me. There were surfboards decorated on the walls and even some of the tabletops were shaped like a surfboard. The menu is on the wall and I had a hard time deciding what I wanted to try. I ordered a small \"Santa Cruz\" priced at $8.25 and it had pastrami, avocado, bacon and cream cheese. I got it with everything so it also included mayo, mustard, pickle, tomato, onion, greek peppers and cheese. This sandwich was SO good! I had to get a fork because the insides were just falling out. They didn't skimp on the sandwich at all. I will order this again without a doubt. Hubby ordered a large \"Pastrami Sandwich\" priced at $12.95 and it just had pastrami, cheese and mustard. He loved it! They have bottled soda or for $2 you can get a cup for the fountain machine that gives you unlimited refills for that visit. Honestly you could easily share a sandwich with someone too they look small in some of the pictures but I assure you they are chocked full. The food was delivered on a frisbee for a plate!

They have a patio area and a happy hour menu Mon-Fri. The sign inside said they currently offer happy hour all day long on Sundays. They have plenty of tv's on the walls too. They also offer catering and party trays or boxed lunches. If you haven't tried Beach Hut Deli yet and love GOOD sandwiches then stop by!"}
{"text":"We were craving yummy sandwiches and beach hut deli satisfied! 

We got the Santa Cruz - pastrami,avocado, bacon, cream cheese (in addition to their standard toppings of mayo, dill pickles, tomatoes, red onions, lettuce, Greek peppers, and cheese) - the pastrami was warm and tender and the sandwich was great. 

Also got the Haole cheese steak - hot roast beef, Monterey jack, cream cheese, onions and peppers with a special spicy marinade on a toasted roll. - so awesome. The meat marinade had a peppery flavor and was super tender, the cream cheese and toastedness just brought it all together. 

Definitely will be back here for more!

The sandwiches can be huge so keep that in mind when ordering."}
{"text":"Boyfriend brought me here INCREDIBLE I appreciate that they had our food waiting for us although it was maybe 5-10 to closing. Super nice staff!!"}
{"text":"Outside seating is not what it's cracked up to be!!!
Allows people to smoke while sitting outside!!!
Apparently they don't care!!
Just have to report to the better business bureau. 
Will never eat here again!!!!"}
{"text":"The changes that have been made are going to cause this place to close for good. After the salads we had tonight I'd be ashamed and just lock it up and don't come back. I'll spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"I am not a sandwich person but this place is slowly converting me.

Pros:
-nice customer service
-relaxing atmosphere
-yummy sandwich
-variety of choices

Cons
-a little steep on the prices
-sandwich takes a while to be made even if they are not busy

Overall,I will come back from time to time. It's a spot where you'd have to splurge for food. As a side note, my personal favorite is the skinny dipper! I still have couple of sandwiches to try here as well as mimosas!"}
{"text":"This place is really good has a great selection of Sandwiches.  We had 3 different Sandwiches and they were all good. Great customer service and cool Beach atmosphere. The 3 Sandwiches we had were the Surfin Bird, the beach meatball, and the Spicolli all Delicious."}
{"text":"The best sandwich shop in Las Vegas! Yes, better than Capriottis! Incredibly fresh ingredients, fresh sliced meats piled high, soft bread that has flavor, avocado fresh out of the skin, fresh veggies, different cheeses that aren't cut into triangles, and a large menu full of unique choices including the PIG Kahuna, the Beach Bikini and the Surfin Bird. The last time I was there I ordered a simple vegetarian sandwich and had them toast the bread and cheese for me before the other toppings went on and it was killer. The sandwiches are huge, they sell beer including some on tap and have couches for watching football! A great place to grab lunch and watch a game. The staff was friendly and the sandwiches came out fast.  I have been several times and am never disappointed. Go check them out!"}
{"text":"Being greeted with a hello and a smile is usually a great way to start off. I had high hopes for this place prior to ever arriving based on the previous YELP reviews that I had read and the pictures that were posted. When I entered the door I knew that YELP had set me up for success yet again. This place smells like the inside of a jar of molasses. The setup is really unique and welcoming. They have covered outdoor sitting (covered being the key word), and lots of space on the inside to dine. 

Heres how my encounter went at the Beach Hut. I entered and showed the nice gentleman at the register a yelp photo and said what is this... AHHH the Big Kahuna he explained. Our pulled pork sandwich with chopped pineapples,BBQ sauce, and just enough spice. 

Solid ill take it... oh yeah and add some of those nachos in the picture. (Caution yelpers don't make the same rookie mistake I made and allow your eyes to order a meal that your belly can't sustain)

First came \"The Big Kahuna\" which ...dare I say it, is the best sandwhich I have ever eaten. It has just enough spice to compliment the pineapple and sweet barbecue sauce. The bread was soft and fluffy like eating a cloud of perfectly melted flavors. Next, out came the Marley Nachos. The combination of the bacon, feahly melted cheese and avocado puts the Marley nachos into a league of their own. These things are better then good, great is an understatement, I would classify this plate of chips and cheese as a brilliantly crafted, eclectic, pieces of edible art. I ate the entire sandwich and most of the nachos and yes I feel disgustingly full, but man was it worth it. The young lady in the hut said that was the first time she had witnessed anyone order both(allllrightttt). Let this be a lesson to you all when other yelpers warn that the portion sizes are huge, they mean it. 

I don't mean to sound all dramatic and stuff but this is the best new spot in town. Thank goodness its on eastern and not the strip.

P.S. they serve all of their dishes on frisbees, if you bring your little ones in they let them keep the frisbee."}
{"text":"The staff here are some of the nicest I have encountered in all of Vegas. They all seem to enjoy being here and welcome you to stop in for their open mic night on the weekends. This place has a great vibe to it, the music is turned up and the screens all have something worth watching. Really relaxing and welcoming. The food definitely did not disappoint. I had the Pig Kahuna and it was massive. I wished I would of ordered something with some veggies in it but to be honest I enjoyed piggin out. Definitely give this place a shot. 

Great atmosphere, great and friendly service, delicious & well priced food. 5 Stars for sure."}
{"text":"This is a great sand which shop with some good hot sandwiches. It wasn't very busy, but I could see it being a fun atmosphere of it had some more life there. Outside seating is a plus. A little pricey for what you get, but not too bad. Sand which was really good!"}
{"text":"The food quality here is on point! The portions are HUGE, and you do get your money's worth. I ordered a small size Pig Kahuna sandwich. It sure was a Kahuna because for a small portion it was huge! Mmmmhmmm....I love me some pulled pork. The sandwich was just FULL of flavor and the pinapple toppings went well with the sandwich. There was so much juice and fillings on the sandwich that I even ate it with a fork. So, if you're down to get al ittle messy. Eat it by hand. If not, I'd reccommend using a fork to defeat the Kahuna.

We also ordered the Surfin' Cow. This was also a great choice. Cream cheese? What a twist to a sandwich. They also added what seemed like a full avocado on there. Who doesn't love avocado. This was also full of flavor and the roast beef was nice and tender.

The service was a-ok. The girls were still getting the jist of everything so the service just needs a little work. The only thing I didn't appreciate was the cashier saying, \"Now what?\" I don't know about you, but never have I ever gone to an establishment where a server or cashier spoke to me that way, nor do I ever go to a place expecting someone to speak to me that way. Our order took a little longer than normal to come, but the gentleman who worked there was nice enough to offer us complementary drinks and chips for the wait. So I thought it was nice of him to reach out.

Theo ther cool thing is is they also have a bar with a wonderful selection of beer I think there was IPA, Shock Top, and some more I couldn't remember. The establishment is very clean and well decorated. It's a very fun and hip place, with a college hang out feel to it. They also provide flat screens for people to enjoy watching that big game!"}
{"text":"I had the Santa Cruz Pastrami sandwich. It was a different spin on a Pastrami sandwich,  but delicious and very flavorful. Sarah was a very gracious order taker, cashier, and hostess. I can't wait to go back and try the cheesesteak sandwich."}
{"text":"Went back in today had a much much better experience with the staff wasn't so lame this time lol food was good good atmosphere will start coming back more often"}
{"text":"Sandwiches that give Capriotti's a run for its money in portion size and flavor.  Good service and decor plus having beers on tap is great.  The early closing times are a major let down.  It's like riding the bonzai pipeline only for your friend to knock the board out from under you."}
{"text":"This place was awesome!
Me and my boyfriend came here last night to get a sandwich for dinner. 
We had never been before but it looked good on yelp so we decided to try it out.
First off: the service was great! We arrived at 645 (we didn't know they closed at 7) and they were still totally nice, and just said they were gonna be cleaning up but we could sit ant make ourselves comfortable for a while. All the people were super nice and friendly!
Now the food: I got the pig kahuna and my bf got the bbq chicken, both were delicious! The sandwiches were also HUGE, I swear the thing weighed like 5lbs! Lol the meat was really good, and the bread was so nice and fluffy on the inside, and  lightly toasted on the outside. Of course I inhaled the whole thing, and it was great. 
Overall I'd give this place 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Hands down VERY BEST sandwich shop in Henderson and Vegas that I have ever been to (20 year resident). Food is awesome, fresh, BIG, not expensive. Employees are the best. Nice happy hour. Good music (live bands sometimes). Very friendly atmosphere. Eco-conscious practices! Cups are made of a bio-plastic that uses sugars from corn and food-waste instead of oil! 60% reduction in carbon footprint AND they can go in a landfill and biodegrade. Owner Steve is simply awesome. Say hi to him, he's usually there. Olivia and Psalm working this night. Friendly and cool as usual! Thanks ladies! Free super fast wi-fi, so nice place to sit and work for awhile. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I've been to Beach Hut Deli many times over the years and was surprised that I had never reviewed it.  The vibe is laid back & chill, the staff have always been friendly; and the food fresh and satisfying.  You're greeted with reggae or island tunes, which always puts me in a better mood.  Inside, there are numerous TV's, seating at booths with surf board shaped tables, a large sofa, a small bar area, and there are more tables on the patio.

On this trip we shared the 6\" Surfin' Cow sandwich (roast beef, really crispy bacon, cream cheese, mayo, mustard, pickles, tomatoes, sprouts, lettuce, peppers) and the 1/2 size of the Chef Salad (Chopped ham, turkey, salami, cheddar, jack cheese, tomatoes, more yummy bacon, peppers, and sliced avocado).  

I never thought I would like cream cheese on a sandwich, but it adds a creamy texture and a great flavor profile to their sandwiches.  The small 6\" size may seem inadequate to fill some people up, but trust me, their sandwiches are packed.  They don't skimp here.

The salad was also very good and on the 1/2 size the amount of toppings actually eclipses the amount of lettuce.  If you like a chef salad, you'll enjoy this one.  

This sandwich shop will definitely stay in the rotation!"}
{"text":"Mediocre. Food was ok. Service fine. Decor was whatever. What is beach hut cuisine? Is that even a thing? What happened to pizza joints and sausage carts?"}
{"text":"Just ok. Very pricy for what you get. $11 for a small sandwich and a drink? Sandwich was way overloaded with mustard, couldn't taste much else."}
{"text":"Would have loved to try one of their sandwiches but after waiting over 25 min (no joke) we asked for a refund. No one behind the counter seemed to know what was going on. They werent that busy when we got there but they kept giving out other peoples sandwiches. After i complained for waiting to long they I heard the guy get mad cause she gave my sandwich away. There was a guy that ordered before us that waited 45 min and they did the same thing to him after he complained. Three of us ended up asking for a refund and ended up leaving hungry. I have never been to a sandwich shop so disorganized. Will not be returning since I had to return to work late with no sandwich"}
{"text":"This place is great! Reminds me of being back in Florida have a great sandwich on the beach. Everything sounds great on the menu but I can't stop ordering the Hobie. 
Great vibe, great outdoor seating and great staff too."}
{"text":"Deli with a burger atmosphere, if that makes any sense.  Located in the heart of what I call \"Restaurant Row\" on Eastern Ave.  This places doesn't disappoint.  I was very satisfied to say the least. Originally was going to get some grub at BJ's, which is located in the same parking lot.  But a co-worker suggested this place and swears by it. 

The first thing I noticed when I walked in was the decor. Kind of cheesy with the \"try hard\" beach theme.  Almost reminded me of someone having a beach theme house party. The second thing I noticed was the huge menu on the wall and multiple flat panel TV's. 

Staff was great and if you don't know what to get, they'll suggest something for you. Just let them know it's your first time. 

I got the Drakster, which is basically a Turkey Melt.  But there was nothing basic about this sandwich. About 10 oz of sliced turkey and melted cheese all in a grilled piece of bread.  Sandwich was huge and worth the $10.  I'm a dipper and had to cut the sandwich in a couple of pieces just so I can dip it.  Your sandwich is also brought to your table in a frisbee used as a plate.  I actually thought the frisbee was a giveaway just like those old school happy meals.  You know, the meals that came inside those plastic boats.  Who doesn't remember that.  Back to the sandwich, the best. 

My only issue is that the booths are a bit tight.  Your table is a surf board, which is small for a table top.  You'll find yourself bumping knees with whoever you're eating with.  Might be a good thing depending who your company is. 

TIP 1:  It's probably a crime to add any condiments since the sandwiches are good as is.  But if you need any, ask them in advance.  That goes for any silverware too.  This place doesn't have a separate place for this. 

TIP 2:  Portions are big.  Yes, this place doesn't skimp.  Order a regular if you're use to a foot long Subway Sandwhich.  If you're a hungry man like me, order their large.

TIP 3:  Open mic on the weekends??  Friend suggested I come back on the weekends to do my best American Idol impression.  Yeah right, but will come back to enjoy.

Definitely will be back.  I'm in this area a lot and can't wait to try different sandwich."}
{"text":"Removing  2 stars. came in for my delicious surfin bird that I loved. The blonde girl at the register shouldn't be at a register. Not only did I have to repeat my order 3 different times, it's still not right. Also, you cant not put bacon on a sandwich that comes with bacon especially at that price. Sure the sandwich is good, but not a surfin bird without without the bacon. Sad that next time will have to check the sandwiches and unwrap them next time I come in before I can leave. Makes the takeout process longer when the point of take out is to be quick. Disappointed"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best sandwiches I've had. Very friendly staff, clean restaurant. On top of the great food, where else can you enjoy $2 happy hour pints?!?"}
{"text":"Wow! I rarely eat sandwiches, due to gluten sensitivity, so it has to be amazing for me to eat. If I told you I went back 3 days in a row, would that be a good validation? On top of that, I don't eat roast beef, and the Woody, which is warm roast beef, barbecue sauce, cheddar cheese, onions, lettuce, bacon and cream cheese; makes this place very special. I've tried a few different sandwiches and all are great, but the Woody is what has kept me coming back so far. Tiff, the manager is super cool too! Go say hi! I can't wait to try all of their other tasty treats!!!"}
{"text":"I had the medium Santa Cruz today and I must say it was awesome.  It also filled me up all day and wasn't even hungry for dinner.  They have an excellent selection of quality beers and i definitely will be hitting up their happy hour for some great deals."}
{"text":"We were in the area and getting hungry. My husband asked 'Are there any places nearby that you have bookmarked on Yelp?' I pulled up this place, and after viewing photos of their sandwiches, the decision was made.

We decided to split the Malibu. Hot pastrami and melted Swiss on toasted garlic cheese bread, mayo, Italian dressing and avocado. This sandwich was excellent. The pastrami was so flavorful, and they did not skimp on the avocado at all. We were still taking about this sandwich the next day. 

The shop is very inviting. Really cute with its surf board tables and beach theme. There were booths, some comfy arm chairs and outdoor seating. Plenty of tvs around the entire place, each on a different sports channel. What was cute was that our sandwich was served on a frisbee. Great touch."}
{"text":"I've come here two days in a row now for lunch......so I guess that means I love it?
When you are big fat preggo lady, you need to stay away from lunch meats. However, I figured its heated pretty thoroughly it should kill any lurking bacteria. Yesterday I had ordered the Woody. I thought it was pretty delish, but the Tabasco gave me heartburn (thank you pregnancy again). My husband tried the other half and he thought it was WONDERFUL! He said he would make the drive to Henderson to get a fresh one himself. 

Today I went back for lunch since I am lazy and it was a short walk from my office. I decided on the skinny dipper. It is pretty tasty and no heartburn this time! People say its a bit pricey, but I've never seen so much meat on a sandwich before. It's definitely filling and worth the price. The bread is never soggy even though its heated! Definitely a winner!

I definitely will be back and this place will be in my weekly rotation for lunch!"}
{"text":"When I discovered this place, I knew I could no longer eat at the sandwhich chain that promotes healthy eating and weight loss. There's nothing healthy about having a sandwhich that has a huge chunk of cream cheese and regular cheese and mayo...and I freaking love it!!! My taste buds are happy little campers every time I leave this place.
My two favorites are the surfin' cow and Santa Cruz. Each sandwhich is packed full of meat and veggies, like freaking huge. I always have them add sprouts to the sandwhich, it gives it that extra kick for me. I always get the sandwhiches toasted. Super yummy, especially with the cream cheese.

My only bad experience was when they accidentally left the bacon out of my sandwhich. Instead of bringing the bacon on a small plate or a napkin, the guy just came over to my table and handed it to me with his bare hands. Ummm, can you say gross? I just didn't eat it. But I love this place and I will be back:)"}
{"text":"Had lunch with my wife and we split the bbq chicken and a few beers from their tap. Plenty of choices and still our go to place for a really good sandwich!!!! Easy to get to location on Eastern."}
{"text":"I was recommended to this place by a friend, and wow I was pleasantly surprised. My fiancée loves sandwiches and I'm a pretty big fan of them myself. Having been burnt out on the traditional ham-cheese-mayo-turkey and vegetables that you find in most sandwich restaurants, I was pleasantly surprised to find this shop/lounge was nothing of the sort. All of their menu items are brilliantly described and the taste is even better. Loaded to the brim with all of the fixings and a wide assortment of condiments and ingredients that are not considered standard by most means, ie cream cheese. 

The price is a little on the steep side when you're considering you're paying for just a sandwich, but this is about as gourmet of a sandwich as you can get without it really being a gourmet sandwich. These guys make big, tasty, attractive sandwiches. Try it, I doubt you'll be disappointed.

Not to mention this place doubles as a bar/lounge area, with plenty of TV's so swing by on a Sunday and watch some football while you chow. Yes, that means beer too for you calorie lovers.

As for me, I'll be coming back fa-sho!"}
{"text":"Checked this place out today, man, it was good! I wish there was one of these on the west side of town. The next time I'm in that area, BAM! I'm there again for sure! Had the Shark Bite; perfect sandwich! Love the atmosphere as well! It's a beach atmosphere with the reggae music playing. Really makes you feel like you're on vacation!"}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches and a friendly staff.  These are super sized sandwiches loaded with veggies, bacon, cream cheese..... served on a frisbee.
You cant go wrong here. Sandwiches so big many people are using a fork and knife.  These are good sandwiches to share
Did I say they put cream cheese on the sandwiches - excellent!!!??!"}
{"text":"It was instant love for me with Beach Hut Deli. I've known about this spot for awhile, but wasn't in a rush to try \"just\" a sandwich place. I've been missing out as a result.

During my visit to the deli we were greeted by the friendly employees as soon as we walked in. When they brought our orders to the table they waited a minute to make sure we had everything we needed. At the end of our meal someone came out to make sure we enjoyed everything. Great service!

My second Beach Hut Deli experience was a take-out order at work. Ordering for an office was also easy. The menu was easy to find on their website. I called in the six orders and the woman that took my order repeated everything back at the end for accuracy. All of the orders were correct when we picked them up. We were quoted 15-20 minutes to prepare our order and it was indeed ready when we arrived in that amount of time.

The menu is very unique with sandwich and sub options that you won't find at other delis. Regular size subs are 6\" and Large size subs are 9\". I was happy to see that they have a Dude/Duddette option which is 3\" for subs and half a sandwich for the gourmet sandwiches. The subs are all loaded with meat and toppings so for me a 3\" sub is plenty with a side. 

The Hobie is their version of an Italian with salami, pastrami, provolone, and Italian dressing. It's loaded with meat and toppings for a delicious and filling sub. The Mahalo Taco (special) was one of the best subs I've ever tasted. It included taco seasoned roast beef and chips. Trying to describe the amazing flavor of this sub is impossible. The flavors all worked so well together. This sub was also packed with meat and toppings. The High Tide has pastrami, ham, bacon, pepper jack cheese, and thousand island dressing on cheese bread. It was very tasty, but I think the sub bread is better than the sandwich bread. The Potato Salad and Pasta Salad are both obviously made in house and are delicious. The Potato Salad has large pieces of potato with skin on and a delicious dressing. The Pasta Salad has orzo pasta, cheese, sundried tomatoes, and artichokes. The flavor is great."}
{"text":"They allow dogs on the patio, which is nice. The sandwich and salad we ordered were fresh, but nothing gourmet or special. The girl working the front was spacey. 


It has some weird Hawaiian-Jamaican vibe, but is based in CA.  I guess it's a good outdoorsy place to grab a beer, but I won't be dreaming of returning."}
{"text":"Beach Hut Deli is awesome. The Surfin Bird and the Surfin Cow are delicious. Portions are outstanding! You will definitely get full here. The photos people have posted are true advertisement, so yes the sandwiches are really that thick. Best sandwich shop I have been to in years."}
{"text":"Was hungry for something pastrami based and with enough meat to tell what you are eating. Two words...Santa Cruz. Fresh bread, generous toppings and a pile of meat. Carnivores will go away content. I really hate to say this but move over Capriotti's and Weiss. Also check out their happy hour specials. Nice selection on tap. Okay only thing preventing that fifth star is they have coke products and I am a Pepsi person. Will be a regular stop, you bet. Forgot to mention staff was great, answered questions and offered suggestions. Great lunch experience! Look forward to hitting a couple happy hours...32oz craft beer for $4, move over Barley's.... Nah can't go that far."}
{"text":"What could I say about Beach Hut Deli sandwiches? Quality. Big. No, huge portions. Order a small and you'll be fine. I am fine for TWO days in fact because a small sandwich can be two lunches for me. Fun, cool island vibe and awesome staff. Oh - brewskis if you want them. Yes, I just said brewskis. Haha.

I used to visit BHD in Reno when I was in college. I remember the shop opening up and daaaaaaaaayum the sandwiches were good. They're still good today. I was so happy to hear there was a location that opened up here.

I came in during Noon-time and it actually wasn't even that busy which was surprising, but they must get some good crowds for their happy hour. YES. This sandwich shop has a happy hour.

I had the flying pig, which has pretty much everything I love in a sandwich. Tasty ham, bacon, avocado, cream cheese, cheese, lettuce, tomato, and thin cut red onions. GAH. I am salivating right now. Order it hot. Or not. Both ways are good.

My only issue is this... since there are so very many sandwich places in this particular area it's kind of hard to choose the best. But even though I love BHD, I think Firehouse Subs is better, but that's just my particular taste. Mainly I pick Firehouse over BHD because of the perfect sizing of their sandwiches. Firehouse's sandwiches can actually fit in my mouth, um, as dirty as that sounds. And they are easier to eat. But really, both places are better than Subway or POS. 

BHD - I will be back."}
{"text":"Loved the one in Reno when we lived there. So stoked it opened in Vegas! This place kicks ass!
Check out the Santa Cruz, and try it hot with the works! Pastrami, avocado, bacon and cream cheese... epic!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine decided to bring me to this place. We live up north in Las Vegas and I thought the drive would be a waste to drive here just for a sandwich, but was I wrong. 

Warm and juicy sandwiches have been one of my favorite things to eat now and this was the perfect place for just that. The \"Shark Bite\" was absolutely DELICIOUS! I found it weird for the sandwiches to include cream cheese, but it actually tastes really good! The spot is nice and chill and the variety of sandwiches they offer sounded pretty great as well. 

I definitely look to drop by here anytime I'm down in the area and hopefully one day there will be one a bit more closer than this. Overall, great sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Delish. Don't let the \"small\" fool you. They seriously over stuff their 6\" sandwich (see my photo)....to quote Homer Simpson: \"I can't believe I ate the whole thing!\". The sandwich itself was tasty, and they clearly put in some effort to make it look assembled nicely (again, look at my photo).  Overall, I didn't mind shelling out the $9 for a sandwich. The interior is a little kitschy, but so am I. I'll definitely be back the next time I need to scratch my sammich itch."}
{"text":"Yum!! Delicious sub sandwiches with a Cali Cool feel.  I get the Veggie California with avocado, sprouts and I add tuna.  Gourmet made to order.  Such a fun real staff!! I love Andrea and Louise.  Surf tunes playing and killer micro brews on draft.  Pipeline Porter. Great White.  An outdoor patio.  It feels like home.  Oh and they have Dirty chips - Funky Fusion is the best :). All for about the price of Subway.  Thanks guys - never change :)"}
{"text":"Finally got to com here for lunch today and it was pretty good. Nice beach theme inside and the restaurant was very clean. I had he beach bikini sandwich and it was sooooo good! Boyfriend had the sunrise which is a club sandwich. They put a lot of meat and veggies so it's worth the price! Cant wait to come back and get the bikini sandwich again."}
{"text":"(B) I've been to 2 locations a combined total of 5 or 6 times. I've never been there during an event, although I'm pretty sure they have musical guests every now and then. For that reason this review will be based mostly on food. I was there during happy hour though, and you get to roll dice for drink specials, so that was kind of fun.
   On to the food. I've had \"The Woody \"a couple times and Cali Cheese Steaks on a few occasions. \"The Woody\" , which is a hot roast beef sammich, with tobasco,bullseye, bacon, cheddar, cream cheese,mayo, onions, and lettuce. It's a bit pricey for a Sammich at aroun $12, but it's huge. For the typical person, they'd probably have to take half home. The cream cheese is genius, and tobasco is not hot. If your not into beef or BBQ, this is not for you. I highly recommend it. Like I said, this is too big for a single serving, but I found myself stuffing my stomach to the rafters! Typically this would be a high end roast beef sub, but the addition of bacon, 2 sauces, and cream cheese, AND then cooked?! Well that just takes it to a different level. As for this sandwich alone, 4 out of 5. Brisket would get em 5.
  About that Cheese Steak doe...Very good. The way they make it is with Monterey jack and cream cheese. So they call it like a California Cheese Steak. It very good. They grill all the ingredients together. This makes a beautiful mixture of peppers, cheese, and beef, just playing off of each other. Now you can customize this and get cheddar and what not, what ever veggies you want, but what I will say is that there no cheese wiz. So if you're trying to get an authentic Philly, this is not the place. That's why they call it a cali cheese steak. I'd still give this a 4 out of 5.                  
   Onward to the Beach Comber. Now this is what another person in my party got. \"It's a lot of food, and very fresh. It's like you really got it from a deli.it is a customizable sandwich, so you can get exactly what you want.\"
   When it comes to mid priced, and fast served sandwiches this is a TOP SPOT. I've never had bad service. I've always left satisfied, they have a great beer selection, and the food is plentiful and great. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Fantastic sandwiches!  Their prices are higher than your average sandwich shop but you definitely your money's worth. They pack each sandwich full of high quality meats and vegetables and the bread is soft and delicious. I'm not easily impressed by most sandwich places but this one made my top 5."}
{"text":"My favorite place in town for Sandwiches. The Spiccoli is the greatest and they have great beers on tap for a decent price. Outdoor patio has bags, and decent music is always playing.

My kids love it as well, they have grilled cheese AND PBJs. Happy hour consists of rolling a die and getting a dollar off the corresponding beer... It's awesome.

Best chill place to eat sandwiches and drink decent beer in the whole area."}
{"text":"After a weekend in Las Vegas, we ended up having our best meal here on the way home to Phoenix. There were 6 of us and all ordered something different. All of us were happy with our choices. My daughter's \"Surfin' Bird\" (Turkey, avocado, bacon and cream cheese) sounded simple but, with all the trimmings, was mind-bogglingly large and utter perfection. We also shared a Skinny Dipper which was excellent and also loved the Malibu (Hot, chopped pastrami and swiss on toasted garlic cheese bread with mayo, Italian dressing and avocado)  Never thought to put avocado on pastrami but will definitely think of it next time. I only wish they had a Phoenix location."}
{"text":"Freaking Beach Hut Deli mannnnn. I swear, I'm telling everyone about this place! If you're looking for an amazing gourmet sandwich this is THE place to go!"}
{"text":"I placed an order through postmates and when my order was delivered to my house I noticed I was missing a sub. I called beach hut to find out if my sub was just forgotten at the store and the manager tiff apologized for the missing sub. She even said that she would be willing to drive it down to my house to deliver it. I was so shocked that a manager would actually do this so I drove down to pick it up myself and thank her for beyond the best customer service. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have to give major props to Beach Hut deli for making my Valentine's Day extra special!! I ordered my boyfriend's favorite sandwich from here through Postmates so it could be delivered to his office. I spoke with a woman on the phone, possibly Tif?, and asked if she could include a note for him. She said that wouldn't be a problem and I checked in again once the order had been placed. 

I was expecting a scribbled note on a napkin, which I would've been totally fine with, but instead she took the extra time to cut out a heart shape piece of paper and write the note very nicely on there. 

He was SO surprised and thrilled with his delivery and the note is now taped up in his kitchen :) Thank you so much for going the extra mile Beach Hut deli!!"}
{"text":"If you want large sandwiches , no holding back of the ingredients, and 1st class service make the Beach Hut Deli a top on your list. They have a menu of mouth watering meals for any taste bud! The owner and his cadre of incredible staff make your food and experience awesome. Eat here once and you will be a convert.

P.S. They have liter craft beers for less than anywhere in town and rad theme nights."}
{"text":"One of our clients brought a beautiful tray of sandwiches for lunch today. I went straight for The California which had avocado, red onions, tomatoes, alfalfa sprouts, banana peppers, Monterey cheese, and mayo on wheat bread. It was wonderful! So I immediately had to do more research about this deli and I am sold! The ingredients are incredibly fresh and I absolutely LOVE how much stuff is in the sandwich! The other three sandwiches look just as delicious (one has turkey and bacon, the second one has pastrami, and the third had pastrami and turkey).  I don't think I could ask of much more out of a sandwich: fresh ingredients, lots of vegetables, and tasty. I will definitely be taking my sandwich-loving fiancé to give it a whirl!"}
{"text":"My first Yelp review. Growing up in NY/NJ, I'm probably a foodie elitist so I apologize if I come off as obnoxious:

Vegas is definitely devoid of top-knotch sandwich shops.  Even the best ones have this sort of mass-produced quality.  Being used to \"mom and pop\" sandwich shops where everything is made on premises I'm pretty picky.  I do have to say that this place is pretty darn good.  It reminds me a little of Johnny McGuires at Town Square. 

The bread, meats and toppings are all good quality with very original sandwich concoctions.  While it still has that mass-produced feel, relatively speaking it's definitely one of the standouts in Las Vegas/Henderson.  They don't shy away from the amount of meat and try to just drown out the sandwich in toppings like a lot of sub shops do.  You definitely get your money's worth and I'll definitely return. 

I ordered the \"Santa Cruz\" sans the Avocado.  Good meat, great bacon and loved having cream cheese on the sandwich."}
{"text":"I don't know why I never took the time out to rate Beach Hut. I got a job here a few months ago and when I started my first day everything seemed great.... Until the corporate manager came in. She was filthy drunk dancing on customers and singing throughout the whole restaurant. People couldn't even enjoy a nice meal and on top of that their manager (Tiffany) is the worst manager in history. She was trying to get all the employees to drink on the job!!!! If I asked her a question about how to make a sandwich cause they make you remember everything on the menu she would get frustrated and yell at me. I quit after my third day working cause I was not going to take abuse from a work place. This place is full of unprofessional people that want to party before working and giving customer service. They didn't great customers nor take care of them. They simply walked around drinking beer from the tab and pretending to clean. Horrible business. Horrible customer service. They need a rescue and someone that knows what their doing."}
{"text":"Ok i eat here alot more than i would like to admit. Its always awesome,  the marley nachos are amazing!!!! I have mine with pineapple and bbq sauce.  Their warm sandwiches are big and filling and so delicious you don't want to miss a thing. I love the hard root beer on tap for HAPPY HOUR !!! which by the way is a very happy time for us at beach hut. We love tiffany the manager she is friendly and caring and fun. The staff in general are kind and helpfull."}
{"text":"Dude! This place is AWESOME! Me and husband were hungry and came across this place, so we decided to give it a try. I ordered the North  Shore and my hubby ordered the Righteous Rueben. Let me tell you, I'm originally from frisco(San Francisco for those of you not from the bay) and when I bit into that sandwich it immediately brought me back to memory lane. Its like I was having a taste of the bay and this sandwich just put me under a spell. My husband devoured his sandwich in euphoria and said that we should make it a weekly routine to come here. Food is BOMB DOT COM!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! I'm a vegetarian and they have so many options!!! My boyfriend, who is a carnivore, loves it too! They also have beer and a patio you can have dogs on. Also the pasta salad is super good yummmm!!"}
{"text":"This place is straight out of my husband's childhood. It started in Granite Bay, CA and as you can see, it has grown from there! There is an amazing selection of sandwiches (of course) and some delicious looking nachos. You will be surprised by how much sandwich you get for your money. But wait there's more...happy hour! Including draft beers (stone & wasatch to name a few). The happy hour deal, I'm sure I will be trying this week, is marley nachos & a a pint for $9!!

The atmosphere is delightfully cartoonish and therefore perfect for Vegas. Besides the surfboard inspired booths inside, there is a large area outside for dining when the temperature hits the other side of 100. 

I recommend the Surfin' Bird - hold the mayo. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Minus one star for paying for my chips and the cashier not giving them to us.

The staff here does a great job at explaining the different sandwich sizes by detailing the amount of meat that goes into each particular size. All of the sandwiches here are unique in their own way from offering items like pineapple, or cream cheese. Me and my +1 shared the Pig Kahuna and were stuffed! The sandwich was full of flavor (with a nice kick from the tabasco sauce) Note: These sandwiches are served open faced, don't plan on folding it or it'll fall apart because there's so much meat!

Though their hours aren't the most Vegas friendly, Beach Hut Deli offers a true \"beachy\" experience with their décor and menu options. I definitely plan on returning to make my way down the menu!

PS. They have several beer options if you're feeling particularly thirsty."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad sandwich here. This is one if those places that always delivers. My new favorite sandwich is the shark bite. I highly recommend it. Ham, bbq sauce, cream cheese, bacon, lettuce, red onion on a toasted garlic bread. Delicious."}
{"text":"Went there for \"happy hour\"... Wasn't too happy. Weird service/ ordering system. Was asked to order & pay right after stepping into the joint... Had no idea what drinks they even had to choose from. After questioning the cashier, she rambled off a couple beers I have never heard of. She let me try a sample of one, which I didn't care for. Left after my boyfriend finished his beer.. I think he enjoyed it tho :)"}
{"text":"Delious veggie sub! The Monteray is so tasty and I could only finish half a size medium! Great bread and about 2 avocados on my sub! Huge!"}
{"text":"We polled our whole family and it's a consensus five star. If we weren't passing through town we would have gone back the next day. And the day after that! Generous portions of tender, fresh (not processed) meat, perfectly cooked bacon and fresh avocado made every sandwich we ordered a taste sensation. The staff was fantastic."}
{"text":"Before we get to the food, I just want to say.... what great service here as the staff are nice and very helpful.

The Wait - You are going to wait for your sandwich. Don't come in here thinking it is going to be like Subway or Port of Subs.  Each sandwich is handcrafted and the ingredients are very fresh!  We waited about 15 minutes for all our sandwiches to come out.  The good news, if you go at the right time, try one of their beers that they have.  Great flavors.

The Sandwiches - Wow.  The taste is wonderful. I won't go into describing all the different types, but you can look them up yourself.  All I can say, is that you are getting great quality ingredients, fresh, a ton of them and the sandwiches are created with a lot of \"otherness\" to them that makes them taste great.

The Salads - Had mine as a salad as I did not want bread.  Next time, I am going to try it with the lettuce wrap.

The beers - What a nice selection of draft beers that are from those beachy type of places.

The ambiance - Very cool, very room, very nice.

GK says, great food, service and quality.  They even made a special for my vegan daughter.

Check it out!"}
{"text":"This place is freaking amazing. Go here, try everything, get a beer, sit on the patio (if it's nice outside of course) and enjoy yourself. My boyfriend and I recently went here seeking amazing sandwiches and they delivered!!! We ordered beers, sat on the patio when the weather was perfect, and listened to Jack Johnson and Bob Marley which really made us really feel like we were by the beach... The food is delicious!!!! YUM!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed in my Santa Cruz sandwich:( 
There is soooooo much mayo that I can't even find the bacon. Every time I bite into it the mayo squirts out the side of my mouth. 

I won't even get started on my husbands meatball sandwich.. He eats everything and he won't even finish it!  

I'm really bummed out and sad that I just sent $38 on a horrible meal."}
{"text":"Great first trip, I passed two sandwich shops on the way over including one a few doors down from this one and so happy I did. We got turkey and provolone and a tuna sub - both excellent but we both agreed the turkey won. Cheapskates might not like it since you can't get a footling for 5$ but for people like me who value quality over quantity definitely stop by! I would have given 5 stars but the pasta salad had an odd pickling flavor I couldn't place and didn't care for. I loved that a sandwich could get as creative or as plain as you liked since some sandwich shops are trending toward mashing any flavor combinations that come to mind. Super friendly staff and a completely casual atmosphere are perfect for a surf side sandwich shop feel. The space is huge too so lots of room to spread out."}
{"text":"Beach Hut Deli is a Las Vegas gem.  The laid back atmosphere, generous portions, and delicious sandwiches are unique to the Las Vegas restaurant industry.  

I've only had the pleasure of visiting Beach Hut twice, but I plan on returning as soon as another sandwich craving hits me.  Call me crazy, I actually ordered the Surfin' Bird two days in a row.  The mix of soft bread with cream cheese, bacon, and avocado makes my mouth water as I type - if only this was a zero calorie entree!

I'm leaving 5 stars because I want you to experience Beach Hut Deli, but BRING A SWEATSHIRT (think Jimmy John's temperatures).  It was freezing both times I visited the Eastern Ave location, however, I'd much prefer it to be cold than warm.  

Check it out!"}
{"text":"I've been to Beach Hut Deli twice now. I have to credit my husband Joel for finding this place on Yelp. If you have the munchies this place is for you. 

Their sandwiches are nothing short of epic. If you have a small appetite best plan on sharing because Beach Hut's sandwiches are HUGE! Their menu has so many choices which makes it hard to pick. Not only do they have sandwiches they have hot dogs and even homemade soups. Some sandwiches we have ordered were the Skinny Dipper, which had roast beef and melted cheddar cheese. Plus, it came with a side of au jus. The Woody is my favorite so far. It oozes with roast beef, cheddar cheese, red onion and cream cheese. That's right huge globs of cream cheese. Mmmmm all those flavors just melt together between the soft rolls. I also have tried the Clam Chowder and the pasta salad. I know they specialize in sandwiches, (which are amazing), but the soup was luke warm and lacked seasoning. The pasta salad had a sweet note that I did not enjoy. 

I love the seating on the inside of Beach Hut. They have a huge couch as well as regular chairs and tables. The outside patio is a nice change, but be careful some of those chairs hurt your bum! Sitting outside when the weather is nice is definitely part of the charm of Beach Hut. I do really like the staff here too. They are always so friendly and look genuinely happy to be there. 

No matter what time of day or what problem your having a Beach Hut Deli sandwich can cure you. With their melty cheese, flavorful meat and their boldness to use cream cheese you just can't go wrong. Mmmmm it's calling my name right now! LOL"}
{"text":"I had this notion that I wanted to go on a hike today and since I hadn't eaten anything I thought why not grab a sandwich and enjoy it after my hike. What a fab idea, if I do say so myself! 

I came in and they were vibing out to reggae. I knew I would love this place right off the bat! I decided on the Surfin bird before arriving. I ordered a large to share with my future husband. I took it to go and shared it with my love after we made our way up black mountain. The veggies were still crisp and the sandwich wasn't soggy! The creaminess from the cream cheese paired well with the bite of the onion. I added sprouts but the sandwich normally comes with turkey,bacon, avacado, tomato, lettuce, onion, pickles, peppers, mayo, mustard and cream cheese. I couldn't have picked a better sandwich to eat on a beautiful day after a great hike. Probably one of the best cold cut sandwiches I've had. The bread was freshly baked too everything about this sandwich was so yummy. 

They also serve beers and mimosas. Bottomless mimosas are $15 and they have beers on tap including a kona longboard 
Lager and other unique ones I haven't seen before. I'm not a drinker and I'm not familiar with beers anyway, but if you are you can definitely get one and chill here on the couch and catch some tv or watch the game. 

I look forward to trying more sandwiches from Beach Hut Deli I love the beach theme and the cool vibe here."}
{"text":"Ok, sooooo I'm a sandwich lover and I've walked in here a couple of times, and just couldn't bring myself to paying $9.00 for a sandwich..... and no chips and soda for that price!  So I ordered a pastrami!  I can't say much about the service, it was ok, nothing stood out!  The bread was super soft! the pastrami was ok!  I don't think it was worth $9.00.  I can go to Zupas, and get a salad and a sandwich for $8 and some change!

I might go back and try there dry salami sandwich, but other than that, I don't see me going there on a regular basis!"}
{"text":"This sandwich shop does not disappoint!  There is a nice California surfer vibe inside with cool art work.  There is also a covered outdoor patio.  My go-to sandwich is the pastrami and the portion size is huge! I usually share with somebody.  These sandwiches are stacked and it is a challenge to get everything in one bite; however, each bite is delectable because you get an awesome flavor and texture combo everytime.  There is crunch from the bacon, onions, and pickle. Creaminess from the avocado and cream cheese.  All of these combined make a great sandwich.  They offer happy hour on beer and nachos.  The nachos are pretty good too!"}
{"text":"Took my second trip to BHD recently and it was better than the first.  This time, smartly I might add, I brought my wife so we could get two sammies and split.  We went with the Spicolli (delish turkey breast, bacon, ranch, lettuce, french roll) and the Skinny Dipper (roast beef, melted cheddar, onions, mayo and au jus).  I'd be hard pressed to tell you which one I liked better.  Traditional french dips I come across seem to be lazy and played out.  The beef isn't what it should be and it's just another sandwich.  Here the beef and cheese are in perfect harmony - and there isn't so much mayo that it's over-bearing and oozing out.  The only bummer is that I liked each sandwich so much I'd be afraid to try a different one.

Other pluses - they serve beer and have several HD TVs (with sports on).  I also believe they have free wifi because the first time I went there was a big group of guys doing a fantasy football draft."}
{"text":"Bright and airy with a friendly staff. Large menu selection of unique sandwich combos.  Some unique micro brews also available. Prices are average and there is a large outdoor seating area and surfboard tabled booths."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this location.  I mean I REALLLLYYYY wanted to like this spot.  I grew up near Beach Hut in northern Cali and it quickly was one of my favorite lunch spots of all time.   I was stoked when I moved to NV and saw that they had a Beach Hut, it was one of the first places I had to go eat.  Upon arriving, I gave my order to a worker that I'm not sure knew where he was.  There are certain things I like on a sandwich and certain things I don't, usually it's not complicated and this was no exception.  Somehow just ordering turned into an approx 10 min ordeal.  I wish I could explain how it took so long to just go through what I wanted and what I didn't, but unfortunately I went through the process of repeating it twice (very slowly) and he still seemed confused.  The sandwich came out after another 10 min wait and was awesome, the food here I truly can't knock, it really is good.

The next time going here was fairly uneventful luckily (which truly should be expected at anywhere I go).  There was a longer than normal wait considering my order was the only one they were making, but the food made up for it.

My next trip here really bothered me to the point that I don't wish to go back.  I want to say, I DON'T mind waiting if the food is worth it, I may get a little annoyed considering there's typically no cooking for a sandwich, but I'll deal with it and be happy.  So upon walking in, I head right to the counter and give my order for a To-Go order.  Based on my previous experiences with Beach Hut in general, I know it'll take 5-10 minutes at least.  After being outside for maybe a minute or two tops, a young girl calls my name and tells me that my order is ready, which I found out.  I asked if she was sure it was mine which she tells me \"yes\", I repeat back what I ordered just to make sure because this seemed unusually quick.  She again tells me that it's mine while looking slightly annoyed.  Unfortunately I feel like somehow it's my fault for not trusting my gut instinct and actually opening up the sandwich and checking to make sure it was right.   So fast forward to 15-20 drive home and opening up \"my\" sandwich... well... i think you can guess that it wasn't mine.  If it was just a minor screw up like the same # but with/without onions I would be ok with it, but unfortunately this was just completely a different sandwich.  I don't prefer to have mustard and this thing was loaded up.  

Normally I'd chalk it up to just a normal error like when Fast Food happens to toss the wrong item on your burger, but this just doesn't have the same feel to it.  If there was more people inside ordering at the time I could understand just tossing the wrong sandwich in the wrong bag, unfortunately there was only 1 other person ordering and that was after me.  Best guess is they screwed up someone's sandwich and found a quick way to get rid of it.  

I'm sure in the future I'll break down and give this place another shot based on my love affairs with the ones from my home town, but I just don't see it happening anytime soon.  It's been 3 months since my last time here and I don't know when I'll try it again.

The food really is great and based on that alone I want to rate this 5 stars, just the employees/service bring this one down so badly to the point I feel 1.5/2 stars is appropriate."}
{"text":"Happy hour was from 3-6    2 dollar beers i have never heard of. Had long board   Was actually very good. Chill atmosphere with several tvs  hockey was on so it immediately caught my attention. Only had a couple beer sthen had to leave cause they were closing but the food looked tasty. Neat looking place."}
{"text":"Oh how we love beach hut deli.  Very cool vibe. Love the Monterey sandwich.  And the nachos. What doesn't taste better with a bit of cream cheese?   Service is always friendly and fast.   Nice size portions and good prices.  This place should open for UFC fight nights etc like Buffalo Wild Wings.  I'm sure they would do well"}
{"text":"I would never eat here again! I ordered the bqq pulled pork nothing about it was pulled it was cubed extremely spicy and drenched in bbq sauce! After taking one bite I asked to exchange it but they made me pay for a whole new sand which after spending 35$! I waited forever for the new sandwich that I decided to take it to go.Not only was  the manager rude, but she made everyone else's sandwhich who came after me first. The soup was bland and watery no cheese, which one would expect from chicken tortilla soup, they also visibly microwave everything to warm it. Gross never again. I'm still hungry!!"}
{"text":"Had the pulled pork salad and it was amazing!    Ice make was down, but the pulled Pork salad was AMZING!!!"}
{"text":"We all love this place... myself, my wife, and the dogs.  Great selection of sandwiches, vegan, vegetarian, meat eater etc. Perfect for us as I try to keep it vegan and my wife is the opposite. They also have a great selection of soups. Vegan ones as well. 
Their is a fabulous outdoor patio that us and the dogs really enjoy. Inside has plenty of seating and tvs with sports on most often. Oh yeah let's not forget they also have a good beer selection on draft and bottles. Do your self a favor and go enjoy this place.
 I almost forgot to mention the friendly and fast service. Every time I've been here the kids or adults working have been kind,helpful and do there jobs well."}
{"text":"Was looking for a new Deli....nothing like a good sandwich. Went online, read the menu and saw that a lot of their sandwiches had cream cheese in them and one of my favorite delis of all time had cream cheese on it so I thought, why not...let's give this place a shot! When we pulled up, a typical strip mall location. The sign was a little hard to see...but when we walked in it was decorated with a great beach theme. Walked over to the counter grabbed a menu and decided what to have. The cashier was very friendly ...asked if we had any questions...welcomed us ...we ordered 2 sandwiches, my man had the Hobie a  pastrami and salami with provolone and Italian dressing medium in size, he brought half home because it was so big and packed full of meat, and I had the beach bikini, turkey with sprouts, sunflower seeds, and cream cheese...on wheat bread. I took off the cranberry sauce. We sat down at our table which was a surf board. We liked the atmosphere, nice reggae music playing and for how busy they were it was pretty quiet. I looked outside to their patio and think when the weather is cooler, it would be really nice to sit outside, have a beer and play their corn hole games set up. When our food came out a very friendly staff member brought it to us, asking if we needed anything else. The sandwiches were served on a frisbee...great idea!!! Perfect for the theme! The meat was WONDERFUL, fresh ingredients. Really tasty pastrami! The only thing I would have added to mine was some purple onion and maybe a tomatoe...but it was wonderful regardless!!! ;) we will definitely be back...even though it was a drive for us...it was definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"10 times better than Lee's next store. I was going to order the medium sandwich and the guy looked at me like I was on bath salts. The small is really a LARGE so stick w/ the small. 

Sandwich was great!  Would totally go back. 

My only drawback is 1) I asked for mayo on the side....I got mayo on my sub and 2) there's no healthy sides [pasta salad something] all their chips are the full fat varietal as well. No baked, no sun chips, nothing :( 

Not great for healthy side eaters, but on the flip side they proudly display calorie count of all sandwiches on their menu :)"}
{"text":"This place is hidden. I would have never found out about it if a friend hadn't of brought it up one day when we were out for lunch.

I tried both vegetarian sandwiches and they were awesome. These sandwiches are huge, and I mean HUGE! I ordered the small both times and they both were HUGE! I swear they put an entire avocado on them! 

You can eat inside or out, and the outside layout reminds me of something I've seen in LA or Palm Springs. Can't wait to come back and try some of their other sandwiches. Slowly but surely working my way down the menu. And the staff here is super nice! If you haven't tried this place and like a good sandwich, add this to your list and do it now! :)"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Amazing sandwiches, ambiance, and customer service. My favorite place to go for lunch and have a few beers. It is so relaxing and feels like a home away from home. 

The sandwiches are huge and so scrumptious! I especially love the cream cheese added. yum yum yum!"}
{"text":"Yummy! Great service and fresh, yummy sandwiches. This is our new spot to pick up sandwiches. So glad we found it!!"}
{"text":"So I have been hear twice, and both times the food and service was great 


They always accommodate the fact that I do not like cheese, and most places would not substitute but they do.  

Price is a bit more then a good New Jersey or NY hero but it is worth the price in the  long run"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing sandwiches, great atmosphere hands down the best sandwich shop in town. The Santa Ctuz and skunny dipper are my favorites. The sanfwhiches are the right price, a large being 14 dollars but you get everything at a premiium and not a thin line of meat like the other guys. If you havent been here GO NoW!"}
{"text":"Food: 12\" surfin bird with alfalfa sprouts and Italian dressing added with bread toasted and a grilled cheese on sliced garlic sourdough. Split bird with hubby and sandwich was huge - I couldn't finish my half. 

Location: on Eastern in same plaza as Lee's sandwiches and Smashburger. 

Enjoyed dog friendly large patio with nice tunes playing! 

Service: very friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"I love coming here for lunch.  The sandwiches as delicious as they are huge! Every time I've come in,  I've been greeted by the friendly staff. I especially love the patio area where you can eat outside on nice days.  I usually come after the lunch rush so I've never seen it busy in here.  The wait for food or service has never been long for me."}
{"text":"/wow, wow wow!!!!

New to the Henderson area fresh from the Westside of the LV valley, I was craving a deli sandwich for lunch (I also want a beer with a meal 99/100 times)... So my boyfriend suggested this place and we scooted down to the Beach Hut Deli. LOVE! 

This fun little place is in the middle of a bustling shopping center filled with cool shops and other great eats, but once you spot the Hawaiian style dried grass canopy outside on the patio during the warm Las Vegas day you will want to enjoy a meal here on a reoccurring basis. There is a large seating area inside full of TVs, cozy booths, and a giant comfy couch. Every where you look you will find something fun to look at. There are gorgeous sunset murals and fun beachy signs. The patio is very large, well lit, and covered.

The menu is filled with a bunch of perfectly unique sandwiches that aren't too wildly out there. I had the Woody... hot roast beef, bbq sauce, crispy bacon and a slice of cream cheese among other things, your standard melted cheddar cheese, mayo, onions and finely shredded lettuce. My honeypie went with the Spicolli. hot turkey breast slices with melted cheddar cheese on a toasted roll with ranch dressing, lettuce and bacon. We both ordered a small size sandwich and traded a half with each other. (It's the funnest way to try things!) Both were absolutely delicious, but I was much more partial to my sandwich. I would have enjoyed the toasted roll of his though. Sadly, I didn't get my full Hawaiian fix because they were out of mac salad!!! They do have potato salad and an Italian style pasta salad too, but I really needed that mac!!! Large section of potato chips as well.

They have beer on tap!!!! I. LOVE. BEER. Let me warn you, the large beer is L.A.R.G.E. I'm talking huge. Too big for me, which is saying a lot. It might be... like.... a full six pack. Ok, not a full six pack... but by our estimation it was a solid 40oz of frosty cold brew.
 
Another HUGE bonus is Rogue Hazelnut Brown Ale ON TAP!!!! It's quite tasty and one of my favorite beers ever!!

It is a very laid back eatery, although a little too laid back in the safety/health department. Don't read me wrong, it's VERY clean. I am just slightly particular having worked in the food service industry before. The girls working the station were wearing sandals, which let's be honest- the second you drop a knife cutting my sandwich you are going to lose a toe. Also, I FIRMLY stand by the ponytail rule: if your hair is touching your shoulders, it should be pulled back into a neat ponytail. It's not a fashion show, it's my lunch.

Overall 4/5 stars. I will return for sure, but I hope to see some close toed shoes and properly managed hair. I also know to ask for a toasted bun on my hot sandwich and order the small beer."}
{"text":"5 years ago I was living in reno and beach hut deli was huge there. When I say huge I mean long lines crowed shop and sometimes up to an hour wait for a sandwich. But obviously if you have had there sandwiches it was so worth the wait. Now moving back to vegas I was sad that the only time I could get a bomb Santa Cruz when I visit my sister who is still in reno. Now finding out there is a beach hut deli here excited is a dull adjective to discrive my feelings. Now I live a good hour away but it is so worth the trip. Vegas people do not understand how amazing this place is. Walking into the shop I was amazed to see the lack of business!! This place is huge with games and so much sesting. Great beers and obviously  amazing food!!! Seriously we need to make this place poppin! Spears the word  and get vegas to understand  the goodness of this place not only for substance but also for the welcoming atmosphere! I hate driving so if I can make there drive then  you can!!!"}
{"text":"Beach Hut Deli seemed to be all the rage at work, so a bunch of us decided to go one day and it was the best decision ever! There is a really cool island vibe inside, surf boards on the walls and your sandwiches are served on Frisbees. I love the automatic doors and the giant menu on the wall so you can decide what you want without holding up the line. I have since been here about 3 times and look forward to coming back again really soon. 

On my first visit I went for the classic, surfin bird. When it arrived it was so large I wasn't sure how I was going to eat it. You definitely want to stick to the small! The sandwich had great flavor and everything really worked together perfectly. I was a little worried about the slices of cream cheese, but it added a nice creamy texture to the sandwich. On my next visit I split the Spicolli with a friend and we were a bit disappointed. The ticket machine stopped working so we waited a little longer than normal and then the sandwich didn't have much flavor. We could taste the turkey and bacon, but not the ranch which would have really tied the flavors together. I came again the next day for lunch with my husband and fell in love with the Hobie. This classic Italian sub really did it for me. I loved the Italian dressing and all of the flavors really worked perfectly together. I also really love the Dirty brand potato chips that they sell, they are super delicious and a perfect crunchy compliment to any sandwich.

This is easily one of the best sandwiches that you will find in Las Vegas. I love that their sandwiches all have a twist, rather than being the same old sandwiches you get anywhere. They definitely have a signature style and flavor profile and I am a huge fan. I am already excited for my next visit!"}
{"text":"Come with an appetite because these sandwiches are packed full!

So far I've tried the surfin bird and santa cruz. These are both cold sandwiches, and they're pretty much the same but one has turkey and the other pastrami. Along with the meat, they come with avocado, bacon, cream cheese, mayo, mustard, pickle, onion, lettuce, greek pepper and cheese. Like I said, the sandwich is packed full! The cream cheese is an interesting topping, which I like, but I personally think it's spread on a little thick. The sandwiches come in small, medium, large and I would definitely suggest splitting if you go for a medium or large, as they are quite filling. The hot sandwiches sound pretty interesting too, so I'll have to come back for one of those. 

Along with the food, they also offer beer which is pretty awesome. They usually even have happy hour specials for both the beer and food. 

For a chain deli, the atmosphere is really nice and you have an option of sitting inside or outside. And outside, you can sit in a covered or uncovered area. I even noticed they had the supplies for cornhole for customers to play. Definitely a great, casual place to check out."}
{"text":"Ummmm all I can say is YUUUMMM! 

the Malibu with a great white is where its at! 

Moved about a month ago and i miss this place. 

Best sandwiches in town by far!!!!"}
{"text":"Ridiculously long wait for a small sandwich. There was no one in line when we walked in, just a couple of people sitting at tables in the back. 

There was no one at the register to take our order but one of the young girls working there said she would be with us in a minute. We continued to wait. We finally had our order taken and went with the Malibu, hot pastrami and swiss on toasted garlic cheese bread. 

We must have waited well over ten minutes and when I picked up the sandwich it was already disappointing. It was really small, and looked like something I could have made at home in 2 minutes. It tasted fine but nothing anyone else couldn't have done in half the time. The bread seemed like regular white bread, did not taste and garlic or cheese. The menu descriptions sound great, but the actual product falls short."}
{"text":"I love the open area beach concept of this location!  Even though it is in a \"Strip Mall\" type environment you can really get the beach feel.  The menu is posted on the wall, so I felt it was a bit hard to read, however they do have a paper version if you would like. The menu has many options from hot & cold sandwiches to salads.  They also have the calories listed so if you are watching the waistline, you can make a choice based on that!  The Surfing Bird sandwich I had on the Garlic and Cheese Sourdough bread was a huge helping of a sandwich!  I could have easily taken half home but it was so yummy that I ate it all!  It included the following fresh ingredients of turkey, avocado, bacon and cream cheese.  The cream cheese and bacon combo was delightful!  I wonder why I had never thought of that before!   

They do offer beer as well!  I'm planning on coming back some evening with a group of friend to sit relax and enjoy!"}
{"text":"So I accidently stumbled upon this place while in a rush and starving for something super quick. Well I was very suprised!

Service: I walked in and was greeted with smiles! The guys behind the counter were not only super friendly but hilairous and had personality! You could tell they really enjoyed the food, they were either stoner surfer guys or total foodies; either way their passion for the place itself made be very content. They told me about the trivia nights, live bands and drink specials so I will def. be back. Over all the atmospere that those guys created was great (and I was only there for 10 minutes).

Food: Amazing! I forgot the exact name of the sandwich I had but it had hot pastrami, cream cheese and avacado...SOLD!

I will def. be back to really sit with a cold beer and enjoy the music!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with the wife on Monday for Lunch. After reading a good menu and noticing a fine selections of beerwe both chose different sandwitchs. I Had the Sinnydipper and my wife had the chesse steak. After what was a wait that I felt was longer that it should have been the sandwitchs arrived delivered to of table by a waitress that appered to be the only one serving. Both sandwitchs were great delivered hot. There was lots of very moist meat and good cheese. The bread was really good. The atmoshere here was great If you don't like Bob Marly you may not like the music but I thought it was great.The place is clean, the server was nice and the overall experience was great. They may need to hire a couple of more prep people or servers but we'll be back often. Food alone was worth it."}
{"text":"BEST SANDWICH I HAVE EVER EATEN! 

I took the other half to-go so I could recreate the \"amazing first bite\" experience again. 

Manager helped me create a custom sandwich and it was to die for. 

Very friendly staff, clean and fast!"}
