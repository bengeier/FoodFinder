{"text":"very happy with the food. I'd never had Velenzuelen food before . I had the Arepa very delicious . The spicy sauce and cilantro sauce topped it off. Amazing !!! I'd definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Just had Tequeños, Empanadas and Patacones!!got to say it was delicious and amazing everything was done to perfection, the patacones were super crispy, the empanadas were golden and the tequeños werd incredible!! Definetly a must for any foodie!!"}
{"text":"Muy Delicioso! I chance upon this food cart on the corner of Sunset and Fort Apache, right across Southern Hills Hospital. I tried Arepas somewhere else before and I was not impressed. But I decided to give Venezuelan food another try and I ordered Mr. Cooker's Beef Arepas and Chicken Patacones. Both are superb! The sauces are awesome also. I will definitely order from here again! Please try their food, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Wow! First time trying Valenzuelan cuisine... Won't be the last! Excellent service and flavorful food. I had the Beef Patacone and Chicken/Cheese Empanada. Alberto explained everthing on the menu. Looking forward to your next event location."}
{"text":"Who says you have to go the Strip to try and experience amazing food! I just found this cute little truck around the  city and i decided to give it a try' and Oh boy! This is Venezuelan cuisine gourmet style on wheels! Made form scratch on the spot, full of flavors and different textures that would make your palate go Crazy! I absolutely love it!"}
{"text":"The best food truck in town. Would say open a restaurant. But i think that might take away of a awesome street food experience. Two thumbs up find them if you can. Try a little bit of everything you'll never be disappointed. Find them at 4 p.m. to 8 o'clock at the farmers market Wednesday  Vegas Drive and Fort Apache...."}
{"text":"I had the great fortune of finding this truck at the Cowboy Christmas in Floyd Lamb Park yesterday.  The outside of the truck doesn't scream Venezuelan food so I was a bit skeptical. The young man who took my order described every item to me.  Service was spot on.  I ordered the chicken empanada and my husband ordered the Pork Pepito Sandwich.  OMG the flavors!!  To say the least they pack so much great flavor into their food. The portions were pretty large for the price as well.  The empanada was light and airy and filled with creamy chicken, cheese and seasonings that all complimented each other.  I tasted my husband's sandwich because I had never had one.  One bite and I wanted to order my own!  The pork was so tender and the sauce they cooked it in was divine!  I had to ask if they had a stand alone restaurant that I could visit whenever I liked.  I will just have to put a tracker on the truck so I can follow it around town.  If they drive into your area check them out.   I highly recommend them."}
{"text":"Seriously the best empanadas I have ever had and the employees are so nice. The only thing is they need to be in a busier area, so more people can try how amazing Mr. Cooker's food is!!"}
{"text":"I came across this truck as I was going to the park and decided to try it out for dinner. Interesting because I've never had Venezuelan food...and a truck? Cool!  Kinda intimidating because of the unknown, but as soon as you step up a kid steps out. He makes you feel at ease right away by helping you out with the menu. Smart of them, because I'm sure they know that the majority are not familiar with their cuisine. I'm sure most of us including myself relate Latin food with mexican food, but it isn't true and this wasn't an exception. We had a beef and a chicken empanada. The shape is similar to the kind I'm familiar with, but everything else is different. This had shredded chicken or beef and some kind of white cheese enveloped in a softer fry bread, I believe.  The patacones were similar to a tostada but the 2 circles that sandwiched it was plantain instead of flour tortillas. We had one shredded chix and one shredded beef (it believe this is how these 2 meats are prepared for all their dishes) which also consisted of onions, tomatoes and cheese garnished with cilantro. The arepitas are a cheesy tasty snack that my kid really enjoyed. If you're  a deep fried fanatic check this place out every Saturday and I think Friday when there's 6 other type of trucks for an event."}
{"text":"Amazing gluten free options.. Nice to have food trucks that offer no gluten &  you can customize to be vegetarian. Amazing flavors great food."}
{"text":"Got the pork filled arepa.  It is a gluten free arepa, so needless to say i was very excited. I got the chopped pork, I really wanted to like it. But it was too salty,  I put some of the salsas on it,  it helped some, but in the end I couldn't finish it.  I needed a keg of beer to wash down the salt.  Overall I thought maybe it needed onions or shredded lettuce or something.  It was just too much salt and the chunks of pork where overwhelming.    I'll come back and try the chicken or the beef."}
{"text":"Always a friendly face and delicious meal behind this food truck's counter. Straight from Venezuela this authentic Vegas treasure keeps it simple with their flavorful menu and fresh ingredients.  Have tried several items including their tequenos and simple arepa with queso-- great to say the least! Cheesy and light, just how I want them-- and very much true to home cooked Venezuelan foods.  Not just your run of the mill taco stand-- it's something outside the box and DEFINITELY worth a try."}
{"text":"I first got the pleasure to experience Mr Cooker a few months ago and since then I have been hooked! I even got my husband hooked. I first fell in love with the Pepito sandwich with chicken. It wasn't until recently that I ventured out and tried the Empanada and Patacone combo with chicken. I have been missing out! What turned me away prior to trying it was the fact that I don't like plantains. To my surprise, the chicken Patacone didn't taste like plantains at all. This combo is by far my favorite.   I can't wait until we meet again!"}
{"text":"Seriously, hands down my favorite food truck here at work. They have the best empanadas and tequenos. Not to mention my absolute favorite the patacones! They are a knock out for your taste buds. You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"We had the patacones (fried green plantain sandwiches), one with pork the other with chicken. Both were AMAZING."}
{"text":"I am Venezuelan so I know how Venezuelan food is supposed to taste. I am so glad this food truck opened so I can get my \"tequeños fix\". Tequeños may seem like mozzarella sticks, but they are not. These are white cheese sticks (not mozzarella, which flavor is milder) covered with a delicious dough (no bread crumbs) and then fried. They are simply delicious and these people know how to make them. I also tried their \"cachitos\". These are little breads with ham inside. I am not a fan of cachitos, but I have to say Mr Cooker's are amazing. Maybe it's because they use quality ingredients. They also created different versions, I would say, for the international customers. These 2 additional versions have shredded beef or vegetables. I did not tried them but both look delicious. Their golfeados are super delicious. It is very hard to find golfeados in the states and I am delighted Mr. Cooker is baking them. They might look to not Venezuelans as cinnamon rolls, but the ingredients are different. They have a special kind of cane sugar and sprinkled white cheese. The sweet and salty combination brings me back to super happy memories from my childhood.  I need to go back and try their pepitos. If they are as good as their other food that I tried, they must be outstanding. If you have never tried Venezuelan food, try it at this food truck. You won't regret it.  You can find them by following their Facebook or Instagram accounts."}
{"text":"OMG!  this is the best food I've had in years!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I can't believe it. So many flavored in my mouth. Omg!!!!!!!!  I feel like I'm born again lol favorite food place starting today.  thank you God for making this place happen."}
{"text":"Solid value for some of the best Venezuelan food around. Mr: Cooker is a Las Vegas truck! I had never had Venezuelan food before and I was greatly I did! There chicken Empanadas was the best ever & the special sauce was even more delicious! If you have seen Mr: Cooker around to try it, you miss out! Alberto was very nice & provide great customer service! Thank you so much! Keep up the great work it was worth it& delicious"}
{"text":"This food truck is just amazing I tried tequeños, Patacones, Arepas, Pepito but my favorite is the Empanada with beef, cheese and plantain. What is funny is that the cooker is actually the cartoon chef in the logo of the truck.  I go every week and you can find them on Facebook."}
{"text":"So I went to the food truck Strawberry Festival in Summerlin. To be honest, it was more like a farmers market with only two food trucks a couple shaved ice vendors and an elephant ear expert. By the time I got there most of the food trucks had been cleared out. I have never tried Mr. Cooker before, but I have to say I was extremely impressed.  I have never had a Papito sandwich, but I can tell you it was out of this world. My favorite touch was the Cheez whiz that was added to it. It was basically the equivalent of a Philly cheese steak but with Mexicana thrown into it :-)  their fries were also very crispy and delicious.  As with most food trucks it took forever for the food to come out, but once it did it was well worth the wait. I know this vendor has a location on the strip, but if you see them out and about make sure you give them some business because you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"Mr. Cooker never disappoints! After a long day at work when I'm overdue for lunch, all I need is to see this truck's location pop up on Instagram and I'm on my way to arepa heaven. Even at a food truck festival surrounded by options from other states, I'll pick this Venezuelan street food every time.  My daughter favors their delicious black beans. I always order a side of beans for her and she drinks them and makes a mess. The veggie arepa options include black beans, cheese, avocado, and fried plantains. I order mine \"con todo\" and it's perfect every time! The sauces are irresistible. I've tried a few special items such as fried balls of mashed yuca filled with cheese and I'm waiting for cachapas to make the menu someday. The Mr. Cooker family is some of the nicest people you will meet. If you are at all into South American street food, Mr. Cooker is my top recommendation.  Don't be misled by reviews that describe arepas and empanadas made of \"gluten free\" \"bread\" unless you also believe that Mexican tamales and corn tortillas fall into this category. The accurate description is corn masa. Gluten free corn, amazing!"}
{"text":"Stopped by yesterday at First Friday. I have always wanted to try patacones and they did not disappoint. Absolutely incredible flavor in the plantains. The beef was tasty and the whole sandwich was incredible."}
{"text":"I am a venezuelan and I can say that this is the best venezuelan food in Las Vegas. For sure I will be back."}
{"text":"I found Mr. Cooker at a first Friday's event after moving to Las Vegas a few months ago. Ever since discovering them, I've been craving their patacones (beef) and pepito sandwiches (steak). The staff has always been fun and very nice. I've never had Venezuelan food before discovering their truck.  I wish they had a permanent location so I that wouldn't have to chase them all around town. I guess it's been worth it though because I met my current girlfriend at one of the Summerlin farmer's markets. I'm not saying that Mr. Cooker is a chick magnet, but I sure haven't had any problems. Thank you Mr. Cooker!"}
{"text":"Wow oh wow oh weeee! Absolutely has a special place in my heart. Pork patacones is out of this world. Such bomb bursting flavors. The beef empanada yes! Every time please. Sauces offered were soooo delocious. Boyfriend loved the cheese balls. Cant wait to have again. :D thank you so much to the cooks and cashiers. Ever so kind service."}
{"text":"Great food!!!!!  Very helpful in explaining what is in everything. Definitely recommend finding this food truck!!"}
{"text":"Obsessed with their arepas! My husband and I discovered them a while back, when we started going to the food truck extravaganza on Fort Apache, by the wine and spirits. All it took was 1 bite of their arepas and we were hooked. We literally kept coming just for their food. We love their patacones, yucca balls, fried plantains and possibly everything else on their menu. Their sauces are so delicious! Definitely my favorite food truck!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon them at Total Wines Free event by Town Square. Talk about finding a treasure!! We ordered the combo of beef empanadas and chicken patacone. OMG!! Out of this world. We've never had Venezuelan food but I can't safely say I LOVE IT!!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I'm addicted to the Patacones!! My new favorite food truck! Food is delicious and the staff is friendly and amazing!"}
{"text":"Great food i tried the beef patacone and chicken and cheese empanada  The patacone was simply amazing. Love the flavor of the sauce and the meat was excellent.   The empanada was good the chicken on the inside was exceptional.   Both combined totalled 10 $ and was well worth the money."}
{"text":"Coming from a Venezuelan...this is the best spot to eat arepas! The competition tastes too americanized."}
{"text":"In Hollywood, we'd crave Mucho Perro Columbian Hot Dogs... Haven't seen a Columbian food truck here in Vegas yet, but we did come across a Venezuelan one. Not sure what you call what we just tried, but it's basically an arepa, substituted with a tostone outside. Deeeelish! So glad we saw this on the way to my mom's house! It's right outside Top Shelf Craft Beer and Wines on the corner of Fort Apache/Sunset. Def a MUST!!!"}
{"text":"Beef Patacones!! Yum!! I ran into Mr. Cooker at First Fridays and was pleasantly surprised by the deliciousness. I had never had Venezuelan food before and I was greatly I did.   Also had the beef Empanadas! Biggest empanada I've ever had.   Loved Mr. Cooker & the staff was fun and awesome too!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for genuine Venezuelan food, this is your place. Delicious food and amazing service; this has been my best food truck experience so far. I'd recommend this place a thousand times if I could. 100,000/10"}
{"text":"Walking around Fremont St one Saturday I saw there were a few food tucks parked across from Atomic Liquor. After walking past a few my wife suggested we try Mr Cooker and I'm glad we did. Looking at the menu the Pepito and the Patacones caught our eye. -The Pepito was that of a steak and cheese sub with a South American twist. The braised meet is very flavorful with cheese, caramelized onions and some cilantro mayo type of condiment it was an excellent sandwich that had me return the following week for another. The bread that it is served is was also fresh and tasty, a perfect roll. - Patacones. I chose the shredded beef which is stacked between 2 larger sized fried plantains. Topped with ketchup, mayo and cheese this sounded a little strange but was very good. I would defiantly order this again. The food doesn't take very long once ordered and the people who are working in the trailer are very friendly. I would recommend this food truck to anyone looking for a simple yet flavorful meal."}
{"text":"Great veggie friendly options.  Literally the best sandwich I've had in a long time. Very fresh tasting considering it is friend and coming from a food truck. I cannot wait to have this again.  (The Arepa Veggie Sandwich is everything.)"}
{"text":"I just ledt puerto rico and was already missing the food. I waa so excites he had patacones..."}
{"text":"Love their burgers! The cilantro sauce they have is addicting! First time eating it and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Really tasty empenadas, super flavorful sauces to go with it.  They also gave us a little sample of their cheese sticks wrapped in a flaky something similar to a tortilla but different from the empanada dough.  Really friendly people, great job, I'm really impressed with this one."}
{"text":"Solid value for some of the best Venezuelan food around town. The fact that it's on wheels just makes the hunt a little more thrilling.  Mr. Cooker is a Las Vegas food truck that's been around for a little over a year now. I'm surprised at how few their review count is, despite their appearances at such events as the Great American Foodie Fest, Sunset Park'd, and a Yelp Elite Event. The former two are sometimes derided for overpriced and lackluster food, which is true for some places. However, they impressed people including yours truly at the latter, which is why I was so glad to find them in the wild today.  Well, \"the wild\" in this case is the inaugural running of a weekly food truck gathering at the Total Wine & More on Las Vegas Blvd (near Fry's / Town Square), and it's more like a ring of about ten trucks/trailers/vans showed up and these guys were in the thick of it. I knew that they'd be among the best, so I couldn't pass them up as I regrettably did at other food truck events.  The man running front of house (or outside of truck, in this case) gave me a brief tour of some of their menu. I went for his favorite after finding out that I could get two different meat choices. My order of patacones ($8 for two) came out within perhaps 5 minutes still plenty hot, but I eagerly dug in to these creations of meat, cheese, and sauces sandwiched between fried, crispy plantains.  That crispness stands out first and foremost. It's not a hard crunch, and it yields something substantial in your mouth that texturally reminded me of some chicken skins that I'd recently had. Speaking of which, the meats are no slouch. The pork was great, but the shredded beef was surprisingly juicy and rich in flavor. And the slew of sauces was complementary and not overwhelming, although some areas were less sauced. Fortunately, I soon noticed that they had squeeze bottles including one that contained more of that ubiquitous green cilantro sauce. Ask for them. They're important.  I'm definitely going to revisit Mr. Cooker soon. I definitely need to try their arepas, empanadas, pepitos, and perhaps one day a traditional certain comestible, if they ever source the right corn and cheese to craft the recipe to their liking. I'll be waiting."}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent people! I was very impressed. First time I have tried Venezuelan food but I will be following the Mr Cooker truck around town! Thanks."}
{"text":"Great experience!  I was very unsure of what the food choices were and the young gentleman out front took his time and helped me understand all they had to offer.   I had the mixed panacones (one chicken and one beef).  They were excellent!  Great food truck experience!"}
{"text":"The food truck photos looked good, but the items we ordered were mehhhhhh. The best part was their cilantro sauce they had on the side.   I think the empanadas were just not that great, and their cheese filled pastry dough thing wasn't special either. I'll be taking my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Even though we only had a Beef Empanada I'm going to give this spot a five. The service was very friendly and the empanada was outstanding. I wish we had stopped back to try more of the menu. I'm glad that they are local and I can track them down another time.  The Beef Empanada packed a lot of flavor and was fresh. From the outside it looked boring, but turned out to be anything but boring. The seasoning on the bread and beef was very tasty. The bread tasted and appeared to be made from scratch. The sauce served with the empanada had a nice kick and nice flavor."}
{"text":"Fresh, delicious empanadas and arepas, Great service and friendly cooks!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best Venezuelan food I have ever tasted.  I have eaten here so many times, and every time the food is just perfect. The chicken empanadas are by far my favorite, and I love the fact that they have vegan options too."}
{"text":"Excelente comida Venezolana, lo recomiendo 100% su dueño el Sr Samuel es súper amable y muy atento con los clientes"}
{"text":"I love this food truck and the Venezuelan family that runs it! Easily one of my top 3! Delicious authentic Venezuelan food accompanied by great customer service. I have not had a single thing here that I haven't enjoyed. My favorite is the veggie patacones & my boyfriend loves the beef arepa. Their food doesn't need additional sauce but they offer it, so why not put more yumminess on top of the yumminess?! The owner says they will be serving cachapas soon...I can't wait!"}
{"text":"I finally got to try this place for the Yelp Event at the lion place! My friend had invited me to be her plus one even though I'm ELITE hahaha!  They are a food truck that serves empanadas and arepas! I only got to try the arepas but I think I ate like 5. Sober & Drunk LOL  They were literally handing them out like candy, I couldn't resist. I had 2 different variations of their chicken arepas. This place is much more authentic that Viva Las Arepas even though they are a food truck. Very clean, and friendly staff.  I got to come try their food again on a after meeting snack break and they did not disappoint. Their cilantro sauce is delicious, and their food is extremely fresh. I will be back!"}
{"text":"We went to the location in the liquor world parking lot on decatur and cactus. The girl standing outside of the truck that should've been engaging people to try their food was too busy calling people out in the crowd for how they looked and gossiping to her coworkers. And when my friend asked if they had a certain item he was informed that, 'That's not Venezuelan!! Are you one of those people that just lumps all races together!?' and when he asked how long it would take for his food to be ready, he was told to 'calm down Rick and Morty. It'll be ready soon.' (he was wearing a Rick and morty graphic tee.) I wish I could say the food was redeeming, however, after all that shitty customer service we received, they got the order completely wrong."}
{"text":"Ok. Just went to a food festival and got the pork pepito and wow was it amazing. However it took about 20 minutes to get. The daughter or someone was taking the money and she was overcharging everyone for water. There's a sign that states it's $1 and she's charging everyone $2. Her bra is hanging out of her shirt and she's very rude. She's rolling her eyes at customers. Telling customers they are \"hovering\" when they are waiting for their food and even yelled at her brother or whoever the young guy was taking orders if it was faster and she wasn't there I would have ordered a second pepito but she Ruined my experience. She needs to learn customer service skills."}
{"text":"We went to Food Truck night on Cactus Ave, and picked Mr. Cooker because they have Empanadas and you can't really find those everywhere.  I had the chicken and cheese, and my husband had the beef and cheese.  They are very big and I didn't finish mine, not because I didn't want to, but because it was STUFFED with chicken and cheese.    We both loved them, and the cilantro aioli was pretty damned good too!  I can't wait to go back in a few weeks and try the black bean Arepa sandwich and some plantains.  Pure yumminess!"}
{"text":"They had us the moment they offered a sample of the yummy Tequenos and then hooked us with their Patacones. Customer service was so friendly and attentive!"}
{"text":"Mr. Cooker is a delightful on the go eating experience. I have been to several events and come across Mr. Cooker food truck thus giving me many chances to try the: pepitos, empanadas, patacones ( chicken & beef) & cheeses balls. All where very unique in flavor & textures that left me with a great taste in my mouth each time. It's always a wonderfood experience! Please try & enjoy!  ;-)"}
