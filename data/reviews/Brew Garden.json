{"text":"The Parma location needs help, BADLY!

The menu at the Parma location has been reduced to a badly typed 3/4 page menu, from a FULL MENU!  Of course, the full menu is still on the website,misleading people.  They were out of fries, out of mushrooms, and out of wings!  The Parma location has repeatedly had the worst service of any restaurant in town!  Tonight, service was terrible, even though the place was empty. Our beers sat at the bar for about 8 minutes, until I got up, walked over and got them. Ten minutes later, when the waitress returned, she said \"oh, you got your beers?\" I bit my tongue. Last time I'll be going here. This place has went downhill fast."}
{"text":"Just dropped in on a Sunday night for a burger and a beer at the bar. They only opened 3 days ago, so there are a few bugs to work out. Not with the beer though--they have a very good selection of about 20 brews on tap, most of which are $5 for a full 16 ounce pint. Happy hour prices are only $4.

The restaurant is an attractive physical space--spacious large booths and a nice bar area. They'll eventually have a huge  outside bar and patio overlooking a small lake. An excellent venue , given it is next to the Southpark Mall parking lot. I would expect this place to be busy during the summer. 

The burgers were juicy and tasty, although the food took quite a while, and our bill wasn't correct,  but we figured these were just opening week bugs. The menu also featured plenty of salads, sandwiches, wings and even some nicely prepared street tacos. We'll be back, and hopefully  be upgrading this review to 5 stars."}
{"text":"First off, huge place!  If the parking lot looks full, it's not crowded .  Good but not great beer selection.   Cleveland breweries not even on the radar here.  Very disappointing!  Come on Brew Garden!  Service was pleasant and prompt.   Finally, the reason we came here was to eat.  Food was COLD!  I mean everything!  Again, very disappointing!  We most likely will not be back.  Too bad because we really wanted to like this place.  Recommendation?  Find quality kitchen help and pay them well!  It'll pay off tenfold!!  You can't live on beer and a nice place alone!"}
{"text":"My group of Parma friends were hopeful to make the Brew Garden our new regular watering hole. The Blue Moose which previously occupied the venue hosted a generic infestation of Miller Lite-drinking douchebags listening to Nickelback, so of course we avoided that.

But with new management bringing in a detailed craft beer list (incl. size, ABV), a solid menu of restaurant-quality food, and some actual rock & roll, all at a convenient location, it sounded too good to be true. Unfortunately it was.

Our group was there for opening night, where I ordered the Lobster Mac & Cheese sandwich and a couple snifters of Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale. All delicious, all at a great price (most beers $3-5-ish as Mike B says). Finally, an American-style pub that didn't suck!

Unfortunately as my friends have gone back, week after week, the service has steadily grown worse, and the beer list and menu have diminished. It's far too common to sit for 25 minutes without a brew; most of my pals just walk up to the bar because they know waiting at the table is fruitless. While the menu options are great compared to most bars in the area (e.g. walleye sandwich with garlic aoli, yes please), Brew Garden has increasingly cut back on the choices.

Most recently I was there around 8PM on a Thursday (a rare chance; I'm usually busy with a volunteer job). I was hungry and aching for a pint with my pals. The waitress/bartender (I'd call it understaffed but there were only a dozen customers, half of them in my group) dropped me a beer list which was only half of what they used to offer, with lots of choices scratched out or overwritten in pen. She came back 60 seconds later and I told her my choice (an oatmeal stout), but she said that one was out of stock too. I'd need a few more minutes to decide. But then I didn't see her again for well over 20 mins. No, she wasn't busy; I watched impatiently as she putzed around behind the bar and clicked through TV channels.

I asked my buddy at the other end of the table for a menu, and he gave me a paper sheet instead of the usual booklet. Where'd all their awesome sandwiches go?  8PM on a Cleveland bar night and apparently all they offered was very ordinary burgers (lettuce, tomato, ketchup), wings, boring pizza (just plain or pepperoni), or nachos. I could get that same fried crap at any old dive. So I sat a while longer, bored and sober, until I couldn't take it. Why did I bother coming? Why did my friends bother? I guess they've resigned to the fact that that there are still no better pubs nearby.

Hungry and annoyed with the lack of service and appetizing food options, I left, vowing to catch up with my pals later.

It's a shame too, because the venue is great, with a large bar, solid tables, plenty of TVs and a projector, an open floor area for bands, and a great patio with its own large bar. With good food, good, beer, and good prices, it could be fantastic... but it's all marred by consistently bad service and steadily diminishing options."}
{"text":"Place is big, alot of of craft beers but alot of bars have that. Food was good but nothing special. Bar food, but alot of bars have that. I'd go again but I wouldn't go out of my way. The place is average. Bar service was terrible."}
{"text":"I don't mind a good late night food dig, the food was great. The hostess was very attentive and so was the server. No complaints, the music choices could be immensely better & so could the tv. Who wants to watch the news on a Sunday night at 11pm & fight night. When there are far more things sports wise going on! I wish there were a few more menu options especially for people with food allergies!"}
{"text":"Witness  the best waitress get harassed by a middle age rude lady over berries and beers brewed on site. Where was management?. Now the best waitress is gone. Bad for business!!"}
{"text":"I've came a handful of times. Each time I waited on the long side for service. Tonight we were sat at a table by the smokers with food menus and that was it. No drink menu. And that was the last time we heard from anyone. After about 20 minutes of everyone around us getting waited and not us we left. Sad to say I don't think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"Place is big , new, and attractive. Food and service sucks. Floors inside are very slick . Much better off going to Brew Kettle or Johnny J's."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had in my life. Jocelyn the sever was clueless and the manager had no clue what he was doing to resolve the situation. I watched 8 tables leave within three hours. Get ur together"}
{"text":"Very good atmosphere, especially for the big games. Enjoyed much of the Cavs title run here.
Good service, food isn't bad either."}
{"text":"Extremely noisy with lots of kids & bad service. 1st & probably the last time I will go there ."}
{"text":"Been here 6 times now, great looking place. Unfortunately the worse service possible my friends and I have ever received. Bartenders walked passed a group of us at bar on a slow Saturday afternoon didn't even acknowledge us. They did manage to clean the glasses around us from customers who had left but didn't acknowledge us was the biggest problem. We are just looking for a bar to get drinks with service!!"}
{"text":"Been here a handful of times and service is terrible. Took me about ten minutes in an almost empty bar to get a drink. Wow! That's pretty pathetic. Hope things improve or this one will be toast soon too.
Bartenders that did finally help me had attitudes and you had to flag them down. Really? That's the way to make people come back. And leave you a decent tip???
Will be a little while before I go back. Very disappointed once again."}
{"text":"1. Food is overpriced.  2. Food wasn't all that good. 3. You do not get a lot of food for the price. 3. My husband had a very long hair in his cold pork tacos.  We will never ever go back. We were both so disgusted with the long hair that he pulled out of his mouth while chewing his measly two tacos.  I ordered the blue cheese burger. It was good but for 11.00 it should come with fries and not the little skinny ones that are in a little cup for an extra 1.50. Compared to the Brew Kettle this place doesn't stand a chance."}
{"text":"Bartender \" forgot \" to bring my change tonight. Insisted he did. No problem, a once and done. Called to talk to a manager, hung up the phone, no problem. A once and done!!!"}
{"text":"I had dinner and a beer with a group of coworkers.  The service was unfortunately very lacking but it seems like the place just opened within the past month or so, so hopefully it's something they work out.  The food was average and overall I'm not sure I would hurry back."}
{"text":"The place is huge and obviously brand new so the decor is nice. They have two full bars, one that appeared to primarily serve the outdoor seating, with an additional bar inside for the rest of the restaurant. There is so much seating I doubt there's ever a really long wait at the door. Great selection of beers. Has live music every Sunday night on the patio

Not better than any other chain bar tho (BW3, etc...) and expect to wait for service. The bartenders were working so hard, but there was only so much to do when it's clearly understaffed. Unfortunately, this place really doesn't do anything too much different than a lot of other chain style bars/restaurants. 

Oh and it's not on a lake. That's been a water retention basin for the mall since I can remember."}
{"text":"So disappointed in the food here. The patio is great but the food was skimpy and tasteless. The chicken was half the size of the bun it can on and the cheese on the nachos was cold and hard by the time it came out."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Brew Garden 4 times - and have really enjoyed all the meals.  The restaurant is very pretty inside and outside is an amazing patio with live music!  I would recommend for a fun night out - you can't go wrong with all the beer choices either!  I love the pretzel appetizer.  The burgers are yummy.  The salads are also great."}
{"text":"Somewhat decent food.  Overpriced version of Applebee's.  I would go back to try again even though our server was terrible.  She may have brought the whole experience down.  Atmosphere was great, but left very disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"For somewhere called the brew garden the beer selection was absurdly limited. On top of that the food was on par with the quality of an applebees if not worse and the service was an actual nightmare. In a table of 5 not a single order was correct and it took around 15 minutes to get a beer on a night that wasnt crowded"}
{"text":"Ate lunch here. Very good burgers. The ambiance is great. They spent a lot of money on the building. Tons of seats inside and out. Beautiful patio. Many tvs in side for games. Very nice place. A recommend trying it. Great menue. Good food portions."}
{"text":"Pretty good selection of beer. Not really a sports bar... 5 TVs, 4 on the same station (OK and Texas Tech basketball) and the other on the Penguins game. Ummmm, how 'bout the Olympics, even if on 1 TV...Only happens every 2 years.  The \"Cleveland Press\"...where was the beef?  Beer was good, though."}
{"text":"One of the biggest sports friendly bars in Strongsville, and soon to have the largest outside patio in Northeast Ohio.  The bar and restaurant opened on Friday, March 11, 2016.  The patio is expected to open in early May and it is freaking huge!  Expected to seat over 200!  

Located on the property for Southpark Mall, if you're coming from Route 82, go South on Howe Road and enter at the second mall entrance.  You will be using the right lane on Howe Road that prior to Brew Garden opening, was only used by the jerks that live south of here trying to pass all of us locals on the right before Howe Road cuts down to 2 lanes.

If you've been to the Brew Garden in Middleburg Heights, you will recognize the menu and beer selection, as it is the same.  There are 30 craft beers on tap in an island bar that seats 40+ people.  Add in 7 high top tables and 6 booths, you've got a hell of a bar which can easily hold over 100.  

The 'dinning room' doubles the size of the place, and there is a private room that makes it one of the largest bars in Northeast Ohio.  I've already mentioned that patio, which is unbelievable large and set up to be a 12 month venue.

There are 6 flat panels over the bar, measuring 60\" each.  There are also 2 projection TVs over the dinning room measuring about 12 feet across!

I was in on opening night, again on Saturday, and today, a Monday.  Nice crowd, friendly service, good food and great beer.  Kyllan took care of me at the bar and was pouring me as many Laguanitas IPAs for $4 as I could drink and still make the 3.1 mile trek home.

This is a great addition to Strongsville and a place I'm sure you'll want to come back to."}
{"text":"I'll start off this review by saying this new building is beautiful and so is the patio. Next the food, it's basically typical overpriced bar food. Nothing was bad, but it was nothing that I have to go back for. Especially when the pretzel bread app was pre cooked and reheated in the microwave. And we know it was because it was hard as a rock. And finally the service, it started out good. But our waitress disappeared after we got our food. Rick had to ask a manager that walked by for more salad dressing. We were ready to go and I was about to hunt her down for the check. When we got the check, 2 off the 3 happy hour beers did not come up the correct price, but we were sick of waiting for her and wanted to leave. We might be back for a beer on the patio, but I'm not in a hurry."}
{"text":"Went here on a recent weekday for lunch with work colleagues.  Many other Yelpers got this one just about right...pretty standard pub grub style fare and most of it average at best.

We sat outside on the patio with this streak of nice weather.  The place (inside and out) is huge...lots of seating options to choose from.  Our server was nice enough, but somewhat disappeared after she took our order and delivered our meals.

I ordered their Great Lakes fish fry, which was cod fish-n-chips with fries and cole slaw.  The meal came with two large fish filets that had a mildly greasy taste to them but the meat was flaky and fairly moist.  The tartar sauce had garlic in it and had a nice tang to it.  Unfortunately, the fires were on the underdone side.  Their house cole slaw was an unusual blend of vegetables (not just your typical cabbage, carrots, etc.) which was crispy and fresh, but the dressing had an odd flavor to it that i could not put my finger on.

My co-workers seemed to enjoy their meals, but no ohhs & ahhs when they finished.

If you are looking for a ton of big screen TVs to watch the game and/or a nice patio setting where you don't even realize you are in the Southpark mall parking lot (they did a great job disguising their location!) then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Went there to watch the browns but they didn't have the sound working.   Beer was flat.  Food was passable.   I will find another place to watch a game."}
{"text":"You know, sometimes this place is really good and then others it's just OK.  Not sure if it's the staffing on a particular day, because even the food sometimes is hit or miss.  I do like some stuff on the menu and will give it another try."}
{"text":"Brew Garden should win an award... For the most amazing looking restaurant with the absolute worst service, food, and management that I have seen anywhere in the continental United States; at least in recent memory.  

First, the good: beautiful location and build-out. The spacious interior is well designed and appears to be well kept. Bathrooms were clean. That's about where the good ends for me.

Keeping this review short, at Brew Garden the food is extremely overpriced for what it is: essentially bar food with a bit of garnish but you know darn well it came from Sysco. Between $12-15 for sandwiches that come with chips, and fries are an upcharge... This is just tacky. Give the people who were kind enough to take a gamble on your $13 sandwich some damn fries. 

On our most recent and probably final visit, our server would disappear for 20+ minutes at a time, completely overlooked empty glasses, and was entirely unapologetic until we had finally had enough and asked for our checks. We actually had to ask for someone to find our server twice, and both times no one really seemed to care. Looking around the restaurant that evening, it seemed as if most other parties were having a similar experience. Very sad for a Friday night.  The food was dry, boring, and most was left unfinished on the table.  Not once were we asked how we liked our meals.  We were just all ready to get out of there at that point, so we paid our bills and left.

If the service were good (adequate even), I could see this place getting between 2 and 3 stars tops. Sadly, it is not and totally deserves nothing more than a single star for appearances."}
{"text":"GREAT atmosphere and patio coming soon.. Great beer selection & addition to Strongsville area and walking distance from my house!! Def be back soon."}
{"text":"this place is gorgeous inside. however, the food was, to me, not that great. it wasn't even really bad but wasn't anything special. 
our pretzel appetizer seemed ovbiously microwaved as they were supposed to be soft but were tough as hell to bite through. 
Danielle's tacos were more spicy than she'd anticipated but weren't really bad. 
i ordered wings and a salad. the hot wings looked to have been sitting around a while. they looked bone dry until picked up from the plate. then under the wings was pooling sauce. they tasted fine but just weird to look at. my salad was fine but was mostly limp cooked diced bacon, tomato and cucumber. the amount of greens was sadly miniscule and the marinated chicken tasted weird to me mixed with the salad and dressing.
the service started fine but then our server (Meeka) seemed to have found something better to do than her job and disappeared for most of the rest of our visit. when she did walk by she wouldn't even acknowledge us until we finished eating.
also, were were told it was happy hour and draft beers marked HH were $4 but we ordered 3 of these beers and were billed, $4, $4.50 and $6.00 so why bother? 
it's a new place. maybe we'll go back. Danielle's father raved about it when he went so maybe we just had an off night. we'll see."}
{"text":"We have gone here 2 X's in the past 3 weeks. The 1st was with a group total of 6. Tonight it was just 2 of us. Service was decent, seated right away even though parking lot was full, but I had to wait 9 minutes for my salad entree after everyone else got their hot entrees. Tonight, service was poor at best. They were not as busy, our waitress was short and unfriendly. We sat outside and there were bird droppings on the table that I asked to be cleaned. Her response was I suppose. My husband ordered a beer, asked me if I was having one and I declined, rather than asking me what I wanted she walked away and brought back his beer and said r u ready to order.
I ordered the Strawberry salad with chicken and I do think it is excellent. My husband was not impressed with the Cuban sandwich.  He ordered a 2nd beer, she brought it back, dropped off check and didn't ask me if I would like my drink refilled.  Not certain we will give it a 3rd chance. Also, I will note parking lot was filled first visit. We parked at mall. They have a shuttle, but was told it wasn't running because they were too busy. IMO, that's when it needs to run, when there is no parking in the adjacent lot."}
{"text":"Have eaten here twice.  First time waited 10 minutes to take drink orders.  We sat at one of the high tables.  We had the TBA sandwich which was very good and sweet potato fries, which were also delicious.  We sat at a booth.  The backs of the booth were not \"fixed\", so when the person on the other side moved the whole seat back moved.  This was annoying. Will not sit at a booth again.  Our second visit we ordered beers and the waitress brought us the drinks in plastic cups (we were seated inside, not patio). We commented and she offered to put them in beer glasses.  Said that the bartender somehow thought that we were seated outside.  We ordered the blackened chicken tacos which we enjoyed.  We do like the decor, large tv's, Windows, etc...  Hope that they work the bugs out because it has a lot of potential."}
{"text":"After waiting a hour and a half to be seated when it wasn't that busy - being told that the kitchen \"needs a break\" - we finally sat and about another half hour got our food. My husbands plate looked like something off the kids menu. Portions were so small he was finished eating within 5 mins before anyone else. I got the chicken tacos. Chicken was cold, tortillas tasted like Wal-Mart packaged tortillas- which I buy all the time so I'm familiar with the taste. Tortilla chips were cold. Our friend ordered root beer..didn't have it. Dr. Pepper? Nope. Coke?? NOPE! Finally just settled with a Pepsi. We got there at 7pm and didn't leave until 10pm. The patio wasn't finished so everyone was smoking cigarettes out front as people were walking in and out. It's clear this place wasn't ready to open yet but they did anyway. Don't let the big nice building fool you. It's a glorified dump. I'll never come back again."}
{"text":"Pretty good food,  friendly & nice atmosphere!

This Brew Garden (newer eatery in Strongsville..previously I've been to the Bagley Rd location). 
We tried for dinner a few weeks after opening.  \"very nice and large open atmosphere\" set-up with old barn-wood type décor & tall windows.With the high ceilings it still seemed noisy.
The parking lot seemed crowded but there were plenty seats inside...except for the bar!

The 4 of us had a 1/2 hr wait. Our server was a charm.  
For a appetizer, we ordered the pot Stickers which were great but it seemed not enough for sharing....and they were small. 

The menu was limited ... we got a variety as a group. The Burgers were prepared perfect. 
Our guest with the fish fry (cod) was very happy with the portion. 
  
The prices were not real expensive (my limit for this kind of place).   (casual atmosphere with multiple levels and extremely   large screen TVs. There looks to be the set-up for an outdoor patio at some point.  I may try it again."}
{"text":"First off, the food was great. However, everything else was a joke. Waiting for a table takes a stupid amount of time. When a tables ready they text you and allow 8 mins for person to respond  (I asked for the time period). This has let SO many tables sit for such long periods without patrons. I feel horrible for the servers. The wait was 1 hr and could have been much faster with a different seating system. The front desk crew of 4 women were rude and joking about people getting upset at seeing empty tables. I have been at my table for 50 min (about to leave now) and there is a 6 top that has been empty this entire time. Another 3 tables sat for over 30 mins without people. Again, I feel bad for the servers."}
{"text":"Drove to strongsville w Jennifer to get some shoes and went to Yelp for our food options. We finally settled on this after debating the reviews. The look is much like other restaurants with this theme. 

They were fairly steady for a lunch rush. The server was friendly and interacted w is as we had Jenns niece w us. I also love the menu options for a bar. Burgers, sandwich, and the normal bar options. Our appetizer was the pretzels with a bitter dipping sauce that was good and a beer cheese that was also tasty our so we thought.more on this later.

I got a pretzel chicken with a mustard Ina brioche bun. One problem it was chewy, not just any chewy chewbacca chewy. Either it wasn't pounded or cooked properly but it shouldn't crunch when I bite into it. I also want fries not chips with my meals and restaurants that do this annoy me. 

Jennifer got an Leau sandwich with pineapple and didn't like it. Said it was bland with huge fatty pieces. Overall for the price and bland taste it was below average. I think this place has potential and I like their menu for the price and quantity and presentation is lacking and vanilla. I will try this agin but it will be awhile. 

Oh yes we thought we like those sauces on those pretzel appetizers. We were driving back to our house and we both had heart burn this symptoms this wouldn't be to concerning except I have never felt that was before. It doesn't happen to Jennifer often either. That is the only common variable we had. Shrugs be careful here"}
{"text":"Sat. Night very crowded but I hear it's crowded every night. About a 20 min. wait at the patio bar til we got seated. We ordered the Loaded Skillet Tots, 2 Cleveland Press(Prime Rib), the Luau(pulled pork w/pineapple) and the Bar Steak. Everything was delicious.
 The Portside Breakwall Brown Ale and Platform Speed Merchant IPA are both great beers on tap.
 The place is still under construction, no outdoor patio yet. In the early evening the sun bursts thru the glass windows totally nullifying the 2 large screens on the opposite wall and also causing a problem for diners.Which I sure will be addressed in the future."}
{"text":"Tasty affordable food, great decor, friendly service, nice atmosphere!

Brew Garden recently opened up in Strongsville. I had never been to a Brew Garden so I was eager to try it out. We went for lunch on their 2nd day of opening. The decor is very nice: large entryway, high ceiling with gorgeous wood accents everywhere. It was like being in a large, clean barn. 

Our greeter was friendly and we were seated right away, no wait. Our server, Tina, was very friendly. Drink orders were taken promptly. 

For an appetizer, we ordered the spinach + artichoke dip. It was excellent! Had a great creamy, cheesy, smoky flavor and the tortilla chips were nice + thick. 

The menu didn't  offer a whole lot to our tastes. Lots of burgers, pizzas and sandwiches. We ordered the Faroe Island Salmon and the Shrimp Street Tacos. 

There was some confusion with the salmon order. Our server asked what side we wanted, so we said broccoli. Then she came back apologizing because she realized it only came with noodles and a side wasn't included. We said to add the broccoli as an extra side then. When the salmon came, surprise, no noodles?!  We asked the server + she said this is how it was prepared, but she'd check (keep in mind they had just opened for business the day before) Not sure what happened with the noodles but they agreed to not charge us the extra for the broccoli. 

The shrimp tacos were tasty, but the portion was a little small. It came with salsa and tortilla chips but as I had already had these same tortillas with my appetizer, I didn't really feel like eating anymore of them. The salsa could've been better. 

For drinks, I ordered the Bloody Effen Mary which came without the lime, celery and \"zesty rim\" it had advertised. I pointed this out to our server. She offered to bring me lime and celery but I said it was OK, not to bother.  It's more part of the presentation of the drink, so the moment had already passed.  No big deal but I had been looking forward to the \"zesty rim\" whatever that was!

The prices were reasonable. Most entrees were $12 to $17, I think. Our appetizer was $10 and the cocktails were about $7 each.

Dress is casual.  Most diners were in jeans, sweatshirts and sneakers. The atmosphere is nice: many large screen TVs (lots of college hoops on the day we visited) and everything is made of wood. 

Miscellaneous:

There is lots of parking available. 

I was told they do not take reservations. 

Free wifi!

Conclusion: yummy food, nice drinks. Good service and affordable prices. They are very new at this point and a few things were forgotten/omitted from our orders. But hopefully they'll get into a regular routine soon."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times since it opened with various friends and family members that wanted to go.  The restaurant is very new and pretty inside.  Lots of TVs, two large bars, and best of all, tables and chairs for those who are waiting for a table.

The service has always been good, even if the employees look a little overwhelmed.  There are always lots of customers, but don't worry: there are lots of parking spots.   I really like the wait app and that they text you when your table is ready.  The wait on Saturday evenings has been about 45 minutes - 1 hour. It helps to go to the bar and get yourself a reasonably priced drink.  :)

I do not recommend bringing children here during busy hours.  I saw A LOT of unhappy campers, even with their sodas and electronic devices, throwing fits about the wait each time I went.

The menu is the same as the one in Middleburg Hts.  There is something for everyone.  I love the mac-n-cheese skillet - especially the pretzel bread it comes with!  People I went with also loved the chicken tacos and TBA sandwich.  The loaded tater tots are AMAZING and cooked perfectly!  I also had the veggie/hummus platter.  I would say all of their apps are big enough for 3-4 people to share."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere and great food. Big screen tv that you can see from pretty much anywhere you sit in the main room. Bartenders are very friendly and servers are friendly and efficient. The nachos are really good ."}
{"text":"Food is ok, standard american choices, quality was average.  Service at this location, aside from our waitress Maddie, was HORRIBLE!  We were quoted a 45 min wait, but instead stood unattended in the lobby entry for over an hour.  Everyone who came in before and after us, was seated, while the terrible blonde hostess just kept saying i'm sorry no one is leaving, you just have to wait.  All she did was play with and reference her touch screen contraption, and basically could not make a human choice, decision or action without it.  The hostess staff never asked how we were while waiting as long as we did, nor did they make any effort in this enormous location to creatively come up with seating, putting tables together for the 6 of us - nothing.  After over an hour, we prompted the hostess staff to split us up at booths we saw empty out, to avoid any further wait.  The young staff was running around with one another joking, laughing, while customers just waited and looked on.  They seemed to be having fun.  The manager even socialized with the hostess staff, and frequently passed and just looked onto the waiting group of customer.  Not sure he cared.  Never a comment from him either during the hour plus wait.  If you have long waits, tend to the people waiting a little - check in, direct them to the bar, ask if they need anything.  Without us, your customers, you won't have paychecks - would be in your best interest as a service provider, to at a minimum, satisfy us, your customers.  A  table opened within minutes of us asking to be split up.  You think the intelligent hostess, or her uninteractive manager would have come to move us there, NOPE - they were seating the next group.  Work on you staff Brew Garden.  I know they are young 20 somethings, but they are the face of your business, especially the hostess staff at the front door, and the management.  Ask them to act like humans with brains, whose job is to service and please the other humans who walk in the door, and not just come to work to hang out with other staff, have fun and depend entirely on their electronic contraptions to tell them what to do next.  I doubt I'll ever go back to this location.  We live in a foody town with tons of amazing choices with true food quality and service.  This is nowhere near a fit in that statement.  To Maddie, the waitress, thank you for being the only one who made things happen and actually got us into a large booth together before our food was served."}
{"text":"Great wings and pork tacos.  Avoid booth tables because they are rather thin and light you feel every movement of the people behind you."}
{"text":"First time here and we sat at the bar because I like the service better. They had great porters on tap and the menu had a variety of options to choose from. We were in a rush and just ordered the lobster bisque that had raw onions in the soup. My husband hates raw onions and that put him off sadly. Aside from being an onion hater we so much enjoyed the nachos and balsamic romaine salad. I left happy!!"}
{"text":"Had the fish  and sweet potatoes. Great and our server Mary was the best/ very attentive !"}
{"text":"We always have a nice time there. We've held several parties there and they always accommodate...love the patio!"}
{"text":"Our server, Lauren, was awesome! Very friendly & attentive! The food was ok. Dry rub wings were covered in the rub.....way too much seasoning. Spinach artichoke dip came out cool. Lauren happily took it back and brought it out warmed up. Overall, the food was mediocre but Lauren made up for it."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was very nice, beautiful building. I order the buffalo chicken mac-n-cheese (from the entree section of the menu) and it came in the same size bowl that my Husbands side of kettle chips were in.  $13 for a side portion of Mac-n-cheese. Way overpriced for what you get. Go to Two Bucks instead and pay 1/3 of what you would pay at this place for the same thing."}
{"text":"Walked into the restaurant at 3pm. Before I could ask for a table for four, the group of 4 servers doing nothing said food service will take more than an hour due to problems in the kitchen. We walked out. For a new restaurant this is a poor start. Will not return there again."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant and patio! Food was fresh and tasty. Our waiter Kellen was very efficient, and full of personality? One of the best servers I have ever had at any restaurant. Over all an A++ experience."}
{"text":"Their menu is deceiving.  They describe chorizo and bratwurst on their menu, but the same \"country sausage\" is used in both.  In the mag and cheese with chorizo the sausage is cut up patties from the bratwurst sliders.  They use fake bacon on their salads.  The short ribs are mystery meat and not short ribs at all.  The food is disgusting and I will never go back and will verbally warn others to stay away."}
{"text":"This is a really fun bar restaurant.  But we sat at the bar tonight, and literally had to wave our hands for a couple of minutes to get anyone to pay attention to us. It was normal busy, not crazy busy. But they never looked in our direction. 
Only one time in 3 hours did 1 of the bartenders come up and ask if we need anything. Every other time, we had to work hard to flag somebody down. Other patrons around the bar were laughing at us, at how much work we had to put into getting attention.
 I ordered the bowl, with carnitas and salsa. It was lukewarm when it got to me. Probably had been left sitting for a while on the counter.
 Over all it was very disappointing."}
{"text":"Beautiful place, good food, great beer selection & an awesome atmosphere! Service was good too! Great addition to Strongsville."}
{"text":"I've always driven near Brew Garden in Strongsville when I head up to the mall, but I finally had the chance to stop in and grab dinner with my family on a Sunday evening. 

Huge dining area with a great patio! They had the garage doors open, allowing fresh air to come in. I loved how spacious it is! I personally had the Titan Burger, which was really tasty! Medium well was just perfect, as it was topped with caramelized onion, fresh onion, lettuce, tomato, and a sweet sauce of some sort. I would recommend that for anyone who is hungry for a filling meal. We also ordered their special for the night, the Plain Jane Pizza and whole set of traditional wings for $15 only!! Definitely a great deal and enough to feed two adults. 

We had a great server, who was extremely patient and friendly, which made our first experience at Brew Garden so much better! Thank you for the great food and atmosphere! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Some friends recommended Brew Garden to us recently and we really like it here. We have since been back twice and have had good experiences each time. They have a huge beer selection, full bar and an excellent food menu to choose from and a Large outdoor patio. Great place for diiner and drinks! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I never write reviews, but this place was SO BAD that I feel the need to share my experience. My boyfriend and I went here last Saturday after going to the one in Middleburg a month ago for a cornhole tournement. I'm a vegetarian and the online menu and menu at Middleburg had many options for me. We walked into the Parma location and it was a ghost town, no one in the front to greet us. Walked to the bar where two other couples were sitting and NO BARTENDER to be seen! After a few minutes the girl came and got our drink orders and we asked for menus. She hands us a laminated piece of paper. Front side only. Burger, wings, pizza, nachos. That's it. I said maybe we should go somewhere else to eat and she replied \"i don't blame you.\" WHAT???!! Ordered shots, she disappeared for 10 mins til she finally came back and brought our shots. She also overcharged our beer a dollar. We paid our tab and left. Went to Red Circle to eat and drink where we were taken very good care of!! Never going back here!!!! You have all been warned!!!!"}
{"text":"This is of the newest additions to Strongsville's bar scene. Your patio is amazing and they have two bars and a huge space for tables. To be a great place to catch a game as there's tons of TVs and projection on the walls. They have an extensive beer and speciality drink list, you're sure to find something you like. Have some great happy hour specials with five dollar appetizers. Best thing we got was the pretzels with beer cheese and stone ground butter. Spider was sweet and so delicious. Rest of the food was super average. I also got the shrimp tacos which were bland and cold. Others were unimpressed with their food as well. 

All in all great patio for the nice weather and a fun place to grab a drink, but I don't know that I'll be back for the food anytime soon."}
{"text":"The patio outside has all been redone. It's really nice. A new outside bar was added. New seating including several booths that look to be very big. I did not notice but would be nice if they had a fire pit area with seating. I was impressed."}
{"text":"beer gardens are the best types of gardens! FUC yeah!

there's a giant outdoor patio with a bar that - and I am not joking - takes up a space bigger than some restaurants here in New York. tons of seating around it, as well as enough tables and chairs to fit a medium-sized raging Viking drinking party. and the indoor drinking area is quite spacious too. 

the selection of beers - and their prices - is wonderful. glasses/pints/snifters of delicious craft brews will run you, on average...3 to 5 bucks! YES, YOU READ THAT CORRECT. a few options are costlier - large bottles such as Arrogant Bastard, Fin Du Monde, and such will run you 10-12 dollars. domestic drafts are in the range of 2 to 5 bucks. they even have Six Point, the unofficial beer of Yelp NYC events!

copies of the beer list are on all the tables. prices, alcohol percentage, category, and a brief description of the beers will aid you in your quest to board that train to Drunktown!

it was kind of empty on Friday, but then again it was Labor Day weekend and a bit earlier in the night. service was pretty good, could've been a bit faster but they were quite friendly.

had a great time here. definitely a fun spot to relax and drink some good beers for cheap!"}
{"text":"Been here twice. First with a friend and her parents second was with another friend and her current bf. I ordered the mac and cheese dish they had and we all shared an appetizer loaded tots which basically was your average tator tots with stuff on top. Meh. The mac and cheese wasnt the best but it was terrible either. The waitress was rude and dressed like an escort or adult entertainer. I thought this was a restaurant not a nightclub.. Some other people might not have minded but I came here to eat and not to see the waitresses chest and body on display. Not classy at all for a place that looks fancy."}
{"text":"First visit to this new restaurant in Strongsville. The service was excellent! They were very accommodating when I requested a change in the preparation of a sandwich. We will return!"}
{"text":"New to Strongsville, food was subpar. I had the shrimp tacos as did my friend. Shrimp was neither cold nor hot so not sure what they were going for. Other guests at the table had the Chicken Caprese sandwich and the black bean burger, neither of which were good. Bartender was efficient as was the waitress. This place has a lot of competition for bar food in this city so they should step up their game if they want to compete and stay in business."}
{"text":"The new patio is AMAZING! The food; not so much. I've been here a number of times and have never enjoyed my meal or apps. From frozen tater tots to broken spinach and artichoke dip, from cold fries to dry BBQ pork sliders; it's consistently below average. 

Notwithstanding the subpar food, the beer selection is really good offering both a selection of micro brews and domestics. The service is hit or miss, but April was great on the patio. 

This will likely be a normal spot for me this summer just because of the patio. If it wasn't for that, I would most likely skip this place altogether. They really need some help in the kitchen, I think."}
{"text":"Went specifically to watch the Browns game because we had heard about the nice outdoor space, which _was_ nice. We were SHOCKED when the manager wouldn't change the channel in front of us at the bar (4 of us total with NO ONE BEHIND US) to the Browns game at kickoff. His excuse?!?  \"A lot of people play fantasy football and may want to see how their players are doing\". An associate got the channel changed right then just as he was LYING to us that he couldn't do it or it would change other tv's. He sheepishly walked away, then after 5 minutes the tv was turned back to the Houston/Chicago game. I would AVOID any restaurant where the customer is not always right. ESPECIALLY A NEW RESTAURANT AND ON BROWNS SEASON OPENER IN CLEVELAND!!!!  I will note that the bartender was great and extremely apologetic, but unfortunately when you put idiots in charge, you get more idiot than anything. Diner beware!"}
{"text":"We were seated within 10 min on a Fri night, just in time for the the 2nd round of the NFL draft and game 6 of of the NBA playoffs. Food was good and the waiter made sure to keep the drinks coming."}
{"text":"I have been here as well as to the Middleburgh Heights location numerous times. I will start by saying they have changed their menu in the past year and I think it got smaller and lost a lot of great items off of it. The new Strongsville location is huge inside and also has a really large outdoor patio. I will say this is one of the best outdoor patios in Strongsville. 

The food here is alright, nothing out of the ordinary. It's your typical bar food. Where they could use improvement is on the service. It seems like nobody was trained or if so not very well. The food takes a long time from when you order it and it seems like multiple table's orders come out at the same time. This is one of those places you go into knowing what you are getting, but it has the potential to be better."}
{"text":"We tried their one pound wings actually 10 wings. I got the spicy garlic parmesan, my wife got the bacon barbecue. The spicy garlic parmesan were just plain wings with a little bit of cheese on them, very little cheese, no garlic and no spice. The bacon barbecue was a sweet barbecue sauce lightly covering the wings. The wings were OK. The place had a good flow of people the service was OK our waiter had way too many tables to get us good service. By good service I mean not waiting 10-15 minutes for a beer. He was hustlin no doubt about it but way too busy."}
{"text":"Really good beer selection, delicious food with large portions. Cool atmosphere. Big. Great patio with a new outside bar being put in this summer and a huge covered outdoor bar."}
{"text":"Yesterday was our third visit to the Brew Garden. The restaurant has a very inviting atmosphere. I loved the outside eating area, it was beautiful. But, the food has a lot to be desired. Overpriced, very little variety, and not very good. We have decided not to eat there again."}
{"text":"Great place for watching a game with the nice big projectors they have. Food on the other hand was average. I got the Margarita Pizza and half of it was crust. Other than that, pretty enjoyable experinenve."}
{"text":"Didn't get good service tonight :( sat at the bar and no bartender notice until after someone else sat down a ways from me. I had been sitting there for over 5 minutes with two female bartenders taking orders from people from with in inches of where I was. Then i ordered a menu item that was more then what the menu said...... least to say not pleased"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with my mom a week or so ago, and I found it creepy how dead it was inside. The restaurant is huge, and there is tons of seating. They have giant tv screens for sports, and I overall liked how this restaurant looks. The service was okay, sometimes it's hard to judge whether the servers are good or not when you're basically their only table. I wouldn't say our server or the hostess were overly friendly or welcoming. I liked the food. Nothing special, but they had a lot to choose from. Salads, burgers, wraps, appetizers, I would say it's a little step up from bar food. Overall a solid choice, but nothing really stuck out to me as being over the top. I didn't drink, but I did notice they had some drink specials pretty much every weeknight. I'd go back."}
{"text":"The decor of this place is beautiful and we loved the layout. Our server was incredibly attentive and polite. The beer list is very impressive, lots of great local stuff on tap. Between the four of us, we got bruschetta, wings, tacos and pizza. None of it was anything to write home about and everything was cold or just room temperature. The wings had almost no flavor. The soft tacos, chips and salsa all tasted like something you get at the grocery store. The pizza was equally as bland and underwhelming. The bruschetta was pretty good. Maybe we just picked the wrong food off the menu. I think we might go back just for the atmosphere and drinks. All in all, the food quality was not worth what we paid."}
{"text":"First time here! It wasn't bad. The atmosphere is a amazing. The food was good, but it was cold and my fries was cold too. I was there for my lunch break so I didn't want to send back my food. I was so hungry. But other than that my waitress was nice."}
{"text":"Checked this place out tonight. Had a great dinner. We all (5 of us) ordered different things and all were really good!! 

I had French onion soup and salad - very good soup! Hubs had meatloaf medallions - he said they were fantastic. Son in law had wings and fries-good Daughter had buffalo mac and cheese - very good. Granddaughter had kids chicken tenders which she said were \"yummy\"

We topped the meal off with dessert nachos that were amazing!!! The 5 of us shared them!! 

We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Great TVs

Very average food. Wings ordered with Korean BBQ...really? No flavor what so ever. 

And the honey Sriracha ? Really ? No flavor.

Thank goodness for blue cheese dressing to add flavor.
Word of advice...order the wings WET with sauce...otherwise they don't have flavor."}
{"text":"Wish I would have read the reviews before we went.  Good service but horrid food.  As others said, everything was cold or lukewarm.   Spinach dip appetizer was cold to touch when it arrived and meals came about 2 mins after appetizer.  Cleveland press was inedible.   Dry and burned roast beef- def. not prime rib of any quality.  Couldn't eat most of it.  Fries were nothing special for $1.50 upcharge and were just lukewarm.  Cauliflower wings were tasteless.  Avocado chicken sandwich was barely warm when served and tasteless-  no seasoning on chicken at all.  The manager was very nice dealing with our situation but unfortunately we won't be back."}
{"text":"I'm not a sports fan but have friends who are. This is a great place for all of us to go when there's a game. Not a crazy sports bar atmosphere but plenty of huge TV's to enjoy the game. Great menu and beer list. I order mussels everywhere they are offered and these are the best in the area! Order extra garlic toast to get all of the good broth. Meatloaf sliders were delicious."}
{"text":"What a beautiful restaurant! They always go ALL OUT for holiday decor as well. Fireplaces, reclaimed wood, sliding bar style private dining doors, patio, pond, well lit and inviting. The menu spans all genres and the bar is open style surrounded by seats and TVs. My wife and I are pescatarian and they have a ridculously good veg burger called the hipster and a salmon patty called \"The Slammin' Salmon\" which I hope and pray every time I order it is a reference to the broken lizard restaurant movie with Michael Clark Duncan. Do it."}
{"text":"Definitely have to upgrade my rating. I have friends in the neighborhood and have since been here a couple more times. The service was better both times, but the real attraction of this place is the food (it's a restaurant, duh). Every sandwich I've gotten here has been phenomenal. On Saturday I got their version of the club, which was among the biggest sandwiches I've ever had in Cleveland. I was tempted to ask the sever about where they get their pastrami (yes, they add pastrami to the club sandwich, along with the usual bacon and turkey) because it is absolutely among the best pastrami I've ever had."}
{"text":"I try not to write a review until I have been there more than once, usually 3 times.  And having been there several (more than 4) I can say I have never had a bad experience.  The staff is always courteous and attentive.  The menu offers enough variety that you are afraid you wish you might have ordered something else, but are never disappointed with what you did order when it comes to the table.  Overall, great service, reasonable prices and good atmosphere to watch a game."}
{"text":"If all you're looking for is a nice patio to drink on, this place will do just fine. If you're looking for good food and service as well, this place is likely to disappoint."}
{"text":"Great food. The southern tots appetizer is amazing. Huge TVs to watch the games on. Child friendly during the day."}
{"text":"No Bueno folks! Dirty bathrooms. Down right bad service. Quite pricy for such bad food. Grilled chicken and bacon was burned. Cinnamon margarita was terrible. It tasted like straight up lemon juice. The salad was wilted and warm. My water came with something floating in the bottom of the cup. The burger sucked. The only reason I give this place 2 stars is because it's kinda nice inside. Seriously just go some place else!"}
{"text":"Great location and beautiful facility.  Other than that don't expect much.  Food is very poor and you can find better quality at a fast food location.  Nice beer selection but who doesn't have that anymore.  Don't expect much besides poor service and crap food."}
{"text":"Just left after having a really terrible experience. Didn't end up eating there at all. Our time started out great with not too bad of a wait and amazing drinks. However after struggling to find options that my husband and I enjoyed we settled on pizza. They sounded great. After ordering that and an appetizer our waitress came back five minutes later to say they are out of all pizza as they are out if dough. I'm shocked a place like this at 6 on a Saturday is out of a whole portion of there menu. Her attitude was also very non apologetic more just \"pick something else\". This put quite the sour taste in our mouth and left. I will likely not ever be back."}
{"text":"I try and try to give them another chance but the service remains a huge issue.  There is no feeling that the customer matters at this place.  You
Must wait for them to acknowledge your existence and then hope they come back after the first time around.  It's poorly run and there is no sign of anyone being in charge.   Too bad.  The place looks great and the food has been decent."}
{"text":"I recently went to Brew Garden for a birthday dinner. When driving up, the location looked amazing. It was spacious, clean, and well designed. The hostess was very courteous and made sure we got a large booth outside. The lighting and decor outside was also beautiful, and the faux wood gray looking table was nice and clean. The band there was a little loud for a restaurant with a lot of families, but it was not bad music. They have 2 large bars, with plenty of staff. Our waiter was quite strange. He didn't really understand what substitutions were, and it really felt like he didn't want us to enjoy ourselves. I got the P.E.T.A. Pita, as I wanted something light but filling. I have a dairy sensitivity, so I requested hummus I had seen on another dish be put on my sandwich instead of a milky cucumber sauce. When my sandwich and extremely cold sweet potato fries (+2 upcharge for the fries by the way) honey mustard dressing was given instead of hummus! Our waiter responded with \"They both start with \"H\", I'll try to get the hummus\". The fact that he said I'll try really upset me. He definitely has no passion or good energy. My sandwich was dry, but I understand why. If I was able to eat the sauce, it would not have been. Again, the fries were tough and cold, and a fly was even in my ketchup when it came to the table. To sum it up, the restaurant is nice, the food is less than okay for it's price, and the staff is not passionate to accommodate your needs. I would probably come visit again and sit on the nice patio for an appetizer and drinks, but I will not order food again."}
{"text":"I came here for my first time and walked in and waited at the door for about 5 minutes with no hostess.  So I started walking around looking for someone to help find a seat and they directed me back to the hostess stand. Waited a few more minutes and finally got sat. 

Our server seemed overwhelmed like she had to many tables and didn't give us the best service. I tried that beer of the month and didn't like it. I asked the server if I could switch beer and she told me no problem. Once I got my bill they tried to charge me for it even though I checked with her if it was okay to make a switch and she told me no problem. Then gave me attitude once the bill came and the manager wouldn't come over to talk me which I also thought was weird. 


I will say the only reason I gave this place two stars is because the buffalo chicken pizza was amazing!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic!
We had dinner Sunday evening. We waited about 20 minutes for a table.  They texted when our table was ready. Nice feature  you can stay in the car and return emails or whatever while waiting if you choose . The place is absolutely amazing. The booth backs are  high giving a sense of  privacy and space in a busy dining  room .Gorgeous grey brick and a fire place make up the main wall and  windows are everywhere. A  patio is in the works.  The tv's are enormous  and plentiful. This place is a sports fans dream come true.  Watching the  Masters there was a real treat. The ambience is not bar like at all even though there are at least 2  separate bars inside. The food was great. Not at all standard bar food. The chicken street tacos were really good.  Spiced nicely and made with fresh high quality ingredients. The menu is diverse. The kids menu also has nice choices as well. Again higher quality than what you'd see at any sports bar type establishment. Our server, Tracy, was great. She was friendly, knowledgeable,  and super efficient even on a busy night. We never felt rushed or ignored.  This place is a must. There's nothing else even close to it anywhere around. We will absolutely be back. Again and again"}
{"text":"I have been to the Strongsville location twice now. Was super excited for the place to open, the place is beautiful with the a great big patio. But that is about it. Each time I have gone the service is terrible. They are understaffed. We waited at times over a half hour to get served at the bar. This just wasn't happening to me either, several people around me were complaining to. One couple walked out canceling their appetizer because it took over an hour! An hour for an appetizer,so imagine how long dinner took. The food is over priced and average at best. TGI Fridays is better than this place. Also for a beer garden that had very little beer selections. Again I got better beer selections at Friday's or Applebee's.  I will be surprised if this place does well once the new novelty wears off! Save your money and go somewhere else.  I normally don't write bad reviews but thought this one was necessary."}
{"text":"I used to avoid this place at all costs because every time I ate here I was less than satisfied with the food. I would only come here occasionally to have a few quick drinks with friends. Which was a shame because I love the atmosphere here! It's so nice inside and always clean. The patio is huge and it's a great place to hangout in the summer. Recently they changed their menu so I figured I would give it another shot. I got the Cantina bowl which came with cilantro-lime rice, black beans, lettuce, corn, pico, cheese and guacamole. It was very good! I was impressed. I also saw a handful of other new items on the menu that sounded yummy so I'll be back to try those. I was very happy with the change in the menu and excited to eat something with much better quality than my previous visits."}
{"text":"Great open atmosphere and both a patio and dining area inside, even though the experience was mediocre. The server was not knowledgable about the selection of wines or anything regarding food allergies, which effected the people I was with. She did not check in with us often to see how our experience was, which was concerning. Then, both appetizers were rather stale, nachos and loaded tots, and the blacked chicken tacos fell apart immediately after the first bite; disappointing. Even though they have only been open 2 months, the knowledge of their menu, which is not extensive, should have been much better."}
{"text":"Went yesterday early afternoon with the wife for lunch....

The interior is fantastic; reclaimed wood, exposed brick, cast iron street lights, tv's everywhere, etc.

We had no problems with the service - our waitress was kind and quick.

The 3*'s though is based on the food and the price.
I got a Cleveland Press (a roast beef sandwich) for $14....the sandwich wasn't very good. The roast beef had no flavor and was a bit fatty, and there wasn't much of it. The boursin cheese just overwhelmed everything and that was all you tasted. It came with a side of kettle chips which were homemade and great, but for $14 this was overpriced.
The wife got the meatloaf - the mashed potatoes and the green beans were good but the meatloaf itself was dry (only a little gravy was on it) and the bacon that wrapped it was fatty/chewy. For $15 I think expectations should be a little higher.
We looked at some app's but almost all were $9+ for basics so we didn't try.

Due to the interior and service we will be back to try again though; it's possible being the 2nd table served was a bit early for the kitchen to hit it off great so we'll give them a mulligan."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Sunday. Service and food were great! I had the salmon blt wrap with the sweet potato fries and it was fantastic! Can't wait to come back here in the summer when the patio is open."}
{"text":"I only gave this place three stars because it's a nice new place with good atmosphere, but that is where the positive ends.  The parking in woefully inadequate for the facility.  The service was very slow and simply getting drink refills took a long time.  I had the worst loaded nachos I've ever had at this place and paid too much for them.  Others with us were very unimpressed with their overpriced food as well.  The drinks were equally overpriced.  I see no reason I will ever go back."}
{"text":"A little disappointed as this was the 3rd time eating here and basically the same problem.  A real nice facility, great patio, nice bar but subpar food service.  Appetizer was late arriving and was lukewarm at best.  Loaded tots should be hot.  Then 2 of 3 dinners came about 1 minute later.  Fish and chips and Salmon burger, tasted OK, but both were barely warm.  Third dinner took about 10 more minutes (Cubano), and while it tasted good, was also just lukewarm.  Hot food please."}
{"text":"As I write this review I will point out deductions from my rating.  I'll tally them up at the end and give a final score.  Let's go!

Went to dinner tonight at Brew Garden with my wife and youngest daughter.  Arrived at about 7:00 PM.  Checked in and was quoted a 25 minute wait.  Guy wrote out by hand my name and phone number.  Said he would text me when my table is ready.

I went with my daughter to the bar to get my wife and I a drink.  My wife was holding our seats at a table in the waiting area.  I sat down at the bar with my daughter.  Bar tender came over and told my daughter she couldn't sit at the bar.  I get it.  You have rules.  My 9 year old can't sit there.  So I made her get down and stand next to me while we ordered drinks.  I am annoyed at this point.  I don't take away points for that.  Your rules.  So be it.

Once we waited about 25 minutes for a table I noticed the guy I gave my info to was gone.  There was a girl now with a Ipad checking people in.  So I walked over to check on my place in line.  Girl told me she texted me 9 minutes earlier letting me know my table was ready.  I had zero text messages on my phone indicating my table was ready.  I deduct 1 star for this.  The system in place could have had me sitting in a waiting area all night long had I not checked my place in line.  And I could have been seated 10 minutes earlier.

Morgan took care of us as our server.  She did pretty good.  My daughter ordered pot stickers.  I ordered wings.  My wife ordered a flat bread pizza.  A food runner brought us our food.  My wife said her flatbread was hot and good.  My daughter said her potstickers were just warm.  My wings were lukewarm to cold.  The skin was rubbery.  Like they had been sitting around for a while.  By the time I got to my last wing it was very cold.  I eat fast and finished first.  Morgan stopped by after our food was dropped when I started on my last wing.  She was really busy.  It took her a while to get us our check as well.  I am deducting 2 points for slow service and lukewarm/cold food.

I had 2 beers while I was here.  I've had these IPAs before and know beer very well.  They were both not fresh and malty.  These IPAs are usually very citrusy in the nose and these fell flat.  Normally these IPAs taste fresh and bitter with citrus notes and are delicious.  Here they are almost stale and malty tasting.  Someone here isn't turning over beer right.  Something is off.  I deduct 1 point.

The space here is spacious with 2 large bars.  Inside and out.  This place has a lot of potential.  Just falls flat on service and food delivery.  Overall I give them a 1/5."}
{"text":"Had a tough time with my star rating.  Food not so good, but drinks were very good. Also, has a very large and nice patio with plenty of tv's and seating for all.  In fact, it is a massive patio.
The drinks that bartender Claytin made were very good.  Real blueberries in the Fat Head's Bumbleberry beer is a plus. Also, he jazzed up the basic margarita sour mix with a little oj and sprite, so that was a hit.
Ordered Avocado Egg Rolls (Fresh avocado, napa cabbage, sriracha roasted sweet corn salsa, crispy wonton, California Ranch dipping sauce) Sounds tasty right?  Unfortunately they were greasy and did not have flavor. No ranch dip sauce.  Instead it was some sort of soy sauce?  I wound up not eating them and had them taken off the bill.  I must have just ordered the wrong thing as the place was packed. I saw mostly burgers being served, so that must be the thing to get here?
The place was very busy, but we were served pretty quickly. 
Anyway if you want to take a break from shopping at Southpark Mall, here is a spot to enjoy a cool one on a patio."}
