{"text":"My favourite place for dim sum! Some of the best dim sum chefs reside here I'm telling you!   Although the price is in the mid-high range (pretty on par with other places), everything is made delicately and full of flavour, which is where I feel they've won me over. I've had dim sum at other places where the skin/wrap on items were too thick, too hard, too dry, or lacked just a bit in flavour. This is never the case at Forbidden City. The buns are soft, pastries are flaky, and the appearance of everything is very appetizing.   I really like that they change their dim sum specials every few months to give customers different choices from the traditional menu. Recently, I tried their new green tea custard bun and it was super creamy and delicious. The wait time on weekend and holidays are quite long though so go early or try to get a reservation. It can also be a bit hard to flag down someone for service depending on where you're sitting.  Dinner here is really good too. Although it's on the pricier side, the flavours are pretty good. Depending on what you order, the portion sizes might not be what you're expecting for the price paid. They're typically not as busy in the evening compared to lunch time, but maybe that's because we usually go a bit later."}
{"text":"Strawberry Ribs.   A combination of words I never even considered would go together until I came to this delightful place. Went here with a friends to try this place as well. Something new!   The ambience in this place was great (And they didn't laugh in my face when I chickened out and asked for a fork... I tried using their chop sticks but I just couldn't perform that day, no idea why. normally I can use chop sticks!)   But my goodness, the highlight is definitely the Strawberry Ribs. It's not over-powerfully sweet, it's a perfect balance between meat and sweet. (Ho ho! That almost rhymed!)   All in all it's good atmosphere and food. Service was a little lacking, the waitress seemed over busy in there so it was a bit difficult to get extra drinks (I'm a very thirsty patron sadly!) Would recommend trying to come on a day when it's quieter there and you'll have a blast."}
{"text":"This place has pretty good dim sum for Calgary. It hit the spot for me, and everyone else I've ever brought here. The service is terrible of course - typical asian. But the quality and variety is very good! It gets pretty busy during the weekends so I try to go during the weekday."}
{"text":"Worst effin service ive ever seen but I'm sure its no surprise. Just sat there for over an hour waiting for take out yet continuously watching people come and go. Do something about your service people hire more staff if you can't keep up."}
{"text":"Can't really beat this dim sum anywhere in Calgary (unless I'm missing out on some low key spots), the place ain't so bad, Chinese people stare a lot, the food is really special and unique (it's more fresh on weekends). The waiters are always on the move so give them a break, one thing that cracks me up is that Chinese guy named \"Eric\", hahahah yeah right you're name is Eric, you don't even talk English! Anywho the food is quick, depending on your taste you probably won't like some of the dishes e.x: chicken feet, beef tripe, octopus, and so on, but once you grow accustomed you realize they ain't so bad, only bad thing I'd say about this restaurant is the fact they use so much oil and msg to cook their food, making it greasy, it's a good hang over spot to eat at when you just partied hard the night before, when coming here prepare for a knock out right after you go home. zZZZzzzzZz"}
{"text":"Came here for hotpot tonight, it was all you can eat for 23CND. Quality of meat and vegetable were really good for all you can eat. Good cost-performance. Hotpot is especially good for freezing Alberta weather. Tried the pork paste for the first time, it was tasty.   Will come here for dim sum soon and will report back.  Service wasn't bad for a Cantonese restaurant, typically, in Cantonese restaurants waiters ignore you, but at this place, they actually came around and asked us how we were doing. Plus, we negotiated and got free sweets after the meal.  Came back tonite for dinner, got the Ginger Salt Chicken Hot Pot (see picture uploaded), holy cow, it was AMAZING. The chicken was free range, thus, the meat had the \"elastic\" quality. I don't know what other words I can use to describe the texture of free range chicken. The soup had the ginsing herbal flavor which I enjoy. This dish is highly recommended by me, especially in the cold Calgary winter."}
{"text":"I quite like the food from here.  It's consistent, and the price is a tad costly, but still reasonable.  I like to sit near the entrance, as it gets stuffy when it's packed.  I've been there for all meals of the day, and it's pretty good.  They offer really good dim sum, one of the best in the city.  Parking is alright, but the parking lot can be crazy."}
{"text":"This is the best dim sum I've had in Calgary. I grew up in Toronto and really miss the selection and quality of dim sum. This is the only place I'll go when I'm here."}
{"text":"Here with family and friend (a party of 4). Be aware that the restaurant automatically charges you tips.  Service as most of the Asian community are aware, is bare minimum.  Beside I thought tips are optional based upon services provided.  RIP OFF."}
{"text":"I came here for dim sum on a weekday simply because I know I can get a table.  They have a different menu for dinner but I'm rating this purely on it being a dim sum restaurant.    It's a gong show on weekends and even though it's a large place, you won't get a table if you don't come early.  Expect them to rush you when it's packed.  Dim sum is a sit down and take your time with your friends and family meal so I don't appreciate being rushed...if I want to eat and get the hell out, I'd go for pho.  It's also pricey than most places but at least it taste good which sometimes, is worth the money but would I drive all the way here and wait half an hour to get a table on the weekend and pay the expensive price?  Nah.  I'll give this place 3 stars because it's good food, good ambiance and subpar service."}
{"text":"I was born in Hong Kong and moved to Canada when I was 2. My parents grew up in Hong Kong.  We try Chinese restaurants all over Calgary.  About 2 months ago, we were disappointed because my mom phoned the restaurant the day before to ensure a special combo they saw advertised (includes a fish dish) was available the next day. The restaurant said it was available. But when we arrived, the restaurant said that the fish wasn't delivered, so we were disappointed after driving to the NE all the way from the SW. When my parents asked if they could substitute the fish with another dish in order to still get the value of the combo, the restaurant refused, thus we were forced to choose other more expensive dishes, even though my mom was told the previous day that the restaurant could serve the combo.  The food is more expensive too. We also ordered the spicy cauliflower: After waiting for 1 hour for the dish to come, my dad asked if it was coming. The server went back into the kitchen to ask. When the server came back to us, my dad said: \"never mind, we are full enough\" but the restaurant said: \"oh, it's coming\".  But when the dish finally came, the cauliflower was still too raw so the server had lied to us when he said \"it's coming\" when the truth was that they forgot to cook the dish and then rushed it by trying to cook it after we told them that the dish never came, but then they lied to us when they said \"it's coming\" when it in fact the truth was they forgot to cook the dish in the first place."}
{"text":"Went for dim sum on a weekday. About 1/3 full of people. I noticed most were caucasians and there were very few oriental people... interesting clientele?  There was nothing to rave about. I did enjoy the deep fried beancurd wrapped fruit in mayo. It was very creative and not overly sweet. The duck tongue also had a nice texture. The deep fried tofu on the bottom was a nice touch to soak up the flavourful sauce.   I thought the seasonal veg ($5.95) was too pricey for the small serving. Overall, I found the prices were a little inflated. But then again nothing tasted horrible. Although we did return the chilled vegetarian roll as it felt slimy and tasted rotten.  I think the food was not bad, but nothing good either. Service was mediocre. Chance for a return for dim sum: maybe..."}
{"text":"Brutal. If you have any food allergies or sensitivity - don't do it!!!! First and last time going here.  The place was dead and we still had Terrible service. Our server was never around and we had to get up to find somebody before we could ask if we could order.  We have an EXTREMELY sever peanut allergy and expressed this many many times with great clarity anf detail.  Besides bringing him the wrong menu order - IT WAS FULL OF PEANUTS!!!!!  The orders that were correct weren't great. Not bad but not great. Literally paid yhe Bill  (including the ginger ale that I asked for and didn't ever get)  and went straight to A&W   You literally almost killed my boyfriend."}
{"text":"This is my fathers favorite place for Dim Sum. I have been here more times than I can count and the food is always spectacular! Very chaotic and if it is your first time for Dim Sum, I would recommend that you come during the week days vs the weekend. It is a bit more pricey than other restaurants but the food is worth the price. I have been to a lot of different places for Dim Sum and this is by far my favorite place. One thing I have heard is that the owners don't allow their waiters/waitresses to keep the tips. If that is the case shame on you! I have heard them from multiple sources. That is why your only getting 4/5 stars because those wait staff are running!"}
{"text":"Came for dim sum and it was underwhelming. They had a different twist to many of the dishes I've been accustomed to having but taste wise its just so so. Their tea comes in a clear pot though which is kind of a novelty."}
{"text":"Enjoyed dim sum.  Food was tasty and generally liked.  The portions though were universally commented on by being small.  The price did not reflect the portions.  Good food, small portions, big price.  The outside signage was non existent so for those not familiar with the location it can be difficult to find."}
{"text":"If i wrote a review before last Sunday, i would have given this place a 4 (minus 1 star for the super long hanging plastic table covers, ugh) but this past Sunday was really reaLLY REALLY disappointing. 2 stars for inconsistency and for only serving ONE dish of our order in the 40 minutes we were there. Full of excuses. we ended up paying $4.75 for the hagaw they did serve after 15 minutes.  I won't be back.  Anyway...  These guys have good dim sum. it's a la cart so your food comes out fresh and steaming hot! This was my NE dim sum spot because its usually a normally pleasing dim sum experience, sadly it ain't so anymore."}
{"text":"I am a HUGE fan of their Chinese doughnut wrapped in rice crepe with green onions...  So good~  It comes out steaming hot, and when you bite down, there is a delicious crunch.  As you keep chewing, you savor the taste of each ingredient that perfectly balance each other out.  You can really taste EVERYTHING.  Best while hot, but still good after getting cold...  It just loses its crunch.  We also got the pork dumplings, shrimp dumplings with chives, chicken feet in black bean sauce, squid in shrimp paste, rice crepe with shrimp, and a steamed bun with egg yolk custard.  I've never had pork dumplings with the raw salmon eggs, but it went really well with everything so no complaints there.  The rice crepe with shrimp was SUUUPER delish.  I usually don't like it much, but the shrimp tasted fresh and there was just enough rice crepe around it to balance the flavors.  Everything else was pretty average.  Service was good, and the restaurant was roomy!  Nice decorations, too."}
{"text":"During the weekend, please try to arrive before 11 AM to avoid long line ups, other than that their dim sum food items are recommended. The waiters/waitresses are kind, attentive and speak decent English. This place doesn't have the usual carts going around the restaurant looking for potential victims, I mean customers who would like food items in their cart. It is just filling in the paper order, handing it over to staff, and the agony of waiting and guessing of which food you ordered comes first. The food items we ordered were:  -Lo mai gai, steamed sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaf (sticky rice, chinese sausage, abalone sauce, and a quarter size egg yolk) -Shumai, steamed pork, and mushroom with shrimp on top (Use chilli oil for flavour and heat) -Jiaozi, pan fried version of dumplings (It's fried, and the dumpling wrap is a little on thick side which is common, it ain't wonton style) -Schezuan eggplant with fried pork rice vermicelli (You will like it because it's schezuan, but you can ask to make it more spicy) -Cha siu bao, steamed pork buns (2-3 bite size porky buns with pillow like texture) -Zhaliang, fried dough wrapped in rice noodle (again it's fried dough; comes with 3 sauces, soy sauce, sesame seed, hoisin sauce)  All of these food items above are recommended even for first time dim sum goer. A small tip, the stars that each food items in the order menu are based on price (higher is more expensive), not ratings or recommendations."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, half the servers were very nice ( the rest were quite impolite). Prices were comparable to other Hong Kong style cafés. Would not return, however, as my order arrived 10 minutes before everyone else's! Was only warm by the time all the food arrived."}
{"text":"Forbidden City is an excellent place to visit for lunch when in the Northeast.  Lots of parking (though it can be very busy) and lots of tables.  Order off the dim sum menu and you have piping hot yumminess on your table in no time flat.  This is an especially great place to take a group.    We end up going here for lunch at least once every week or so.    The only small downside is that the service is weird by North American standards (but not by Chinese restaurant standards).  Only certain people speak English so not everyone can help if you have questions/need water/etc.  They are very fast to bring you food, though.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Awesome food, I alway the this chain of restaurants as the owner's first rule is best ingredients and always fresh. Otherwise you get the boot.  They are almost always busy. Great for dim sum  lunch and dinner. Well worth a try in terms Chinese food.  This is Cantonese style food."}
{"text":"As a Chinese born that grew up mostly in Vancouver, I am pretty picky about my Chinese foods. Moving to Calgary had me worried about the choices here and I was right about the limited selection. Luckily there are a few gems here and Forbidden City is one of them. This is a great place to go with a group and try all sorts of different dimsum. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I went here for a late dim sum last Sunday because my normal spot, Happy Hill, was a mad house and I didn't want to wait for 45 min. We got here at it was only a 15 min wait, not bad for almost 1:30pm.   They are in line with the new Hong Kong trend of cartless dim sum, simply order what you'd like at the beginning of your meal and they bring it out to you piping hot. They also do a great job of bringing a few dishes at a time as not to overwhelm the table with a barrage of plates.   Everything we ordered was top notch and reasonably priced. The shrimp and bbq pork cheung fun (rice noodle) was perhaps the best i'v ever had, overflowing with meat and shrimp. The Shanghai soup dumplings were some of the best i've had in Calgary (WARNING: they don't call them soup dumplings...they are on the menu as \"steamed pork & veg dumplings). The shrimp and crab spring rolls were delicious! Sticky rice was superb, as were all the staples (shu mai, har gow, etc...).   The dim sum menu was extensive and there was a lot of items I wanted to try that I simply couldn't order all in one sitting. I will be back soon.  Also to note...they also seem to be big for their Hot Pot and they are currently running a special...all you can eat hot pot mon-fri 5:30 - 11pm."}
{"text":"This was my first time having Dim Sum here, and I'm definitely a fan.  Timely service. Good tasting food. I like the al a carte style vs the old cart push method. Don't get me wrong, I like tradition, but it's nice not having to wait for my food to make it's way from the other end of the restaurant.   I would have bumped my rating to a 4 star, but the rude mannerisms from the staff and manager really put me off."}
{"text":"By far the worst service in all of Calgary that I have experienced so far on my vacation. Food is not even good to cover up the bad taster of service that was given to us. The restaurant was not busy. Was not packed, so there should be no excuses for the lack of service that we got. And I only came in a party if two!   Tried it once. Will never set food back into this horrible place. DIEU LAY LOW MOW! I speak Cantonese too! Don't be talking poop about people when you don't know where they from!"}
{"text":"It seems that whenever we visit Calgary and we're in the mood for some dim sum, friends are always taking us here. It's all right. The food is nothing to rave about but it's half decent. The prices aren't that cheap at all... in fact the last time we went we paid about $90 for four people. We did have a few left overs but come on, that's pretty outrageous for dim sum. The service also sucks. There's no other way to put it. On multiple occasions they brought the wrong dishes over to our table, only to notice a few seconds later, and then took it back. Plus they basically ignore you when you need something. This can't be the best dim sum place in Calgary, can it?"}
{"text":"When I found myself infront of Pacific Plaza this past weekend, I knew I had to go in and get me some dim-sum.   There was a lineup, so we waited 10 minutes. When the lady called out \"NUMBER 80\", I let out a squeal like I had won the lottery and hopped in. YAY DIM SUM TIME!!   We ordered quite a few things. Shrimp dumplings, deep fried shrimp dumpling, rice crepe with peanut sauce, curry squid and special chicken steamed bun. Complimentary tea too, which is great. Most of the food was pretty good, but the special chicken steamed bun was a WINNER! It was so good we ordered extra!   All in all, not a bad place at all. Service is what you should expect from a typical chinese restaurant. I will be back to try the AYCE hotpot. Ooh yeah.    1/30"}
{"text":"My sister had her wedding there, and the manager was a moron. He tried ripping us off, service was horrendous. They served each person's portion at the table individually, but the servings were tiny and they didn't wrap up the rest like they should. With the wedding going on, no one at the head table had time to worry about that. With all the weddings they do, you would think they would know how to take care of everyone properly. My sister has been there 3 times in the last 2 months planning this wedding, but each time the service was bad and the manager's attitude was always horrible. If you plan a big event, be prepared."}
{"text":"When it comes to the subject of Chinese cuisine, there is so much to talk about. I love it all, whether it's a local specialty like ginger beef or something more traditional like a simple breakfast of congee and fried crullers. And don't get me started on dim sum. I can eat chicken feet, heaping bowls of noodle soup with assorted 'meat'... it's a wonderland of great tastes and textures.  Forbidden City Dim Sum seems to capture it all. It's a glorious dim sum house with a lot of fresh and well-executed items from the regular menu that never fall short. The dining area is clean and modern, always alive with activity as diners converse over steaming hot-pots or glistening plates of colourful vegetables and fried morsels of deliciousness.  The menu is a tribute to everything I love about Chinese food. It ranges from simple stir-fried gai lan with garlic to the opulence of whole abalone. I opted for some simple gai lan and the tender braised pork belly with steamed bau on this visit. I can tell you that the gai lan was bright and crisp, with the aromatics and flavour of the garlic present, but not overpowering. The fresh flavour and texture of the vegetable was done very well, not overcooked and wilted.  If you had never experienced the awesomeness of pork belly, now is the time. It is common to enjoy this cut of pork with the crispy skin and fried meat, but when it is braised low and slow with the slightly sweet red sauce, it is something to behold. It's brought to the table in a bowl with a knife. To accompany it, a wooden box of steamed bau, flattened and folded over like a taco shell for you to make the tastiest sandwich you will ever put in your mouth. Toppings are simple - a bit of chopped green onion to cut the richness of the pork and some crushed peanuts for a little texture. This style, reminiscent of the Taiwanese street snack Gua Bau is a must-have for your next visit.  Yes, I have sampled other items on the menu and they are all very good. A particular favourite of mine is the fried rice, which they add a little masago for colour and texture. It's a little detail, but its those little things that can make a dish. But when I think about Forbidden City, I will always be thinking about that braised pork."}
{"text":"Where do you draw the line between liking a place and disliking a place?  Every few Sundays I wake up, not knowing where I really am and after a few minutes of panicking I find myself in my own bed, hungover with my stomach growling like a beast and that's when I know I need some dim sum goodness.  I wait for my best friends to wake up and in a snail like fashion we slowly make our way to our favorite dim sum spot. This place I have a love/hate relationship with solely due to the fact that their service is sub par however where it lacks in service it gains in taste.  I've been to quite a few dim sum places in Calgary and I have to say that Forbidden City has to be my favorite.   We sit around, figuring out what to eat and although I don't know the Cantonese equivalents of each dish we order I can half make out the items we usually order as follows: shrimp steamed dumplings, siu mai dumplings, chinese doughnut wrapped in rice sheets, fried shrimp dumplings, steamed rice wrapped in banana leaves, bbq pork wrapped rice sheets, shrimp wrapped rice sheets, bbq pork buns and of course for the finale egg tarts.  The service is slow, you have to nag at the servers to get anything you want and the biggest disadvantage about this restaurant is the fact that you need a Cantonese speaking friend to come with you to increase the service you need. True story.  However much I dislike the service here I always return for the food. When you're hungover there's nothing like dim sum."}
{"text":"Solid Dim Sum and noodle shop/Chinese BBQ without having to go downtown.  For some reason, Pacific Plaza's parking lot always seems to be jammed, but it's still better than paying for your inconvenient parking in Chinatown.  This place can be packed on the weekends, so come early.  Grab an experienced friend if you're not a Dim Sum veteran as it's not always the usual stuff.  Good eats, you can tell by the line of Chinese at the door... you know, the ones that aren't at the Wok Box.  I usually have the noodle shop menu at lunch, hot FAST noodles and Chinese BBQ.  The more formal supper menu is also quite good, but you'll want to order from the Chinese menu, so a Mandarin/Cantonese speaker or Chinese reader will get you a better meal, or ask many questions about what is available."}
{"text":"I've had their DIM SUM.  I'd have to say it is higher quality in seafood but they also price it really \"well\"   Too expensive for me.  Not a regular place I'd visit"}
{"text":"My friends took me here, stating that Forbidden City is one of the best dim sum restaurants in Calgary. One thing I noticed right away - the restaurant is clean and servers are pleasant. I liked the comfortable seats and linen covered tables. Servers were easy to catch.  The items that impressed me the most were the taro with pork dumplings and the BBQ pork crepe. The sui mai and how gow were fine but I found the filling too wet for me. Overall, all the dishes were either fine or above average. As my Yelp stars would indicate, yay! I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Its one of the best dim sum restaurant in NE. Very busy place. Usually with big line up. Dim sum are generally good but prices are on the high side IMO. Service is ok.  Update: good dim sum. Business as usual Foods - 4 Ambient - 4 Service - 3"}
{"text":"Great Dim Sum - plenty of selection, and everything is fresh, and authentic. If you are on a budget this is one of the best places to go. Expect to wait upwards of 20-30 min when it gets busy however there is a mall with lots of neat shops to see while you wait.   Also don't expect a pristine clean dining room; this is authentic Dim Sum, and the best places are going to be a bit sloppy on the presentation, but what is lacking on the presentation is made up for by the taste and the price you paid.  Will defiantly make this a monthly to quarterly treat!"}
{"text":"I come here a lot for dinner and dim sum with my family. It's the only dim sum place not in Chinatown and close to home.   This place has good food for dim sum, lunch or dinner. It's a bit over priced for Chinese food. But overall I'd give 4/5 for food quality.  However, the service here is terrible. I know Asian restaurant aren't known for good service. The hostess at the front for taking seating for dim sum was rude. She doesn't even acknowledge you when your waiting to get a number and there's no such thing as first come first serve. People were budging in line. The servers in the restaurant are too busy playing on there iPhones to take your order or serve you tea.  Overall Get Take Out instead!"}
{"text":"This place offers a legitement dim sum experience in Calgary. Expect lots of selection, complimentary tea, and a majority Asian clientele...always a good sign!"}
{"text":"Found after a bit of a drive-around as I was on my first visit to Calgary.  The lack of external signs did not help.  Located in a wing of a mall, the hostess greeted me as I walked in the door.  There are two sides to this restaurant and I chose the more formal side because of their a la carte food offerings.  The other side was more of a noodle shop, which is great but not what I was after.    A nice pot of chrysanthemum tea was brought, and you can choose any of the teas they have, while I perused the menu.  There was way too many items I wanted to order, but since I was only in town for one more night, I finally, and with difficulty, ordered the Sauteed Shrimp and Scallop with Vegetables.  It was very good, the shrimp were perfectly cooked.  I was charged $2 for rice, which must be the standard practice here.  A complimentary, sweet carrot soup dessert rounded out my meal.  Overall, a very good, reasonably-priced restaurant that was easy to locate once I found it."}
{"text":"Forbidden City is my go-to dim sum spot. Usually my boyfriend and I go on a Saturday or Sunday between 10 a.m. and 11:30 a.m.  Some dishes can be a bit pricey but the food in my experience has always been fresh, hot and flavourful. The food comes out pretty quick and the service for a Chinese restaurant is also pretty decent.  My favourites include:  Pork & Shrimp Siu Mai; Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf; Rice Crepe with Shrimp; Steamed Pork Dumpling; Deep Fried Taro with Shrimp; and  Steamed Chicken Bun.  Their chili oil is amazing as well! If you are looking for a yummy dim sum place in the NE this is your best bet!"}
{"text":"Boyfriend insisted on taking me here during my visit and am so happy he did. The custard buns are my favorite and they were so good here. They came out steaming and so delicious. We ordered typical dim sum fare such as the har gow, rice crepe with the fried dough stick, turnip cake, spare ribs, and the green tea custard bun. All were good so no complaints. Glad I got to try this place out!"}
{"text":"We had big party and waited an hour for a table.  Customer service is terrible, look like they don't have enough server.  We have to look for server many time for things needed.  Dim sum is good but pricey.  I enjoyed their lotus wrap sticky rice most and their Ginger Beef.  Their Peking duck is terrible, dry and not freshly tasted.  With about 12 peoples, our bill comes to $400.  That's hefty price since we don't order any seafood or alcohol."}
{"text":"I went there with my friends a few weeks ago. I think that was my third time there. The food still tastes great. The restaurant was clean, service was good. I don't remember the names of all the dishes I ate. The important part was that it looked good so I ate it, lol."}
{"text":"First Impression:  We stood at the entrance and was waiting to be seated. There was no one at the counter and you could tell this place was incredibly understaffed. Finally a guy came by and took us to our seats. HOWEVER that was went things went downhill. First off he didn't actually ask us how much our party was and just twirled his hand gesturing us to follow him. Not once did he actually speak to us. For those wondering he was perfectly capable of speaking because I saw him talk to other customers.   Secondly they just give you your piece of paper to mark your dim sum and ask what type of tea you like and that's about how much interaction you get. After that, you're on your own. Like literally it's as if you don't exist. If you want something you better holler them over, they won't check on you or refill your tea or water unless you tell them too.  Oh and the bowls and plate they had were dirty. We waited about 20 minutes for them to take our order but no one came to ask us if we needed anything. I had to wait sout another 10 minutes until I actually saw a server remotely near us so I could tell us to take our order.   Food:3/5 It's not superb but there were some dishes that were good and some that were bad. Don't get the steamed pork dumpling ( Xiao long bao) it's skin is thick and there's barely anything actually in it and it's quite dry. The siu Mai and pan dried turnip cake were pretty decent though.   Service: 0/5 Service is non existence. Don't expect anything. You mark the food you want and they take it out for you that's it. Was waiting for my tea to get refilled but never happened. They only came towards our table when they saw us leaving."}
{"text":"What kind I say but this place is hit and miss for authentic Chinese food and their dim sum is on paper order as well so no push carts.   Service is also hit and miss but generally staff are speedy and friendly.   Large restaurant call ahead as they do take reservations but not on holidays.   High chairs available and pricing is above average but you will be getting the real Chinese experience.   3 stars for the inconsistent service and food.   Recommend to try the hot pot as well."}
{"text":"Basing this review off the dim sum only. Dim sum is much better in Canada compared to NY , and when I came here that statement was never truer.  The way they make their cherng fun (rice crepe) is super thin and silky smooth. It's rare for me to find it made just as good as in HK, but it was done right here. I love how they include three sauces with the Chinese donut - similar to how they put peanut sauce, soy and sweet BBQ sauce on the cherng fun with sesame seeds and fish balls. Gah! So good! All their cherng fun is good, including the beef, shrimp and BBQ pork.  Also recommend anything with shrimp. Get the siu mai and ha gao! The chicken rice wrapped in banana leaf is also great. Everything was good though! Wish we had this level of quality for NYC dim sum.  Tip: ask for the house made hot sauce! Super good!"}
{"text":"I went with a small group for Chinese food at this two location restaurant at the Pacific Mall.  Parking was a breeze which is the reason we came to the NE there weren't any locations downtown on the street to park. The restaurant is really elegantly decked out and I almost felt I was at a Chinese wedding.  There were tons of people there on Monday night mostly Chinese which is a great sign.  We ordered the Peking Duck with wraps and Ginger Chicken and the Sweet and Sour Pork with mixed vegetables.  The Duck at $36 was supposed to feed 10 people but it wasn't a very large portion, it didn't event compare to the portion of the Peking Duck served at the Shanghai.  I was really hungry so any food at this point was exciting.  The chicken was nice and crispy and the pork was good too. These three plates and a huge bucket of rice came at around $75.  The man at this restaurant put a place of food on our table claiming I had order it which I didn't.  He said it was only $5 if I ordered the Peking Duck but it alone was $15.  I said I didn't really care how much it was I hadn't ordered it, he insisted I try it again and again I felt badgered into eating something that I didn't order.  He finally took it back and I graciously got the bill.  Aside from the forcing of food and small portions, it was a good meal and the waitresses there are very pleasant.  The interior is quite gorgeous so it really enhances the meal.  For Chinese food however there are just as delicious restaurants at more affordable prices"}
{"text":"Legit, high quality dim sum in the northeast.  Ordering is a la carte (in other words, no carts)...  My favourites are the pork and chive dumplings, BBQ pork buns, and the sticky rice.  I think there is a lack of good veg dishes and the variety on the menu is just so-so (by Chinese dim sum resto standards), but these are only complaints I started to notice after several visits.  The price is mid range for dim sum in yyc- budget 10-15 dollars per person for lots of food. Parking is plentiful but walking around that lot is dangerous- don't dim sum and drive, people!"}
{"text":"I 've been here several times for both dim sum and dinner. I find the food pretty decent, but the service with the waitress there is not so great. I mean I have to say some people that works there doesn't seem too willing to get me my pair of chopsticks and glass of water.  I have an incident with a girl there that would not like tp change my order that she made a mistake on and of course we got to the manager and everything is fixed, but still that just proof my point their service is not great. So far that was the only bad incident I had with them. Hopefully other yelpers that would like to tried this place, would not have a bad experience like I did."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. Dim sum was really good and there were no carts to be seen, but you order right before you are seated. The order form is quite long and allows you to mark a 1 or a 2 order option. Careful as some things are combos and if you order between two families like us, we ended up with 6 orders of chicken feet! Duck tongue was a first for me and I enjoyed it. I ordered off a special menu and got the dumplings with wasabi mayo sauce - not overwhelming and made this place stand out. The other visit was non dim sum. Peking duck in rice crepes vs typical steam buns was an interesting twist. Overall, every dish ordered was tasty and equal or better than any Chinese restaurant I've been to. I can see why my relatives say this place is #1."}
{"text":"Best dim sum in town!   Food is fresh, not too salty.  Service is okay.   Big place but still need to line up on weekends, so try to go before 11am"}
{"text":"Food is OK.  Service is sub-par at best.  I made reservations and they still made us wait for 10 minutes.  After 10 minutes we found out some of our party was already seated.  Poor handling of the reservations.  Their servers placed a dish on our lazy susan incorrectly and it spilled some tea in the process.  The manager scolded us and told us we should be more careful.  He didn't even get anyone to come by and clean up the spill, we had to clean it up ourselves.  Would've given it a 1-star rating if it wasn't for the food quality and cheap price."}
{"text":"Where to began? Hm ... Well I love dim sum, that's number one. And the dim sum here is fricken delicious! They have a great selection and variety on their menu and their dishes taste truly Chinese. This restaurant would get 4 stars from me solely from their food. It would get 5 stars if the dishes were cheaper, like what happened to $3 dim sum dishes? And wow their service .... If I had to rate their service it would be like -2 stars. Every time I come here I feel like I have to chase down my waiters, literally. I asked one of the guys for a spoon and he gave me a dirty look. Talk about quality service. Don't expect to be treated like Queen Elizabeth here guys.   All and all, 3 stars. I would come back and eat here because its close to home and I'm use to the crappy Asian services."}
{"text":"I would probably have to say in terms of flavour, they probably have the best dim-sum in Calgary. The food is freshly cooked and packed with flavour.   One of the things you can definitely notice with fresh vs old is the har gow (steamed shrimp dumplings). When they are fresh, the dumpling wrapper hold up to chopsticks, where as something steaming too long breaks apart before you bring it to your mouth. There are too many great dishes to talk about here as they use an order sheet rather than the cart at non-peak times to keep things fresh.   Hardest part about eating here is not knowing what anything is or looks like.  That makes it hard to order off the menu. Also when trying something new, it's a risk as the descriptions on the paper may not be what you picture.   Definitely worth a stop for dim-sum but be willing to work with service that sometimes seems rude and many if the older staff have limited English language skills."}
{"text":"My friend and I were in Calgary today, hailing from Edmonton and we were yearning for some dim sum! I searched on Yelp and found this location & we thought we'd give it a go!  We arrived a bit after noonish and waited around 10 minutes or so to be seated; which is understandable as it's a Saturday afternoon.  Once seated although, we had no idea what the process was to get food as we hadn't been here before & nothing was explained by the \"hostess\". (Thankfully these Yelp reviews shined some light on what to do!)  After filling out the little sheet; we waited & waited.... & waited.... Over 15 minutes passed before someone acknowledged us to take our order. In that time of our waiting, many waitresses passed & even after speaking up, ignored us.... :(  The food although didn't take long to arrive to our table which is a good  thing because we were both pretty ravenous & it was pretty good!  Overall, I wouldn't return to this place no matter how much I love dim sum.   I found the atmosphere to be too loud; I could barely hold a conversation with all the other conversations & constant clinking of dishes being placed or removed. There is no customer service with the waitresses; not one of them engaged in polite conversation or even cracked a smile which kind of made me feel unwelcome to be honest. The chopsticks had food encrusted on them; I found this pretty unnerving & didn't appreciate the eye roll from the waitress when I asked to have them replaced. There's no explanation of the process for newbies trying out their location. The wait time to actually order anything is ridiculous; we waited 15+ minutes after completing the little sheet before we finally got someone to pay attention to us.  The only thing I found good about this place was the food."}
{"text":"I've had dim sum here twice and both times I noticed that it's packed, which is a good sign.  Food is your typical dim sum items you'll find at many similar restaurants.  Service is fast.  Our first dishes started coming out under 10 minutes of us submitting our order. The second our tea pot was empty and we flipped the lid (universal sign that you want it refilled) the pot was taken and replaced with fresh hot tea right away.  Food was tasty.  My favorite was the thousand year egg congee, steamed pork rice wrapped in banana leaf and shrimp in rice crepe. We also ordered all the typical dim sum items like chicken feet, dumplings ect ect ect, all good.  We didn't order the Chinese donut wrapped in a rice crepe, but we saw another table order it and it looked delicious.   Also, if you're new to dim sum dining, don't be put off by the \"service\", you won't get smiles or any warm and fuzzy sentiments from the staff, culturally, the goal is to be efficient and fast. So don't take it personal if you don't get any \"friendliness.\" The Staff work hard to make sure you get your food fast and hot!"}
{"text":"NEVER will i go back. why? because they refuse to change their big chipped tea pot. food is good though..little bit pricy...if you are caucasian, you will be served properly vs. chinese like me.  i used to go there every sunday...until they sacrificed safety...the waitress said \"sorry we dont have any other pot\"...i was one of like 5 customers in the restaurant. with that big of a restaurant they got more than 6 teapots."}
