{"text":"Their food is delicious and very very reasonably priced. They'd get 5 stars if their service wasn't incredibly slow. Expect to wait 30-40 mins for a sandwich while the staff hits on all the girls. Can't say they aren't friendly though!"}
{"text":"Sandwich poulet bon, burger ok mais steak un peu sec, frites tres grasses, hotdog ok. Le plat typique Pablon je ne peux pas vous dire, il n est jamais arrivé et une fois que tout le monde avait quasi fini, pas envie d attendre encore pour l obtenir (le service a ete tres long). Donc peut etre faut il plutot s orienter sur les plats typiques et avoir du temps !! Gentils et de bonne volonte mais ils n etaient que 2 donc les commandes les unes apres les autres ca prend bcp de temps !"}
{"text":"I've had better arepas.  The cornbread was nice, but steak tasted old and found the sandwich to be overly salty.  I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Ok. So maybe I had the highest hopes since this was rated as a perfect 5 stars. Maybe my expectations were too high but I really wish I could say I enjoyed it. Truth is I did not. My family ordered the same thing: rice, beans and grilled chicken. The rice was cold. The bean portion was tiny and the boneless thighs were bland. I had a version of a pulled bbq sandwich which was meh at best. The 2 stars are for the yuca fries which actually were ok. Overall disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Was ok notting special I had arepa long time ago I can say the arepa was toasted good I find is overpriced for what u get"}
{"text":"Yummmyyyyy!!! I'm on an arepas kick! The grilled arepas here are deelish, good habanero hotsauce and amazing staff! Had a beef one and the shredded beef was marinated in some sort of delicous magic sauce. Only thing, they loved blasting cheesy pop music the whole time. But it's worth enduring for the deliciousness."}
{"text":"Arepa c'est un pain traditionel de Colombie et de Venezuela fait avec farine de mais.  Arepas venezolanas recomendadas. Mi preferida: la pabellon!! Y el jugo de maracuya. Tienen opcion vegetariana. Aunque es un restaurante venezolano,  estas arepas me recuerdan  mucho a mi Colombia."}
{"text":"Great after-drinking spot. They open until 4am on weekends so there is no excuse for losing your dignity and going to McDonalds anymore. I love the tequeños!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing. I had a pulled pork arepa. It was huge and delicious and the price was reasonable. Topped it off with a Venezuelan Colita. Will definitely be going back here."}
{"text":"This is my second visit to Cacique and the food is really good. We had different kinds of Arepas and they were all delicious.  Cons: service is really slow and the music is very loud."}
{"text":"1. Wait until you are very hungry. 2. Go to Cacique Grill and order their Passion Fruit Pulled Pork Sandwich for under $10. 3. Enjoy the wonderfully messy, incredibly satisfying, juicy pulled pork, infused with a slightly tangy (not spicy) marinade, garlic mayo, and tomatoes on a kaiser-roll style bun (without poppy seeds). Also their aioli for dipping the fries into was stupendous! 4. If satisfied with these instructions, pass them on to a friend."}
{"text":"Awful service, cold food, ordinary taste, and disregard for hygiene. The cook handles money in the cash goes back to kitchen and handles food, without changing gloves or washing hands. Bathrooms are one of the dirtiest I have seen in my life!  I don't recommend this place to anyone.   Sad how entrepreneurs don't take their business seriously."}
{"text":"It was 10pm on a Monday night, and I had these urges to eat a Venezuelan arepa. To my surprise, there was this place open till 11 pm, just like the Areperas in Venezuela, open until late.   I had una pelua (carne mechada y queso amarillo / shredded beef and yellow cheese), it was very good. I also had tequeños (it's like a little bread filled with cheese), very good as well."}
{"text":"You have to try these stuffed arepas! Great flavor, fresh ingredients and generous portions.  I had the \"pelua\", a shredded beef with tomatoes and onions, served with white cheese."}
{"text":"Stumbled on this place on our family trip to Montreal. The food here is quite good. The only reason why I'm giving 3 stars is that there were 3 things on the menus that they said they didn't have. There was a mixed appetizer plate that they said they no longer offered. Then there was the steak that we ordered and subsequently found out that they ran out of. Lastly it was the cheese they typically use for their corn pancake, which they ran out of.   The food we did get was great however. We may have caught them on a bad day, so you might want to give them a try."}
{"text":"I went there with my girlfriend, not knowing what to expect, and ordered the passion fruit pulled pork sandwich. Now I know pork and sweet flavors mix well but I though that pork and passion fruit was a bit weird. I even joked with my girlfriend that I was so hungry that even if it was bad I would finish the whole thing. Boy do I want to be wrong like that all the time. The flavors were perfect. And let's not forget the textures. The fried plantain and avocado did a wonder to add that extra bit of creaminess and it contrasted perfectly with the crunchy arepa bun. It was just wonderful. Also, we didn't realize it but you can order your arepa as a combo with fries and a drink. Next time I'm on the plateau, I will be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"The pulled pork sandwich was HUGE and tasty. My boyfriend got the combo and they loaded his basket with fries. Only complaint was that it was a little slow to get our food (20-25 mins) but it was very good and affordable!"}
{"text":"I can now add Venezuelan food to my ever growing list of positive culinary experiences! I had never tried Venezuelan cuisine before, so I had no idea what to expect. The staff was very helpful and informative about the menu offerings which definitely made the ordering process easier.  Upon their recommendation, I tried one of their arepas, which are basically grilled pouches made with corn meal and filled with sausage, cheese, ham and vegetables. On a cold and rainy day in Montreal, this hot meal definitely hit the spot! As a lot of other reviews have suggested, the service is a bit slow, but as long as you are not in a hurry to be anywhere, this is a great spot that I will absolutely try again."}
{"text":"L'endroit et le service est plutôt sympa. C'est la première fois et c'était correcte, sans plus. J'ai testé la cachapa avec fromage. Je n'ai pas trouvé cela exceptionnel mais j'y retournerais peut être pour tester autre chose et ne pas rester sur ma fin."}
{"text":"J'ai bien aimé les arepas qui vendent ce n'ai pas une place facile a trouver mais l'ambiance et tres bonne pour le service c'est assez long pour le peu de personne qui vont la je parle pour le jour que j'y suis allé c'était vide et ils ont pris assez de temps a ns servire les prix sont assez élevé pour la qualité des produit mais ce n'ai pas un resto fast food donc j'imagine que on peu comprendre pour le reste tout est parfait"}
{"text":"Very personal and friendly. He accommodated our diet restrictions and taste buds. All at once pleasantly."}
{"text":"I found a delicious mess in a basket at Cacique Grill, housed in the former Bocadillo location (not sure what the story behind this is, but right now it's just about the food).  Long story short the pulled pork burger could be considered heaven sent. Marinated in passion fruit juice, inter-dispersed with garlic mayo and sliced tomato, the lusciousness burst forth from the pillow soft bun.   I needed a fork to gather the droppings, and I just about ate the sauced wax paper for dessert, it was that good. All that was left was a crumpled bunch of napkins and fork.  I declare it the best tasting and messiest $10 pulled pork sandwich this side of St. Laurent (since their address is 1 Mont Royal West).  Tip: Get the key and visit the modern executive styled bathroom, down a corridor tucked behind the kitchen. Probably the best bathroom this side of...you get the picture.  Lot's of other items to try, so need more visits. Nuf' said."}
{"text":"The food here is decent but man are they ever slow. I've been waiting 30 minutes now for a burger, despite them already serving the people who came 5 minutes after me - they're almost done eating btw. This isn't a one time thing either - seems to happen every time. I should have gone to Pitarifique.    And I just noticed that they charged me for a trio when I didn't ask for one. Ffs."}
{"text":"Has almost the same menu as Bocadillo, I recommend the passion fruit pulled pork for sure! Also they have really good hot dogs."}
{"text":"absolutely delicious i tried the pulled pork sandwich once so far the best i ever had better than the greasy southern us ones by far they have this hint of passion fruit in the sauce. yesterday i went back and had a steak it was juicy, the grill gives it extra flavour, their chimichurri is to die for and they give me an extra hot sauce which was absolutely great it had an orange color and fruity taste but it was spicy. the yucca fries were just AMAZING so crunchy and thick yet moist inside."}
{"text":"Guava and cheese sticks \"Tequeños\" are delicious! Any arepa you'll try will make you ask for more! Try \"La Catira\" for chicken lovers or \"La Pelúa\" or \"Llanera\" for beef lovers!! You won't be deceived!!"}
{"text":"Tried an arepas lamalandra with chorizo ham cheese garlic sauce and tomatoes looks great but I wonder what cacique stands for must look it up on google"}
{"text":"Mmmmmmm très bon, tasty arepas et ambiance décontracté, musique typique et service gentil. Je reviendrai n'importe quand pour le lunch !!!  Par contre le couloir vers les toillettes est vraiment scary ... aussi j'ai été surprise du menu à la table sans prix... pour savoir les prix vous devez les voir sur un tableau derriere la caisse... Maybe because the law... C'est une cafetéria et ne pas un resto.  Prenez note que la deuxieme entrée sur le coté ( rue st laurent ) est plus pratique ..."}
{"text":"The food is great. It may be a little slow sometimes, but it's worth the wait - plus you can always take yours out and head to nearby Jeanne Mance park (I find it's quicker when you make an order to go). Their La Catira (pulled chicken and cheese arepa) is delicious."}
