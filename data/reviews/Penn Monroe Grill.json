{"text":"Old style Pittsburgh bar and tavern. Been around for years. Great Wings, big done anyway you could want?"}
{"text":"After leaving a grubby place across the street from the Penn Monroe, we had a delightful meal of baked cavitini and meatball! This is a great locally run place with daily specials!  Sitting near a window, looking across the street at the place we left because of the HORRIABLE smell...I was so relieved we found this wonderful place!"}
{"text":"I have visited the Penn Monroe on multiple occasions for lunch.  They have lunch specials everyday of the week.  The meatballs (whether on the sandwich or pasta) are the best!  They have a nice Italian mix and are amazing!  The sauce is excellent as well.  Nice environment, friendly owner, some bartenders are better than others.  Drink prices are slightly higher than what they should be for the environment/location.  Food is outstanding though!  I do recommend though."}
{"text":"This is a great place...food is excellent and the atmosphere is classic bar scene. Diverse crowd and very friendly. Came into town with 2 others for a military show and ate here 4 nights in a row and enjoyed every meal."}
{"text":"Let me preface this with an \"overheard on the street\" comment - place is supposedly closing soon to make way for brandy spankin new hotel or something so if what I describe to you sounds right up your alley, you better head on over pronto before the joint is demolished.    It is a very typical Pittsburgh bar/lounge in that you may encounter sonic music blasting from ancient speakers hooked up to a juke box filled with a dizzying assortment of country and metal.  The air will be thick with smoke and the fried tasty wings and other creations will be sliding out of the kitchen to arrive hot and delicious at your spot at the bar.  We ended up next to some of the regulars - sales dudes from the local Kia dealership and they were super fun and likeable.    It's sort of a honky tonk, stick with the regular bar food, kinda joint.  Nice barmaids and similarly nice clientele that like their music LOUD.  I have read some of the other reviews that mention the pasta and meatballs as being good but, honestly, on my first visit I opted for the bar food.  Who knows?  Maybe I'll make it back before the wrecking ball swings."}
{"text":"Barmaids provide bad service and are generally mean and cliquish."}
{"text":"Sit at bar. Good tvs quick service and good local bat"}
{"text":"This is the bar that time forgot. Walk through the door and into the bar and you wouldn't guess a roaring highway lay just feet away from you. The Penn Monroe has a  surprisingly large selection of beer on draft for what it is. I believe it was 10 taps total which is really the perfect size for this kind of bar. The wings are fantastic and part of the reason is they are made fresh right when you order them so expect a 15-20min wait time on the wings.   The cheesesteak was just okay. I bit into a small bone or ligament or something it and it kind of turned me off luckily that was towards the end. Probably won't get it again but my Dad got the Reuben and said it was a very good Reuben and to \"tell that yelp thing good bars have good reubens.\" Anyway I'll be back especially on Tuesday 7-12 $3 all craft beer 16oz drafts."}
{"text":"I love places like this and like to think this type of bar/restaurant only exists in western, pa although I'm sure everytown america has these places all over.  I went here on Friday with Ray for a very unhealthy lunch.  This is a monroeville institution and has been here for over 50 years.  In fact, I think I can remember coming here 20 + years ago when it was a local watering hole for my uncles.  Now, many people believe happiness has a lot to do with expectations so don't expect fine dining, kid friendly or even smoke free dining because somehow these folks are able to have this a full smoking establishment although I'm not really sure how because I'm sure more than 20% of the revenue does come from food which is the current smoking ban law (I think?).  Here's what you can expect... exceptional bar food and cheap beer specials.  There are two main doors to the joint that both enter into the bar/lounge area.  Its got a square bar with plenty of stools and seat yourself four tops scattered around the perimeter.  There are a few plasmas and plenty of bar machinges.  Of course you'll find the obligatory \"entertainment only\" poker machines, jukebox and a few video games including my favorite golden tee...  Ray and I found a comfy enough table in the corner.  The diners are all types, ages, races and everything from grinders to suits.  We were greeted quickly enough by a friendly waitress.  I ordered a cup of chile with a mound of onions and cheese.  It was served piping hot and had a great rich spicy flavor.  As a chili connoisseur (sp?) this was top notch bar chili.  I ordered the philly steak and cheese wrap as well.  The wrap must have had a lb. of meat and was overflowing with cheese, onions and peppers. The serving size was definitely enough for two meals.  The quality of the steak itself was kind of meh', but again it was only about $7 and certainly was adequate especially when doused with plenty of condiments.  Ray ordered the chili and also the wings.  I had one of the wings and it was really good.  Big plump whole wings at an inexpensive price.  However they did charge an extra buck for the ranch which I think should be included.  My only complaint really would be the service was good but pretty slow.  However, the gal was the only server for the whole restaurant and there was another guy (either the owner or a really friendly employee) who kept us relatively entertained with chatter while we were waiting.  There is a reason why the Penn Monroe has been around for over 50 years and if you're considering tg mcfunsters or the like that litter the concrete jungle that is Monroeville  I suggest you give this local instititution a try instead."}
