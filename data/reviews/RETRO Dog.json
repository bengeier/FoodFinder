{"text":"Loved all the veggie options. I got the veggie dog and was very impressed. Fries were very good, but onion rings were too greasy. I'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Fun place and something a little different.  Hot dog and burger options abound.  The onion rings and fries are greasy and delicious - dip them both in whatever magical sauce comes with the onion rings.  Chili and root beer are also good   This is not a place for people who are afraid of calories - they have a token side salad and a black bean burger if you want to feign healthy eating while scarfing fries. Ordering is kind of a pain especially if there's a line since there's not a lot of room to stand in line - you order at the counter; then the order taker takes your money and gets your drinks; you sit down; and they bring the food out to you sometimes having to call out by name.  They have car service outside, why not have wait service inside?"}
{"text":"Went there on a Monday. Placed looked like a slow night.  The selections were interesting and the fries Tasty.  Got two of there special dogs(Chicago and Bonzai). Buns were very stale and i think the dog was on the griddle a little too long. If I'm in the neighborhood I might give them a try gain but nothing I would go out of my way for. On a positive note the Employees working were very attentive and nice."}
{"text":"Talk about living the old car hop idea.  Retro Dog has amazing food and awesome service.  Their milk shakes are amazing.  The flavor combinations are always spot on.  You can go in or have the car hop come out and bring you your food.  Love it."}
{"text":"My significant other and I have been frequenting this establishment since it opened. We could probably walk there in less than ten minutes. He loves the natural casing hot dogs and I love the Retro burger. Both are an incredible quality at a great price. They also have some of the best seasoned fries around. I throughly enjoy all of their frozen treats as well. They make a frozen custard marble that is amazing, with any topic you can think of, plus their milkshake selection is seriously impressive. I dig the curb side dining experience, and Retrodog is doing it much better than any of the other competitors around. The staff is always sweet, quick and you can tell that they enjoy working there. Great customer service. Oh yeah, and they make homemade root beer that is very good and unique. It's a must try. I'll never go back to a Swensons/Skyway/A&W ever again. The quality of food alone makes them stand out above the competition. IMO they are the number one burger/hotdog/fries experience in the Akron area."}
{"text":"Man do I love Retro Dog!! This awesome mom and pop business does not disappoint.    

It's a hot dog place, so of course the dogs are wonderful (my favorite is the Carolina) but that doesn't mean you should shy away from the burgers! Whenever I'm really hungry I get a Hula burger. Provolone cheese, lettuce, grilled onions, bacon, and a pineapple slice all doused in this incredible spicy hula sauce. Yum!

Don't forget to save room for custard! Not ice cream, but delicious, creamy custard. There is not a single thing on the desert menu that I wouldn't get. 

The service is very friendly and helpful! They genuinely seem to be very happy at this establishment. Not the usual disgruntled employees. The managers are just as wonderful! Always making sure you're happy, and that your visit is a good one.

This place is unlike any other restaurant I've been to, and I always recommend it to anyone who is ever going through that area. I love retro dog!"}
{"text":"Great dogs and burgers. Friendly and quick service and it's very clean too. The milkshakes are some of the best around. We love the chocolate peanut butter shake."}
{"text":"Loved it since it opened. Everything's great but be sure to ask for your dog ungrilled if you don't like the charring. I like it like that but my kids don't."}
{"text":"I don't know how they stay in business.  There's never anyone there.  
The dogs and milkshakes are good.  It can't hold a candle to Swenson's, but it's closer to where I love, so it's still a contender for me."}
{"text":"I really was looking forward to a great hot dog and was suprised the retro dog was so tasteless and boring.  I was surprised when I saw the lady sweeping the floor put  the broom down and take the French frie with her bare hands and put my order of fries in the fryer."}
{"text":"This is my regular lunch stop when I am in Stow. The food is fantastic. There isn't an item on the menu I haven't had and haven't enjoyed. 

Come for the food, but stay for the shakes.  If that isn't your thing go for the root beer on tap. It's the best in town. 

The monthly food specials keep the menu interesting. 

The absolute best aspect of Retro Dog is the staff. I haven't met a better crew anywhere else. 

In short, this place receives two lion fists up from Voltron."}
{"text":"This review is written by my 6 year old son. \"The ice cream is really good and icy here. The twist is my favorite. Also, the grilled cheese is pretty cheesy!\""}
{"text":"Nice surprise! We normally stay in the car and enjoy the carhop service. But it's Ohio and it's winter so we decided to venture inside on our last couple visits. I'm glad we did. The inside decor is worth the trip but the service is just as good. Its warm (always a plus for around here), the service is very good, and there's music as well. Everything I've ordered has been good to very good and the prices are great. I always want to support a local business when I can -- just hope this one sticks around long enough to gain a following."}
{"text":"This place is great! The white hot (veal/pork) dog is amazing! The shakes are amazing and their hula ghost burger BLEW MY MIND! made with a ghost chili sauce with bacon, grilled onion and pineapple makes for a burger that's out of this world!"}
{"text":"Run, don't walk, to Retro Dog. Had lunch there yesterday. Great food and very nice and attentive people. Had dogs and delicious fries, very crispy and hot! Dogs had a nice snap and the buns were perfect. They have so much more than the dogs, too. Lots of choices. Don't let the exterior fool you, it's not just drive up. There is nice seating inside for at least 40. Get out to Retro Dog and support a local business with very good food and wonderful people!"}
{"text":"I was the only car at curbside, yet it took 5 minutes for someone to bring me a menu.  I paid $22 plus for a cheeseburger, veggie dog, two orders of fries (which were very small) and 2 shakes.  The cheeseburger was not edible.  It was fatty and there was so much salt on it that I had to throw it out.  While good, the fries were in a really small cup.  I could pay the same price and get a large overflowing cup at Five Guys.  The only good thing from the whole experience was the free trade coffee shake.  Won't be back for the food."}
{"text":"I normally like retro spots like these. This one didn't really wow me. The food is extremely greasy, kind of flavorless and they cover all the ice cream in chocolate syrup. The service was pretty speedy and I've never seen it jam packed so you can get in and out quickly. Decent place for a quick bite or if you live in the neighborhood and want to walk up it would be a nice little walk."}
{"text":"Love this place! My kids ask to go every week! I don't eat red meat, so of course when my husband suggested a hot dog place I reluctantly went! I was pleasantly surprised by the menu! A veggie dog, chicken sandwich and veggie burger! I've had the veggie dog and chicken sandwich, both were great! I'm trying the veggie burger next! Oooh, and the milkshakes, so yummy. Oh and the veggie cheese fries, so good! Even if you like meat the veggie options will satisfy...just has my husband the meat eater! 
Not only is the food great, the service is absolutely amazing too! So friendly!"}
{"text":"Others seem to enjoy the restaurant, so maybe you will enjoy it, but...

My wife's hotdog was warm rather than hot. It was also very small compared to the bun. My cheeseburger was the same way.

The root beer was close, but too sweet for both out tastes.

I think that they spent too much effort on the decor and TVs and not enough on the food."}
{"text":"I have never had a negative experience here! Quick service, food is ready quickly, servers are sweet. Cream soda is addicting! The hot dogs and burgers are delish! We have been coming here since they opened. Only thing we have never done is go inside to eat. It's always so fun eating in the car with the kids!! You should eat here!!"}
{"text":"Good selection of burgers n dogs. The hotdogs n fries are outstanding, as well as the shakes n rootbeer floats!  Our servers have always been topnotch, and keep the area clean n tidy.  Great place to eat any time of year-inside or in your car!"}
{"text":"Good food, fast service. It makes me a little sad that '80's music is considered retro but that's life. 
Clean, great decor & branding. Fun place to eat."}
{"text":"If you want to relive your misspent youth, or get a flavor of where to go after the sock hop ends, this is the place. Tasty, tasty hot dogs, hamburgers, and the usual sides, plus milkshakes and other desserts. Pull up and order from your car, or sit outside or inside. I often get a hankerin' for a coney dog in the summer, and I really enjoyed the Retro Dog. Hot dog was perfect and a nice soft bun to keep the coney sauce to hot dog ratio just right. The Carolina dog had a flavorful complement of coleslaw for a mellow blend of dog and vegs. Got cheesy bacon fries, which have some heat due to the spicy fries coating. Onion rings were also good. They are also open late when there are events going on at Blossom."}
{"text":"This place was gross! The best thing on the hot dog was the mustard I had Conney sauce and Cole slaw and they were no good. And on top of it the Server that came to the car was rude. They didn't say hello...how are you...nothing! They just handed a menu thru the window and said turn on your lights when you're ready to order. Then when we were done they never said how was everything...nothing! Even tho they seen my brothers hot dog only had one bite missing from it because it was so nasty! For a $4 dog and service like that this place doesn't even deserve a 1/4 of a star!!"}
{"text":"very good tasting hot dogs, a lot of options for toppings. a little bit more expensive than you'd want just for hot dogs, but the atmosphere is awesome and there's a lot of menu choices. I would recommend."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with co-workers. I had the Chicago dog and onion rings with a drink. Dog was excellent, rings not so much. Incredibly greasy - even too much for rings. Unfortunately my co-worker had a disasterous Retro Burger. There was a 9\" or so brown, curly hair found in the MIDDLE of her burger. 

We observed a female employee with shoulder-length, brown, curly hair; not tied back or in a hair net, cooking the food. This is gross, unsanitary, and bad restaurant management.

According to www.fda.gov - retail food protection - Chapter 2-402.11: \" (A) Food employees shall wear hair restraints such as hats, hair coverings or nets, beard restraints, and clothing that covers body hair, that are designed and worn to effectively keep their hair from contacting exposed FOOD; clean equipment, utensils, and linens; and unwrapped single-service and single-use articles. 

It was asked that the burger be re-made, and yet again, the same female employee was cooking as before. The practice of employee hygiene is a basic essential of running a restaurant. Shame on the owner for not being aware of day-to-day operations with his/her employee(s). 

I will not be going back, nor recommending this establishment."}
{"text":"My friends and I walked to Retro dog after school. We assumed it would be cheaper than wing warehouse. The staff was helpful and friendly. My friends and I got milkshakes and burgers.
I got a milkshake and cheese fry and my friend, who I payed for, got a burger and milkshake. I didn't expect the total to come as $20 but we enjoyed our time there and the food was good."}
{"text":"Great variety and the best dog in town. Try the rice crispy marshmallow shake/flurry thing. Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"We LOVE this place! Locally owned, great quality, and amazing customer service from the staff and owner (who we've seen every time we've been there)!  If you haven't been yet, get there!"}
{"text":"Soooooo disappointed.  As others had mentioned the onion rings are horrible...just rings of grease. The actual hot dog and burger were tasty...but bread and stuff not so much. I've had better root beer...odd after taste. We gave you a try...there is potential."}
{"text":"Seriously. Banzai burger. Best I have ever ever had.  Everything at this old school/new school place...reasonable prices and tasty service..."}
{"text":"Well, just another fast food joint.  Great pictures on the walls.  But that is not what you are going to get."}
{"text":"I'm surprised to see so many negative reviews! I went for the grand opening and while we waited for our food it was so worth the wait. I'm a hot dog snob, expect to pay more for it and was not disappointed. The natural casing dog was perfectly crisped in the outside, flavorful on the inside. I ordered the Kraut Dog, kraut, pickles, mustard, delicious! We shared the chili fries that really hit the spot and finished it off with their house root beer. I'll definitely be going back to try the rest if the menu soon... Especially the chili dog."}
{"text":"This place is good.  The hot dogs are excellent and the burgers are good.  They seem like decent people and are friendly.

My biggest complaint  is that it is a bit on the expensive side.  We go here fairly regularly."}
{"text":"Drove by yesterday before leaving stow and after the big storm turned out no one was around the place was not open. So instead of waiting drove up to Panda Express In Parma which was horrible mistake."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with RETRO Dog. As an ovo-lacto vegetarian (I eat eggs and dairy products), I am never sure if somewhere that specializes in hot dogs will have any options for me, but RETRO Dog has not one but three vegetarian entrees--a veggie dog, a veggie Italian sausage, and a black bean burger. They also offer veggie chili, veggie coney sauce, and veggie cheese fries.

I had a veggie dog with veggie coney sauce and cole slaw and a side of onion rings. The dog had a pleasant texture and flavor and the toppings were scrumptious. I have tried quite a few veggie dogs in my day and this was definitely one of the best. The onion rings were unlike any other rings I have tried. The batter had an interesting flavor and was not crumbly like many other rings, but it was crisp and delicious. I also enjoyed the zesty sauce that accompanied the rings.

I chose the locally-brewed root beer for my beverage and I was not disappointed. The flavor was mellow and not overly sweet and it was served in a fancy chilled mug. 

My dining companions ordered a veggie Italian sausage, a RETRO Dog, a Red Hot, and a couple other meat dogs and everyone was satisfied. We also happened to go on a buy one, get one free hot dog day, which was a pleasant surprise for the pocket book. 

We chose to eat inside, rather than utilizing the Swenson's-style carports. They looked fine, if that's your thing. The atmosphere inside is a fun mix of retro kitsch and contemporary. The chairs are surprisingly comfortable and the service was efficient and friendly. 

I highly recommend RETRO Dog. I will definitely be returning to sample the rest of the vegetarian delights and specialty sodas."}
{"text":"Expensive and lacked flavor. This was very disappointing. We love a good hot dog with various toppings. We asked for natural casing hot dog and didn't get it also requested all beef dogs and didn't get them.   We won't give it a second try."}
{"text":"i'm generously giving RETRO Dog 3 stars because it's a cool concept and a cool looking place. there was really nothing wrong with our food, it just wasn't awesome and there was a HUGE issue with the place we didn't notice until we sat down (we ate inside).

it was Danielle's idea for lunch (because she thinks i have the palette of a 4 year old, i guess) and we drove out after making our final payment for our September vacation (which was on the way). 

Danielle ordered a Memphis Belle Chicken sandwich and i ordered a Carolina dog and a White Hot dog. we got these as combos so that we could share an order of fries and an order of onion rings and each came with a soda. 

Danielle said her sandwich was good but was served very hot (which i'd like to think is the idea, right?). the White Hot that i ordered (a hot dog made of veal and pork - which looks \"white\" when cooked) was good enough, but not terribly flavorful. it could have used a spicier mustard or maybe just more than what was on it (which honestly looked like enough). i didn't care for the Carolina dog (a Coney w/ coleslaw and yellow mustard). i didn't like the coney sauce or the coleslaw. in fact, i removed the wiener and ate it separately - making it considerably more tolerable. the fries and the onion rings were good, though maybe the rings were a little overcooked. i thought they tested good anyway. the sodas were really small and the entire cup was filled with ice so that you took about 3 pulls off the straw and the Coke or Diet Coke within was gone. they were kind enough to refill, though. 

our biggest complaint was that the place was overrun by flies. they were everywhere. i'm not some dandy that can't handle a fly here and there, but there were like 8 per table just hanging out flying around and on the food and just buzzing our faces while we tried to eat. 

assuming we go back (and i would like to try the Kraut Dog as well as the Big Sal sandwich and maybe others) we'll probably order from our car or we'll get it to go and dine without the flies."}
{"text":"Eaten here a handful of times. The hot dogs are good. They have nice snap when you bite into them. Burger decent. Nice to go to when your going to or coming back from Blossom. Root beer is good too. Worth a try. Use the coupons you get. I think the prices could be a bit better. But I'm cheap so I don't like to pay a lot for a hot dog. It's just a hot dog... But worth the try to see if you like it. Eat inside. Too messy to eat in your car. But it's cool to eat in your car so if you don't care then go for it."}
{"text":"(6-18-12) My daughter had a Noon appointment not far away - pulled in at 11:05am figuring a hot dog joint should be able to get us in and out within 30 minutes. Boy was i wrong I had to FLAG DOWN a server @ 11:40 just to take back the menu since i knew we wouldn't have time to order and eat. I sat there with my lights on from 11:20 until 11:40 waiting for someone to take my order. Several servers looked like they were afraid to talk to people as they run back and forth looking at the ground. At one point i counted 6 cars under the canopy with lights on and no one around. One employee stood in the front of the building (apparently on break) just looking at all the cars with lights on. MANAGER NOWHERE TO BE FOUND. I will try again as they are new and hopefully everyone will be better trained."}
{"text":"We were here on a weekday afternoon.  I had a white hot dog and my companions had Chicago dogs.  Mine was acceptable.  Their hot dogs were not great.  If you strip away the bun and the toppings, the hot dogs should be amazing.  They were very flat.  There is a huge difference between cheap hot dogs and flavorful hot dogs and these were generic at best.  The hand cut fries were decent but not amazing.  The onion rings were awful, full of grease, and well done.  The dip for the onion rings would be better if it was a full flavor mustard.  The service was quick.  The prices and portions were acceptable until we ate the food.  We were seriously disappointed."}
{"text":"The beef hot dog tasted like a regular pork hot dog. No\"snap\". Very disappointing. The fries were good. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy at all.  I was expecting something like Chicago dogs.  Pretty small also considering it's a hot dog place"}
{"text":"First time to RETRO Dog and I have to say we (the wife, daughter and myself) were pretty pleased. The craft sodas and floats were delicious. The atmosphere is comfortable and clean. The staff was friendly and very helpful. The food was overall good. We tried a footlong with cheese sauce, bacon, grilled onions, and chipotle mayo. Plenty of toppings, which went together well (would definitely order again). A retro dog, which was ok, but not really memorable. A \"Hula burger\", which was savory and sweet. The pineapple and the hula sauce work well together and really makes the difference on this burger (a definite order again). 2 different types of loaded fries (bacon and cheese, and jalapeño, sport peppers, and hula sauce), once again a generous amount of toppings.  The bacon and cheese are basically the standard in most places as it was fair here. The jalapeño, sport pepper, and hula sauce fries were a wonderful blend of tang and a gradual building of heat as we continued to enjoy them until they were gone. The only real drawback that we experienced was my daughters all beef dog was a little tough as it seemed to be overcooked. Overall a good experience, very casual, fair pricing, and an old style, drive in, relaxed atmosphere (eat inside or in your car and have a carhop tend to your needs). Definitely will stop in again when in the area. Good casual eats.

{"text":"Not what I was expecting. The \"retro\" style was only apparent by the colors of the restaurant. 1990s music was playing. 
The food was nothing to write home about. The same veggie hotdog can be bought from the local grocer. The vegetarian coney sauce was nothing fantastic.
Fries are not fresh cut. Not especially delicious.
On a positive note, my mud pie shake was delicious.
Friendly staff.
2 dogs+2 fries+2 shakes dine in= $20.81 
Overall, it was mediocre. Not worth the bill."}
{"text":"My family and I have loved Retro Dog for years now!! The staff is always friendly and the food is always great! There are so many options that sometimes it's a bit overwhelming, but it just means you have to go back again to try even more things! Plus they have a \"Retro Bomb\" which is a milkshake on top of a sundae...what could be better?? The other day I went and got the Retro Bean Burger, fries, and a Lucky Charms milkshake. The one thing to keep in mind, it is more expensive than your typical fast food. But the ingredients are all so fresh that personally I think it's worth it! 

You can either drive up or eat in, plus there's plenty of outdoor seating if you want to enjoy the outside!"}
{"text":"Best Chicago Dogs around. Vienna hot dogs would be better, but these are the best we've had in the area! Kind of pricey, but cheaper than driving to Chicago! ;)"}
{"text":"New drive in - classic style! Hosted my son's 8th birthday here and the staff and food is amazing. They brew their own pop, root beer and beer as well. Lots of special events and great burgers and dogs."}
{"text":"Yuck.   Onion rings were so greasy you needed to wring them out.   Chicken wings are on the menu but they don't actually serve them anymore.  The chicken tenders were burnt.   I would have sent them back but I had already waited so long I didn't have time to give them a second chance.  

Our food came out in three stages...I find this strange for a \"to go\" order.  I ordered a grilled chicken salad.  I asked what the house dressing was like.  The server said she had no idea because she had never had it.  The chicken was dry.

The kids liked the cheeseburger and chocolate shakes."}
{"text":"I went to this place with some friends (9.20.17) late night after a show at Blossom.  The restaurant was about to close inside but they let us in to have a beer even though they did not have to.  The staff was incredibly friendly and the beer they had on tap was fantastic.  BUT ON TO THE DOG.......BEST CHICAGO DOG IN CLEVELAND.  They actually use a poppy seed bun, they use real alien relish, they use sport peppers and not jalapenos (ALA DANS DOGS MEDINA) and most of all....the hot dog is fantastic. Not like happy dog where they load you with toppings to cover the inferior cased meat in the bun.  THIS PLACE IS LEGIT!"}
{"text":"BING BANG BOOM BABY! This place is baller. From the Chicken Sandwich to the Hot Dog to the kick Ass Shakes. I love this place! Gets me feeling craZy!!!! Killer stop after cruising the valley on your mid 90s hog.

Seedable-"}
{"text":"Owner could not even take the time to address concerns with management and bullying of employees. Terrible treatment, service, and management. Will NEVER get my business again."}
{"text":"Saw the reviews, thought I'd give it a try.  Choc malt was very good, thick and tasty.  Basic burger was good, tho I am a fan of pickle slices rather than the relish sort of pickle stuff they use.  In any case, the place is fine, food was good.  Did not go inside, so don't know the decor or cleanliness, etc.  Service was prompt, tho for a Saturday it was not busy."}
{"text":"I accidentally came across RETRO Dog and I'm so happy I did. 

They offer all sorts of hot dogs, hamburgers, wings, and fried delectable goodies. My current favorite white heat which is a pork and veal sausage in natural casing. The Chicago style is also a good choice. 

For something truly unique try the Bonsai burger. It has a burger patty, onion ring, a hot dog sliced down the center, and topped with a soy glaze. 

I'm really looking forward to some nicer weather and using the car hop service."}
{"text":"I commend this hot dog establishment for having so many veg options. I absolutely love their veggie dog with lentil chili sauce on top. Add Siracusa, and it's amazing! Their homemade root beer is bomb, too.

The service is great, everyone is very friendly. If it's your first time there, they'll give you a mini cone if their specialty ice cream--vanilla soft serve coated in chocolate and Carmel with a sprinkle of sea salt.  So amazing and the perfect size!"}
{"text":"Really great food! A nice variety of hot dogs, toppings, and sauces. They also have burgers and fries.  We ordered a footlong dog, a natural casing dog with bacon, and the home on the range fries. Amazing! The fries were a bit spicer than expected, so we \"had\" to order ice cream. Darn. :)

Overall, a really great little place. I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"I can't believe some of the complaints on here! Retro dog is awesome plain and simple, if you don't like something you picked out build your own meal! They offer that. Any who, never have had a bad meal, in fact we drive from North Royalton/Strongsville just to have there food! There hot dogs &&& burgers are to die for, seriously! The prices I don't mind at all either because I work at a family establishment and times are tough and so are soaring prices in the food industry! We love you retro dog!"}
{"text":"I recently dined here and was very disappointed. I have dined at many different hot dog establishments and this one was overpriced in my opinion. The fries were over seasoned, making them very salty and inedible. I enjoyed the snap of the hot dog, but didn't find it to be a hot dog I would throughly enjoy eating again. I also had a float, it was ok but I feel it was overpriced. 2 fries, 1 hot dog, 1 foot long and 2 floats equated to almost $30. Sorry to say, I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"If you're in Cuyahoga Falls and needing a quick bite, then most definitely give Retro Dog a chance. 

This is a great concept: old-school hot dogs, hamburgers, and sides. A simple menu with high-quality ingredients is right up my alley, and nothing at Retro Dog disappointed. They even have great veggie options for anyone who's not a meat lover. 

The stuff is super friendly, and the food comes out hot, fresh, and fast.

What's not to love, right?"}
{"text":"Delicious natural casing dogs with a variety of toppings, great milkshakes, awesome design. Very happy to have this new addition to the scene.

EDIT: After many return visits I can say the quality is consistent and the staff is always very friendly and competent. It has become my favorite \"fast food\" stop. Oh, and try the Retro Burger, it is, dare I say, better than a Swenson's Galley Boy. I know, blasphemy, but true."}
{"text":"I have two kids. 7 and 9. They love retro dog, so we gladly go regularly. While the service is a little limited, they more than make up for it with the quality of food. Overall, it is good place to go to get a great burger or dog and fantastic French fries. 

Overall, great spot for dinner. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Randomly found this place after a concert at Blossom and overall I enjoyed it.

Service is quick and food is out quickly as well. I like the fact that they bake their own buns, definitely creates a different experience.

Personally, I'm a chili cheese dog man and was sad to see none on the menu. Never had tried a coney dog prior, instinctively I ordered one as well as a Chicago dog. As far as taste goes, it was definitely tasty, just not in the sense that I'm use to. The Chicago dog was excellent and PACKED with overflowing toppings and tasted great!

My SO got a coney dog as well and pretty much shared the same experience. She's a chili cheese dog person too. I know.. we're meant to be together haha.

Fries were fresh and their onion rings were unique and intimidating but definitely delicious! Loved every bite.

And last but not least, their MILKSHAKES. Thick and flavorful, just like a traditional milkshake should be. Chocolatey goodness!!!!

I'd definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Delicious food with a cool atmosphere... 50's drive up. Lots of food for the price. Their coney sauce is amazing! Service was fast and girls were super nice. Recommend highly."}
{"text":"I must have hit this place on a bad day but the hotdogs were burnt like someone fried them in the deep fryer to warm them up. Very expensive for what we got."}
{"text":"Even though I planned my weekend in the Akron area around burger joints, beer and baseball, I couldn't pass up a hot dog place so close to my hotel.  You know, just for a snack.

For some reason, I was feeling adventurous that day.  I went against my instincts and, at the recommendation of Liana E, I went with the veggie dog.  I got mine topped simply with just the special mayo mustard.  I also went, of course, with a cup of the locally brewed root beer.  I debated the growler when I saw them on the counter, but it seemed a bit pricey (I think it was $15 for the growler full of root beer).

I took my cup and dog to go, but really just sat outside at one of the tables since it was such a nice day.  I unwrapped my dog and was surprised at it's size - bigger than I expected.  This was going to be more than a snack.  I took a bite.  And instantly my brain thought, \"This doesn't taste like a hot dog.\"  Then I remembered, duh, I ordered the veggie dog.  The taste was not unpleasant to my meat-loving sensibilities.  And the special mayo mustard, which I think was just mayo mixed with dijon mustard, had a nice flavor to it.  Though I'm not sure it was the best condiment for the veggie dog.  The root beer was aces.  I still regret not splurging on that growler.

I've vowed to return to the area and I'd like Retro Dog to be part of it.  If I enjoyed the veggie dog so much, I can only imagine how much I'd like the meat hot dogs.  I also saw some amazing looking onion rings I'd like to give a try as well as some tasty looking desserts.  Seems like my kind of place."}
{"text":"YUMMY!!!  My grandson and I were visiting a pumpkin patch in nearby Peninsula, and I used Yelp to find a nearby place for lunch.  I saw Retro Dog and immediately headed in that direction,   Cute place, kinda randomly located, old school drive-in restaurant, but very modern.  We opted to eat-in.  The restaurant is bright and the staff was super friendly.  I ordered my grandson a burger kids meal with applesauce and drink.  I ordered the Chicago Dog and onion rings.  We found a table and proceeded to wait for our order.  A short time later, we picked the order up at the counter.  The hotdog was huge, and topped with neon relish, dill pickle, celery salt and peppers, just like a real Chicago dog, it was delicious.  The onion rings were a bit greasy, but still very tasty.  My grandson really enjoyed his burger, as well.  We finished our meal with servings of ice cream custard, and it was oh, so tasty, perfect ending to a great lunch.  I would absolutely re-visit, when in the area."}
{"text":"The food I've had there is very good - the dogs are very good, and their burgers are even better!  The custard is to die for.  It's spoiled me to most other fast-food ice cream; it's thick, and they're very generous with their toppings.  I did not like their root beer - it was thick and not very good-tasting, but it's been a long time since I had it and it could have improved since then.  I have liked all of the other beverages I've had there.

My complaint is with their service.  We were there this weekend, and they made error after error.  We asked for our drinks in frosty mugs, and got them in plastic cups.  My wife ordered their fries and got onion rings.  The person taking my order (who I believe was one of the managers or owners) challenged me that my wife had indeed ordered fries (which, I think she'd know what she ordered!).  She then offered to make us more fries, which my wife declined, but the person insisted.  However, we never received any more fries, or any other attempts to correct the errors.  And, I should add, we were almost the only ones in the restaurant at the time.

The food is expensive, even with a Facebook discount they had going on, so, due to the service, it may be a while before we go back."}
{"text":"This is a cute place that my husband took me to one evening when he was unexpectedly craving a coney dog.  My husband doesn't particularly like hot dogs of any format so I was pleasantly surprised.

Although the coney dogs were good, they had yellow squirty cheese on them which was a little overpowering.  We were expecting a coney dog with meat sauce, stadium mustard and onions.  The hot dogs, although tasty, were miniscule and engulfed by the buns.  There was ample food for the money and the root beer was delicious!

Sadly the night we visited the place was a ghost town... it was a weekend evening and there were 3 cars total in the parking lot.  

One pitfall is that we drove our convertible - it was a beautiful evening weather-wise.  This caused problems with the drive-in tray that attaches to the car window.  The trays at Retro Dog are designed for car windows which run straight up and down - unlike any car today that is aerodynamic and has slanted windows.  Our server nearly dumped our dinner in our laps when trying to attach the ill-designed tray to our window.  This situation was followed by a perplexed and confused look from the car-hop who offered no solution other than to hand the tray to my husband and I so that we could \"figure it out\" ourselves.  Unlike Swenson's (which obviously plans for car-side service year-round) Retro Dog doesn't offer (or our teenage waitress didn't know about) a special tray designed to fit INSIDE the vehicle.

IF we visit again we'll be eating inside.  Much ado about nothing."}
{"text":"Come prepared and bring a book. This review is for Labor Day Monday... I know... it was a couple of week's ago... but hopefully ya'll will find this helpful to temper your expectations.

The service issues for us were not a lack of people... there were 6 individuals all together that delivered food to the 8 - 10 cars that were there at all times during the 45+ min from pull in to finish paying.

We did not go inside... and there were 3 or 4 cars in the outer area but there were plenty of spaces so it shouldn't have been packed inside... we never saw any patrons come or go from the inner restaurant area.

We pulled up with our lights on and having already discussed the menu before hand... we read the reviews and wanted to head off an ordering delay... and it took ~2 min for the order person to get to us and ask if we needed a menu... she was willing and able to take our order right then and there.  She did not read back the order (should have been a warning flag) but we were so happy to start the process quick we didn't think of a read back

3 min later (yes... we timed it) a different server came out and delivered our drinks... by hand... no tray... she had to go back in and retrieve more drinks for the car next to us... they wanted napkins... she didn't have them... so back in... get napkins... run out.

I watched all 6 of the servers... they all have aprons... NONE of them have straws or napkins or spoons or anything in them... why do they have them???

Meanwhile... 2 cars had pulled in... with their lights on... and none of the food delivery folks asked them if they needed a menu... that is when we realized that there was only ONE order taker??? Puzzling again... they had the people... but I guess since they can't remember napkins, spoons and straws they don't get to take orders???

We had 10 more min to wait for our tray of food after the drinks were delivered.

Hubby got a Retro Bomb... a milkshake / sundae all in one... I didn't bother to take a picture since he chose vanilla ice cream with a vanilla shake on top.  There was plenty of chocolate sauce in the bottom... and it took him quite awhile to finish it... so he was amused during the wait at least.

I ordered my Carolina Dog with the Mayo Mustard combo sauce... just to be sure I didn't get too much mustard... the dog was snappy, the bun was crunchy on the inside and otherwise soft. The slaw was nothing memorable, but not too soupy either.

Hubby ordered the foot long with cheese sauce... it came out with just shredded cheese sprinkled over it... the hot dog was snappy and well grilled... the bun was stale... several days old kind of stale... the bun needed gooey cheese sauce to save it.... alas... it was terrible.

The fries were crisp yet creamy, we love the natural cut with the skin still on... they were COVERED in salt... and by the time we were done so were we from trying to brush the excess salt off... but having done that they tasted great.

The onion rings were really crunchy, well cooked, and the sauce cut the grease.

We had a 14 min wait after we turned our lights on for the same order girl to come back and give us our total... we handed her our card... waited another 10 min to get the receipt back for signage... and tip... no details... did we pay more for  cheese sauce that we didn't get? Who knows?

We live 2 miles from this location... we will likely go back... but next time we'll try inside."}
{"text":"Nice little \"drive-in\" diner. It's literally in the middle of nowhere but worth the trip. We went on the behest of my brother in law, and couldn't have been more satisfied. Actually ordered a couple hot dogs and the wife got a burger. The meat was seasoned well (pause) and the dogs were grilled perfectly. Ordered the loaded fries (tip: you can go for the regular size portion if sharing with another person, it's plenty!) and was stuffed the rest of the day and we ate there at 5PM. Staff was super friendly and helpful with our order.

Will definitely be back. To get more food, because why not?!"}
{"text":"Love me some RetroDog!!! It's a great place to do drive up, or go in and sit. I like the dogs, but my favorite is the Hula burger, their home-made root beer, and a retro dip for dessert."}
{"text":"My husband said he wanted to try this place, so we ended up going for dinner last night. UNDERWHELMED.
We ordered the Beast footlong dog and 2 White Hors because I loves brats and stadium mustard along with an iced tea and a strawberry shake...$19...hmmm...no sides included...ok.
It took about 10 min to get our dogs, which looked tasty but ended up be tasteless. My bratwurst has no flavor at all, the stadium mustard wasn't spicy at all, even the diced onions on top seemed flavorless. My husbands footlong was also underwhelming and left us both hungry and looking for something more. Though there were only 2 other patrons all the tables were dirty and the entire staff was sitting behind the counter hanging out instead of checking on tables or cleaning...we won't be back"}
{"text":"Retro Root Beer in a FROSTY MUG!
Super creamy, real Frozen Custard! 

Burgers, Dogs and Fries with an overwhelming array of topping choices. 
We visited on a Sunday evening, and ate inside. 
Everything was fresh and delicious. Service was spot-on!

The Onion Rings were a highlight for me... Made fresh to order, tender inside, light and crisp fried tempura batter outside. I'm my opinion... They could NOT be better!
Highly recommend that you give RETRO DOG a try!"}
{"text":"This was my favorite restaurant in town.....but I'll never come back again.  No more whole wheat hamburger buns....and that was 90% of the reason I came.

The last one I was here, they made my kids burger wrong.

The time before that, there was a huge mold spot on my kids ft long hot dog, that we almost didn't notice.

It's a shame.... but n 3 visits, it's gone from a favorite, to a \"never again\".

There are plenty of places to get a burger on a white bread bun....nothing special."}
{"text":"Dogs were OK at best. I got 2. Dogs were smallish. With all the toppings, dog got lost in the mix. The loaded fries were pretty good and the server/car hop was pleasant and attentive. My friend enjoyed her burger."}
{"text":"I am a vegetarian. The veggie dog was not that good. It tasted a bit...old or dry maybe. The veggie chili was also a bit dry and very salty. There were lentils in it, but there just wasn't enough moisture to make it that enjoyable or enough cheese to save it."}
{"text":"I have to rate my visit as a 3 this evening (unfortunately). And really that's pushing it. The hotdogs were excellent; however, the fries were over salted and oily, the onion rings were dripping in grease. Very little onion and way too much batter. Please, please change your oil! The root beer floats - well let's break that down; root beer was great but the custard ice-cream seemed to have ice chips in it. Not creamy, but \"ice milky\". Lastly Retro Dog should have \"Retro\" music. Stick with the dogs and you may enjoy your visit."}
{"text":"Seems like a good idea, but overall a disappointment. Only went because we had a Groupon and it honestly was still overpriced for a hot dog. It's sort of cute but definitely not as good as I was anticipating."}
{"text":"The Red Hot was very soggy. My bun fell apart. The Chicago Dog has good flavor, but the wiener was nothing to write home about. Overpriced and flies all over."}
{"text":"Retro Dog is the hottest dog in the Northampton Twp. part of Cuyahoga Falls. They serve two things: hot dogs and burgers. They even have vegan varieties of hot dogs and burgers on the menu. If you don't like that, there's something terribly wrong with you. From there, you can order fries, chili, a milkshake, a 50s-style root beer or orange cream soda, or even onion rings. All this in a Sonic-style drive-in atmosphere with a significant indoor dining room.

My favorite thing on the menu is the Banzai Dog, a hot dog topped with bacon, shredded lettuce, and the spicy-yet-delicious Banzai Sauce. I don't remember the name of the food item, but my grandma ordered some fries with pickle relish, and it was delish.

Go here before a concert at Blossom, or before your big presentation at work. Your taste buds will thank you."}
{"text":"Great concept.  Food is good-fun menu and terrific custard desserts.  Drive-in service as well as indoor/outdoor seating.  Firepit for cooler nights.
Plan on visiting many more times.   Onion rings are fantastic, hot dogs are good, chicken sandwiches are great!"}
{"text":"Save your money. Onion rings were dripping in grease! Hamburger had no flavor. My third time here it's good in theory, just not in execution."}
{"text":"I really wanted this place to be amazing. The food is just okay. Nothing too spectacular. I didn't find a WOW factor. I do feel like it is REALLY expensive. For my boyfriend, daughter and I, we can drop $25 easily and thats not getting a lot of food. At all. I do find the service to be hit or miss too."}
{"text":"The restaurant had plenty of car hop parking, but it was a bit too cold so we ate inside. Clean and bright, the seating area was filled with customers. The place is a good spot to bring the kids. They offer happy hour discounts during the week. 

Kudos to the very helpful young lady at the counter. She enthusiastically reviewed menu highlights and made recommendations. 

I had a Chicago dog with onion rings. I was pleasantly surprised to see Thirsty Dog's Irish Setter Red on tap. The all beef hot dog was good and faithful to the Chicago style down to the dill spear, poppy seed bun, relish, sport peppers and celery salt. The onion things were crisp and perfectly (lightly) battered. 

When again in the area I'd be happy to stop by to try a different dog."}
{"text":"Chicago dog was delicious.  My husband had a double cheeseburger was probably the best cheeseburger Ive had in while."}
{"text":"Here to tell you I think this place is off the hook!  I was excited to try it & was not disappointed.  At first I thought they were a little pricey, but put things in perspective.  The ingrediants are of higher quality than you would think.

Went on a Sunday afternoon & it wasn't crowded at all.  Four of us sat at the counter and talked to the friendly staff members the whole time.  I ordered the Chicago dog & really loved it!  Boyfriend got the Carolina dog & he loved it!  The boys got the Coney dogs and wanted more.  Nom, Nom, Nom...

Few things worth noting... I am a designer and I was digging everythig about this place!  The layout, the lighting, the surface materials, the graphic design, etc.  I can really appreciate all of the nice, clean details this place offers.  I even took a pic of the rest room!  A+ to the design team!

They even have nice, thick, soft napkins which were like a luxury!  I want to work here just so I can get a red pair of Converse! Seriously,  I love their uniforms, very cool.  If they sold their shirts I would buy one!  Love the artwork & colors.  Again, well done & kudos to the artist!"}
{"text":"Huge disappointment. Great concept, great atmosphere. However, food was less than. Hot dog and fries were overcooked to the point of being burnt. The onion rings were the only good part of our meal. It was sad as our expectations were high."}
{"text":"Overall a good experience. 
The coney sauce is like a cincy chili so if you like chili with a nutmeggy flavor then you will love retro dog  coney sauce .

Fun flavor additions. For example they have a burger with a grilled pineapple topping and you can get a hot dog ON your burger. 
I thought the burger was very good. It's thinner patty, but I like that. Fresh bun. 

Good service. Bring cash to tip. Weird logo."}
{"text":"Retro Dog is a cool place to stop if you are out in the Cuyahoga Valley or at Blossom and feel like a snack or some ice cream.  Kind of separate from anything else, you will see a large take out with parking out front where you can have the food brought out to your car or go in to the cool dining area.  The decor is bright and in your face in a good way, kind of a very modern expression of a 50's diner.  The menu consists of hot dogs, sandwiches, sides and plenty of ice cream based desserts.  

I have had the veggie retro dog, the fries, onion rings and a couple of milk shakes, overall the food is good, not great.  The veggie retro dog is a pretty nice veggie hot dog with veggie coney sauce, mustard and onions on a wheat bun.  The mild hot dog has a nice snap but it could have used more of the toppings, especially the coney sauce, which is a mild veggie chili.  The french fries are fresh cut, but were not terribly crisp.  The onion rings missed the mark with the fried batter overpowering the flavor of the onions and they seemed a bit overcooked.

The 2 milkshakes I tried were the best items I had at Retrodog; prepared fresh with soft serve ice cream.  The flavor selection is extensive and they have some unique flavors for you to try.  The chocolate banana was a nice balance of the banana milk shake with hot fudge; the salted caramel was a nice balance of sweet with a hint of salt.  Overall good shakes, especially using soft serve ice cream as the base.

Retro Dog is probably not worth a special trip or the place for a full meal, but if you are in the area and need a snack it is worth a try."}
{"text":"Best hot dog place in town.   They have great service and you either can be curbed served or dine in at the restaurant.   It's my favorite place to get a hot dog."}
{"text":"What can I say about the food. It's awesome. Great family atmosphere. The onion rings are amazing and even the chicken sandwich is good. But skip that, grab a dog."}
{"text":"Went to their grand opening on the June 17th and despite the fact that they were slammed I cannot say enough about the customer service and hustle the entire Retro Dog team exhibited.  The wait was long due to the insane amount of guests but have every expectation that their service will be no less than amazing going forward.  The atmosphere is bright and upbeat with an updated diner feel.  The original artwork speaks for itself.

I tried the Retro Dog as I am a HUGE fan of Coney dogs.  The sauce was different and sweeter than the \"traditional\" Coney sauce but a good surprising spin on an old original.  Toppings were ample and the natural casing hot dog cooked to perfection.  I ordered the Coney fries to go with and I may have overdosed on the Coney aspect of things and think they might ne better paired with a different dog.  Delicious all the same.

The custard cone with the salted chocolate dip and caramel was ridiculous.  Although full from my meal, I still couldn't help but finish.  The salted chocolate adds the perfect savory to the caramel's and custard's sweet.  Retro Dog is definitely worth a visit and I plan on returning multiple times to try the entire menu."}
{"text":"Drove by after a long run and we were curious... No expectations...and were super happy after! We were pretty hungry, order a Carolina dog and Chicago dog (yum yum).  The all beef dogs are excellent and they have a good choice of hot dogs types.  The Buckeye shake was delightful, but we love PB and chocolate so you can't go wrong.  The fries were basic.  Would stop back if ever in the area again!"}
{"text":"1st try we sat in parking lot with lights on for 15 minutes.  No service, no one even looked our way.  The only people waited on were the ones under the canopy.  No signs anywhere that they only have service under awning.  Swenson's services their whole lot!

2nd visit I got a spot under the canopy.  Waitress came to car and wanted me to order.  No menu boards, no menu, I ordered 2 dogs and Onion Rings.  Ordered 1 all beef and 1 natural with the same topping and an order of onion rings to go.  Both dogs barely warm and 1 had the correct toppings, the other one had I don't know what on it, some sort of hot relish maybe?  Onions rings were the greasiest I've ever had!  Great concept that failed to deliver!!"}
{"text":"When I drove by I had high hopes.  Not so much after stopping in.   The dogs were just ok.  I got the White Hot and a regular with Coney sauce.  The wife got a Kraut dog.  We each had an order of fries.  Mine were the garlic Parmesan hers were the rosemary.   We couldn't tell the difference between the two.  There was not enough salt/flavoring on either of them to tell the difference.  The Coney sauce tasted burnt.  The Kraut dog was just okay.  The white hot was just fine. And last of all the prices were very high.  We wont be back which is a shame.  The decor is great. The service was fine.    The place could be great it just needs some work and better quality control and 15 to 20% lower pricing."}
{"text":"Excellent local restaurant for grilled American fare. The selection of burgers, hot dogs, shakes and fried foods is just incredible. There are also vegetation options (dogs and burgers) which is greatly appreciated! The place is clean and neat, and the service is quick and modernized (they use iPhones to ring you out). One minor issue - the hot dogs and burgers are great, but the buns themselves are either too big or too soggy.  The food is incredible, but a better bun makes a even better sandwich."}
{"text":"My husband and I are both vegetarian and this place has the BEST veggie burgers and hot dogs. My husband is picky about veggie burgers and the black bean burger blew his mind. I grabbed a veggie dog and loved the choice of toppings. The fries were delicious and generously portioned. We will be coning back for sure."}
{"text":"This was my first visit and I was definitely NOT impressed. The service was quick, but not necessarily competent and the food was overpriced. *On a side note, if you order root beer with your combo, be prepared to receive a 12oz drink instead of the 16oz that supposedly comes with it."}
{"text":"Coney fries and a carolina dog. Go now and eat. Retro dog is a great local drive in restaurant! They have nice indoor seating too! Fun, casual atmosphere! Thirsty dog brewing even makes a beer special for retro dog! Don't forget your growler!"}
{"text":"This was a nice change of pace from our typical road trip meal stops, but it was nothing that blew my socks off. The dog was fairly tasteless (I'd rather have my store-bought Hebrew National any day) and while the toppings were decent, it was nothing that made me say WOW, I WANT ANOTHER. I tried the home brew root beer and again, it was decent, but I like Barqs better. The best part of the meal was the fries. So, an A-OK stop and if I lived close I'd definitely try other menu options...but as a one-off stop, it didn't thrill me as much as I'd hoped."}
{"text":"It's an unusually warm day, almost 60 degrees, and I thought you need to go eat at a drive-in and take in the balmy day. I've been to Retro Dog once, not long after it opened, and I wasn't impressed but I thought give it another shot. This was going to be a 3-star review until after I finished eating, turned on my lights, waited 15 minutes, then had to CALL them to come out and take my money. The young man really was giving good curb service until the end. He was very apologetic, but come on, he saw my lights on as did another young man. They took care of 3 other cars and ignored me. Anyway, as to the food, it was just ok and pricey for the quality, $10.55 for a bacon cheeseburger, small fries, and small Coke. Nothing I couldn't have made at home better. No next time for Retro Dog."}
{"text":"I just loved this place! Neat atmosphere and the entire staff was friendly and helpful! I got the Hula Burger and BLT Fries - loved the hula sauce and burger! The fries were very good too - but next time I'd get the fries with hula sauce on them. 

They have very cool ice cream options too! One of cups has a sundae at the bottom and a milk shake poured over it!

I can't wait to take my family here! These kind of burger/hot dog joints are my new favorite places to find!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Retro Dog for a couple of years. The first time I came here, I didn't like the hot dog but I ADORED the chocolate shake! Months later, I returned and started getting what has since become my go-to order: a retro burger with bacon and no shredded pickle, cheese fries with ranch, and a cream soda. They are INCREDIBLE!! They caramelize and chop the onions and they get the bacon nice and crispy before chopping it as well, which is MUCH better than simple bacon strips and thick rings of plain onions. Their food is so good that my appetite never lasts for dessert, but when I make a point of getting one their chocolate shakes are thick, creamy, and rich. The service is always friendly and courteous no matter who it is. You really can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Came after work around 5 on a weekday. There was only one other car present at the old school drive up eatery. 

Ordered the Retro Dog coney and onion rings and a kid's meal cheeseburger with fries. Our order was filled quickly. The food highlight was the fresh cut fries! The onion rings were great, but very greasy (I know, they're cooked in grease, but still). The milkshakes we got were delicious and if for no other reason, I'll return for a strawberry banana milkshake."}
{"text":"Was down in the area for some hiking and remembered seeing some good things about this place. Retro Dog is really in the middle of nowhere which explains why it wasn't so busy but easy enough to get to once you know what streets to take. The car hoppers came out very quick, gave us the extensive menu, and came back out just as quickly when we were ready to order. The shakes were DELICIOUS and the hot dogs were very good too. Good choice of bun as well. The fries with cheese sauce and bacon were also very good.

Overall, my wife and I definitely enjoyed it. We put it right up next to Swenson's as one of our favorite places to go for food. Very good!"}
{"text":"I tried this place today and it was really good! I ordered the retro veggie dog and cheese fries. The retro dog was really good it came with chili, mustard and onions. Being an all vegetarian meal I was pretty pleased. The cheese fries were fantastic! Crispy and the cheese was yum! We will be back."}
{"text":"I'm happy to go for a 4 here even though there are some caveats (they are mostly preference).

This place is cool. The decorations and dining area are engaging and inventive and has that 50's diner feel. Its a neat family atmosphere an the menu has enough depth to please the non-hotdog eaters in your picky group, too.

I tried a good sampling the first time we went - the Chicago, the Bonzai, the Retro and the burger. I've only re-tried the Retro. The natural casing dog is the best they have there in my opinion.

The home-brewed rootbeer is super-tasty and the shakes were good, too.

This is a fun afternoon or evening out with the family place that we will definitely try again!"}
{"text":"The bomb.com good beer, Great onion rings, and killer hotdogs. Very nice staff and I would recommend this place to a friend. When I asked what was good they didn't give me the generic answer of everything. They told me their onion rings are special and that they are."}
{"text":"Did a Hula burger, it was different but pretty good. Onion rings are awesome! Coleslaw was not all that good."}
{"text":"This place was great. I don't understand the poor reviews. One of the best hot dogs I've ever had. Milkshake was solid as well.

And the poor waitress braved a monsoon to take our order quickly. 

Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I've been to Retro Dog several times including before, on and after the grand opening on June 17th. I'm not sure what people expect from a brand new concept restaurant in this area that's not even a franchise. I, myself, being a reasonable and realistic person who also manages people for a living, was prepared for the imperfections in service. The great part is there's already significant progress being made. 

The food is really good. I've had the retro dog, the white hot, and kraut dog (so far, my fav), and am starting to have some fun building my own. The bean burger is very interesting and tasty! The veggie dog is also really good. I love that they have healthier, vegetarian options. But the ultimate is the Retro Dip. This is a cone of amazing deliciousness. Who knew I'd look forward to the very bottom of the cone as much as the top?"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been a couple of time.  I'd actually lean more toward a 3 and a half star rating.  I like their hot dogs, but their buns aren't particularly good - kind of like mushy white bread.  I love the concept, I just wish it was a little better."}
{"text":"Cool LOOKING place but about $25 for 2 chili dogs 2 fries and some sodas was WAYYYYY TOOO MUCH MONEY and while it was a cool looking place....I would NOT go back only because of the sky high prices."}
{"text":"Do not do it.  Don't go.  At least I won't again.  Waiting 30 minutes for 2 friggen' hot dogs and fries on a Monday night.  2 other cars there, so they weren't busy.  When the food came it was cold.  So they made it and let it sit there, undelivered, for who knows how long.  And we ordered drinks, which they just never delivered.  We drove away in disgust, not desiring to wait an additional 10 minutes for our cola"}
{"text":"Good custard ice cream and fancy smancy shakes! I LOVE the INTERIOR design of this place and the whole color theory theme! I am an artist so I can really appreciate that sort of thing. The hotdogs were not the best to me but a big fan of the sweets here!"}
{"text":"1st trip here .. my husband had 2 dogs w/yellow mustard .. I had 1 w/chili + yellow mustard + 1 with chili + yellow mustard .. we both enjoyed our dogs .. but the stand out was the battered onion rings .. totally delicious .. wish we had gotten a large order to split but w/2 dogs each we wanted to pace ourselves .. root beer float & black cherry soda were the chosen beverages .. we will be back .. not only for more onion rings but perhaps to try a burger next time .. a bit of a drive from our home in Cleveland but a decent road trip to treat ourselves every so often .. far exceeded our expectations & now there is no need to go to Sonic ever again .. thank God!"}
{"text":"Great service, OK food.  It seemed like everything was just a little off.  I had the Retro Dog and onion rings and the hubs got the Carolina Dog with fries.  The hot dog itself was really good... Mellow taste, nice snap... but the coney sauce was a turn off.  Very sweet, not much spice.  My husband said his Carolina dog was good, but he said he would try something else next time.  The onion rings really had me excited because they looked perfect... they weren't.  The spices in the tempura overwhelmed any onion flavor that might have been there and they were SO GREASY!  I ate one and a half rings and had to stop.  The fries were just OK too and needed to have salt added to them.  They had a really nice natural potato flavor but they tasted like they'd been sitting around for a while, which seems implausible considering how busy they were.  We also ordered the root beer and the flavor was not unpleasant, but it was very flat.  Considering how very sweet it is, it could have used more carbonation.  

I would like to return to Retro Dog and try a dog with just mustard.  Of course, we also need to try the custard!"}
{"text":"I look up and see waitress petting a dog. Thank God we got our food first. Then I see the owner and a child feeding the dog with the same hand they are eating with. The waitress ask is there anything else she can get us my grand girl said she wanted a refill on her drink. I said no thank you and can we get that other waitress. I have no problem about you being a dog lover but don't force me to be one"}
{"text":"Good hot dogs. Good root beer. Not a chain. Good times."}
{"text":"Nice variety of dogs and burgers. Place has tasty vegetarian alternatives. Come alone, with friends, family or just you and the kids."}
{"text":"Very disorganized and slow.  Cute idea, but the service needs work."}
{"text":"First of all it took me 20 minutes almost to get one hot dog with chili and onions. I think the chili is just okay and the hot dog is just okay. Nothing special about this place from what I can tell but it is better than the other hot dog at ate at another venue. To be honest I'd more than likely come back but it's not my favorite"}
{"text":"Overall fantastic place. The decor is very cool and the food is good. Even if you are not a fan of hot dogs, they do have burgers (including a black bean burger!) and chicken options. I had the original retro dog- diced onions, chili, and cheese. It was quite yummy. There was a hint of cinnamon in the chili that I could have done without but it was still delicious! My combo also came with a side of home-style fries which were surprisingly crunchy as well as tasty. 

Retro dog also offers a variety of retro sodas- cream soda, black cherry, root beer and so on. The root beer is actually their own recipe and made locally. It was a sweeter take on root beer than most places, so if you like sweet pop, you will definitely be a fan :) plus it comes in a frosted mug, just like all root beer should!

Customer service was fine, seems they have worked out any kinks they may have had since opening earlier this summer. I know I will be going back!"}
{"text":"Traveling through town, we were looking for an inexpensive, quick, unique place for lunch. This is certainly it.  Wonderful hot dogs and great frozen custard. The atmosphere is great but the highlight had to be the onion rings. Wonderful batter, crispy and delicious. Would certainly recommend this place. Our family of 4 ate lunch for about $34 without custard."}
{"text":"Good food. Way over priced as everything is extra. Tried copying Teds Hotdogs in Western New York. I'll wait for a road trip back home to get my dogs at a much more reasonable price."}
{"text":"I went in for Lunch and it was AMAZING!!!  Not lo cal but amazing.  I wanted everything on the menu.  I had the Chicago style dog with was perfect and the onion rings.  Everything was made super fresh.  The batter on the rings with the spicy sauce was great.  I really wanted to get a malt or a shake.  I am going back soon this week.  I'm only here till Friday.  The service was fast and friendly especially the lady who rung us in.  Love the concept I want my own in Portland..."}
{"text":"Great local joint with an old fashion car hop service or eat in there dining area bar stools and tables.

They have great dogs, burgers made to perfection with all kinds of toppings.  The dogs are great love the Chicago dog best in the area.  The shakes and ice cream can't go wrong and try the old fashion root beer float."}
{"text":"I was fixing a computer in Stow, Ohio when I happened upon Retro Dog. I saw the sign and I had to stop. Besides, I was really hungry and it was dinner time.

I pulled in, turned on my headlights, and promptly received a menu from a dashing waitress. I looked at some yelp pictures and then I decided to get a Chicago dog and a red hot. I turned my headlights back on and a few minutes later a different dashing waitress appeared at my car window. I said I'd like a Chicago dog and a red hot. Then I asked if I could get them both footlong and she said, \"Sure!\" About 10 minutes later, the first dashing waitress arrived with my hot dogs. I started with the Chicago first and I noticed it was made from quality ingredients. The hot dog was hot and delicious and the toppings were tasty too. It seemed to be the closest thing I've had to an authentic Chicago hot dog. I'd definitely order this again. 

The red hot wasn't so great. It was very spicy with an annoying flavor profile. I thought that I would love its sauerkraut, but it was just kind of bitter and the mustard added to the negative effect. And I like mustard! I didn't like it and it was too spicy for me. I definitely won't be ordering that one again.

I'd like to stop back and try a burger, some fries, maybe some onion rings, and a milk shake. That will probably take two or three trips, however.  

Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Heard this place was terrible from a family friend & wish I would've taken his opinion to heart. My fiance & I were scouting Retro Dog out for possibly having their food truck for our wedding reception but they instantly failed. 

I am a french fries queen! I can tell you who has the best fresh cut, frozen, sweet potato, etc fries around and Retro Dog is not one of them. They claim to be fresh cut but they tasted a little frozen. My fries were not raw but were definitely not cooked long enough (no crisp, just limp d*ck). Sadly, bathing them in a small cup of salt & malt vinegar didn't save the day. 

Then my fiance ordered their Chicago & White dog but said they weren't very good & he could've made better at home. He also ordered their tempura onion rings- F**king disgusting!!!! The onions inside were cut way too thick & therefore weren't cooked all the way.  The batter tasted like idk what- a really bad knock off of Arby's curly fries &, again, was undercooked & greasy. Even if I had just gotten off of a crappy 12 hour shift at work with no break and an hour long drive home I wouldn't eat their food. Less than 15 minutes later I got heart burn so...


As for their service- not bad, but their Root beer float was the only good thing that I had. But i must admit, I love the concept & the decor- just not the food!"}
{"text":"Love this place, cool decor, great menu and friendly staff.  We go out of our way just to eat here.  Most likely one of the rare instances where a hot dog place also offers great burgers, shakes and even a veggie option!"}
{"text":"I didn't get a hot dog, but I did get the ice cream sandwich.  I would give just the ice cream sandwich five stars!  The butter pecan and caramel cookie ice cream sandwich was recommended to me by the cashier.  She did not lead me astray.  Two huge cookies with ice cream (which was at least 1.5 inches thick).  I would go back just for that delightful treat.  
I also got the chocolate malt, which was very good, but not great.  
Everything else looked decent in the pictures, but I did not partake."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a fun little place to go every once in a while, go here. They have all sorts of good quality hot dogs and hamburgers; including veggie style ones. The drinks and milkshakes are awesome, too. The ambiance is very cheesy, but it works. I want to write more about this place, but there really isn't a lot to say. It's a hot dog place...

You'll enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is the part of being a food adventurer that bites you in the ass.  This has got to be the 2nd worse place I have ever been too.  There dogs are no better than what you buy at the store, so save yourself time and money and just go to the grocery store.  For 4.29 I got a foot long dog that was saturated in crap!  I couldn't find the dog at first and had to get a spoon and scrape everything off.  There were more topping than dog.  If you don't like toasted buns, don't go here.  I HATE toasted hot dog buns WITH A PASSION and they do it here, without asking if that's what you want.  What I make at home was also more tastier.

I also asked for a strawberry shake, because, really.... how can you mess up a strawberry shake.  Well, they did.  It wasn't that cold.  It was lumpy with what you might call frozen strawberries but it wasn't cold or thick at all.  Almost as if they let ice cream thaw, then scooped it into a glass and let it sit for awhile.  EWWWWWWW!

Save yourself trouble and got to McDonalds if you're really in a hurry and can't go to the grocery store.

The staff is ok, but not on my list of nicest people in the world.  I got the feeling there were more concerned with sales than pleasing people.  Small parking and one car runner ran into me on the way in.  
DON'T GO HERE!"}
{"text":"I appreciate what they're trying to do here. They went all-in on the retro drive-in look and unique variations on the dog-and-burger menu. 

I've tried three different dogs and one burger; fries and rings. The meat and fixings are fine -- not spectacular, but OK. On my most recent visit, the poppy seed bun for the Chicago dog was distinctly stale. (I've run into a similar problem at some other places, where they don't sell many Chicago dogs so the special poppy seed buns sit around for far too long.)

I'll echo what at least one other commenter said: The sodas are bizarrely small portions. They boast about their own root beer. In house, it comes in what looks like a nice-sized chilled glass mug, but turns out to be largely ice. I got a to-go version one, and it was a tiny cup, again with the ice -- and filled to the brim so that spilling was inevitable."}
{"text":"I've been driving past Retro Dog for years, and finally had a chance to stop and try it out. I had the original dog, which was just about as good as a hot dog can get. Their Cajun fries also went great with their Root Beer. My wife's favorite part was the chocolate milk shake, which we'll be back for again."}
{"text":"This was our second time here.  The first time we came the service was slow and they kept forgetting parts of our order.  It wasn't even busy.  The coney sauce wasn't very good on our first visit so this time ordered our stuff without it which was much better.  The service this time was better but we also ate inside too.  Their custard and fries were great both visits!"}
{"text":"It breaks my food-loving heart to see this place dogged (no pun intended) like this. Listen, I have been to Retro Dog about a dozen (or more?) times now, and I've never received anything but incredibly friendly service and food that is better, by far, than anything else that I've eaten in Ohio. 

I think the problem is that this isn't Swenson's. I like Swenson's as much as anyone, but let's face it: the food there is a lot of pre-frozen crap that gets dumped out of a bag and into a deep fryer and then put in a smelly wax bag and brought to your car. Retro Dog isn't Swenson's, and it can't be as cheap either (except for at Happy Hour! more on that later.) Retro Dog serves some of the freshest, handmade food, and it just costs more to do things the right way. I would pay (and have paid) more than double for this quality. 

But for those of you who find it a little pricey, there's Happy Hour now! From 3 pm to 5 pm every weekday, the natural casing dog, the white hot dog, the hamburger, and chocolate and vanilla shakes are half price! It comes out to less than a buck fifty each for the dogs and less than two bucks for the shakes. Even if you only go for those things and only during those times, it's more than worth your money. 

And let's not even get started on the custard. There is absolutely NOWHERE in the greater Akron area with better frozen treats. They are to die for, and the banana split has often had me literally thanking God. 

More than any of this, though, the staff are wonderful, and even the owners are there working tirelessly every day to make sure that their product is great and that their guests are happy. They will literally treat you like family. That's not even a platitude. My roommate and I met one of the owners' parents one evening. It's a family business, and absolutely everyone involved in the daily operations of Retro Dog has been wonderful to us.

So now I'm going to beg. I am not affiliated with Retro Dog in any way, and they have never asked me to shill for them, but I tell everyone I know about them, and every time a friend from out-of-town comes to visit, I take them there, and today I'm going to tell you, too.

Please, if you've never been to Retro Dog, give it a chance. If you care about good food and local, family-owned business, please spend a lunch there. And if you've been there before but didn't think it was great, go back. Go during happy hour, or try something else. Don't leave without something made with custard. And if you feel like it, tell them that the two fat girls sent you. They'll give you the same warm reception that they gave us the first time, and that and the food will keep you coming back. Trust me."}
