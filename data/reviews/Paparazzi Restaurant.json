{"text":"Nice Italian restaurant in the South Side known for live bluesy jazz bands.  If you are going for dinner, I recommend showing up early, before the band starts.  There is an upper level and the main entrance level.  Upstairs is great for a large group, or an intimate dinner for two.  The downstairs area includes the bar and a more relaxed atmosphere.  Typical Italian food.  Nothing fancy or outrageous, but nothing memorable either.  The food is good and doesn't disappoint, but don't expect to find anything out of this world to Yelp about.  Coming from San Francisco, it was upsetting to enter a restaurant that still permits smoking.  I usually avoid a facility that permits lighting up.  Smoking upsets the taste of your food, aggravates my sinuses and makes my clothes stink."}
{"text":"I guess the reviews on here are somewhat mixed, but I love this restaurant.  Their ravioli is delicious.  Although, now that I think about it, I'd probably eat ravioli off the floor of a prison."}
{"text":"If you are out drinking on a weekend night, stop by outside and indulge in a slice (or three) of $1 pizza.  It's quite good.  Otherwise, I haven't eaten here"}
{"text":"Paparazzi's is an Italian bar and restaurant located on the South Side. While the bar downstairs often hosts live bands after 9pm and gets quite crowded, the restaurant upstairs maintains a relatively calm and even romantic atmosphere. This is a good place for a candlelight dinner for two or even a group of ten friends.   The fare is Italian and done well, but not excellent. Be prepared for the copious amounts of garlic (love it!).  The menu is large and covers the Italian bases as you would expect of a good Italian restaurant. There is never room for dessert, but in theory, Paparazzi's does have it.   If you enjoy Italian meals, definitely stop by Paparazzi's."}
{"text":"Wow.  I don't know what has changed.  Sure there was a stabbing a few months ago, sure someone died...but you can't blame that on the establishment necessarily.  Maybe people stopped going?  I was there on a Sunday night ~9:30pm.  It was dead inside and I think we were the only ones eating dinner, but we did call ahead to see if they were still serving and we were told til 12 or 1.    I ordered a pizza.   GF ordered pesto farfalle.    We received bread & oil with the meal.  Bread was 2-3 days old, & stale.  The oil was...vegetable oil with salt & pepper.  Really??  Pizza is still good, but was different than last review.    The farfalle was wayyy overcooked; it was like mush.  Her dinner came with a salad...salad dressing choices included blue cheese & ranch.  That's it.  No other choices...and our waitress didn't even think they had ranch.  Got a side of balsamic vinegar instead.    I also got a beer with dinner... $4 for a bottle of Yeungling(very small selection).  Only tap they had was Miller Lite.    I can't say I'll be back at this point.  Sucks."}
