{"text":"Great little vegan cafe in the front a huge gym. Pleased."}
{"text":"Best vegan food ever!  Prices are EXTREMELY reasonable!  We're so lucky their in CLE; we travel all over the country and their menu and pricing and lets face it, TASTE far exceeds those of many other vegan restaurants.  Try their reuben sandwich, it's truly the best!"}
{"text":"Too overpriced to have terrible customer service. I went in, earlier this week, on my lunch break to get a vegan corned beef sandwich ( $10). After I placed my order, two people who were together placed their order for the same sandwich. I had been waiting 15 minutes before the cashier who took my order announced that the people who ordered the EXACT SAME sandwich as I did--who were BEHIND me--could get their order as it was ready. I then go up to the counter to ask the status of my order. The lady who was making the orders advised me that my order had JUST been placed on the belt. So I explained to her that I was on my lunch break and I needed to get back to work. I also explained that I ordered before the people who just received their food and I had the exact same sandwich! She then tells me that my food will be up shortly and that it's taking so long because they make the food to order. I demanded a refund, because at that point, I knew she was lying. It's not like she actually had to cook anything and if the people behind me had the exact same sandwich as I did, I should have received mine first. So, it was clear that the restaurant gives preference to either: people who dine-in or people who tip. A food service worker isn't entitled to a tip just because they rang out an order. I refuse to spend my money at an establishment that treats the patrons as if their money and time isn't valued! Besides, there are too many CHEAPER and HEALTHIER vegan friendly restaurants downtown Cleveland who treat all of their customers equally. *To add insult to injury, someone either of the company or works for the company responded to my review with this response: Clearly we have good customer service because the ratings say so. And by the way, we make mistakes, but next time tell us instead of writing a review. How insulting! Hello REBOL, DYNOMITE BURGERS, MELT, ANNA IN THE RAW, BOMBAY CHAAT and TAZA, just to name a few vegan options with better customer service. SMH."}
{"text":"Finally, a place with raw, vegan, whole food in downtown Cleveland. The kale salad with avocado, blueberries and pepitas was everything I want a kale salad to be: hearty, creamy, zesty, satisfying. Thank you Helio Terra!!"}
{"text":"First vegan restaurant I have been to & I enjoyed the experience. I tried the lentil soup, black bean burger & the roasted sweet potatoes, they were all delicious. Although I am interested in trying other vegan restaurants, I will definitely revisit as well as refer to others."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegan, but I do try to work a vegetable day in once a week. So finding interesting vegetable alternatives for lunch is important to me. I tried Helio Terra for lunch today and loved it.  Fresh juices and tasty entrees. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places to get vegan food in the city.  They have a nice mixture of healthy raw options, healthy cooked options, & not so healthy (but still delicious) vegan sandwiches.  The raw sweet potato sandwich is one of my favorite foods in Cleveland.  The cashew cheese is one of the best I've had.  For cooked options, there is a creamy brown rice pasta dish, a reuben, & a creative take on grilled cheese.  The owner/ staff are very nice and it seems like they are always trying to improve & add new dishes."}
{"text":"This is a little late...we stopped in here on Monday after driving for a couple of hours & visiting the Cleveland clinic, we were starving! I was excited and nervous to try this place. Excited because it was something new, and nervous because I didn't think it would be possible for there to be SO MANY OPTIONS!!! Everything we ordered was delicious!!! I could eat there every single day...even if I weren't eliminating all animal products from my diet !!! The pizza was amazing, and still good the next day reheated. I really can't say enough good things about this place. The girl working up front was extremely friendly and helpful, answering all of our questions and making recommendations. And the cook was also very friendly, and really thoughtful. Please visit and support this little slice of heaven! They even have a selection of smoothies & LATTES!!!!  Even if you aren't vegan or eating a strictly plant based diet, do something good for your body and your taste buds, and give it a try!!!"}
{"text":"I visited with the wife on 10/5/16. We absolutely love this place  the acknowledgement of customers walking in and saying hello was just as outstanding as the food. Wife ordered Raw Vegan potato burger and I ordered the cooked Reuben. The portions were nice and the prices were way cheap in my opinion. Two people eating healthy for $18.00 bucks.... I'm cool with that. :)  I ordered two additional Reuben's to go. This Cafe is 5 stars all the way! Cleveland Ohio has a gem. I look forward to enjoying there Cafe on my vacation next week."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME. If you're a vegan or not -- they have a delicious variety of smoothies, juices and amazing raw AND cooked meals.  I love the Lean Green smoothie and the Raw Zucchini Noodles with pesto sauce.   The fig jam they put on the grilled cheese sandwich is amazing.  Owners are lovely people who care about making their customers happy and take pride in good tasting vegan food.  The Kale Berry Salad and the Rotini Bake are also heavenly.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Just tried multiple items from the cafe and we were impressed! My favorite was the rotini bake and my sister loved the grilled cheese! Can't wait to come back to try more."}
{"text":"Helio Terra is the best vegan restaurant in Cleveland.  It is the first restaurant I visit when I come to Town. The beetnik juice is refreshing and is a must have after a long flight.  I have tried almost everything on the menu including most of the raw and cooked items and the food is consistently tasty and fresh.  The Ruben sandwich is incredible and I could eat it every day. The rotini bake is also a favorite from the cooked menu.  The kale berry salad is my favorite from the raw menu and the avocado toast is to die for! The owners Austin and Valencia take great care of their customers and run a fantastic business!"}
{"text":"Great service, good vegan food. These guys have an in-depth knowledge of vegetarianism and what it means to be vegan. They balance eating healthy with delicious recipes. Can't wait to eat here again when I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Ordered the lean green and avocado toast. The lean green tasted mostly of unripe banana and orange juice would not recommend. The avacado toast is one piece of bread but was tasty with the seasoning they put on it. Others around look pretty happy though."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food. Service was great too. 
I ordered the zucchini noodles and dip with veggies as well as tried out several of the juices. 
No complaints at all in fact loved it so much i ate there twice in one week. 
Great place if you are health conscious but want tasty food too."}
{"text":"Decided to go out on a limb and walk to this place on my lunch break. It was well worth the walk. Friendly staff, great prices and amazing food! Definitely will be back for more."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. One of the few places I can go out to eat. Being a raw foodie, there Raw menu is perfect for me. I especially enjoy the Tuscan flatbread (no salt in this dish) and Sweet Potato Sage Burger (no salt in this either if you get the cashew cream sauce on the side) all on dehydrated homemade raw bread and wonderful burger. Making me hungry thinking about it! Also they offer Reverse Osmosis water (the cleanest water) and fruit smoothies and macaroons! Austin and Valencia are sweethearts and I could eat here everyday"}
{"text":"This place is a gem. Deserves your support, for everything it's doing in the face of this temporarily fast-\"food\" world we currently live in. This is literally the restaurant paradigm of the future, where we value true quality and nutrition over junk and poison.

Their stuff speaks for itself. I mean, wow.
Utterly phenomenal smoothies. Their wraps are *incredible*, and all well priced. There's so much more to say but instead, I recommend experiencing it for yourself."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery to my hotel not far from this little vegan cafe. It took them an hour to arrive but the food was well packaged and tasty. So I'll forgive the wait.

The black bean burger is delicious. Served on sliced bread rather than a bun. And a generous helping of fresh avocado makes it a winner.

Vegan grilled cheese was super tasty. I liked the addition of sliced tomatoes inside and the surprisingly sweet \"cheese\" which may have been made of cashews? I couldn't put it down, even though the idea of a semi-sweet grilled cheese is odd.

I ordered a shot of ginger. Fighting a cold and felt like this would help. O. M. G. If you've never had a shot of pure ginger, prepare yourself. It is FIRE. A roller coaster ride for the senses, and probably ideal for someone who can handle the \"heat\" of hot sauces or wasabi. Enjoy the ride!

Overall I enjoyed my food. Loved that I could order delivery within the Yelp app and have it show up to my hotel room. It was healthy and delicious. Would order again!"}
{"text":"Basically the only vegan option in Cleveland I could find while visiting. It is inside a gym so kind of a weird vibe. The food was okay, nothing super special. I got the black bean sandwich and a chocolate shake. The shake was great. Sandwich could use a side salad or chips"}
{"text":"I went here a few times while I was in town for the RNC. The Reuben was excellent, one of the best vegan Reubens I've ever had. The sweet potato sage burger was also good - I'm not sure if I just don't like zucchini bread or if it's Helio Terra's zucchini bread I don't like, but it certainly took away from my meal. This was especially true when I had the flatbread, which I couldn't even finish. The smoothies were great (I had the lean green and the breakfast) but pricy - fortunately my meals were on the company dime, but I don't know that I would otherwise frequent this place. I sure was glad to have it right by the Q though. Not a lot of vegan/republican crossover I don't think."}
{"text":"Picked up order... 

The place is super busy preparing for Veg Fest, so I'm super excited that I was able to get in.

I ordered the Chocolate Power Smoothie. It was delicious but about half of the size I expected for a $9 item (even with the quality ingredients inside). Also, I'm 100% positive that this item was not 16oz (as written in the menu). I'm guessing that it was more like 12oz.

I also ordered the Cashew Cheese Wrap. It is phenomenal in taste and beauitful to see. You can clearly see every ingredient - Spinach, red pepper, avocado, mushroom, radish, sprouted mung bean and cashew cheese dip in collard green wrap"}
{"text":"I got to Cleveland early for my conference and was able to make a stop for lunch. This place was a bit of a trek from the conference center, but it was well worth the walk! It was also a plus that they offered WiFi.

Unfortunately, this was a Tuesday after a long weekend, and a few items on the menu weren't available because many of their ingredients are very perishable and they hadn't had a chance to restock. I settled on the lean green smoothie, the awesome grilled cheese, and the creamy rotini bake. (The latter two could really be lunches for two different people, but I couldn't resist over-ordering on purpose.) You really can't tell this is vegan food, and they have some unique offerings. I especially loved the fig jam in the grilled cheese that added a tang of sweetness to the sandwich. I also found the pricing to be super fair, considering the natural ingredients.

The reason I'm docking a star is that this cafe really needs more than one person working, especially around the lunch rush. The poor employee was literally taking orders and then running around the kitchen trying to make the food at the same time. I wanted a takeout box, and it took me a long time to get her attention. There was another customer who came in, waited for 10 min without being acknowledged, and walked out.

Other than the understaffing issues, this place was such a treat. I'll definitely be back if I'm ever in the area again!"}
{"text":"When I made plans to have dinner before a show with friends, I wasn't aware of the setup. It's basically the lobby of the gym. For me it's great for a pre/post bite, carry out, or a quick lunch - not so much for dinner with friends before a show. 

They need more printed menus! It was a busy evening when I met two friends, but still, I think they can seat around 20 people give or take, and they had maybe 5 printed menus. 

I ordered a juice and asked for light ginger. Unfortunately, it was still too much for me. My friends wife, a proclaimed ginger lover, also felt it was too strong to drink. However, she enjoyed her dinner, the Rueben. My friend had the chili and avocado toast and thought it was good. I enjoyed the black bean burger. 

I was hoping to try their truffles, but the only desserts they had available were packaged cookies. A little disappointing. 

Overall, the food is ok, the staff were nice, and it's great to have the vegan options!"}
{"text":"My first try here and I was not disappointed! I ordered lunch last week and tried the rueben and the harissa hummus with hot sauce.  So delicious.  I loved both and can't wait to try more of the incredible looking menu!"}
{"text":"Such an incredible local business! Not only is the food delicious, but the staff and service is outstanding! Their menu is packed with unique flavor combinations and is creative and enjoyable no matter what your diet consists of. The decor is bright and fun and the counter style service makes it a convenient experience all around. Would highly recommended this adorable spot!"}
{"text":"Tasty vegan food. The Reuben hit the spot. The cafe could use some design help. But the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"I came here in search of a good vegan/vegetarian restaurant, but I was underwhelmed by this place.

I ordered the Grilled cheese and the Zinger juice (carrot, apple, lemon, ginger). The grilled cheese had some really interesting sounding ingredients: caramelized onion, fig preserves, and truffle salt. It was tasty, but overpriced: $7! For that price I would have liked to see something else like a small side salad served with it. The juice was good, but the ginger was overpowering. I love ginger, but I think this juice needs to be balanced more by the other ingredients.

The other thing is the decor. This restaurant shares an entrance with Titans gym. It would be nice if there was more of a barrier separating the restaurant from the gym.

Overall, it was an ok (and pricey! $15!) meal. I don't think I would go out of my way to go back."}
{"text":"Had lunch here after the CIFF (Cleveland International Film Festival).  I have to say, the selection is amazing.  While the food was above average or perhaps a little better, I'd return here in a heartbeat to try another dish.  The hummus was delish.  The \"reuben\" was not to my liking, but I guess I had real corned beef on my mind.  Oh, how I miss eating meat...
Anyway, the gym smell walking in the door was a little bit of a turn off, but I'm glad we stayed to eat.  Excellent selection of juices and smoothies, too.  I'll try this place again to see if I can justify 5 stars...!"}
{"text":"These guys are amazing. Food is yummy and delicious. Plus the customer service is great. They even gave my kids a free drink bc we were driving on a long road trip. So nice!"}
{"text":"Wow, just had dinner here and this place is great. Awesome menu, great food, wonderful crew, especially, Austin the owner. He is so knowledgeable and is great to share a conversation with. Highly recommend if you are looking for a mellow delicious meal!"}
{"text":"I had a lot of questions and they were patient and helpful. 
Clean and cute place located downtown."}
{"text":"-Cashew cheese dip is the bomb and I could eat it with a spoon
-I wasn't a fan of the zuchinni noodle dish- it was an odd tasting combo with a weird texture to me, but maybe I am just not meant to eat vegan food! The cold/ hot mixture actually grossed me out.
-Really nice owner & service
-Next time I go, I will stick the cashew dip and avocado toast!"}
{"text":"Love having this place in the city! Quality food all around. Staff is friendly and food comes out pretty quick!"}
{"text":"This place is ok. It's attached a gym and is more of a smoothie place than a restaurant. We had the black bean burger and the rueban, both were ok.  Save your money, go deeper in the city... this place is just ok.  Shrugs."}
{"text":"I've been adding more plant based meals to my diet. Thought I'd give them a try and I'm happy I did. The Vegan Rueben is amazing. Perfect portion size and full of flavor. The Lean Green smoothie is also very good. Can't wait to try more items from the menu. As far as the location, it's great. Next to a gym, clean, and the staff is nice. Very helpful with recommendations on what to try."}
{"text":"Got the grilled cheese and chili, Both were good.  First time ever eating at a Vegan cafe, atmosphere; Cafe like, nothing fancy, great place for lunch.

Not 5/5, thought food was pricey, I am not a vegan, so I do not know price differences, but $7 for a small grilled cheese seems steep.  

Still, not a bad place."}
{"text":"Soooo in love with this vegan cafe. Eat there a few times a week and it always hits the spot! Love the cashew cheese wrap and the new grilled cheese is the bomb. Make sure to always try the daily specials and the baked good. Great spot in downtown CLE."}
{"text":"ALL VEGAN. Next to Titan gym, in the downtown area and open until 10pm which is convenient. Has Wifi.

Friendly and chill staff. Quite a bit of selection to choose from including juices and smoothies, soups, sandwiches, flatbread, and entrees.

1. Zucchini noodles with cashew Alfredo sauce ($8): Raw dish which is tasty and fresh. Good amount of flavor from the sauce but the sauce is a bit runny since it does not involve any cream. Good bowl size portion.

2. Roti bake ($8): Cooked dish. Initial bite reminded me of a curry sauce. It looks like it too. I liked this one because it was a warm dish and had more flavor from the sauce and peas.

Overall, great little cafe to grab healthy VEGAN food for lunch or dinner for a decent price."}
{"text":"Wow, what can I say?  I'm not a vegan and I am not typically a fan of rye, pickles, or mustard -- but the Ruben sandwich was delicious!

My girlfriend and I stopped in here around dinnertime on a Saturday and found an entirely empty cafe... Friendly staff and simple but colorful decor... and as I mentioned above, the Reuben was great.  Not overpowering but very tasty.

I will be back and I would highly recommend Helio Terra to anyone looking for casual dining options in downtown Cleveland."}
{"text":"Love this place.  If you are vegan, you can order ANYTHING on the menu.  The service is fast.  To-go orders are packed carefully.  Great location to people-watch from their window seats.  They now have Sunday hours, which is awesome!"}
{"text":"Gotta love a place that has vegetarian/vegan food that is akin to comfort food.  When I'm here, I always have plenty of choices and then I have to get the Key lime pie dessert.  This last time I was here, I had a delicious gluten free coconut macaroon.. The awesome grilled cheese is beyond belief

Definitely try this place no matter your meat eating ways.  It's delicious!"}
{"text":"I was in town for a long work weekend and ordered from this place three times via UberEATS.  The avocado toast is amazing. I loved the raw sunflower almond pate wrap and the black bean burger is very filling.  For breakfast I loved the overnight oats and will try to replicate their pumpkin spice latte at home.  Please open a location in Washington D.C., you would make a killing!"}
{"text":"I ordered the cashew cheese wrap which was $10. It was SUPER salty. I usually don't leave reviews on new restaurants that I try but this one just got on my nerve. I'm vegan so I wanted to try this place out. First, the cashier/cook/server (yes, there was only 1 guy working there when I went) had an attitude when I asked for a straw for my water (probably because it's too much plastic for the environment) 

Second, me and 2 of my friends waited 25 mins for our food to come 

Lastly, like I said my food was absolutely salty. It was to the point where I couldn't even eat more than 3 bites of it. Absolutely disgusting."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery, so I cannot comment on the restaurant venue or the service.

Cleveland is low on vegan restaurants, so Helio Terra is an assett to the local culinary scene.  I tried:

The cashew cheese dip - has a thick-hummus like texture, but it tastes delicious.  It could easily double as a spread due to the thickness.  It doesn't quite pass as a non-vegan cheese dip, as the flavor is both nut-like and cheese-like.  However, I found it as delicious as any non-vegan cheese dip/spread.

The sweet potato burger - I was a little disappointed in the patty.  It was not as sweet as I had hoped and I could not quite place the flavor.  The flatbread, spread, and sprouts that accompany the patty were delightful and would make a great sandwich on their own.

Creamy zucchini pasta - Definitely a healthy and dairy free alternative to alfredo pasta.  Don't expect the zucchini to have the texture of pasta, because...it's not pasta.  But if you are looking to satisfy a craving, this dish will do the trick.

I also appreciated the good packing of the food for delivery."}
{"text":"I'm always happy to see all vegan eateries, so we made sure we came for lunch on a trip from Columbus. We just had to take one lap to find parking, not a bad situation. 
Went in and ordered a Rueben and a sweet potato burger and a side to go. Both were great! 
The list of smoothies looked awesome, I'll try that next time. 
Service was pretty quick, I was about third in the line of orders. They were really nice, and offered me a glass of water while I waited 
I'll go back."}
{"text":"Ordered today from UberEATS and it was amazing!! Got the vegan Rueben and it was so good I ordered extra for the weekend!! The flavor was spot on, it all worked beautifully together. HIGHLY recommended!!!"}
{"text":"I was stoked to get some solid veg food while in Cleveland, but unfortunately this place was just meh."}
{"text":"Super nice staff and really fantastic food. I had the Ruben and my partner got the raw almond wrap. The staff was super chill and helpful especially for being inside a gym."}
{"text":"Got some vegan ruben sandwiches to go for dinner. They make a very respectable Ruben. The vegan Ruben is like the holy grail of vegan cuisine. Many restaurants try but few succeed in making a vegan Ruben. Helio comes pretty damn close. Its worth trying. I would eat here again. Counter service, friendly staff. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. They have a menu of cold and hot food. I have the vegan Ruben and it was amazing! This place could definitely be its own restaurant; it is currently attached to the gym. Still amazing though!"}
{"text":"The food is good, the juice is fresh, the customer service could've been better, and the location is either extremely convenient or extremely inconvenient, depending on where you are. If you live downtown and work out at this gym or work in the area or happen to be here already, this place is so worth it to grab a bite to eat. However, I wouldn't recommend traveling out of your way to get here. There's street parking and you're near the casino, and upon realizing it's a small cafe in the corner of a gym, you almost feel disappointed that you came all this way and circled the block to find a parking spot."}
{"text":"Tucked away in a gym is this great little vegan spot.  Prices are reasonable and the black bean burgers is my favorite."}
{"text":"The Sweet Potato Sage Burger was bursting with nutrition. All of the ingredients were perfect proportionate and the cashew cream cheese is absolutely to die for!!! I would highly recommend this burger! It is beautiful, satisfying and filling. Perfection! A+++"}
{"text":"Oh, how I wish there was a business like this attached to the gym I go to. 

This is a very casual all vegan eatery housed within a gym. That sounds more awkward that it actually is. We noticed the hum of a treadmill while we were eating but it wasn't distracting. 

We stopped in on a Saturday afternoon and were the only patrons. We had a nice chat with the owner (I think), who told us about how the restaurant is new and evolving and they're constantly trying to make it better. We sat on some bar stools and enjoyed people watching out the window but there are regular tables to sit at, too. 

The menu is broken down into raw and cooked items along with juices and smoothies. It's nearly impossible to find a vegan Reuben in this town, so I was super jazzed to find one on their menu. I ordered a green juice and a Reuben and my fiance ordered a chocolate smoothie with a grilled cheese sandwich made with fig jam. Both sandwiches were very solid. There were a lot of other items on the menu that sounded interesting that I'd like to try (raw burger, raw pizza, zucchini noodles, pasta bake, and so many other things)

If you're into vegan food or would like to give vegan food a try, this is a great place to check out."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have been searching for vegan places in the Cleveland area and we're referred to Helio Terra pretty instantly by some friends of ours. The results are...mixed. 

The location is quite cool, basically next to a gym. Can safely say I have never seen that before, but definitely seems convenient. The staff had a really positive attitude and we're very helpful in answering our questions, which is a big plus. 

The food was alright. Not bad at all, but not blown away. I had the sweet potato sage \"burger\" which sounded incredible but ended up being just 'ok'. A little on the mushy side. Girlfriend had the vegan reuben which was much better. The meal was just one sandwich which is fine but...

...not for the price. Many other reviewers said the same thing and I agree - it isn't worth the price. A salad of some kind, fruit, anything on the side would make this a little more palatable. I'd like to come back here and try again, but I won't go out of my way to."}
{"text":"Helio Terra gets major points for being the only vegan café in downtown Cleveland and manages to make up for let's call it, deliberately paced service and a strange design by providing some majorly delicious, healthy, ethical eats. Everything is meticulously made to order so, let's be clear: this is not the place to go if you're in any way in a hurry, but the staff are generous and funny and strike up conversation to pass the time. In addition, it is worth mentioning that HT is unusual in that it is attached to a gym with no real barriers to speak of, so you can watch people running on the treadmill while you enjoy your soup or smoothie! The food, as I've mentioned, is great. Folks a little afraid of a full vegan meal shan't despair--while there are interesting ingredients at play (wheatgrass, seitan, cashew cheese), they are formed into delicate, enriching amalgams. The grilled 'cheese' is extraordinary and almost better than the real thing. And yes, yes, you will leave feeling full! Guaranteed."}
{"text":"Casual cafe full of delicious, clean vegan eats. Nice selection, many choices. I had their black bean & quinoa burger with dayia cheese and avocado and LOVED it. Appears to be made with TLC! Will go back for sure."}
{"text":"I'm glad to have Helio Terra in my work neighborhood. I keep coming back for the salads, juices, and smoothies, and I've grown fond of the raw zucchini \"noodles.\" I'd like to see more seasoning, though, and they have an opportunity to shorten the wait time for takeout."}
{"text":"Wow this place is so refreshing a good break from your everyday lunch spots. The juices are amazing the chef has a really good mind for creating amazing vegan dishes. I will come back ASAP, also heard they deliver on grub hub which makes it super convenient since I work about 2 miles away! Check it out, run don't walk!"}
{"text":"This is the best vegan place in Cleveland! The zucchini pasta is AMAZING."}
{"text":"Holy zucchini noodles!!! That's usually my go to dish when given the chance to eat vegan/raw, so I consider myself to be a zucchini noodle connoisseur. This dish was hands down one of the best zucchini noodle dishes I've ever had. What really got me was that it was served WARM!! Yumz in my tumz. The cashew alfredo and walnut crumble were also super tasty. I definitely want to come back and try other things on the menu but it will be hard not to order this dish every single time!!! Also had a berry smoothie which was really yummy!

The people working there were super friendly but not annoying friendly (it's a fine line!!)."}
{"text":"This is by far the best vegan restaurant in the downtown Cleveland Ohio area the service was excellent and the food was even better I can't wait until the next time I get to experience this wonderful restaurant five stars sweet deals great food the atmosphere is amazing"}
{"text":"This place and people are exquisite.  I have tried multiple dishes and every one has been on point.  The ingredients are insanely fresh and of the highest quality.  The staff is so great and knowledgeable.  The grilled cheese is one of my favorites, made with fig butter and agave...yum!  I will be eating here many many more times.  Also, I hardly ever find it necessary to write yelp reviews but this place is top notch."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite hidden gems in Cleveland, which I go to at least once every other week. Whether I want a snack or something more filling, I know I can always go here. Located near Barrio and East 4th Street, street and garage parking are available. 

I was ecstatic when I found out different services, such as Yelp or UberEats, will now deliver their food, CHA-CHING! I use this very often if I do not have time to travel to their store.

I am a huge fan of the chocolate power smoothie, personally, this is the best in the city. Why? Not only the flavor, but the amount they make for your smoothie. 

The workers are lovely and educational on all of the options they have on their menu, which makes me feel comfortable when I try to order because I am not a vegan. 

Take the time out of your day to stop in and order something tasty, I promise, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went on a late late afternoon with my mom because I was excited to finally try out this place. The guy at the register greeted us right away and offered up menus to look over and pointed out that there were some specials on the wall. We decided that we get a couple things so that we could share and try more than one thing on the menu. We ordered the Kale Berry Salad and Sunflower Almond Pate wrap. We went and sat at a high top table as we were the only ones there. I was very hungry by the time we grabbed a table and we waited anxiously to try out our delicious vegan food. A group of three came in after us and ordered and sat down a table next to us. Their order came up and then our waiting began...
I could see that they were getting phone orders also, however we ended up waiting 45 minutes before our food came out plus the people that can in before us got their food right away! The super hipster guy at the counter became increasingly less friendly. The food was just OK, kind of blah. I have been eating Vegan for a long time now and I appreciate simple meals but everything we had was lacking in flavor. Had we not been ready to eat a shoe at that point I would not have bothered to finish my food. Needless to say I do not see myself ever going back. Disappointed for sure."}
{"text":"David, who was working the front counter was very unprofessional, unhelpful, rude and just strait up had terrible energy. His co-worker Indigo was not much better. I only gave this establishment two stars because the veggie burger was ok. In my opinion, the owner should fire both of these employees!"}
{"text":"First off I am not vegan. But with this place, you'll easily learn that vegan food is NOT boring. I was so wrong for so long til Helio Terra schooled my on my taste buds. Also the chocolate power smoothie....banger!"}
{"text":"Austin and Valencia have done vegan proud with this awesome fresh food eatery. The hardest thing for me when I visit is what to choose. There really are no bad choices here. So here's the Cashew Cheese Wrap. And yes, it was delicious!"}
{"text":"First class vegan restaurant. I had a berry smoothie that was top notch and a sweet potato sage burger that was one of the best veggie burgers I've ever had. I also had the reuben which was next level. They're quick and talented. Love this establishment!"}
