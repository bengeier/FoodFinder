{"text":"We decided on this restaurant for our last meal on our road trip to Montreal. Food was awesome! Portions were great and service was amazing. The waitress was nice enough to translate and explain every single item on the menu for us in English. Pad thai was very tasty, not overly sour like some places. Pad sew was amazing too, not drenched in soy sauce like usual. The mango salad was my favourite, very fresh and light. My kids loved the fried rice, very flavourful. We also made two orders of the satay chicken skewers, the chicken was juicy and flavourful, not dry. Price was very fair. 
Will definitely come back here when we're in town again."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Honestly some of the best Thai in all of Montreal. Location a little isolated but worth the travel. And not $$$ either. Had the Pad Thai and Crispy Chicken with entree of dumplings... well done! A+"}
{"text":"On adore ce petit restaurant sans pretention.  Le service est attentionné et amical et la nourriture est savoureuse et authentique."}
{"text":"Good, clean, and friendly. Priced right and the food (Papaya Salad and a fat noodle chicken something) was spiced perfectly."}
{"text":"Delicious! Waitress was really lovely and the food was amazing! Small place, but worth going to if you are after fresh, yummy Thai food. Price was also very reasonable for the size of the meals. Would definitely recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Cute resto food and friendly service. Not too many restos in the area, so this one is a nice change. We had the pad Thai and red curry chicken. Portions were good and the food hit the spot. They have a small terasse in the summer so you can enjoy your meal outside too."}
{"text":"S'il y a un bon endroit où manger dans cette partie de Rosemont, une nuit à Bangkok est définitivement la meilleur. Jamais je n'ai gouté du thai aussi frais et savoureux"}
{"text":"Je demeure tout près, à peine 10 minutes à pieds et depuis son ouverture il y a un an et demi, jamais je n'avais été. Et bien surprise surprise !!! Tonight was the night!
Un seul mot à dire MALADE!
J'en reviens pas comment j'ai pu  passer devant cet endroit sans jamais y mettre le pied! Je suis plutôt type resto français mais j'avais une rage de pad thaï et franchement ... Celui végétarien était vraiment délicieux, sauce onctueuse qui enrobe parfaitement chaque nouille et garnie de légumes frais. L'entrée de poulet croustillant est vraiment top!
Poulet tendre à souhait et panure croustillante et légère. Dumpling à la sauce arachide avec basilic thaï, tapis de legumes en juliennes mélangé à cette sauce de luxe crémeuse et pas trop sucrée. La salade de mangue avec soupçon de piquant, craquante, surette et sucrée, garnie de cacahuète, basilic thaï arosé d'une petite sauce sucrée miammmmmmm.

Mon chum est un mangeur de steak et il m'a dit: Baby! Tu dois ajouter ce resto à notre liste de favoris !!!

Bravo et j'allais oublier...

Service 5 étoiles!!

Merci pour la belle soirée"}
{"text":"Très belle découverte à deux pas de chez moi! Beau petit restaurant avec belle ambiance qui pourrait être un peux plus tamisée. Pad tai délicieux! Prix raisonnable."}
{"text":"It is a good surprise! Never expect some Asian food is such quality in Montreal - especially in a sub-bur area.

Ordered a curry with chicken... Inside the curry there are generous amount of mushroom, broccoli, bell pepper, lettuce... The chicken pieces are soft and tasty. I asked them to make it a little spicy and the favour is just right.

It is a little store in the middle of nowhere."}
{"text":"Plenty of vegetarian options and the spice level was right where we wanted it. Had the curry and pad Thai, both were great. Also recommend the local IPA."}
{"text":"Ils m'enlèvent les mots de la bouche. Plats exquis, bon service et rapide, prix abordables!! Resto sans prétention, je me suis cru à bangkok pour la soirée"}
{"text":"It's fun to venture out of the trendy areas of Montreal and discover hidden gems that lie off the beaten path.  Case in point was tonight with Une Nuit à Bangkok which is located in Rosemont.  There really is nothing in this particular area of the borough so this restaurant is a great find and much appreciated.  It sits on Bellechasse which is mostly residential save for the odd business here and there.

The restaurant is owned by the people who bring you the Tuk Tuk food truck.  The owner serves and handles customers while the chef cooks up the food in the back.  It is very small inside so I would recommend a reservation because it is quite popular.  The restaurant is quite casual and of course being a Thai place you can expect some Thai-inspired decor.  

We started with spring rolls and dumplings which admittedly aren't the most Thai dishes around but I have a major weakness for dumplings in peanut sauce.  Both were pretty solid.  The peanut sauce clearly had a spice in it to give it extra flavour.  I can't put my finger on what it was but I did enjoy it.  That was followed by a shrimp pad thai for me.  The dish was well seasoned and they got the spicy levels just right.  It was spicy enough to have a little zing to it but not so much that I was breathing fire.

Prices are very reasonable.  Dinner for two came out to about $50 after tax which isn't bad at all considering we ordered appetizers, mains and beer.  They also do takeout so if you live nearby you can come here to pick up some food for lunch or dinner.

I am already thinking about how soon I can come back here to try something else on the menu.  It is great to see a place like this in a part of the neighbourhood where dining options are few and far between.  Definitely give this place a try when you get a chance!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this restaurant. Food is average at best and lacks the complexity and balance of flavours one finds in Thai food. Menu is also limited to noodles and rices dishes, with only one type of dessert. For what we ordered it was also way too expensive.  The waitstaff were friendly, however. I would say that Pamika Brasserie Thai is a far better choice than this place."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, fantastic service and very reasonably priced. Thank you so much for a lovely dinner !"}
