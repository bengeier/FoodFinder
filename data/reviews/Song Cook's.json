{"text":"This was our first time dining in and we loved everything. The service was great, very fast and servers are very nice and advised us what's most popular on a menu when asked.
We had fried dumplings, pork bone kimchee soup and teriyaki beef. Everything was very fresh and with lots of flavor.
We'll be back. thanks a lot, guys!"}
{"text":"Good menu of Korean food. Hard to find as the sign over the restaurant read 'Soft Tofu'. Well, it makes (some) sense (if I squint) given that part of the menu focuses on soft tofu stews. No, not in the sense of Irish stew. This is very Korean and very spicy. As far as the stews go, they were better than average in flavor. The traditional spicy seafood stew with soft tofu was tasty and had a lot of Korean green chili peppers. You'll want to ask for less of them or none altogether if you don't like the heat. Also had more seafood in it than you expect at other spots. Typically you'd be able to order special rice in a stone pot. Unfortunately, today they were off their game and we could not order it. Sort of disappointing if you are used to the pairing. They also did not serve the stew as hot (in temperature) as I am accustomed to and no egg was served table side to crack into the stew. This definitely takes the edge of the spiciness and adds more of a creamy texture. Oh well, as I said I think they were off their game. We also ordered Korean Kalbi or short ribs. Normally quite tasty with garlicy sweet flavor, ours was bland and fatty. 

I really wanted to love this place. The menu looked great, the atmosphere seemed nice and I was really hungry. 

Overall, had potential but failed on execution. Won't be back because there are many other Korean restaurants who get it right."}
{"text":"This is a lunch spot favourite of mine. Actually let's be real, I would even drive here for dinner!

The lunch specials are AWESOME - $10 for a various entrees, plus 2 deep fried dumplings, side salad and a pop. what more can a girl ask for! I usually get the bibimbap or the black bean noodles. The only thing with the bibimbap lunch is that it's not in a stone bowl, so your rice doesn't get all crispy.

For dinner, whatever I order I will pay the extra $4 a bowl for the barley and beans rice. Sure I could probably buy a whole bag of rice and make it, but it's certainly not going to be as good. I usually get the pork bone soup for dinner.

All the sides are yummy and you can ask for refills. You know it's legit korean food when you see korean people eating there as well. 

Haven't tried the table top BBQ there yet but I will soon!

Hope this helps,

{"text":"Huge portion sizes and great flavours! A lovely find west of the city with quick and friendly service (our food came within 10mins!) and the kimchi and other complimentary apps were fresh really good quality. Highly recommended. Their JaJung Myuh noodles were a hit."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong.  Not the most spacious or modern place, but the food is outstanding and the prices are very fair.  We go regularly!"}
{"text":"For years, I've been wishing that another Korean buffet restaurant would open. I didn't think it would be realistic though given the one in K-Town on Bloor St. went out of business about a decade ago. Song Cook's is the next best thing. They offer half portions of various dishes so that customers can try a number of dishes. Half ja-jang myun with a half order of tang-soo-yuk, etc. It's genius!

And because the food is made fresh versus sitting under a heat lamp at buffet's, it's fresh.

The only reason this place isn't a 5 star is because the ban chan is very ordinary. They only provide the basic kimchi, gab-doo-ghee and dak-gwan."}
{"text":"* Menu: Detailed, varied with a wide range, and comes with helpful descriptions. 
* Food: Very tasty and was properly spiced
* Service: Fast, helpful, and patient enough to wait for me slogging through the vast menu
* Price: cheap. there are some good preset meals
* Ambience: awesome"}
{"text":"I come here almost every day after taekwondo class with some classmates.
The food is served in large portions and the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"I love this place. The best Korean spot in my opinion. The charm and attitude of the owners is beyond comparison.  From being excitedly yet politely greeted as soon as you walk in to having your order respectfully taken to even receiving a discount coupon for your next visit- I feel at ease.

Meat lovers- this porkbone soup is delicious. Also try  the grilled mackerel as an appetizer.

Way more personal than owl of Minera in mississauga. And a far better ambiance than Wow at hurontario/ dundas. Although if you like the Kim chi pancake - owl is your spot, and potato pancake- wow is your spot. 

Check out all these places and Guage for yourself!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this restaurant for a while now and I have always had an amazing experience with them. We went the other night about 45 mins before closing and the staff was so friendly, the food came out so quick and tasted delicious and we were told not to rush because they were closing soon. They had multiple waiters coming to help us so we were never waiting around for more water/tea or looking to flag someone down. I absolutely love this place and the selection of great food, a must go if you love Korean cuisine!"}
{"text":"I was visiting Toronto and a friend recommended this authentic Korean restaurant. I had the Bim Bam Bam in a hot stone bowl a classic on every Korean menu. They skimped on the beef, but the rice was nice and crispy from the hot stone bowl. Veggies were great!

Service is fast and we had a great time. 

Tip: If you love overstock shopping, there is a Factory Direct store right next door in the same strip mall :)  Just don't buy computers or phones from there, most of them are junk/busted."}
{"text":"Had a craving for Korean food and  after seeing such rave reviews on Yelp, decided to give it a try. From the outside the place looks quite small, but as soon as you enter it, it's quite a specious and cozy restaurant. We ordered short ribs,  bibimbap (w/ beef fried egg, vegetables) and my friend had spicy pork bone soup. The food was pretty good but not amazing. The short ribs were quite fatty and did not have too much lean meat. My order of bibimbap was tasty but the dish really could have used a bit more meat. Also, the pork bone soup was all bones and barely had any meat. The special rice with buckwheat is a nice addition to the menu for those that prefer a healthier option. Overall, it was okay but I was definitely expecting more."}
{"text":"I came here after seeing the many great Yelp reviews, since I was heavily craving Korean food, but left adequately satisfied.  Like many others have mentioned, the storefront is tiny, and the small sign didn't help me find the restaurant in any way.  Stepping in was a whole different story, the store is much more spacious than it seems! The restaurant seemed modern, and pretty clean, so I was glad it wasn't as sketchy as it seemed from the outside.  

The food was where I was left a bit disappointed.  I ordered the LA Kalbi as it is my usual dish at Korean restaurants, but I felt the meat was a bit bland, and not seasoned well.  The bibimbap was alright.  However, the seafood soup didn't seem as fresh for some reason...  

Service was great as the servers were extremely pleasant."}
{"text":"Some of the best Korean food in Mississauga. The storefront looks small from outside but is quite large on the inside. Service is good and the food is exceptional."}
{"text":"We went on mother's day weekend. The restaurant was packed we waited about 30 minutes to be seated. the food over all to me was decent, but nothing spurised me that made me feel it was unique. Decor was nice."}
{"text":"This has taken first spot in my choice for Korean food in Mississauga.  First of all the lunch combos are great value.  Comes with 2 dumplings,  jyajamyuen,  my version had pork cutlet and a drink all for 10.99. 

Very nice place,  loved the service and the environment.  Great place to bring a group of friends.   

Also the quality of the sides are amazing."}
{"text":"The place was steady and mostly full on a cold Tuesday night. Almost all patrons were Korean, which usually means the food is authentic and tasty.
The food definitely didn't disappoint.  We had the bibimbap to share with our toddler and a pork and kimchi stew, which went down great on a chilly autumn evening.

Only concern is a price to portion size ratio.  We were used to getting 1.5 times as much Korean food for $8-10, so we didn't order enough, as we are not big eaters and two dishes to share between ourselves and our baby usually gets us stuffed. This time we got two dishes for $13-15 each and left  a bit on the hungry side.  Food was very tasty but not plentiful."}
{"text":"I've come here multiple times to eat in or take out. I usually find that the food is good (even if some dishes are a bit pricey), and the service is... not that good. 

Usually my table is just ignored, or it takes a while for us to get things we ask for, like a fork or water. However, I was there for dinner on my birthday recently. It was a big group of us and while we were waiting for our food to arrive, we asked our server to take a picture of our whole group. We didn't get a picture. No. We got \"No we're too busy\" and a walk away. Obviously we were not impressed. And not only that... once our food arrived, I had to go to their takeout desk if I ever wanted to speak to anyone. It almost seemed like they were avoiding our area. I even had to go there to pay for the meal because none of the servers paid any attention to us. After that experience, this place just isn't worth the trouble. I haven't been back since and I don't plan on going again.

On a side note, we didn't do anything to be on the server's bad side. I was with family for that dinner. I made a reservation, we were on time, and we ordered (even though it took a while for anyone to come see us) and ate patiently even when we were getting bad service. I still left a tip because I know how rough working in a restaurant is.. BUT customers should not be treated the way we were."}
{"text":"Decent food, reasonable price. Mississauga has some more expensive Korean places, but it's nice to see we don't have to go all the way to Toronto just for some Gam Ja Tang. Have been a few times."}
{"text":"Best Korean place out west! Very extensive menu with a lot of traditional korean food. I love their combos like Jajangmyun and Tangsuyuk or Gampunggi or their sets with Spicy Soon Dobu with dumplings served with steamed egg and Jaeyuk (spicy pork). The price is reasonable and food is tasty! I've had jajangmyun in a number of places in Yonge and Finch but this is the best so far! I think they l need a bigger space soon since it's always busy. Will keep coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"When I came here with a friend two weeks ago, the place was as booming as the first time I visited a few months ago. The wait staff are super friendly, and even though they were bustling about they do not forget what you asked for. It appeared that members of the staff were all on board and willing to go above and beyond even if their job did not particularly entail the task (grabbing tea for us when his main job was collecting plates). Overall great experience with on point food. Would definitely come again."}
{"text":"Like this place b/c of the combo meals. Side dishes are somewhat lacking (only kimchi? Really?) but they offer refills. I eat here occasionally because it's close and convenient.
Service is average but the layout of the restaurant makes it difficult for the waiters to take care of everyone.

Dishes:
As I said, combo meals are great. I like the jjajjungmyun and spicy seafood soup or the jjajjyung jyun with dumplings- the dumplings are very well done with thin crispy skin.
I've also had their dolsot bibimbap, which is average.
Their Dwen Jjang Chigae broth is excellent but it doesn't come with rice... which bothers me more than it should, but really?.
The Pork Bone Soup broth is clear and very good- tastes very homemade and warms you right up!

Come here for light, healthy food with reasonable portions :)"}
{"text":"This is a solid choice for Korean food in Mississauga. You can tell because its always packed and you'll see plenty of Korean patrons that frequent this place. 

Extensive menu with of varieties of Korean food in all types of combos. You can get soon tofu, noodles, stir fry, grilled meats - literally any typical Korean food you can think of, they have it. You can even get combos where they pair several dishes together. Unfortunately you only get kimchi as a side dish though. 

The biggest pro is that they offer different varieties of rice here, albeit an extra surcharge. Get the mixed grain rice if you're willing to pay the extra $2. I liked their jajangmyun and got the combo with their dumplings. My friend enjoyed her vegetarian bibimbop and Kalbi.
 
I do not recommend their soups (really spicy so ask for mild if your tolerance is low) or seafood pancake (it was mushy instead of crispy)."}
{"text":"Clutch Korean spot to deal with my cravings!  Their menu is quite large and could be overwhelming, but all the dishes I've tried so far are delish!  Even their little side dishes are awesome!  The restaurant itself is clean and spacious, and thoughtfully decorated.  I only wish their sign is flashier and has bigger font because you could drive right past it so easily without knowing there's a great restaurant inside!"}
{"text":"I've been to quite a number of Korean restaurants in the GTA and in Seoul, and I have to admit this is one of the best Korean restaurants in town. The food is awesome, the service is great, and the prices are decent. You're looking at around $10-15 a meal (unless you order one of the specials). If you are craving kbbq and not feeling like going to an all you can eat, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"After hearing good reviews about this place from my friends, I decided to finally check it out. I was not disappointed! This restaurant is a great place for Korean food! The atmosphere was nice with plenty of seating and the staff were friendly and attentive. 

I ordered the Spicy Pork Cutlet and it came with rice and side dishes such as kimchi, tofu, etc. The food was delicious, I enjoyed it very much! It was spicy and really flavorful because of the sauce added to the cutlet. My friend ordered the Pork Bone Soup and she said it was also very flavorful because of the pork and spices.   

Overall, I enjoyed eating here with my friends and I finally found a good Korean restaurant I can come back to whenever I want Korean food."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place, I think I'm visiting here just like once an every week. Clean and cozy interior lights stimulates appetite, and every dish contains no MSG, which makes no worries in terms of health as well, and of course, so delicious. Mouth-wash available washrooms are also a plus. Recommended!"}
{"text":"It's only thanks to all my fellow Yelpers that I was able to physically locate this place by identifying the red tofu sign outside. Thanks y'all!!

The inside is very spacious, and so we were seated quite comfortably. I got a beef tendon broth with brown rice, beans, and barley. It was so thick and heavenly, and tasted super delicious. The taste was subtle, but rich. The broth was perfect for this rainy day today (warmed up my soul). The rice was of a very interesting texture... It was extremely glutinous and very compact.

My mom ordered their lunch bentos with jajangmyun and bulgogi. My dad got one of their specials - a beef broth soup with clams, seaweed, and hand cut noodles. The portion was huge, and a great steal seeing that it was only $8! Definitely great value.

I loved the variety of banchan, and actually got seconds of them (cleaned them off almost instantly as they came). Am looking forward to coming again, but alas, it's a bit far from where I live."}
{"text":"So sad to see this place deteriorate. This used to be my go-to place for jajangmyun but the owner/chef must have changed because it doesn't taste the same as before. Flavours are bland, portions have shrunk, while prices have gone up. Last time I went, they didn't even have those daily specials anymore. I haven't tried the other menus so I can't say much for that but I still won't be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"best korean food i had in sauga so far. the flavor was pretty authentic and the selection is vast"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a weekday lunch. I ordered the porkbone soup and white rice ( no idea why you have to order separate) the soup was just okay I feel like it has been catered for people who haven't had Korean food before ( if you haven't you are missing out on something magical) but all in all I had a good experience here. To compare it to other Korean restaurants my list would be buk Chang dong soon tofu first then owl of Minerva maybe songs third"}
{"text":"Same trip as my other review...now this place is great...the main chef and owner come out to visit l, they REMEMBER you, especially on convective nights!

The food is more my style, for those of you who know how to to cook asian, a little sugar can go a long way when making foods...thus place is definitely looking more into the taste of food!

People are a lot warmer and more genuine!  Extra banchan on my second visit!

The food, in terms of flavor is more like my wides cooking!!!

I will be visiting more locations on my next business visit.."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent!! Great prices, great taste, large portions. Jajangmyun (black bean sauce on noodles) is soooo gooood. Highly recommended for Korean food!"}
{"text":"AS AUTHENTIC AND YUMMY AS IT GETS : )

This place is a personal favourite and gets a spot on my \"Restaurants to eat at again before I die\" (I may have exaggerated a bit but it's pretty damn good).

I've past by this place many times growing up in Mississauga but because the sign in the front is so small and not too eye catching, it's easy to miss. I just regret not going here sooner! My pals took me here one day and I fell in love with it. The interior is really warm and inviting and the servers welcome you right when you walk in. The menu has a great selection of popular dishes to choose from and at a reasonable price.

I always end up getting the Pork Bone Soup because it's just so darn amazing!
I especially like Song Cook's because they serve the soup with not just plain white rice, but with an aromatic red-bean mixed rice (and don't worry non bean-eaters you only taste a subtle hint of the bean) : ) There are other great meals on the menu as well such as Bibimbap, Jajangmeyon, Soondubu Chiggae...etc and also a selection from Japanese cuisine as well.

It's a really nice restaurant to visit and take your friends and family to. The service is great (not to mention the good looking waiters and waitresses ; p), servers are always polite and quick to respond, food comes out hot and fast, and yea there's really nothing bad I have to say about this restaurant.

Love Love Love Song Cook's : )"}
{"text":"Great place for Korean food.  Very nice atmosphere with plenty of seating and staff is friendly and prompt.  I had the soon tofu and bulgogi with multigrain rice.  Of course this came with a bunch of sides like kimchi."}
{"text":"Should be called \"Noodle Noodle Seafood soup\" rather then \"seafood noodle soup\". Ordered the top dinner for one and got 2 bowls of noodles, one in a paste and another in the soup. 95% of dish one were noodles with a paste which wasn't bad. Second dish was 90% noodle some small pieces of squid and soup which was not not good. If I wanted just wanted to have noodles I would go buy a package of pasta from Food Basics and boil it. 

I find the \"dinner\" combo to be very ridiculous. My girlfriend's chicken cutlets were pretty good."}
{"text":"Food is ok. But the customer service is one of the worst I have experienced at Korean Restaurants. We asked several times for a refill of the side dishes/water but never got anything. They have a service call button on the table. However, don't expect any waiter/waitress to give you any attention. My friend waved to a waiter. He saw him twice but chose to pretend he didn't see a customer is asking for something.

They only moved very fast when we asked for the bill."}
{"text":"I found out about this place through BLOG TO's article... and I must say I LOVE this place, the food is delicious, they serve it so fast and the services is amazing! People at this restaurant are so friendly! They have also started No-re-bang on Fridays and Sunday!!! 

I ordered:

Ja Jang Myun
Jab Chae
Khan Poung GI
Kalbi
Bulgogi 

Super Super and tasty!! You must must must go to this restaurant !!! 
I am definitely a returning customer!"}
{"text":"We came here looking for a dinner as we didn't have lunch since morning.  And there was a waitress who took our orders and even asked me what type of rice we wanted with our dishes. After waiting for 15mins, we finally called another waiter over to check our order. That was when we discovered our orders was not put through!  I was really upset that we were ignored the entire time, especially when we saw mother couple who came in after us and they got their food served right away. And when I asked them what happened. The waitress who was supposedly served us didn't even admit she took the order from us.  It was clearly her fault that she was the waitress working that day. I cannot accept the ignorance of their service."}
{"text":"The menu is extensive with a lot of different options.

Service was slow. We came here during lunch time. The restaurant was really busy and seemed short staffed as it took them a while to get us menus and to take our order. After that the food was brought out quickly, and the waiter was attentive.

We ordered the Tangsuk yok (sweet and sour pork), which I loved. It was battered lightly and fried nicely. As well as the Jaja myeong (black bean noodles) one of my favourite Korean dishes. 

We also tried dokbolgi. We ordered chap chae (rice noodles), which had way too many onions for me, as well budae jigae (stew hot pot with noodles, spam). All the dishes were tasty and delicious. 

Despite the slow service I'd be back for more food."}
{"text":"Don't let the outside look fool you. 
The place is huge.
The food is great at decent prices.
I was so busy eating I forgot to take pictures."}
{"text":"I Love Songs! Great selection, but I always stick to the same dishes - Jajamyun, Kalbi Jim, kalbi Tang, Tang Su Yuk, Bibimbap, Bokkeumbap being my faves. Ive come back time and time again, great authentic Korean food. I like that they have a ton of different rice options, I always stick to plain Jasmine rice, but its great for when Im trying to be heath concious."}
{"text":"I did a review for the North York location for this restaurant. They have the same quality and taste. Here's the review:

Great Korean food for the price. I've had almost everything on the menu. Nothing really stands out but everything is pretty good. Love the combo plates. My wife loves the stone bowl fish eggs and cold water buckwheat noodles (it comes with a slice of watermelon - crazy!!) The service is hit and miss but tolerable.

We're at the Mississauga location most of the time but recently went to the North York location, which feels like a much bigger space (could be the high ceilings). Great place to bring your non-Korean friends (or even your Korean friends) to show what Korean foods all about.

The restaurant is a little difficult to located. Hint - it's behind the Moores store."}
{"text":"Went there with some out of town guests.  They wanted some good Korean food and we've been to the song cooks in Thornhill so we thought this one would be ok. 
The waiter messed up our order and brought the wrong kind or pork.  Not a big deal.  Can happen.  But the annoying part was that he blamed us and said we told him the wrong thing. 
Ok whatever. Like I said not a huge deal at this point.  The annoying part was that all their portions were tiny.  The Jaeyook Bokkeum was tiny.  Literally maybe five or six pieces of pork spread out on the hot plate.  We also ordered the kalbi Jim for $35 bucks.  The portion was a joke.  It was tiny and the worst part was that they still had the stickers on the green peppers included in the dish.
When I reported it to the waiter he didn't care very much.  We were too embarrassed in front of our guests to make a huge deal about it and so we just let it go. 
Still tipped them 15 percent because it's not the waiters fault that the cook didn't wash or clean the veggies but for those of you who are thinking about eating here ... there are other restaurants that are better and cheaper."}
{"text":"This place has a tiny store front but is actually quite a large place inside.

Service is quiet and unassuming but they do come promptly when you push the bell.

We ordered fried dumplings, BBQ short ribs, and Sam sun jam pong.   Dishes come with 4 banchan (kimchi, pickled radish, cucumber kimchi, and chap chae noodles).  All the banchan were quite good.

The mains were very tasty as well.  They give you 3 options for rice (brown, brown with barley, brown with barley and beans).

The menu is quite extensive and a bit confusing as they seem to do different combinations of the same dishes for different prices and hard to compare what you are getting relative to price and portions.

 Definitely worth a trip back to try the extensive menu."}
{"text":"The restaurant was somewhat busy for a Sunday afternoon, but since the restaurant itself is quite large with plenty of seating, we were seated almost immediately.

One of my favourite things to get here is their lunch specials. They have a bento box style lunchchoice of meat then Ja Jyeung Myun (black bean noodles), gyoza, small salad, and rice. Their prices range from $9.99 to $11.99 and it comes with a pop! I generally get the pork chop, which comes with a perfectly tart and sweet plum sauce. For an extra $2, you can upgrade your noodles to a spicy seafood noodle soup. It's quite delicious and what I had ordered this time.

Their appetizers are unlimited and vary from day to day. One of my favourites is their glass noodle appetizer and their pickled spicy field cucumber.

All the servers are really nice, and are quite attentive. Since the restaurant is split into different sections, there is a bell on the table if you require service from someone. Almost immediately, a server will arrive and ask for what you need.

Their meat dumplings are also delicious and something to have with their Army Stew if you don't make it in for dinner!"}
{"text":"For starters - this place looks abit sketchy and small from the outside. Infact we missed it the first time and almost missed it the second time. Once walking in - it was quite spacious. 

Tip: make a reservation because they were packed! They don't accept reservations for groups under 4 people. They only have two tables in the whole restaurants to seat two people which is placed inconveniently near the entrance so it's abit awkward to have others watching you eat.

The service was fast and precise. We were in and out in about an hour and half. 

The ban chan was delicious and crisp with generous portions. 

We ordered the mul Mandu, beef rib soup, tang su yuk and beef teriyaki. 

The mul Mandu was pleasant and the filling flavourful.

The beef rib soup had a delicious broth with threads of chilli running through it leaving abit of spice. The only thing I didn't like is the very tough meat that was hard to remove from the bone and chew. 

The tang su yuk was delicious. It wasn't very crispy as I've been told to expect however the sauce tangy and sweet.

The beef teriyaki was very good. 

Overall, a very good first experience. We will be back!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a Korean BBQ place within reasonable driving distance from the Toronto Pearson International Airport and this is what Yelp recommended. We were quite surprised how big the restaurant was once we walked inside. It was a bit odd that there was cardboard on the floor by the entrance but given the weather outside we weren't all that surprised. I liked how the staff really welcomed us and took the time to explain the menu a bit before we ordered. The food was delicious! We had three dishes (along with the great sides that come with Korean BBQ!) to share for the 4 of us who ate together and it was a perfect amount of food. I was quite happy with the sides and with the flavour of the food that was presented. I'm glad we chose the small option rather than the large option for several of the dishes as it was plenty of food! We also arrived early in the evening and while the restaurant was nearly empty when we first got there, it got pretty busy by the time that we left. 

I would definitely recommend this place -- it doesn't look like much from the outside (a digital sign draws attention to the location but beyond that it's nothing much to look at) but inside the food is good, the tea is warm, and the restaurant, while worn, is busy."}
{"text":"Having a lazy day? May I suggest a super low key, low cost meal with a relaxed/chilled vibe? That is what I tend to be my recommendation for this Song's cook. We go here for two reasons, (1) the black bean noodle (Jjajangmyeon)-a lovely saucy noodle with black bean sauce and minced pork. A simple dish that can easily be overlooked and underappreciated. It is especially delicious here for the noodles they use. Cooked to the prefect consistency that leave a nice resistance and bounce to each bit, paired with the sauce to give diners a satisfying meal. By far, the best noodle I've had so far. (2) Their kimchi is bomb (awesome, fantastic, and bombastic)...I love their kimchi. It is especially fitting for the palate because of it's nice balance between the savoury and the sweet; it's not overly salty nor does it present the over fermented taste that most aged kimchi have (once kimchi gets to that strong tasting stage, I feel it's more of an acquired taste or most will use it for cooking/stewing. The kimchi at Song's cook is at that perfect stage of the fermentation process for eating. With all that being said, like most restaurants, there are good and bad. The good are noteworthy and I feel the negatives can be overlooked. Service can be a bit slow due to the sheer volume of the restaurant and staff are focused strict on the task at hand, very little interaction between them and the diners. I feel the \"eat and leave\" type of vibe at busier times. Some of the dishes on their menu are a bit hit and miss. The kamja tang lacked depth from a true stew...The broth lack the taste of the sweetness of the bones, thus leaving the bowl a bit flat. The fried pork tends to be chewy and a bit dry, lacking a crispy batter exterior to carry the dish. Their grill dishes are quite good but can be a bit costly for just a lazy night out. Overall, I love this restaurant for the stated reasons above and will continue to come back again and again. The goods are really good and the bads aren't all that bad. It's hard to beat a restaurant that I can come in, in my tracks-no makeup-and hair up...This place makes me a happy piggy"}
{"text":"Ordered beef tendon soup and noodles with soy bean paste.
Nothing outstanding, pretty average Korean place
Yonge/finch has way more authentic Korean places
Would not return"}
{"text":"One of the better Korean spots in Mississauga in terms of environment and quality of food. Although the prices are slightly higher than average, they have tons of specials that can be found on your place mat and the walls of the restaurant.

The menu is very extensive but I recommend coming here for the black bean noodles (jajangmyun) and you won't be disappointed. Hands down the best around. A bowl goes for $7.99 but you can get two for $12.99. Steal! These noodles will make you feel some type of way with its perfect consistency and chewiness. Along with the sides (kimchi, bean sprouts, stir-fried glass noodles, yellow pickled radishes), order a sweet & sour pork (tang soo yuk) to share and you'll be eating jajangmyun like a true Korean! The sweet & sour pork shows on the menu to be $21.99 but there's a poster on the wall offering it for only $16.99 as an every day special. Portions are extremely generous. We couldn't finish everything although we were starving.

From the outside, it really gives off a grungy, hole-in-the-wall kind of vibe. But you'll be surprised to find that it's very spacious with traditional decor (pretty much identical to the Song Cook's in Thornhill but without the floor seating). It's a very relaxing environment to come for a meal. I like that it's not too loud although the last time I came in it was a little TOO quiet (no music was playing). 

Never encountered any problems with service. They'll tend to you when you need it and everyone is friendly overall. Service is standardized for all patrons (which is a nice change from MANY Korean restaurants)."}
{"text":"Hot yummy Korean food! My shrimp bibimbob came sizzling on a hot stone bowl. Fresh ingredients and large portion for the price.  Decor a little dingy but if you don't care about that sort of thing, it's great!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times. Food here is quite salty before but I see lots of improvement this time. Service is ok only."}
{"text":"I used to like this place a lot.  Now, I think it is OK.

Why the change?

We go to Song Cook every two weeks, and this week when we went, here is the surprise they had for us:

1) the combo we used to order, soft tofu with meat dish, went up in price by $4.
2) then, they took out the pancake they used to have in the combo, at the same time they raised the price by $4.
3) We noticed they raised the price across the board.

I can accept, #1, and maybe #3, but doing #2 at the same time they raise the price is so not cool.  It is like McDonalds raising their combo price by 20%, and taking out the fries they used to include.   This was not nice of the owner.   It is just messed up.

My wife said she does not want to come here anymore.  I agree.  We will find another Korean restaurant to go to.

{"text":"Let me be clear, I rarely if ever give 2 stars to a restaurant becuase i usually go to restaurants after I checked their yelp rating and I see good reviews.
Unfortunately  this time around I was extremely disappointed.
I love Korean food and bulgogi is great when done right but these guys just totally messed up this thing.
The first thing is the tray. They bring the combo on a tray only seen in a hospital, discusting white tray.
The other thing is the items on the tray, the noodles were badly over cooked with some sauce on top that looked like it came out of a can, and sure enough it tasted like it too.
There's a tiny amount of rice and several items thrown together with grey minced meat on top.
So right off the bat the visuals are bad. Real bad. 
The taste was true to how it looks too. Average at best and for the first time in forever I didn't eat half of my food (that never happens)
I'm extremely disappointed! Would give it a one star if I..
Actually, I take it back. I am giving it one star."}
{"text":"After living in Korea for 3 years my friends and I are always looking for authentic restaurants true to South Korea cooking style and healthy ingredients. 

Song Cooks is expensive compared to the owls and other smaller Korean joints in Peel but it's worth it if you care about authenticity and flavors. 

Their menu also incorporates many items yoy don't see anywhere else such as Military Soup, intestines soup,  ginseng stuffed chicken soup and a bunch more. 

I've had their pork bone soup and bibimbap which I'm sure along with bulgogi is among their hottest sells. The pork bone soup is not super salty and has a very aromatic and flavorful broth. The table cooking portion is slightly smaller than owl but the individual size is the same. 

Their rice is expensive but they give you awesome options from white to brown to brown with barley and/or beans. It's a few bucks extra which is annoying but you got to do what you got to do. 

Spicy chicken table cooking duk galbi actually tastes like it should,  spicy and sweet and salty. Although I miss the pizza cheeses they used to throw on in SK.

Their side dishes are also really well done and not overly salty or old like other places. 

This is only skimming their huge menu with tons of offerings. 

All in all I'd deem this the#1 place in mississauga for authentic plentiful Korean dishes that takes me all the way back to Gwangju. 

Try the intestines soup... not as bad as one might think."}
{"text":"Yup, real deal corean food! Great service, great food, nice decor and proper K-pop on the tv screens...can't ask for more! I usually get the standard jajang myun and tang su yuk with a gun man do to start. I've had the bibimbop and pork bone soup too and they are both very solid!"}
{"text":"Grilled mackerel. Best  
Bibimbap with egg is also good. Use plenty of sauce stir quickly or it will burn.  

Pork bone soup i also my fav. 

Staff is quick and polite. They have push buttons to call the server and bill. 

Will return."}
{"text":"Great little Korean restaurant in Mississauga! Looks tiny from the outside but when you walk in it is very spacious with lots of tables. They even have some pop up walls if you want some extra privacy with a bigger group. My go to order is the spicy pork kalbi with jajongmyeon and I always have enough leftovers for another meal. 

Service can get a bit slow when it's busy, but the food is well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing here hands down  but the service is horrible.  I have been to several Korean restaurants in the area and the are very attentive but not this one."}
{"text":"Terrible. I had the tofu stew and it came out super watery. My significant other had soup as well and the same thing. When I brought the issue to the waiter, he was polite and offered to bring us new stews. The issue is this: it was too salty and spicy! I don't know why I come to this place! Way too much MSG. If after your meal, you feel like drinking lots of water? It's the MSG. Everything tastes salty but I guess that is better than it tasting bland."}
{"text":"The storefront is not exactly what you call noticeable and it may also seem like a small restaurant...but you are in for a surprise. The food is delicious, selection is endless and the space is great! I would say being between Dixie and Hurontario, is a pretty decent location as you will find a range of Asian restaurants.
I haven't been here a whole lot but whenever I have been or had take out, the food hits and spot and does not disappoint whatsoever- thinking about it right now, makes me want Korean food lol. In terms of selection, they have a good number of combo options for groups and individuals. The individual combo may look a little pricey but it is so worth it and it is actually a lot of food (for me at least). I loooove variety in my meals so I think this is perfect!
The Jajangmyun can be paired with a spicy seafood noodle/rice, fried chicken or pork, and I believe from what I recall tofu soup as well. There is also a soon tofu combo where you get a tofu soup and you choose protein dish to go with it- spicy pork, bulgogi, fish or dumplings. This also comes with a steamed egg and pancake. It's a lot of food but so yummy and fulfilling. There are so many choices if you are just looking for an entree or shareable items so I am sure you will find what you like.

Service is pretty quick and even with the place filling up, the service is still great. They also have sectioned rooms where larger groups can gather and main dining area with the rest of the tables.

Be sure to come hungry :)"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place for awhile now and I had a chance to do so today.

I was surprised how this place looks so small from the outside (no kidding) and I was \"prepared\" to seat myself in really tiny spots inside the restaurant if it calls for it. Little did I know that the place was actually quite roomy once you go in so  I was very pleased about that.

The layout of the place is interesting because of the wall dividers in some parts of the room and there's tiny (door less) cubicles where you can dine in with a group of people. That being said, the concept itself doesn't help the servers since they seem to have trouble noticing some of the customers when they call their attention. 

So if your ever there, it's either you make yourself \"heard\" so they know your ready for your order OR you patiently wait until they notice your done looking at the menu. I mean, its not a painful waiting game ... it just takes a little while until they take your order when your seated away from their line of vision if the place is really busy.

Anyway, the food is good and the menu packs a lot of variety compared to the WOW korean restaurant (also located in dundas, but just a bit further). THIS place packs the flavor. I love how the food is spicy and rich in texture. The price is inexpensive for 2 people and they serve a good portion of a meal. The side dishes wasn't that great so don't expect too much. 

Am quite puzzled as to why Song Cook is the restaurant's name but it's called \"Soft Tofu\" on the banner outside. It makes it a little weird trying to locate it when your looking for the actual name.

But do visit this place when your around the area if your looking for good korean food with more choices on the menu."}
{"text":"First visit they were closed early and it was annoying, last 2 visits; excellent food.
It's on the pricey side, if you are looking for SOLID Korean food in Mississauga; this is a great choice (lot of hit and miss nearby)."}
{"text":"This is our to go Korean restaurant in sauga. We come here very often and we are always happy and satisfied with the food. The service is pretty good compare to most asian restaurants. I love their \"special\" menu and it is different from time to time. You can actually save some money from ordering there. 

Korean restaurants are known for their side dishes. Song Cook's may not have the best varieties, however their main courses (noodles, soups, bbq...ect) are pretty amazing. 

I recommend this place and we will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend brought me here today for my birthday treat. It looked like a really small place from the outside, but was really big and spacious inside. 

So, I had the spicy seafood with extra seafood (spicy). I really really loved the broth and we also had the pork dumplings, which were sosososo good. 
I really liked this place. would def come again."}
{"text":"From first look (the signage outside and the interior), it resembles the Song Cook's in North York very much. The menu differs slightly... more soft tofu soup options. 
We found the food very flavorful however our request for less spiciness was ignored. We ordered seafood + kimchi tofu pot and kimchi + pork tofu pot. The jajang myeon is quite good and one of my favorites to order. 
We were seated in an obscure location and the call button was handy but service wasn't prompt like others say. 
The little dishes that arrive just before the meal is standard with Korean meal. A plate of grilled fish and 4pcs of kalbi shortribs were included (to our surprise). Server realized it's a mistake and took it away even though we had already ate some. I thought that was a stingy move since it was their mistake to begin with. They can't re-serve a fish with chunks of meat removed anyway."}
{"text":"This place is probably is the most hidden place in the world.  It's next to a mattress store and has a bunch of signs on the outside (none of which say \"Song Cook's\".  Good luck with that one.

Anywho, upon entering, it's as if you've gone through  wall an into Diagon Alley.  Really, from a inconspiuous wall comes a restaurant that pretty much looks like the most stereotypical korean restaurant, weird.  I'm actually surprised about how big the place actually is.

I came here at lunch so I decided to order the Gam Ja Tang because I wanted to see how good they did it.  I also ordered the Gyoza.

The Gyoza were pretty good.  Kinda a little bit different cause they were boiled and covered with soy sauce and sesame oil.  Either way I really liked them.

The Gam Ja Tang was meh... It wasn't that special, nor memorable.  I've had way better. 

As for the price, it's mediocre, I'd probably go to the asian food court to get similar food for way cheaper."}
{"text":"I came here with my parents on a long weekend for lunch and had a pleasant time. The servers were all very nice and helpful.

I ordered the single portion JTF Army Stew as I was looking for some noodle soup and I have always wanted to try the army stew. It needed a little bit more cheese and overall it was underseasoned. I guess it's better not as salty than over salty. I added in their kimchi banchan to add some more flavour.

My mom ordered the Pork Bone Soup. It was pretty standard and flavourful so no problems there. We also ordered a Grilled Mackerel on the side which was also very good but I wish the lemon wedge was just a little bigger so I could squeeze at least some juice on top. Other than that, all good.

My dad ordered from their lunch menu and got the Pork Katsu bento which comes with a nice sweet/sour sauce, a serving of Jajangmyun (black bean noodles), a small salad and rice portion and 3 fried mandoos (dumplings). Good value for the amount of food, I am a fan of their jajangmyun and also their dumplings!

Good, hearty, authentic Korean food. A few of their items are a bit pricey but at least it tastes pretty good."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place after my first visit but a second visit kinds seals it for me. First time I ate there, the dish I had was alright but a little lacking in flavour, although some people may like it that way. The one this that was noticeable right away though was the slow service.

The second time I went, service seemed even slower and the place was not packed. The food we ordered the second time as well was nothing special.

I would recommend Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu over this place. They have a smaller menu but all of the items I have tried are way more flavourful."}
{"text":"This restaurant is usually consistent with their quality of food. I come for the lunch special back when it was 8.99 instead of 10.99 now and it's only been a few years. 

Their lunch special comes with the side dishes, pop, and the main meat with rice and noodles! Whoa, but there's more! It comes with two gyozas and salad as well! The portions are good and will leave you satisfying for your hunger!

Pork cutlet is not too dry and they have a sweet BBQ sauce on the side to serve with your pork.

All in all, it is still a good place to go to despite the price hike but for me personally, I suppose it became less worth in my opinion. I've yet to try the other menu items since I only come for lunch."}
{"text":"Seriously craving soft tofu stew so we came here. 

Ordered the 

(1)soft tofu stew: average but satisfied craving
(2)udong with seafood: SO BAD. broth was flavorless, and the ingredients were sloppy and didnt fit together..dont order!!"}
{"text":"Very good food! Good service.. and they serve Chinese food and Korean cuisine. People next to me ordered steam dumplings. It looks so good! Will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 stars. My fiancé and I frequent Song Cook's whenever we're looking for a good, affordable Korean meal. They have an extensive menu and plenty of variety. 

The portions are good and if you feel like trying different dishes then I suggest getting one of their combos, I usually order the half Jajangmyun (black bean noodles) and half khanpoungki (sweet and spicy chicken). We have also tried the Jim Kal Bi which is their steamed beef ribs in special sauce which were nice and tender but should be a bigger serving considering the price. 

You get a decent amount of banchan (side dishes) which consist of standard Korean fare - kimchi, bean sprouts (regular and spicy), pickled radish and spicy cucumber. 

The service is good here, your tea is regularly refilled piping hot and there is even a call button on your table to press whenever you need anything."}
{"text":"Mississauga (in my opinion) has previously lacked a good selection of Korean restaurants, but perhaps I am just ignorant and unadventerous in walking into one of the many random Korean establishments that are located around Dundas.

At the recommendation of a friend, we came to Song Cook's and were surprised at how large the place was! As other reviews have pointed out, the place is inconspicuously hidden between mattress and furniture stores.

There is plenty of seating inside and were shown to our table rather quickly. The menu was extensive and I decided to go with the Gam Ja Tang. It was a rather large soup with a side of purple rice. The meal itself was good, but nothing special in terms of Gam Ja Tang. I would come back to try one of their other dishes - perhaps the jjajangmyun."}
{"text":"The ambience is great. It looked so small from the outside but the moment you went in, you feel as if you travelled to Japan. The staff was good and the menu was eclectic. One of the better spots for Korean food in Mississauga next to owl of Minerva. Would go back."}
{"text":"So we were on our way to WOW down the street and I spotted the sign for Authentic Korean Food and decided that today was the day to try a new experience. And let me tell you what a great Idea this was.

The restaurant looks small from the outside but when you walk in it opens up into this large deep restaurant that was very nice and clean. 

The food was actually amazing. Very, very flavorful and the spicy dishes are actually spicy.  

and Overall the prices were very reasonable as well.

if your looking for good authentic Korean.. this is the spot in Mississauga.. well one of them at least...

Go try.. NOW!"}
{"text":"No complaints here. Excellent customer service,  authentic food, and speedy service. They serve purple rice with beans in it; yum! Our server was sweet and giggled as we attempted to order our food in Korean. We ordered gam ja tang and kalbi tang. It's in a bit of an odd location but worth finding!"}
{"text":"We had a group of 6 for our monthly get together. We wanted to try something new. We've done Korean BBQ but never an a-la-carte. 

We were seated immediately and our waiter was actually the chef of the restaurant. He treated us all so well, made us feel welcome and was very helpful and informative when it came to choosing items off the menu.

I can speak on behalf of our group in saying that this place was really great. I ordered the spicy pork with rice. It came on a sizzling plate. When they brought it to us you could smell the spiciness of the pork (I love spicy food so I was excited to dig in). The chef came and checked on us every once in a while. 

They are priced fairly - no complaints here.

The restaurant itself was very clean. There is a pot of fresh green tea on the table when you're seated and they refill as needed. 

Overall a very good first experience of Korean a-la-carte. 

Will definitely recommend and return."}
{"text":"We came in a late night with a hungry empty tummy. We took awhile to browse through the menu as they have a good varieties of Korean dishes and it is hard to decide what to have.
We settled with JaJangmyun (black bean noodles), Ddeokbokki (spicy rice cake) combo and Bimbimbap. 

During our wait, we were served with some tasty sides and warm corn tea. 
The combo tastes good but I prefer a spicier version of spicy rice cake in personal. Maybe I will let the waiter know my preferences when I make my order. 

The meal is decent and the only drawback is the quality of the rice. The rice is not fresh and tend to be way too \"soft\". I am referring to the Bimbimbap I ordered. (As the rice supposed to be crisp in order to gives out a different contrast to the ingredients.) But it might be a good idea to bring your grandparents over here for meals. :p"}
{"text":"Their spicy is REALLY spicy, but the dishes are exploding with flavor!! The server was super friendly and very welcoming. The atmosphere is also fairly peaceful and calming even when there are plenty people."}
{"text":"I thought this place was ok.  Menu is very extensive including various posters with Specials all over wall.  Menu also includes Specials for each day of the week + tons of combo options (w/ Soju), so it's good for groups.  And for vegetarians, there's even a menu for you!  Could be a downside if you're feeling indecisive that particular day.

There's a call button on each table which I thought was very good!  So you if you prefer, you'll be left alone.  Restaurant itself is much, MUCH LARGER than it appears, quite updated contrary to the location.

Sides were just ok in my option, only 3 for 2ppl.  However, I did bump into an old acquaintance who was there and she had like 6 different varieties.  They were smaller, but I did notice that she had different items.

I ordered the Soon Tofu (w/ tuna) + Beans Rice ($10.99) and it was hot (temperature-wise), quite spicy (to the point my nose was running), & sour all at the same time.  I was turned off by the 'sour' taste which probably was from the loads and loads of kimchi that was inside.  Tuna was probably a quarter/half of a can.  Tofu stew did not come with a raw egg and I didn't notice egg as an ingredient.  Still not as good as my usual tofu stew place, so perhaps I shouldn't have ordered this.

Good, quick, efficient, & polite service.  Wouldn't be opposed to coming back, but I'll order something else!"}
{"text":"By far the best korean restaurant in Mississauga. A little bit pricey but that's ok as long as the food and the service is great!! Will post food pictures soon!"}
{"text":"This is by far the BEST korean food I've ever had.

I'm in Mississauga a lot during the weekends and this weekend I was craving some Pork Bone soup. I've been to 3 different korean restaurants (all my finds were through Yelp), but this one definitely beats them all. This place was small on the outside but when my boyfriend and I walked into the restaurant, this place was a lot bigger then expected, filled with Korean families enjoying meals.

The menu was at least 5-6 pages long with a wide variety of different apps, entrees and combos. All of the meals were reasonably priced and instead of calling the servers... there were bell buttons at each table (which makes it extremely convenient). I had asked our server what was popular on their menu and he was really kind and showed me four different recommendations and popular dishes. 

I ordered their famous pork bone soup and replaced my white rice for Brown rice, barley and beans (additional 2 bucks), my boyfriend ordered pork Kalbi with white rice and we got a take out meal of spicy pork Katsu that came with rice and a side of kimchi. Our side dishes that came were onions that were marinated with a sauce, pickled radishes and kimchi. 

The pork bone soup came with two scrumptious extremely meaty pieces of pork bone, cabbage, potatoes and topped off with bean sprouts. The brown rice, barley and beans were so good and healthy... it hit the spot. My boyfriends pork Kalbi was delicious too.

The service, atmosphere, and overall experience was great. The food was the best Korean food I've ever had and i would most definitely recommend this place to anyone in the area. I would come back to try other things on their menu."}
{"text":"F*** man I was so wanting to love this place.

1.   Cold inside the restaurant;
2.   Panchan - 4 dishes of the most unappetizing panchan.  Potato, miyuk, mat-kimchi which was totally bland and vegetable-less/flavourless \"chap-chae\";
3.   Mae-oon tang:  big slices (clearly cut up in a hurry) dumped into the mae-oon (which wasn't that mae-oon) tang.  Major friggin' disappointment.  Brown rice as hard as a rock (and cold);
4.   Spouse's kimchi-chigae - lucklustre.

What a massive disappointment.  This for me did not epitomize in any way the Korean-food experience.

Suggestion:

1.  Use more gochu;
2.  Heat your restaurant;
3.  Spend a bit more on panchan.  The cheap stuff tastes cheap and is not a good way to start.

Very disappointed. MIYAN HAMNIDAH!"}
{"text":"Came to this restaurant after reading well reviews on this place. It was my wife, 2 kids and my parents.  The menu had a lot of delicous items and a mid range price point.  Ordered there traditional meals and ordered their beef rib stew.  For $20 for appetizers you I'd imagine a huge portion of food.  Nope it was like 4 beef bones and soup not impressed at all.  The rest of the food was okay nothing special nothing that really made go Whoa!!!! With the money spent i wished i gone to AYCE Korean BBQ.  Definitely give this place another shot by myself to recon whats really good in hood.  Wanna make sure i am getting their fan favorite foods here.  Service is great and environment is also nice.  Location sucks because parking is a pain there. Nevertheless ill try again"}
{"text":"This place may look really tiny from the outside but it's actually really spacious. There's plenty of seating so there's usually no wait. It's probably one of the only store in Sauga that offers a large variety on their menu. They have single items, sets and shareable items. Some items you can't get elsewhere. 

They make the best spicy pork here ! One of the best I've tried. It's so tasty and flavourful. If you order a medium it comes with one rice, if you order a large it comes with two rices. 

The bibimbap is also really good but nothing too special. If you order the large Bibimbap, the portions are huge but it doesn't come in a hot stone pot. Rather it comes in a big metal bowl. It isn't as hot as the single portion bibimbap but it's still delicious. One order can feed 2-3 people. 

They have a variety of soups. I usually get the spicy seafood soup or the kimchi pork soup. They all come with rice on the side. 

Jajangmyun here is okay. It's one of the typical things you see people in kdramas eating. It's noodles with black bean sauce. 

If you're unsure of what to order. They also have a set menus where you can try small portions of two different items. 

As for rice. Some of the things you order comes with the special rice, others just come with white rice. So if you prefer white rice over the other kinds remember to tell your waiter. If you prefer the special rice and it doesn't come with your meal. You can change it for a charge. 

They have daily specials where some items are slightly cheaper.  This place is a little pricier than average but the food delicious."}
{"text":"You cannot judge a book by it's cover, and you cannot judge a restaurant by it's front door.  What a surprise to walk in a nondescript small storefront and find a delightfully spacious dining room.  The place is definitely authentic.

I was dining solo, so they put me in a section with five other tables with the flat-screen TV mounted for perfect viewing of a K-Pop station.  A little odd to say the least, but after a few minutes I was drawn into all the singing and dancing on the screen.

The menu is large and the variety was plentiful.  I chose one of their meals for one for $17.99, because it gave me the most variety and bang for my buck.  I was not disappointed!  The meal came with banchan (though only three instead of the usual 5-6), a Korean pancake, and I chose pork kalbi, steamed egg, and seafood soup.  They also have three different options for rice.  

The pork kalbi was by far the best I've tasted.  It was marinated just right and the sauce was excellent.  It was spicy but not overly hot.  All the other dishes were good too.  The disappointment was the seafood soup.  The broth was lacking flavor and substance.  I will select a different one next time.

I will gladly come again when I visit Mississauga.  I am here a couple of times a year for business and will put Song Cook's as one of my go-to places!"}
{"text":"This was my first time dining at this particular location. I loved the coziness of the restaurant. Walking in, the staff was friendly and brought us to our seats right away. We didn't have to wait for a table, even though it was quite busy during lunch time. Since my husband and I invited a friend for authentic korean food, we wanted to pick some dishes she would like (she's never had korean food before).

I ordered pork bone soup (kamja-tang), black bean noodles with sweet and sour pork combo (jiajiamyun & tangsuyuk), and fermented bean paste stew (dwen-jang gigae)

The food came out with an array of side dishes. I had asked the server to prepare our sweet and sour pork separate from the sauce, so that we can dip the fried pork in the sweet and sour sauce. To ensure the pork stays crispy till we finish the dish and not drenched by the sauce.

The noodle combo with sweet and sour pork was a smaller portion but it was nice for her to try. The pork bone soup was very flavorful and delicious as well as the bean paste stew with loads of tofu. Deli!

I recommend this restaurant to those seeking out a friendly and delicious Korean place to eat!"}
{"text":"This place is OK. I mean the food is good, but considering the price and portion I don't see myself coming here very often. 

I ordered the soontofu and pork kimchi stew. The broth was amazing!! It was the perfect balance of spicy and sweetness from the Kim chi. BUT... the portion was small af. I was still a bit hungry after eating it and I always get full quickly at restaurants that my boyfriend has to finish my food for me lol - not the case here .... there was just way too much tofu and I'm not even kidding, I literally had three pieces of pork. Really ? That was a joke.. disappointing, because I really did enjoy the broth. 

My boyfriend got the same thing but with tuna, he could not find any tuna and again, way too much tofu. And if I was still a bit hungry after finishing my food, he was still really hungry after his meal! Our stew was $13.50 EACH for a small ass bowl of soup that is 3/4 tofu. 

We also ordered the dumplings, they were super tiny! $10 for 15 tiny dumplings seem a bit ridiculous. 

I've been here before, I'd say go for their value meals/combos because it is more worth it. Their black bean sauce noodles are really good and they have a bunch of combos around $12 for half size noodles and another item of your choice. 

Service wise it's ok. I like that they have the button to call for help, though it still took a while for a server to come to my table. Also, I found it weird that our stew came out before our rice? Our rice came about 5 minutes after ... it isn't long but when you're hungry it feels like an eternity and the girl who dropped it off didn't mention anything about the rice being served later so we assumed they just forgot....

Will I come back? Likely, but only for their combo meals with the black bean sauce. Every time I order something other than that I get so disappointed with the portion. If you're craving kim chi stew, you're better off heading to owls.. only $10.99 for bigger portion and more meat."}
{"text":"Favourite Korean restaurant in town. a+ for their pork bone soup which I get every visit."}
{"text":"This place is by far best Korean eatery in Mississauga.  I grew up in Korea and Los Angeles so I know my Korean food.   Their menu is wide in selection and includes dishes you normally don,t find in other Korean restaurants such as - army stew and duk kalbi."}
{"text":"Okay I don't know how I didn't find this place sooner! This has got to be my fave Korean spot in Mississauga. I got the jajangmyeon special with the pork cutlet and it was delicious! Their bulgogi, khampungi, fried dumpling, gamjatang, even their kimchi were all delicious! Yes, as with everyone, this place looks so small and sketchy on the outside and once you enter it's shockingly spacious! I've never been here during it's busy days so it was great for me and my boyfriend as we didn't have to wait long to get a seat. Overall great experience!"}
{"text":"There's a reason why Song Cook's has been in business for so long. It's the consistency of food and service which they deliver day in and day out.

This was my second time coming to Song Cook's. Dale was polite to my guest and I and continued to ensure that everything was well during our meal. He introduced us to Wendy who was professional and even taught us some Korean phrases while we ate. My guest and I felt very welcome and comfortable throughout our entire meal.

Decor was good. The high ceilings and fancy chandeliers make a big impact on dining experience. You are given the option of floor seating or chair seating which gives you the choice of a more traditional experience or comfortable one. The atmosphere is very casual and chill. It's got a good level of noise and murmur so everyone can have a private conversation. It's fairly common to see babies and children around because Song Cook's is family friendly.

Food was legit. If you're looking for traditional Korean food of all varieties, Song Cook's has the capacity to deliver anything on their menu and make it tasty. However, like any restaurant, Song Cook's does have certain items they're known for. Jajang myun (black bean noodles) are definitely one of the staple items at Song Cook's. We had the combo with sweet and sour pork and spicy chicken. Food was cooked very well however the pork was small in the fried batter. Also, the side dishes included pickled radish and kimchi which tasted great but variety was low relative to other restaurants.

Our experience at Song Cook's was pleasant and we look forward to coming back for more."}
{"text":"I went into Soft Tofu thinking it was a japanese place. I ordered chicken teriyaki and assorted vegtables without egg. They brought a yellow vegtable that tasted like mild ginger and kimichi first. There was only green tea to drink which was OK with me. I had both my and my mother's soup which was very yummy! The food was really good except the purple rice that i didn't like at all. I'll definatly go back!!!"}
{"text":"Song cooks has now become my favourite Korean restaurant in Mississuaga. I love that that they have seasonal specials and can't get enough of the hwe dup bap. The serving size is extremely generous, service is prompt and efficient, and they don't skimp on the bachan's. 
Also, no other Korean restaurant here has such an authentic ambiance and decor."}
{"text":"My favourite place for kamjatang and bibimbap! I love the kamjatang here because the flavourful broth makes it comfort food. However, I wished they would put perilla seeds to perfect it. They're pretty generous with the banchan and their kimchi is worth a try.

The place is usually busy during the dinner time so a lineup at the entrance is not uncommon. It's totally worth it to drop by for lunch as they have lunch combos and daily lunch specials. Price is worth for what you'll be getting so expect to spend about $10-15 per person."}
{"text":"I think it's the best Korean restaurant in Mississauga.  I have tried Ginseng Chicken soup ( feeling so healthy lol) and different noodles."}
{"text":"Awesome Korean food with huge portions. The side dishes were good, and so was the bibimbap combo I got, which included salad, dumplings and some delicious jajangmyeon. The bibimbap was cold though so keep that in mind. The service was quick with the call buttons embedded into the table. Prices were pretty low too especially considering how much you get."}
{"text":"What to try? 

Their soon tofu and their ja jang myun! Soon tofu because it's literally packed with tofu in the stone pot!! And it's really delicious with jalapeño. Where can you find the soon tofu with sliced jalapeño to add the kick this dish needs? Not common in other Korean restaurants. Their ja jang myun is a good deal if you order two! You get two for the price of $10 which means it's $5 each. What a steal! We ordered their set dinner menu and we thought it was a good idea since you get quite a bit of food for a great value instead of ordering separately. The only downside is that set dinners are set, and may not have all the dishes you want. 

Last tip?

Can't emphasize enough, try their set dinner menu if you have more than 3 ppl in your party. They have different offerings depending on how many ppl are in your party so you can choose from a variety of set menus. And try their specials of the day too."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to go to for Korean food. I usually go Sunday for lunch since we're near that area and it's a bonus they have a lunch special. Prices have increased throughout the years (I go here a lot) but it's still pretty worth for the amount of food you get. I'm not a big fan of pork bone soup but I did try the soup base and it was quite flavourful. From the lunch special I always get the pork katsu deal which includes a slice of katsu, rice, 2 fried dumplings, black bean noodles (can place this with cham pong (seafood noodle soup) with $2 charge, salad, and a choice of drink (miso or pop). There's about 5 options you can choose from and differs in price. Next to the lunch menu, I would only get soft tofu with dumplings in it as I'm not a fan of seafood and the rest of the soft tofu dishes were seafood. The soup is spicy. I love spicy so it's at a good level for me to enjoy. There's about 2-3 dumplings in it and a lot of veggies (kimchi and onions) mostly. It comes with a side of rice and I usually get purple rice. This dish is.. rather pricey. $13.50 but it wouldn't stop me from getting the same thing haha. 
It's easy to split the bills and accepts cash/debit/credit. 

Came here again for lunch and instead of getting the lunch special, I got the combo for one person. There's 6 options but I picked the one that came with black bean noodle and a side of dumplings. Dumplings are always great here. They're fried but not crispy crispy? weird ain't it. Kinda like no flakes or anything but it's crisp haha. 
Black bean noodles are always my fav here. Hands down fav place"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times. I usually only come here when I crave their spicy pork and rice or their yukgaejang. 

Both these dishes are really flavorful and yummy. This place is my favorite place to get these dishes because they make it the best! 

Other than that, they offer a variety of other dishes. I've tried their teriyaki chicken. Avoid ordering this because it's not good. This is probably one of the worst dish here. 

I've also order kimchi stew, this ones average. You can find the similar taste else where 

The bibimbap is pretty good. We usually get the one that's not in the stone pot because the portion is larger and can be share among a few people. 

As for service the service is a hit or miss. Sometimes they are really attentive, other times they aren't."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times so far. 
Especially when I crave : jajangmyeon. Not too salty. Hits the spot.
Reasonable on the pocket, not too fancy and they have that button on the table for quick service. The sides are kinda random when I look at other tables."}
{"text":"A regular haunt for when my friends and I want Korean fare in Mississauga!

ATMOSPHERE: Spacious dining room split into various sections. There are a lot of small rooms for more privacy. Great place for any-sized party. The vibe is low-key and casual. TVs offering Korean entertainment can be seen in any seat in the house.

SERVICE: Good. Quick and attentive.

PRICE: Affordable. A lot of combos at great prices!

FOOD: The only place I've been to where they are so generous with their kim chi. It's served as full cabbage leaves! Scissors are provided for you to cut down to preferred size. Other ban chans are good too.

I love all their food. Everything's been consistent. And because it's so hard to pick just one dish, I really appreciate the wonderful combos they offer!

Go with more people so you can order the bigger combos."}
{"text":"3.5 stars - I've been coming here a few times every now and then when I'm in the area and the food is always pretty good. Lately, I've noticed that some of the portion sizes are getting smaller - not sure why.

Recently I ordered their pork bone soup and the amount of meat that I got was really negligible compared to before and compared to other places. I usually get full after I finish the dish and the rice but I was still hungry afterwards - I filled myself up with the side dishes. I also tried the soondaegook (blood sausage soup) which was a huge disappointment and really different than other places. It was served in an almost transparent broth - which is much different that what I'm used to as I believe it is typically served in a red spicy broth flavoured with the gochujang. Maybe it was made differently here or it was a different style, but either way, it wasn't really appetizing. There was also only like 4 pieces of the blood sausage in the broth too. 

This place has other great dishes though. I really like the jajangmyeon and the great affordable lunch deals! Maybe I won't come back here for the dishes I talked about above but I would definitely come back here for some of their other dishes."}
