{"text":"Staying in a local hotel that has a Carol's menu in the binder. Ordered a large pizza with 1/2 bacon for the family on the 4th of July and it was great! It was done just the way I like it which is crust that is nicely browned but not burnt. Delivery was very quick. Couldn't ask for more."}
{"text":"I grew up on Casey's pizza. It has changed since I was a kid. Not my fav anymore.  There hoagies are awsome!"}
{"text":"Pizza was just Ok. Does not live up to the hype. they usually got our order wrong and it takes to long to get it made, and don't even try delivery. You will wait forever for cold pizza."}
{"text":"Terrible, terrible quality. This is the standard pizza/pasta service for lunch meetings at my local work place. It did not take me long to determine that I'd rather go hungry than try to digest this free foolish substance.   The only thing more rubbery than their pasta is their pizza crust. Toppings are sparse and of a consistency only achievable if thawed from frozen. They do seem to be able to achieve a good deal of grease from the cheese they use. Somehow, that seems to be a plus around the office.   This place honestly makes papa johns look like a high quality, authentic Italian option. And that's really saying something."}
{"text":"I've had two horrible experiences coming from this pizza shop. The first happened a year ago. I placed an order for delivery, as usual they asked for my address and phone number. After giving my information, I placed my order which came to a total of $30.00 and some change, I then paid with my debit card. They told me the wait would be approximately 45 mins. My family and I patiently waited. After an hour and a half and still no food, it was time to call and check. To my surprise the person over the phone told me they did not deliver to my area(which was about a 15 min drive). I then asked for a full refund to be credited back on my debit card, but was told that they would not do that and I had to come in to pick up the food or my money. I could not come to them so they basically they stole my $30. The next incident happened today. My co-workers ordered food for lunch, and instructed that the food needed to be there at 11:30am and we're told that it would be there at 11:20am. They also paid with their card. Their food did not arrive until 12:40pm almost an hour after lunch was over.(this time a 6 min drive down Rodi road) Not to mention the order was missing food, and the driver sat in his car for 7 mins on the phone. I WOULD ABSOLUTELY NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE EVER. Especially if you're paying with a card. It seems once they get your money they could care less how they treat you. So much for supporting local business."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza in Pittsburgh!  Carol's has lots of great food including wings, salads, calzones, strombolis, gyros, wraps, hoagies, focaccia & pocket sandwiches, pasta and red, white, sicilian and specialty pizzas. My two favorite pizzas are the barbecue chicken and bacon and the steak and mushroom pizza. They are both delicious!   Carol's offers fast delivery for $1 with a $10 minimium order."}
{"text":"I don't get Casey's unless I am in a desperate situation.  I was in the neighborhood and needed a pizza so I tried to order one.  I will agree my order could be seen as high maintenance although other places readily do it.  I asked for a large pizza with ¾ pepperoni and ¼ cheese.  I was quickly told the order could not be put in because it was stupid and the cooks get mad.  \"I can't do stupid stuff like dhat.\"  No problem, I got a pizza from a different place that was more than happy to take my order.  I told them about the Casey's situation and they stated that they like to make their customers happy.  It's a shame Casey's does not feel the same way."}
{"text":"OK. So. I wrote a negative review about this place a few months ago after some really odd and strange attempts to order in person (see previous review)....anyway, someone recently told me the staffing has changed so I have tried it 2 times since last review.....(including just yesterday)....the staff has changed.....for the better......the young woman who took my order last night was very very very nice......a few months ago, I literally felt like the staff was part of Charles Mansons gang.......they were nasty, gross looking tattoo prison gang looking people who when I walked in just leered at me.....it was really unsettling....another time, some lady just totally ignored me at the counter......I was invisible ! It was odd.....anyway, my 2 recent visits were great from a customer service standpoint and the food was OK......it wasn't anything exceptional and if the place was 15 minutes away, I wouldn't make the drive, but it's like 3 minutes from my house and convenient, decent food and (lately) very good customer service.....so.....there's my update for this place......only other thing I will say........parking is TERRIBLE......its a inconvenient parking arrangement being right at the entrance of the shopping center......but lots of parking by the Biglots but then you have to cross traffic, with your pizzas and hope no one hits you lol Anyway, I just have to point out that the employees are recently very nice people and I appreciate that."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza shops in Penn Hills the pizza and Stromboli are excellent most of the time. The only problem is they are not consistent enough. I've had a few issues with the food over the years and delivery service has been so terrible I only pickup now. One time it took 2.5 hours for delivery and no it wasn't like Super Bowl Sunday or anything just a normal day. All that said one of my go to spots you have to give them a shot"}
{"text":"By the time I was done reading all the reviews I definitely didn't want to order but something told me to give them a try. The staff was very polite and welcoming. I ordered a half of a steak hoagie and the S#%* was  everything down to the mayo tasted fresh... WAIT BUT IT WAS ONLY 5.15 BEST STEAK HOAGIE IN PENNHILLS"}
{"text":"Mediocre would be too generous. Ordered 2 Stromboli, a veggie, and a pepperoni & sausage. My boyfriend was happy with his meat pocket, but the veggie Stromboli I ordered was sickening. Not only was it incredibly soggy, but the mushrooms were raw & the green peppers tasted canned.... The sauce was beyond bland, and probably from a jar. Thank goodness for the small salad I also got. A chunk of anemic iceberg lettuce with a couple thin cucumber pieces and maybe a quarter of a tomato slice was the highlight here. Also I wonder if they buy Papa John's dough and try to pass it off? Can't wait to order again... NOT"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews for this place I initially regretted placing an order. When I arrived to pick up lunch, my pizza was coming out of the oven! The cook realized that the crust was charred and insisted that he made us another one. However, I was on lunch break so I told him I really couldn't wait (plus as you can see from the picture it is not burnt THAT bad). He then insisted that we take our order free of charge and also threw in some fried dough and bread sticks on the house!  To me, that is exceptional customer service. Most places would've boxed up the pizza the way it was and still charge us for it. I loved the pizza and the fries dough was amazing. Wasn't the best pizza I've ever had but I would definitely get it again. Didn't really care for the breadsticks, but hey they were free. I am proud to write this yelp review and hope that future potential customers disregard the other reviews and give this place a definite shot!"}
