{"text":"Absolutely delicious!! Get the avocado green curry, so yummy!  We will be back for sure, probably weekly. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food. Been there 3+ times now. Haven't been disappointed. Wasn't a fan of Currey before but they are making me a fan. Hint: make sure you give them a \"Spice Rating \" on your curry. I like spicy food, and a \"4\" works well for me. Nice family setting."}
{"text":"We live near by and have been waiting for a Thai restaurant to open up close by. We went on a saterday at lunch and it was very busy. The food was very good and they had a very good menu to order from. The service was slow but the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Nice decor. Friendly staff with the exception with one girl- she could learn to smile more. Food was delicious! I ordered the lunch special - vegan green curry. I also ordered for deliver the next day. My order arrived early by 15 minutes - good job! I ordered chicken panang curry, sprimp pad Thai and garlic sauce with chicken. My husband enjoyed it too. Will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Just opened today! Was seated and served free Thai tea even though we ordered takeout. Awesome customer service and well prepared for opening day  thank you to Dutch!"}
{"text":"This is a great find new restaurant and very good food and great vegan options. Staff was very friendly and service was great. You can tell they are trying their hardest to move things along and at good pace for everyone. I travel a lot for work and use yelp as my guide for food. This was a good find!"}
{"text":"We went there opening night and wow what a great place. Seated immediately by the host which was great as there were 9 of us. Place is very clean and love the decor. Everything we ordered was delicious esp. the pineapple fried rice and the red curry catfish. Would also definitely recommend the green tea and papaya salad.  The staff is very friendly and frequently checked up on us without being a nuisance. Def going back soon to try more dishes."}
{"text":"The ambiance is very nice and the staff is very nice and informative. We came in for the vegan menu and everything was on point. We had the pad Thai, fried rice, corn cakes and the spring rolls. I can't complain about anything. The flavor and presentation were great, and the food came out hot and fast. What more could you want?"}
{"text":"This place is great. We love there drunken noodles and chicken satay!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Thai restaurant in Las Vegas/Henderson. The food is amazing!!! You gotta try the tempura spinach!!! It's an incredible appetizer!!! Good size portions, great lunch specials and a very friendly staff. I'm so full, but I'm already thinking about the next time I'll be back. Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"This is new to the neighborhood and I went to check it out. The ambiance of the place is wonderful and despite being smaller than my usual Thai spot, I think this is a great addition. 

Take note that their spicy levels are different than most but no complaints from me for a level 8 pad Thai! Their Thai Tea is also to crave for. 

There is definitely more to this place than what I have already ordered and I am hoping to get more chances to enjoy the cuisine they have to offer!"}
{"text":"Excellent service!! Delicious food.  Staff very friendly and accommodating. Excellent homemade chili sauce, also vegan."}
{"text":"Delicious.  We tried the Mongolian beef and green curry chicken. They were both excellent and came with a side of rice.  We also tried the Thai Tea and it was heavenly.  We never had it before and wow. Also it's Vegan - who knew.  So good and the gentleman waiting on us was lovely.  He spent time connecting with us and making us feel very welcome.  We can't wait for a return visit soon."}
{"text":"Have been hitting up this place for lunch for the last couple months. I haven't ventured beyond my usual favorites Pad Thai and Pad See Ew, but they have very tasty versions of both. Service is always friendly and attentive. Prices very reasonable. The way a restaurant should run!"}
{"text":"Walked into thailicious with high expectations after reading the great reviews. The person behind the counter never greeted anyone in our group or the group before. He just said \"seating for 4?\" And walked us to a table and left the menus stacked at the center. We ordered food and after waiting twenty minutes it arrived and the my pad see we arrived. It was a small portion for the price and undercooked . Rather then continuing to eat it, we just asked for the check and left. Too many other Thai locations in town with better service and food."}
{"text":"This is the best place for vegan thai food! The atmosphere inside is nice and open. I never felt crowded even with a full restaraunt. It is in a nice convenient area right off the freeway. Prices are great and the staff is amazing."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great location and good spicy Thai food. Ordered Salmon cho Chee with spice level of 8 came out perfect for my palate."}
{"text":"We love this place! If you like Le Thai downtown, you'll love this place too! Happy there is some yummy Thai food over in Hendo with great service. Probably some of the nicest servers I've ever had at a Thai restaurant. LOVE that they have tons fo vegan options and you know that it is clean. The interior is cute considering the unassuming exterior."}
{"text":"I travel quite a bit to Vegas and always look at yelp when I'm fine trying to find food options. This restaurant will not disappoint! I I love Thai food and this is on the top of my list. Another plus is the entire staff are also nice and very accommodating. A must stop for anyone in the Las Vegas area!"}
{"text":"The best red duck curry I have ever eaten. I was expecting run of the mill Thai food when I wandered in solely because I happened to be nearby. 

Nothing really tipped it off it was going to be more until my food hit the table and I stared at it in shock.

 It looked significantly better than any red curry I have ever been served. Then it 100% lived up to that on taste.

They don't have many tables. Like they said in the movie Jaws \" You're gonna need a bigger boat\". This place is going to get swarmed."}
{"text":"They just opened. 
It has great atmosphere. 
Modern look. 
Comfortable chairs. 
Great staff. 
The BBQ was very delicate. 
The Thai ice tea just delicious."}
{"text":"My fave vegan food in Henderson!! Pad Thai is excellent and their spring rolls are so addicting. Thankful that they partner with DoorDash as well so it can be delivered! I convinced my omnivore team at work to come try this place for a team lunch, and it was nice that everyone got to eat what they wanted. We were all satisfied and enjoyed our meals. Overall, very happy with the quality!"}
{"text":"Went here with my love and it was great. The food was super good along with fast and friendly service. I will warn you though I'm a spice girl and I ordered level 8 and man! It was still super tasty but will definitely take down the number next time because I met my match finally. Highly recommend trying for vegans and non vegans. My boyfriend who isn't vegan had the vegan pad se eu and really enjoyed it. Delicious food for sure."}
{"text":"Surprisingly mediocre experience despite all the 5-star reviews on this website. The waiter was hard to understand and totally emotionless. My food was ready in, like, 4 minutes after I placed the order. Did they simply reheat the old food? Most likely ... since the mix (I would not call it by any other name) was barely palatable (and cold). No taste/flavor. Saggy texture. I indicated level 4/10 spiciness. It wasn't. Absolutely bland. Ask for a check. The handwritten check reads $15.14. Give them my credit card. Pay attention - this is when the most \"interesting\" thing happens ... I get a text from my bank indicating that my card was just charged $18+. Hmm. They bring back a printed receipt: it indicates the \"correct\" $15.14 amount with the \"tip\" and \"total\" lines left blank. So ... they went ahead and charged me 20% tip without ever giving me a chance to decide on the amount? I guess, based on the food quality, they decided not to take chances with me :) By the way, on a nice cool Sunday afternoon the place was deserted. Just sayin' ..."}
{"text":"Thailicious?  For sure!  Took the wife out here with the intention of ordering way too much & taking some home. Mission accomplished. 

First, the crab with cream cheese puff pastries. Nice balance of the stuffed crab & cream cheese. The sweet sauce on the side added tremendous value.  Our chicken Tom Ka Gai soup was exactly the way I like it.  Perfect amount of coconut flavor, mushrooms & some green herbs, and served at a temperature ready to eat.

Next, entrees...I always try the Pad Thai at new spots. This one looked great & tasted better. Went with shrimp, which was seasoned just right & the soft noodles cooked to perfection.  

Last, but definitely not least, the Green Curry.  I love curry & this is my new favorite.  Layers of flavors with a subtle heat that built as I ate more. Liked it so much that we ordered another with an Avacado Curry to go.  Sooooo yummy.

Finished off with the vegan cheesecake.  Never had a vegan cheesecake & gotta say, it was tasty.  Non dairy whipped cream on top, with some fruit and chocolate sauce.  Perfect sweet ending.

The portion sizes are on the larger side, and the flavors are spot on.  There were extra peppers and spices brought to the table to further season to taste, if need be.  Really though, it wasn't needed. Highly recommend enjoying some meals at this comfy spot."}
{"text":"So with all the incredible reviews, I had to go try this restaurant. Unfortunately, Thailicious was only Thaiokayish for me today. First, walking into the restaurant, the setting seemed very wrong to me, A table right by the front door and the front desk set back from it, so everyone entering is literally passing right next to your table, never mind passing it, they wait right next to you to be seated. Okay, perhaps trivial. Tables are set so close to one another you cant have a private conversion with your date. We were brought water right away, good start, orders taken promptly thereafter. Wife ordered Pad Thai with tofu, I ordered eggplant with chicken. But I also ordered the crispy spinach appetizer. So my wife's plate shows up around 10 minutes later and she is waiting for mine before she starts. I encourage her to enjoy it while its still hot, she noticed it didn't come with crushed peanuts as its suppose to. Another 5 minutes pass by before she could ask for them. My meal finally arrives. So for flavor of food I'll give it 4 stars but service is low 3. So now we have our meals and half way through them, my appetizer shows up. Personally, I should have said take it back. Appetizer is pre meal. The crispy spinach taste good but it was extremely oily. I understand this restaurant is new but prioritizing things shouldn't be so difficult. I'm willing to try it again and see if things get better. Overall, Id say the food is pretty good."}
{"text":"It's good to have a decent Thai restaurant in Henderson. The place was very clean and the service was good. I got a soup with some shrimp in it (I forgot the name) and it was fairly good. I also got the green curry with chicken. Although the curry was very good, the chicken was too dry. I will give them another try since there were many things to try on their menu and the service was agood."}
{"text":"If your searching for true Thai cuisine do not go here. I was recommended by a friend and got beef Mongolian which I ordered a level 3 spice level which was basically ordering a 0 spice level. There was hardly any beef just onions and peppers , and the beef I got was fatty. My dad got the Duck Pad Kra Pao which did not look or taste like duck meat with mostly a lot vegetables again, my mom got the House BBQ chicken which she States was just \"ok\" . There are many delicious Thai places in Las Vegas and Henderson, this just was not one of them sadly."}
{"text":"The best thai food ever. We were on our way back from vegas, best vegetarian options and food as well. We were on our way from Hoover dam stopped by for lunch friendly service and also awesome food highly recommend thus place if you are vegetarian and love Thai food."}
{"text":"highly recommended for lunch and dinner, good food and quick service, very attentive and on top of things. good if your looking for a quick place to grab a bite !"}
{"text":"My goal is to try everything here. Unfortunately when I try something new it becomes my favorite. I really appreciate the efforts of the cooks and staff to make their restaurant a #1...seafood dishes are always my favorite..."}
{"text":"PROS: 
1. Close to home and EOS gym
2. A brand new restaurant 
3. Clean interior design 
4. Great food, offers vegan entrées 
5. Great customer service 
6. Reasonable prices 

CON:
1. Too close to home & the gym

Try it for yourself."}
{"text":"Great Thai food. Tried various dishes and loved them all. Very clean restaurant and we had fantastic service. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"This place is great, and I'm so glad they are down the street. What I can't rave about more is the service. I only ordered take out, but I was asked by two separate people if I needed water while I waited. I ordered for my family, who all enjoy varies spice levels, and they hit every point. Ordered the cashew chicken level one and it still had great flavor, and no heat. Beef pad see ew a level four and it had slight heat. I ordered my yellow curry a level nine. I am used to most Thai restaurants really holding back on the spice and usually order pretty spicy because of it, but this curry is HOT. I feel like for once I finally got a spice level I actually ordered. The restaurant is clean with modern furnishings. The staff is wonderful. The food is great. Def a must stop for Thai food in Henderson."}
{"text":"Really flavorful authentic Thai cuisine. Excellent service. Great value. Will be coming back."}
{"text":"If you like very good Thai and reasonable prices this is the place.   It's always consistently good.  Staff very friendly.  Can be very busy at lunch between 12-1 but the wait isn't too long then either.  Place is clean.     They should add just a few more tables in one open spot.  Bet they would keep that filled too!   

Try the pynang curry it's simply wonderful.   But even adding no spice be careful it starts at kinda hot like a 3 already."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Everything we ordered tasted great. Hard to find vegan options so this place was a relief and so close to our home.  Will definitely be back. Highly recommend. Great service, lovely decor, clean and delicious."}
{"text":"Yummy food and good service! All of the workers were attentive and friendly. It is obvious they were trained well in customer service. All dishes I saw were served in generous portions"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! The restaurant is very clean and relaxed. A very nice place to sit at... My fiance and I ordered off the vegan menu, orange \"chicken\" and crispy garlic \"chicken, and we absolutely loved it. We also gave some to our 15 month old daughter and she was loving it as well! The Thai tea is very tasty and vegan friendly. Also the owner is a very sweet man and talked with us while we were waiting for our food! Very happy we found this place! I definitely recommend this place for everyone since they serve both vegan and nonvegan thai food!"}
{"text":"Just left Thailicious, it was delicious!  Many options to choose from, clean, ambiance, big portions, fresh and hot both in temperature and spice~we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Tom yum soup was delicious, and the Pad Thai just right not too sweet and not greasy like some places.  Very friendly staff will defiantly be back."}
{"text":"Long wait but the food was excellent and they offer vegan choices and green Thai green which was supreme. Their takeout is generous in portion size too."}
{"text":"Awesome THAILICIOUS food! Very nice decor and atmosphere as well. The drunken noodles are to die for."}
{"text":"This is my most favorite Thai restaurant ever! I've been there a few times and the staff is so friendly! It's super clean and they do have vegan options! I usually get the panang or the avocado curry! Both super delicious. The menu prices are super affordable and I will definitely keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our food and service again. It's always nice to be recognized as a local and welcomed back. This place gets busy and it comes in waves. We were lucky enough to get one of the last tables. Our food came out a little staggered this time. But they were super busy and likely filled about 15 to go orders in the time we were sitting there. The staff is always attentive as well so we didn't even notice the food took a few minutes longer then usual. We were also lucky enough to try a new desert item... vegan cheesecake! What a an unexpected treat. We all really liked it. This visit we brought our non vegan friend with us. He loved his dishes. He tried the avo green curry vegan style and the thailiscious rice with chicken. But his favorite might have been the vegan orange soy chicken. He will be back and of course I'll be back!"}
{"text":"First time here and it was absolutely delicious! The Chicken Pinang curry and the shrimp summer rolls were amazing! The staff was very friendly as well! Quick with service! It's nice to have a Thai place close by. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I really don't like giving less than four stars for a restaurant that hasn't done anything horribly wrong in particular. Unfortunately I have to this time for reasons I'll explain shortly. The service was pretty good, the girl who helped us was super sweet and accommodating. The place itself is very beautiful on the inside and very comfy. The food is very authentic with the exception of one thing: spice level. Maybe I've been spoiled by all the delicious Thai and south East Asian restaurants in California, but i expect a 6 level spice to be a 6 and not a 1. I'll give them some credit for not assuming I can't handle spice and not asking me what level I want and just giving me whatever. She asked me what level for papaya salad, and I said 6 worrying that it would be too hot since Thai usually runs hot. I had to ask for a spice cart and dumped everything into the papaya salad. My mom had curry spice level 8, and it was more like a 2. Disappointing to say the least, just didn't seem right to me. Papaya salad has always been known to be spicy and this just didn't cut it. At least they used actual Thai spice rather than cayenne pepper like some other Thai places here. 
This place is much better flavor wise than most hendertucky Thai places, but still doesn't cut it for spice level for me. I might give this place a second chance in the future, but I am going to ask for a 10 and if it comes level 1 I'm just going to be doubly disappointed."}
{"text":"I really wanted to try this place but I didn't even get to order. Sadly they left us sitting at our table for over fifteen minutes. One girl finally came by, poured waters and left. Tried several times to make eye contact with the servers, no luck so we left. Glad they have vegan options, wish the service were better."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!! Fresh ingredients, amazing food, loved it and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent.

Coming into the restaurant, you're met with a dimly lit atmosphere and friendly servers. Water was refilled at an amazing rate and the servers were very professional. They also have a vegan option, so come thru vegan friends.

Now to the food. We started with the crab wontons. Crunchy on the outside, smooth and creamy on the inside. A delicious start to the meal. The next thing we ordered was the papaya salad. The vegetables were fresh and imparted a crunchy texture. Combined with the sweetness, acid, and spiciness of the dressing, the papaya salad was very nice. The shrimp on the salad was perfectly cooked. A lot of places tend to overcook their shrimp. The chef in this place does not overcook his shrimp!!! Next was the panang curry. I look for sweetness, creaminess, spice, and overall aroma. With the aroma, the basil, garlic, chili, and coconut aromas are well complimented by the spices. The little dab of coconut milk in the middle was a nice touch. It added more coolness to the dish and it attributed to the overall visual appeal. Next was the pad thai, it was sweet and the noodles had a really nice texture; springy but just soft enough. The last thing we ordered was the mango sticky rice. Pretty sure mangos are out of season, but I'm a sucker for sticky rice. The sweetness blended well with the tanginess of the mango. 

Food was like a movie. Eat here guys."}
{"text":"Ordered combination chowmien, drunken noodles and thailicious brown rice. My combination chowmien has no meat at all. Ill never order to go on this place ever again."}
{"text":"By far the best Thai restaurant I've been to. I've been to many Thai restaurants in Las Vegas, but this one has to be my favorite. To start off, the atmosphere and aura of the place was amazing. Very modern, hip, clean, and aesthetically pleasing --- but what tied it all together, despite how modern it is, were the authentic decorations that represented Thailand as a whole. Next, is the customer service. They were quick to greet me with a smile. Although there have been times where it was extremely busy, they always manage to offer me water, or reassure me that my table/waiting time will soon come to a shorten length. You can definitely tell that the owners are very involved in the restaurant because they have been there every time I have came. They don't  just make small talk with their customers, they make them feel like family. Lastly, comes the food. They amazed me with their dishes and appetizers. As you can tell from the pictures, it was definitely hard to just pick one appetizer. I tried the beef green curry on this night as well. The curries are beyond amazing and the beef pad se ew is also a favorite of mine. Their beef is very marinated and tender! My guests loved it here, as it was there first time. Their food has actually had me question if I should go vegan  their vegan options are amazing, I might just have to convert! From the setting, to the service, to the food --- Thailicious has become my #1 Thai food restaurant! I highly recommend trying it. Driving across town for it is most definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Ordered yellow curry with chicken, beef pad se ew and shrimp pad Thai from their lunch menu. So Thai-licious, everything was to 'thai' for! Yum. Service was great too."}
{"text":"I never was a huge fan of Thai food until i went here. The food is delicious they offer vegan options and the service and speed was great. Me and my husband have to come here at least 4 times a month now. Your taste buds will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Curry is so bomb! Loved the vegan options, and it's perfect for a quick meal coming in or out of Las Vegas. It will be my new spot for sure!"}
{"text":"Favorite place for lunch these days! Their lunch special has a great variety. Their lunch specials come with a choice of soup (my favorite ) or salad. The peanut sauce with the salad is amazing! They add an egg roll with your lunch specials! I love that they offer vegan options here as well! Their vegan beef jerky is a must try! Service is always on point. They are constantly refilling waters and asking how we are doing."}
{"text":"I just dined here for he first time and based on the lunch value alone, I'm giving it five stars.  Soup or salad, Huge portion of phad Thai and a spring roll.  Total with tax, $7.57.  Amazing.   The food was served fast and fresh.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Phenomenal new Thai spot. Incredibly exquisite flavors will leave you filled and still with your mouth watering. Extensive selections with a wide array of options even a whole vegan menu. Thai roti is not often found on a menu- this is the real deal. Modern comfortable atmosphere with great service. This is an awesome addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and awesome service! It is not easy to find a good vegan place, but all I can say is that this is one of the best vegan places I've tried. The tom yum veggie is a perfect blend of hot and spicy broth that will light up your taste buds and the soy thai beef jerky is to die for!"}
{"text":"I'm Thai by blood, so when a restaurant advertises that they are authentic, I would know what that really means.  I'm pleased to report that almost everything we ordered was indeed not only authentic but also delicious!  The only reasons they lose a star are: 1) The Pad Seeuw had regular broccoli in it.  Chinese broccoli would've been truly authentic and tasted better.  Perhaps I could've requested it, I don't know, but I shouldn't have to.  2) The seats are uncomfortable.  They were all either wooden bench-like seating or metal chairs, all without cushions."}
{"text":"I had the crab fried rice and it was really good it wasn't heavy and it tasted light and clean and tasty. The eggrolls were lukewarm and not very good. I had the scallop green curry and they were baby scallops. Which was completely unexpected and if you know anything about baby scallops - they're not tasty. You could've got away with three or four big scallops and the sauce and it would've been divine. The sauce/Curry is good and the heat was good as well. My husband got the Kung Pow and it was really small portion. Mostly onion very little bell pepper. Would never order that again. 

I would come again to try something else. The noodle dishes are larger portions."}
{"text":"A surprisingly excellent Thai restaurant in Henderson Nevada. Who knew? 
Great flavor, good quality, and everything is well presented at decent prices. 
Friendly staff match the warm ambience. Love the bonus purple flowers on my appetizer plate to spiff up the presentation as well. What an exclamation point!"}
{"text":"The prices are portions are decent, but the food is kinda bland. My pad se ew tasted more like peanut oil than anything, if they upped the flavor I'd give them 4 or 5 stars."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Vegas! I would have given 5 stars , however it takes too long to be seated due to the popularity of this place. I don't think the owner thought it would be such a hit so quick or else they would have picked a more accommodating location."}
{"text":"Very good.......Ocha is my fav in downtown las vegas and
Thailicious is my favin Henderson"}
{"text":"This lady is really starting to love Thai food!  I am certainly not the expert on what is authentic and what is not.  What I do know is I enjoyed their dishes very much.  

Located on the NW corner of Stephanie & Paseo Verde, it was easy to pop in for a To-go order.  I was able to try the Pineapple Fried Rice & the Pad Se Ew with beef.  The fried rice was such a large portion.  It's made with curry seasoning which I love.  It's combined with shrimp, chicken, onion, tomatoes, cashews and pineapple.  I wish I knew they topped it with cilantro.  Luckily it was easy to pick off.  Next time I will ask to leave that off.  

The Pad Se -Ew with beef was delicious!  The dish consists of flat rice noodles with egg and broccoli in a soy sauce. When initially ordering, the lady asked what spice level I wanted.  I told her 7 but she looked at me like I was crazy.  She thought putting the spice on the side so we could add what we wanted was a better option.  Now this has happened at other Thai restaurants so you'd think I would be used to it.  I certainly spiced it up at home with the small container they included. Nonetheless, I would order this dish again!

There were a few little snafus but that won't stop me from coming back."}
{"text":"My new Thai spot! I got their lunch special w vegan yellow curry which also came with a spring roll and a salad. It was delicious and I only paid almost $8 too!"}
{"text":"Real happy they offer their Thai dishes both traditional way and vegan versions of it. 

Super happy they're located right by the EOS Fitness gym I go to. Nice there's more healthier options again. 

Everything we order has been delicious! My faves the Crispy Eggplant, Crispy Spinach, the Tom Kha Veggie Soup, Paradise Salad. Just love how the flavors pop out on all their dishes. 

Five stars for having an awesome, delicious and affordable 6.99 special during the lunch hours. Good variety of entrees offered and generous portions. Word of mouth has spread fast and it's super busy during these times but quick turnaround, and haven't had to wait to be seated.

Inviting ambiance. Natural lighting. Spacious dining area has clean modern look. 

It's primarily table service style restaurant, so wait to be seated and 
pay at end of your meal. 

Service is great now! In the beginning they were overwhelmed, slow and orders were forgotten, but forgivable, being it was during the first week, but the staff has been very welcoming, efficient, and always smiling. They know their regulars. So much so, they have my favorite drink, Butterfly Pea Lemongrass juice out to my table as soon as we're seated.

Love this neighborhood restaurant! Thailicious just rocks all around!"}
{"text":"Stopped in with my wife tonight for first time based on Yelp reviews.  Glad We did!  Great food, great service, reasonable prices.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Great menu for vegans and carnivores alike. I've dined in and taken out with equally good experiences. The food is delicious and the service is quick. Their curries (vegan and with meat) are consistently rich and the portion sizes are generous."}
{"text":"This establishment is absolutely great. The food is delicious and the flavorful way that the food is made is rich and decadent. The place is very clean and well kept. It's simple and yet enticing. 
Dutch, the gentleman who owns the place was there to personally take care of us and he did a great job with the impression that he gave us with his place. 
We came here today based on Yelp reviews and after frustrating visit at Whole Foods. It was a switch worth made by us. 
We will definitely visit again and try the other dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"We LOVE Thailicious! Great menu for all eaters, especially us vegans!!! My fave is the avocado curry and the kids love veggie pho! Thanks for offering up some plant based fare!!! You guys rock!!!"}
{"text":"I live in the Northwest part of town but I was craving GOOD vegan Thai food and Thailicious did NOT disappoint! It was absolutely delicious and totally worth the drive!! I will absolutely be making the drive all the way to what feels like \"the other end of the Earth\" for their food again because it's more than worth it! Thank you for offering delicious food and for offering compassionate, vegan options!"}
{"text":"Delicious Thai with Vegan options, best pad thai and the soup was delicious, lunch specials are under ten bucks so why go anywhere else?  No beer and wine though.  Not quite five star, service however I will upgrade depending on the next visit."}
{"text":"If its not the food then its the atmosphere. I wanted to take all the furniture in this place. I have been to alot of thai places before but this place has some good flavors. The tom yum soup was spiced to perfection and the drunken noodles was a drunken master. It wasn't as oily like some places.

I would definitely bring more friends next time so they can get a taste of Thailand."}
{"text":"Tried this place as we were just down the street!! Amazing!! Food is delicious! Staff are incredibly friendly and accommodating! We will be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy about this place. The food is awesome and I haven't found anywhere in Henderson for good Thai until now. 

The green curry was so good I find myself craving it and I am usually a yellow curry person. Ordered it after reading reviews! Pad see yew was excellent. Had both types spring rolls, crab Rangoon, and veg fried rice... all totally delicious. This place doesn't disappoint, I encourage you to decide on this place and not any other in Henderson. Other places always disappointed me. I'm excited to get to try other stuff on menu but I usually order same stuff because I like so much! Staff incredibly nice as well."}
{"text":"This Thai  restaurant is our new favorite. 
Butterfly  tea lemongrass that turns purple when you squeeze a lemon in it. 
Appetizer- Fresh  shrimp spring rolls & vegan crispy spinach. 
Dinner- Won Ton soup & Green curry with chicken."}
{"text":"This place is great!  I come here all of the time.  The servers are very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"This is definitely the best Thai food I have ever tasted. The food is very authentic and feels like your eating in Thailand, until you step back out into the Las Vegas sun. The Thai Beef Jerky is my favorite!! Must try the Papaya Salad, Duck Pad Kra Paow, Pad see ew, Fried Egg plant and Fried Tofu(pictures attached). Dutch and Jaidah are customer service experts."}
{"text":"Thailicious is one of those spots that is totally deserving of the name, it lives up to it and then some! Although it's a significant drive across the valley for me, I made the trek to have lunch with a friend for their vegan specialities. The entire menu is expansive, but the lunch menu is a good sampling of what they offer. The pricing, portion, and speed of service allow you to pop in here for a quick working lunch on a weekday, too.

I had to start with the fried spinach appetizer- a similar dish is served at another great spot in town, but priced nearly twice as high. I found Thailicious' version to be comparable in both portion size and quality. That dressing they use is great! The vegan pad thai, available with either fried or sauteed tofu, was a large portion packed with noodles and veggies. The starter soup and spring roll were well-made and flavorful, too. I sampled my friend's beef pad thai and the meat was tender and well-prepared. I'm looking forward to my next work trip across town so I can order the vegan khao soi next time!"}
{"text":"This is seriously the best Thai food in Las Vegas. It's a must go!  The prices are reasonable also!"}
{"text":"I must admit that I have yet to find a better Thai restaurant than Komol. I'm a little biased as that's the Thai food that I grew up with and always prefer. But I was pleasantly surprised to see that Dutch (the owner of Komol's nephew) opened up his own place and I knew that with his experience with his uncle it had to be good. It wasn't just good, it was probably the best Thai food I've ever had. The vegan menu is incredible and the flavors were on point! We ordered several vegan appetizers, a salad and a curry. The butterfly pea lemongrass juice was a new and exciting drink for me and I'm already craving more. Hoping for lots of success with the new spot. A must eat if you're in Las Vegas/Henderson. If I could give them more stars I would."}
{"text":"Husband chose this place for me to get take out from on way home and I was surprised because he never eats Thai. He saw some pics and reviews on Yelp and suggested it. I thought it was going to be like all the other asian places in town but was so pleasantly surprised with everything I needed to write a review. Pick-up was fast and easy which is super important to me. So nice they had two registers because a lot of people were picking up things. They said 20 minutes to pick up when I placed order. I got there about 15 min after placing my order, so I was a little early, but I paid and my food was ready right when I was done. Points for being on time. :) Everything was so fast and efficient. Most of all after I got home all our food was delish and fresh. My husband loved the chicken satay and my beef and broccoli was probably the best I've ever had. Super great flavor, perfectly cooked broccoli, good quality pieces of beef (not all gristly or weird like they can be sometimes) and the sauce wasn't all thick or sugary. My Tom Yum Veggie had tons of veggies and spicing was right on. Glad we found this place and looking forward to trying their other items soon!"}
{"text":"Went here because of the reviews and was extremely underwhelmed.  When we arrived there was a wait to get a table which is usually a good sign and we were more than happy to wait the less than 10 minutes to get a table.  Once we sat is when I started to get worried about how the night was going to go.  I watched one of the servers clearing a table by sticking his fingers inside the previous tables glassware and take them to the bus tub which was on a cart in view of the dining room.  He then walked to our table with a pad of paper to take our order without washing his hands.  Not following guidelines set by the health district became a common theme for the rest of the short period we were there.  Another server ringing an order in walked away from the computer towards the kitchen openly coughing and not even attempting to cover his mouth.

The server trying to take our food order never welcomed us, just walked up to the table and said \"ready to order\", I don't understand why formalities are skipped in some restaurants.  So I just ordered a Thai iced tea which I watched him make thru the server entrance of the kitchen and still no washing of hands but he did continuously wipe his hands on his pants.  He also brought lemons which my guest asked for and I said he shouldn't use unless he wanted whatever cold virus the previous table might of had from the glassware that the server stuck his fingers in.  Before the server comes back with our Thai iced tea and lemons another servers walks over and says ready to order and is very annoyed when we ask a few questions.  We asked her opinion and she would shrug her shoulders and say she had no idea, with this we knew we would have to guide our own way thru their large menu.  We ordered crispy eggplant then asked some other questions about other starters and again felt as tho we were taking to long and annoying her.  We ordered the rest quickly, she never asked spicy level but I stated again which we wanted first and then the entrees after the starters. 

Within in minutes the server that had yet to wash his hands while continuing to bus tables and deliver food, delivered the crispy eggplant which lacked salt, barely any sauce and there wasn't anything crispy about them.  The staff also called them eggplant chips when dropped off so not sure if there was a different option on the menu that our server sent or not.  Half way thru our \"chips\" the hot pot of Tom kha soup arrived which she set the pot down and the stacked soup cups and spoons down, lit the hot pot and walked off.  She didn't say a thing, there was no \"give this a minute until it's nice and hot\" or \"I'll be back to ladle some out for you\".  I suggested to my guest that we wait a minute for it to start bubbling or at least steam coming from it.  Our server then delivered our entrees and I said that was too fast, we hadn't even finished our \"chips\", she said yeah there was a large party so the kitchen needed to get the food out.  First of all there was only 4 people of this large party that had arrived at this point so they hadn't even ordered and second why does my dining experience have to change due to a partially arrived large party that had yet to order. 
 
At this point we were going to just quickly eat and leave and check it off as a place to never dine at again.  The two dishes we order, red curry and drunken noodles, were ok so it shows me that the food is the saving grace of the dirty handed service staff that is severely lacking.  Our burning hot pot of soup however was warm at best and the vegetables were raw so I flagged the manager over and told him.  He said sorry and said he would take it off our bill, never suggested to send a hot one nor did he ask how everything was.  No one asked how anything was and we even had our plates taken away when they still had some food on it by the server that had yet to wash his hands.  We were over it and just went to the register to pay and when asking for receipt were given the wrong receipt.  On that receipt we noticed how those guests were offered different levels of spice.  On the way back home which is on the other side of town my guest said to me \"what a waste of time that was\" and that's why I am spending my time writing this review."}
{"text":"This place is usually pretty amazing. Never disappointed with the food. I grew up eating Thai food though and they're food is good but it's really not that special. 

I always try to do take out when I eat there cause it's almost always full around dinner time. They almost always give me the wrong food in my order and they always say \"it'll be ready in 20 minutes\" when really your looking at an hour wait. 

If you want a real Chinese/Thai experience with truly special tasting food, I would recommend taking a trip into Asiatown and find a place called King Fu. Doesn't get better than that."}
{"text":"Great food, awesome vegan options.............,. Friendly staff........... Always busy.............look forward to coming back soon.............!!"}
{"text":"I live across town and made the trek to the grand opening. It was a little busy, although the service was great and the food was amazing. I got my free Thai tea, plus ordered the Beef Salad and I was completely satisfied with my dish . Im coming back here for sure. Five stars!"}
{"text":"I was really excited for this place to open up, as I had been a fan of Komol for years.
The first time I came here the service was really bad, a few of the staff didn't speak very good English and they were confused on basic requests of mine like asking for a glass of water. English is my second language as well, so I am certainly not faulting anyone for not speaking the language. But if your job is to take food orders, I do think it is pretty important that you understand the language. Ordering was very difficult. 
Food came out warm not hot, and the taste was mediocre.
Second time I came here the service was much better, the food was still just mediocre at best. 
I know it's the same recipes as the older's uncle's restaurant but for some reason I liked the other place much better. Maybe this place is just too trendy for me and not warm or inviting enough. I guess it just doesn't feel that comfortable inside, maybe it's the seats, maybe it's the vibe itself. I just know what I have been to plenty of amazing Thai restaurant over the years and had a great meal. Both times that I've dined here I have not felt that way. 
The environment feels kind of sterile. 
And with the food just being mediocre at the pricing not being particularly great or different than any other Thai restaurant, I see no reason why I would choose to come here over any other place. Sorry, thailicious, you just haven't won me or my family over."}
{"text":"This review is just for last night dinner we had. Do note that previous visits deserved 5 stars. Last night we arrived around 8:00 PM and we were party of 7 and I think that is what must be wrong. Unfortunately for us, we came with some guests to whom we had build up this restaurant as best food around our area. Let me start with something not so important, most of the food came out not so much decorated as it usually is. It was all thrown up in a dish and served. Now the real bad part, 2 rice dish that we ordered were barely warm instead of hot. Pineapple fried rice that we ordered as 4 were clearly more spicy than other rice that we ordered 7. It clearly looked like they just served us what was left over in the day. I have eaten Roti before at the same place and last night a waffle like Roti was served. When I commented to the server what the hack was that he replied, it is now done this way to save time but has the same ingredients. Not sure you can call yourself \"Authentic Thai\" if you are going to make Roti in waffle maker. Very unfortunate to see a really good restaurant going down the drain. May be it was just one off but I will not be visiting them in the near future. May be some day once there are enough good reviews or may be stick to it for lunch."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant and I will definitely continue coming. The quality of the food is . The employees are friendly and provide great customer service. I'm a vegetarian and was excited to see a place that I could eat at without having to substitute my order. I tried the Paradise Salad, Pineapple fried rice and soy Thai beef jerky"}
{"text":"This place is so good! Went here on a Saturday night and it was pretty busy along with people coming in & out for take out orders. They ask you on a scale from 1-10 how spicy you want your food. We got a 4. If you're a whimp when it comes to spicy food (like me!!!) you might want to go a little lower because they like their spice! We ordered the papaya salad, pad thai, and red curry and all were delicious & the portions are huge! We will definitely be back! Inside the restaurant, seating is a little bit limited but it's clean and tastefully decorated. I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I am so glad this place exists!  Finally, some new blood and variety in the Henderson food arena!  I am by no means vegan and I am not the biggest fan of Thai food but I sure do love places that are nice, close, cheapish, and new so I had to try it.  Went with my mother and we adored the placce.  It was super clean and well decorated although quite simple.  The staff were very friendly and we were seated right quickly.  The food smelled amazing and I began salivating as soon as I sat down.  I ordered the Drunken pork noodles and my mother got the beef pad thai, both of which were very tasty.  I got mine with a 6/10 spiciness and that was just right although when I go back (because I definitely will) I will order a 7/10.  I really want to try the curries and honestly most things on the menu.  I'm actually kind of excited typing this even though I just went only a few hours ago.  Go and try this place and keep going back so we can keep good, family run, unique dining options open and available in Henderson!"}
{"text":"My go to Thai place. The food and service is always consistent - GREAT! I've never really been a fan of Tom Yum soup until I had theirs....sooo good! The chicken green curry is a fave and the drunken noodle is delish. Highly recommend if you want classic, high quality Thai food"}
{"text":"The food was amazing. I was really surprised did not expect to find great Thai food in Henderson. Highly recommend, will definitely enjoy this food on my future visits"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed their Tom kha with shrimp and pad thai with chicken. Also ordered the red curry beef and that was OK too.. Service was fast servers were nice!"}
{"text":"Really good tasting food, nice comfortable atmosphere and prompt friendly service. You'll likely have a pleasant and tasty meal experience here.

We dropped by on a Tuesday evening for dinner. Not too busy, so we were seated quickly.

We enjoyed some tasty Chicken Satay, Duck Noodle Soup, Rad Na and Mango with Sticky Rice. Everything was nicely prepared and flavorful.

The prices offer a good value for their tasty food."}
{"text":"One of my favorite new spots. The food is delicious and they even offer a decent amount of vegan and vegetarian options too. I've tried almost everything on the menu and it's always good. The service can be a little disorganized sometimes but the quality of the food and presentation make up for it. This is my go to spot."}
{"text":"Met a friend for lunch. Service was GREAT!  Food was delicious. I had chicken pad Thai and friend had green curry. We were very happy with both and the portions were pretty big. I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"On a wimb i went and tried this place out, i came in by myself and had a nice little dinner. The food is delicious but i wasent checked on the whole time i was there, might be part of the culture. But the beef jerkey is bomb to start off with!!"}
{"text":"I have tried this place twice now and have to say I couldn't be more disappointed. First time I dined in and the service was slow, unfriendly, staff was not knowledgeable and didn't get our order right. 

Tonight I gave them another shot via take out and the order was not what we ordered. Dishes that were not supposed to be spicy were on fire and dishes that were supposed to be spicy had zero spice.  I will not be coming back again."}
{"text":"Amazing Thai food restaurent ! Everything is perfect, price are very good, Top quality ! It's a must go place !

A+

We will comeback for sure !"}
{"text":"After 3 days in the Las Vegas area piecing together vegan meals, this place was a dream. Delicious food, very reasonably priced and great service."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!!!

YES, food is pretty good, but all dishes and glasses have food particles. We asked for new water glasses and they too were dirty. Our food plates also had many dry food particles, which you could easily see and touch.

Management: if you're reading this, then please fix and clean our your dishwasher or whatever you are using to clean plates. Until then we will never come back."}
{"text":"So a friend took me here and it was delicious! Everything fresh and tasty, a good place for vegans if you still want to get your thai fix. We had pad thai, garlic fried rice, soy jerky (bomb), and tofu satay. Sooo good I cannot right now lol. Also try their thai green tea, so refreshing. Love love love, definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"My co-workers put in an order and asked that I pick it up so this was my first experience with this restaurant. It was busy inside which I always feel is a good thing if there are many people dining in. I love chicken pad thai and this is delicious. I have a spice level 5 which is not spicy but gives just a bit of a kick. The spring roll is good, not the best I have had but still very tasty. This place is close to my job so I will be a frequent flyer now that I have found them."}
{"text":"I came across this place on Yelp while looking for a different place to eat yesterday with the wife.  Reviews were good and it was relatively close to home.  After work we stopped by to give it a go.  I'm glad we did.  Both the wife an me enjoy Thai food and have frequent several venues in the valley (some misses, mostly hits).  This was a definite HIT!  I enjoyed their chicken pad thai while the wife had pad wan sen.  We shared crab meat fried rice (excellent) and ended the meal sharing a serving of vanilla ice cream.  Price point and serving sizes were very generous.  The staff was friendly and very attentive (something I always look at when dining out....it often is the deal breaker for return visits).  We will definitely be back for seconds and beyond.  Thank you so much for a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food. Great atmosphere. Good service. The location is a little difficult to get to but certainly worth it."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered here was superb! Spice level for all was about 4/5. We ordered the pineapple
Shrimp Fried rice sans raisins, chicken curry, and beef pad Thai. Love the basil/curry flavor or the pineapple. Chicken curry was just delicious and perf! The pad Thai was good as well, but I'm just not a pad thai kinda girl.

I low-key almost got annoyed because me and my friends were going to be late for class. We've asked for our mango with sticky rice since mid-feasting on our meal, just so we knew it was going to come out at a safe time for us. Still, even after we were all done, the mango with sticky rice took so looong. Yes we were late for class, but you guys..... the Mango with sticky rice here was well worth it!!!

Presentation was fantastic. I don't know how or why the sticky rice was bluish/greyish tinged, but the taste was just way above delicious. Mango with sticky rice is one of those Thai dishes that taste the same everywhere, but Thailicious' version will forever stand out to me. 

Coming back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Hello folks!! Was looking for another vegan place to eat. Of course I used Yelp to find this type of restaurant. And I saw Thailicious. I decided to pick something up from them after my appointment. I walk in and it's a very nice and clean place. The people were very friendly. So so far so good and this place has quite a few good reviews. I ordered off of their vegan portion of the menu. For my vegan folks lots of choices mainly all of them have tofu. I'm sure you can request the tofu to be withheld as I don't like tofu either. But you do have quite a few choices. I chose the Vegan egg rolls and the vegan pineapple fried rice. It took about 12 minutes from the time I ordered to the time I received my food. So that wasn't that bad. paid for my food and it cost $16.22. Looking at the food it was very tasty looking. I first started with the egg rolls because those are my favorite. They were crispy on the outside and soft in the middle. They were just whatever to me.. they weren't bad and they weren't great. They were just regular egg rolls. I also ordered their pineapple fried rice. Again it wasn't bad. It just wasn't great. Maybe I'm a bit stereotypical when it comes to Thai food. I expect big bold flavors and spice to clear your nasal passage. This wasn't spicy at all and 
was just okay tasting. I feel a bit let down and Desiring Thai food because this place just didn't hit the spot. maybe they have different chefs at different times. I don't know.... my apologies Thailicious! I don't like to give low ratings. It's like being excited because of the previews for a movie and you go watch it and the only good parts were in the previews. If I could give any advice and not that you will take it as I'm no chef. I would say to pick bold flavors and spice it up. Good luck Thailicious!"}
{"text":"The best Thai food in Las Vegas ! The owner is super cool and very friendly, amazing staff and the food is amazing I really recommend everything they have there!  We are addicted to this place ! Ask for the handsome waiter there name Miew with glasses, or the cute girl with glasses."}
{"text":"Delicious!! Always looking for a good Tom Kah! And I found it  looks very clean. It's cute in here. I really appreciate a clean restaurant"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Very good. I had so much food that I took a lot of it home. Highly recommend. The place can get crowded so prepare to wait. We went on a Sunday evening & it was packed. I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Soo glad that they offer vegan food. Took my sister and she really enjoyed it. Can't wait to go back and try more of their vegan dishes. I had the vegan chowmein and it was amazing. It's been years since I've eaten chowmein since they birthday use egg noodles. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place was a really pleasant surprise! Me and my sister came to this restaurant on a SUPER hot summer day looking for something light and fragrant. We got the lunch special; I got the green curry with soy chicken  and my sister got the orange chicken with soy chicken! It was super yummy and filling! This place was really clean and the customer service was really good! I work in customer service so it's something really important to me and they did really well. This place is a 35 min drive from my house but I see myself making the drive for this! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is the best Thai in town by far. I drive all the way from Summerlin once a week. It's that good. The yellow curry is delicious. Not only is the food amazing, the staff is really nice and the place is clean and modern. It does get really busy, every day of the week, so be prepared to wait a little bit sometimes. I've got take out from here before and it's just as good and they package it really well so that's always an option. My only complaint, is when you order a soft drink, they bring out a glass with ice and a can of whatever. Certainly, not a deal breaker!"}
{"text":"Excellent vegan menu. We have not had anything that we didn't love. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for good, vegan Thai food."}
{"text":"Delicious Thai & healthy meals in Las Vegas.
Great service, clean and reasonable. Come try yourself."}
{"text":"Love love love all the vegan options!! Ordered tom yum veggie, chow Mein veggies, and a scoop of the coconut ice cream and mango sorbet!! Everything was delicious, staff was friendly as well! Was a bit busy on a Friday night but definitely worth the wait! We will be coming back soon!!!"}
{"text":"What an amazing meal my family and I just had. Behind an unassuming store front in a small strip mall is a restaurant with the best flavors and freshest ingredients. Wow! As well as I will return often!"}
{"text":"They are not ready for the modern age. The food is good had the scallops curry with heat level at a 7 was a little too spicy. Refills not provided for ice tea may want to get water early on. Suggestion be aware of what you ordered because they gave me the wrong bill first and when they wrote me up another tab they over charged me on my drink therefore I took out the price myself from the tab. Not all dessert are available."}
{"text":"I normally don't feel compelled to write reviews but wow. Seriously...wow. Thai food has never been a favorite kind of food for me because despite it being \"pretty good\" most of the time, it's never wowed me. That changed today! I've been waiting for this place to open up for the longest time and let me tell you, the wait was definitely worth it! The owners are complete sweethearts and you can tell that they took their time with the restaurant, making sure everything was top notch and put their hearts and souls into their food. 

I ordered the Duck Panang Curry and Vegan Veggie Rolls. Both were absolutely incredible and bursting with flavor. Curry is a comfort food for me and their curry was honestly, the BEST I've had out of Indian, Japanese and Thai curry. Decadent and rich, with just the right amount of coconut and spice. The vegetables were still crisp and the duck had amazing flavor and texture that complimented the vegetables and curry beautifully. Rolls were also delicious; fresh and came with a peanut and a hot and sour sauce. 

If that wasn't enough to entice you to go, their customer service is phenomenal! I was offered a water while waiting for my food, which I really appreciated. Employees made small talk and were very friendly. There's truly something for everyone here, whether you're looking for vegan and vegetarian cuisine or something with meat. Give this place a try! You will not be disappointed. I look forward to coming here frequently."}
{"text":"The restaurant was packed when we arrived around 8pm on a Saturday night. Although, this was my bf fifth time going and he said it's always busy. The service was friendly and attentive. The best part was how delicious everything tasted!!!! The entrees we ordered (drunken noodles and cashew nut) were not spicy. If you prefer your dish on the spicer side, I would recommend asking the server if the kitchen can increase the spice level. Overall, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Awesome Thai restaurant conveniently located off of 215 and Stephanie! Have been here a couple of times and forgot to write the review. 

1) Parking lot in strip mall so ample parking available always!

2) It's always packed when we come here, so it can take a little bit of time to finally get seated, but it's definitely worth the wait! 

3) Ordering food was quick, yet difficult because of their extensive menu of tons of delicious options! Servers were very helpful in recommending options.

4) We've done family style ordering and it's hard to go wrong with any dish! Cucumber salad, crab rangoons, chicken lemongrass coconut soup (all time favorite!!), chicken panang, shrimp pad prik kow, pineapple fried rice, brown rice (which has a cool purple/red tinge) have all been amazing! Different spice levels are offered, but I'd recommend going lower and adding your own spice if you're unsure of how much you can handle. Ask the food to be extra hot because it is sometimes a little at room temperature by the time you start eating it. 

5) Food came out quickly after having the order taken. The waiters were doing a good job of asking us if we needed anything. There was so much food and for reasonable prices! For 4 of us, it came out to about $40, so not bad at all, especially considering we had leftovers (leftovers are what students survive on :-P )

6) Service was great. Nice, clean place. Love the minimalistic decor and the restrooms are clean, too. Not too loud and quiet location as the strip mall has always seemed dead whenever we go, despite it having the EOS fitness there. Check out the place sooner than later because it's brand new so it's lesser known yet, but it's gonna be crazyyyy packed--more than it already is!!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place and finally got to last night. First off, got there around 5 pm on a Saturday and beat the rush by about 45 minutes. Started with the delicious papaya salad followed with Tom Yum Kai. Perfect!! Then moved on to the crispy eggplant and the Drunken Spaghetti Seafood. Only did a #5 heat and it was fantastic. Crabclaws, squid and shrimp on a mound of seasoned noodles. I wanted Angel wings but they were not available so we got the lettuce wraps. The wraps were not what we expected but they all got eaten. Dinner was finished off with chocolate cheesecake and green tea ice cream. can't wait to go back.....soon!! Did I mention how hospitable and friendly the staff was!  If not..... They are TOPS!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant has a modern and clean interior, with one TV that was showing the basketball game during my visit. 

I ordered the Pad Se Ew with chicken and spicy level 5 (out of 10). The food was pretty good, nothing \"ew\" about the pad se ew. For it being medium spicy, it was a little bit on the spicier side.

Customer service was great. My water was refilled often and I was asked if everything was okay with my order. The employees seemed to genuinely care that customers have a good experience here.

I will probably be back for their lunch special. Not too sure if I'm accurate but I think it's from 11AM to 3PM, with the entrees being $6-$7. So I guess I will pad see ew later, Thailicious!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Their lunch specials are good. Try the level 10 spicy for a great taste bud tickle."}
{"text":"The best Thai food in town.  In a town with kick-ass Thai food--this one is best!  Service is outstanding!  Food phenomenal!  Flavorful, fresh, many vegan options.  Been here a lot and am always impressed.  This time had curry, chicken fried rice, Tom yum, vegan Thai beef jerky.  Full-filled."}
{"text":"We had heard good things about this place and thought we would give it a try. It was excellent, the service was great and the food was outstanding. They have a pretty good size menu with many options such as sliced or ground meat. They also have a pretty extensive vegan menu too. The staff was very friendly and attentive. We will definitely return to try more of their amazing dishes."}
{"text":"Amazing vegan Thai food! The food came out fast and was fresh and delicious. We ordered the crispy eggplant (my favorite out of everything), the egg rolls, coconut soup, and tofu pad see ew. 
The waitress was very nice and quick with everything and service was great. 
Their was also plenty of parking and it's located in a nice area of Henderson."}
{"text":"Food and service was amazing. My water was never be empty and the serving size was perfect. Presentation is great and atmosphere is nice. Little small but the customer service is on point because of the size."}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant more than 5 stars I would. We always start with their wontons which are some of the best I've ever had and then get the red curry. The food tastes amazing and you can tell the vegetables are fresh. We have also had their BBQ chicken which is reminds me more of a curry chicken but is good nonetheless."}
{"text":"The service was quite good, as I was dining here for lunch as part of a large group. A varied selection of lunch entrees  are offered; and the shrimp with mixed vegetables tasted delicious. The Thai iced tea did not disappoint. The lunch special prices are absolutely reasonable. I would highly recommend eating here, as I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Delicious legit Thai food!! Finally found my go to Thai restaurant! Clean environment and kind service! Looks like I will be a regular!"}
{"text":"My tummy hurts, for the best reason. The vegan tofu drunken noodles were so good I couldn't stop eating them and ate too much. Got spice level 4 but would definitely kick it up to a 6 or7 next time. Also enjoyed the spring rolls and dipping sauce. Husband felt the customer service was lacking but I guess it's easy to overlook that when the foods so good."}
{"text":"So good. Great for vegans and vegetarians. Avocado green curry is on point. Sticky rice is yum. Everything is tasty."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best Drunken Noodles I have ever had~! I got Spice level 4 next time will try 7. I finished my plate. 
The fresh made Lemonade was very good! I even ordered another one to go. 
Next time, I want to try the Lemongrass drink.

Great service! Team effort!
Nice restrooms, easy parking in big strip mall lot. 

Until next time! 
*Does the drunken noodle\" you can do it all by yo self jejejejjeje"}
{"text":"Bring a party of two. The food here is delicious and they give you a good amount of it. This is probably my favorite Thai restaurant now & I'm really picky when it comes to that. I had their yellow shrimp curry, pineapple fried rice, and Springs rolls. Let me start out by saying that the curry was delicious and is now my favorite. You chose your level heat (I don't know how high it goes), but for my curry I chose a  level of six on the heat scale, so it was still spicy, but not too overwhelming to where I couldn't eat it."}
{"text":"Shout out to the owner Gray Murillo for his Grand Opening!  

I'm so glad that he opened up this restaurant! 

The place was invitingly romantic and spacious. The service was on point and they were attentive to their customers. Our waters were refilled at reasonable times. They offered vegan suggestions and dishes if you're unsure of what to order. Dutch made sure that we had a pleasant experience. 

We started off with an appetizer, crab wonton, papaya salad. And for the main dishes Pad Thai and Panang Curry. 

Everything that we ordered were aesthetically pleasing. 

The crab wontons were crispy with a lot cream cheese and a lot of love. With the papaya salad, the proportion was a lot bigger than expected. You're getting the worth for your money. Totally worth it. The shrimps that came with it were cooked just right. They made that simple dish 10x better.  

A Thai restaurant isn't a Thai restaurant without Pad Thai and some Panang Curry! The texture of the noodles were perfect and it was really saucey. It wasn't dry like other Thai places. 

For me, what brought everything together was the creaminess of the Panang curry. It had a dash of coconut milk right in the middle. And the crispness of the tofu and bell peppers went so well with the curry. 

For dessert, we had mango sticky rice. The warmness of the rice paired well with the mango. 

I highly recommend that you try this place. We are definitely coming back to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"Wow! I am impressed I didn't expect to find great Thai food in Henderson. Dutch serves delicious Thai flavors in a comfortable atmosphere I started with the crispy Spinach, deep fried spinach served with a mildly spicy sauce. Followed by a crunchy tofu salad, unfortunately I forgot the name with a supply of romaine leaves to wrap it in. Thailicious has a extensive vegan menu along with a plethora of meat dishes I will certainly return to try more of his delicious recipes."}
{"text":"Wow! This is easily my new favorite Thai restaurant! 

Food: Fist off they also have a full vegan menu which is amazing! Now I can get bomb Thai food and invite my vegan friends too! We ordered the yellow curry with shrimp and the tom yum soup with shrimp. The yellow curry was delicious, I've had yellow curry many times all over and this is in the top 3! The consistency, the flavor, the big chunks of potatoes and carrots, just everything is perfect. The Tom yum soup was also amazing, it had so much flavor and was the perfect weapon to combat an oncoming cold. We ordered it spicy but even though we were dying we couldn't stop eating haha it was so good! Last we ordered the mango and sticky rice. Just wow. Not many places know how to make the sticky rice like this place and the fact that they bring it out on a wooden with a beautiful flower just made it that much better. 

Experience: So good! Funny story, one of use accidentally spilled our soup all over ourselves and the staff ran to grab napkins and towels to help clean us up but first asking if we were ok! They even offered to replace our bowl of soup. Exceptional customer service for sure! They kept an eye on us and kept our drinks refilled at all times. The owner came and talked to us after our meal and told us a little more about the restaurant which was so sweet. 

Location: It's in the shopping center right next to the freeway and easy to find. It's a decent sized restaurant with about 10 tables if I remember correctly. Everything is nice and clean and new. 

Come check them out! I can't wait to come back with more friends."}
{"text":"Overall the place was awesome. The food was great with vegan free and gluten free options. I had the Veggie Pho soup and the red snapper. The soup came with additional spice options and I asked for a gluten free soy sauce. I enjoyed having the option to spice it up on my own. The sauce for the fish was sweet but good. 
But I enjoyed the customer service even more then the food. Everyone was awesome. There was not one employee who walked by me and didn't ask how I was doing or if my food was ok. It's not easy to find good customer service and authentic food in one location in Las Vegas. I would definitely recommend for Vegan and non vegan foodies."}
{"text":"Thailicious is a small, out of the way restaurant tucked into a strip mall. On weekends they fill up fast! The good news is that they are setup to turn tables quickly so you don't wait very long. They also do a brisk take out service. They have a sign-in sheet when you come in and wait for seating so make sure you go up to the front counter when you come in.

Onto the food. The menu is small but they have a really good selection with a lot of vegan options. This is nice because it can be hard to find a restaurant that fits everyone's dietary needs. The menu is setup to have base dishes and you customize the meat. There's a few chinese dishes on the menu as well. All the ingredients taste and look fresh. They also last in the fridge well when you take the leftovers home. Here's a tip: you can tell a restaurant is using old food if the take out goes stale/looks icky after 1 or 2 days in the fridge.

We had the yellow curry and the pad se ew. The curry's flavors were very good and the sauce is filled with potatos and carrots. The only dings that I would give them is that the potatoes are a little too large and I like a thicker gravy in the curry. 

The flat noodles in the pad se ew were fried perfectly and not greasy, as they've been in other restaurants where I've had this dish. It was slightly sweet but you can tone that down with the pepper sauces if you don't like that. If you can't tolerate really spicy food they tone the heat down without making the dishes bland and flavorless.

The only ding that I'd give them is that there are no tofu appetizers and they don't put out knives and spoons at the table settings. But these are minor grouses, we're glad we found this restaurant and will return."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and try this place out. I promise you won't be disappointed. The food is delicious and the customer service is exceptional. The decor of the restaurant is clean and simple."}
{"text":"I came in one night after studying. I don't live in the area and figured might as well give It a shot. It was a dark parking lot, but the place was bright and full of people! I wasn't expecting to see so many tables filled, but after eating some of the food, It made sense as to why...

I was greeted pretty promptly and handed some menus. They have a separate vegan menu, so this made me really excited. I ordered the papaya salad, the avocado curry, and basil fried rice at a number 8 spice to go. Everything came out delicious. I've never had an avocado curry before and It was really interesting. They are able to do the fried rice with brown rice upon request. They don't have alcohol, beer, or wine yet. 

Definitely the best Thai I've had in that area of Henderson. I'll definitely be back:)"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place yesterday with my mom and it was THAILICIOUS. lol. We got the Golden Tofu, Vegan drumsticks, Tom Yum Veggie and Som Tam (all from the Vegan menu). The Soy drumsticks were amazing. The skewer stick inside cracked me up as it resembled the bone, but my son was like \"wow...taste and looks like chicken\". Some non vegans like to troll and ask why we eat stuff that taste like meat if we don't eat meat, and the obvious answer is because we like the taste without the guilt. 
The Tom yum was great and I was skeptical because it taste like fish sauce was in there. (that's a good thing if there was no fish sauce but still tasted like it) because I was a fish sauce addict. I am more of a laos som tam type of person but since going vegan, I am still completely satisfied with this vegan version and absolutely love that they put string beans in there. I ordered shrimp pad thai for my son and he loved it as well. Can't wait to come by again and try the vegan jerky and a few other things. 
Owners- If you read this, I'm not sure if you saw my message on FB, but check into the Mushroom soysauce from asian markets, for a fish sauce substitute in case vegetarians or vegans want it instead of fish sauce. Like instead of pik nampa."}
{"text":"We found this gem of a restaurant surfing the Yelp app while visiting Vegas this week.  If you have never tried Thai food, this is about as good as it gets.
 
The location is very upscale and clean. The men's restroom was immaculate and no paper towels or wet spots on the floor around the urinals.

I have this thing about checking a business's (men's) restroom-This is an area to me that should be second only to the kitchen that should always be in order. There's was a 9.5 !!!

My family of six tried the Tom Kha soup, sticky rice, drunken noodles, Thai ice tea, Thai coffee, pineapple fried rice, Pad Thai. 

The dishes were served hot and with peanut butter dipping sauce that was sooooooo good I almost broke down and cried .Their seasoning was not too loud but made you crave for more of each bite.  I just wish I could have proposed to the chef on the spot.

The servers were very attentive and the orders were brought out promptly one after the other.  I really can't say enough about the quality of the food and service.

This is a spot absolutely not to be missed...an excellent Thai food treat!!!

We shall return"}
{"text":"First Timers!!! new and modern look Thai restaurant. Very clean and friendly staff. Service was good and it was lunch time. Spring rolls were delicious, crabmeat fried rice was  next time I want no white or yellow onions! green onions ok!!! Scallops green curry looked good and my friend said taste and heat level were spot on. dessert was mango and sticky rice.  We will be back !!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Great, friendly and fast service. Must try the vegan Thai beef jerky and curry fried rice . The flavors are amazing. 

I'm not even vegan, but I only eat off their vegan menu because it's sooo damn good. I love this place."}
{"text":"Didn't take any pics. But this place is new to Henderson. Very good, the owner greets all guest (tries too). My fave is the pangnan shrimp  extra spice which is orange curry and beef jerky. Sooo yummy. Definitely will frequent this restaurant. Location is great and atmosphere is on point. Happy customer"}
{"text":"It was good nothing to great but not bad. The menu had a good variety. The employees were nice and did a good job. The waitress got my order wrong but she was super busy so i just ate it anyway. The place is clean including the bathrooms and parking was easy. The chairs are uncomfortable."}
{"text":"The best Thai food in Las Vegas-friendly servers too.  Love the beautiful and unusual drinks-so delicious and refreshing. I would love to have one in Mts. Edge."}
{"text":"Welcome to Henderson,

The true fine Thai kitchen has arrived to our neck of the woods, small and quaint with a homie Thai feel. This place does not disappoint, big flavor from their Vegan Jerky (amazing). The chicken Curry and chicken chili/basil were short of incredible. If your in the mood for a exotic food trip, do your taste buds a flavor and try this place. The only problem is going to be that this will not be a secret for very long. 
This place is an Instant hit!
Best of luck"}
{"text":"..the 2-star review is for the last take-out order.. 
..red-snapper is a great fish.. this take-out order was butchered..
..had to go back to the restaurant to return it..
..got a refund... but NOT one word of apology.."}
{"text":"I took my wife here for her birthday Tuesday night. It is not a fancy place and does not serve alcohol, but the food is delicious. I had the drunken noodles with chicken and my wife had yellow curry. Both dishes were very good. They do a 1-10 spicy scale and they are on the spicy side compared to other Thai restaurants in town. I can't wait to return to try some other dishes. They have a large vegan menu."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! We were excited to visit it being long time Komol lovers. We had the tofu pad Thai, Penang curry and tofu summer rolls. All were great. The peanut sauce that the rolls come with should be sold by the gallon"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! Huge portions and the food is amazing!!! Get thai food yet. Went back n they were closed due to private party, also togo portions are way smaller then dine in."}
{"text":"We've lived in the Henderson area for the past 7 years. We have finally found a delicious Thai restaurant with bonus vegan options! We love Thai food but have had a hard time finding a place that we want to return too. Thailicious is it! It's a small place with not a lot of tables, but we didn't mind the wait. It was also Friday night. We kept it simple with the traditional Pad Thai and beef Panang. The vegan in our group got the yellow curry and also the Veggie Crisp Rolls. I had the Tom Kha Kung soup, which is my absolute favorite. The youngest enjoyed sweet and sour pork which I was pleasantly pleased with because the batter was light and crispy and not greasy. The sauce was also light and fresh and not too sweet. Next time we will be more adventurous with our ordering. The staff was attentive and very friendly as well. Thanks for opening so close to home!"}
{"text":"Tried this place at the recommendation of a friend since we did our own Vegan  challenge after she watched the Netflix special \"What the Health\".  I was very impressed with their Vegan options and would love to go back and try more dishes which I will very soon. Tonight I walked in and placed an order to go, the restaurant was very busy for a Wednesday night.  The decor was nice as well.  I had the veggie potstickers , Vegan pad Thai and Vegan Veggie fried rice"}
{"text":"Delicious Authentic Thai food. Large variety of authentic Thai dishes with a vegan side of the menu. Try it once and you'll be addicted. Must try's are the beef jerky, panang, papaya salad, mango sticky rice, Thai tea, pad Kra pao with egg and the seafood pad kee mao"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch last week and we were just in time for the lunch special which consisted of 8 or 9 different entree options, soup or salad and an egg roll. When our food came out, we could not stop talking about how delicious the food we were enjoying was. My coworkers have been trying to get me to try this place for a few weeks now and they were right-it was fabulous! Lots of vegan options on the menu although I had the pad see ew and my friend had the pad thai, both with chicken. Definitely recommend this place, it's going to be your new favorite Thai spot!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious!!!  The crab fried rice was full of crab.  The pad Thai was awesome and the Panang Curry was amazingly delicious.  I wished they used dark meat chicken for the curry since the white meat gets pretty dry.  I will definitely be coming back to this place.  And it looks like other people love this place also!  They were so busy when I got my food!"}
{"text":"I eat Thai ALL the time, but have struggled to find amazing Thai in the Henderson area. Look no further! I got the yellow chicken curry and with every bite I kept appreciating how excessively delicious it was! On top of that, I asked for a cucumber salad (which wasn't even on the menu) and they made one for me no problem! 5 stars."}
{"text":"A new place with a good decor and plenty of choices. I ordered green curry with imitation meat. The flavors were good. However the imitation meat tasted like tofu pieces, without meat texture. We also had roti which was buttery but holding itself well. Overall, it is a good competition to my favorite Thai restaurant in town, Galanga but needs some improvement."}
{"text":"Decent food, good service.

My gripe with the food is that now after multiple orders they lack the ability to accurately spice their food. Thai food is by nature very spicy and everything i have experienced here has been lacking and inconsistent even after order a \"hot\" on their scale. 
The other problem I have was with their takeout portion size. The first time we went we got takeout for dinner and I ended up having another dinner as a result of a small container being not even 1/4 full for pad see ew.
I will finish by saying that i had a brief conversation with a gentleman who represented himself as management at least, and after talking about my thoughts on other local Thai restaurants and he was very receptive and hopeful that Thailicious would exceed expectations. We will give them another try just because i haven't tried the tom yum yet and that will be my final judgement!"}
{"text":"This is our Go To spot for Thai food in Henderson. 

The food always tastes fresh and they have options in terms of a full menu for anyone who is Vegan.

The place is pretty small so it fills up quick and wait times can be pretty long but worth it.

Must try :

The Vegan Beef Jerky is mind blowing and you'll keep asking yourself if it really isn't beef.
Crispy Spring Rolls
Pad Thai
Pineapple Fried Rice
Thai iced tea

Service is always top notch and everyone there is very helpful."}
{"text":"Food was really good. The vegan namsod khao tod is a must try dish. Tofu was extra crispy and delicious. Quaint atmosphere. Service was a little slow."}
{"text":"Good thai restaurant for lunch in Henderson area. Their lunch specials, being only $6.99, are such good deals. Most thai restaurants in town charge $9-10 for lunch specials nowadays. You get a soup or salad and an egg roll with your lunch special. I tried their beef pad see ew. Nothing amazing, but it tasted good. Portion was generous as well. Worth to give this place a try if you happen to be in the area, but I wouldn't drive across town just for it."}
{"text":"After stopping for fuel nearby I decided to come here on a whim for lunch since it's near my house. The friendliness of the staff who greeted me were polite but lukewarm in enthusiasm. After being seated, they tended to my beverage order within seconds. The vegetable soup that came with my lunch entrée arrived shortly after my drink. The plate from the soup was chipped and the broth of the soup was bland. The Pad kra paid (with chicken) was flavorful and balanced with heat-spice, but the chicken was dry. I was disappointed that the lunch special didn't offer a choice between brown rice or white. Overall, 3 stars. I may return to try another dish."}
{"text":"My bestie & her honey moved to their new home off of Stephanie so we decided to try Thailicious, the closest Thai restaurant. Wow, all 4 of us were impressed! Not only is the space comfortable & stylish, we were greeted & seated within a few minutes on a busy Sunday night. We started with the Paradise Salad, which immediately impressed each of us. My hubby & I eat a lot of Thai food - we had never had a salad like this before. Absolutely delicious! The tom kha soup and pad see yu were gobbled up but then the green curry arrived. Best green curry I've ever had. Even my friends honey, who is not normally a lover of Thai food, gave Thailicious a big thumbs up. Good value, great service & fantastic food. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I ate lunch at this restaurant yesterday with my 17 mo th old son. I have to say the food was absolutely delicious. I don't usually like tofu, but these guys make it so good! I am vegan so when I saw that this restaurant had vegan options I had to try it out. 
The staff on the other hand was not friendly at all. No one took my order until I flagged someone down. After my food was delivered, no one came by to check on me the entire time. Thankfully I had my own water in my purse because no one refilled my water until after I received my check, and was about to leave. I asked a server for my check and she forgot so I had to sit there with my kid who was getting fussy because we had already ate and were just sitting and waiting at that point. 
The restaurant did not seem overly busy while I was there, and it seemed to be heavily staffed so I don't know why there wasn't more attentive service or pleasentness, but the food will definitely be bringing me back..... TO GO!"}
{"text":"It's 2018 so that means, out with the old and in with the new! Goodbye to the last thai place i claimed as my favorite. Thailicious made me fall in love all over again... (I'm cringing lol) 
My boyfriend and I decided to give this place a shot since he's vegan. Walking in, I already found the place very comforting and cute. The cups, table setting and the menus were pretty neat. It didn't feel like a typical casual thai food restaurant. The price was similar to every other place. Which is good! I thought it'd be more expensive because it's vegan. But asides from that, the food was delicious! I fell in love with everything I ordered. The vegan tom kha (idk if i spelt it right lol) soup was my favorite part! I have never enjoyed tom kha soup so much from the other thai places I've been too. You have to try if you're a big fan of sour soup and coconut milk! Besides that, my boyfriend and I also enjoyed their avocado curry. He didn't ask for any spice, but there was a slight kick to it! Which made it even better. Keep in mind, they also have lunch specials starting 11am until 2pm! Lunch specials are the typical pad thai, pad see ew, etc. 
What makes this place even better? The service! The staff did a pretty great job at checking up on us, recommending stuff on the menu, and making sure the food was on point!"}
{"text":"Presentation is stunning. Flower is editable but, I did not try. You will not be disappointed. I recommend reservations because it can become very busy during dinner time."}
{"text":"Only a week old and the word is out!  Food is delish!!!  Congrats and keep up the yummyliousness!!!"}
{"text":"Their food was delicious. We tried the vegan menu and got the Tom Kha soup. The flavor was amazing! My sister is a vegetarian and she enjoyed it a lot. 

We also got the drunken noodles with soy chicken. The flavor of the soy chicken was amazing. It's hard to find places with good soy chicken. This was definitely one of them. I would give 10 stars if I could.

I also got the vegan chow mein and it was delicious.  

A friend of ours got the beef and chicken pad Thai. 

We also got Thai ice teas that were made perfectly."}
{"text":"The drunken noodles are delicious. I'm not a huge fan of the Tom Yum or Tom Kha. The restaurant is pretty small and there is usually always a wait during prime dinner hours, but definitely worth the wait. I've been here several times and the food is always consistent."}
{"text":"Discovered this gem on our way back to the Strip after a trip to Hoover Dam. I'm afraid it may have ruined our favorite hometown Thai restaurant. The flavor was rich and ingredients fresh. Nice touches with orchids presented on the plates. We enjoyed won tons, Pad Thai, and Pad Se Eew. Delicious."}
{"text":"New Thai restaurant opened close to me so I had to give it a try when my son-in-law, who share my love of Thai, visited. The three of us all got different lunch specials. All very good. Good sized portions for lunch. Lots of things I want to come back and try for dinner. Wait staff was very attentive and was constantly filling my glass with water, which was very important because their spicy scale runs pretty hot. They have a 1-10 scale. My five had me sweating on the top of my bald head. Felt more like a 7 from most places. My son-in-law's 4 made him wish it was a 3, while my daughter couldn't eat her 3 wishing she ordered a 1."}
{"text":"So I'm obsessed with their vegan yellow curry & crispy veggie spring rolls! 
If your vegan I definitely suggest coming to this place half of their menu caters to vegans. 
The service is good as well. We asked for our food at a spice level that was to hot and they went and made us a new dish no question asked!"}
{"text":"This place is legit! I decided to go here one night because of all the positive reviews and I have to say I was impressed with the food and service.

I ordered the green curry at the recommendation of the worker since it is one of their popular signature dishes. The curry was delicious with a creamy texture that was packed with flavor. Nothing is more annoying than a curry that is diluted with water. Loved the veggies that added a fresh crunch factor and the beef was tasty as well. The curry wasn't spicy either so don't worry too much about that if you cannot handle spicy foods.

Overall I would recommend for you guys to check this place out if you haven't done so yet. I'd say it's on the same level as Penn's Thai House and way better than Gata. I'll be back here to try it more dishes and will update my review accordingly."}
{"text":"The soy Thai beef jerky is crazy good. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for great Thai food."}
{"text":"BEST THAI PLACE in town. I had roti, with beef masuman curry and mango sticky rice!!! Wife had the vegan tom yum soup, vegan panang, and vegan chocolate cheesecake!!! It was amazing!! We are def coming back!!"}
{"text":"Excellent the new thai restaurant in Henderson!!
 I got soy beef it so good. I feel like the real beef"}
{"text":"Need to learn delivery of orders when taken. Whatched two other tables have their food served before ours. 
Not impressive with that. Thai food is good. Just not happy with delivery service"}
{"text":"Service was slow, but the food and the friendliness of the staff made up for it!
We came on a Saturday evening and waited for several minutes for a table to be cleaned.  We perused through the menu and ordered the following:

- Vegan corn cakes w/sweet and sour dipping sauce - actual corn mixed in the flour...not a huge fan as the corn kernels kept getting stuck on my teeth
- chicken wings and sticky rice - rice was bluish, but my daughter loved it.  The wings were sweet and salty and the meat had a nice chew to it.
- Pad See Ew Beef - not as pan fried as I would have liked, but still good.
- Panang Pork Curry - the curry is not as thick as I would have liked either, but the flavor profile was there.

We wanted to order the crispy duck panang but they ran out.  We also ordered the thai iced tea and thai iced coffee, but they had to brew a new batch so we only got it half way through our meals...so that became dessert instead.

Overall, the food was better than I expected, and staff was great.  We will definitely come back to hopefully try the crispy duck panang and crabmeat fried rice."}
{"text":"Wow I really like the food and friendly staff..I give these guys 5 stars for sure.. This is my 2nd time this week. I love it.."}
{"text":"This place is really delicious with vegan options! Fresh and amazing taste!!! In the area...?....STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAILICIOUS!"}
{"text":"Just when you thought you found your best secret neighborhood Thai restaurant, Thailicious comes along to reset the table!   This hidden jewel has all of the usual Thai offerings, but the flavors are deeper, more complex and flavorful.  There are a few unique surprises, too, such as the crispy spinach starter, so light and tempting (see photo).  

We had the Tom Kha soup with shrimp and the green curry with chicken.  Both had interesting vegetable combinations.  The green curry added eggplant and zucchini in addition to the bamboo shoots and the chicken was ample and tender.  We left more than satisfied and the check was under $30.  Winner, Winner for those who live near Stephanie and the 215."}
{"text":"Excellent service fast and very friendly. Food was Delicious good prices good portions tasty and Authentic.Very Clean Restaurant also."}
{"text":"Really good food and great service too!! I'm glad I found this new place for vegan Thai food"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant.
Great food and awesome staff.
Thai hot

The menu has a great options.

Mad Dog"}
{"text":"Great Thai takeout spot ... we love the Pad Thai, Panang Curry & Pork fried rice. Our new place!"}
{"text":"I've been to Thailand twice and all I can say is this food comes close. Legit Thai food and Vegan options at good prices, great service, and nice ambience. Try it and you will understand. Personally, I recommend the green Thai tea, chicken satay, vegan Thai beef jerky, papaya salad, vegan tom yum soup, and pad kra pao."}
{"text":"Delicious vegan options, was not disappointed. Came back twice on Grand opening day. So good! Great service, owner was super friendly. Lovely atmosphere to go with great food!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum!! Wow, the veggie chow mein and veggie Tom Kha Gai coconut soup are both DELICIOUS, loaded with a healthy amount of fresh vegetables! Thailicious fo sure!!!!

The restaurant was busy on a fri night, but our to go food was ready in about 20 minutes. The chefs looked professional in the kitchen from the dining area view and the place is *clean*"}
{"text":"Very very good Thai! We went for the lunch special; $6.99 for an entree, spring roll, and soup or salad. You can't beat that price. Now, with that being said, the spring roll and salad wasn't anything special. The salad comes with two options for sauce; peanut or ginger. The peanut sauce was good, maybe a little too sweet, while the ginger sauce was the better choice.

Food - the group ordered red curry, panang curry, and pad thai. Everyone liked the flavor of their dish. The portions were very reasonable for the price!

I usually order a level 3 on the spice scale when the scale is 1-5. However, the spice scale at Thailicious is 1-10. I went a little more mild and ordered a 4. It was quite warm but not overpowering! Someone else in the party does not like heat, so they went with a 3. Nope! That was not a 3! Maybe the employee played a little prank on us, but it was warmer than the 5 that was ordered! Maybe we are all just weak, but it was very warm. Just know that the scale is warmer than all other places I have been. 

Verdict - If you like Thai, give Thailicious a try!"}
{"text":"This place was every bit as good as Komol but WAY closer to our house, which is super thrilling! Friendly staff, great good, and a pretty good size vegan menu! The decor has a homey feeling to it, and is very clean and comfortable. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I love the food here- I'm still thinking about it. Service was great & the food was pretty amazing! I love spring rolls & their sauces were the best ever for dipping, true story! The curry I got spicy level medium & it cleared my sinuses, super flavorful. The mango sticky rice was portioned perfectly & not too sweet. I loved the colors to the dishes & the quick, polite service!"}
{"text":"This place has one of the best vegan menus in Las Vegas! The owner is always there and it so friendly, and always making sure your meal is perfect. I love all the vegan choices and vegan desserts. My only wish is that they would serve alcohol."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Henderson so far! For anyone trying to start a vegan, vegetarian, plant based lifestyle, i definitely recommend trying out this restaurant. All the menu options are reasonably priced. The atmosphere in the restaurant is quite nice and they usually don't take longer than 10 minutes if you order to go. I loved their pad Thai and their curries are very good as well!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Tons of vegan options on their menu - their Tom kha is my favorite and everything I've tried here is delicious!"}
{"text":"Recently became vegan so decided to try this place out. I ordered the soy chicken drumsticks, crispy egg plant and the veggie Tom Kha to go. 

All of it was delicious!

Looking forward to trying the rest of their vegan menu."}
{"text":"I cannot get over how amazing this place is. I could probably eat here every day. 

Their vegan dishes are out of this world. I don't even know how they make their curry so flavorful without fish sauce, but they do it somehow! 

Service is quick. Staff is nice. They're almost always busy, but I guess that's what happens when you serve delicious yet healthy food."}
{"text":"I've eaten at a lot of Thai places, but this one by far has been the best! The food here is great and authentic, the people are amazingly friendly and feel like family, and the service is awesome with everyone on top of everything. 10/10 recommend to anyone!!"}
{"text":"So my friend took me out for a late lunch and I got to pick & wanted a new experience. Well...great job because we really loved our food & tried several menu items. The vibe is very cool & laid back and server was helpful with the menu and service was quick. Tried corn cakes and eggplant appetizers, our favorite being the corn cakes. Shared pad se-ew with chicken and green curry with tofu. We loved both and a spice level 5 was solid spicy right where we enjoyed it. To go we took an order of chicken fried rice which they customized since it was for a child, no problem very accommodating. We left knowing this will be our new place to take everyone we know who enjoys good Thai food. The menu is inventive and diverse and I cannot wait to try something new next visit."}
{"text":"Very nice ambiance in here. Server was attentive and I was asked if the food was good or if it was too spicy. Friendly staff. They also had the game on the single TV, which I enjoyed. I wish the portions were a LITTLE bit bigger, but I will be back for the lunch specials!"}
{"text":"Keerati aka Ben was very friendly and the food was awesome. The house sauce was amazing"}
{"text":"Small little restaurant with limited seating. We arrived early for lunch, 11:30 a.m. By noon there were no tables available. I ordered the Pork basil and my friend ordered the pad Thai. My food came out fast and it was delicious. Restaurant is clean with an open feeling. The wait staff had no personality. Sorry, they just didn't :("}
{"text":"This place does not disappoint. The service wasn't that great, but the food is AMAZING. My husband and I had the Pad Se Ew and mango sticky rice. It was fantastic."}
{"text":"New place. Food was awesome. Service was awesome. Definitely one of the best Thai restaurants in town."}
{"text":"Finally, delicious Thai vegetarian/vegan food, in Henderson! Love this new little place and it's close to home. Plus, they offer regular food for your non-Vegan family/friends, so everyone is happy. The service is helpful and pretty speedy - I was especially surprised for a Friday night. The Vegan Orange Chicken was meh, but you must try the Avocado Green Curry and Soy Thai Beef Jerky. Scrumptious! And don't forget dessert! My kiddos gobble up the Mango & Sticky Rice, I'm lucky if I bite!"}
{"text":"Bomb! So good... great vegan options. This will be my new spot. Service was fast and amazing"}
{"text":"Love this place. I am a regular a Komol (where the owner of Thailicious worked for years) and when I'm in the Henderson area I always hit up Thailicious. The Panang and Tom Ka soup are fantastic. My only criticism is to pay attention to the lighting and temperature in the restaurant. Other than that, I love this place and you'll always be able to count on me to spread the word on your little Henderson gem."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite Thai place in Vegas right now. I went here on a Sunday night dinner with my whole family and we ordered about 8 different dishes, all of which were excellent. The Thai chicken bbq, Thai beef jerky, eggplant, and catfish were probably my favorites. The mango sticky rice was also very good. The place is very clean and the service was exceptional. If there's one criticism I can give, it is that they don't have much choices in their menus compared to other Thai restaurants. Nonetheless, they have the best flavors (quality over quantity!). My family and I are definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Henderson.  Pineapple fried rice, eggplant basil chicken and shrimp Pad Thai were all delicious. Nice clean place too."}
{"text":"Best Thai food ever. Guys.... after living in Vegas for 5 years, I can confidently tell you that this is one of the best Thai restaurants in Vegas/Henderson area. The flavors and the spices are so on point! Try them out."}
{"text":"While waiting for Lotus of Siam to reopen I stumbled across Thailicious. WOW, I am so glad that I did.  I have tried most of the Thai restaurants in Vegas and to be honest the majority of them are sadly lacking.  So many have watered tasteless red curry.  I was so happy that I decided to give this place a try. The red curry is wonderful and they always get my order of tofu perfect.  The spices are amazing and the food is always fresh. Being a vegetarian I rarely find a restaurant that understands my kind. Thailicious actually has a vegan menu.  If you are a vegan or vegetarian you will not be disappointed.  

I did try LOS when it reopened but i found that their red curry just could not beat Thailicious's so I shall be sticking with the Thailicious!

Just a side note the service is excellent, too! I have never had to wait to long for a seat and the servers are always prompt and they keep an eye on our drinks.  Which means a lot to me!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!! Everything we tried (Thai beef jerky, 2 different soups, chicken pad see ew and lemongrass tea) was so delicious and full of flavor. I usually add chili to just about everything I eat but I didn't need to add anything because the flavors were so good. The restaurant itself is pretty and clean and the staff was very helpful. So excited this is close to our house, we'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Wow. Can I just say I'm usually the kind of person to stick to my one or two favorite dishes at a restaurant because I'm worried if I order something else I'll be disappointed. Well, pretty much every time I go here I try something new because everything is SO GOOD. I've never been let down.

The Pad Thai might be the best I've ever had, yellow curry is to die for, I even tried the avocado green curry and it is amazing. The orange tofu and curry fried rice are delicious too.

My husband and I love to start our meal with the vegan beef jerky, fried spring rolls or corn cakes. We always leave feeling so satisfied, and we don't feel like crap afterwards. No sick feeling from crappy low quality ingredients. I feel great after we eat. The staff is always real nice too. Honestly it's becoming my favorite restaurant in town"}
{"text":"Lots of vegan options! Since  they also serve non-vegan items, it's a great place for everyone to enjoy an authentic Thai food! It gets very crowded, long wait time,  but worth it.  Just don't expect to be seated right away.  Or call for pickup or delivery."}
{"text":"When we walked into this place, there was only one other customer, a man, who was having dinner. We were greeted in a friendly manner, and seated quickly. After looking over the menu and ordering our beverages, two other customers came in and sat near us. About 5-10 minutes later more customers arrived. Our order still had not been taken. We sat while another server tended to customers who arrived after us. Finally our server came and took our order. Our appetizer came out fairly quick and was delicious. Some time later one out of the two meals we ordered came out. After waiting for an extended period of time, and after noticing everyone that arrived AFTER us was getting their food, we asked to speak to a manager. The response we got was shocking. We were told that food is cooked in two separate parts of kitchen. Wait, What? What does that have to do with my meal not being brought out and everyone else getting THEIR food? Then another employee came out to explain \"sorry, the cook is slow\". Wait, your making excuses for bad service? That's just not acceptable. The cook is slow but everyone else that arrived after us got their food??? That's just BAD SERVICE. It's a shame because the food was good. No effort was made to rectify the problem, just excuses. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I love this place, my boyfriend and I have been coming here every week sometimes 2-3 times a week, lol. It is very new and clean. It is a small venue but I have seen it on a busy night and they accommodate everyone. I have dined in and taken out and all I can say is good quality food and excellent service. I usually order the yellow curry with chicken(spicy 8/10) or the drunken noodle(spicy 8/10). If you like spicy they definitely come full force. Usually when I go to other Thai restaurants I have to ask for the highest rating of spice because apparently they don't understand my love for spicy food but here it is the perfect amount of heat that is not unbearable. And they are very good on filling up my glass of water which is something I appreciate. And they constantly check up on me to make sure everything is okay even on a busy night. I think one of the best things about this place is that they even offer vegan dishes that taste great. My boyfriend sometimes orders the tofu Mongolian dish and I have tried it, I have to say it was very good. Every time I have order food even for takeout, it has been served extremely fast. I have caught myself being very impressed with how quick our food has come out many times. This is my new favorite restaurant and I am proud to be a satisfied customer!"}
{"text":"Delicious + Thai food = Thailicious. This is one aptly named restaurant.  

Like another thai spot in town that I am quite fond of, Thailicious has an ample menu that offers both vegan and non-vegan options. I have tried dishes off both parts of the menu and everything has been phenomenal. My personal favorites are the Paradise Salad and the Butterfly Pea Lemonade.

Located in the same plaza as EOS Gym on Stephanie, Thailicious is not large but I have never had to wait to be seated (both for weekend lunch and weekday dinners). It's very clean and decorated beautifully.  Service is extremely friendly and attentive, drinks are refilled often and an employee even went out of his way to open the door for me as I left on my last visit. 

Thailicious is much more accessible to me compared to some other places I enjoy in town... add the location to the taste of the dishes and the service received, and it's become my current favorite Thai spot in the Las Vegas area."}
{"text":"Great lunch prices ($6.99) and large portions. Only  $1.00 for hot tea and the same to add extra mushrooms. Loved everything!   Fantastic service too.  Wish it was closer to home so I could come back!"}
{"text":"Looking for vegan restaurants around me and Thailicious came up.  The environment was calm and the service was very amazing.   But what I need to rave the most about is how big a variety they had for vegan food!!  I tried the garden vegetable tofu.   It was made perfectly.  It wasn't salty at all and had a wonderful array of vegetables with it!   I will definitely be going back to try more plus it's only 1 mile away from my work!   Great lunch spot!"}
{"text":"I Always order the curry powder fried rice from
The vegan menu and it is everything! We get it delivered to the salon I work at frequently and they are always prompt and delicious! Great place for Thai food!"}
{"text":"A restaurant that offers excellent Thai dishes and options for my Vegan/Vegetarian/Flexitarian/Pescatarian, etc friends?..fantastic..

Service: From my visits, youre greeted immediately upon entry and seated quickly.  One server was assigned to me but others followed up with me on keeping the drinks fresh and to ensure my dishes were fine.  They have an extensive menu that's smartly divided into Vegan and Non-Vegan and I was asked if I had any questions which I appreciate.

Thai Food:  Here are my current favorites that I'll build on as I visit more.  The Tom Yum Kai Soup was loaded with chicken and mushrooms.  The broth was the perfect amount of sour.  Pad Thai with chicken at a number 6 (out of 10) spicy.  This might have been the tastiest Chicken Pad Thai I've had for 2017.  Noodles were fresh and the spiciness was perfect to the point where it wasn't uncomfortable to chew yet I was sweating.  Well done, and I'm moving to a 7 on the spiciness scale just to see what happens. =)

Ambiance:  This place is currently very popular with limited seating so it might be best to call for reservations during prime times especially with a party of 4+.  Nicely decorated with Thai influnced decorations and Murals on the wall. A flat screen TV is usually showing sporting events or the news.  Dark wooden floors and contemporary bamboo chandeliers makes for a nice dining ambiance.

Excellent quality Thai good that comes out in big portions makes me a big fan of this place.  The value is definitely there and I'm looking forward to trying more dishes in the near future.  Enjoy yourself...=)"}
{"text":"Fantastic fresh and amazing thai food. Super fast and friendly service. Wouldnt go anywhere else"}
{"text":"Amazing food and eat till you can't take it anymore."}
{"text":"Awesome lunch specials. Love the orange chicken it's super crispy and flavored perfectly. I also tried the coconut ice cream which was amazing! What a great place to come for lunch and got soo much food!"}
{"text":"Such a great spot with a huge vegan selection. The staff is friendly and the food is amazing. They have a great lunch special as well. I recommend the orange soy chicken and the vegan Tom Kha soup."}
{"text":"Really good and wanted more! Great lunch special and the spicing was spot on. If I ever come back to this area, I will plan another meal here."}
{"text":"This is a great place for vegans! There are three pages just for us 

I've had each of the curries and was not disappointed. 

They even have a special butterfly drink that changes colors. My girlfriend loves it. 

It can get crowded, I suggest not sitting by the door. Lots of to go orders and you're closest to the counter. 

I'm hoping they get a different fake \"chicken\". One thing I don't recommend here."}
{"text":"What a suiting name for the place - Thailicious, YUM. Recently just started to try more vegetarian/ pescatarian options, and I am so glad I found this place! They have a full menu for vegan friendly options!!

For my family, we ordered their calamari, papaya salad, chicken pad see ew, Penang curry with tofu and eggplant basil with tofu. Every dish was a 5/5! 

The calamari was seasoned very good and they paired with sweet chili sauce. The papaya salad was light and the perfect amount of crunch. Only downside is that it only comes with 2 shrimp. I didn't really eat the pad see ew but I did pick off some broccoli and those pieces were yummy! I don't eat curry, but that dish was finished between the other 3 in my group.. my brother, whose a recent vegetarian, said it was one of the best Penang curries he's had. And lastly, the eggplant basil... DELICIOUS. It was clearly my order, but I absolutely loveeeeed the way they prepared both the eggplant and tofu. Filled with lots of flavor! The curry and eggplant dish came with a side of rice, which we could care less for. Their thai coffee was also really good! I always order thai coffee in hopes it will be amazing, but it's never really good... BUT this thai coffee tasted so good, I finished all of mine and had sips from my moms. Hehe.

All in all, I literally can't wait to be back!!"}
{"text":"This place was super tasty. The owner is the nephew of the owner of Komol's, my other favorite Thai spot! And he recognized me. It was sweet! They had some great veggie options, but could use a few more."}
{"text":"I ate here because my neighbor recommended this place & said it was one of the best Thai restaurants they've been to. I honestly thought the food was average. Everyone in my party had a stomach ache after eating here. 

I guess my neighbor haven't been to many Thai restaurants to compare."}
{"text":"We have known the owner for years.  Great guy.  He and his wife have worked at Komol Kitchen with family & now have their own place.  Authentic and awesome."}
{"text":"What a fantastic new Thai restaurant for Henderson!

Let's start with the ambiance, the restaurant has a nice warm and comfortable atmosphere. Some beautiful classic Thai artwork accompanied by a modern dining area. Upon arrival we were cheerfully greeted and seated promptly. I ordered a Thai tea and it was to die for! One of the best I've ever had and it's completely vegan! 

We ordered a variety of dishes my favorites were their Beef Jerky appetizer(), Beef Pad Se Ew and Orange chicken. The Orange chicken is like no other it's got a wonderful crisp and a fantastic sweet orange sauce that tastes great with the rice.  In addition to those we ordered crispy spring rolls, seafood pad kee mao, krac pow chicken, drunken noodle, pork skewers and lard na. Everyone loved it all dishes had great authentic Thai flavors. 

For desert we shared my favorite, mango with sweet sticky rice which was no disappointment and a perfect finish to a very fulfilling dinner. I cant wait to head back to Vegas to get my Thai food fix!"}
{"text":"I'm brand new to the area [moved from San Fran] and I was looking for a good Thai place to make my regular. After speaking with the staff at the counter while placing my to-go order, I know I walked into the right place. 
The restaurant is nice and clean and very welcoming. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. I know for sure I'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT THAI FOOD AND DINING EXPERIENCE! 

Seriously this is my new favorite restaurant hands down in Henderson. Stand out service and absolutely delicious cuisine.  I went on a Monday night for the first time and quickly returned the following Wednesday. It's Friday and I'm already set to meet a friend there early this upcoming week. IT WAS THAT GOOD YOU GUYS. 

I would 100 percent recommend getting the tom kha (the one with coconut milk) soup under the vegan options. I was blown away at the flavor of this soup. It's the perfect combination of salty, sweet, and spicy. The veggies in this soup are hearty, and flavorful. Let's not forget about the incredible aroma of this soup. It's heaven. 
After my first trying their soup, I could not stop thinking about it. My four year old even asked for it days later. (That says a lot!) 

I returned for lunch two days later (they offer great lunch specials) to get a large order of the coconut milk soup and a lunch portion of yellow curry with shrimp. AGAIN- everything was phenomenal. I didn't want it to end.
I would totally recommend the salad as a side because  their ginger dressing is tangy gingery perfection. It was seriously so tasty. 
The restaurant is super clean. The service is excellent, the presentation is beautiful, and the staff is as friendly as they come. I love that they offer so many vegan options. 

I am going to make it a point to eat here weekly. Honest to goodness my new favorite spot to eat!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food hands down! great food and great service! I have ordered the sweet and sour chicken, pad thai, pad sew ew and they have all been 5 stars worthy dishes. My nee favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"If you want fresh, great-tasting Thai food for a reasonable price, this is the place! Nice, clean, modern design inside, beautiful dishes, friendly and most importantly the food is super fresh! Be prepared to wait for a table at lunch time, but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"It's hard to find a consistent Thai flavored food restaurant.  We have been to many which have changed in cooks and in ownership over the years lacking in taste and traditional flavor. Some decor needs to be updated and cleaned as it gets neglected.
This place is busy for takeout and dine in for a Wednesday night so be prepared on the weekends.
We ordered the fried eggplant, crispy spinach, eggrolls, yum woon sen, Tom kha seafood soup, shrimp pad thai noodles, and chicken yellow curry.
$72 bill and We love all dishes and enjoyed the talkative young vibe patrons eating there.
We will return to try other curries and and sides soon."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant!  Wonderful food and great service!  I ordered their Red Curry and loved the taste!  DH had Cashew a Shrimp and lived his, too.  Said it was the best he has had."}
{"text":"I have been here three times now, and it was close amazing every time!
I've had the Tom Kha Ka, the Beef Pad Se Ew, the Chicken Yellow Curry, the Thailicious Fried Rice, and the Drunken Seafood Spaghetti.  Of all those items, the only thing I wouldn't order again is the Spaghetti.  The sauce seemed too thick and made the noodles feel sticky.  Other than that, the rest of the food is awesome! My bf loves their fried rice!
The place is typically busy and their dining room is pretty small, so you can almost always expect to wait.
Other than one girl, who seemed like she really didn't want to be at work, everyone is pretty nice.  At one point, I wanted to try the mango sticky rice (it's one of my favorite thai desserts and I try it at every thai restaurant I go to), and our server was nice enough to let me know that their mangos were on the tart side and he didn't want me to be disappointed.  I really appreciated him giving me the heads up!  I will definitely try it the next time I go in though."}
{"text":"Excellent service and delicious food at a reasonable price. This is the new place to get Thai food in Henderson! Aroy Mak Mak!"}
{"text":"I visited Thailand over the summer and ever since I've been back i've been looking for good thai food and this is the place!! Pad thai is to die for"}
{"text":"I am a lucky girl!
Finally a great Thai restaurant ....finally
So many mediocre Thai restaurants in Las Vegas. 

Thailicious knocks them all out of the ballpark! 

Very high food quality 
Generous portions
$6.99 lunch specials
Great service
Quick take out

Entire Vegan menu with lots and lots of options


Call to make a reservation as there was a 20 minute wait on Monday night....it is that good!"}
{"text":"I'm a devout omnivore, but very picky since I've been to Thailand several times.  
My vegan cousin ordered a vegan broccoli beef noodle dish, that looks a lot better than my drunken noodle chicken order.  
Good standard qualify food, and served QUICKLY in a half full restaurant. 
They had the little thai peppers in fish sauce that is essential to heat and umami flavors. 
I'm going back for the vegan beef dishes..and more thai chili!  
good prices, seemed very busy so call ahead."}
{"text":"So nice to find a Thai restaurant that isn't afraid to use spice.  So many times I order a 7 or 8 at local Thai spots, only to be underwhelmed by the amount of heat.  This SE area gem will satisfy fans of spicy Thai cuisine.  They also have a few interesting items that you don't see on every other menu in town.  Great food and friendly service!"}
{"text":"Came here at peak lunch hour on a weekday. It was busy but not completely full - there were some unoccupied tables in the middle but yet there were still people waiting by the door to be seated. There were only two people working the front serving, bussing and seating people which I felt was not enough. They really need some extra help during lunch rush.

On to the food - the tofu skewer appetizer was good, but a little on the pricey side for 5 pieces of tofu. It was perfectly lightly fried, came with some dipping sauce (peanut based I think) and a mini cucumber salad.

Green curry with scallops - your typical curry but had scallops and eggplant in it. I was surprised to see this as an option because I usually don't see it on other Thai menus.

Crab fried rice - delicious. I always want to order this at every Thai restaurant. Very savory, hit the spot for me.

I'd come here again but try to avoid the lunch rush or at least get my food to go. Nice to see a Thai restaurant on this side of town."}
{"text":"This is a new quaint, trendy spot in Henderson. Conveniently located right off of 215 and Stephanie. The food is authentic and very delectable. The plated presentation was great and service was fast speedy and personable. This is my new Thai spot in Henderson"}
{"text":"First time here. We ordered pad Thai w/ shrimp which was on the border of too sweet, for our taste. We also ordered fried calamari, which was chewy because it was overcooked. However, we will be back and try something else"}
{"text":"Amazing cute place.  Always busy.  Must haves pad Thai!yellow rice and red curry make sure to get a side of roti !!  They have vegan chocolate cake and coconut ice cream"}
{"text":"So glad this restaurant opened up so close to me! The food is really delicious here and very authentic. Nice looking restaurant and service is good. Thai tea is really good, very strong and not too heavy. Dishes are very tasty and I love how you can choose your spice level on 1-10. Probably don't choose over 8. I chose 8 because I like spicy everything, and it was very spicy and the authentic Thai spices were great. Can't wait to go back! Tastes very healthy too. Good vegan and vegetarian options as well. Great variety of items."}
{"text":"A great new Thai restaurant near home that is gaining popularity quickly. We arrived on a Friday evening to find a full restaurant with a wait for a table. Plenty of people were coming and going with take out orders too.

The inside of the restaurant is clean with a bit of a modern feel. Seating is comfortable with a mix of tables and partial booths. A large menu gives plenty of options to choose from. Pricing is reasonable and makes this an inexpensive meal option. My husband joked that this was his new favorite restaurant when he saw the check at the end of the meal. Service was more someone taking our order and dropping off meals as they were ready. We didn't see much of our server, but maybe it was just a busy night.

My husband and I shared Chicken Pad Thai and Thailicious Fried Rice. Our favorite of the two was the Thailicious Fried Rice which had a great flavor with a nice amount of vegetables in the mix. The rice had both chicken and large pieces of shrimp. The Chicken Pad Thai was also good, but not the best I've had. With such a large menu I'd probably try something different next time."}
{"text":"I have had my fair share of Thai food and this place has one of the best Tum Yum soups I have ever had... Including ones in Bangkok. Staff was very friendly and place is also good for kids. The Green Papaya salad is a must and the fried eggplant is a good starter to share. We will be going to this place more often :)"}
{"text":"The crispy spinach is the best! Along with the tom kha kung!!
I've found my other love"}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed myself! The restaurant was so nicely decorated, and clean! I was happy to see that once a guest had left, the staff almost immediately cleaned up the table. The servers were very attentive, and personable! They were very helpful if you needed help with the menu! I can easily bring my vegan friends here to eat after seeing the variety of vegan options they had here! I ordered the chicken pad Thai, and was so pleasantly surprised that the food was absolutely delicious! I'm so happy to have found my new Thai spot, and having it so close to home! I'll definitely be coming back to try the other items on their menu! I highly recommend this to anyone who loves Thai food!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai restaurant in Henderson. The pad Thai is the best I have ever had. Their lunch specials are amazing and very affordable. Their soups are delicious. I love the Thai jerky."}
{"text":"I really loved this restaurant.  Eating here was a happy accident.  I've lived in Henderson for a year and 3 months.  When we first moved we had quite the struggle finding great food.  Thailicious came up in a search with great reviews but it is not close to home so we never ventured out.  My husband and I decided to go to the gym today (I haven't been in more than 6 months) and I was starving after.  I did a Yelp search for the area and Thailicious popped up.  

The best thing is that the reviews are accurate.  The restaurant looks clean.  The decor is modern.  They had nice music and the World Series of Poker was playing on the television.  I've been meaning to improve my Poker skills so this was perfect.  

I ordered the yellow curry mostly because I wanted potatoes.  The waitress said I could have just had the potatoes in the green one, but I didn't want to be a high maintenance customer.  I order a hot level of six because I wasn't sure what hot actually is for this place.  I like hot, hot food.  I think it's only been twice in my life when someone said a fish would set your mouth on fire and it actually did. Once eating Shrimp Diablo in Cali at some dive joint that set my pants on fire and another time at a Korean Barbecue while eating a random appetizer.  I think they set you on fire there so you'll leave and stop the AYCE.  The number 6 for me was mild.  I'll try an 8 next time for comfortably spicy.  

I also had a Thai Iced Tea.  I've never really liked this drink but it's something my husband would normally drink.  It sounded refreshing this day.  I enjoyed it for once.  Most places that he gets his tea from has a bitter brew.  This tasted strong but not old.  I'm not a fan of the bitter stuff. 

We order the crab delight (Rangoon) appetizer.  The presentation was pretty.  I swiped the flower and took it home and it now is living in my meditation room.  They prices were small but delicious.  

Hubby got the chicken satay to go as he wasn't hungry.  Poor thing missed out.  I like my food hot and fresh.  He said it was, \"Okay.\"  I'm sure if he had been in the mood for Thai and hungry it would have been more than okay.  

All righty folks.  That's all I've got.  Wait! I have left overs so I've got this and that.  

Ciao! Enjoy Thailicious!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, great ambiance, great customer service, loved everything about this place. We tried a few items off the Vegan menu. 
Tom yum soup: broth was surprisingly very flavorful. However, the huge chunks of vegetables were not practical for eating in a soup. That being said, I would probably still order this again since the broth was yum! 
Vegan fried rice: by the looks of it, it seemed pretty plain, but man was it good. Probably my favorite dish of the night! So much flavor infused into the rice. Definitely recommend!
Vegan chowmein: well made. Good ratio of noodles to veggies. Also very flavorful.
On a side note, if you ask for spicy, expect it to be spicy!
I love that they didn't skimp on the spice for me 
Overall, glad we discovered this little place, definitely will be back. Wish they would open a location in Las vegas!"}
{"text":"Top Thai restaurant in all of Las Vegas, competes with some well known ones may be even better. Taste and quality is amazing, service is great as well. Lunch specials are amazing! Starting to gain popularity the waits are starting to get up there."}
{"text":"Excellent vegan options! Staff is always nice. Decor is modern and clean. Orders are prompt. Prices are reasonable. Never had any problems :)"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and I can say 4 stars is a good enough rating for this restaurant. Lunch special soup is pretty tasty but it always seem to be lukewarm. Tofu also seems to be slightly warm. I don't feel like the food is cooked to order since it's barely warm when I receive it. Pad sew ew is delicious, and the pho is amazing as well as the soy chicken but I didn't enjoy the pad Thai. Restaurant has a nice ambiance but seats are uncomfortable. Too claustrophobic for my liking."}
{"text":"Just visited Thailicious on its grand opening day and it was so nice to see how well prepared they were! We arrived around 6:00 and were seated immediately. Tables were quickly starting to fill up but we were glad to see that our order was brought out promptly. The restaurant is clean and spacious; their staff attentive, and the food is delicious! We ordered some pad thai, veggie fried rice, and yellow curry--all of which were comforting and flavorful. I did notice that they don't ask for a spice level for any of their dishes. Personally, I do not mind this at all and actually prefer they determine that themselves, but just a heads up for those of you who are used to that at other Thai restaurants. Thailicious also has an extensive plant-based/vegan menu apart from the regular menu, so there was something for everyone. I am definitely bringing my whole family next time!"}
{"text":"I ate in this rest. they put too much MSG
I felt awful after i left the rest. My heart beat very fast and i feel weird
usually when i eat at Thai,Chinese and Vietnamese rest like that because of the MSG
thats why i dont go that kind of restaurant but I love Asian food."}
{"text":"Love thai food and wanted to give this fast causal place a try! Gotta say I'm a fan. 

Place is kept up well. Service was fast and friendly. Food portions are generous and the prices are comparable to thai restaurants. They have a pretty large menu so there is plenty to choose from. 

Between two people we ordered crabmeat fried rice, panna chicken curry and thai noodles. Didn't even come close to finishing anything. All dishes were flavorful and good. Also had the wonton soup, the cup was good for two people to have as a starter. 

For dessert, I love mango sticky rice. Many thai places either run out or mango is hardly in season so they don't have it. I was surprised to see that they did and it was so darn good. The sticky rice is purple so don't be alarmed, it tasted just like any other sticky rice you've had before. 

Overall, I think we found our new local thai spot and will be back for more."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, people are very friendly and welcome. Foods was good. If you are vegan, I would recommended this place. Lunch special is very inexpensive. Family and kids friendly."}
{"text":"Everything taste so fresh and delicious! I always look forward to eating here! Love their vegan options! Try the thai green tea, as delicious as the thai ice tea!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and great location! 

We drove from Summerlin to have lunch at this restaurant, it is that good.  

The service was good and the variety of food options were plentiful.

I recommend this restaurant to anyone that likes Thai or is a vegan, you will walk away full and happy."}
{"text":"Prior to returning home from our Las Vegas vacation, we stopped in at Thailicious for lunch.  Several specials are offered that include a spring roll and a choice of soup du jour (vegetable) or salad (iceberg lettuce with peanut dressing). I chose soup, my wife salad, I made the (much) better choice.  My wife ordered pad Thai with chicken that was very good as was my pad kra pao (ground chicken with garlic, bell peppers and basil leaves).  Serving size was immense so only the hungry need apply."}
{"text":"Great spot for fresh Thai food in the Henderson area. I have had the pad se ew noodle dish, panang curry, and chicken pad Thai. All have been non-greasy and seasoned well. If you don't like things spicy, you can request the spice level to be zero. The Butterfly Pea Lemongrass Drink is my favorite here. It has a hint of lemongrass and comes in blue, but when you squeeze the lemon in and mix it, it turns purple! 

I have not dined inside, but have mostly gone in for pick ups for to go orders. With its growing popularity, dinner time can get busy, but you can always call ahead for pick up. The restaurant is very clean and well decorated as well. There is a T.V. on usually playing sports which I like. There is a mixed lot of people from families to couples dining in, so the place is great for a variety of occasions. There is also a section in the menu that is vegan friendly. So there is something for everyone. Will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"I read the write up for this location in the zip code magazine that is published monthly. Sounded like a great place so my husband and I went to check it out around 5:30 pm a few days ago. Unfortunately, we did not have the best experience. The restaurant was freezing (no heat). Everyone was eating wearing their jackets. There was a really loud group who sat and sat talking loudly and rude most of the time we were there. 
The food was OK but since it was barely warm it was hard to decide. I mentioned it to our waiter who said he would heat them up in the microwave. No thanks. 
We sent the tea back because it was tepid if you could even call it that. They finally brought out a pot of \"hot\" water with a tea bag (no loose tea). Hey, I carry tea bags in my purse.
White rice was to come with both our entrees but we only got one order which was barely warm and then when we were packing our to go cartons, because who wants to eat cold food, they brought the other order which was hot, but we were leaving. Not the best recommendation. They need to up their game. I did see a lot of pick up orders so maybe that is their specialty. (You can then heat up the food at home)."}
{"text":"The food was good, but it came with consequences.  My wife and I have both been nauseous and stomach-ill since eating here 18 hours ago.  2-stars due to that and the fact that half of my noodles were stuck together and I had to cut pancake-like pieces to eat them.  Nice small clean place, but it's unlikely we'll return."}
{"text":"Liked the food here, Tasty and spicy Thai food with lot of options ( lot of vegan options too). Will be back again soon to try the lunch menu."}
{"text":"Yes, this Thai restaurant does get a 4 stars for me. It's wonderful to find local restaurants in your neighborhood meet outstanding quality control with their food. The reason it's 4 and not 5 is because of their service. They are quite busy and the staff multitasks constantly. They need more staff to help out with the volume they receive at dinner time. BUT, the food is simply delicious! A \"bit pricey,\" but they have quality ingredients."}
{"text":"I was very excited to learn that there was another vegan friendly restaurant in Henderson. 

We came in on a Saturday night and they were pretty busy but we only waited about 20 mins for a table which wasn't bad. 

The wait staff was apologetic about the wait and very attentive. I ordered the vegan papaya salad and vegan Mongolian tofu. Both dishes were amazing. I loved the freshness of the papaya salad, the crispness of the green beans and cabbage. I loved the Mongolian sauce. 

Place seems to be gaining popularity. Every table was full and there was a steady flow of take out customers. 

I will definitely be back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Wrong turn and ended up here...very fortunate 
Supperb taste and great service. 

Tried drunken noodles, pad ki sew, and some deep fried fish cake. Ohh wow!!!"}
{"text":"Be prepared to be surprised the first time you eat here!! This place is comparable to or better than any of the better known Thai eateries in the Valley!! I could eat their Drunken Noodles pretty much every day and never get tired of them. And their gelation flower dessert is something you have to try at least once!!"}
{"text":"Don't pass this up if you're in the area, Great Thai and clean slick restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing Thai food even better I can I live in the complex in the plaza going back very soon worth going I recommend this spot to every one who likes Thai food , staff is very friendly , an they offer a Vegan menu for your convenience."}
{"text":"Food is great!! Love it. It a very small place and they're service isn't good due to it being so busy. Now we know just to order take out. Great food and clean place"}
{"text":"Amazing food and friendly staff. I've never had a bad meal. My favorite is the vegan avocado green curry, vegan green curry, drunken noodles, or pad se ew. ******A request to the owner; please change your to-go packaging. It is awful how everything is in foam packaging, which leaks chemicals into food, hurts the environment since it doesn't decompose. Please switch to paper-based packaging, and paper bags instead of plastic.******"}
{"text":"We ordered the papaya salad and the pad woon sen. 
The interior is pretty nice. Clean. Nice decor. No weird food odors. 

Papaya salad was bland. I said medium spicy and it was seriously a 0. Not even a hint of spicy. Not only was it not spicy but there was no taste. It was very bland. 

Pad woon sen was also very bland. The beef is tough and rubbery. The noodles were not over cooked which is good but I believe I will not come here again."}
{"text":"Went at lunchtime.
Had the lunch special which included soup and a fried spring roll.
The soup of the day had cucumbers in it. Cucumbers in a soup? Blech was my first thought but it was actually really good.
The pad Thai was very flavorful and not dry like some places.
Spice at 4 was somewhat mild, but that is always tricky when trying a new Thai place out.
Will definer be back, my new favorite Thai in Henderson"}
{"text":"Definitely needed for the Foothills area, excellent customer service. The menu was amazing and had so many options! For a veg kick or traditional Thai food, I would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"The panang curry was a little thinner than I am used to but the flavor is fantastic. Yellow curry also has amazing flavor. What stood out to me about this place is the soup they provide with the lunch specials actually has flavor and isn't just a hot cup of water with some random veggies thrown in.  It is closer to me than any of the other Thai restaurants I frequent so I will definitely be back and I am excited to try more things from their menu"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Very tasty. I love it! The only downside.. which could also be considered good.. is that they are very busy. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"A great and fantastic addition to the growing Thai food choices in the valley. This one may be one of the best in the Henderson area:

1. Location - In a strip mall right off the 215 and Stephanie in Henderson, it is convenient and easy to find.

2. Ambiance - Really liked the interior design of the place, Simple, but well done, plenty of seating options and a great and friendly staff.

3.  Service - Top notch. You will never run out of ice water here for sure.  And you can tell that they have great teamwork here because they all help each other and when your food is ready, you can be served by any of the team.  I like that as your food comes out hot.

4.  Wait time - We came at a 4:30 on Saturday and there were already several people dining and others waiting for take out.  By about 5:15, the place was getting pretty packed. I am gonna think that this place is pretty darn busy.

5.  The food -  Loved it.  The vegan choices here are fantastic and there are about 4 pages of vegan choices on the menu.

Paradise Salad - With green apples. nice and refreshing.

Eggplant and Basel with ground pork - a fantastic dish, great presentation and taste. As you know, I really enjoy this dish with ground meat, as it picks up the flavor more than sliced meats.

Tom Yum Soup with Chicken - Great tasting with mushrooms and tomatoes. Not the best in the world, but definitely good.

Masaman Curry with Beef -  We always get the yellow curry and sometimes the Masaman curry. The wife tends to like the yellow curry due to thicker and sweet with the coconut milk.  The Masaman is less spicy and has more of that Indian type of flavor

Avocado Green Curry (Vegan) - This was recommend by our waitress, who used to work at Thai Room on Tropicana and Pecos, which is by my office and I see here there.  This was something that was interesting with the avocado, and all the veggies. Overall very nice dish.

The pricing was great, service wonderful, ambiance was perfect.  A great quick meal and we enjoyed it thoroughly.  We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing...especially during lunch! They offer a great lunch menu and even better prices. I paid $8 for a spring roll, soup and pad thai. Their lunch special is $6.99 but for $1.50 more I added shrimp to my pad thai. 

I thought the flavor was great and the portion was hearty. I left feeling satisfied and wanting to come back a second time to try more of their offerings. When I opened the menu I was literally struggling to find something to order because everything looked really good. 

I am def coming back to this place. The service was fast and friendly. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I ordered takeout--Thai Beef Jerky and Veggie Tom Kha. The Thai Beef Jerky was dee-lic-ious. So good. The sauce it comes with is ridiculous (so good). The dish didn't come with rice, but luckily I had some steam-in-bag jasmine rice from Trader Joe's in the freezer. I was really looking forward to the mushrooms I saw in the other photos of Tom Kha. In fact, that's why I chose the veggie option, because I thought for sure it would have mushrooms. There were exactly zero mushrooms in my soup however. Nonetheless, it was still good. It was loaded with cabbage, tomatoes, zucchini, carrots and just the right amount of spice. Overall I was pleased with my dishes and already have a list of items I want to order next time. I may order takeout again next time though because when I walked in to collect my food the restaurant lighting was on full force. Felt a little like when they turn the lights on after an evening at the bar and it's leaving time. I prefer a bit dimmer lighting at dinner time! Not a deal breaker though."}
{"text":"Just enjoyed their Salmon dish. I've been around the world more times than a space satellite...and eaten at the best of the best. This dish blew my socks off
.No doubt about it ...this my new favorite restaurant...and this salmon dish has me hooked...great portion size to boot. Be sure to order their vegan chocolate cake....a killer dessert for only $5.00."}
{"text":"First time here on Wednesday! Love the atmosphere and everyone here is very nice.  Food was great.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"YUmmmm Thailicious is right! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because we waited a little long to get an appetizer order in and it took awhile to get the bill paid . But if you have time the food is super super delicious and they have the best selection of vegan options. First time here, but I am a new loyal customer. Best curry I've had in awhile ;)"}
{"text":"Got the beef pad sew ew and it was really good! Also recommend the Thai tea, I've had a lot of Thai tea from different places and this one has been one of the best."}
{"text":"Went in on a Friday evening at it was packed! -good sign!

We live close by so rather than waiting we just ordered it to go, went home, and came back to pick it up when it was ready.

The space itself is small and cozy, there's only seating for 2 if there is any kind of waiting going on. Also, I found the lighting to be too bright for the time of day. It didn't feel like dinner service ambiance, it felt like they were trying to illuminate the room like a cafeteria would be.

All in all, the food was excellent! One slight miscue with a special request of a tofu pad Thai dish, but still very enjoyable and some of the better Thai food I've has in town!"}
{"text":"My favorite thai joint in town! Beats every other place in terms of quality for price-point. Of course, their atmosphere and service are both clean, stylish and inviting, and exceptional as well. Plus, their lunch menu at $7 (includes soup/salad with ginger or peanut dressing and main entree) can't be beat. It's without a doubt my husband and I's weekly to bi-weekly go-to. Pad thai with shrimp/chicken, red curry, yellow curry, and spicy eggplant approved thus far!"}
{"text":"Excellent!!!! Thai PLUS Vegan=full heart and full tummy. They have both regular and vegan options here and the food taste amazing. They were very accommodating when we didn't realize a dish had onions-they changed it a re-did the dish without any issues. This is my second time already and won't be my last!"}
{"text":"The servers were super sweet. Great food at great prices. Becarecul with the spice levels and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Lunch special combo here 2:58 pm on Mon/8 Jan 2018:
- Really filling lunch: soup with tons of veggies, good-size eggroll, lots of beef pad se-ew.  
- I also got all four curries for take-out and they're also large portions  And the soup is included in the take-out (some places only provide the lunch special's soup with dine-in).

{"text":"Awesome food, love it!! We went there without reservation but staff was friendly and could accommodate us. I would definitely go back there."}
{"text":"The yellow curry was absolutely amazing! I got level 3 because I love spicy and it was perfect ! I come into town every three months on business and I will defiantly be coming back to this place. I also ordered the corn puffs ( I think that's what their called) it was a fried sweet corn patty ! Mouth watering. I highly recommend it !"}
{"text":"Excellent! The last time I looked for Thai in Henderson, Thailicious was not open! I'm glad I did another search! This place is small, so there is limited seating and it gets busy. Food and service is GREAT!!"}
{"text":"Great experience. 

Had to run an errand on east side of town and needed to grab a bite to eat. The ratings of this restaurant said give it a try. 

Restaurant was packed and told 30 minute wait. Was only 10. Staff turned over tables quickly. 

Nice menu. Good Vegan and non vegan choices. 

Had the beef jerky. Excellent. Penang Chicken. Best dish. Just slightly sweet and seasoned at 5/10. Not too hot, but nice kick. Also did eggplant and duck dishes. Both excellent. 

Having lived in Thailand, my only comment was the food was very slightly sweet, more than I am used to, but that is my personal preference. (And this is a very minor critique)

Great service. Attentive staff. Very clean. 

Talked to owners. Mother in kitchen and sons manage. Very good family business. They will continue to do well if they keep attention to detail and keep the service standards high like they are now."}
{"text":"Hello, and welcome to Thailicious Authentic Thai & Vegan. We have not had Thai food in a long while and I had seen some great YELP reviews so we decided to venture away from our normal eating habits in the area and try this lovely restaurant. We arrived and it was swarming with people and the place was buzzing. We got one of the last seats at a small table and were given menus and had our drink order taken. You can tell this was going to be an excellent meal by how busy it was and many seemed to be regulars. The wait staff was quite personable with the guests and we looked forward to ordering. We went with a simple plan of a thai beef jerky appetizer, sticky rice, Chicken Pad Thai, and Pork fried Rice. The Jerky was actually more tender than expected from previous bad experiences at other Thai spots. There was a slightly spicy marinade and a very spicy dipping sauce. Not sure what was in it but it was yummy. The Pad Thai was also ordered to a not spicy feel. Thinly sliced noodles with bits of egg, bean sprouts and green onions. Crispy sprouts and flavor filled noodles that I was gobbling up like it was my last meal. The Pork rice was relatively standard and quite filling and a good portion.I did like how the flavored the pork with a sour following taste after the initial bit. Sort of a Pork adobo  feel. 
I must also mention a portion of the menu has a fully Vegan area to it. Unsure if the Vegan is prepared wholly separate or not. However the selection was vast in comparison to most Vegan selections. I guess with Vegan in your title you better deliver. 
Thank you for dining at Thailicious Authentic Thai & Vegan. We took our stuff to go since we had so much  left over, and it was just as good the next day. We will  be visiting again. amazing food with a great convenient location in our favorite city of Henderson. Check them out first chance you get. One of the best Thai food places I have been to."}
{"text":"Delicious neighborhood Thai restaurant. 
I've ordered takeout many times and have really enjoyed everything. 
Pad Thai, Pad se ew, Penang, and the soup."}
{"text":"So so so good. I have eaten at many Thai restaurants and this was, by far, the best. I can tell they are using quality ingredients. Service was good. We ordered the Papaya Salad - it was large and very good. We also ordered the Drunken Noodle dish - it was probably the best Drunken Noodle I have ever had. We had the Sea Bass with fried basil (I can't recall the name of that one - but it was just perfect), and we ordered the Avocado Green Curry - again, it was amazing. And we had a coconut soup with vegetables. It was perfectly seasoned and really good. We ordered everything vegan (except the fish) and our party shared it all. We also had three vegan desserts - the chocolate cheesecake, fried banana with coconut ice cream and mango sticky rice. All three desserts were stellar. We will be back. FIVE entrees and three desserts + green tea for everyone came to around $80. That's a pretty low price for such good food. I was impressed."}
{"text":"This place is nice, but.... how authentic I'm not sure. But what do I know I just love Thai food. Service is great and location is good too. Maybe it was just that day but when I ask for a six ( on how hot I want my chow ) wooooohooo ! It was really hot ! Like it was a 10. I didn't want to return it. Because my server was awesome. I can come back here if have to it's only a block from where I live. :)"}
{"text":"Love the food here! My classmates and I average going at least once a week. Hubby had never had Thai food and was really impressed as well. Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Giving this place an A+!!! Phenomenal service, AMAZING prices, and incredible dishes! Such an awesome vegan menu! We ordered the Yellow Curry, Tofu Pad Thai, and crispy spring rolls. The Yellow Curry sauce was to die for! The pad thai and crispy rolls were also very tasty. This will be our go-to vegan Thai food resturaunt!"}
{"text":"Thai coffeee was aaaaaammazing. 
We had papaya salad, drunken noodles, and crispy duck Panang curry. 
We ordered all the dishes at 4 spicy, and it wasn't unbearably spicy, the noodles were t very spicy and that helped break up the heat a little bit. 
Service was a little slow, we sat for about 10 minutes before we placed orders. And it was kind of the same when we finished and wanted the bill. 
Definitely the some of the best Thai food I've had in Henderson."}
{"text":"I can honestly say this place is legit legit. It's worth the wait and it's local. We had to wait a little but the fact that they have vegan options, and are accommodating to dietary restrictions make me wanna go back."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant completely by chance using the monocle feature. Figuring I like Thai and my daughter is a vegetarian it was a place to try. Glad we did. Place was pretty full when we got there but we're seated right away. By the time we left there was a line out the door. One guy in line said that he has been there every week since they opened. My daughter had the Green Curry, I had the Pad Kra Pao and we took an order of Mongolian Beef to go home for the wife. It was all excellent. We will definitely put this on our list of places to revisit with friends and family. My suggestion is go early rather than late or else expect a wait. It's worth it though."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  We happened by this place and ended up going 3 weeks in a row. The drunken noodles are delicious, chicken satay and pad Thai are solid as well. Restaurant is super clean as well. Highly recommend Thailicious"}
{"text":"Green Valley finally has a stellar Thai food place. 

We arrived on the opening weekend and they were slammed with a slight wait. The food was well worth the wait. Everything was fresh, good portion size and tasted amazing. Lots of options for meat loves and vegan/vegetarian. A REALLY extensive menu if you are vegan, one of the best I have seen in Vegas. 

The staff were a little overwhelmed with how busy it was, but they remained helpful and very friendly. We tried the fresh summer rolls, tom yum soup, and pad woon sen. Summer rolls were fresh, crispy and delicious and came with addictive chili sauce and creamy peanut sauce. Soup was spicy, lemongrassy and delicious. Good chunks of quality chicken. Pad woon sen was full of fresh crunchy veg and had a great flavor. We also had a fresh coconut juice and a butterfly pea lemongrass juice which tasted like the milk after a bowl of Trix (in the greatest way possible!)

Overall an amazing meal and so so so excited to have an excellent Thai option in Green Valley. My new go-to in Vegas."}
{"text":"Maybe the best Thai place in town... for vegans. Will definitely come again for the panang."}
{"text":"If you like sweet-tasting food, this is the place to go. For me, all the food we had was way too sweet and the chicken and duck was overcooked and chewy. The customer service was great! 
Panang Crispy duck- over fried, chewy, hard to swallow. Too sweet.
Chicken Panang curry- Too sweet, tough/ dry chicken. 
Soft shell crab- Tasted like old oil, over fried.
Rangoons- were good! 
Fish cake- Dry. 

Honestly, the customer service was the best thing here."}
{"text":"THAILICIOUS was amazing! I came with a bunch of friends and it's vegan and vegetarian friendly! Super cute and modern ambiance. 
I tried the Butterfly pea lemongrass juice is refreshing . Almost like a fruity pebbles but like a juice. The lemongrass hint tasted amazing! The lemon changes the color of the juice from blue to purple and makes it tastes sweeter & fruitier!
Then ordered a shrimp pad Thai which wasn't too spicy from a scale from 1-10. I ordered a 2 since I'm sensitive on spice. I ended up adding a little chili sauce to spice it up more. I also tried the Tom Yum was good but needed more lime and spices and after 3 limes, it tasted better. I also tried the Fried Eggplant with sweet & sour sauce, it was amazing! The fried Tofu with brown sugar peanut sauce is also great too!

Jaida was kind enough to even bring a dessert for the birthday celebrant which looked amazing and it was!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! I'm heartbroken that I just bought a house on the other side of town. The vegan chow mein and vegan panang were flavorful and the spice level was exactly how I wanted it (mild side of medium). Some Thai restaurants will blow you out of the water with heat but not this place. I will drive across town to eat here again (or just stop in when coming back from California)."}
{"text":"Really delicious food with a beautiful presentation! It's nice to see a restaurant present tgeir dishes as of you're on the strip.  Reasonable prices too! We came in close to closing so the servers kind of ignored us when it came to the bill, but over all everyone was really nice and attentative throughout service."}
{"text":"Location: Right in the middle of Henderson in one of the many strip malls  which line all of the main roads. 

Venue: Fresh clean modern casual restaurant with waiter service and takeout available.

Large Menu:  Lunch Specials, vegetarian dishes, appetizers, desserts,  pho, and many assorted dishes including meats and curries found in most Thai restaurants. I would describe this as modern Thai with some other complimentary asian dishes. It has less focus on classic authentic Thai specialities. 

We had the Massaman Tofu Curry, Roti Bread, crispy eggplant, beef and meatball noodle soup (pho like soup and noodles). They were all good but we just touched the surface of the menu. The lunch specials looked like good values.

Good food, vegetarian options, good service and fair prices. I'm a fan.

{"text":"Oh my goodness, this was the BEST Thai food I've EVER had!!!!! We tried the Thai beef jerky for appetizer and it was incredibly delicious. Then we ordered the Panang  chicken curry and drunken noodle chicken dish and finished it all. If there weren't other people there we seriously would have licked the plates, lol! This place is going to be a big hit!"}
{"text":"I keep finding my self coming back to this place. By far the best pad Thai I've had in Vegas. Food is always top notch with fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Best vegan food I've tried so far. Curry was a little spicy at a three but tasted amazing! We ate so fast I couldn't take a picture! Staff was on point with service and water refills. Def check this place out of you get a chance."}
{"text":"Brand new place right off the 215 and Stephanie. 

Interior is very welcoming not to mention the staff as well. We were sited right away and the food did not take more than 30 min. Would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Yelp alerted me to this hot and new location, and when I saw they had Khao Soi, I placed an order immediately. They deliver too!! Came promptly, everything was fresh and delicious. This is such a game changer for our neighborhood!!
Welcome to henderson!!"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai in Henderson/Las Vegas and they have Separate VEGAN options!! Excellent service, always clean facilities, a fun clean atmosphere complete with sports TV running and delicious food to boot."}
{"text":"They were nice enough to label vegan on their store front sign, so we we were in! Friendly staff, great vegan options, and quick service. The owner came out and was working with the staff which is nice to see. Our expectations are high because Naga has spoiled us for so long, but we were surprised! I'll be back for sure! Pineapple fried rice game over. Non diary Thai tea Ooh! Curry on point."}
{"text":"Food here was delicious!! We enjoyed the vegan food. The avocado green curry and the soy orange chicken with the steamed bun for the appetizer. Recommend giving this place a try! They recently opened so come support family owned vegan restaurant. Oh! They also have vegetarian and regular food aswell 

We have vegan channel at YouTube (TBVEGAN)
Also on Instagram (TBVEGAN) 
We do reviews for vegan restaurants, bakeries, and vegan recipes
Check us out :)"}
{"text":"AMAZING, need I say more  well I have to according to yelp. I'll definitely be going back, stimulated new taste buds in my mouth lol"}
{"text":"Tried three menu items, all were fantastic! Nice presentation and relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"We met up with some friends here last Friday for lunch and this new spot lives up to its name:  Thailicious!  The lunch specials are fabulous!  I had the $6.99 Chicken Pad Thai because I always have to try Pad Thai when I go to a new Thai spot.  The portion was very generous for a lunch special and I had leftovers to take home.  The restaurant is nice and bright and the service was fantastic.  I'd definitely come back for more and extra points for being close to my workplace."}
{"text":"First time visiting today for lunch and the Pad Thai was amazing as well as the mixed veggies.  The spice level 6 was hot but oh so tasty. This is definitely my new favorite place to eat!!!! Thank u for coming to Henderson.  The staff is wonderful too!"}
{"text":"We discovered this spot via Yelp and we were not disappointed!  The Thai teas are delicious!  The curries are amazing and we love that you can control the spice level.  My youngest loves the shrimp chow mein...he would prefer less bok choy and more shrimp.  I've had the duck red curry twice and I love it!  My husband loves the avocado green curry.  The fried wontons and crispy and tasty.  We have dined in restaurant and dine take out.  This is one of our new favorites for sure!"}
{"text":"Food: authentic Thai and great lunch specials for $6.99. Can't beat that deal! Had the chicken panang curry lunch special, which comes with rice, fried egg roll and salad or soup. I chose the salad which has a choice of ginger or peanut dressing. The ginger dressing was tangy and refreshing. You can specify the spicy level on the curry 1-10. I got 1 which was spicy for me, but I have low tolerance for spice. 

Ambiance: nicely decorated, clean restaurant.

Service: friendly and consistently fill water glasses. 

Location: conveniently located in the same plaza as the mini golf right off the 215 off Stephanie. Plenty of parking shared in the plaza."}
{"text":"This was my second time giving Thailicious a shot. Needless to say, I left very disappointed. I had came here the first time & had gotten the lunch special made vegan which was no issue. However, the lady taking our order quickly shut us down with an attitude and told us that it wasn't made vegan... Umm what? We had it done before! We brushed it off however and ended up ordering the Pad Se-Ew & the Pad Thai; vegan. The Pad Thai tasted extremely watered down and flavorless. Absolutely disappointing. Pad Se-Ew was okay. Afterwards, it took FOREVER for them to come back to our table with our check. As soon as we finally gave our check back to pay, she started to get very passive aggressive!! Bad customer service and average food. I really don't see the appeal here."}
{"text":"Best Thai food we have found in the area. We have tried many dishes here and everyone of them have been delicious."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  They hit it out of the park.  Such a great vegan selection to choose from.  Everything was fresh.  The soy chicken satay were a great start to our meal.  The peanut sauce was amazing.  The drunken noodles and panang tofu were excellent.  We can't say enough good things about this place.  Definitely coming back very soon!!"}
{"text":"The flavors here are spot on! High quality ingredients and great chefs.
Lots of vegan options, too!
There can be a wait, so check that before heading out"}
{"text":"So so good! Finally a place that has both vegan and non vegan options. Everything they use is super fresh and the prices are so low and reasonable. Definitely new fav Thai spot. The owner as well is a really nice guy, you can tell he works hard to make sure everything is going well. Would 100% recommend! Everyone should try the soups for sure."}
{"text":"So happy this place opened up right by my house. I was also happy to see that their lunch menu included pad see ew. So hard to find this on a lunch menu at other Thai restaurants. I like my food with a little kick, so I asked for 7 out of 10 on the spice. It came out perfect. I will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food! Hubby and I shared a summer rolls (aka fresh spring rolls) green curry and spicy noodle. Both were excellent and my husband is now a fan of Thai curry. Service was equally good. We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Are here twice during a stay in vegas, omfg so good. I recommend the seafood or combo with your choice of either pad thai or pan see EU noodles. They stuffed our plates with a good variety of meats. I ordered medium spicy fir flavor, I wish they had this back home in sd"}
{"text":"My sisters and I tried this Thai place today and we were not disappointed! All of us are vegetarian, so to have a whole menu of vegan options was a dream! 

Every single thing we had was delicious, from our fried eggplant and fried tofu appetizers, to our entrees of chow mien, sweet and sour tofu, and green avocado curry, and to our desserts of friend banana and coconut ice cream, coconut ice cream and waffle, and chocolate cheesecake!

And although it's a small place, the vibe is super nice and the employees are extremely friendly! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious and all the workers are friendly felt welcome and service was quick didn't have to wait long for food to come out"}
{"text":"Some of the best customer service I've seen lately! Very friendly staff and clean environment. The food is delicious and the atmosphere is adorable."}
{"text":"First time here but definitely not the last!!!! Highly recommend this place. With so many choices in the valley for Thai food, Thailicious is a definite standout."}
{"text":"This place has really good authentic food.  The restaurant is built really well from what i see and i love the pic of the  thai scenery on the far wall..

Great ambience and the costumer service was really good. Dutch made you feel appreciated.  

I will def come back here"}
{"text":"It is simply the best.  I can't believe the extensive vegan menu as well.  I hope they expand into the empty space next door.  Super clean and elegant presentation.   Get anything. You won't be disappointed.    I can't imagine how another Thai place like the famous Lotus could be that much better.  If it got much better it would break my mouth!"}
{"text":"Very clean and nicely decorated restaurant. Super friendly people working there. Great menu and lunch choices for $6.99. Food was fast and super delicious, cooked exactly the way it was asked for. In Asian restaurants, I sometimes wait for an hour to see how I feel after the food for lunch. Sometimes there is MSG and other stuff in there that makes you feel horrible. both me and my wife feel great. Already making plans to go back there. I am usually not the big Thai fan, the wife is, but I have to say it was delicious ... Can only recommend trying."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Thai place close to me!.. their Vegan choices are delicious!.. I also tried the chicken yellow curry and the shrimp Pad se-ew.. soooo good!! Yummy and refreshing Thai tea! I was starving when I arrived and the service was quick and efficient so I was able to eat right away."}
{"text":"Can I just say wow!  Now I know why my friend had her daughters bday dinner here. This place had some pretty amazing dishes. The best part about the dishes they were vegan!  I am not a vegan, but I do enjoy Thai food and the occasional vegan dish. I will definitely bring my vegan friends to this establishment. Now I am little bummed because I didn't get to snap any pics, I arrived late and everyone was already eating and engaging in conversation, but I will definitely on my next visit. The pad Thai noodles were delicious, it was very flavorful and had a nice taste and texture, now I know that's a popular dish, but I have been to few Thai places that try to add extra ingredients or spices, now this place keep it authentic and it was good!  The other dish, I had had thicker rice noodles and I can't remember the proper name but it was delicious.
I can't wait to try more dishes here in my next visit"}
{"text":"Welcome brand new thai place in Henderson that is absolutely thai-licious! 

Babe loves taking me to new places and since we found out about this place we've already been three times. And they haven't been open long, so that's definitely saying something. I've called for pick up, dined in after a gym session, and came for lunch. They have awesome service (super friendly, always make sure you're okay and your drinks are filled), a great interior (super clean, ikea furniture, awesome floors and walls), and even better food (tasty, authentic, delicious)! The portions are big for what you pay and the food tastes really good. 

We've had the pad thai, tom ka, and thailicious fried rice. All of which are super yummy! The thai tea is also pretty good if you wanna try it. If you're in the area or wanting to taste some flavorful thai food, stop by! I know you'll love it! 

Thanks for always fulfilling my thai cravings!"}
{"text":"There are many Thai restaurants to choose from in the valley but we love this one best. The service is good and the staff is friendly. The menu has a great selection without being overwhelming. The prices are reasonable and portions just right. The vegetarian and vegan options are amazing. It's great to have a Thai place that offers more than just tofu options to its regular menu.  The soups are my favorite--full of veggies. The veggie spring rolls are delicious. The meat options are tasty too. You can add heat to any dish in reasonable increments."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Thai place in Las Vegas.  Everything from the decor and service to the food was spot on!  I am vegan and this place offers an extensive vegan menu. I had the pad Thai with tofu and the papaya salad, both were delicious!  I will definitely be back - can't wait to try all of the dishes!"}
{"text":"This place was soooo delicious!! They offer an entire vegan menu (hooray!!! Finally a vegan Thai tea!!!!) This place deserves 10 stars for variety and flavor! The food was delicious and inexpensive! Try the pad Thai and make sure you don't forget to order the roti with your curry dishes!!"}
