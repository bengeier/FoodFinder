{"text":"SCS is a huge Asian grocery store in the heart of downtown LV not too far a distance from the strip. Great location for both tourists n locals to shop or dine in at the food court too."}
{"text":"Me and my wife dined at Grill City inside Seafood City Supermarket. My wife ordered grilled milkfish, pork nonagon fan and rice. After dining, we go for shopping inside the grocery where my wife felt an upset stomach and spent most of her time at the bathroom. And felt uncomfortable the whole night through. Not a good experience eating in a Filipino Restaurant inside the Seafood City in Las Vegas.  Sorry to say such words b'coz I'm a Filipino and I support Filipino businesses everywhere I go....! But all I can is this; please serve fresh foods...!"}
{"text":"WOW!  I called these people to ask a simple pricing question and the woman on the other end said they didn't carry my item anymore and hung up promptly!  No suggestions where I could find it, or how much it should cost at a good place....just a dial tone.  didn't think lobster was such a sensitive subject and when I tried to call back to talk to a manager, since she hung up before I could get another question out, without a goodbye, the phone was picked up and hung up AGAIN!!  So far they are shooting for really bad reviews with me.  If you are answering the phone as an employee don't be rude!  What a moron, customer service is not rocket science!  I called back a third time for the manager and what do you know; not available; I guess I'll just have to pay them a personal visit and trust me guys you won't like what I have to say."}
{"text":"It has lots of Ready-to-Eat food .  The store has a lot of Asian food. It is a Filipino market. I go here all the time. They have great BBQ, really good!"}
{"text":"I guess seafood at Seafood City was fine; but I tried their cross-cut ribs and ended up embarassing myself to friends. I've been cooking Korean BBQ all my life but the ones I got from Seafood City were very  tough meat - honestly, you couldn't chew them and I was afraid that someone would choke on them so I put them away."}
{"text":"They are so rude over the phone. I had a simple question if they carried an item and I was placed on hold. After 20 mins of waiting I hung up and tried calling back in an hour. Always busy and when i got a hold of someone they hung up the phone on me. The next day i tried calling them I was transferred to four people. All of them had no clue what I was asking and its a simple product (especially since its a seafood place). Finally I gave up and asked if they have it and how much and they stated its against their policy to give out prices over the phone. I live clear across town and I just wanted to have a range in price and to see if they carried them. Jezzzz is that so much to ask?"}
{"text":"If you've been to one SC, you've been to all of them--and you know they're the walmart of Filipino/Oriental groceries stores. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. All the standards are there, from fresh-ish produce, to aisles of noodles and fish sauce. And the seafood department always has the fish you want--with the heads still on--at really good prices. Drop them off at the counter if you want them cleaned, filleted, etc. The parking lot is big but always busy, and full of truly bad drivers. So beware! There are also Chow King and Jollibee franchises inside for your Filipino fast food fix. In fact, if you're feeling homesick for your Filipino heritage (or just a Flip-phile), head on down to SC. Walk the aisles and you will eventually find some elderly folks that look or sound just like your Lola and Lolo. I swear I found my Dad's doppleganger in the skin whitening aisle. Anyway, if this stretch of Maryland Parkway is Las Vegas' Little Manila, then Seafood City is the Capitol."}
{"text":"I'm Japanese, so my seafood freshness standard is much higher than most, and for a store that calls itself \"seafood city\"....their seafood is NOT fresh or appetizing at all, and selection quite poor.    It's baffling how people can even buy fish from this place.  very disappointed."}
{"text":"Pretty basic Filipino market, all the usual selections here.  Not a real big variety of Chinese/Japanese vegetables.  Lots of canned food, and some stuff you won't find on the Spring Mountain side of the 15.  Very full seafood selection.  Crowded on a Saturday.  Armed guards."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but I can't eat this place's food ..  This is not about flesh or not .... I got octopus and some seafood ...  And octopus was totally rotten ...  I'm Japanese I never seen smelly seafood and soooooo shock ..  I need go to Japanese grocery even tho price is 5x more expensive ...."}
{"text":"Asians unite! Pinoy power! If you love anything asian this is the place for you! Jollibee and chow king are located within seafood city. Tons of asian influenced foods and gadgets a like."}
{"text":"I love this place! Best place to buy meats and sea food. Always fresh and prices r excellent"}
{"text":"We just spent $4 on salted eggs that turned out to be boiled eggs. When I called to complain, they just said that they can't take a return without a receipt. What snakes. What a joke. They try to nickel and dime people. Also- the cashier over charged us for green onions. We were surprised that they cost so much so we said take it out, we don't want it. Then she realized \"Oh I charged you 3 instead of 2\".. We still didn't get it cuz it was so expensive. But she doesn't even be careful to check what ppl are buying - just guessing what ppl are buying!? Stupid. I like this place cuz it's clean but they seem like snakes. It also took us 35 minutes to get our fish fried. We told them to check on our order. I was watching them for at least 10 minutes. Our order happened to be sitting at the frier!! I watched them pick one out of the frier and set it next to another order that has been sitting there! The one sitting there was ours! 35 mins! Wow! Get it together! Expensive and! What he hell is the point of cheating people out of salted eggs?! Just make them right! Are you really that cheap? Lazy? Or what is it?! Very sad."}
{"text":"I was pretty so-so about this place before. I think the dirty Walmart reference is dead on. However it is pretty convenient if you live on the east side. What really turned me against them though is when my disabled brother went in (he can't really travel too far) and the kicked him out b/c he had his (marked) service dog w/ him. Apparently they were quite rude about it too. Not only that they waited until he was half way through his shopping. To be honest I thought we were beyond this discrimation already"}
{"text":"A wide selection of snacks, food, drinks, and seafood, all at good prices."}
{"text":"I just got off the phone with them to find out how much it costs for lobster per lb.  They absolutely refused to tell me.  I told them I live all the way on the West side, and with the cost of gas at $3 per gallon, can't they tell me the price?  They said no...it's their policy not to give prices over the phone.  When I called all these other supermarkets they obliged."}
{"text":"I can't complain this place definitely had it going on with the diversity it offered. I felt like I traveled to an international destination. This place had arrival different places to eat and dine. I was very surprised to see there own fried chicken establishment that even had selections of noodle bowls. I was very impressed with that alone as I walked through the doors.  I have this problem with always being hungry before shopping and I end up buying more than I really need. So that to me was a plus,plus! The dining and other amenities as a small boutique was a nice touch to give this place a Real MarketPlace feel.   The only reason why I'm giving this place three stars and not more was because I happen to go tour this place on one of the most busiest days anyone could ever go.  The female shoppers were looking upside my head..Idk why maybe because of my striking gorgeous looks...lol..or just giving me the stanky eye..lol.. Either way I'm all about peace and happiness so it didn't matter. I love all people! I hope the loving smile I had givin in return brighten their journey. :-D  Besides that I asked an employee where a certain product was and he said \"Whhhaat! \" really loud , I felt I disrupted him. Other than that , I didn't get the chance to go to the seafood section for the crab legs I wanted to get, the line was pretty long.  However I will return to try for a better experience. I like this place, since it is closer than China town."}
{"text":"I love this place. The reason I give it 4 stars? The aisles are always blocked by boxes of inventory, and are soooo narrow (I can't tell you how many times I have had to back up out of an aisle just to look at something at the other end of it because someone couldn't move). Great selection of produce, meat, and Asian goodies and products, awesome hot food takeout area. Always excited to shop here."}
{"text":"Seafood City is a pretty good place to shop. There is an assortment of Filipino/Asian products without having to go to Chinatown. It lives up to its namesake and you'll find whole Yellowfin Tuna down to wild caught Oregon sardines. They also carry Filipino beers, Kewpie mayo, Filipino toiletries and magazines. It's a one-stop to the Philippines. Inside the shopping center, they have Pinoy franchises such as Jollibee, Chow King and Valerios Bakery. There is also an esthetician behind the Asian jewelry counter.  The location is centric; it's close to the Strip, airport and major streets. Inside, it is clean and the employees follow sanitation guidelines based on what I see. I have family in the culinary industry and pay attention to these things. The staff is okay; they are not overly friendly, but are not rude to us. Perhaps looking Pinoy helps, based on some reviews, which is unfortunate since this is business.   What kept me from giving the one-stop shop 5 stars are two things, one worse than the other. The groceries are fresh for the most part, but sometimes are not at peak freshness depending on the day one shows up. Fortunately, I do not have to trek too far or else I'd be upset.   Onto the bad thing about Seafood City. There are a few customers who cause trouble. A few weeks ago, we witnessed Africans fist fighting outside of the Jollibee section. They were hollering (maybe profanities) in their language. Although the police arrived, human detritus has come to shore at Seafood City. There are some vagrants who hang outside the store and parking lot who beg for money.   A few days ago, my mom encountered a rude male customer who was pushing her out of the way with his shopping cart and pushing his groceries ahead of hers while flailing his arms at her, thus creating physical contact. When she told him to stop and say \"excuse me\", he claimed that he couldn't tell whether she spoke English or not. Regardless of a customer's level of English literacy, everyone understands \"excuse me.\" Even recent Spanish speaking immigrants know and say \"excuse me\" with thick accents. My mother was about to move on, but saw the same man chatting and laughing with the nonchalant security guard about what he did to her. Mom told the security what the man did and that he should do his job and then pretended to scold the man.  I think I will have to consider going to Chinatown, even if the trip is further away."}
{"text":"I try to avoid this market unless its absolutely necessary. Not because the selection isn't great or because the staff isn't friendly. Its because its almost always overly busy!"}
{"text":"Good selection of seafood (hence the name right?). They have a lot of items not offered in other Asian markets. This place primarily caters to the Filipino community. Nice and clean with a great variety of fast food places."}
{"text":"Very very good quality produce at reasonable prices. Their fried fish is the business! A very good dried mushroom selection to make nice soups/stocks and healing broths. Lots of nice international snacks and sweets. They also have a pretty selection of beauty/bath/body products, as well as nice ointments to soothe the body. The staff are super professional hence customer service is top notch."}
{"text":"Excellent selection of seafood and very authentic Filipino and other Asia. Items. I live in Henderson and was searching for an Octopus to Cooke because I am a chef and someone outside of work wanted to make then an Octopus Tomato sauce. I wasn't sure where to go but after calling this location the person who answered the phone was very friendly and willing to help me. She let me know there was 1 octopus left and said she would hold it for me. As I was in there, the selections of shell fish and other fish was awesome. Being from Florida it is hard to find good seafood out here in Vegas so I was very impressed with some of their options. Whenever I am need of some fresh seafood or whole fish I will definitely be going back to this store. And a bonus they have a Jollibee in their supermarket. I have seen this fast food restaurant on many different shows and always wanted to try it, this place is a must go!"}
{"text":"When we purchased fish & asked to clean & fry them it was bloody & raw. I emailed them but no response. It's been three days now. As a paying customer we deserve an apology & a refund. Also some of their workers are rude especially if you're not Asian or at least look Asian. They talk about you in Tagalog not realizing many can understand what they're saying. Rude."}
{"text":"It's a love-hate relationship, i must say.  Love: if you love filipino goodies, this is the best place! They even sell stuff you can't even find somewhere else. It's where I pick up stuff that reminds me of HOME.  They have a large variety of seafood and meat here. their stuff tends to run out later on the day so its best to go shop earlier in the day. Fresh fish. Fresh seafoods. Even live crabs and lobsters. Playing with the live crabs makes me happy. There are fast food restaurants around the supermarket complex. Chowking, Red Ribbon and Jollibee. They sell fresh bread right nextdoor, Valerio's bakery. Open from 7am till midnight. Clean and organized.  Hate: Parking.  They do have really huge parking space, but since it's one of the biggest Filipino supermarket in town, people do come here a lot!! So go off hours. The distance on every registers are REALLY narrow. Even the shopping carts couldn't fit. The meat counter can be overwhelming, esp the line for fish cleaning. They can be a little too overpriced. You can find some of their exact stuff at Walmart or 99 Cents Store for about 2-3x cheaper.  I love you more than I hate you, so I'll keep visiting."}
{"text":"What can i say, Its Seafood City. The staple of filipino americans trying to get some authentic back home flavor.. I mean this place even has a built in Jollibee and Chow King! Being married to a Filipina for nearly 10 years and having visited the Philippines many times i can see why this place is so popular. Get there when they open if your trying to buy fish because it gets picked over very fast. Also get ready to wait in line at the cashier, they usually only have 2 or 3 cashiers and hundreds of customers. Its not exactly the SM Grocery store.."}
{"text":"I love this place. So far, I am not disappointed with this place. I have been a few times and gotten what I wanted. I have bought kimchi, coco jam, and other things. I like it so much that I took Grandma with me one day and she loved it. We like it because we can get fresh seafood, different meat, veggies, fruits, just about anything. They even have restaurants such as Jollibee. The restaurant has excellent food. This is a definite place to do your grocery shopping and great food to eat."}
{"text":"This is the one stop shop for all the ingredients needed for Filipino dishes. I love coming here for their meats because its so cheap."}
{"text":"Great store to shop for Filipino food. Fresh seafoods are priced reasonably. Cashiers are friendly wearing friendly smiles. Chowking and Red Ribbon in the vicinity is"}
{"text":"We went to this shop because my husband noticed it one day. What a FABULOUS place  We went 10-21-17 planning my birthday dinner fresh lobster and crab ;) everyone that understood English was helpful. Hopefully they will get a few more English speaking workers so communication isn't so irritating. We ended up having to look a few things up online as to how long our fresh shell fish would be ok."}
{"text":"Live crabs in barrels! Whole fish! Gross weird things I have never seen!  I love this market. i used to live down the street and loved to pick up some yummy fishes and all sorts of noodles and whatever Asian spices smelled perfect for the night.  I had no idea what i was doing half the time but the ingredients made themselves.  The fish was all fresh and the whole store interesting. I don't think I am a fan of boba. I love this store I love this store. I love this store."}
{"text":"Being that i'm originally from Hawaii, you can go anywhere for asian groceries.  But now living in Las Vegas, there are some small stores here & there but this store by far, I think would be the best for asian groceries! Very good prices especially w/ the veggies & fruits. Fresh seafoods & I now go here for my meats as well.  This store has been my one stop shop for asian stuff.  LOVE IT!!"}
{"text":"This store not only has fresh seafood but a variety of meats available! It's a fully stocked supermarket so most likely you will find almost everything you are looking for! From live blue crab to oxtails and more this place is definitely worth taking a trip too."}
{"text":"Good place for groceries live crabs and fish.  Hard to pay for stuff.Friday nite and 3 registers open"}
{"text":"I bought salmon recently. It's fresh, delicious and price is good. Big parking, actually it's not just seafood supermarket. It's ASIAN Seafood Supermarket. You can find various Asian food, vegetables, noodles, sweets etc."}
{"text":"This supermarket is always busy, it's like Filipino town. They have fresh produce, fresh seafood, meat, and frozen food section. On a budget you can pretty much buy a lot of Asian ingredients and make food at home. There is an aisle for noodles, rice, all kinds of sauce, canned goods, snacks, and drinks. Mainly I come here just for coconut water, skin care beauty products, and the food. Just an FYI, the store can get a bit crowded around lunch hour with people's carts being so close in proximity, and the lines do get very long but if you have the patience to wait, that's great!  On this recent visit, I picked a couple of sweet tasty dessert: Biko Ube ($3.89) and Biko Langka ($3.89). You can find a variety of premade Filipino dessert near the check out. I prefer the Biko Langka, it is a personal favorite treat made with sweet sticky rice, coconut milk, shredded coconut, brown sugar, and it has jackfruit. The Biko Ube taste okay, it has a purple food coloring but I didn't feel like it has any ube flavor, it's only sweet rice. Nonetheless the best way to enjoy Biko is to heat it one minute in the microwave and it comes out nice, soft, warm, and yummy."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Seafood city because my filipino wife loves to get all her fish, and Philippine foods there...Seems like were always there when there stocking the shelves as boxes and workers seem to be always in the way...The fish market is closed in the evening as well...In the fruit and vegetable section they seem to have flies that are harvesting somewhere in the area...I think from the nasty smelling jackfruit...There prices on the seafood are decent, the other crap is over priced...I have a hard time spending less than a $100 every time I come here...Sometimes there music that is played in the store is super loud!"}
{"text":"Love this store.... better than Ranch 99. It use to be that I went to Ranch 99 because it was the only place to get all you asian cuisine items (versus little mom/ pop filipino shops that might not having everything you are looking for). I believe that Seafood City here in Las Vegas is much cleaner than the ones I have seen in CA (granted they are like a VONS in CA). We only have one here in Vegas.  So as far as other Seafood City markets go, this is a nice clean one. I don't think it smells as bad as Ranch 99 either."}
{"text":"Alright: I totally get it that I showed up thirty minutes before they're closing but really?!? REALLYYY... Attitude from EVERYONE. It would be one thing if this were a restaurant, but I am literally running in to grab ONE thing. ONE item! That was it. It wasn't like i was going to spend FIVE FREAKING HOURS keeping everyone: Trust me, I know how it feels to be kept waiting in a restaurant after hours: Especially from my own kind, and other asians who think they can just keep you three hours after we've already closed, but thats another essay.  I get the death stare from everyone: Even these two teenagers sitting in Jolibees who looked as if they just got off or it is their \"spot\" to hang and ONLY THEY CAN KEEP PEOPLE WAITING. Literally kept staring at me like they wanted to gut me or something... Ignoring them, I proceeded directly to the item I needed, and this elder lady working the cashier immediately goes on the intercom and says \"WE ARE CLOSING IN ONE MINUTE!\" I ignored her for it was literally only thirty minutes in. Sign says, \"closed at twelve.\" I got in literally by 11:30pm and as I recall: there has been many of times that I've visited this place specifically for jolibees and they still got people shopping by 11:40-ish... mean while i'm done and out...  Anyways, she proceeds to repeat the same thing and waves me down shouting, \"hurry up!\" Signaling me to rush over to the register. As she cashes me out she too gave me a mean crippling stare and then mutters under her breath as if I don't know she's talking mad sh*t.   Forgive my language but it is times like this that i get so upset when people are rude for no reason. I get you want to go home because closing hours are near, but since when is it okay to treat people like that? I wish I could at my job."}
{"text":"I'm a 100% filipino descendant kind of person so I love having a nearby filipino store to feel comfortable in case I'm craving some authentic sweats, treats, and products!  Seafood City Market has a lot of merchandise and produce. They have isles of your filipino snacks, noodles, cooking items, balikbayan boxes, goods, etc. they have a fruit and vegetable section, frozen food section, meats and seafood sections as well! They also have beauty/skincare products at the front. This place has almost everything a filipino could ask for. You also have you're popular filipino vendors such as Jollibee, Chow King, Red Ribbon, and Valerio'e bakery in the store at the front!   I like coming here because of Jollibee for the most part or for whenever I feel like cooking pancit or getting a few road trip snacks! Lol they also have a mini salon, to go phone stand/at&t kiosk, and a small clothing shop as well.   This store is located just down Maryland parkway from the UNLV campus so it's convenient for me. I don't know where else you can find a filipino market this big in Vegas but this would be the spot when you're lookin for anything filipino!  The only reason I wouldn't give this 5 stars is mostly because most of the times the workers are filipino and it creates a language barrier with some of their strong accents. Also I don't know if it's just me or if they're always restocking everything when I'm there, it becomes a little claustrophobic in the isles. But at least they keep the store clean! Lol"}
{"text":"I appreciate the friendly service that the employee's offer.  And how they keep stations NEAT.  But i dislike the fact that the registers are so crowded, and that there is no cart rack on the side of the building where 40+ cars park. That leads to so much carts being scattered all over the parking spaces."}
{"text":"The good things about Seafood City are that it's interesting, clean and bright.  I especially liked the seafood department.  The fish were just beautiful to look at.  They also had mutton and goat meat today.  I've always wanted to try mutton....The reason I didn't rate it higher was that they didn't have as many interesting things in the other areas of the store.  The produce section was nice, but a little unremarkable.  The frozen foods and grocery areas just didn't have as much unusual stuff as either 99 Ranch or Diho Market."}
{"text":"I went to grab some potstickers at 11:45. The sign out front said open, I went to the doors and they wouldn't open....I thought maybe they were broken so I opened them easily with my hands. I walked in and got almost to the isle, and security said excuse me miss we are closed! I said 15 minutes early?! Your sign says you close at midnight! The cashier was already done counting and closing out her till! Absolutely the most unprofessional and rude establishment I've ever been in. LAZY AND RUDE! If I could give a negative star I would but the lowest is 1!!!!! Will never give them my business again...I suggest everyone do the same."}
{"text":"I tired to contact seafood city directly, but all my attempts failed. This is about your security guard on 7/9/16 at 8:30 pm. He's an average sized black man. You need to fire this guy before he shoots someone. He clearly has mental issues. I went into your store to buy a couple of onions. They were over priced and rotten. I decided to go over to 99 ranch market next door. As I'm walking out he's staring at me intently and then follows me out of the store.  Since when is it a crime not to buy anything? I turned on my video phone and recorded the whole thing. Look for it on Youtube!! The whole time he was talking to me he had his hand on his gun like he was ready to draw it at anytime. I was unarmed and a fragile woman. God only knows what his intentions were. He kept asking if I was alright. Once he realized I was filming him, he backed off. I guess with all the racial tension of late he's ready to shoot someone. I'll guess he doesn't like Filipino's!"}
{"text":"Unbelievably Slow and inefficient service.  Casher line is often piled up for long waiting. They don't even say \"hi\" to the custmer although the stuffs are always talking each other.   Vegetable deal is very good- the only reason I go here."}
{"text":"Fun place! It was happening in here. Loved the food stands out serving fishballs on sticks. They were fun and yummy especially kid approved. Not sure the cleanliness of it all but fun to peruse and pick out some snacky funky treats.   A local friend of ours came with us and recommended Grill city to try. She got some yummy looking chicken at Chicken joy and to go noodles from Chow king. We need to come back to try all that.   The whole concept of being able to get halo halo anywhere was too fun. She recommends halo halo at the dessert shop so we need to hit there. We got some cakes from Red ribbon, wasn't wow like we hoped but thinking we need to try other stuff next time and shop a bit more.   Love seeing new places and usually go to ranch 99 or hmart where it's Korean owned or other Chinese or Vietnamese markets but to have a Filipino one? So cool!!"}
{"text":"I wish they have more help at the meat department.  There's only person minding the counter."}
{"text":"This is our favorite place for cheap seafood stock up before our road trip back to SLC.   They have a lot of fish varieties, half of them I don't even know they exist. Note that most of them are previously frozen but fully thawed. I grabbed whole Black Promfet for 3.99/lbs, Tilapia for 2.48/lbs and Catfish for 2.99/lbs, which are a steal compared to the price in SLC. They provide plastic gloves for you to touch the fish. Bring what you want to the weighing station and let them know if you want the fish cleaned and how you want them cut. They have fresh lobster, crabs and oysters too. I just wish we had bigger ice box to fit stuff in the car for the long ride home. Cleanliness wise, not the cleanest but comparable to any Asian based supermarkets.  I wish we have store like this back home."}
{"text":"Fresh fried fish from the seafood counter and a cold San Miguel from the refrigerator- it's like the Filipino version of fish tacos and a Corona, at least for me. Those are my staple purchases, along with whatever catches my eye in the produce department. Love how they clean and prepare your fish to go.  This store is surprisingly clean considering the lack of service- then again, the brusque attitude and lack of regard for others is also practiced by the customers as well. Go in knowing old ladies will cut in front of you, no one will make eye contact, and people will straight up walk into you without saying a word, and you should be fine.  Come here for Filipino staples, cheap meats, and the self-service fish counter. Do not come here for American brands (Doritos are priced double). I appreciate how they have gloves and hand sanitizer around for customer use, but no one seems to use it?  Always treat yourself to a meal or snack before or after your visit- the food court area has several quick spots (the jokes about ChowKing write themselves), but a cold sweet treat from Magnolia is my usual pick."}
{"text":"Love that seafood city is near me! This is definitely where I go when I need some ingredients for my Asian (especially Filipino) recipes whenever I want to make myself something that's takes me back home. Everyone is kind and they always have everything I need PLUS they're open TIL midnight, including the restaurants!! Woohoooo"}
{"text":"I asked if the Dungeness Crab was fresh at $9.99/pound ...they said yes.  They lied ...totally frozen ...full of water which made the crab heavier and cost more ....two crab for 27 bucks!  a total ripoff.  Also the crab was frozen in a salted brine ....when you cleaned them...much of the crab was mush and unedible due to overpowering salt taste.  This was after I made a crab salad with a honey mustard dressing.  Horrible ...I later found FRESH crab at Vons nearby for 6.99 a pound. It may look like a nice store but after throwing away 27 bucks I will not be back."}
{"text":"i vacationed in the Philippines a lot when I was younger, and have spent a lot of my life in Asian/Filipino markets in California..  seafood city is all that I remember about those specific markets and more.  it's totally hooked up with all your filipino/asian needs and kept bright and clean.  I come here mostly because it's hard to find fresh veggies, meats, and seafood for cheap at local american markets.  i also go here to buy rice and pick up all the indigenous ingredients for my culturally indigenous foods. ;)    come through  if u need to send things door to door, swoop up a pinoy pride shirt,  pacqiao trinkets, santo nino's, skin whitening or papaya soap.. [lol]  you can even hang out with all the peoples chillin!  grab a bite to eat at chow king or jolly bee.. or hit up red ribbon for dessert!  haha.. this is a monthly trip for me cause it's far.. but if it were closer i'd be picking up my meat and veggies from seafood city every week."}
{"text":"I think your store in Las Vegas needs some personnel improvements specifically in your fish department This department has a substandard speed and lacking in good communication skills. Your store is over staff but also you have lousy workers that are either old or lazy and has no speed. My wife went there this afternoon to buy fish and requested it fried. Forty minutes later the fish is still  not done. A fish department employee told my wife that they are ready for frying and will take another 15 to 20 minutes. My wife left the store mad and unhappy and did not wait for the fish.  Paging Caloy of Seafood Management to check on this problem. Your store success is something you owe to your clients. You need to perform your best to make this customers stay or they will go somewhere. Never think that you are already big and you can do everything."}
{"text":"It's always packed when we go here, which I guess should be seen as a good sign. It takes a while to check out, but in any busy place that can be expected.   I drop in here from time to time when I want to make egg rolls and need bean sprouts as they are usually the only place near me where I can find them. This past time they were not in stock and literally 90% of the items I looked at in the produce section were moldy and turning. No thank you. I'll reserve this location for when I am desperate for sprouts.  I'd rather spend more in gas and go to the A Mart in commercial center or up to Greenland and get actual fresh produce."}
{"text":"This place was good until it was well known in the asian community. You have to fight for a parking spot. It's waay crowded, the employees have somewhat of a lack of communication.  The positives of this place, it reminds me of home...the palenke (however you spell it) smell. The fish you can inspect yourself for freshness (I am picky when it comes to fish). Also I like the fact they can clean and cook it for you (for those who are always on the run)."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service sat in the store for 2 hours for a return rude employees didn't want to help me took the supervisor to come out to basically give me what I want so I can leave your store horrible horrible customer service I will never ever return to that store again in my life"}
{"text":"Seafood City is a grocery store that is located in Maryland Parkway just off Flamingo is one of many franchises that cater specifically to the Filipino community but also other Asian and ethnic cultures.  Fairly big in size with neighbors such as Jollibee, Chow King, & Valerios Bakery rented directly in the facility...it makes it a convenient one stop shop for your Filipino needs.  You can pretty much find it all in here.  Highly advertised on the Filipino Channel, especially in California...Seafood City is like the Filipino version of Vons or Safeway...well known but can be a little highly priced on some items.  Plenty of fresh fish and vegetables to choose from.  Staff for the most part are friendly and can help you locate what you are looking for.  Shelves are continuously being stocked which is nice to see.    The downside is that, this place gets crowded, especially on weekends and Holidays!  Parking is a pain in the @$$, but upon availability it is alright.  The parking lot is big, it is just that this place gets so packed it can get ridiculous.  I suggest getting there early or off hours to ease the tension.    Over all it is nice place to go to, but if you are not a people person or hate crowds...you might want to head over to China Town or other asian/oriental markets around the valley instead."}
{"text":"Very nice Filipino supermarket, they have everything you could ever want. Nice selections of fresh vegetables and seafood. Very clean and No bad fish smell in air, have been in a lot of Vietnamese supermarket that has stink fish smell in the air. Located in the same area of the supermarket, they have a lot of Filipino food choices to choose from like Jollibee, Chowking etc. check this place out you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We just love asian stores.  We are able to find most stuff we need here and the bakery outside is awesome."}
{"text":"Great seafood selection at reasonable prices; fresh looking squid, salmon, shrimp, whole tropical fish, octopus, baby octopus, and a large selection of frozen fish and shell-fish. On top of that, they have a large and usually quite busy meat counter, packaged meat section [including marinated pork belly], fresh seaweed salad [a personal favorite- I can eat tons of it at a time], lots of frozen dumplings, gyoza, lumpia, imported fruit, etc. Lots of fresh fruits and vegetables, too, which might be hard to find anywhere else including taro, banana blossoms, and a wide variety of chiles. Lots of dried/salted/seasoned fish & fishballs/sausages, chicken and quail eggs, masago, tofu, and tons of sauces, teas, chips, candies, and kitchen equipment. Parking can be ridiculous sometimes, and having been the only white girl in the area I've gotten some intense stares- but nothing too uncomfortable or weird. I don't know enough about philipino cooking to utilize everything in the store, but I've found things I recognize and enjoy but might not find frequently - daifuku for one. Cheap sake and tasty beer [Red Horse] don't hurt, either. Interesting and useful resource to have in the Vegas valley!"}
{"text":"Great Asian Store in bad location. Too many homeless' in the parking lot  and by front of store begging for money or cigarettes."}
{"text":"Love all the seafood, snacks, and those BBQ chicken skewers.  Great price for seafood deserve my 5 stars."}
{"text":"Great variety of well circulated food items. I skip the food court. The fish market is what brings me back again and again. Sometimes the men that work in the fish section are mean because it's not like I know what I'm doing. I tough it out and it's worth it. The fish is a good price. One time i asked for two live lobsters and they simply put them in grocery bag with a sticker on it. They totally could have crawled around my car. It all worked out though and they were delicious. I do have to say that the parking lot is very scary. People drive badly and nearly run you over. Also many homeless asking for money."}
{"text":"-yay! they have one here -was searching for ice cream -didn't feel like having boba/halo-halo from red ribbon or jollibee -didn't scope out the store much but it did appear to be the same size as the one in union city -still no overpowering fish smell -no scoops of ice cream but found mochi balls -inline, got the slowest clerk....she needed to retire but she was so sweet -\"magandang hapon po...\" i said (good afternoon) -\"ay, pilipina ka pala, akala ko hindi\" (oh, i didn't think you were filipina) =\"MAITIM KASI \"(cuz i'm dark) AS SHE GIGGLES AND TAKES A YEAR TO WRAP UP"}
{"text":"After a recent trip to Las Vegas, I already planned to visit the local Jollibee and was surprised to see it being housed in the food court of Seafood City. A friend and I spent an afternoon in the area just walking around, I absolutely loved this place we had to come back a second time. At first glance it's just your typical Asian market but I was super excited to find out that it focused on Filipino products. The food court alone is a homesick Pinoy's dream. The supermarket has a Jollibee, Chow King, Red Ribbon, and Magnolia ice cream shop (makes halo halo and has classic Filipino ice cream flavors like my favorite queso!) and even a couple of family owned Filipino restaurants that I wish I would've tried. While walking around I found some personal favorite beauty products such as Eskinol and whitening deodorant. This was such a great alternative and cheap place to dine compared to the overpriced places on the Strip. Really felt at home here and I was glad to discover this place while visiting Vegas!"}
{"text":"Up until recently, I'd avoided Seafood City because I don't eat seafood. I'd go to the Barnes and Noble next door (RIP) or eat at Jason's Deli, but I'd skip the City.  I decided to see what veggies and other delicacies they had. I was pleasantly surprised by the range of produce, and I was ecstatic at the dozen or more varieties of tofu offered. They also had tiny citrus trees for sale, which is awesome.  I ended up with veggies, seaweed and tofu, all at excellent prices. I'll definitely be going back for more."}
{"text":"Visiting my parents we decided to go here.  Now I live outside of Santa Rosa, California, about an hour and a half north of San Francisco.  I can't find any remotely decent Asian restaurants/markets around here.  They have everything Filipino/Asian under the sun that any Island boy or girl could want.  This place is awesome and I will make it a point to drop by here every time I visit my parents."}
{"text":"Good selection of filipino items and of course seafood. They have mostly anything you need thats asian. I used to go here a couple times a week when i lived in vegas because it was right down the street. I sure miss this place."}
{"text":"Want to go fishing? Can't afford a boat? Or a rod.. or bait..oh no, you live in the desert!! This place is awesome for all my fish needs."}
{"text":"This place is freakin' BUSY. Amando S. made homemade Ahi Poke on St. Patrick's Day so since then I was CRAVING it!! I took a journey to Seafood City to pick up some Ahi Poke. Good prices for some slabs of Tuna! This was really all I came here for so I had my tuna and was waiting in line... lalalala - then a sales associate said since I had so few items, I could go through the customer service line. Yes! Short line. Plus they make money orders there for fifty cents and I actually needed one. SCORE."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now. It is a nice clean supermarket with a lot of variety in asian foods. I'm giving it a low 2 star based on a very rude service I received and was very turned off by it. I called a few different supermarkets to inquire about oysters and prices. All had given me answers except seafood city! When I called seafood city the lady that answered the phone told me she can not give prices over the phone. So rude! I never heard such a thing! If she is an employee providing good service she should be more helpful in trying to help their customers! A big fail in my eyes! What she should have done was to find out the price so she could have potential customer come there to shop and give them business, not shut their customers down! I will not return due to the bad service!"}
{"text":"This is the best place to buy fresh fish. It has a vast selection and it is easy to purchase. It is not for the squeamish.   You must use the plastic \"mitten\" to pick up your fish and put them in a plastic bag. Then, you take the fish up to the counter and it is weighed. If you want the fish cleaned and cut they will do that there.   It is primarily a Phillipino market. If you need Phillipino specific sauces, spices, etc. this is the place.  Another bonus, if you play Pokemon Go, this is the place to catch rare water Pokemon. The store and parking lot are full of them!"}
{"text":"Sells everything asian particularly filipino made products. Its like heaven when you walk in here shopping going thru each and every aisle looking for what to buy. The fresh seafood area has a huge selection and they have an add on service where they can cook your fish."}
{"text":"Great spot for fresh seafood. I feel a lil out of place there as most of the clientele is Asian, but great spot. If u want good food at reasonable price, go here. Got some nice blue crabs        Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"}
{"text":"I've to say I expected better from this big corporation but it failed my expectations.  First of all I bought a parrot fish roughly 3 lbs and had them clean it. The wait was hefty but I will excuse that because I understand they were busy. But the thing is I took that fish home and baked it in the oven well over the recommend time and my family got sick!! I'm no ametuer about cleaning nor cooking fish, I was raised on a island most of my life. Anyways, I also noticed the seafood area didn't look like it had alot of care taken into it. Most of the fish was smelly, like old smelly. Even I know when it starts smelling and the eyes get glassy you should remove it from the selling area. The last thing that somewhat irritated me was the cashier was talking in tagalog the whole time to the other cashier in the next lane. She didn't even greet me, tell me my total or even say thank you. I've been to most of the asian markets and even the cashiers that don't speak English try show me some manners and smile. I don't believe I will be going here EVER again!"}
{"text":"Let me start this review by saying that you don't have to be Asian to shop here! A few of my coworkers asked me if I can get some things for them. I asked them why couldn't they get it themselves? They replied with \"We are not Asian and they might treat us differently\". I should of been offended right? Nope. Instead I said, \"They will only treat you different if you act like jerks so don't be one and you'll be ok.\"  Seafood City is similar to 99 Ranch but caters more to the Filipino population. If you have ever eaten at a Filipino restaurant, this is where you will find most if not all the ingredients in all the dishes you eat.   I come here for all sorts of things like different flavored chips, nuts, biscuits, crackers, etc. Drinks like coconut juice. mango juice, calamansi juice, etc.   Basically, a lot of items you just cant find at your basic Smith's or Albertsons. What is also great is the location of this place. If you get hungry there is a Chow King and a Jollibee just right in front where you enter.  The layout of their place is nice also. All the way to the right you have all your vegetables. All the way to the back you have all your refrigerated items. All the way to the left are all the seafood/meat items along with the frozen section. In between you have all the aisles with all the little things I mentioned in my 3rd paragraph.  Service is actually above average. They usually have enough people on registers so that long lines are virtually non existent. Most of the time each cashier has their own assistant that bags all the merchandise you just bought.   So for those non Asians, just relax and shop just like you would at any other supermarket. Sometimes its ok to shop somewhere different. You never know, you just might find something you really like here."}
{"text":"I've got mixed feelings about Seafood City.  What I like: They've got Magnolia Coconut Ice Cream Bars. Sure other Asian stores have them, but their are always in stock and reasonably priced. They usually have a goodly amount of steamed cheesecake onhand. I love this little Japanese dessert because it is nice and light and not too sweet. I don't have to make a separate purchase at Red Ribbon cause they have the mamon sponge cake in store as well. And lastly my mom usually finds all her beloved Filipino ingredients.  What I dislike: It's crowded. Ugh. The store is always packed. I don't think I have ever been there at a time when it wasn't filled with people. If I wanted to willingly subject myself to agoraphobia I'd just go to Walmart on a Saturday at 10 a.m.  And the parking lot is crowded as well. Sometimes I feel sorry for those people who just want to go to Jason's Deli. And of course the smell. Sometimes I can ignore it or it's not too bad, but other times the fish smell is overwhelming.  All in all, this is a great place if you are shopping for Filipino foodstuffs. I usually only get over to it if I am on a shopping trip with my mom. I think one of the biggest draws for me is visiting Chow King for a mango shake - but that is an entirely different review."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  We were able to get everything we needed and then some, during our stay in Vegas.  We always like to get a case or 2 of water and snacks for the hotel room. Love how it reminded me of many of the Asian Marts back in NJ. It was like a Filipino version of Mitsuwa!  What I really loved was the Filipino BBQ spot and the Filipino crispy food spot located inside. Good pork and chicken BBQ, with lots of meat on the stick, and that Filipino sweetness that I am so familiar with. Just like home!  What I loved even more was finding crispy chicken skin!  Soooooo goooood!  You have to buy it by the pound. And it's really crispy. Not too salty like other ones I have had back in NJ, but it was still great!  There are other eateries, so it's nice to have a variety of menus to choose from. My one and only complaint is that they had so many different types of Skyflakes (a popular brand of crackers in the Philippines). Think if it as a fancy Saltines cracker. They even had a flavor I've never seen before: chicken?!? My husband swears they're good. But they did NOT have the condensed milk/sweet flavor. Despite my disappoint in this, it was still a great shopping trip. I'm sure we will be back again before we leave Vegas. It's not too far from the strip, but you do need a car to get here. It was about a 10 minute drive. Definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Nice selection of items but there needs to some more shopping carts around so people can  buy more things instead of buying only a few items and the cashiers need to smile more often"}
{"text":"Great place for Filipino fast food and if you need some groceries while you're out of town"}
{"text":"Such a waste, 930 pm and place is open till 12am. Came thru for... You guessed it SEAFOOD and that part was closed. \"I got a jar of oysters\" the dude said. I wanted fresh seafood hence why I drove across town. Unless you are Asian or more specifically Philipino then don't waste your time. Poor customer service."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go to a Seafood City. For those who are not familiar with Seafood city, it's a grocery store similar to a 99 ranch, h-mart, Assi etc. but Seafood city is a Filipino grocery store. They're located more on the west coast in states like California and Washington and of course in Nevada. They carry all kinds of Filipino products as well as other Asian products but here they have 10 different kinds of tocino brands, lumpias, ice creams etc. They have a couple of tables filled with Filipino ready to eat snacks/desserts (kakanin), they even played Tagalog music! I was in heaven. As if I wasn't already excited by all of that, inside the Seafood city was Jollibee, Chow King and Red Ribbon, all popular Filipino restaurant and bakery chain!! But it gets better (well for me anyways), I was able to find my all time favorite fruit there that I haven't eaten in years and seen here in the US... Lanzones. I was exstatic!! We were in Vegas for 4 1/2 days and we went to seafood city 3 or 4 times to eat and get snacks.   Tip: if you go here, check out Valerio's Topical bakeshop next door. They have amazing baked goods. Actually for Non Filipinos that go here check out Jollibee,  Chow King & Red ribbon as well for delicious food!"}
{"text":"One of my faves groceries store. Make sure you go to the back of the store to get the $.99 cents coconut milk. The front ones costs more. Just a tip."}
{"text":"Seafood City is a great place to grab ingredients for you typical Asian/Filipino dishes. Adding to they're variety of Asian/Filipino foods they also have a grocery like any other Neighborhood Walmart would.  Definitely a good place to do some grocery shopping. Prices are average facilities are clean and order, they also have a Jollibee, Chow King, and Red Ribbon in the same store if you get hungry."}
{"text":"A grocery store with restaurants inside the facility, nice customer service, good quality of foods the reason why I always go here."}
{"text":"So many selections, especially the seafood department. They also carry magnolia ice cream! Ube......delicious"}
{"text":"This is part of a chain of markets.  They seem to specialize in Filipino foods in particular, but there is a variety of other stuff.  Plus mostly fresh seafood (I mean, this is Vegas...there is no ocean...but it still seems pretty fresh).  Plus lots of grocery items for the Asian/Filipino recipes you want to do.  Patis, bagoong, sauce for Filipino spaghetti, etc, etc.  Overall, a good market."}
{"text":"Eh. I don't love this food store. It smells pretty bad. It also doesn't seem like it has the best selection of anything. There are no scallops either. Plus they don't de-bone their salmon."}
{"text":"They offer fresh seafood and all kinds of Filipino/Asian items n ingredients. even seasonal fruits from the Philippines like lansones, rambutan n many more. 4 stars coz it's somewhat pricey.    Their is definitely something for everybody."}
{"text":"Its like a mini filipino town. Love it. Love jollibee also."}
{"text":"The checkout lines were ridiculous. They open only one more then to shut down another. Waited for over 20 mins."}
{"text":"Consumer beware with regards to what price you see posted vs the price rung by the cashier...it is most often incorrect and if you are not attentive, you would be charged more than what you saw posted.  Always check the expiry dates of what you grab since they do not remove expired food items on the shelves."}
{"text":"the worst exchange policy,i was not asking for money, just grab the wrong product.just wanted to exchange it.the maneger was rude and was not there to make anyone happy"}
{"text":"As mentioned in other reviews, this place can get really busy. The place was swarming with asians. The only white person in the whole place was my wife. They've got a wide variety of stuff you'd never find at Smith's or Vons. Fruits and veggies that I've never even heard of and a lot of their produce (the stuff that you have heard of) is much cheaper than at the big name grocery stores. If you're looking for asian ingredients this is the place to go. The seafood section is like something straight out of San Francisco -- piles and piles of whole fish and crabs on ice. It's not something that you would expect to find in Vegas. If you love to cook (especially seafood) it's worth a visit."}
{"text":"This grocery store is good for those of you needing filipino food supplies. The 50LBS of Jasmin Rice is cheap and the food selections are wonderful. I do however recommend if you dont speak Tagalog then bring someone with you that does."}
{"text":"Love this store, lots of selections. Always busy.  I gave a 2 stars because the workers there playing favorite, if you speak their native language (Tagalog) you can cut the lines, I am not a Phillipino so I don't speak the language, I feel discriminated. You have to take a number on meat section but it means nothing, the worker will skip your# and help the person who have whatever# they want to help. It happened to me multiple times. I was standing right there, waiting for my# to be called."}
{"text":"Getting to prepare Filipino meals require Filipino ingredients. To eat Filipino food, get Filipino supplies, cook it Filipino way, cater or succumb to take-out ready-made food. Not just Filipino items are available in this supermarket but Thai, Japanese, Malaysian or other Asian fare. A large supermarket with fresh vegetables, rice, canned foods, beverages, soups, fruits, eggs, frozen food, ice cream, cookware, rice cookers, hair & beauty supplies, meats, live & fresh seafood is a shopper's delight. \"Balut\" or the well-known Filipino delicacy of duck-with-embryo-egg is available as well as quail eggs.(\"Balut\" is eaten best with salt and lemon juice and pairs well with a beer (\"cerveza\")). Recently, the addition of a Fish Fryer offers your fresh seafood fried and ready for you to take home without the cleaning and cooking tasks needed when you get home. There is a line at the Seafood section as fish is at a low affordable price and the fish frying is a great convenience. You will find this in the left side of the supermarket upon passing through the passageway next to the cash registers. The fresh produce of fruits and vegetables is on the right side of the supermarket.  Adjacent to the supermarket entry is \"Chow King\" also offers hot meals, soups, hot taho, ube or pandan smoothies and combination meals of chicken, meat or fish. Also, \"Jollibee\" is a fast food joint where Filipino style Spaghetti (which I must warn you is on the sweetness in taste), burgers, fries, mini sandwiches and munch on a Filipino style fried chicken called \"Chicken Joy\". A Beauty Salon called \"Monet\" for your haircut and beauty needs. \"Red Robbin Bakeshop\" offers breads, cakes, pastries and hot meals.   Restrooms are in \"Chow King\" and in \"Jollibee\". Read about latest local and international Filipino news from a variety of newsmagazines and newspapers stocked in newspaper bins by the sliding doors to the supermarket. Parking lot is accessible and this clean supermarket stays open from 7 a.m. to 12 p.m.   Communicating in English with Filipino attendants, servers and staff is not like being in a foreign land. Take time to browse around and ask questions from helpful supermarket associates if you are unfamiliar of Filipino or Asian supplies and viands."}
{"text":"Great produce selection, both common (apples, oranges, tomatoes,etc.) to the more uncommon and exotic(jackfruit, durian, lychee, dragonfruit)  Like you can find everything for a house at Home Depot, you can find everything you need here to throw a Filipino Fiesta!  I usually just shop here for Filipino dessert ingredients and hardly anything perishable because when we make a stop here, we're out and about and not on the way home....ALOHA!!!"}

{"text":"i love this seafood market!! it is so clean everytime we come here and the produce and seafood is super fresh!!! the misc. little restaurants located inside look really yummy too, however we havent had a chance to try out anything other than the ice cream place called magnolias ice cream treats... what really got my attention was the bright/vibrant colors of all the ice creams.  we initally got 2scoops of mango bc i was apprehensive of trying the other super exotic flavors.  however, upon further inspection i saw a flovor that i couldnt quite wrap my mind around... its 'maize queso', which translates to corn cheese!?!? WHAaAAAaT!?!? i just had to try it... so i asked for a taste n you'll never guess what my new favorite flavor of ice cream is?? thats right!! freakn corn cheese ice cream!! ha! call me crazy (everyone else does) but u def gotta check it out for yourselves, u wont be disappointed, oh and they also have shaved ice n i think yogurt too... plus theyve got traditional flavors too for all u scardey cats.  super cheap prices too... beats cold stone in that dept. for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Well all I can say it offers wide selection of Asian and Filipino products. Nice produce isle very fresh and up to date. I can barely walk through an isle without bumping into someone. Cashier were mute in customer service not really outgoing. You'll find jollibee and chowking and A couple other food outlets."}
{"text":"Never ever coming again. Worst grocery store I'v been too. Stupid crowded especially in the aisles and the wait for meat is ridiculous. I used to go to the Seafood City back at home in National City, CA all the time, but this location I can't deal with."}
{"text":"This is a very nice market to shop at for Asia foods. However you will be waiting in line to check out with 2 people in front of you for 20+ minutes. The reason for a 2-star rating. I have been shopping here for years and nothing has changed with the extremely slow cashiers. All of them are slow. This is ridiculous, Seafood City needs to train their cashiers to move a lot faster. Also the cashiers don't bother to greet you. Management needs to get it together at this location."}
{"text":"Fresh variety of fish and other seafood in a very popular Filipino grocery store. Would recommend if you happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"TLDR: jollibee/chowking/AT&T inside; iffy parking; iffy customer service; self-service seafood; large Filipino selection; hit-or-miss pricing  Seafood City Supermarkets reflect an Americanized version of what a typical Asian supermarket would proffer in terms of selection and environment. This facility provides everything a \"normal\" supermarket would sell, export for the on-site bakery/deli, but then again, who wants honey baked ham when you got tocino and parrot fish right there?   The parking situation is probably better than ChinaTown. It's more spacious, but lacks the cleanliness and even pavement we enjoy (I know...first world problem). The health and sanitation has greatly improved over the years, although the questionable sampling techniques leaves room for improvement.    I'm sure the grandmas and aunties enjoy the ability to select the \"best\" product from the gamut although no one ever utilizes the gloves or hand washing stations. But they do offer a variety of seafood that reminds me of home (i.e. Not the Philippines). Overall, it's a busy store with minimal flies, okay pricing, and inundated checkout lines. I'm sure I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Seafood City, how fitting for an Asian supermarket with emphasis on Filipino cuisine and you guess it \"seafood.\" Just a hop skip away from the second Ranch 99 Market on Maryland Pkwy. We frequent this market quite often with my family and friends. It's a popular Filipino Supermarket chain and its constantly advertise on TFC/The Filipino Channel, with locations in Nor Cal, So Cal, Seattle, Hawaii and most recently in Chicago @ Albany Park.  However, this place is very popular because it's like a default Filipino Town in Las Vegas and contains many eateries and services that many Filipino immigrants and Filipino-Americans have grown accustom to.  Tenants inside: Jollibee- The rival of McDonald's in the Philippines, pretty much if you were to combine McDonald's, KFC, Sabarro with a Filipino twist. FYI: Fried Chicken & Spagetti is considered to be a meal of the middle-upper class in the Philippines.  Red Ribbon- Filipino inspired bakery....(Tiasan or Ube Cake...Oh Yeah!, Ube craze is spreading still)  Chow King- Philippines take on Panda Express/Soup shops with a Filipino twist. The Chinese influence on Filipino cusine.  Grilled City- Filipino style BBQ and Grilled food. (BBQ meats on skewers)  Crispy Town- Fried food specialties (Fish, Pork, Beef and Lumpia/Eggrolls). Delicious vegetable Eggrolls!  Magnolia Ice Cream Shop- Tropical inspired ice cream and halo-halo(mix-mix) shops. Very good!  PNB-Philippine National Bank (money remittance center)  Beauty Salon/Nail Shop  Adjacent/Near Seafood City: Valerio's Tropical Bakeshop-Family owned and operated Filipino bakery.  Tapioca Express-Boba Tea Shop or commonly known in Filipino as, Tsa na may sago!"}
{"text":"Shopping at California Seafood City locations you can make the general statment that Cali is way over taxed compared to any other state!  I love this chain store.  Costumer service is not the best but the prices and selection beat the crapy service on each visit."}
{"text":"My only rant about this place is there should be a designated smoking area/break area for their employees. I dislike walking into the store smelling smoke. Everytime I go in the store, their employees are just standing on the side smoking cigarettes. Uggghhh!!!"}
{"text":"I can't believe it's taken me this long to write a review for Seafood City. Since its inception in May 2007, this has been the home to the Filipino community for all their grocery needs.  As another Yelper mentioned, this is a beehive of Filipinos, which is absolutely true.  Although occasionally I do see 1 or 2 individuals of a different ethnicity, but I'm sure they shop here for the reasonable prices. They offer everything you need to cook a home-made Filipino meal; I usually come here to grab ingredients for my parents. This place is super busy on the weekends, so I don't dare stepping foot here.  That goes along with parking, which is probably even worse.  I tend to park closer to what was previously Barnes & Noble.  There's another review on here stating she was so surprised to see kids playing with live crabs. I was guilty of that too when I was a kid, but honestly what do you expect this is a Filipino super market (Seafood City is probably the best one in town). And she ends her review with \"I'll go to Whole Foods next time I need crab.\" That cracked me up because obviously this place is nothing like Whole Foods , but neither are the prices."}
{"text":"Went for the first time yesterday and wow was it buzzing and I know why let's start with excellent egg roll as big around as my hand full of cabbage and sprouts and meaty deliciousness then for dessert I had halo halo fresh nothing like the jarred stuff I have tried the purple yam ice cream is amazing cannot wait to go back and try other items"}
{"text":"I love this store!  Almost all the products remind me of Philippines.  Every time I'd come here I would stop by jolly-bee and then shop for cheap snacks and drinks!  If your Filipino, love seafood, or like cheap things you should go here.  They sell so many things.  If I could, I would go here every day. :)"}
{"text":"Once I got over just how crowded this place gets I had an absolute blast checking out the seafood selection! Live blue crabs (yes some of the little kids were smacking them on the shells with the tongs, but some of those crabs were fighting back!), a huge selection of fish including parrot fish, live catfish (and frozen), lobster, squid, shrimp, oysters, clams, etc etc. I spent a good 30 minutes just browsing around making little mental notes of the selection for later. I got there around 7 pm on a weekday and it was a tad crazy so I decided I'd come back at opening time the next day before things really got busy.  New opening hours though!! They seem to open at 8 am, not 9!! Wasn't too bad though, had my cart and was wandering around a bit, only occasionally running into the odd elderly grandma or child, lol. I had decided the night before to try my hand at some chioppino and had put together a list of some of the seafood I wanted to get. Ingredients bought were live blue crabs, some alaskan crab legs, clams, cherrystones clams, some squid, fresh shrimp, and some fish. Once you pick what you want and put it into a plastic bag (paper for the crabs) you get in line to have it weighed at the counter. Quick and friendly, and if you have some whole fish you can have it cleaned, gutted, and chopped up for you! Very convenient since I doubt I'd have been too successful at it. I still wish I could have had them do that with the squid, that stuff was nasty to do at home later (yet sooo worth it...yummy).  The fresh ingredients made ALL the difference in the chioppino, my wife was raving about the taste later.  If seafood isn't your thing though they also have a huge selection of pork/chicken/beef to choose from. Pork snout? Beef liver? They have it. Wonderful selection, even the frozen areas were fun to browse through! I saw a huge bag of frozen crawfish that was practically calling my name... mmm, maybe next time."}
{"text":"I love this store fresh fish. the only thing is some of there food is over priced. I buy half my food here and then I go to 168 market for the cheaper items. you can really tell too! but over all clean and affordable. Remember American Items are more expensive. if you get hungry you can eat at Jolibees or the other restaurants."}
{"text":"I totally love this store!! I'm a big fan of seafood and Asian foods. They have a wide variety of everything you would need to make Asian food. I love to make Pancit and lumpia and they always have the ingredients that I need.    Not only is it a great store, they are located just down the street from me which is a big plus for me. I like to be able to just run down the street and get the items I need without going all over town for it.   Downside for me is that this place is so popular that it's ALWAYS so crowded and busy. I always feel rushed to get my items and get out."}
{"text":"I love ethnic grocery stores, it's like you can take a trip to a foreign country without leaving your hometown! Seafood City is a fun place to do just that. I've never bought much here except for some exotic spices and snacks, but the seafood department is something of a marvel. I find myself staring at all the fresh fish for almost an hour ever time I'm in here. Although the parking lot is huge, parking can be a zoo, especially during the weekends. Worth a stop if only for the educational aspect of the place. For foodies, it's a no-brainer!"}
{"text":"Decent place for fish and some asian foods in the valley.    They have a wide variety of fish.  Don't go on the weekends though... It is crowded as hell!  The fish cleaning operation is slow because of the volume of people.  Aisles are really tight, as well as the checkstands.  Its not located in the nicest part of town."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Seafood city.  I love going to explore and find something new to try.  It is also great for all of those things you can't find in your regular store, like manostein.   Yea it is busy, especially on the weekends, but that is part of the fun of it.  Everyone is very friendly and the staff there is very helpful.  If you are looking to try something new or are looking for some specialty stuff, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Since the last time I was here, they have made lots of changes.... 1) They have added more restaurants to dine at. 2) They no longer have the Customer Service Counter, it has been replaced with more merchandise. 3) There is Additional Seating in front of the New Restaurants. 4) I've noticed the Flooring in the Vegetables area has changed. (I guess I'm THAT Observant) 5) They've moved the hand washing station from the Meat Section, to the Seafood Section.  Again this place does get Really Busy almost every day of the week, So Just Plan Accordingly! lol"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in Seafood City Supermarket lately.  Today, price signs all over the floor, floors unkempt, no toilet paper in two out of three stalls, and three cash registers with no less than ten people per stall.  Couldn't fine a manager on the floor.  It used to be immaculate and fun to go too.  Think we'll go to Cárdenas."}
{"text":"Its name caught our eyes, but we were disappointed because it is merely an Asian grocery store, not a seafood \"city\"! Go to 99 or 168 market. You will have more selections."}
{"text":"I'll admit it, I love coming here!!! I get all the essential Filipino things and also get entertained by all my uncles and aunties in the thick flip accent.   Every month or two, I'll take the twenty minute drive to the not so nice part of town and load up on all the Filipino necessities. (Quick tip, don't come here when you are drunk because you will end up spending way more than you originally planned.) On my last adventure, we had to get rice, longanisa (Filipino sweet sausage), soup mixes and chicken. Aside from necessities, we found Red Horse (beer), pastries and lychee.   Be prepared for long check out times depending what time of the day you are here. The employees here aren't that helpful. If you ask where a certain something is, they'll just point with their lips and assume you can find it yourself. They can clean and fry your fish while you finish your shopping. If you work up an appetite after you shop, there is a Jollibee and Chow King conveniently located inside.   P.S. \"Eight pipty por, your order is ray-dee\""}
{"text":"if you are looking for an Asian market this is the place to go, you name it they got it, parking is a little of a challenge, they even have Jollibee, fast food, ready to eat to go Asian favorites, and gives discounts to senior citizens( President elect TRUMP are you reading this?)"}
{"text":"everytime i come here, it feels like home. it has everything i need. grocery, dvd, jolibee and chow king.. :)"}
{"text":"Good location plenty of parking. Often crowded store, so when I was looking to just buy some Hawaiian manapua, I was happy to find and express line of five items or less.  Decent but not great tuna.  I did like the Pompano and would probably go back when they have that on sale again."}
{"text":"I loved this place!  Located off the strip, but it is where many Filipino's go to grab food since it has many restaurants located inside.   Ambiance - 4/5 - Basically a supermarket with many food places inside, seating can be scarce during the rush.  Staff - N/A  Food - 4/5 - From Lechon to Skewers to Chicharronnes, everything was excellent.  What I ordered:  Lechon - Fried Pork.  Lechon is such a delicious item.  It is basically  pork with crunchy fried skin on it.   It is simply amazing.  Pork Skewers - The chicken skewers looked excellent too, but I went with pork and was not disappointed.  Huge chunks of Pork on skewers.  Great.  Chicharronnes - These taste like pork rinds.  If you are a fan of pork rinds, grab them.     Overall, this is a great spot to grab Filipino Food.  If you are able to get off the strip and have a craving, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Nice supermarket for fresh seafood and ulam. Why cook at home when you can just buy from Grill City or from the food court. Friendly staff"}
{"text":"I love going here! It's like my go to place for all the Filipino/Asian foods! It's heck of a lot cleaner than Ranch 99 on Spring Mtn. and I love the service of them cleaning your fish.  I'm also glad they had a number service system, which allows you to pick up your (cleaned fish) or meat and etc.  It's been a lot more organized since it first opened up.  Sometimes I am a little sad that some vegetables aren't there or the sliced salmon filets are usually gone by the middle of the day.  If you want the fresh stuff, get here early in the A.M.  People do tend to buy more in bulks, so you can kiss your fresh stuff goodbye.  Aside from that, I'm glad they're open late.  It's good for my hours, especially when I do get off late.  They're open from 8 to 12 I think? I don't know if they changed the hours.    You can find all Philippines beauty products, a little pricey but I think this is the only big beauty central.  I love how there's a Chow King, Jolibee and Red Ribbon.  It just makes shopping easier!  If you're looking for Filipino vegetables and what not, stop by here.  There stuff is most of the time fresh!  And they 75% of the time have what you're looking for!"}
{"text":"Excellent fried fish! I love the option of picking your own fresh fish (large variety too!) and having it cleaned and fried to your liking on the spot!  The prices are great as well."}
{"text":"I was running low on foodstuffs so thought I would check this place out after my classes. The front area of the place is a food court, with a couple of different dining and bakery establishments. The place actually reminds of Fubonn Shopping Center in Portland, OR, except it is Filipino than Chinese/Vietnamese.  I wasn't terribly impressed with the fresh vegetable and fruit selections. I mean, the prices seemed decent and all but I was expecting more variety. Same with the meat selection. There was a cut of beef that I had been wanting to buy, but they did not have it. I did like the fact that they had all sorts of offal. The fish and seafood selection is probably what they are best known for. I saw many people in the self-service are picking up mollusks and shrimps. There was also a long line for fish cleaning.  Since it is so close to the university, this is a good place for me to stop by after school to pick up common Asian-y foodstuffs."}
{"text":"Filipino market? Lots of fresh seafood variety. Not the highest quality, but very cheap. Very busy. Fun for a first time, but not worth driving all the way from Summerlin."}
{"text":"I love how they have everything you need that's from the Philippines and other asian countries.  They also have 2 restaurants for you to eat.  One is Jollibee and the other is Chow King.  The both are good.  The only reason why I gave 3 stars is because it's really crowded.   I wish they would make this place a little bigger like the Boulevard Mall.   The best time to come here is in the mornings not as crowded."}
{"text":"One stop shop when we come to town! Jollibee, red ribbon, chow king, several deli restaurant & now a magnolia ice cream?! Awesome! Parking is rough but it's convenient. It's busy every time we come, and is not too far of the strip."}
{"text":"This is the perfect place to unleash your inner FOB (Fresh Off the Boat) or if you simply want Filipino grocery items.  RANDOM: It's like a mini Filipino mall with the Chow King and Jollibee (both Filipino fast food chains) stuffed inside the building. There's also \"skin whitening\" products for those who are stuck with a colonial mentality, a cell phone kiosk, and rice cookers. This is also the perfect place to snatch those quintessential \"Yan Yans\", shrimp chips, flip-flops (used for spanking), stew mixes, fish sauce, and brooms - basically ANYTHING Filipino can be found here.  The prices here are a tad steeper than its Southern California locations but I wasn't surprised since moving here. Also, this place is somewhat of a tourist trap for those craving Filipino food/items.  HIGHLIGHTS: - Employees are polite (\"yes sir, ma'am\") - Fresh Fish, Shrimp, Squid, and other seafood (some items can be fried on the spot) - Lots of MSG sold here (which I love)  UH-OH: - It can be super busy at times - Consequently, it's hard to find parking - You might bump into your Tita and she might talk shit"}
{"text":"Very interesting market! And first time visiting.  Something were price cheap and other double the price of walmart and smith's especially if it was an American product.  I tried one of the food court located next to the meat department.  They has chicken skins!! Never knew they existed.  Boy, we're they yummy!! They were very good eating them plain but extremely good with the vinegar they provided with it."}
{"text":"Place is too crowded. All their stackers are always on the way. They need to work during close of business."}
{"text":"stopped in really fast to see if they had Korean Short Ribs.  After going to a few other stores...BAM. They had them here.  Tons of seafood and also restaurants in the front of the store.  I was on my lunch break so didn't have a ton of time to wander around but I will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"Unless you've been sequestered all your life in suburbia, Whole Foods, and other regular supermarkets, you might be a little overwhelmed with this seafood market (like Ms. H down below). But it's one of the best seafood markets in Las Vegas.   It's in the heart of this so-called ghetto neighborhood and it caters to the Filipino and other Asian communities of Vegas. The market offers a variety of fresh produce, noodles, rice, and desserts. As for the seafood, if you're used to the pre-packaged fish fillets (like in Albertson's, Smiths) get used to looking at whole fish with head and tail in all. They offer several types of fish, squid, crab, and lobster. They even have my elusive seaweed salad! You can't get this stuff at Vons.   On another note, it provides a little oasis for the Filipino community. There are Filipino fast food restaurants such as, Jollibee and Chowking. For all those who are homesick. I wouldn't advise eating here though, the food is laden with MSG and grease. And it's so not worth paying that $9.00 for a meal! Also, since it's the only major Filipino market, it gets really crowded. So go in the early mornings to avoid crowds, you can also get first dibs on seafood!"}
{"text":"Be careful when using your cards here. I lost all of my EBT funds because their employee PRESSED and AUTHORIZED the payment while I was about to press NO... she turned the pin pad around to her and pressed YES!!! and they couldn't reverse the transaction... im from out of town and was leaving in 2 days... they wanted me to return to their store after contacting headquarters and EBT... I really have no time for that when this could have easily been prevented had the employee LISTENED and NOT TAKE CONTROL OF MY TRANSACTION... im still looking and researching if there is a case I can file against the store or the employee for this!!!"}
{"text":"Seafood City Supermarket is a nice grocery store that offers a lot of Filipino foods and goods in addition to American groceries. The aisles are fun to browse through, since I can't find a lot of Filipino products back at home. Prices seem pretty reasonable."}
{"text":"Customer service is horrible.  Asked the manager about a price that was incorrect.  As we are trying to talk to her she walks off.  And we come back to it the sign have been changed.  Can't wait for the 99 Ranch to open by them."}
{"text":"It is one of the cleanest seafood city supermarkets i have seen.  I haven't seen seafood city supermarket so lively in awhile. I like the set-up of the place. Jollibee, Red Ribbon and Chowking is very inviting and the open area is welcoming to the public. I also like the background of the parking lot, you can see the silhouette from the strip standing from there."}
{"text":"A Midwestern guy walks into a Filipino Supermarket and gets overwhelmed. Film at 11. Wow, this was one of the more interesting places I've stepped foot into since I moved to Vegas. Parking for this place is a zoo but once you find a space you're in for an experience.   Once inside the door the place reminds me of a Hypermarket with restaurants, a bakery, financial services, and other shops right up front. You walk past all that and into a full fledged supermarket where the first thing you notice is the smell coming from the fish which you can't see at first but you certainly know they're present. This is not your typical American supermarket. It may look like it at first glance, but it's certainly not. So what did I find here?   Produce: They have a good selection but the pricing for some items is a bit higher than I expected. Also the produce section had a LOT of flies. As in even as oblivious as I am to some things when I notice it's pretty bad. But they had some stuff like different varieties of bananas that I haven't seen elsewhere.   A quick loop around the store will take you to the source of the very distinctive smell, the open air fish market. They have a nice sized selection of fish and other things and after you pick out what you want they will clean it up for you. This section of the store is CROWDED. Even a big guy like me got bumped into. And if you don't like raw fish this is not the place for you as people are flying past you with all kinds of it. I overheard grumbling about how long it was taking to process the fish but I just thought it was cool and I want to go back when I can properly transport my fish home in the desert heat.   A walk through the center of the store led me to a lot of different ethnic items, some I've seen at the International Market but quite a few items were unique to this store. The list of unique items is too long to list here, if you're looking for something your best bet is to stop in and look for yourself. I picked up a couple of things (they even had the tamarind hard candy I have trouble finding!) and went to check out. Checkout was packed but moved fast. And the people working the registers were friendly and they actually have a Point of Sale / Credit Card machine that's programmed intelligently. I want to make a point of saying checkout was easy, as it should be elsewhere.   In short I didn't have much time to spend in here but I'm glad I went in and it was quite the experience. I will be back."}
{"text":"got a large selection of filipino foods. Also has decent restaurants in front of the grocery market to choose from such as jollibee, bakeries, and more. decent price. sometimes expensive."}
{"text":"I'm giving it one star because their check out line is way too long.  The longest one in town.  Also because they endorsed Silver Saddle Ranch & Club Galileo project to their own loyal customers.  The above-mentioned company is a complete fraud.  They swindle people into buying a share of a parcel of land and they Jack up the price for something in the desert boonies that is only worth $500 and sell it to unsuspecting buyers for $31,000.  Giving them a 90 min high pressure sales pitch.  Free dinners.  Free hotels.  Free vacation packages.  Free seafood city grocery vouchers.  Free gas cards. Free cruises. Free gifts and so on.  Only none of it is free.  Their tactics are so highly unethical that with their overly inflated prices they can still give away so many freebies that even though not everyone is buying their land they still make huge profits and can still pay the salaries of all their staff involved in this huge scam.  I don't know why they are still in business.  What they are doing is illegal. They should be in jail.  I condemn Seafood City for endorsing Silver Saddle Ranch Galileo project of fraudulent investors.  I can't imagine how much bonus money Seafood City is getting paid for every unlucky referral who is getting seriously ripped of.  Buying garbage.  Not getting any real value for their money.  A complete waste of money.  A complete rip-off.  Some people need to go to jail for this highway robbery.  The buyers never even get a deed or title.  They are sharing the deed with 4000 others units. They will never receive a return on their investment.  It is a complete scam.  A complete fraud.  If you still think the Ranch is legit.  Then I have a bridge to sell you in Brooklyn. Check out rip-off report as well as other posts about the place on yelp and BBB."}
{"text":"They have a pretty crowded food court here now. If you like Filipino food this is for you. We ordered 2 fried tilapias and 2 fried pompanos. My tilapias came out to $12 for both. I would like it fried crispier but it was not bad. It was stuffed with tomatoes, onions, and probably some lemon juice. It had a nice citrusy flavor.  The tilapia had more bones and a bit fishy tasting compared to the pompano. The pompano had a firmer flesh and less of a fish taste even though it was fried less crispy.  I washed it down with a Magnolia ice cream shake. It had a scoop of ice cream, juice and various things like corn nuts, gelatin, etc. It was a nice sweet dessert.  This place is open until midnight for summer hours."}
{"text":"Filipino grocery store open 24 hours.  They have eveything that a supermarket has and more. Most are products from the Philippines but from other Asian countries as well. Aisles are neatly arranged and the store doesn't have that fishy decaying meat smell one encounters at these kind of stores.   Please come to Alexandria along with the Golden Ribbon bakery and Jolie B to put to shame the competition of stores like H-Mart, Grand Mart, etc."}
{"text":"This place is great, found what I wanted.... Lumpia.... Their lumpia was not good quality as they were all stuck together. I had to throw away half of them."}
{"text":"It's been way too long since I've been here and the updates are wonderful! They've added a few restaurants and more choices throughout the store. It is cleaner and more organized then before. Now that I live in Virginia, I'm so upset that I didn't go here more in the past when I lived here because there is only 1 Filipino restaurant in Richmond, no markets! I guess I'll make sure to stock up before I leave!"}
{"text":"I come here when my girl is in need of some ingredients for her Asian cooking. The store is large with many many choices to choose from. It's a one-stop for all your Asian needs. They offer several Filipino restaurants as well, but nothing compares to my girl's Filipino cooking!  They have a very nice size produce area with everything nicely displayed and the items always look so fresh and delicious. They have all the different Asian produce that you can't buy in your regular grocery store. On top of the produce area, they also have a large fresh seafood and meat area where you can buy however much you want or need. This area is always so crowded with all the customers coming for their meats.   They offer a vast selection of rice noodles, rice, frozen items, sauces, chips, desserts as well as household items, beauty items, bakery items and so much more.   My only complaint about this place, if you want to call it a complaint, is the fact that no one here is friendly! I'm used to going into a place and being asked if I need any help, but this place doesn't do this and there are lots of workers here. Maybe it's because they are always busy, but many times we could've used some help but didn't get it."}
{"text":"What other place in Vegas makes me feel like I'm back home like Seafood City does? No other place than this... Place where Tita Baby and Tito Boy shop for their filipino goods.   It may not be the cleanest and most complete supermarket Vegas has but for it being a Filipino Supermarket it sure does the job.  Whitening soap? Check.  Red ribbon ensaymada? Check. Phone cards? Check. Filipino movies? Check. Fresh seafood staring at you in all its fishy smelling glory? Check. You can even have your fish cooked. Yes, we Filipinos are lazy and that's exactly how it is back home.  My ultimate favorite is their marinated meat and OMG their crab!!! It is soooo good. Crab fat and all. *drools*  If you don't look Filipino, don't be surprised at people staring at you.  And even if it's all the way on the other side of town what the heck, for that piece of home? Why not!"}
{"text":"I think my rating for this place definitely has something to do with my heritage.  Let's be honest, it has everything to do with it.  I'm proud to be Filipino and this store really caters to those cultural needs!  The store is huge!  You have electronic booths (cellular services), food court-type options (Jollibee's, a Chinese restaurant and a Filipino bakery) and of course, groceries.  I love how cheap everything is in the produce department. Some of my favorites like bitter melon and other squashes seem to be substantially cheaper than other grocery stores like Smith's or Albertson's.  What I love is the fact that this store also has everything I grew up with.  It's like going through the Asian food aisle at the store...except it's the whole store!  Then, you get to the meat and fish section.  That's where the heart of the store is.  So many types of fish!  So many types of meat.  All kinds of meat parts: pork, chicken and beef.  The back counters are super efficient.  What I love is the fact that you can grab fish, like catfish, take a number and ask the back counter employees to deep fry the fish.  It's a service not many people know about.  I love it!!  If you're in the mood to make pork gisantes, adobo or other Filipino delights, come and check out this place.  I KNOW you'll find what you're looking for :)"}
{"text":"This is very out of the way for me, but since we were in the area, we decided to stop in.   I wanted fish, but it was such a long line for cleaning and such that it probably will be an hour before we get our stuff ready to go home.   Filipino products are obviously abundant and there are some harder to find offerings here. I think if there's some odd thing I need to recreate a Filipino dish this is my go-to. Most dishes though use very common ingredients that I can find in the Asian marts much closer to my area so I don't see myself coming out of the way to come here.   It's a good place for Asian needs on this side of town, but it's nothing special if you're a Filipino living somewhere like the NW like me."}
{"text":"Ah, the one stop shop for all things Filipino. Yes, it's true, a lot of Asian people lounge here to buy their groceries, or pick up their favorite snacks.   My parents usually drop by to pick up some tocino (Filipino breakfast meat) that you can just pop in the pan and cook away.   It's cleaner than Chinatown here and the staff is super helpful. Prices are comparable, a lot of the time it'll be a little more pricer than Chinatown..  Also, you gotta know when to go so that it's not busy = late at night, 2-3 hours before it closes. Filipinos usually be gettin their jollibee and chowking flow on, and you can be free to shop in Seafood City!"}
{"text":"This place is crazy!  it was like black Friday!  OMG, people everywhere!  People, don't move out of your way!  I this was my first visit, but \"I AIN'T GOT TIME FOR THAT\" I'm going to have to figure out a time to go there where it's not all crazy!  But it was cool, I wasn't expecting a food court in there!  it's not only just seafood, its a full grocery store as well.  But they had fish on ice there.  You pick what you want.  My only thing is, I don't know for sure, but I think you have to gut it too ( ewwwwww)  I can't do it or look at it being done.   But when I want something good, I know where to go and pick it up.  I'm glad I have a husband that can do the dirty work for me."}
{"text":"This place is packed, the Deli counter is the worst,seems like everyone is here for fresh fish and meats.Have at least 20minutes or more to pick up something!"}
{"text":"2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge -     26/100  My go-to Filipino grocery market. Located within Vegas' Filipino central... If this is your first time here, as you walk in you'll also see Filipino fast food restaurants such as Chow King, Jollibee, Red Ribbon Bakery, Valerio's Bake Shop, and few new ones as well.   I come here for the affordable produce, fruits and veggies I can't find at my neighborhood market. They also sell fresh fish, meats by the pound, Asian skincare, Asian or Filipino snacks, baked goods from local vendors, a variety of spam flavors, red hot dog, fried fish, and many other Filipino and Asian foods. They have a bigger selection to choose from compared to the smaller Filipino markets in Henderson. Some items are cheaper than the smaller markets around town.   I like it because it's a once stop shop for most of my Filipino food needs. And on my way out, I usually stop at Valerio's Bakery for fresh Pan De Sal and either a drink from Jollibee or Chow King."}

{"text":"Came here to buy beer for the Filipino Potluck!    I figured since it was Filipino town here, they would have decent prices on the beers...damn, $18 for 12 packs!  Red Horse, San Miguel Lager/Negras/Lites...all $18.  Same prices as Total Wine BTW ($9 for 6 packs).  The lines really sucked...I only had a 12 pack of beer, but it took me at least 10-12 minutes standing in line.  Sounds like I am being impatient...probably am lol.  Couldn't believe how busy this place was...reminded me of a cafeteria from high school lol.  But it was pretty clean though considering the walk in traffic."}
{"text":"This placed scared the b-jesus outta me! When you first walk in it's like they have all these strange fast seafood set-ups to your left and right. Non of it looked very appealing. I felt like I was at walmart only with seafood. The floors looked dirty and the lighting was florescent and everything looked sort of green. The live crabs had about 3 pieces of ice underneath and their eyes cut out. I sat and watched in dismay as customers (mostly bored, no intention to buy, teenagers) walked by and hit the live crabs with the tongs. I felt grossed out, sad, and without appetite by the time I turned around and left.  I hope this place closes down, you really do get what you pay for and with seafood I wouldn't risk it anyway. Heading to Whole Foods for my tuna steaks from now on."}
{"text":"Fun grocery store with interesting foods. I can always find something I've never tried before here."}
{"text":"Seafood City provides you with a lot of Asian based food ingredients/ products, majority tending to the Filipino items. Upon entering the store you'll have Jolibee to your right and Chow King to your left if you are ever hungry but if you continue straight you'll see the entire store where produce is to your right and shelf items to your left. I personally only come here to get the Filipino shampoo, Vaseline. Most times Seafood City does not have them in stock for months at a time so when they do get it I buy it in bulk. They have really nice and affordable eating utensils - bowls, plates, spoons, chopsticks, etc."}

But please talk nicely and be respectful to others.., This Guy totally ruin seafood city customer service .,. I was next to this guy while waiting for my friends paying their stuff at the cashier..He was in front of the store to stop all the people who still wants to buy not even knowing the store was about to close ., Yes i understand he just doing his job.,but the way he acts and pushing away the people was totally unrespectful.,. And hey thats my fellow filipino and if you doesnt know whats the word respect means better go to our country and learn how be nice.. Thank you ..Anyways Happy New year.,"}
{"text":"Seafood City Rocks!!!  I wish we have one here in New York.  They have eveything that a supermarket has and more.....mostly are products from the Philippines....from Canned Goods,  Biscuits, Spices to Beauty Products...Shampoos, Cologne and Magazines....but they also have Thai, Malaysian, Chinese & Japanese products as well!!  The seafood section are neatly arranged and clean...Great selection foryour pleasure!!! .You can also have the luxury of having your fish fried, ... you don't have to do it when you go home...something we don't have here in New York...I know they also have the same service in California and Seattle!!!...!!!!   I find the prices very reasonable and affordable...Great place...hope they open one here in New York soon and give Hongkong Supermarket a run for their money!!!!..."}
{"text":"If you shop here it will take you forever to get done especially having your fish cleaned.. on some busy days forget about it, long register line they seem to always have only couple register open, short in staff and short on carts .. definitely its not worth shopping here anymore.."}
{"text":"Smaller and less clean/organize than the ones we visited in Seattle and San Diego. The prepared foods were ok looking but were not tempting enough to buy with the exception of the various seafood balls. No return visit is planned."}
{"text":"This is a Filipino market that also has other Asian stuff. You have to come here on a weekday at an odd time to avoid the crowd of little old Filipino ladies that cut in front of you...I'm pretty tall for an Asian so I'm sure they can see me but old Filipino ladies don't care. Parking can be chaotic. Filipinos are not used to traffic signs/rules so it can get frustrating. Being half-Filipino, I am aware of the lack of discipline which is a trait common among Filipinos...I can't stand it!  Valerio's is a bakery to the left of the entrance of Seafood City. They have good sugar doughnuts that are super heavy and filling...and other Filipino breads and baked goods. They only take cash.  When you walk in, to the left is Chowking. To the right you got Jollibee and Red Ribbon. Straight ahead is a bunch of stalls selling phone cards and a travel agency. Behind all that is a grocery store.  Today, I was looking for ingredients for kare-kare for a potluck - that was my main mission. I couldn't find peanut butter so I asked one of the employees stocking the shelves. \"Excuse me! Excuse me! Where can I find peanut butter?\" But he ignored me or he's completely deaf. Denied! I should've talked in thick PILIPINO aksent and said \"hoy kuya where is da feanat vatter?\" And who would've used his lips to point to where I need to go.   So I ended up leaving with cracker nuts and cakes from Red Ribbon. Mission failed! Since the potluck isn't til next week, I'd have to come back here to buy oxtails and veggies. Sweet Jesus, give me the patience!"}
{"text":"I like the store. Much new and cleaner than other Seafood cities stores in San Diego where I just moved from. Its a bit overcrowded and the meat department was slow. Other than that it was a good experience.Parking lot is big but its still a very packed parking lot.I will be coming here again."}
{"text":"I love this place. Every time I come back home to my second home Las Vegas this is my first pitstop, red Ribbon never did me wrong with mamon  bags of mamon. And chow king makes my other water. Even while I'm typing this out my mouth is watering the thinking about the boneless bangus. And be they have new places that make u feel even more like your in da pilipines. But besides the great quick best Filipino food in the front when you walk in all the groceries all the workers all the candies and snacks and can goods are a true reflection of the Filipino people community food religion! No but seriously if you've had a bad experience here try go back and give it another shot. And if this is your first time visiting seafood city spend some time there is if you're at the fashion show mall you won't regret your experience. They used to have a little clothing store but with the new renovations it's strictly foods! Love it.  Oh and don't forget to get HaloHalo on da way out. Cigey Ka'en NA"}
{"text":"If you love fish and seafood this place is worth a try. I love seafood city! They have fresh fish displayed, with signs that specify the origin and whether it's farm raised or wild caught! Over 50 different kinds of fish to pick from...the best part? Cleaning and frying is free!! Yup you don't have to stink up your house, they do the dirty work for you. The market is huge and also offered fresh produce and many isles to get lost in. Definitely 5 stars."}
{"text":"This is it right here. The Mecca. Lol. Where all the Filipinos flocks for their cooking needs and eats. The grocery store itself isn't all the large, but it offers all you need to throw it down. Produce is great! Meat selection is great! Seafood department...great! Prices...nothing butt-shocking. Pretty reasonable prices and when I'm doing mass lumpia rolling, I come here for the ground pork rather than going to the neighborhood grocery store because it's cheaper.   The only thing that peeves me is when the lines are long...the lines are long. They don't have actual moving conveyer belts to accommodate your grocery so I feel like this system slows them down. Also, it doesnt offer much space either. Y'all ever watched a bunch of Filipinos get impatient? Lol. Before you get your panties in a bunch, I'm Filipino myself. I really wish they upgrade their register areas to prevent overcrowding. Annnd child...let it be a holiday coming up. Whew...  None-the-less, it's my go-to store when I gotta throw down the home eats. I don't recommend bringing a stroller in the actual grocery store because it's somewhat of an inconvenience because certain areas get crowded with customers waiting (ahem seafood area).  BUT! I do recommend Seafood as a market not only for Filipino fare, but for particular meat cuts you just won't find in your typical grocery store.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is always busy! As soon as I stepped through the door, I changed my mind about shopping in there and just turned around to hit up Jolibee... I was craving tocino for breakfast.(lol) At least I got to kill my craving at Jolibee."}
{"text":"This is one of the most extensive seafood markets that I would've never expected to find in the heart of a city.   The selection here is excellent. You walk in, and there are rows of fish on ice, live crabs, crawfish, and lobsters. Pick out what  you want, take it to the counter, so they'll clean it for you, and wait for your number to be called. It's as simple as that and quicker than you would imagine.  I'd definitely go here again. Etiquette tip: do not play with the fish and make them talk to people. It kind of freaks out some of the Asians that are there shopping, but if that's your thing, it's up to you."}
{"text":"Thanks to seafood city.. I dont feel homesick at all. Went there today early morning my husband found a fresh kalamansi.. got so lucky.. Cuz of seafood city i can make any dish that i wanna make.. the problem is usually the items r overpriced. always crowded inside.. the Jollibee omg i wish they have drive thru always full of customers inside lot of people in d line..   about the fish in seafood city.. so bad not fresh at all.. i bought a milkfish (bangus) so i can fry it at home.. im so disappointed cuz the eyes were red but all the organs of the fish are all darked ady feels like i dont wanna eat it..   The Red Ribbon r overpricing too.. i can buy a cake cost 8 dollars for a big size of cake in Smith. but in red ribbon its so small size but it cost over 18 dollars..so worst..  I love eating at the chowling..everything r good..  Wish the employees in the seafood city give more space for the customer cuz whenever i come there they always do the restocking so it make it more crowded inside the store..   if theyre not gonna be good.. 99 ranch will be open soon .. they might lose customers :)"}
{"text":"Awesome supermarket, just because it says seafood city doesn't mean that its all strictly seafood in there. They have fruits, veggies, meat, ingredients, drinks, about 5 restaurants, and a AT&T booth. Lots of parking, lots of Filipinos, and a convenient location."}
{"text":"I guess if you are coming strictly for seafood this could be the place for you, as long as the smell of seafood doesn't bother you as it is quite strong.  We went in here for a few things  after grabbing lunch nearby, other Asian markets on spring mountain have a much better selection and if we're shopping for more than a few things we definatley head that direction other than here.  I highly recommend the UBE muffins, cakes or anything that the bakery out front has, you can't miss it it is bright purple and delicious."}
{"text":"My first time visiting this store and I really liked it. I am a big fan of seafood so I took an adventure across town to check it out. The store is very clean and well staffed. They have a great selection of produce and fresh seafood. The fish selection was very impressive and fairly priced. Live lobsters for $12.99/lb. Live manilla clams for $4.99/lb. Pacific oysters $7.99/ dozen. They even have whelks  for $4.99/lb which I have never seen anywhere in the US. I have a feeling that I will be coming to this store very often in the future. Time to plan a seafood feast!"}
{"text":"I had to bring my mother and the titas (aunties) here while they were visiting so they could have their Filipino food in the time share where they were staying.  I've been here before, but only very quickly to get halo-halo ingredients. On this recent visit, I had a chance to browse the aisles since the ladies like to linger-shop.  I don't eat fish, but if you buy fish here, they will clean it for you in the butcher section.  The beauty section sells whitening soap for the \"dark complected\"--hmm, interesting, but I don't think I'll ever use that.  I had no idea that they sold frozen Filipino dishes a la Lean Cuisine:  pop it in the microwave for a few minutes and bam- sisig is ready!  There was a lot of yelling going on over the intercom: \"Sharlene, please return to your register!\"  Sharlene was called more than once since she must not have heard the yelling the first time, even though the rest of us did.  There was also more than one crying baby.  In fact, the whole visit was very noisy and it felt just like the name suggests:  being on the street in the city.  However, this is one place where we Pinoys can get our native food and you should come to here if you ever need or want some.  Hopefully Sharlene is at her register (name has been changed to protect the innocent who was probably at Jollibee on break having spaghetti with hot dogs)."}
{"text":"Very convenient for Filipino shoppers. Welcome to all. Prices are pretty decent. Some better improvement over time. Friendly employees."}
{"text":"You guys, I have this really humongous love-hate relationship with Seafood City.. & here's why:  LOVE: I love that I can drive to a little \"home away from home\" market that definitely has the feel of being back in the Philippines. You have Chow King and Jollibee PLUS Red Ribbon inside. And the actual market has vegetables/fruits for your Filipino dish. They also sell balut here! But be warned, BALUT is not for the faint of heart! Middle section has condiments, the tabo that you've been needing for your bathroom to wash your pwet, Milo & other Filipino and non-Filipino beverages, and as well as your Filipino chichiria (snacks). Then you have the meats and seafood in the left side of the market which is actually my favorite because it really reminds me of the palengkes in the Philippines. You choose your own fish and put in the bag basically. Prices here are fairly reasonable. It's also pretty clean compared to the other Asian markets in Vegas. And the staff are super nice!  HATE: Oh goodness, what I don't like about this place is how crowded it is in the market. It's small and two people can barely fit in the aisles. I also don't like how my little home away from home is nearly a 30 minute drive from my house. I seriously wish that they would build a Seafood City closer to where I live, and it wouldn't hurt if it was a tad bit bigger than it is now.  Overall: Despite my little rant there, I would have no other choice but to come back here when needed. It's the only Seafood City in Vegas. It's the only place that would remind me of \"home\"."}
{"text":"Unlike other Asian supermarkets here in the Valley, Seafood City is open until midnight. SNAZZY.   While I do frequent SF Market, 168 Market, and Ranch 99 for certain items, Seafood City is by far, and I do mean by far, the cleanest and most well organized of all of the grocery stores.   While I'll save my opinions on the food court for individual reviews (Umm, only Valerio's Bake Shop is worth going to IMO) you can shop and eat which is great if you need to one stop shop.   Best thing about Seafood City is that their produce, while not organic, is crazy cheap and of good quality. I stocked up on their precut bamboo shoots, mint and various types of mushrooms that would cost you a small fortune at Smiths, and we're not even going to discuss what it would cost at Whole Foods (think first born child.)  You can find an abundance of prepackaged items, especially Filipino desert mixes and spices. While others have mentioned that you can find stuff for other Asian cuisines, eh, I'm not sure that I would agree with that. Yam noodles, galangal, Korean red pepper, etc you're definitely not going to find them here - trust me, I've looked and no dice.  As a non-Filipino, but as somebody who has lived with, dated, and worked with Filipinos (not to mention my mom and her whole family living there for a time) I guess I'm used to certain things and can also understand non-Filipinos apprehension about shopping at a store that caters to a certain demographic (See Roger T.'s review.) While most people act neither here nor there about you at this store, nobody is going to straight up not help you if you ask politely. I would be lying though if I said that the cashiers haven't acted like I didn't exist, acted put out by my mere presence and basically have thrown my change into my hand without a word.  In addition to this seemingly passive aggressive behavior, other shoppers have no qualms about jumping you in line. Whatever. Take my money or don't - I don't really care if people are prejudiced against me for whatever reason or not. If I can walk out with my bag of groceries and be charged the same amount as everyone else, that's all I care about. In the end, it's just another grocery store and you should check it out.  Like others have mentioned, parking is chaotic, especially around meal times because of Jason's Deli and Buffalo Wild Wings sharing the main thoroughfare of parking spots. Also, if you need to turn left to get onto Maryland Parkway to go south, you're going to need to exit by Best Buy because it's right turn only foolery out of every exit in this parking lot."}
{"text":"Very nice place this is a place you could buy any seafood you're thinking about. I buy the Lupia wraps there so I can make my own"}
{"text":"My moms favorite place to go when she needs to buy groceries and send money to the philippines. But for me its chaotic. Yet i still love it.   LIKES: the products they have. Most are from the philippines. But the prices are funny. Whenever it comes down to paying, we always hit the $100 mark.  And of course i like jollibee, chowking, and red ribbon. They should add Greenwhich ahaha  DISLIKE: PARKING, SECURITY, LOCATION, and how TINY the market is. Its gets crowded easy, there are rude people who just make their way in and out of the market, people fight over parking, not enough secuity especially when it gets full, and i can barely move my cart around without saying EXCUSE ME or squeezing through aisles. They restock during the busiest hour and i find that annoying. I see boxes everywhere which makes it even more crowded.   Relocate with a bigger store please? Like henderson... :P"}
{"text":"@seafood city/ grill city is the bomb. And the food is reasonably priced. I found a new spot to bring my mother in law when she comes."}
{"text":"Gyoza crazy me, I don't always have the time nor the inclination to go out to eat, so one of the first things I do wherever I live is seek out an Asian supermarket.    Kampai!!!  Seafood City on Maryland Parkway is the jackpot.  Bags of gzyoza to pick from so that at any given moment I have a selection in my freezer.    The product lines concentrate on Filipino foods, but there's enough variety to satisfy most.  Big and airy, high ceilings, well lit and huge, the produce is always fresh and a much better deal than other supermarkets in the area.  Also included are fruits and vegetables beyond the usual broccoli spears and eggplant.  There's also a variety of fast food establishments as you enter their doors, which make good soups and the standard fried chicken baskets.  Just finished off a bag of gyoza...  may have to do a DUMPLING RUN soon..."}
{"text":"I didn't even know this place existed. Inside its a grocery store with a little filipino/chinese restaurant, a Red Ribbon bakery, a Jollibee, and a grocery store. I wandered around a little bit and saw a nice selection of filipino foods. I might have to come back and get some bbq meat sticks, and frozen lumpia. Yummmmmmm.  I didn't look at prices, but the place was clean and lots of people shopping there so it must be a decent place to go.My friend bought lots of things from Red Ribbon bakery to take home to Portland."}
{"text":"I always come here because there's a wide selection of seafood the service here is awesome. And I really love the fact that they can fry your fish here for you."}
{"text":"Seafood City Supermarket is my first choice grocery for specialty Filipino items and obviously for seafood. My only warning is that it's a stinky place. I don't do my bulk shopping here, but it is definitely a place I go to for something specific."}
{"text":"If you ever wonder why the fruits and vegetables are so shiny , they spray it down with stainless steel cleaner( the kind that's smells of Lysol) I was shocked they sprayed it down with chemicals before they put the vegetables down AND after .. they sprayed so much all over"}
{"text":"We found this place by accident (visiting a store in same plaza) and can now say without a doubt that we love this place.  You can find some cheaply priced essentials; Asian delights and very reasonably priced seafood. Oooh the seafood that was why we went back the 2nd time.   We grabbed a few pounds  of whole shrimp and a container of old bay and we couldn't get home fast enough to cook them up and properly season them.  It was heaven; As soon as we can find a place close to the apartment where we can break crabs open and not have to worth about the after effects of smell and the random chunks of flying crab as you break them apart we will be back.    Oh word of advice is to be sure to weigh your seafood before going to the register; it not you hold up the line and look like a fool; we thought it was kinda funny but won't be making that mistake again.  The man at the counter was very nice and was able to use his scale to weigh everything but it took a few minutes.   Be careful/buying dairy/eggs here both of my trips here they had them sitting in the aisles.  I touched a few and they were dry and room temperature. I'm sure the health inspector would have freaked but as long as you are careful on what you buy here you won't leave disappointed."}
{"text":"This market sucks... Maybe I'm biased, since I usually shops at 168 market on Spring Mountain and Jones. Where they have everything you need from Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese, to Filipino and American. Plus their fresh fish and meat department.  I was on the UNLV side and wanted to get some fresh Asian vegetables so I decided to go to Seafood City instead driving over to Chinatown. I've been hearing so much about this Seafood City place.    Their vegetable selection was weak, and most of them are old and dry.  I wanted to get some Thai curry too while I was here but nope, walked down every isle and couldn't find any Thai section. I guess this market only has Filipino food? Their fish did not seem fresh, I was checking the eyes, under the fins and it took me a good old 10 minutes before I found one that fairly decent. And there's a line of people waiting by the seafood department? I don't get it.  Don't waste your time if you are looking for a Asian market that has good and fresh selections, just drive over to Chinatown."}
{"text":"Seafood, yes. Just avoid going to get Seafood on Sundays. It seems to the busiest times. Too long of line to drop your items off to weighed and even longer wait if you want them cleaned.  Vegetables, only if I have to.  The quality of the veggies isn't always so fresh to me. It often looks old and withered. But i can get ube (purple yam) here so that always makes me look past this.  Filipino staple items, yes.   Love the food courts in the front and the bakeries. Easy location with lots of offerings. I can't complain."}
{"text":"Before I moved to Las Vegas, I heard about this place and it became a must do! I was not disappointed! I love looking at the fresh fish and this place is really popular. This place was not here when I was a little girl, I wish it were back then."}
{"text":"This will not be one of my \"adventures in womanizing\". I just came here for a couple of quick items and ended up getting numbers from 3 girls. I didn't even ask. I've never really been attracted to Filipino chicks in the past... but these chicks were like those girls you see on the Filipino soap operas. I thought they were really hot.  I recently had a conversation with 3 non-Asian college students about: \"Which Asian person had the most impact on Asian people today\". They listed off people like: Sun Tzu, Dalai Lama, Mao Zedong, Dr. Feng Shan Ho, Norman Mineta. I being the only person of Asian descent had the most credibility in my opinion. And when it was my turn, I said that the greatest Asian person in history is MANNY PACQUAIO! My argument was that Manny Pacquaio can use his straight left hand to kick the sh!t out of the Dalai Lama, and he can sing better than him as well, therefore he is the greatest Asian person ever.  So, I came to SEAFOOD CITY for some unlicensed Pacquaio merchandise for my Filipino friend who is going to his next fight. Unfortunately, I got off work too late and the Pacquaio store was closed. I decided to just walk around a bit, and I found the selection to be much more superior to Greenland.   We don't really got a good selection of Asian supermarkets here in LV. Every time I ask a Japanese person the question: \"What's the best Japanese Market?\". In a very enthusiastic voice, they always answer by screaming \"GREENNNLLAANND!\" I really can't tell if they are being serious or not.  Also, Notice how I am giving this place a 5-star review while I gave Greenland a 2-star.  SEAFOOD CITY has better customer service than Greenland and many of the items are like a quarter of the price. Not to mention I even got felt up by one chick while I was waiting in line to pay. This place is f*cking awesome."}
{"text":"I wish there was a Filipino grocery market like Seafood city in Denver.  They have everything that I want and miss from the Philippines.  The different variety of foods served here alone makes me miss the Philippines even more.  We came here for lunch and to look for Pacquiao fight shirts.  I had a feeling that they weren't going to have the fight shirts but they would at least have Pacquiao memorabilia.  And they did, and we bought a lot.   After shopping we had lunch at Grill City and almost ordered everything on the menu! We ordered the chicken bbq, squid, lechon, dinuguan, pork bbq, and rice.  We wanted to order more but we knew our eyes were bigger than our stomachs.  All the food was excellent.  Even though we were stuffed, we still had to get some Halo-Halo for the Magnolia place.  Though the Halo2 wasn't as good as we are used to from the Philippines, we were still satisfied to have that available."}
{"text":"Fun place to visit.  Large fish selection...sashimi selection is small. Been there a couple of times and was very, very busy.... too busy to wander and check out items."}
{"text":"Love this place. Has everything you need in all Asian flavors. Prices are great too. Small bakery next door and 3 restaurants on site. Busy place so be prepared for long lines at the cash."}
{"text":"My favorite Asian place to shop groceries after Greenland market. I wish they had more places like this one here in Vegas. They carry some fresh seafood in case you're up to some homecooking planning."}
