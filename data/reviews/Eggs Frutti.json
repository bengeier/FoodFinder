{"text":"Surprisingly nice breakfast joint, nice potatoes. Close to the old Picasso's ( I miss that place). Service, food and coffee were fast and good. I shall be going back."}
{"text":"Excellente nourriture service impeccable samedi gratuit pour les enfants"}
{"text":"I bring my Mom here for breakfast/lunch and I must say it's a big step up over Cora across the street and other breakfast chains. They are very busy at lunch, full of seniors because prices are excellent and portions substantial. Yes, sometimes the service is spotty, when the place is full, but I've had excellent service as well. Meals come out quickly and so it's a good spot for lunch on the run. Been here about ten times and recommend the lunch specials where for the price of a McDonald meal, you can get a full meal. Trying something new, I took Mom to the Decarie \"Eggspectation\" which was noisy, expensive and extremely slow to be served. I'll return here to Eggs Frutti. PS.... The dining room is light and airy, with a high ceiling, making for a nice atmosphere. It's your standard breakfast fare in a nice place, with reasonable prices and service."}
{"text":"Had breakfast with friends yesterday, Aug 24. Breakfast was about $30. Nothing fancy except the presentation. Tip is always optional in Quebec. However, the waitress keeps on coming back and she keep on reminding us to leave her a tip. My friend does not need to be reminded."}
{"text":"This is easily one of the best breakfast places I have ever been to.  The homefries were incredible, the eggs were delicious, and the coffee was much needed and amazing.  I found this place walking around and it is one that I would go back to next time I'm in Montreal.  If you ever get the chance, you need to check out this amazing breakfast joint!"}
{"text":"We went there this morning with friends. First off, Sunday morning is not the time for a quiet and leisurely meal. The place is just very noisy.  The food was just fine, and the servings were quite ample. The service was impeccable, friendly but professional. I was quite impressed by the choices on the menu. Breakfast here means you probably won't need a lunch later on."}
{"text":"Average breakfast place, average breakfast food. The service is excellent - their waitresses are terrific, very friendly and are extremely good at their jobs.    I'd go again just for the friendly, excellent service."}
{"text":"It was unsanitary how the servers would stack meals ontop of other plates with meals on them, and then serve them. There would be four meals stacked ontop of eachother and then served.  I thought it was just one server when I first saw it happening, and then I realised it was multiple servers doing this."}
{"text":"I get to go there often with my girlfriend... It's a nice place for breakfast and prices are reasonable.. The service could be better sometimes but i guess it's the same for any breakfast place when it gets busy.. I certainly recommand this place.. go check it out for yourself......"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfasts, great menu, fair prices and nice decor. I always ask for items not on the menu and 99% of the time its not a problem. Even when busy my coffee keeps getting refilled.  Service is prompt and polite. I don't like that I always have to ask for water, it should be brought right away, but when I ask, they gladly bring it. Be hungry when you go as the portions are not massive, but very generous!"}
{"text":"Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. Although the staff were friendly, I'm not sure how good they are at their jobs. Waitress forgot the water, didn't check in to see if we were enjoying our meals even once. Had she done so herself, I wouldn't have been forced to call over the maître d to point out the issues with my meal. Although I tried to keep eating the eggs Benedict despite the fact that the yolk was cooked through, the 2 medium length hairs I found under the potatoes blew my appetite. Hair on my food I can understand that even passers-by can be the cause. Unfortunately it was evident that this hair entered within the cooking process. 15-20 minutes later I still hadn't received my replacement dish, but the waitress had brought me my check because no one had informed her of my re-fire (industry term for recoiling a dish). Womp Womp."}
{"text":"Fresh & affordable with friendly service..what mire can you ask?  The place looks clean and modern. It's not the exotic type of breakfast/brunch like you will get at Prohibition or Faberge but it's fresh and you can choose from lots of options."}
{"text":"A solid experience, especially if you have children. For every adult, one child eats free, and the childrens breakfasts were impressive. My friend's kid had nutella waffles with a side of fruit and it was a generous portion. Our waitress was fast friendly and very nice to us and the kids. My food was decent and very inexpensive,eggs, bacon, ham, sausages, potatoes fruit and coffee was $11.25! I gave a huge tip to get rid of my Canadian coins ;)  Recommended for people with children."}
{"text":"The decor at Eggs Frutti is so much like that of the inside of a Fruits & Passion store that you might even expect to leave with softer hands. All I'm really referring to actually, are the brilliantly white walls which are adorned with gigantic meteor-like images of fruits. Besides that though, this new brunch joint is pretty typical.  The large fold out menu offers everything you'd expect - eggs, omelets, waffles, pancakes, and shakes. Daily brunch specials such as grilled salmon and salads are handwritten on large sheets of paper and stuck to the wall.  My friend very unfortunately found a hair (the second in two visits! he claims) in his poached egg and wasn't pleased at all. Meanwhile, my fluffy waffles served with a side of creme anglaise and our other brunch table mate's plentiful plate of french toast and all of our various juicy fruit smoothies were just delightful."}
{"text":"Been coming here since they opened, always have eggs and bacon for breakfast or if it's lunchtime I get a BLT.  They also have various pasta plates at lunch. The food and the service is always great, with only exception being when there are multiple large groups of who decide to ask for something as the waitress is walking away."}
{"text":"Breakfast (specifically eggs) I consider a delicate type of food. As in, it's easy to go wrong. This place went wrong so fast. Save yourself the stress and drive up to Orange Cafe or Eggspectation."}
{"text":"The lox platter. It is definitely something out of this world! Demolished it, but it was quite a struggle. It's absolutely beautiful and definitely not what I pictured when ordering it. The fruit was super delicious as well as the lox.  *coming from California, they didn't have jalapeños, avocado or hot sauce.  This place was definitely busy even on a cold rainy day! Prices were great, service was good. The brightness of the fruit platter made the gloomy rainy morning bright and cheery."}
{"text":"My family & I were on the look out for a restaurant we ate at years ago, however, we could not find it. Being starving, we stopped here instead. At first the experience wasn't that great, they seemed understaff for such a busy time and thus we sat for 10 minutes before a waitress came to even give us our menus.  After this, things moved along much better, the food came fast and it was magnificent. The only thing was that the server forgot to give us our drinks and so we had to ask half way through the meal. The waitress was extremely nice though, and I'm sure the service would've been better if they had more servers.  I recommend the Eggs, pancake filled with strawberry, that comes with potates, toast and a choice of sausage, ham or bacon. I devour the ketchup, so I'm glad they had a bottle readily available."}
{"text":"I love this place and crave it all the time. I can't wait to go back to Montreal to enjoy it once again.  It's one of the nicer breakfast/brunch places in Montreal; bright, open and clean. The menu is exhaustive - eggs, pancakes, crepes, etc. There's nothing missing.  I particularly like the lox platter - every in-season fruit is specially cut and adorns the periphery of the plate, where a bed of lettuce is topped with a pile of lox. Bagel of your choice is served alongside with some cream cheese. Perfection.  The prices are good, the portions are what you'd expect...however, the service here is consistently lacking. Don't expect water refills, only coffee. Don't expect to get your bill too quickly either. Food comes out quick but flagging down your server is quite the challenge. I never come when I'm in a rush though and manage to stay perfectly content."}
