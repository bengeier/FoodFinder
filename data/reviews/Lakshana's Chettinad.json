{"text":"Generous portions. Chutney was good, and idlies and dosa were very tasty as well. The pakora were excellent. My kids (age 2 and 4) really enjoyed. Service was friendly and quick. We sadly had to stop going to the other south Indian restaurant in Cotes Des Neiges due to severe food poisoning, so it is great to have Lakshana's Chettinad as an option now. We will be back."}
{"text":"We had the kadai paneer and onion uttapam. It was delicious. We we're craving Indian food and this place definitely hit the spot. The host also was very courteous and gave us recommendations on what to get."}
{"text":"This is currently my favorite Indian restaurant in Montreal -- the food is wonderful and very authentic (the cuisine is specifically that of Chettinad, a place in South India) and the prices are very reasonable. I strongly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service! You'll love the veggie pakora. My personal favourite the paneer tikka masala."}
{"text":"After testing many different Indian restaurants this restaurant is now my favorite in Montreal. The food is simply delicious and tasty. The cheff knows how to play with spices and make a wonderful combination. There are several vegetarian and few vegan options. Appetizers invite you to taste real Indian cuisine. Staff are friendly and always smiling at costumers show proper care."}
{"text":"Really great service and good authentic South indian food. The server was very pleasant and took good care of us. I have never had such good pakoras in Canada. He swiped my card and didn't even add tip or accepted tip!! That just blew my mind! Must go especially for the authenticity and flavors."}
{"text":"If you're considering dining at Lakshana's Chettinad, think no more!  Great food, great service! I ate there almost everyday for two weeks when I first moved into my new apartment.  I really like how they do not have the staple Indian dishes you find in most Indian restaurant.  Again, cannot stress enough how attentive and kind the service is.  Must try's:  - the dal with spinach - the malai kofta (*********) - the uttapam - the onion pakora (?- fried onions) - palak paneer - lamb sag  and these are just the ones i can remember!  The dining area is very basic, but spotless (tables, table cloths, cutlery...).  I would go there again, and again, and again.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"A great restaurant with great service. The place is strictly okay, but food was delicious. I met the chef and he was very passionate about what he does! Strong recommendation for folks in Montreal and looking for great Indian food!"}
{"text":"Awesome South Indian authentic cuisine like home made idly (rice cakes) and dosas ( rice crepes). Must try!"}
{"text":"Best dosa in town! Chutney is perfect."}
{"text":"Well we went there as a last minute resort while driving on that road. The place was empty, with red tacky table cloths and a very distinct odour. I was about to leave but then my family really was hungry. We ended up ordering both north Indian and south Indian food. And both were average... very average. I was disappointed as one my friends really like the place. Service was average too. May be something was wrong that day. I will go again to guve them a second chance."}
{"text":"I had their parotta and chilli paneer from a take away today. Parotta was good but chilli paneer was not good. Heard their pakora was good though."}
{"text":"I ordered the non vegetarian thali & don't have anything good to say about it. The chicken tandoori was dry like every other Indian restaurant out there, the chicken curry sucked and I found it very difficult to get myself to eat anything on the thali. I've tried a lot of Indian restaurants in Montreal and sadly, all of them suck. This one definitely goes on that list too, maybe one of the worst ones in Montreal :( I'm surprised at the good ratings for this place on Yelp"}
