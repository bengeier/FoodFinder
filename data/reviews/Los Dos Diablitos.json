{"text":"I am here for a week for work and I have to eat out alot - this place has awesome service, prices, and food. I don't want to spend $13 a day on breakfast for 5 days straight (I like a hearty first meal) so this is perfect. Breakfast is my fave so far and free coffee with an order."}
{"text":"Went here recently with my family, what an amazing spot! The food was fast, fresh, delicious, and there was plenty of it. Beyond that, the restaurant staff (family owned) were friendly and helpful! The restaurant itself was clean and bright, I will definitely be visiting Los 2 again in the future!"}
{"text":"These guys are neat - go check them out. Thumbs up on steak and chorizo breakfast burritos and salsa.  Waffles at 6PM - it's your goto - and you can even sit outside along University and let everyone know about your waffle issue (there are dozens of us, dozens! - TF).  And, if you're lucky - you might get to meet Uno of the Dos Diablitos in person!"}
{"text":"Just ate a big fat chicken burrito and it was awesome. Good value for money and friendly staff. AND, they have discount for ASU students which I forgot to ask so if you are one, make sure you ask for it."}
{"text":"Los 2 diablitos is a good option for a quickish bite to eat near the much more expensive options on mill. I've been here a few times, and had samples a few of their dishes.   Pros: Everything is pretty cheap. Large burritos are $5 and they have specials that they'll post online and in-store. Burritos are great on the go, they've good sauce options at varying heat levels, and you can even get a short stack of pretty tasty pancakes for around $2, add bacon and eggs for a couple more bucks. Everyone I've interacted with working here is very friendly and courteous. Unless you go during the lunch rush, you'll have this place mostly to yourself. You can play checkers/chess/cards on some of the tables outside.   Cons: Service can be a bit slow. Their kitchen isn't huge, so if you're with a larger party, you'll find yourself waiting a bit. I found their tacos to be a bit bland. They're fine if you add some sauce/lemon, but the meat itself was under-seasoned. Food was served on flimsy paper plates, which was fine for my friend's quesadilla, but not for my huge burrito.   Nice place. It's so close to me, I'll definitely be back. If you're in the area and want a cheap bite to eat, stop by. If not, there are a lot of places like this around town, and tastier non-Mexican options are nearby (that are more expensive)."}
{"text":"Delicious at a great value. I love when places price their items so it's affordable to eat there on the regular. Great family owned spot."}
{"text":"These breakfast burritos are my favorite in Arizona. I moved from Tempe to North Phoenix and still drive to Tempe for these burritos. Plus there is free coffee and nice workers."}
{"text":"I give places 5 stars based on: did I love the food, and would I come back again? Yes and yes for this dope little taco place   I like Los Dos more than Mucha Lucha because of its proximity to my office, and I hate the line at Mucha. Ive had the asada tacos, chicken tacos, and the asada burrito--all very tasty and well portioned. The hot sauce is really good: the red isn't runny like other places, and the extra hot green is creamy and super good on the asada. It's definitely since gotten spicier since my first visit, as I formally would have called it \"white people spicy\". The extra hot green def lives more up to its name this time around.   If you're starving, go for the burritos or if it's Tuesday, get the 99 cent tacos. 5/5 will continue to come here for lunch when I can"}
{"text":"The burritos are good, big, and leave you feeling full. Been here a few times for the morning breakie burritos. However, they use too much cooking oil and the dining area is full of this smoke and it leaves your clothes and hair smelling like a fryer. They leave the door open for this reason, I'm sure, but it brings in flies.   Wouldn't you want a breakie burrito with sausage? They offer bacon and chorizo but not sausage.  The hot sauce is okay, tastes watered down. Nothing special."}
{"text":"Can confirm this is the best breakfast place. I mean, my life is basically ruined as I tried a soy chorizo breakfast burrito and now it's the only thing I want ever. And the sauce! So good. Also, free coffee! (!!) Staff is nice and friendly though with food this good they could chuck it at my head when it was ready and I would still come back."}
{"text":"This place has never disappointed! Tacos are legit. Breakfast burritos are bomb, and huge. Chicken Caesar salad is amazing. I love the diverse menu. They even have waffles! Portions are great, especially for the price. The staff is friendly. I love this spot. They even offer free coffee"}
{"text":"On a conference call and started to get hungry, I remembered seeing this place a couple of weeks ago and decided to give it a try since it was right around the way from work. Ordered a chorizo, egg, potato and cheese burrito with both medium and hot salsa verde. The burrito was huge, chorizo was very nice, not dripping in grease like other burrito places, but the salsa was absolutely spot on. I will be stopping back at this place in the future, very tasty, good portion size, salsa was dynamite.  Thank you."}
{"text":"Good price, delicious food, and friendly employees."}
{"text":"So inexpensive and good and great service!! Bring a student ID for a discount and the coffee is free with purchase! I've come for the breakfast as well as lunch and haven't been disappointed. I recommend croissant breakfast sandwich, the sub, and tacos! Still need to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Delicious!! Family run little gem with super fresh ingredients and warm service.  Great price for large portion. New favorite neighborhood spot!"}
{"text":"A big fan of this place! Everything is inexpensive and delicious & they give a student discount as well. I love their breakfast burritos and the croissant breakfast sandwich!"}
{"text":"We needed a quick breakfast, and this was great. Burrito was made to order, and the bacon was crispy...just how I like it! I asked for extra pico and it tasted great! Staff was really nice and helpful."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a super casual Mexican joint then this is your spot. The food is tasty and the service is friendly. It's not a take your client to eat place but with great food and amazing salsa is doesn't pretend to be."}
{"text":"We couldn't find a breakfast place before we left town and stumbled across this place. Mexican breakfast food was amazing and at a reasonable price. We are from LA and the food quality was great."}
{"text":"We came here on the Yelp recommendations- I was a bit disappointed.  We are from Chicago so our expectation for Mexican food is pretty high.  I had the two taco special with beans and rice for $7.99.  I thought the meat was dry and tough, and overall the taco lacked flavor.  The beans and rice were just that- black beans from a can and white rice.  I was expecting those to have more flavor as well.  My son's burrito had a strange flavor and it was large, but taste was not impressive.  I'm thinking there are better places out there, and the prices weren't that cheap considering the amount of food and bland taste."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Awesome prices and deals, free coffee with your meal, and the breakfast burritos are to die for. Really sweet staff and cozy. I haven't even finished my food and I'm writing this review. Love it!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Fresh ingredients and fast service. Really nice having a good burrito outside of California. In addition the staff was very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Popped in for a breakfast burrito and was not disappointed by the chorizo and egg choice - YUM! service was fast & friendly. Food came out quickly and was delicious! Great price for the portion."}
{"text":"Such great food and service, I've been here twice, once for takeout and once dining in, both times I've been impressed. Low prices as well. I had the veggie torta and the soychorizo breakfast burrito, great!"}
{"text":"Great little hole in the wall. Family business just cranking out solid Mexican food. First time here but will definitely be back. I had the posole (sat/sun only) and it was great. Saw a lot of folks order the breakfast burritos so assuming they must be great too. Not fancy but real good simple dishes."}
{"text":"Quaint spot! I'm visiting from Long Beach,CA. I searched for a Mexican breakfast restaurant in town and this place popped up.  Definitely not what I'm used to but I was hungry and didn't want to drive around an unfamiliar town.  The chorizo burrito was okay, the complimentary coffee helped. Cool spot for the neighborhood it's in."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere & service. Grabbed a free small coffee while my chorizo, potato & egg breakfast burrito was prepared. Went with the mlld sauce. Verde! I'll b back to try the pozole!"}
{"text":"Really good burritos, smoothies and people. Very reasonably priced and great portions! $4.99 breakfast burrito"}
{"text":"Great food! They give free coffee with any purchase too, and it's amazing coffee! The burritos are really well priced and are huge. It's a small local family run place with amazing and cheap food. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I would've given it more stars...BUT the service was just ok. Not that great PLUS they had \"specials\" yet they were not honored. (We got charged more than we should've. The reason the Cashier gave us: \"we haven't changed that.\" The food and portions weren't bad..but I don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Little place with big taste and friendly service. Free coffee, free posole refill, free wi/fi. Noticed I had my laptop and asked me if I needed WiFi password.  People that actually have an awareness of their customers. Had the chorizo breakfast burrito. Really good, but how different can u make a burrito? What makes this one is the homemade salsas. They brought us 3. Mild, hot and xxhot. All three were excellent."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Being from New Mexico, I ALWAYS try burritos from other states. This place has it right, great price for an awesome burrito. Reminded me of home"}
{"text":"This place was delicious and the staff were super friendly. I got the chorizo breakfast burrito (I didn't take a picture because I forgot) but it was delicious and they were pretty big I didn't get to finish because I got full. My friend got the bacon breakfast burrito and my boyfriend got the carne asada burrito and they both were satisfied with their burritos. Would definitely come back. DELICIOUS."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! They make a vegetarian breakfast burrito with Soyrizo that is amazing!!  I've also tried the veggie torta and the veggie burrito which are both delicious. The staff are always so nice. Definitely a must try in Tempe"}
{"text":"After a six hour flight from Honolulu, all I wanted when I got off the plane was a burrito! Where I live there isn't a ton of great Mexican, so this burrito craving had been waiting a long time to be satisfied. Los Dos Diablitos was on the way to our hotel and open late! The two women working in the kitchen were so nice and quickly made our order of carne asada burrito and horchata. The burrito hit the spot perfectly, but I found the horchata to be waaaay too sweet. The shop itself is very clean and if I lived in Phoenix I'd definitely be a regular because of how nice they were."}
{"text":"It was borderline okay. I ordered a breakfast burrito for my first time. It had bacon, potato, egg, and cheese. I wasn't impressed. The tortilla was greasy and didn't feel like an authentic tortilla does. They felt store bought. The Salsa was good, but the bacon was absent of meat, bearing Only fat. The bread and deli items looked fresh, but I don't know if I will return just because of it. Lastly the price...It was $5.00+ some change.  It filled me up, but all in all, I think I'll try somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"I have only ever had the chorizo burrito, but it is delicious I'm afraid to try anything else. A small joint with a decent menu. Parking right in front and usually an open spot. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast burritos! Loved the soyrizo/Egg/potato/cheese & hot salsa!! Nice people."}
{"text":"Friendly service. This place is great. There food is always fresh and cooked in a timely manner."}
{"text":"This place has the best Mexican food, and it's super fast! Every employee here is super happy which makes the atmosphere far less awkward than other places. Get the soy chorizo or veggie burrito! The Tortas are also amazing! Eat well my friends"}
{"text":"Tacos were fresh....love the green salsa.  Fast friendly. Great burros.  Great take out!"}
{"text":"Carne asada burrito was big enough to share. Great flavors! Enjoyed all three levels of hot sauce! Fun find!"}
{"text":"The Burritos are huge!!! Breakfast served all day! And it's a convenient location for me. 2 minute walk!"}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast burritos and tacos. I am glad I gave this place a try because I keep coming back. I come back here because of the quick service, friendly customer service, decent pricing, delicious food, free coffee and their loyalty punch card."}
{"text":"I am so happy when I find little Gems like this.   Great quality, unique options and good prices.   My Soy chorizo burrito was large, on a soft fresh warm tortilla, filled with generous amounts of soy chorizo egg and cheese.  It took about 5 min for the made to order dish to arrive.   The flavors were deep and bold, If that were not enough there is a trinity of hot sauces, Mild green tomitillo, medium red picante and hot green avocado based sauces. Each sauce was well done and made me want to have more to put them on.   I can't wait to try more."}
{"text":"Breakfast burritos on the delicious and  on the cheap. Friendly staff and coffee came free."}
{"text":"This is, absolutely, one of the best places to eat UNIQUE tacos in Phoenix, if you want a \"regular\" and \"conservative\" taco, this isn't your place, the flavors in every plate are different and full of diversity, and the KING OF THE NIGHT is the amazing \"hot hot hot sauce\" can u imagine a celery cream with a lot of spicy flavor? Is a bomb in your mouth.  the service and the family love is in all over the place."}
{"text":"Clean place and good welcome but I didn't like the quality of the meat (asada) they shred the meat too much. Feels like ground beef instead of an authentic (carne asada).   Otherwise the ingredient are fresh and the kitchen is clean."}
{"text":"Great little spot. First time here and had the chorizo breakfast. Definitely above average and not greasy. I'll be back when in Tempe."}
{"text":"awesome breakfast burritos and the green hot sauce is even better. usually the same dude is there every morning and it's always on point! definitely my go to spot for burritos in the hood!!"}
{"text":"So slow. So bad. Not much more can be said. Yelp requires more words before this can be a review so I'll say it again.   So slow. So bad. Not much more can be said."}
{"text":"First time eating at this spot, truly a hidden gem. Ingredients are all fresh. Rice is super yummy and not the typical style you would usually get from a Mexican restaurant. Street tacos they prepare are even better. If you like GOOD quick Mexican food then put this on your list of places to try! I promise you'll be happy you did!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place after driving past it. It's a great location, but the parking is somewhat limited. The lady who took our order was pleasant, but it was a little confusing trying to figure out where to order.  I had the carne asada breakfast burrito and one carne asada taco. Both were bland and underwhelming. I  never salt my food at the table, but had to salt the burrito to get any flavor. The carne asada was dry and the flavor was lacking. Overall, I love supporting local businesses but hopefully they'll improve the food."}
{"text":"I'm from Los Angeles so I'm always on the hunt for some good tacos. This place is a hole in the wall, but don't be deceived by the look because this place is good!! I always used to drive by and one day I found it in yelp and decided to try it out. My only regret was not finding it sooner! The carne asada tacos are my go to."}
{"text":"Tiny little place off university. I had there whole bean and cheese burrito with white rice and guacamole. Nothing basic and simple about the burrito. So much flavor. One of the best I've ever had. 3 different salsas were brought to my table and they were all amazing. I will be coming back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Love this place!! We come to eat here every Saturday. Salsa is delicious and fresh taste very authentic. FREE COFFEE! Everyone that works here always with a positive attitude always making sure that you are satisfied and happy with your food . Love this place so much I always recommend my friends to go here. They have your food out in less than 10 mins I've never had a bad experience here ."}
{"text":"Small spot on University Drive by ASU. Lunchtime was calling and had a burrito on my mine! I was greeted graciously by the server Mariayh and she broke down the menu with some daily specials. I ended up going with the chorizo breakfast burrito. Yes they do serve breakfast all day! My drink was a tasty Jamaica."}
{"text":"Hubby and I tried this place for breakfast burritos.  I got the burrito with bacon and he got chorizo.  The burritos are hefty and bursting with meaty goodness.  The chef knows how to wrap a burrito.  They are very tightly wrapped and there is no way the burrito will fall apart on you.  They offer free coffee when you choose to eat breakfast there.  I would recommend eating your breakfast at the restaurant because they offer 3 delicious salsas that you can use as much of as you want when you eat there.  I loved the green salsa.  They all had nice heat and the heat didn't cancel out the flavor.  The staff was very friendly and seemed genuinely happy that we had chosen Los Dos for our breakfast."}
{"text":"So this place is pretty solid. I have been here several times and they have yet to disappoint.  The breakfasts burritos are good and pretty big.  I had the Crossaint sandwich today and that was pretty good as well.   I would recommend this place over many other breakfast burrito places. I do like that its locally owned.  Since it's small, your order will take longer than fast food. If you are in a hurry, don't expect it to be done quickly."}
{"text":"Great breakfast burritos. I try breakfast burritos all over, and this one was excellent. Seriously, get one. Chorizo was great, not too spicy, great flavor. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"No mystery why the reviews are so high. From the minute we walked in, we were greeted and made to feel very welcome. The smell was amazing and the food didn't disappoint one bit. I had the steak breakfast burrito and my fiancé had the bacon breakfast burrito. We loved them. The salsas were great too.  Free coffee and wifi, what?!  A great spot all around."}
{"text":"Great food great service clean restaurant I would definatly get back here again really like to all there food"}
{"text":"Stopped in with my boyfriend this morning while we were in the area. So glad we did! The parking was on the side of the road but surprisingly we had no issues finding a space right by the door. Guessing most customers are college students who walk/bike? 2 sweet men were working and took our order promptly after answering a few of my questions. I got the chorizo/potato/egg/cheese burro and my bf got the carne asada/egg/cheese burro. We both swore our own order was better lol. My bf piled on all 3 sauces but we both agreed the mild was the best! I love a good green sauce. Highly recommend this little place! It satisfied our breakfast burrito craving and we definately plan on returning to try more of the menu! Super fast service and very affordable. Thanks guys!!!"}
{"text":"I found this place through yelp. Once I saw the menu options and prices I had to try it out. The kids had pancakes, waffles, and smoothies. We had steak tacos, breakfast burritos, and pozole special. Free coffee, wifi, and free refill on pozole. This food reminds me of my moms Sonoran mexican cooking. Bill for a table of 6 was under 40 bucks. The employees are very cordial and the owner came over to ask how everything was. I will be back."}
{"text":"Leaving 4 stars for now as I have not tried everything on the menu. Had the carne asada quesadilla and was very hearty on the meat. They also serve pozole on the weekends. Free wifi!"}
{"text":"Great food, and good people rinning it. The owner is a cool guy. Breakfast burrito is awesome. The carne asada tacos are really good and the had pozole sine of the weekends I've been there and that was amazing too. Recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Really great breakfast burritos! Tried this place for the first time and it's really good. One thing is that it's a bit pricy to add bacon and also don't add a lot for the price. I got the carne asada burrito but it was lacking more meat. I will however will go back!! And their salsas are good"}
{"text":"The bean and cheese burritos are soo good and the hibiscus tea is very good too. It's a nice little restaurant if ur just looking for something nice and quant its a really good place highly recommend the burritos"}
{"text":"This place just opened the other day and everything I have had here has been really tasty and the prices are super reasonable. I've had the potato, egg, and cheese breakfast burrito, the croissant breakfast sandwich (sub avocado for ham), and the shrimp street tacos. The shrimp tacos were especially good. They make their salsa fresh every hour and I am really impressed by the green salsa in particular. Coffee is free every day with the purchase of food."}
{"text":"Service was solid, staff was friendly, free coffee, and a great breakfast burrito at a fair price. Will be back!"}
{"text":"BEST. Mexican food in town.. definitely recommend there carna Asada tacos. They have free coffee which makes it perfect, in the morning to call your order ahead of time. It's always hot and ready, grab my coffee and off to work. The best."}
{"text":"Food is super fresh and the service was great.  They were super courteous.  Free coffee too!"}
{"text":"The best place for breakfast, lunch or dinner! Tastes like authentic Mexican food. Staff is friendly, place is clean and it's very convenient for the neighborhood and businesses near by. Would recommend to anyone. Love this place!"}
{"text":"this place has an amazing soy chorizo breakfast burrito. their customer service is also amazing. love to grab a hot cuppa coffee for free (with purchase). the indoor and outdoor seating are nice, so i like to sit around for a bit reading sometimes when i come here. (hopefully the staff don't mind as the location is quite small.)   today they accidentally added cheese to my burrito, so before letting me know they had already started making me a new correct one, and they asked if we wanted the accident one, too. i'm luckily with someone who eats cheese, so we decided to take it.   the location is good, too, in the hi-tech bruder condos with a small parking lot. i'm happy to say they're never too busy, so i'm hopeful that they're getting more than enough business and are just that fast and good at managing demand.   the only way i can see this place getting better is if they offer some strictly vegan burrito options on the menu. they already have the soy chorizo--they're so close!"}
{"text":"I had a craving for tacos after playing Pokemon Go with my husband at Tempe Beach Park, and using yelp found this place not far from there and with great reviews. We each got a street taco special, one chicken and one carne asada, one with pinto beans one with black.  The food was delicious, but the salsa is what really made it. We got the food to go and it came with two green salsas and two red, and they were both great. My husband and I used every last drop of the four containers they sent with us to go. The red really has a kick to it, and next time I'm going to be sure to ask to try the hot hot hot sauce. The beans and rice were excellent as well. The service was friendly and everything was very reasonably priced.  We'll have to come back and get breakfast sometime and try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Cute little place.  Very friendly staff. I sat outside and was brought my meal plus sauces. Carne asada taco was delicious. I work nearby and plan on bringing coworkers next :D"}
{"text":"So delicious and at such a good price. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a great new breakfast spot. Plenty of parking in the back as well."}
{"text":"Found this little spot using Yelp. Best tacos I've had in awhile! I had the carne Asada and shrimp tacos. Highly recommended! I also drank the Jamaica juice. It's homemade with hibiscus and brown sugar. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Awesome, inexpensive, authentic, family ran Mexican food. I frequent here almost every Sunday for a carne asada breakfast burrito. I highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Small place in a location that has taken down one after another food place, but i think this one will stick. They serve breakfast all day, a good thing in this area near ASU. However, being well past my youthful undergraduate years I decided for a non-breakfast option, the carne asada burrito for $8.99 before tax (my home is that someday America will join every other industrialized nation and go to the VAT tax so the price is what the price is but a topic for another day). I thought that price might be a bit high but the burrito is huge, and it has a solid amount of grilled steak. The provide a small cup of both the green and the red sauce and both are fresh and wonderfully spicy. If you get it to go, ask for extra sauce/salsa. The owner noted that everything is made fresh and I certainly felt that way when I was eating the burrito (well, half of it, so large it is two meals). I will certainly stop by again - a lovely addition to the inexpensive food options in this area.  Oh, for the veggi minded among us they also make their own hummus, a traditional one and a spicier version with cilantro and jalapeno. :-)"}
{"text":"I was riding my bike past this modest place last night and decided to stop in and try something to go.  I'm glad I did.  I ordered the $5.99 special which is 2 carne asada tacos with rice and beans.  What a great deal, with such flavors!  The beans and rice are seasoned nicely, and I enjoyed the tacos doused with their mild green sauce, and sometimes their delicious extra hot green sauce (they have a red hot sauce too).  Next time I want to try a chorizo/potato breakfast burrito, or a torta maybe.  I have a feeling these folks put love into their food (and they were nice too).  Late night hours on the weekends..."}
{"text":"The Posole is phenomenal. You definitely get your $ worth of food. Great little local restaurant."}
{"text":"Good quality breakfast burritos and very friendly staff. Much better than filibertos and others like it in my opinion. The deli fridge at the front filled with miscellaneous bagels in different bags was a little strange though. Maybe try putting some Mexican pastries in there?"}
{"text":"Best breakfast burritos in Tempe. I highly recommend them to anyone !! Great customer service and great tasting food"}
{"text":"Awesome chorizo breakfast burrito! The tortilla is delicious and their sauces to choose from (mild, hot, and extra hot) were perfect."}
{"text":"This place is great! I wanted something close and easy, and they made me the most delicious burrito. VERY GOOD PRICES and a friendly and helpful staff. It's set up cafe style so you can stay or take out. They also do Pozole on weekends! I am going to get some this weekend. Thanks for a great breakfast on a sick day!"}
{"text":"So damn delicious. We got the carne asada burrito (huge) and chicken street tacos (so much meat!). Plus they offer free coffee which was super tasty! Please give them a whirl, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent price. Lots of vegetarian options that aren't on the normal menu. Soy Chorizo burrito is delicious!"}
{"text":"Good for a quick bite when busy. Close to tempe campus...ish.  Clean, small space. Customer service is nice.  I'm just not that into it. I don't crave thier food."}
{"text":"Live down the street from them & was excited to see a Mexican place open up. Ordered street tacos and it did not disappoint! Tastes authentic & Mexican. I love a place with good carne asada tacos!"}
{"text":"This place is bomb. The burritos are solid the break fast burritos are also great. I've got to say the biggest selling point is their extra hot sauce. It's spicy as hell and extremely flavorful so I highly recommend burning your face off if you're into sweating from your eyelids. The price is solid the staff are great. The atmosphere is fine. Go here if you want real Mexican food from a small establishment with great extra hot sauce."}
{"text":"The chorizo here has the perfect amount of spice and not greasy at all like most chorizo I have had elsewhere.  I am avoiding carbs so I ordered the chorizo burrito sans tortilla and potatoes (I added my my own avocado).   With their awesome salsas this was a 5 star breakfast - everything was fresh and it was very inexpensive!    I will be here again and again.   The service was spot on too.    Happy I found this place!"}
{"text":"The people that work here are so friendly and make a great experience. Shrimp tacos were so bomb, we will definitely be going back for more!"}
{"text":"I couldn't say enough good things about this place... when people ask for good breakfast burritos, this is exactly where I refer them to! I've tasted the bacon, chorizo, and the carne asada breakfast burritos and really have no bad review on any of them. Their salsa is good, for flavor I say mild is the way to go, personally I don't like red salsa which is their medium but it taste good with the chips, and their hot is just the right amount of spice. If you want a little more flavor, mix the hot and the mild and it creates a great tasting salsa! If you're contemplating on giving this place a shot, DO IT."}
{"text":"Pizza is  great, do not get a mix drink up stairs tho. I am not one to complain but me and my homie got an AMF and it was the worst mix drink I have ever had. #bewareofupstairs #beardown  Lol oops, I had had a few drinks and wrote this for the wrong restaurant ^^  This was a while ago but I got a carne Asada burrito I believe. It was huge, and very good. If I lived closer to Tempe I would come a lot!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in the neighborhood for a wedding (at The Paseo... Which is BEAUTIFUL btw) in Arizona and stopped by this place with a friend.  We weren't expecting much, but the breakfast burrito with the chimichurri (did i spell this right??) Was bombbbbb!  They give you three sauces (two reds and one green) that vary from mild to spicy and it was honestly so good! The spiciest sauce is definitely not for the faint of heart, but if you're down for a little light sweat, go for it because I did.  The horchata was quite good because it didnt have too much of a cinnamon taste and so was the hibiscus tea !!  This is a small place, but the flavor is big.  If you're nearby, give it a try!"}
{"text":"After biking all evening at Tempe Town Lake, my friend and I were just looking for a hole-in-the-wall to have some good late-night food. We found it at this place, that's for sure! It doesn't have a lot of seating but the workers were very passionate in making sure we found the right food. We appreciate you guys! We thoroughly enjoyed our burritos with the chips and salsa. Great way to finish a long, evening bike ride."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious! Not only is the food fresh and inexpensive, the staff are super friendly. I love that they have vegetarian options. The soyrizo burrito is a must! Even for the carnivores. Wasn't greasy at all and the burrito is HUGE. Definitely recommend stopping by if you're in the area."}
{"text":"DAMN... So needless to say I'm very impressed with the breakfast burrito. Chorizo egg and cheese add bacon. Service was great. I would highly recommend"}
{"text":"The food here is Great And their salsas are always fresh (green is amazing). I had the breakfast burrito with steak egg cheese and potatoes and was not disappointed!"}
{"text":"I was in town to watch a ASU football game and jumped on yelp to find some breakfast , this little Mexican food please was great! Super friendly and food was great! I will be back when I'm in town ."}
{"text":"Good breakfast burritos at a good price!  Never too busy and the food is made fresh when I order.  Always piping hot!"}
{"text":"Ordered a huge amount of breakfast burritos for a work function. The food was delicious and the employees were really kind and helpful. The man working loaded all of the burritos in my car and was just very sweet in general. The burritos were really good. I love chorizo but sometimes it's a greasy mess. NOT HERE! Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Great place to eat with tasty tacos and awesome service! We were from out of town and found the location easily accessible."}
{"text":"Really great potential unfortunately their tacos were dry and the flavor was lackluster. But they have he concept of a great taco down, chopped asada instead of ground, street sized corn tortillas, they do use just too much cabbage."}
{"text":"Complimentary coffee and amazing portions to satisfy your stomach!!!! Great vegan and veggiterian options ! (Soyrizo and potato's burrito)!!! Haven't seen this good of prices in a long time!!! 10/10 recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing (AMAZING!) breakfast burrito with chorizo.  And it is so big, glad I just went with that.  Free coffee this morning and really nice owners!  My go-to place for breakfast and lunch from here on!"}
{"text":"I wish had thought to take a picture but the food was too great to be distracted by my phone. It was DELICIOUS. The portions were great, the prices fitting, the taste though. The taste was authentic. From their Jamaica to their salsas, all was great. Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I stopped by for late breakfast/early lunch and had a potato egg chorizo and cheese burrito (they serve breakfast all day, by the way) and it was one of the best breakfast burritos I have ever eaten. I used to get this same type of burrito from a little mom & pop Mexican grocery near the border as a favorite breakfast when I was a kid, and the one I got here was every bit just as good and brought back so many great memories. They gave me three bottles of salsa to go with, two green and a red, and all three were fabulous.  I will definitely be coming back here for another breakfast burrito fix."}
{"text":"Small shop in an apartment building-- food is ok, but nothing special. I probably wouldn't go there again unless I lived there. Not sure why it's rated so high, besides being so cheap."}
