{"text":"Had a casual lunch here. The savory crepe was delicious, but the cheese became too much after awhile. It's a bit hidden in an office building but it's a great place to take people /coworkers for lunch. It's different from what I usually have (sandwiches, bowls) so every once in awhile I like coming here to change things up. Anything on the savory menu is good. Personally the pesto is great, but definitely try the curry as well! (There's a good kick of spice in it)"}
{"text":"Visited Charliotte and this place is in the lobby where my office was.  Amazing.,.best food I had while visiting.  I need to visit again just to try all the other options.  Staff is very friendly and crepes come out quick and fresh!"}
{"text":"This place is very good. The market its located in is very very cool. I would recommend this place to any one. I just wish their was more ingredients in it. Kind of thin but very good."}
{"text":"I just tried this place for the first time. I had the pleasure of tasting the basil pesto chicken crepe. I died! First of all, I ate the entire thing and it is huge. Secondly, each bite was better than the last, until the very last bite. I am so happy I tried this place and now I am kicking myself because I will be back for breakfast diving headfirst into a nutella filled crepe. I can't wait. :)"}
{"text":"Had the lemon drop crepe - absolutely delicious!  I walked 10 blocks with it so by the time I sat down to eat it, it was cold and it was still amazing!   Freshly squeezed lemon juice, butter and whipped cream - how can you go wrong?  Highly recommend.  Overall prices were reasonable, had lots of good lunch options as well."}
{"text":"Delicious. Got a savory crepe, veggie chipotle. It was very good. I'm excited to go back for a sweet crepe. Wish they had more coffee/espresso options but hardly worth mentioning. The food definitely warrants a another trip."}
{"text":"Crepes are delicious and well worth coming back for. You'll need to find them inside the buildings lobby. The Americana and crime de la crepe were very tasty and filling."}
{"text":"Worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant. I found a very long black hair in my crepe and was refused a refund. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! Very quiet too! We got a breakfast crepe  and a banana/nutella crepe; both were delicious. Great place to start the day."}
{"text":"Hazelnuts has the best crepes! Fair prices, too. The curry chicken has just the right amount of spice and flavor and the crepe batter is top notch - thin, crispy, and delicious. I've been there a few times with the family and have never been disappointed. It is a great option in the 7th street market for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Good crepes, fast service. Its a small place, but friendly and good for a quick breakfast."}
{"text":"I usually go here during lunch during the work week.  I have never seen a line and never have to wait.  I typically get the Maple Dream and it is pretty awesome. The crepe itself is pretty big and you will not need any side items for breakfast or lunch.  I go about once every two weeks.  The guys that work there are extremely nice and will accommodate customizations.  The only reason it is four stars is the price can be a little high when it's all said and done and the making of the crepe can take a little longer than expected."}
{"text":"I found Hazelnuts almost by accident last summer and fell in love with the place. Whether you get one of their breakfast crepes, lunch crepes, or dessert crepes you're in for a real treat. After finding out I was allergic to gluten last fall I was somewhat devastated, no more Hazelnuts. It didn't occur to me until today while I was wandering around the city looking for a place to have breakfast to ask whether they could provide any sort of gluten free alternatives. When I got inside I asked the girl at the register if it would be possible to make one of their crepes into an omelette. I was told that since it wasn't busy they would be happy to! Score! I was warned that they would be making the omelette on the same griddle where they made their crepes. I'm not super sensitive to gluten so it wasn't an issue for me. I got the Turkey Bacon Avocado and, as always, it was delicious and my day was made"}
{"text":"Amazing. Their iced coffee is the best I've ever had and you can't beat their crepes. Love."}
{"text":"Was in Charlotte just long enough to grab a crepe.  So effing tasty and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Worth every penny. Veggy Curry Crepe w/ Egg is awesome. Limited time he has the Samosa crepe. The sweet crepe is also very good... its a regular since I work uptown."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Went here for breakfast on a whim during a trip to Charlotte, and these are by far the best crepes I've had in the US. I had the mariachi crepe, and my wife had a build-your-own. Love it, will return next time I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Hidden on the ground floor of an office building uptown, hazelnuts is a great place to grab an alcohol free brunch. The savory crepes were good, so was the iced coffee. Cashier was sweet. The only negative was that it took a long time to get our food. However, hazelnuts will see us again soon."}
{"text":"I was in Charlotte for a wedding and my friend found this place  (based on yelp reviews) - boy am I glad he did!!  I went with the Maple Dream crepe - eggs, bacon, maple syrup, and powdered sugar, it was EXCELLENT! My friend got a savory crepe (veggies and cheese I think) and he liked his too.   Affordable and delicious, can't go wrong!!"}
{"text":"The Maple Dream is terrific. Iyana style - with bananas and strawberries makes it marvelous. The definition of a great brunch. Staff at this location was great and having fun together."}
{"text":"I stopped by for lunch here. The food was fresh and tasted really good. Although the portion size left me a little bit hungry, I am still giving it a 5 for friendly staff, casual relaxed atmosphere, clean restroom and tasty food."}
{"text":"Great for lunch. Good crepe but price's a little bit high since I need two to really feel full....."}
{"text":"I would like to start off by saying how delicious and unforgettable these crepes at Hazelnuts Creperie are. I for one love crepes and even fix them for breakfast every once in a while. Nevertheless, they had more options than I could believe, even some that I may have questioned. However the few that I sampled from the breakfast, and chicken portion of the menu was perfection. From typically tasting or referring to crepes as sweet, it was nice to give my taste buds a refreshing taste and outlook on crepes.   5 stars all the way!!!"}
{"text":"The crepes were delicious. My friend and I arrived in Charlotte this afternoon and we headed straight to the 7th St. Public Market to find a variety of vendors and shops. The creperie has a great selection of savory, vegetarian, and sweet crepes. The BBQ chicken crepe was absolutely delicious. I am quite satisfied and look forward to coming back again."}
{"text":"This is a really good lunch spot very close to the Marriott hotel/convention center. The staff was very friendly, ingredients in the crepe were fresh, the food made right in front of you and you can either eat there or get it to go. I had the smoked BBQ chicken crepe and it was great. They also serve breakfast crepes all day if you are craving eggs for lunch. Really recommend if you want something other than a sandwich and need something fast."}
{"text":"Thank you for opening up in Blakeney! We went there on Saturday for brunch recently with our son and I had a wonderful experience. We had to wait for 10 minutes for a table to open up but our server was so accomodating. He found a table that was comfortable for our family and was so apologetic for us waiting. The food is delicious and the staff is attentive. We would definitely go back again and I would definitely bring out of town family here for brunch!"}
{"text":"Love these crepes. Seriously my favorite meal right now. I would eat here everyday if I could. I've only tried their Southwestern because it was so amazing the first time, but they all sound delicious."}
{"text":"Deliciousness in one place. I love the environment and all the options they offer. I tried the banana split crepe and this definitely hit the spot. All the flavor a mixed well, and feel like this will be my to go thing from here. My mom had the banana berry cinn and a friend tried the crime de la crepe, everyone seemed to enjoy it.  This place does not compare to any other crepes in the area.  Will be back here more often."}
{"text":"Ordered the banana berry cinn and the maple dream for breakfast. Both were very delicious! Would love to go back and try another for dessert! It is inside a lobby, so as soon as you enter the doors to the lobby, make a right immediately and you'll find your way to there in no time."}
{"text":"I must say AGAIN, Yelper's make it easy to find these LITTLE Gems!  In town for a Panthers vs. Giants game and wanted a light breakfast on Sunday morning before the game.  Hazelnut's was Perfect for a  light breakfast.  I must recommend \"The Maple Dream\" for breakfast!  Go Panthers and a Big Win --- 38 Panthers and 0 Giants!!"}
{"text":"Great crÃªpes, fresh and made to order. Hidden gem for lunch in Uptown Charlotte.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Today was my third time back here and I'll probably go again next week. You'll end up spending $8-9 for the crepe... closer to $12 with chips and a drink. However, the crepe is pretty filling and will hold you over for a while. Not to mention, they're freaking good."}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE this place. We've tried several of the items on the menu (and they're all amazing), but our favorite is the Maple Dream. We went 3 times in 1 week after first trying it."}
{"text":"We ate here on a Sunday morning and let's say I was pleasantly surprised on how good this place was.  First off this is a \"fast food\" breakfast place. It is not a waitress and sit down place. You put your order in, they call your number and you go get it and sit down where you find room. The food is served in paper plates and disposable silverware. However it is delicious and worth trying.  I had the banana & nutella crepe and my husband some spicy egg crepe and we both loved it. The coffee is good and they have other beverages too. The menu is quite extensive and they make the crepes right there in front of you so they don't sit under a heat lamp.   The price is amazing too. If I worked uptown Charlotte I would eat here frequently."}
{"text":"After running the Tobacco Road Half-Marathon, we visited this quaint little establishment for a quick breakfast. We were very pleasantly surprised. The menu features a great selection of both sweet and savory options. We ordered one of each for breakfast, and both were equally delicious. One thing to note for new comers, the creperie is located inside of an indoor market of sorts. There are a couple of different food counters along with a farmer's market and wine store. A very cool environment to pair with the awesome food."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!! I got the maple dream and it was probably the best crepe I have ever had. Pretty reasonable prices, I paid $7.50 for it and it seemed fair."}
{"text":"Just went to Hazelnuts for the first time earlier this afternoon. I walked in to the building, and was surprised that it was a very casual eatery. You simply go up to the counter, order your crepe and take a seat with your number. The place was not too busy so they brought our food out to us at the table. I ordered a make-your-own sweet crepe with strawberries, chocolate chips, and lemon (yes, the combo tasted good!). Very simple yet so tasty. The selection of the savory and the sweet crepes is quite wide and I'm sure anyone can find a combo they would like, whatever mood they are in. I went with two co-workers, one of whom ordered a savory crepe and the other a dessert crepe off the menu, both of which were delicious as well.   The one thing that would make the place better would be if they were open on the weekends or even in the evening hours to serve the date crowd or even the casual crowd. I would enjoy it if I could come in for dessert after dinner uptown or even for lunch with my husband on the weekend. Maybe they are wanting to attract the uptown lunch crowd, but I think expanding the hours would serve it well. Also, perhaps serving beer/wine would complement the crepes. Just a suggestion.   Overall, a great place and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent crepes and selection.  We had the maple breakfast crepe and a banana Nutella.   Tres bon!"}
{"text":"Finally a great crepe place in Charlotte!  I wish I had come here earlier.  I got t he Undo Thai crepe (which was their special of the day).  Really delicious and fresh!  I can't wait to come back again and try their sweet crepes.  Now, I just wish this place was open on weekends for brunch..."}
{"text":"Staying at the Omni Easter weekend for a concert. Looked for something different for breakfast this fits the bill perfectly. Walk across the street it's in the lobby of an office. More of a kiosk feel; paper plates, plastic utensils, but delicious crapes. No booths for proper seating just tables and chairs in the lobby area, still felt fine. Delicious choices, make your own, they don't scrimp on fillings. Quick service even during a rush."}
{"text":"Great food, fast friendly service, and good prices. My boyfriend got the Maple Dream and I got the Banana Berry Cinn. Both were simply amazing. Really filling and reasonably priced! Cool location too, and it didn't take long to get our food even though we were there during peak brunch hours on a Sunday morning. We were just visiting for the weekend but definitely wish we lived in the area so we could go again and again!"}
{"text":"The only downfall to this place is the early closing time but other than that it's a great hidden place to try something new. They really have a crepe for everyone, whether it's on the sweet side or savory side."}
{"text":"The crepes we had for breakfast were to die for! We ordered the hand and Swiss and the the maple dream. Both were gobbled up in minutes. The only reason I didn't give the place a 5 is because of the wait! But that was just indicative of how amazing the food was!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Basil Pesto Chicken crepe and it was delicious! I came back a second time in the same week to order this again.   I noticed that this shop is not nearly as busy as other ones (during weekday lunchtime rush). I'm not sure why. I can only guess that either the wait is a bit long (it takes awhile for them to make the crepes) and/or it is a bit overpriced. I don't mind paying close to $10 for the Basil Pesto Chicken since it is a filling meal, but for the ones with more simple ingredients, I personally think it's too much. For example, a crepe with Banana and Nutella is $6.75. Also, to create your own crepe, the thin crepe itself has a base charge of $4.75!  Again, the savory crepes are quite tasty, so I would probably return every now and then for those."}
{"text":"This eating establishment is located inside an office building. While seating is available, it's atmosphere is cafeteria like. This atmosphere may be a drawback but the crepes are not! I had the smoked BLT crepe which was delectable. The ingredients were combined with their aioli sauce making quite a savory crepe. I look forward to trying other crepes in the future."}
{"text":"Went in this morning and I have to say this will be my new breakfast spot on Sunday mornings. My hazelnut banana crepe was delicious and my coffee was great , and I'm picky about my coffee. Stop by you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Went there for brunch on a Sunday.  Overall really good and tasty.  Our group ordered 5 crepes total.  They made a mistake on one of them.  We requested no onions.  They added onions and held the cheese.  When notified of the mistake they gladly remade it.  I would return again"}
{"text":"Two words: S'MORES. CREPE.  Holy crap that was the best crepe I've ever had. If you have ever wanted to go to Heaven briefly during a meal, then return to Earth, order this crepe. Nutella, caramel, graham cracker, marshmallow.. SO GOOD. Pay the extra $1.50 for a scoop of ice cream on it and it will be the best $1.50 you have ever spent in your life.  The savory crepes were good (Chipotle Chicken), but this place's sweet crepes are on another level.   Big portions and they are generous with the fillings. Crepes were cooked perfectly. Great place for groups and for sharing.  This place's current location in the lobby of a building does not do it justice - It needs its own brick and mortar location ASAP!"}
{"text":"Nice place to grab some crepes as quick lunch or snack. They have some unique savory crepes (e.g samosa crepe) and vegetarian crepes that you don't often find outside. Sweet crepes varieties were limited though. The savory one we tried was really good."}
{"text":"Had the maple dream and it was great. Walked in the rain to find this place. Totally worth it."}
{"text":"Based on the crepes alone, this place deserves 5 stars but I can't give that many based on the service we received.  Before our meals were prepared, their registers went down. For whatever reason, this slowed the chefs down getting all of the crepes made.  We were on our way to catch a flight and were in a rush. Of course, a refund was out of the question since their computers were not working. We waited a whopping 20 minutes. They were so backed up but the chefs literally went into slow motion the entire time and we watched in awe as they continued to several people in line after us get their meals. When we went back to the counter to inquire, they just seemed annoyed instead of being apologetic. When we asked to get ours to go b/c we had been waiting so long, it also seemed like they were annoyed although we tried being as patient as possible."}
{"text":"The GOAT of creperies, the chicken crepe was insane and the smores one was the best dessert I've ever had. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"The minute you walk in the door of the building, you know you are in for a treat!  The smell of Hazelnuts' crepes cooking should be bottled and sold.  I work next door to Hazelnuts and it has become one of my go-to spots for an awesome meal.  I always get a chicken pesto crepe and it is always perfect.  They are very generous with the toppings and the crepe definitely fills you up (and I have a hearty appetite)!  There are small touches that they do that make the crepes stand out, like melting the cheese completely and adding salt/pepper on the finished product.  The owner is always there and is extremely friendly.   I am looking forward to trying one of their sweet crepes in the near future!"}
{"text":"Friday morning. No lines. Gives time to the nice ladies to prepare a nice crepe just right. Deliciosas!"}
{"text":"Our office loves Hazelnuts! It's very quick and always delicious. My favorite is the Maple a Dream because it's sweet and savory- bacon, egg, and cheese crepe with powdered sugar, butter, and syrup on top. Sometimes if we have a group coming for lunch, we will get savory crepes and get a sweet crepe for the table- which is always a big hit."}
{"text":"When a co-worker recommend crepes for lunch I was hesitant... I like leaving a meal satisfied, not hungry and I didn't think a measly crepe would meet this guideline... I was wrong! The crepe is about the size of a large piece of pizza and packed with goodness of your choosing.  My choice was the smoked Blt which was really great, just could of used a something more to really throw it over the edge.  Didn't get a desert crepe so I will have to re visit and re evaluate but because I was pleasantly surprised with this place I give it 4 stars."}
{"text":"Charlotte gem opens up another location, and South Charlotte wins!  The local owners bring a much-needed unique and delicious option to those of us pining for something more than just 'getting by' in over-franchised suburbia.  This is like the Viva Chicken of breakfast/brunch -- it never gets old, the menu is deeeeeep in goodness and the service is great.    They have completely aced the recipe for the crepes that are the backbone of the menu, and have a very well-thought out variety of savory and sweet options that hit a broad cross section of tastes. Crepes aren't quick and they're easily botched, but these folks have their recipe and their process down pat so that the wait times are fine, the quality is high and highly consistent ... it's a reasonable price point that is well worth the hand-crafted treat for your mouth and your tummy (yes, the savory varieties are filling).  I only hope the owners are already looking for more space (or maybe an additional nearby location), because I predict this place is going to get overrun!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the breakfast crepes. It was restaurant quality but far quicker. We will eat here again.  Just a note. It is not a store front. I think it was in the FifthThird building."}
{"text":"Crepes are one of those foods that you either love or hate. The people who hate them have just not been lucky enough to try a good crepe place. If you are in the know and you are on the hunt for the elusive good crepe then your search ends here. Hazelnuts creperie hits the spot. Their Crepes have just the right texture and the selection is straight forward, delicious and seriously addicting. We had the \"South West Veggie\" and for dessert a Nutella Banana crepe topped with maple syrup.    This is a counter service restaurant that is great for when you want something fast and delicious without having to deal with any of the fuss of a full service place so dont expect anything too fancy but the staff was super friendly and the food is really good. After you order you get a pager that will buzz when your food is ready...so the process was really smooth and  efficient.   I know that I will definitely be going back because i no longer have a choice as i am addicted. We have been here 3 times in the last 7 days and already plan on going again tomorrow to try the curry chicken crepe everyone is talking about."}
{"text":"I have been to both this location and the one in 7th street market. The hype is real!  1. Decor is fantastic. Modern and sleek. A fair amount of seating and everywhere was clean. The location is also centrally located which is nice for any place in uptown.  2. The menu options are amazing. Typically on a menu there are a few items that stick out, everything sounds delicious here! The Mariachi, Maple Dream, and Basil Pesto Chicken are all fantastic.   3. They also do breakfast all day which I love. Pricing is pretty standard, although the canned drinks etc are all VERY reasonable ( less than $1)  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Quick, friendly service and delicious food. I just had the smoked BLT and I am already planning what I will have on my next visit"}
{"text":"My son and I just had breakfast here. The crepes were prepared perfectly and the service was great. The chefs were willing to alter ingredients and were very friendly and helpful in helping us choose which crepes to have."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, and an option for those that need something substantial, or something to satisfy your sweet tooth. Atmosphere takes it down to 4 stars, as its in the lobby of an apartment building. Just focus on the yummy food, and you won't know the difference!"}
{"text":"I went with the Creme de la crepe, a Nutella and strawberry filled crepe with whipped cream. The crepe was great! It was a great size and it was prepared perfectly. The service was pretty quick it only took 7 or minutes for my friend and I to receive our orders. The staff was friendly and everyone had a smile on. Great experience overall!"}
{"text":"Great place for crepes.  I was in Charlotte for two days and had breakfast here both mornings.  Unique offerings at a fair price, can't ask for more than that."}
{"text":"Love love love their crepes! The employees are friendly, the restaurant is clean and the crepes are delicious. Minor detail but they have awesome ice cubes, the soft, sonic type. Yum!"}
{"text":"Great Crepes. I tried the chipotle chicken, southwest veggie, and their seasonal special pumpkin one with ice cream. Both the chipotle chicken and southwest veggie were similar with the veggie having beans instead of chicken. The chipotle sauce was good and creamy. Also as a sauce lover, I asked for a side of whatever good sauce they had. They lady was nice enough to let me try all of them. The extra chipotle sauce for both the chicken and veggie crepes was a great extra. The jalapeÃ±o sauce was great also. Slightly spicy, barely noticeable but enough to know it's there. I also tried the curry sauce but was not a big fan. It might taste different with its own special ingredient crepe so will have to try that next time. The pumpkin crepe was amazing. It had enough pumpkin filling without it being too over powering."}
{"text":"This place offers a very clean dinning area, and the food was delicious; the staff members could have done better, and could have been friendlier."}
{"text":"So good we ate here both days we were in town!  Ingredients were very fresh and the crepes were delicious.  Great place for kids as well.  A+"}
{"text":"Great price, great flavor, and very filling. I was so glad to find this little gem. I highly recommend it if you're looking for a healthier spot to eat."}
{"text":"Excellent crepes...sweet, savory, you name it, it's delicious.  We can't go near uptown now without my two teenagers begging to stop in a for a crepe.  Worth the trip for friendly service, great location, outstanding and fresh food!"}
{"text":"Parking was a little challenging. I was the only one there with kids on a weekday for lunch, but there were plenty of highchairs. I ordered the Catalina. Pretty good and filling. The chicken was a bit dry though, and I would've preferred to have the mushrooms cooked a bit. My kids had the Maple Dream. There was only a thin layer of egg in the crepe, but regardless, they enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Delicious food and a bunch of good looking options on the menu. People were really friendly too. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I just found out about this place a few weeks ago. WOW!  Wonderful crepes!  My favorite is the Americana crepe.  Just wonderful.  Great service and a variety of crepe options!  A nice place to connect for business or with friends who work uptown."}
{"text":"1- staff not friendly 2- massive amount of powdered sugar on our ordered...  Local owner take of your business  Also do not wheel trash out of front door, young gentleman worker with glasses wheeling smelly trash out of front in between patrons eating on outside tables!! Seriously?  12:03 PM"}
{"text":"A solid place to grab a good crepe. Usually get this chicken, bacon, ranch and I have never been disappointed. I enjoy them having two locations, one on Tryon and the other at 7th Street Station. They also accept phone orders, so if you're having a busy day, call in your order and it is usually ready by the time you get there and pay for it. Definitely suggest trying this place out for lunch."}
{"text":"I had the Mexican crepe. Wonderful place in the Blakeney area. Friendly staff and fast service."}
{"text":"EXCITED ABOUT EATING BY ERNIE HIERS   This edition of \"Excited about Eating\" has me stepping out of my comfort zone as we visited Hazelnuts CrÃªperie. Now, I wouldn't consider myself a crepe-type guy. I tend to steer toward BBQ and chicken wings, but I am willing to try anything once. If you have never had a crÃªpe, it is a very thin pancake, usually made from wheat or buckwheat flour and is cooked on a crepe griddle. Their consumption is widespread in France.   Hazelnuts CrÃªperie is tucked inside the lobby of a skyscraper in downtown Charlotte. Their menu offers a variety of sweet, savory, and vegetarian options. I chose a breakfast crepe, \"The Mariachi\", which incorporates scrambled eggs, black beans, bacon, tomatoes, mozzarella, red onions, avocados, and Jalapeno cream inside of a perfectly cooked crepe. My wife also chose a breakfast crepe, the \"Chevre & Mozz\", which integrates scrambled eggs, bacon, mushrooms, olives, red onions, and goat and mozzarella cheese.   As for my first crepe ever, \"The Mariachi\" was surprisingly good. I can truly tell you that I was not expecting the depth of flavor that melded together. If fact, I have never really liked avocados, but mixed with the Jalapeno cream, the taste was exceptional with just the right amount of kick. My wife's \"Chevre & Mozz\" also had very deep flavors. For the most part, I do not like mushrooms or olives, but this combination was outstanding, and the goat cheese definitely was the star of the show.  For dessert we shared \"The Chunkster\" which consists of peanut butter, bananas, chocolate chips, trail mix and maple syrup. As a peanut butter lover, this crepe was a little on the sweet side. My wife, not being a peanut butter lover, felt that the peanut butter overwhelmed the crepe and for the most part, it tasted like a warm pb&j minus the jelly. Not one she would try again.  Overall I would highly recommend this restaurant for the crepe connoisseur or for anyone that has never tried a crepe. I would rate this establishment 4 spoons out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving great food.  The restaurant was reviewed by Food Blogger Ernie Hiers in his series \"Excited about Eating\".

{"text":"My boyfriend and I were visiting from out of town for the Panthers game, so we were looking for a quick breakfast/ lunch spot before tailgating around 11am. So glad we found this on Yelp! Contrary to other reviewers I did not find this place hard to find.. they have a very obvious store front.  The menu is extensive -- I truly believe there's something for everyone! Vegetarians, healthy options, meatier options, sweet tooth options and everything in between.   I ordered the Catalina Crepe which had chicken, swiss cheese, mushroom red onion avocado and jalapeno cream. They give you ar estaurant buzzer while you wait so you know when your crepes are ready. From pay to order took probably 5-7 minutes at the most.  My partner ordered the Santorini which was egg, feta cheese, kalamata olives, mushroom spinach and red onions. Both were so delicious, and so filling!   The ingredients work very well together, my avocado was nice and fresh and I loved the jalapeno cream. The swiss cheese with mushrooms also worked so well. I'll be craving these back in Philly, that's for sure! Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness...how delicious!  The staff here is always so friendly and very helpful when trying to decide which of these crepes you should try. I have never had any of the \"savory\" ones, but their dessert ones are TO DIE FOR. Anything with Nutella is always a great thing and boy do they love Nutella! Banana Berry Cinn is my absolute favorite. You really can't go wrong with these crepes. And how great is it that you can have lunch AND dessert in the same place?! A MUST-go for anyone visiting the Queen City."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, first time I had the berry delight crepe and second time I made my own and had the strawberry, chocolate, whip cream crepe.   Although I like goat cheese, I thought this one was a wee bit much for me. I personally don't think the flavors went well with each other. I liked my second one I got but I feel like the crust for the crepe is too thick here.   The crepes here are not bad but definitely not my favorite."}
{"text":"Decided to go here based on exceptional reviews- not really sure what the fuss is about though.. The whole idea of a creperie is for the crepes to be fresh and hot off the stove.  We ordered a banana spit crepe. One would think there is no way you can spoil it- just add bananas, ice cream and Nutella- and you have a happy customer. Well.. the trick is to serve all of that on a freshly-made, hot crepe, not a pre-made cold and crusty on the sides..  Big disappointment."}
{"text":"The crepes were really good. Service was great. Service was fast. It was small so not the greatest place to go when there's a big group. It's nice to have a place that can do a savory and a sweet crepe."}
{"text":"I came here and ate the santorini crepe. It was really good. Definitely would love to try more crepes out from this place, but unfortunately I do not live there to be able to keep on swinging by. My only problem was that I was the only person that was in line, and he took 5 minutes just to ring me up (I had pre-ordered and my food was already waiting for me-- it was kinda cold, even though I ordered it 10 minutes before I got there). Nonetheless, the crepe tasted great and I would definitely be back.. just not sure about coming here when I am on a time crunch, especially if there will be more people waiting in line."}
{"text":"This place makes a solid crepe - ranging from sweet and savory to (relatively) healthy to seriously indulgent (hello maple bacon egg and cheese crepe). But CAREFUL: there are two locations! My sister and I made this mistake and ended up in the corporate cafe inside of a deserted glassy lobby on the weekend (200 S Tryon). It was yummy, but the meal experience itself had no soul.  The OTHER location in the 7th Street Market is what some other reviewers have posted photos of and it's a totally different experience: situated in a bustling food hall with more food gawking and devouring to be had. If you just want a crepe with no fuss, perhaps the first location is for you. Otherwise, check out their other spot. There's so much more fun to be had, and its just a few blocks away. Wish we had only known!"}
{"text":"This is the only spot to get perfect crepes, in my opinion. I love to stop by when in town for business. They have the best flavors and freshest ingredients. Every time I have stopped by this place, the crepe itself was cooked perfectly. Never burnt, never soggy. Don't let the fact that this place is in a lobby of a building fool you or you will surely miss out on this awesomeness:)"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a good crepe place in the states and this one was great! The pesto Capri had the right amount of veggies and then tartness of the goat cheese really made a difference. But the best part was the creme de la crÃ¨me which was a strawberry and Nutella crepe that took me right back to Paris! The crepes were light and fluffy with a touch of crispness on the outside! Absolutely delicious"}
{"text":"Not a fan- doesn't taste fresh and gives me a bad stomach ache. Although, my acquaintances seem to thoroughly enjoy it. Give it a try if you like crepes but I don't recommended."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!!!  I waited for 40 minutes and when I went to get my money back they said my order was next. They apologized advising they were really busy and that they have to take their time to cook everything fully. So I waited again and my crepe was not cooked fully. It was doughy and mushy. I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This place was awesome!! I had just finished the 5k race for the cure and was so hungry!! I had heard this was a great place. Well, I was satisfied!!! My crepes were delicious that I couldn't get enough. You have to try them out."}
{"text":"A good place for brunch!. The crepes are really good. The samosa crepe is really delicious with the good Indian flavour and black beans inside it. It is really close to a South Indian Masala Dosa. I would highly recommend it..!"}
{"text":"I had the Santorini breakfast crepe with olives, spinach and feta. The flavor was good but I couldn't find the egg--maybe they forgot or maybe it was lost in the crepe dough. I would give them another go but ask for extra eggs so it has more protein."}
{"text":"One of our new favorite spots. Everything on the menu is definitely worth trying but our favorites are the Smoked BLT, the Chicken Bacon Ranch and the s'mores crepe. Very good portion size and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Quaint little cafe with good food. I had everyone in the family order something different. I think the family fave was the Not French Toast crepe. Delicious. Will definitely pop back in."}
{"text":"Great little crÃªpe place! It was a small little crÃªpe place that was very nice to have a crÃªpe. Staff was friendly and they had some unusual crÃªpe which I did not think I would like but I did. I had a chicken bacon ranch crÃªpe which was absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Holy Crepe!!  Breakfast at Hazelnuts creperie was simply delightful.  Tucked carefully in an office building lobby, so please be carefully not to overlook this one.  First off,  the place is kept really clean and is environmentally friendly and the servers/cooks were pleasant and greeted me quickly.    As for the food,  the offer a wide selection of breakfast crepes,  but also offer lunch crepes, including a good selection of vegetarian dishes and fresh salads.   For my breakfast I ordered the maple dream, and they were not lying, it was dreamy.   Plenty of bacon and cheddar melted and gently folded in a light crepe that's then topped with maple syrup and a dash of powdered sugar.   Recommend this one for a first timer but I will be branching out next time to the \"Swiss & Delish\"."}
{"text":"Magnifique! I was actually wavering between a few different choices, as they all looked great. I placed my order, and in my typical fashion changed my mind. They were completely amendable to my request. I ended up with the Pesto Capri Crepe, and it was delicious. I will definitely be back to try some other crepes. I'm so glad this place exists to add some variety to the Lunch options uptown."}
{"text":"This wasn't terrible but I guess I'm not a fan of crepes as this was my second time trying them and not being dazzled."}
{"text":"Very nice customer service,  the nutella crepe was the best ! Its a must try if you're in the area"}
{"text":"Yummy! We make the annual trek to Charlotte for Heroes Con and stop at Hazelnuts for crepes one morning each trip. Lovely crepes made in front of you from fresh ingredients. The savory crepes are my fave, my husband goes for the Nutella and Banana, but when the stars collide we share because they are too big to eat alone! Good stuff!"}
{"text":"- I've been looking forward to grabbing breakfast/brunch from this place for awhile now. So finally, Sunday morning my girlfriend & I decided to try it out. Let me just say, if you're not good at finding parking on the side of the road in uptown, be ready to pay for parking. Luckily after driving around the area for about 10mins we got lucky and found free parking on the side of the road.  When we got there we were a little surprise that it was located inside the lobby of a building. but that didn't stop us from eating there. They were pretty busy, but there was a great atmosphere. This is not a restaurant where you will get served. You will have to order and wait for them to call your number. Honestly, if they had an actual restaurant this place would be twice as busy! Now for the best part of my experience! The employees at Hazelnuts Creperie on S. Tryon were absolutely welcoming! I wish we would have gotten the name of the lady at the register. She was so nice and greeted us with a big warm smile even though it had been so busy. We asked her a few questions and she suggested that I get the Chipotle chicken crepe because it was one of her favorites! My girlfriend asked about the Mariachi breakfast crepe and the lady mentioned that it was another favorite. Boy was she right, they were both super delicious! The chipotle chicken crepe is like a salad inside of a crepe. Fresh lettuce and most importantly fresh chicken. The Mariachi, had a little spice to it but nothing too overbearing. It was very cheesy and it has just the right amount of sour cream & guacamole. Overall, all the other girls who were working the time we came worked so well together and really got the crepes out at a decent time."}
{"text":"Food is amazing! Service sucks. My co workers and I put in a order and later found out she called the wrong store to order. Once I got to the store I hadn't realized until they told me they had no orders, oh and I had to pull that out of them. Long story short 4 people tried helping me one lady decides to continue training while 3 others have me repeat my order multiple times and still got it wrong. When we got back we noticed one card was charged twice. The issues continued even as we called. I use to love this place I will not be back to this location ever. The drama that happened all in one day was enough for the housewives. They had the worse attitudes about the situation instead of trying to be helpful. Even one lady came from around the counter to ask what's wrong but with the worse attitude. Sheesh can't get good service many places anymore."}
{"text":"Great crepes! The portions were huge, the price was fair, and the staff was funny! I will definitely come back here! We shared a ham & swiss and the berry delight. The goat cheese was a unique deliciousness & the flavors were great together!"}
{"text":"I have been looking for another crepe place since visiting Tandem Creperie in Travelers Rest, SC.  Hazelnuts was a great find, unless you are looking for it, you might not even see it.  I had the Southwest Veggie, plus chicken and it was fantastic.  I will definitely visit again when in Charlotte -- I wish Charleston had a similar place!"}
{"text":"This place is easy to miss, tucked as it is on the first floor of one of the many office towers in downtown (or, rather, \"uptown\") Charlotte. That would be a shame because this was a nice place to grab a made-to-order but quick, casual, and tasty Sunday breakfast. That said, I don't know that I would necessarily go out of my way for a return visit (for reasons I give below).  Hazelnuts offers breakfast, savory, vegetarian, and sweet crepes, as well as \"do it yourself\" options. My friend had \"The Maple Dream\" (egg, chedder, bacon, maple syrup, butter and powdered sugar with walnuts added). If you think of crepes as being very thin pancakes (a la Talladega Nights), then you can see this is like a great American breakfast all in one neat package.   I prefer savory, so I had the curry chicken crepe, with \"medium\" heat (yellow) curry and the heat was spot on and the flavor very good.  So, four star food. I took a star away from my overall rating for two reasons: (1) everything is served on paper plates with plastic silverware, which I dislike for environmental reasons. (2) They charge $1.00 for a refill of a small coffee. Ouch. These two things left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Very yummy.    Little girl and I had the banana split crepe and it was perfect for the two of us to split.  Nice place to visit if you are shopping in the area and need some food, something different."}
{"text":"Crepes were amazing. Very busy place on a Sunday with limited seating. Really excellent crepes. We had two different types of crepes, then we split a dessert crepe. They are pricey but they all taste great. You order at the counter and pick them up."}
{"text":"Delicious! I got the american and it was hands down best crepe breakfast I've had. If I come back to Charlotte I'll definitely want to hit up this place and 7th street market again!"}
{"text":"Ha, this was surprisingly good.  I ordered the Banana Berry Cinn and after a reasonable wait, it was ready to go.  It is not the prettiest crepe I have had, but it was flavorful and good.  Overall, very good."}
{"text":"So good!  Breakfast crepes made with fresh ingredients.  The best I've ever had-- not chewy, very tender.  You can taste all of the ingredients. I had the ChÃ¨vre and Mozzarella, and my husband had the Pig and Swiss. Yum!  Coffee was good too."}
{"text":"Just had the basil pesto chicken and it was amazing! All the ingredients for very evenly spaced out too, which was a nice change from some other places I have been"}
{"text":"We've been here at least 5 times now. Unfortunately, I can't bring myself to order something other than the very veggie curry crepe...it's that amazing! The spice level is nice, black beans, curry, goat cheese,...everything just tastes so well together.   My son always orders the Maple Dream crepe. It has eggs and bacon, but also maple syrup, so he gets savory and sweet. He loves it. Hazelnuts is his favorite crepe place in Charlotte. Their crepes are always on point. I've never had bad service at this location or the other."}
{"text":"The people were very nice and friendly, the food was excellent, and the service was quick. Really hit the spot!"}
{"text":"I'd like to second the notion that Hazelnuts has some of the best crepes in the QC and I'll even go a step further and say they have the best variety as well. There are few places in town to grab crepes and these guys do a fantastic job.   I had tried to visit a few times in the past but my plans were thwarted by either long lines or impossible parking situations. That should probably be your first plan of attack. Unless you're a briefcase-toting Uptowner or just so happen to find yourself at 200 S Tryon...by happenstance, then you'll have to make the blessed trek of parking. If it's just for a meal, do your damndest to find a meter on 3rd or even out front on Tryon. God speed to you!  The crepes themselves? Hard to say about the thin layer of crepe as the varieties we tried were masked by some awesomely pungent flavors. With that being said, I'm sure you can order a more simplistic crepe if you're in the mood for au originale. For those craving concoctions, the Chipotle Chicken and the Mariachi are rather tasty. Though stuffed to the rafters with foodstuffs, it's a nice breakfast or lunch. I really dig the chipotle chicken, but it did have lettuce playing second fiddle to spinach. Really? Not a fan of that at all. Lettuce does not hold up to heat nearly at all and it made a limp mess inside of my crepe.   The prices are pretty fair for the amount of food you get. I think most would be full after one stuffed crepe. I couldn't finish mine or the one we shared.   Glad to have finally tried Hazelnuts. Great folks over there."}
{"text":"I travel for work, so one of the things that I enjoy doing is trying new foods. That said, I live in Charlotte, and every weekend I stop by and get something here.   The curry chicken and buffalo chicken crepes are my favorites. The workers said that the curry chicken is the most popular, and it's for good reason. Do yourself a favor and get the spicy curry chicken. If you're in more of a breakfast mood, the maple or mariachi crepes would be a great fit.   The only downsides are the seating situation on the weekends. Usually if all of the tables are taken in the market, Tanks Tap(?) usually has spots and they typically don't mind sharing space."}
{"text":"This place is soooo good! Had the curry chicken crepe (you can order mild or spicy, I ordered it mild) and would definitely recommend. This place is in the 7th street market so there's a good amount of options, but you can't go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"This is a nice little breakfast stop. They have a bunch of options. I don't remember the name of my crepe but it had spinach,mushroom, olives, and feta on it. It was yummy!   The only disappointment was I didn't see them make the crepe as in he heated up a crepe that was already made. I'm not sure if this is always the case, I don't think it is I think they are usually made fresh but I believe the crepe maker was on break. I will return to find out!"}
{"text":"Went to uptown location with friends.  Food was delicious! We had the Americana and Maple Dream. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Quick, Fresh, Delicious Visited 2 times. Had the Americana crepe, perfectly done, Savory with spinach and a nice spice level. Second day we had the banana split sweet crepe with a scope of ice cream. Delicious and perfect for those sweet tooth moments. Coffee was okay. Better than the hotel. Choices of San Pellogrino sodas available too"}
{"text":"My new favorite fast food place. Delicious crepes!  Huge selection! Friendly staff. Did I mention the crepes are delicious!  Great price!  Food quality of much more expensive crepe restaurants."}
{"text":"Delicious crepes. I had the chÃ¨vre one and it was awesome. I think one should def ask for the sunny side up egg in theirs instead of scrambled. I didn't give it 5 stars because I need to see if their other crepes are just as good...maybe I got lucky? Looks like I need to go back...poor me."}
{"text":"My second time here and my girlfriend's first. The place is a little hard to find as it's in the lobby area of an office building. It's worth the trip, though. I got the Chunkster and my girlfriend got the Maple Dream. Both were delicious. Some crepe places give you a mostly empty shell with few fillings but not Hazelnuts. These crepes were delicious and packed with fillings and flavor. There's a good variety on the menu, too, with a mix of both savory and sweet crepes."}
{"text":"Innovative concept. Tastes pretty good too!! What kind of meat do they use? I hope it is Boars head."}
{"text":"Tucked away in a lobby of an office building this is worth the trip.  I shared a savory and a sweet crepe with my mom and both were delicious."}
{"text":"I was looking for a new place to grab a quick lunch with a friend in Uptown and decided on Hazelnuts Creperie for something a little more out of the box than the usual sandwich and chips. I'd seen their sign on Tryon Street a few times, which was the only way I knew this hidden spot existed, so I put on my metaphorical beret, hopped aboard my bicycle and pedaled over to Hazlenuts for a Parisian-inspired lunch date.   The place is small, but a good amount of seating is available in the lobby area of the office building where it's located. The menu isn't incredibly extensive, but they do have both savory and sweet options and a \"create your own\" choice that leaves it pretty much up to your imagination with a combination of meats, cheeses, toppings and sauces. My friend and I went the savory route - she created her own chicken and ranch crepe and I ordered the pesto chicken crepe. Both were $7, a good size, pretty tasty and ready in a flash. We would have gladly stuffed our faces with a dessert crepe smothered in Nutella, but alas, willpower won out and we resisted the temptation.   They had a little trouble ringing up my friend's \"create your own\" option at first, but the manager came by to check on us later and offered to sign us up for the free loyalty card, so the effort was definitely appreciated. Overall, Hazelnuts is a great option for a quick and tasty lunch."}
{"text":"MASSIVE crepes, definitely for sharing! They are pretty generous with the filling, too."}
{"text":"Hidden inside the building a bit syou have you walk through the lobby to find the place.  Once you do, be sure to try the pesto chicken and feta crepe.  Excellent! And of course, its name sake, the Hazelnut coffee is a great pairing."}
{"text":"so, ill admit that ive only had one crepe at hazlenuts. Usually, I think that people should refrain from reviewing a restaurant until theyve had multiple dishes (especially if theyre going to give a five star review......like I just did). However, the one crepe that I have had there (multiple times) is heavenly and I think that it alone is worth the glowing review. The strawberry, walnut and goat cheese crepe is the best crepe ive ever had and as a bonus, I dont feel completely unhealthy after eating it. For some reason, I have trouble getting into savory crepes, even when filled with items that I like. To me, a crepe should be sweet but this means that sometimes feel guilty when eating crepes for breakfast because a breakfast item shouldnt be able to double as a dessert (love donuts for example but I never eat them for breakfast). The strawberry goat cheese crepe helps solve my dilemma because it strikes the perfect balance between savory and sweet. Im certainly not claiming that its health food but its nice to know that thanks to the walnuts and goat cheese, Im getting some protein along with my sugar.  Its pretty unusual for me to go to a restaurant and get the same dish every time since I crave variety when it comes to food but when I walk into Hazelnut, I cant bear to order anything other than my beloved strawberry crepe. Ive heard great things about all of their crepes so one day, maybe I will branch out but I cant make any promises!"}
{"text":"Confession: I ate a dessert crepe for breakfast and it was magical. It comes out warm and crispy, with the perfect amount of fruit to (sinful) filling ratio. At least it had a banana in it so I could pretend it was a relatively balanced breakfast. The coffee was cheap, too, at under $2. Service was kind and efficient, and although they don't walk it out to your table, you are greeted with a smile when you pick it up. What more could you ask for?! :)  Pro-Tip: located inside 7th street public market!"}
{"text":"Wanting something different for breakfast, I decided to try this place on my walk in to work.  It's a pretty small open space serving breakfast, lunch and dessert crepes.  I had a breakfast crepe with egg whites, spinach, mushrooms, tomatoes, swiss and red pepper tapenade............it actually sounds better than it tasted.  It looked and smell great but it just didn't register on the taste scale for me...perhaps the dessert crepes are better but the breakfast was just okay for me."}
{"text":"Wow!!!! Such a great find! They've been there about 2 months and I believe they will be there for years to come.  My friend and I stopped in one Friday night looking to satisfy a evening snack and sweet tooth.  We opted for the chicken pesto crepe (minus goat cheese) and the cream de le crepe (strawberries, Nutella, whipped cream).  Both were AMAZING!! We thought we would be able to share and ended up going back to order seconds of the chicken pesto! The staff were extra friendly and the price is reasonable (~$7.50-$8.50) for the amount and quality of food received. If you're ever in the area, I highly recommend stopping in to give them a try!"}
{"text":"Went here for a quick breakfast this morning. It was a little hard to find being that it's in a lobby but there was a sign out front and a lady who was sitting in  chair helped me out. Got the smores Ala mode, because yolo. It was good! Better than other smores crepes that I've had. In and out nice and quick, and it was really good and is worth checking out."}
{"text":"I was unaware of where this place was exactly even walking past the building quite a few times.  I'm glad I followed the other yelpers to try it!  I had the Maple Dream: Scrambled Egg, Cheddar, Bacon, Maple Syrup, Butter & Powdered Sugar.  It was a little bit of a wait, but they made it fresh right there and it was delicious!   I wish I had room in my stomach to try one of the sweet crepes, but unfortunately, the first crepe was quite filling.  I'm going to have to go back to try one!"}
{"text":"YUMMM! I want all the crepes! The Maple Dream, Ham & Swiss, Chicken Bacon Ranch, Banana Berry Cinn, Creme De La Crepe are all delicious. Don't pass this place up."}
{"text":"I have no tolerance for any place that puts rotten food in people's to-go orders.  It's not like I'm going to sit there and rip apart my crepe while standing up at the takeout counter to make sure everything is not rancid - that's the restaurant's duty.    I had one experience that was OK - then today I went back and ordered the Catalina, only to return to my office 20 minutes later to find rotten, disgusting avocado throughout the dish.  I'm not talking slightly browned due to oxidation - I mean black.  More black than green.  I would say the avocados were 80% black or brown with a slight tint of brownish green.  I've uploaded photos, check them out if you doubt me.  The problem is, I don't have time to walk back down there and get something else to eat, so I sit through my entire day with no food thanks to this place.    The icing on the cake:  when I called to ask for a refund, I was given attitude by the manager.  Ultimately he apologized, telling me he thought I was a \"cold call.\"  Nope.  Just a hungry ex-customer who was served rotten food.  The only reason this gets 2 stars is because my prior experience was mediocre (3-star), so I split the difference.  I would NOT recommend this place based on poor quality control (what else are they serving people that is rotten?  I highly doubt this was the first time something like this has happened) and poor customer service.  Those are the two things a restaurant must stand behind - it's food and its employees.  This place has neither.  Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"The guy working suggested I try \"The Mariachi\" breakfast crepe as it was my first time at Hazelnuts Creperie. I fell in love with the spicy goodness he created for me! As a lover of spicy food, this option had the perfect amount of spice for a breakfast option. The avocado was the selling point, but the jalapeÃ±o creme made it delicious! I will definitely be back!  Ps, they validate parking in the garage for up to 90 minutes :)"}
{"text":"Yes... Can I get a side of crepe with my spinach. I got the pesto Capri crepe. Flavor was awesome after I took out majority of the fresh spinach. My one critique would be to sautÃ© the spinach. Maybe it's just me.   Service was spot on and everyone was so chipper. Service was fast. And I like that they have a variety of vegetarian options. I also like that they substitute because I had a couple ingredients taken out, and they offered an alternative so I can have a filling meal.   I'll definitely go back, maybe just not for one with spinach in it or I'll just see if they can sautÃ© the spinach."}
{"text":"In Charlotte for business and this place is incredibly delicious. A lot of options to choose from. Reasonable price. Food comes out fairy quick but is great quality. Great staff as well. Went here twice in the 3 days I was here."}
{"text":"Amazing food! I had their Americana was delish and very healthy and fresh. Staff are super friendly and fast serving! Love it"}
{"text":"The people that work there are super friendly and I love the crepes! I always get the s'mores! It's a really fun place and a fun twist on traditional crepes!"}
{"text":"Crepe was good, but not worth the 35 minute wait. I've definitely had better crepes stateside. There was not enough seating to handle the amount of patrons in line, so most of us had to stand. I wouldn't recommend going here on a Sunday after a big sporting  event is in town, unless you don't mind waiting."}
{"text":"Great variety savory and sweet. Friendly service and high quality good food at decent price"}
{"text":"We picked this place because of the ratings, we were surprised to find that it was in a lobby of a building. However we were very pleasantly surprised with just how tasty these crepes were! We ordered the mariachi, the Americano and a Nutella banana crepe. The savory crepes were incredible! And the sweet one met expectations. I would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"This is one popular spot (they also have a location in the 7th Street Market). I arrived on a Sunday afternoon and they said it is always busy. It's not really a restaurant, but designed for ordering at the counter and ideally taking it to go. If you are lucky, you'll find a spot at a table lining the hallway and lobby area. On a busy day, plan a good 15-25 minute wait from standing in line to getting your crepe.  They have a good variety to please anyone: sweet or savory. I ordered a vegetarian crepe and it was just the right amount, flavor and size, for a quick lunch stop before heading over to the Belk Theater to catch a show."}
{"text":"I like this location much better than their other one. You can park in the 7th Street Parking Garage and get your parking validated. Makes curbing your craving a breeze.   I love the 7th Street Market anyway, so while taking some guests around Charlotte, we thought this would be ideal so everyone could get what they want. When I walked past Hazelnuts, I glanced at their menu...the s'mores a la mode stopped me right in my tracks. I'll take one please!  Pretty quick made-to-order. I walked back to the table, plate in hand, and a grin from ear to ear. The marshmallows made for an ooey-gooey delicious bite. The nutella and ice cream with a drizzle of caramel was made this a true dessert."}
{"text":"Love this addition to south Charlotte! You can choose from breakfast, savory or sweet crepes and there are vegetarian options too.  We ordered the chipotle chicken crepe and the creme de la crepe (strawberries and nutella).  Both were delicious but my favorite was definitely the sweet crepe. We added a scoop of vanilla ice cream - yum!"}
{"text":"I generally get the BBQ chicken crepe.  Love it.  I haven't had a dessert crepe but the flavors are the star here for savory crepes. There is a medium seating area in the lobby area that I've seen pretty full at about 1230PM but there has never been a time wheren I have not been able to find a place to enjoy my very yummy BBQ chicken delight."}
{"text":"I'm impress with how crispy the crepe is. Drinking hot tea and crepe is one of the best combo when it's cold and raining. Went there two weeks ago and will try other kind of crepes next time"}
{"text":"This tiny creperie is a delicious new addition to Charlotte, and within walking distance to Bank of America Stadium! It's like a subway of crepes, except mind-blowingly delicious! I highly recommend the day's special, the Chiliman's crepe, which was a savory concoction of chicken, sausage, green peppers, and a calico creole aioli. It was absolutely amazing! I'd love to go back and try one of their sweet crepes, since they were a big hit with the rest of our party! Their coffee is locally roasted and tastes like heaven. My only gripe (and I'm really reaching with this) is a lack of seating, but in such a small little place you can't expect too much! I highly recommend this as a must-stop on anyone's day!"}
{"text":"Cute little lobby resturaunt. The lady working was friendly, upbeat, and extremely helpful. Plus the food was thebomb.com. I wish there was one in Winston."}
{"text":"Perfect place to sit and relax with a good atmosphere , service is quick and there are definite good amount of options for crepes , the Americana breakfast crape is delicious and filling , perfect any time of day, the creme de la crepe is a flavorful sweet crape perfect for a dessert option , in originally for ny and have tried many places , hazelnuts must have been the best I've tried"}
{"text":"Recently discovered Hazlenuts Creperie as it's only a block from my office in Uptown. Kind of tough to find, at first. But as soon as you enter the building, you are immediately struck by the buttery scent of crepes! What makes this unusual, at least for THIS area, is that they specialize in SAVORY crepes. The first crepe I had here, for lunch, was their lunch special chicken curry (sweeter version of curry, not madras or hot style), with mango chutney added. Combined with that delicious crepe batter, it was HEAVENLY! Because the shop was so new, the owner, a nice fellow named \"Asi,\" offered us a free dessert crepe, complete with goat cheese, walnuts, fresh strawberries and drizzled with honey. Oh was that ever good!  Just today, went back to try their breakfast crepes. I'm SO glad I did, as I customized it by adding a scrambled egg, brie cheese, ham and bacon. Anything with Brie just is killer, so this crepe was killer! So flavorful, and a very nice sized one too.  Price wise, they are very reasonable, and certainly worth every penny! This is SO what Charlotte needed. Go check it out, and tell Asi that Paul sent you! (I promised I'd spread the word)."}
{"text":"Was here last night at the 7th Street Public Market. Why would you not stop for a Crepe? We were at a Crepe frenzy.  The Basil Pesto Chicken Crepe- Fresh and oozing with cheese. Eat it while it's hot for it does not taste the same when it's cooled down. Portion enough to share with a friend or family member.  Talk about the Curry Chicken Crepe- Even though we ordered mild it was a tad spicy thank goodness with the sweet blend of Mango Chutney it was \"Spicy-Tangy\" and right up my alley.    Definitely, died and gone to heaven with the Create your own Crepe. Add your own desired toppings. This is what we added- Nutella, Banana, Graham Cracker, Whipped Cream with a scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream, who can ask for anything more.  Staff was friendly and helpful with selecting crepes- there were tons to choose from. They provided you with a vibrating pager to let you know when your crepe is ready. How cool is that! Can continue to shop and walk around the market without any distractions."}
{"text":"I went to Hazelnuts after getting some pizza from Pure pizza! It was a great way to wrap up date night at 7th street market. We had the Banana Split crepe, sans the strawberry syrup, and it was absolutely to die for! If you like a pairing of banana, Nutella, and ice cream (and who doesn't!), I would absolutely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Gets very busy during lunch time so be prepared to have a little time, but the food is delicious and worth the wait!! I was worried it wouldn't be enough food but the savory crepes are very filling and delicious!  This is tucked back in a building so is a little hard to find and there isn't a ton of seating."}
{"text":"I had a buffalo chicken crepe.  The crepe was crispy on the outside and packed with fillings- chicken lettuce blue cheese hot sauce. Very tasty.  I was starving so i wanted something with protein, I will try a sweet one next time.  Lots of Nutella choices.  Very clean and had nice kids working there"}
{"text":"So glad we found this little gem on our trip to Charlotte. It's tucked away in the lobby of the building but we were greeted by such friendly smiling staff and it genuinely brightened my morning. They were also patient with my band of misfits.  But you're reading this review to know how the food tastes. It was superb! I would go back every day if I could. I enjoyed the crepe with eggs and bacon with syrup. Delicious! Many options to choose from including breakfast, savory, and sweet. Definitely something for everyone.   There is not a lot of seating but you can grab your meal to go and eat at the lovely plaza with fountains just down the street."}
{"text":"Best crepes ever. Great for vegetarians with an entire section of options. We tried the crepe samosa and it was delicious and ordered other regular breakfast crepes and everything was good. Would recommend this place. A very small detail that I didn't like was thier cheap disposable plates which could be easily replaced with something better."}
{"text":"This is a great little crÃªpe place in the 7th  Street market.  I got a veggie curry crÃªpe with goat cheese and it was phenomenal. The service is pretty quick and the food is nice and hot. I've tried three different crepes there and every single one of them has been top notch. The pricing is also pretty decent relative to other crepe places around town. The food is incredible, but the only criticism I have is that the staff at the check out could have been a little more friendly."}
{"text":"I've been here on multiple occasions and have always had good crepes! At times they can be overstated, but always good.   My only feedback is going to seem odd but in true market fashion they should skip the calling numbers scheme and drop off the food using table numbers. The market is ideal for getting the best of everything from various other businesses and finding a table can be a challenge. It would be nice if the food was brought to you so you can enjoy your coffee or beer without having to leave your laptop alone."}
{"text":"When we walked in, the staff wasnt responsive.  There was no \"welcome\" or \"how are you.\"  Then when it came time to order, there were no recommendations, just a blank stare from behind the counter.  The food was good.  I ordered the Americana and my wife the samosa.  I was surprise that the meat they used for my Americana was deli meat not cooked in store. The prices were also very shocking. I can't understand how they justifiably  came up with those price points especially when nothing is made in house.  It was a okay experience.  I don't think I'll be back here for a while."}
{"text":"So glad Hazelnuts opened in the market. The market is one of my favorite places in Charlotte and now I have delicious crepes to eat with my coffee. They have a wide selection of crepes to choose from, I have only indulged the breakfast crepes but I know people who have had the sweet crepes and really enjoyed them as well. The jalapeno cream is something you should add to every crepe you are eating!"}
{"text":"And to think we were going to pass this place up for an Italian restaurant across the street.  This ended up being a pleasant surprise. They have a wonderful menu of crepes, prepared in various ways, that are absolutely delicious!  I had the French Toast crepe, but swapped out the whipped cream for ice cream. I think a rave party started in my mouth after the first bite!  No, seriously!   Hazelnut CafÃ© is well worth the visit and I bet you won't be able to just have one! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Had the banana Nutella, good but not mind blowing, atmosphere of the place being in a hotel was weird"}
{"text":"I love this place.  More than a quarter of the menu is delicious vegetarian choices. The crepes are large.  This is not a snack, it is a meal.  It is on the ground floor of an office building, which seemed a little strange.  But, it IS on Tryon Street so that is very practical."}
{"text":"They have HUGE, delicious sweet and savory crepes.  PLENTY of vegetarian choices.  I am more likely to be unable to finish my crepe than to need extras of anything,"}
{"text":"Another successful family visit to 7th street market. Hazelnut Creperie - 4 people, 4 crepes. 2 x Creme de la crepes, 1 Mariachi, 1 Chicken Curry - supplemented with NJC coffee. Delicious... Must try."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! I've never had a crepe before until trying hazelnuts.  Surprisingly my favorite crepes aren't the sweet ones, but the savory ones.   They have a bunch of options on the menu (10+) so there's something for everyone. You can't go wrong with the pesto chicken and the southwestern veggie. The southwestern is amazing and is hands down my favorite one!!!  For dessert you must try the Nutella and strawberry crepe. It's too tasty!"}
{"text":"Great little creperie! My wife and I ate here for the first time on a Saturday morning at 8:30 after reading the excellent Yelp reviews and will definitely return. We split the Chevre & Mozz breakfast crepe for $8.75 (loaded with Egg, Mozzarella, Bacon, Mushrooms, Red Onion, Kalamata Olives & Goat Cheese) and the Berry Delight sweet crepe for $8.50 (Strawberries, Goat Cheese & Crushed Walnuts Drizzled With Honey, Topped With Powdered Sugar).   This salty and sweet combo was a perfect breakfast mix and the goat cheese on both was a highlight for us. (For those goat cheese haters/skeptics... just give it a try, I dare you!) Unlike other small creperies, this one has six creperie stones which ensured a quick delivery of our order. The crepes themselves are superb and the eclectic mic of ingredients are fresh nicely distributed. We were skeptical about the coffee but it also turned out to be quite good at $2.65 a cup.  Seating is a little tight but it's available inside and out. Atmosphere is simple but clean and attractive. The young crew that was working were focused on their job and were friendly. Sanitation score was a 98 and, being sticklers on the topic, we were pleased to witness them all to be very conscientious hand washers and glove wearers and off their cell phones (don't laugh, that last one has become very nasty, yet overlooked, problem.)  Although I rarely do this after only one visit, I can't find any reason not to give it 5 stars. I'm not quite ready to call it one of my Gotta Tries, but I'm close. That will depend on my next visit, which will be soon.         sweet crepe"}
{"text":"Had no idea what to except and we were floored. The staff was so helpful in helping us choose from an array of crepes. The food was reasonably priced and delicious!"}
{"text":"I tried this place out because of the yelp reviews, and I wasn't disappointed at all. My veggie crepe was simply delicious. As a newcomer to Charlotte, I am glad to have found it. The staff was friendly and quick with my order."}
{"text":"Quite delicious. I've never had a chipotle veggie crÃªpe but I'm so glad I did. Prices are a little up there, but they make it worth it. Staff was friendly and professional."}
{"text":"I am so happy that I went to Hazelnuts Creperie for lunch today!  I have walked past this place countless times, but today I took the turn and went inside.  Located in the lobby of 200 S. Tryon, the venue is nothing to write home about.  Fortunately, the food is.  They have a number of breakfast, savory and sweet crepe options.  Plenty of vegetarian options too.  Once you place your order at the counter, you get a buzzer to indicate when your food is done.  My friend and I both ordered crepes, it took about 5 minutes from the time we placed the order until it was ready.  The crepes were filled with delicious veggies, chicken, cheese and sauces - plenty for a full lunch.    Next time you're walking by, do yourself a favor and turn into the lobby and discover some delicousness!"}
{"text":"Quick service with a large vegetarian friendly menu. Ingredients were fresh and food is cooked to order. The only thing is location, it's pretty much in the lobby of a building with seating kind of pushed to the side. For the quality of the food, it'd be better in a nicer atmosphere. Definitely a good value for your money. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I ordered the Lemon Drop Crepe. On Saturday they already had crepes pre cooked. The cashier was nice enough to make a fresh one. My crepe was meh. I did not finish it because it was soggy."}
{"text":"Fantastic crepes n service with a smile. A definite not to miss if ur in downtown Charlotte."}
{"text":"Big crepes! Me and son had breakfast crepes and they were excellent. Service was good, long line but moved fairly fast. This is a quick food joint but the food is better than fast food in my opinion. Paper plates and plastic silverware are what keep me from 5 stars. A good place for different quick breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Recently had a real desire for a dessert crepe - yelped to see what was near and decided on this location.  I had the strawberry/walnut/feta cheese crepe, which was quite good.  It was dusted with powdered sugar, but yet was not too sweet - possibly the addition of walnuts and feta cheese kept the balance.  Ate outside at one of the tables and had a nice relaxing break from the world.  Inside, it does feel a little like a fast food place."}
{"text":"A must stop if YOU are in this area. We got sweet crepes with Nutella, fresh fruits and ice cream. Tasty!"}
{"text":"The fiancÃ© found this place and we decided to check it out for breakfast before the big game in Charlotte. The place is a bit of a hidden gem as it is tucked away in a lobby of a building. A lady had to let us in since the door is locked on the weekends.  We checked out the menu which has a great selection of savory and sweet crepes. I ordered the maple dream - a breakfast crepe full of eggs, bacon, cheddar, maple syrup. It was amazing! It let so satisfied as I got sweet and savory bites for breakfast. The fiancÃ© got the creme de la crepe - a dessert crepe of strawberries and nutella. It was good as well, but too sweet for me at breakfast time.   I got to witness some excellent customer service while we ate. A guy was waiting for his order and the place realized they shorted him an order. He didn't make it a big deal, but the lady working made sure it was the next one completed as well as gave them another sweet crepe of their choice for no charge.  Great food and great service for a not so obvious place to eat."}
{"text":"Addicted to these crepes! Everything on the menu is amazing and the staff is extremely friendly! If you have the time and if you're nearby, stop in here and try a crepe!"}
{"text":"I found Hazelnuts Creperie to be grossly overpriced for average crepes. Visiting 7th Street Market on a Friday morning, I was excited to try as many \"breakfast\" vendors as possible to get the full experience. Of course the creperie caught my eye (I'm my grandma's child, what can I say?! She's given me her love of crepes!) and I walked up to pick from the wide crepe selection. I was a little surprised by the high prices initially, but assumed they must be stellar crepes. I chose a sweet crepe, to pair with a sammy from Loaf, and went with the classic \"Nutella banana\" (at a whopping $6.75--$7.31 with tax and addition change for syrup!!). I'm surprised to see a photo uploaded by another Yelper from four months ago showing that the prices have gone up $1! Yikes!  Crepes were already made and stacked in a pile ready to go. The market wasn't busy when I arrived, and during my time eating only one other crepe was ordered. Crepes were warm, but you could tell they'd been sitting in the open air. I certainly don't mind waiting for fresh food, but apparently they were expecting a crowd that morning. The Nutella banana crepe was nothing you couldn't make at home (I've got a great crepe recipe!) It was an okay experience, but one that I wouldn't pay that much to have again."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this gem on my way to the Carolina Panthers game this weekend....Amazing Creps!   Also, doesn't hurt being sat next to Michael Jordan while you are enjoying your breakfast!"}
{"text":"Got the lemon drop with \"fresh lemon juice\" umm no.  A squeeze bottle of juice.  Shady attitude from the staff and long wait, no one was in the place.  I understand crepe take a minute or two to cook but 20? Bye Hazelnut's, not worth the effort waiting while you muck about."}
{"text":"I seriously love this place! Best crepes in Charlotte & they're not too pricey. The only thing that sucks is having to pay for parking but it's totally worth it. The people are friendly too! You won't be disappointed. I would go everyday if I could!"}
{"text":"Fantastic, beautiful crepes.. we 3 shared a banana split crepe and it was awesome and not too sweet. Can't wait to come back for savory and breakfast crepes!!"}
{"text":"I was in the area and craving something sweet. This place came up on yelp and I decided to try it out. I was kind of full from lunch but still craving dessert so I tried the Lemon Drop Crepe. This was something light but so delicious. I really enjoyed the flavor! I don't live in Charlotte so I'm not sure if I'll be back to try other flavors but the experience I did have while here was very satisfying."}
{"text":"Second 5 star rating that I am providing in a week, and don't hand these type ratings out like candy. I had the Maple Dream and it had to be one of the best breakfast meals I have ever eaten. This place is tucked away on the ground floor of a downtown Charlotte office building on 3rd & Tryon. Must visit if you are ever in town and want something different for breakfast."}
{"text":"A great place to grab a mid morning or early afternoon meal. The staff was friendly and helpful for those who are first timers. They have a wide variety of sweet and savory crepes and were willing to make any modification to meet dietary restrictions. I highly recommend stopping by if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I love their crepes.  I'm addicted!  The breakfast and dessert crepes are my favorite but it is so hard to choose.  Keep up the good work and the great customer service."}
{"text":"I love Hazelnuts Creperie! Best crepes I've had, even better than so in Paris. Definitely worth a visit. Atmosphere is nothing special, just tucked in an office building lobby, but the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"Just like the location a few blocks away, I love this place! I have not had the dessert crepes but have had several of the savory crepes and they are always excellent. Good for lunch or dinner to take home after work."}
{"text":"Absolutely the Best Crepes I've had in Charlotte.  The Maple Dream is perfection in a Crepe.  I would highly recommend for breakfast, a little unusual setting but the food is great."}
{"text":"I always get the chicken curry one and it is the best!!!!  They are filled to capacity and since I work uptown and park in 7th street station I'm right next door to the fresh market. I guess I should try a dessert crepe now:-)"}
{"text":"This food was really great I had the breakfast crepe called the maple dream and boy was it worth the 10 min wait"}
{"text":"I was put off at first by the location here... I thought \"oh crap. Hotel buffet...no thanks\", but we'd already paid for parking and my friend had a plane to catch.  We sat down and I had the Americana. Wow. Spectacular.  My friend finished his meal off with a dessert crepe and gave me a taste... Good grief. Really really good - topped off by super friendly staff...with senses of humor! Score!"}
{"text":"Yum!!! I am so so glad they opened a hazelnuts right in Blakeney! I haven't had a single thing that I didn't like. Our current favorites are the curry chicken, the thai chicken, and the maple dream but next time we go, I'm trying something on the veggie side. It's a simple concept and they execute it perfectly! Don't be afraid to ask for things on the side (like maple syrup). The service is excellent too with really friendly staff and a clean and quaint sitting area."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness....can you say delicious! What a treat that we now have a location nearby! Crepes sweet or savory are so yummy!"}
{"text":"Oh, my goodness! That's exactly what you'll say when you visit this amazing little breakfast place hidden inside a bank lobby in Uptown Charlotte, I discovered this little gem. If you've never had a crepe before, this is the perfect place to come. If you already love crepes, it's still the place to come. Sweet, savory, it does t matter. They're all good! I had the Maple Dream with eggs, cheese and bacon tucked inside the fluffiest crepe I've ever had, with just the right amount of maple syrup and a dusting of powdered sugar on top. If you're in Charlotte, this is a must stop."}
{"text":"Great portion sizes, big enough to share! Do wish they'd use real plates rather than paper. This was our 2nd trip and we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Omg, this place was amazing.  Went with some friends and thought the atmosphere was weird but the crepes made up for it..especially the Smores crepe with a scoop of ice cream!   Totally worth going:)"}
{"text":"Hazelnuts serves very good food. I had a great vegetarian crepe -- it was one of a handful that they offered.  My biggest disappointment with my visit to this Hazelnuts is that the other Hazelnuts is in a much more exciting place. I was visiting Charlotte and figured the most reviewed Hazelnuts would be the best one. I went to this one on the weekend, and it (and the streets outside) was dead. Later I saw the other Hazelnuts, which is in a much more fun place (7th Street Public Market). If you're a tourist or just not in a hurry, go to the other one."}
{"text":"Okay if u want a sit down and be served breakfast this isn't it. But if all you want are delicious things to put in your mouth... this is the place. Its located in a bank building with food court type seating. We had a crepe with turkey and bacon and chipotle aioli and it was just amazing and packed with flavor. For a sweet ending we had a berries delight with strawberries goat cheese and walnuts drizzled in honey.... whaaaat? So yummy"}
{"text":"Went here for Sunday brunch with a friend.  It wasnt packed and in a cozy corner.  It was great! At first i was a little crestfallen atthe prices (8-10$) for a crepe but the portion sizes made up for it! Largest crepes ive ever had and very good!   They have a great variety of breakfast, savory and sweet crepes."}
{"text":"Love this place! I'm not into sweets that much but I experience their Mariachi Crepe .... ohh My it was excellent it was sooo good I will come back to Charlotte just for their Crepes. The service was phenomenal those girls make u feel like you at home."}
{"text":"Iyana gives amazing customer service to me every time I go here! I can't imagine this place without her. She really takes charge of the line to make sure everything is done fast and correctly. The food is amazing and fresh. Thank you to everyone here for your amazing service and food!"}
{"text":"Best crepe I've ever had.  The Maple Dream is the perfect combination of sweet and savory.  Are you ever torn between your Nutella crepe and grabbing a real breakfast ?  Those days are now over and thank god for that!"}
{"text":"Awesome.  Maple dream is the greatest crepe on planet earth.  Please go.  Do it for me !"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The location in Uptown is great because it's very walkable but it can be kinda tricky to spot since it's in one of the corporate centers. I've never had a crepe before and this was delicious! The place even smells amazing. I had the breakfast Americana but they also serve lunch crepes and dessert ones as well. Definitely on my list of favorite breakfast places in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Pretty solid spot for lunch! Hazelnuts is located in the lobby of the building, I walked by it at first and then followed the delicious smells to find them! I went with the Basil Pesto Chicken crepe and while I asked for it without red onion it still came with the red onion. I thought the crepe was tasty, but I couldn't really taste the goat cheese, mostly just the mozzarella. Next time I'd probably go with the buffalo chicken crepe. I didn't get a chance to try the dessert crepes which in hindsight is such a shame, I freaking love a dessert crepe.   The employees were very friendly and patient while I narrowed down my crepe choices. The crepes aren't super fast, so plan to add a bit of time in while you wait for your tasty lunch to be ready!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! It was a little hard to find since we had no idea it was inside an office building.   My husband got The Mariachi and I got crepes with strawberries and whip cream. Both were very good, I even liked my husbands more!   This is a definite must try breakfast spot! Staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Sweet, savory, breakfast and vegetarian crepes galore! My curry chicken had just the right amount of spice with the curry sauce and mango chutney and I'll admit that the romaine lettuce provided a nice contrasting light crunch with every other bite. The pager system makes it easy to walk around the rest of the market or sit down to enjoy conversation with friends along with your beverage from Not Just Coffee or Tank's Tap.  Really, if you can't find something you like at Hazelnut's, then you just don't like food. Reasonable prices and quick service. Like every business in the 7th Street Market, there is plenty of opportunity for people-watching and easy parking in the garage, just make sure to find the little validation machine behind Viva Raw before leaving."}
{"text":"I saw this on Yelp and my fellow Yelpers didn't let me down. This was a great value for a nice lunch. My wife got the Chicken with Basil and I got the chicken curry crepe. Both were excellent!  I think many people think of a sweet crepe (which they have, as well), but the savory crepes are a great alternative to a sandwich.  Nice alternative!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to when i need something fast and filling.  Everything is so customizable, but \"The American\" has gotta be my favorite, with egg, avocado, cheddar, turkey, and spinach.  As long as there is cheese involved, you really can't go wrong."}
{"text":"This little craperie is right in the lobby of the 200 S Tryon St building, just walk in and head right, you will see it!  It is very clean and easy to figure out.   I came here for breakfast and got the spicy feta crepe, it is vegetarian with a spicy green jalapeno sauce.  AHH, so good, I wish I could have another right now!!  The prices are on par compared to most other creperies I've been too. And the service is speedy, order and they start making it right away!  I have recommended this to all my friends for their early breakfast!"}
{"text":"Small, counter-order place in the lobby of the building next to McCormick and Schmick's. I walk past it all the time during the week, and the fella and I decided to check it out for breakfast one Sunday morning. It was actually pretty busy at 9:00 a.m. - who knew?  The fella got the Maple Dream (scrambled egg, cheddar and bacon with maple syrup), and I got The Chunkster (peanut butter, banana, chocolate chips, trail mix, and maple syrup), which also describes me after eating it. After all the hullabaloo about the Maple Dream, I have to say that we both decided The Chunkster was better. There wasn't enough meat in the Maple Dream, and The Chunkster was deeeelicious! About halfway through, it started to almost be too sweet/rich, but I pushed through.   I'd love to try Hazelnuts again for a savory crepe at lunch or another sweet crepe. Great service, casual feel, tasty crepes, and breakfast for two for only $20. Oh, and their coffee was pretty darn delicious, too!"}
{"text":"This place was fantastic, and even though it's in the lobby of a skyscraper it's really a great place to go grab a bite to eat.  They offer both sweet and savory crepes, and you can completely customize them to your liking. The staff were friendly, and were really helpful for a first timer like myself."}
{"text":"So I'm in Charlotte for a night and when I wake up I'm hungry but I don't want hotel food so I check my trusty Yelp app and find Hazelnuts. Nestled in a lobby away from the busy streets is this awesome little crepe place that is clean and bright and inviting. The menu is concise and your options are straightforward. The Maple Dream is not just the best crepe I've ever had, it's the best breakfast I've ever had."}
{"text":"OMG the food is amazing. I had the curry chicken crepe. It was to die for. I am placing another order to take home."}
{"text":"This restaurant's South Tryon Street location is tucked inside the lobby of a building. It is pretty popular during lunch (as their hours are only 8 am to 3 pm, unless you go to the East 7th Street location that is open until 8 pm on most nights). I love this spot for lunch during a workday! You can get your crepes to-go or dine-in. I recommend getting a savory and a sweet for the best of both worlds. These people really know how to make a well-balanced, lip-smacking crepe! The Maple Dream breakfast crepe is always my go-to breakfast crepe, and then any dessert crepe with Nutella, strawberries and bananas is always a sure win for me!"}
{"text":"Delicious and affordable crepes in the Charlotte uptown area! Hazelnuts Creperie is a small cafÃ©-sized restaurant tucked into a much larger building. Even though there's only two tables in the creperie, there's a whole bunch of tables and chairs nearby so they can accommodate for large groups too. Whether you're craving a savory or dessert crepe, all of their choices are solid. I went with the curry chicken crepe for breakfast, and I loved it. (Their other most popular choice is the Maple Dream.) Either way, I don't think it's possible to go wrong with any of their large, filling crepes for $7-8!"}
{"text":"As stated in my previous review, we went back to try more crepes before my friend and I left town. We again split two crepes - the Maple Dream and the Banana Berry Cinn.  The flavor combinations were perfect.  Fresh, flavorful and absolutely delicious!  They offer savory, sweet and breakfast crepes.  There are a large number of veggie options too.  Affordable and delectable.  Just wish my stay had been longer...I probably would have gone back to try the Chicken Curry crepe.  It sounds amazing too."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! Crepes can be made gluten feee, and you have options to fill with meats, veggies, and sweets! I had the chipotle chicken, and crepe was just so light and delicious, and the filling with chicken and salad was so fresh! Also tried the chicken basil, equally delicious. Food comes out pretty quick considering they make it fresh in front of you.   Plenty of room to sit inside and eat for groups of 4, and some tables outside. They use beepers to let you know when it's ready. Wish they had a place like this up in NY. Already want to go here again, try this place!"}
{"text":"Totally addicted to this place. Owner is super nice and needs to extend his hours. Best crepes I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Yummy yummy lemon drop and the strawberry with goat cheese was amazing too. Service was wonderful!"}
{"text":"I came to Hazelnuts for lunch on a Monday. By 1:30 the place was pretty empty, though there does seem to be plenty of seating. It is located on the ground floor of a business building in a lobby area. The food was good, I enjoyed a curry crepe however it was priced a little bit steep. Also, there was a small child playing in the seating area (I assume the owner's son?) with canned drinks and silverware from the restaurant. I only hope that the items were not placed back on the shelf for customers to use."}
{"text":"Not the most healthiest lunch option but they are sooooo good. I've tried the Maple Dream, Americana, and Banana Berry Cinn. Each full of deliciousness that can lead to addiction. I honestly need to be more self-controlled when it comes to this place since I want to eat there everyday.  It's worth the $7-10 per large crepe. Sometimes I eat half and save the other half for later.   Beware of the lunch time rush. The wait can be long and seating limited, so plan accordingly. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Absolutely yummy! I had the s'mores crepe, my sister got the dream and my cousin got the pig and swiss... I had a taste of each and it makes it that much harder to decide what to get next time in town! Staff was very friendly and a short wait. It's worth going to!"}
{"text":"This is the new fav place for me and my Family!  U cannot go wrong with any item on the menu. Everything is made top quality and fresh. The whole staff is friendly and kind. Each time we have been here, I noticed Aaron goes out of his way to make sure each and every customer is happy. I would rate this 10 star out if 5!!"}
{"text":"I just moved to the area and asked around what one of the best breakfast places was.  Two names kept being mentioned Jack Beagles and Hazelnuts.  Hazelnuts did not disappoint!  I got their chÃ¨vre and mozz and the banana split.  I left in a food coma, and gladly so!  Though I am really picky about giving out way to many 5 stars this one deserves it due to the quality and price!  I just moved from the west palm beach area and a crepe breakfast at a French restaurant there would easily have been twice as expensive."}
{"text":"Best crepes I've ever had! I'm not even a big fan of crepes! We had a variety of sweet and savory crepes. They have a great selection. The chipotle chicken was so good we had to order a second one. The crepes are a good size and I truly appreciated the crepe to filling ratio. I've gone to some high end creperies and the balance was extremely mediocre. It's nice to see that this little shop inside of a hotel/residency has got their act together versus some long time stand alone places! Hopefully Hazelnut will expand in the future. I could see this chain in a lot of places if it isn't already!"}
{"text":"So many options in this Market Place, but we decided to try something a little different. They have many options including a vegetarian menu and a dessert menu. The prices seem fair but they definitely skimp on the meats.    I ordered the BASIL PESTO CHICKEN, Chicken, Mozzarella, Basil Pesto, Tomato, Red Onion & Goat Cheese. The goat cheese was horrible! I hated it! And the fact that there was such a small portion of chicken in my crepe made it worse.    The Curry Chicken Crepe was delicious! It seemed to have a more generous portion of chicken and had great mild flavor of curry. Overall it wasn't bad, but should definitely load those crepes with generous portions of meat!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food. There's a lot of different crepes on the menu and you're bound to find something that you will like! The place is tucked away inside a hotel. You'll have to take a right after you walk into the lobby.   I walked in, and the employees were super welcoming! My friend and I were debating over which to get, and one employee (I wish I knew his name, but he's a big black guy -- he's awesome!) was helping us out. I ended up picking the Maple Dream. When my friend and I were deciding what to get, I mentioned to her that I loved bacon. The guy who made my crepe mentioned that he added extra bacon to my crepe!!! He also asked if I wanted cinnamon on my crepe!  The crepe was SOOOO GOOD! It was sweet and salty. The crepe itself was very soft, and the fillings were  very flavorful. 10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"The crepes were delicious & the service was pretty quick. We enjoyed our experience here. They have an interesting menu and are fairly priced. Also has a nice atmosphere! Go !"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat for brunch they have the best crepes in the city,Customer service is great they have a variety to choose from..I eat the sweet ones for dessert"}
{"text":"Sooooooo tasty. The Maple Dream is the most popular breakfast item on the menu and it's not hard to see why. Bacon, cheddar cheese crepe covered in warm maple syrup? Simplistic bliss. There are other dessert, savory and vegetarian crepes that I'm sure are awesome, but I can't get past that Maple Dream."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh.  I went out searching for some breakfast this AM in Uptown and stumbled across a sign outside the building.  I tried the Maple Dream (and it was definitely dreamy).  I will be back to try the numerous other crepes on the menu for sure!  The woman working was very helpful, gave great recommendations, and was very friendly.  Quick, excellent service!"}
{"text":"The savory crepes are delicious, definitely worth visiting this place. Ours had cheese and bacon in it with maple syrup on top. A friend ordered an Indian inspired crepe and loved it."}
{"text":"I had brunch here with the kids and loved it! I always passed by in a rush to get somewhere else uptown and would promise myself that I'd go soon. I finally made good and I'm glad I did. They have a nice assortment of sweet, savory, and breakfast crepes all for a decent price. I got the Chevre and Mozz which included goat cheese and kalamata olives! Wow! Love at 1st bite. The crepe itself was golden, flaky deliciousness. The filling was just right and the simple presentation let me get right to the business of devouring my meal (hence, no pictures). I will definitely return for something sweet next time."}
{"text":"Mmm... tasty crepes... 5 stars for breakfast, 4 stars for sweet, 3 stars for savory. I really want to love this place, but I find myself disappointed when they can't or won't make the breakfast crepes all day long. Why do you torture me with the sign outside touting my favorite, the \"Maple Dream,\" if I can't have it? Anyway, the Maple Dream is seriously delicious and I would eat one every day, but I find some of their savory crepes to be only marginally better than my packed sandwich from home. I had the BBQ Chicken Crepe today and it was definitely oversauced - like drinking sweet tomato based bbq sauce with a little bit of cheddar, raw onion, and tiny chicken bits floating by. The Turkey BLT Crepe I tried last week was alright, except for the lettuce inside . This is weird texturally and I need to remember to ask for no lettuce. It's a chilled, crunchy lettuce in the middle of an otherwise warm, gooey, meaty, cheesy filling. Overall, I lovelovelove the breakfast crepes and really enjoy the sweet crepes, but think the 3-4 kinds of savory crepes I've tried so far all fall into \"fancy Hot Pocket\" territory."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness this place was AMAZING! My group and I each tried a different crepe. I had the Smoked BLT, which was completely satisfying in every way. We tried the Curry Crepe (spicy version) which a had a perfectly balanced taste that I would try again! And again! We also had the Berry Cinn crepe which was our sweet crepe. The cinnamon and the strawberries set this one apart from their banana and hazelnut crepe adding quite a bit more flavor. We LOVED this place and its location because it had all of these little market shops around it, which we walked around and shopped at after eating. Also had coffee from Not Just Coffee.  This place is great for families, friends, dates, and exploring the city. It's somewhat pricey ($7.99 for a crepe) but they're big and quite filling and well worth the price. We can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I was in Charlotte with family for the NCAA. By the time we got going our first morning breakfast at most places was over. So I went on my trusty Yelp app. & found this place with high reviews and within walking distance of our hotel. The four of us got different crÃªpes, maple dream for most of us, a build your own for my daughter and then we got a sweet one (including fresh fruit and Nutella to share!) oh my! these crÃªpes were absolutely delicious!!! The Mape Dream: A combination of crispy bacon, eggs,melted cheddar in a perfectly warm delicious crÃªpe, covered with maple syrup,a pat of real butter and lightly dusted with confectioners' sugar...was enough to make you..well  go back the next morning for more!!! And that is exactly what we did!!My daughters crÃªpe was equally delicious. She had bacon, eggs, mozzarella, fresh spinach & sweet red onions. The Sweet CrÃªpe we got had sliced bananas, fresh strawberries, Nutella and fresh whipped  cream and powdered sugar on top!!! What is not to like about this! This place is actually in the first floor of an office building (look for the sign out side) and yes you can sit down and eat your crÃªpes there, or do as we did and got it \"to go\"and went and found a nice outdoor spot to enjoy the warm sun. Another thing about this place was the young people that worked behind the counter (taking the orders and making the crÃªpes) they had to have been some of the nicest people we met in Charlotte!  We are definitely heading to hazelnuts crÃªperie next time we go to Charlotte!!!"}
{"text":"One of the first places we ate when coming to Charlotte. We love going coming here on the weekend, having a coffee and breakfast. Huge selection of food, so you can have breakfast, lunch, dinner and it's always a good fit. Just have to be in the mood for a crepe.   Recommend everyone gives it a try."}
{"text":"I am glad that blakney has another restaurant to eat at. It needed it. The crepes were good. I got the berry delight and it was delicious. My only issue with the place is the seating situation. It is a small restaurant so they don't have a lot of space to work with. The employees were constantly sliding tables around to accommodate the patrons coming in. We were asked to move our seats and slide our table to one side and the other as people came and left. The tables were practically right on top of each other so when it is busy you feel like you are sitting really close to the people next to you. It was chaotic to say the least. I enjoyed the food and the style of the restaurant was nice, but this is not a good place to bring groups. 2-4 people tops! It is way too small and too busy for more than that. I felt like I had to eat and get up fast because there were lots of people waiting for us to leave so they could sit down. Overall, I would come here again. I thought the food and the price was good. I just really hope they figure out a better seating situation so the dining experience could be more enjoyable."}
{"text":"This is my children's favorite brunch spot on the weekends! It's fast and filling but not too heavy. They go for the sweet ones but I go for savory bfast. Every single thing on the menu is delicious!"}
{"text":"Crepes are seriously out of this world.  I wish I could start my day with one everyday!  Fun brunch spot."}
{"text":"Maple dream was awesome. I never would have put these ingredients together and topped with maple syrup. Very tasty.  Restaurant is located in the lobby of 200 South Tryon St."}
{"text":"Got an Americana and a Creme de la Crepe. They were both very good and HUGE. Much larger than I expected. I had to take the dessert one to go as the savory one filled me up. The seating is a little crowded around lunch time and it did take about 5-10 minutes to get the crepe but no unexpected wait. The staff was very efficient and helpful. Expect to spend about $7-$10 per crepe but you do get a large portion."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a small town feel and a big town this is the place. Yes the seating area is small but fantastic for food on the go. This is not your costco, Walmart size place. There is an Ihop down the road Chelsea C they can accommodate you.  I haven't tried all of the varieties but plan too each time I return. You guys rock!!!"}
{"text":"Well, I wasn't really expecting to love it. I'm forever locked into that constant struggle where I love big meals but I'm trying not to LOOK like I love big meals. In my head, I know that a lunch crepe would be a good lunch. But then the stomach gets involved and I feel wary that I'll still be hungry when the meal is over.  The good news is that I loved it. Enough food to be satisfied but not enough to bring on the post-food coma.  I have tried a buffalo chicken crepe and a curry crepe.  The curry one was easily the best of the two, but both were very good. Watch out for the lunch rush, seating is pretty limited here."}
{"text":"The employees were so friendly in helping us pick out our order! We got a maple breakfast crepe and a basil chicken pesto crepe. They were good, but I think I we would've enjoyed the dessert crepes more."}
{"text":"Very casual easy going place.  The crepes are fresh and are well made.  They have both sweet and savory options  Would definitely come back when in town."}
{"text":"Impressive selection of crepes both savory and sweet. Had the Santorini for breakfast. Just like a Greek omelet in a crepe - was bursting with spinach, mushrooms, kalamata olives, onion and feta!! Delicious! Everyone was helpful and in a good mood. Took about 10 minutes but was well worth the wait."}
{"text":"This review will be fairly short.  I love your crepes - both savory and sweet - your reasonable prices. I love having you as an alternate choice in the super awesome 7th street market. When not just coffee had a line out the door, you provided me with two delicious piping hot coffees and a bottle of OJ for just $4.02. And for that I say thank you. Love ya, mean it!!"}
{"text":"This is a small, no-nonsense creperie with a wide selection of items. I wanted to get something light and the associate at the counter was able to convert their Florentine Crepe into an omelet for me. The portion size was more than sufficient and the food tasted fresh. It's a great spot--very clean and they use compostable and recyclable cups, plates etc."}
{"text":"I woke up at my hotel and found the breakfast there...well wasn't the most appetizing.  I Yelp'd Hazelnuts and   found this place to be rated one of the highest breakfast places to go in Charlotte.  Upon walking in, it has a very cafe-ish/Au Bon Pain feel.  The music is soothing, all sorts of people coming in and out.  You can see the staff make your breakfast.  Super cool to see everything made in front of you.  I got the Americana crepe.  It was probably one of the best crepes I've had.  Light and fluffy at the same time, I can't really explain it.  You'll just need to try it to understand it.  The inside is very nice, I see several people chatting, reading a book or like myself on a laptop.  People aren't overly loud and aware of the surroundings.  Super plus!  Good place for breakfast and food is mighty tasty.  If you're in the mood for crepes,I would recommend Hazelnuts without a doubt."}
{"text":"A fine spot for a weekend breakfast at a reasonable price.  Nothing to write home about, but a good meal.  There are very few options Uptown Charlotte..."}
{"text":"The crepes were light and the ingredients fresh. I ordered the Pig and Swiss and it was delicious. Recommend as a breakfast item."}
{"text":"The crepes were delicious! My fiancÃ© and I loved our food! The only downside was the person who took our order forgot to make all the customer's coffee and we had to wait 15 min extra for it. The coffee was good though, definitely potent!"}
{"text":"Not a cozy atmosphere, but delicious and creative crepes! Definitely recommend, just don't expect a cozy coffee shop."}
{"text":"Never had a stuffed crepe before, utterly amazing.  I would recommend this place, fast service."}
{"text":"Amazing crepes but the wait is long. It's a popular place for brunch. It has extensive menu of sweet or savory crepes. I tried both and it didn't disappoint. It's located inside an office building with lobby go to your right once you enter the building and you will see the Seats and little corner where you can order. A lot of people get it to go but you can sit there too, not a lot of place to sit but it's an option. The employees are nice and attentive. I will recommend this place for a quick bite for breakfast or brunch."}
{"text":"This place is in a lobby so make sure you walk around to find it. Trust me, it would be worth ur extra minutes.   So I got southwestern veggie and forgot to tell them not to put sour cream which I do not like. I'm glad I forgot, because the crepes was so full of flavor. It was like having a dance party of favors in your month. Perfect size and worth the price.  If I'm going to Charlotte again, I'm definitely hunting this place down again."}
{"text":"I was in charlotte for a business trip and stumbled upon Hazelnuts creperie and decided to have lunch here. I personally love dessert crepes, but tried the breakfast crepe and the chipotle chicken crepe. both crepes were amazing! the crepes had just the right amount of crisp on the outside and softer towards the enter. All the lettuces, tomatoes and avocados tasted super fresh and light. The sauce they used were also very delicious and went well with the rest of the crepe. the portion looked pretty big, but even after finishing it I didn't feel overly stuff and was very satisfied. The place is pretty spacious and can seat small groups of people, but probably not a huge party. The place is also very clean and modern which i loved. I need to come back to try their sweet dessert crepes!"}
{"text":"I never had one but absolutely enjoyed it. They are bursting with flavor. If you do t have a big appetite then or one and split it. They are pretty big. The ladies were patient with us newbies and overall it was a great choice. We will be back."}
{"text":"Never did I think a creperie would find itself as a considerable lunch option but Hazelnut Creperie proved me wrong. Great options for sweet AND savory crepes and I have not had a crepe I didn't like here so advise on going with your gut on this one lol  2Â¢- Curry Chicken and Basil Thai stand out amongst the savory crepes"}
{"text":"Wow so good,  awesome menu of goodness,  I mean I've had crepes before but there are some awesome possibilities here.   It's possible to go totatly bad and chocolate all the way or healthier it's up to you to how naughty you want to be with.    service was good, and food came out quick."}
{"text":"Yum. Yum. Yum. I ordered The Chunkster. The crepe was much larger than I was expecting so I had to put almost half of it in a to go box. It was so delicious that I wish there was one located near me in Raleigh. I will definitely be back when I return to Charlotte!"}
{"text":"So disappointing. I flew into Charlotte this morning for a short business trip. My flight landed at 6:45 AM and I had planned it for days to go right to this craperie before my meeting. I chose it specifically because I cannot eat gluten and was so pleasantly surprised that Charlotte had a gluten-free creperie. On their menu online, it says the offer gluten-free crepes. My whole flight I was looking forward to it. I found parking two blocks away, walked those two blocks, entered the store, only to find out they don't serve gluten-free crepes at the location I went to. There was no mention of this on the website. So,  not only did I pay for parking, not get breakfast because now I'm late for my meeting, but I'm not going to get the crepes I do looked forward to. Poor business to mislead customers and cause them to have their day thrown off because of negligence to put correct info on the website."}
{"text":"This place was an EXCELLENT choice for breakfast.  Only crepes served, so no side orders of bacon, eggs,  etc. Everything modestly priced $7 - $9 per crepe, 12oz coffee less than $2 (not Starbucks,  but still pretty tasty, better than Dunkin & McDs) for sure.    For a family of 4, we got 3 different crepes to share...Maple Dream, Pig n Swiss, and Not Your French Toast. All were amazing!  My favorite was Pig n Swiss: bacon,  eggs, swiss, spinach, without the red onions. Typical items in an omelet, but much better.  My next would be the Not Your French Toast because it comes with a full serving of vanilla ice cream.  Delicious ending to a Sunday morning breakfast.   Location was pretty convenient. Uptown in the Fifth 3rd building, just up the stairs. For free parking on weekends, it couldn't get any better.  But be careful for Sunday morning cries crowds.  One of the few places open on weekends combined with free parking.    Only reason for the 4 instead of 5, is because of the wait time. It wasn't that crowded when we got there,  but it took awhile for us to get our food."}
{"text":"I can't put my finger on it but I was not impressed by this place.  It just doesn't seem like a friendly place that appreciates its customers. I ordered two crepes recently. The food is ok. Overall: MEH!"}
{"text":"The ladies were sweet and pleasant working this morning! My two girls and I LOVED the \"maple dream\" and the s'mores crepes. So delicious I wish we had one back home!!!! Thank you for all the great reviews that led us to you in the first place."}
{"text":"The best breakfast I've had in a long time. The person who helped me was very friendly. I ordered the very veggie curry and omg it was fantastic. People in my office were going nuts over the smell. A few went to get crepes because it smelled so good. I will be back soon. Such a wonderful start to my day."}
{"text":"Delicious!  We had dessert crepes but they were worth every penny.  The S'mores crepe was full of marshmallow and the banana split was a perfect mix of banana, nuts and toppings.  We highly recommend a stop here.  Next time in Charlotte we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food was so delicious, we decided to come back the next day!  Service was friendly & quick, the crepes were outrageous. We had both sweet and savory crepes (Americana, Maple Dream, Lemon Drop, Nutella Banana) and each one was excellent. I wish they had locations all over the east coast!!"}
{"text":"Great inexpensive spot to grab both sweet and savory crepes. Staff is very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"one of Charlotte's best kept secrets: Hazelnuts Creperie.  Located in the lobby of 200 S Tryon Street, it's a small cafÃ© open 8am-3pm Monday through Sunday (yes, Saturday and Sunday too!).  The menu is quite large, with over THIRTY different crepes, plus a build-your-own option.  There are eggy breakfast crepes, sweet and savory, and tons of vegetarian options.  Two of my favorite condiments, Sriracha & Nutella, are on hand and incorporated into several of the crepes.  My favorite crepe (so far) is the Chipotle Veggie:  mushrooms, black beans, cheddar, lettuce, tomato, onion, chipotle aioli, and ranch.  You have the option of adding protein to any of the crepes, and the choices include bacon, turkey, ham, chicken, and tofu."}
{"text":"Hazelnut Creperie: I am a regular visitor here and I must say that their crepes are delicious. I have always eaten in but today I had to order three crepes to-go since my girlfriend was unwell and was craving for creme de le crepe with extra whipping cream. I placed my order and repeated it twice to make sure that I don't get anything wrong.  Got my order, came back home and her crepe had no whipping cream!!! I was shocked and given her condition and mood, I was seriously disappointed with Hazelnut Creperie. They did let me down today."}
{"text":"Two words: mixed emotions. That's how I feel about this place.   My crepe (the very veggie curry) was delicious. It was a bit overcooked but the flavors worked and the ingredients were fresh. The price was reasonable for the amount of food, in my opinion.  The service, however, was... bad, simply put. I waited a good 2 minutes before anyone even acknowledged me. Then, I asked a few questions about a menu item and got a half-hearted shoulder shrug. Then, they forgot to make my order and didn't start on it until I went to check in nearly 10 minutes after I placed it. It wasn't that anyone was rude, necessarily, just apathetic. It was like they would rather be doing anything else at that given moment.  That in mind, along with the fact that the market has quite a few other food vendors to choose from, I can't really give it more than 2 stars. Next time I'm in the market, I may give it another try to see if this is an isolated thing. Hopefully it is because the food was pretty darn tasty."}
{"text":"This place seems so odd when you first walk in, it's almost cafeteria style located in the bottom of a hotel. However I was impressed. The service was helpful, friendly, and fast, they even got some giggles out of me and made my morning better. The prices are really reasonable. The crepe itself was amazing, I got the one with the three meats, cheese, and greens (can't remember the name) but it was nice and hot - served in a perfectly amazing crepe shell. They have lots of drinks to choose from (canned and bottled). I want to come back and try more considering the rave reviews about other menu items :)"}
{"text":"I had the Undo Your Thai, and just think of the toppings! This mushroomsy, Mmozzarellay veggie with chicken crepe--from the mind of Hazelnuts Creperie--is a beautiful mess, and ideal for savory lovers who want to spice up their bites, and a good way to eat to eat our veggies. Delish.  - Gluten free crepes are available. - NCGS (Non-Celiac-Gluten-Sensitivity) friendly only.  - Keep in mind all food products are made using shared equipment.  Four and Half Yelps"}
{"text":"Great little creperie! Fast, friendly service. Nice menu selection. Very clean and it has a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Loved finding this crepe stand in downtown Charlotte! The building has a packing-house, industrial feel, and there are many other options to eat at as well. My crepe had chicken, chipotle sauce, peppers, and spinach. It was a delightfully savory crepe, but still light enough to have for breakfast and not feel sluggish. They had a few scrumptious sounding dessert crepes that I would love to try when back in the area!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I happened to stroll by this place on a walk downtown and decided to visit it for breakfast the next morning. It's a cute little nook and is bursting with the smell of fresh ingredients when you walk in. Seating is ample and we had no trouble finding a place.  We opted to split the Florentine and Berry delight crepes. In most crepes I've had, the ingredients are cooked thoroughly and then the crepe is assembled; that didn't happen in this case, but it was still good. Both the savory and the sweet crepes were well-prepared and well-assembled. We'd certainly bring family or friends to this place and will likely, despite our infrequent visits to downtown, start coming more often."}
{"text":"These crepes are to die for! Very good combinations, and a large variety of items to choose from! Found my new go to breakfast stop in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I cannot wait to come home to the QC. Hazelnuts welcomed me with arms wide open! I was a piggy and had two. One with bacon egg and syrup and the other with fruit and Nutella. Almost as good as going to Paris. Almost."}
{"text":"Delicious!!  Located right downtown i the business district. If you want something sweet and yummy try this place."}
{"text":"I've only been in Charlotte for two weeks but I'm already addicted to this place! In four trips I was able to try something from every part of the menu (sweet, breakfast, savory, veggie), bringing me to the following conclusion: they do everything right.   I'm yet to have a bad experience and I especially appreciate the enormous portion sizes and friendly service. All of the ingredients taste fresh and delicious, allowing you to confidently order whatever your heart desires. There are so many menu options here as well that you really have no excuse to not come back and try other options. Whether you're craving something sweet or something savory, Hazelnuts Creperie has you covered.  The lines can understandably get a bit long during lunch, but you can call-in to place an order for pickup if you're ordering at least two crepes - helpful if you're picking up orders for colleagues! Additionally, I've noticed that the lines during breakfast hours are much shorter - if you can take some time out of your morning to swing by, I would.  One final note: the location is strangely tucked around the corner inside the lobby of an office building, although it's not difficult to find it if you follow the signage (and the scent). Don't be daunted if you don't initially see it!"}
{"text":"The crepes here were sooooo good. My wife had the buffalo chicken, while I had the smoked BLT. Super fantastic! After eating every last bite we couldn't resist one more for dessert. The banana berry cinn was the perfect way to finish off the meal. Glad Hazelnuts just opened up in Blakeney, since we're here almost every day! Can't wait to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Only downside to this restaurant is having to wait but is well worth it! I really enjoy the Thai and curry crepes which are delicious every time! Staff is hit or miss but mostly friendly."}
{"text":"So yummy! So many different options from sweet to savory, you'll definitely find something you love."}
{"text":"I work in uptown and once in a while when I feel like eating something different, i come here for lunch. They are usually pretty quick, they have good options and you can not go wrong with their sweet crepes. I like their basil pesto chicken - if you're not very hungry for lunch, i recommend this place."}
{"text":"I just had one of the best crepes I've ever eaten at Hazelnuts inside the 7th Street Market. I ordered the Curry Chicken crepe (ordered spicy, they have a mild option) and it was amazing! So flavorful and the ingredients were fresh. The crepe itself was perfect."}
{"text":"Had the Americana, mariachi, and Thai curry. All three delicious. Took out of town guests here, including a vegetarian, and they loved it."}
{"text":"Hooray - they've added more seating! Hazelnuts continues to impress me with their delicious crepes."}
{"text":"This place is top notch - we had a turkey bacon Avacado crepe from the savory menu and a create your own that just had bacon, egg, cheese, ham on it. Both were really fresh and very large. Interesting seating as its right in the lobby of a building but sound business practices."}
{"text":"The crepes were ok but the personal weren't friendly enough to make a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Although I'm usually a French toast or pancake guy, I decided to try this place since it's near my hotel.  Had their basic breakfast crepe, and it was really good.  The service was great too.  My only gripe is that they can't fry up eggs separate from the crepe, but this is because of the type of space they have in the tower, not their fault.  So, if you're into crepes, this is probably a great place with a wide variety of crepe options and combinations."}
{"text":"This place has the best crepes in all of Charlotte and you better believe it. It takes a lot to please me and I've had a lot of crepes but this place is genuinely five stars. Let me break it down, the owner is very committed and passionate about his food, in fact he makes the crepes that he serves and you can see him make them. There are a lot of selection for crepes, this place is literally ALL about crepes. We ordered both a sweet and salty crepe and they were delicious. I can tell a lot of thought process is put into the creation of the crepes and I really appreciate that. Only two problems, this place is kind of tucked inside a business building on the first floor and second, parking is hard to deal with, if you do not work uptown you will need to drive here and park at one of the paid parking garages. This place is also only a breakfast lunch place and is not open on Sundays. There is only one other crepe place in Charlotte that comes close and it is the crepe cellar, but still, the crepes at crepe cellar are way too sweet with too much nutella, this place is very hearty and is truly one of the VERY best crepes I've ever had, I am trying to come back ASAP!"}
{"text":"This is a nice little crepe shop inside a hotel, though it has limited offerings. The crepes are tasty and fresh, but everything is cooked within the crepe, providing for only a few food options for breakfast or lunch. For the price, this is a good option."}
{"text":"Amazing crepes! However it's an order at the counter type place just so you're not expecting a sit down restaurant. I was a little disappointed in their coffee selection as there was no flavoring or anything just cream and sugar."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! My favorite crepe, is hands down the smores one! We had amazing service and our crepes were ready in minutes. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The Scene: Sunday morning at the vibrant 7th Street Public Market in uptown Charlotte - front of the line at Hazelnuts CrÃªperie.   Occasion: A hungry Californian looking for a healthy breakfast in the Carolinas.   Me: \"I'd like the Santorini please.\"  This contained eggs, feta cheese, Kalamata olives, mushrooms, spinach and red onion.   Cashier: \"We offer that with feta AND mozzarella cheese. You ok with that?\"  Me: \"That taste good? (She makes a face). Then why do you offer it that way?\"  She: \"To make the crÃªpe fuller. Customers like it that way.\"   Me: \"No thanks. I'll take it with feta only. You can throw in extra olives or mushrooms or spinach if you want to make it fuller.\"  She beams: \"That'll be $8.39 please!\"  Twenty minutes later, I'm enjoying a Santorini crÃªpe loaded with the good stuff, as tasty as any I've had in the Bay Area.   Thank you, Hazelnut CrÃªperie! Thank you, Charlotte, North Carolina!"}
{"text":"Just follow the smell of butter.  And don't let the name lead you to believe this is a dessert-only joint. Savory crepes play a starring role, too, which is what led a friend and me here for lunch.   The small, clean, white/natural space is set up for counter service, with a couple four-tops inside and several smaller two-tops just outside the creperie. An assortment of bottled and canned non-alcoholic drinks are on display next to the counter. Eat-in or to-go, you'll take a number and enjoy a relatively short wait (~five minutes) before the goodness arrives.  I had the Southwest veggie, which was like a rice-less burrito in terms of fillings. Black beans, tomato, fresh avocado (not the processed mush, thank you kindly), cheddar and the right amount of sour cream. Fluffy with just a little crisp around the edges, my crepe was a tasty and filling bite.   There are more than a half-dozen carnivore-friendly selections, as well as the option to add meat to a veggie crepe. Breakfast is on the menu, whether you crave a signature or custom crepe, and should you desire an afternoon sugar coma you've come to the right place. They had me at Nutella...  I'll be back to indulge in a dessert crepe and hope business one day allows Saturday morning hours--weekends are for breaking the weekday cereal routine, and some days my motivation goes only far as Bisquick."}
{"text":"Nestled by the side, this place is worth a try, especially for their chicken curry crepes. Loved it!!"}
{"text":"Lean, elegant and tasty food. It has a little bit of everything; breakfast, lunch and sweets. The crepes are made to perfection and the price is reasonable. The size of the crepes is just right too. I had the maple dream and my boyfriend had the Americana for breakfast, I would recommend both to anyone."}
{"text":"This was a perfectly sweet breakfast. I hadn't realized that it was not really a sit down restaurant but more of a fast food place. I went with the child in my heart and got the Banana Berry Cinn Crepe because who could turn down dessert for breakfast. The cinnamon was an unexpected twist that i really enjoyed. My dad got the the Mariachi Crepe which had avocado and Jalapeno cream. I got to try some and it was very good. I will say that that is a good easy breakfast but it won't necessarily keep you full for hours."}
{"text":"(Thanks Google Translate---Translation below, lol!)   Oh combien je aime les crÃªpes! Dimanche matin nÃ©cessite un dÃ©licieux brunch alors quand je eu la possibilitÃ© de choisir, je voulais crÃªpes! Lors d'un rÃ©cent voyage Ã  7th Street marchÃ© public, mes yeux pÃ©tillaient quand je voyais les noisettes CrÃªperie et je savais que je serais de retour. Donc, nous sommes ici. HC a crÃªpes salÃ©es et sucrÃ©es alors nous avons optÃ© pour la sarriette. Je eu la suisse et Delis et hubs eu la Veggie Chipotle au tofu. Nous avons pris une promenade autour du marchÃ© tandis que nos crÃªpes ont Ã©tÃ© prÃ©parÃ©es et quand ils Ã©taient prÃªts, ils ont Ã©tÃ© amenÃ©s Ã  nous et nous sommes arrivÃ©s aux affaires. Les deux incroyablement dÃ©licieux! Il Ã©tait presque comme si nous avions une course pour voir qui serait le terminer premier, mais il Ã©tait juste que bon. Dans l'ensemble, ce fut la faÃ§on parfaite de commencer notre dimanche! Nous allons certainement revenir Ã  vÃ©rifier certaines des autres crÃªpes.  Oh how I love crepes! Sunday morning requires a delicious brunch so when I had the opportunity to choose, I wanted crepes! During a recent trip to 7th Street public market, my eyes twinkled when I saw Hazelnuts Creperie and I knew that I would be back. So, here we are. HC has savory and sweet crepes so we opted for savory. I had the Swiss and Delis and hubs had the Chipotle Veggie with Tofu. We took a stroll around the market while our crepes were being prepared and when they were ready, they were brought out to us and we got down to business. Both amazingly delicious! It was almost like we had a race to see who would finish it first, but it was just that good. Overall, this was the perfect way to start our Sunday! We'll surely be back to check out some of the other crepes.  *Make sure to bring your parking ticket to get validated*"}
{"text":"Stopped by here a few weeks ago and got the southwest vegetarian crepe. It was amazing. I thoroughly enjoyed it and it was surprisingly filling. I'm looking forward to coming back on a Saturday and having breakfast with my family."}
{"text":"This breakfast stand is situated right by the doors so it's easy access. Tables right close by but the coldy cold can come in those same doors so chose your seats carefully. Crepes come sweet, savory, or breakfast. Not sure how they draw the lines because after having the candy coated sugar bomb they call Maple Dream the banana split looks almost healthy.  Got a food-pager and went in search of coffee, thing started ringing on the way back so my lovely bride hunted up a table while I gathered up the grub. Eggs, cheddar cheeses, bacons, maple syrups, powdered sugar, and butter. Mapling the Dream! A had Chevre & Mozz, I don't even know what that means..."}
{"text":"Well delicious indeed I had the Maple Dream which was done beautifully..."}
{"text":"Not sure if I have ever had a crepe before trying Hazelnuts. However, boyfriend and I end up at 7th St. Market for brunch/breakfast often and I wanted to try something new. I loved the buffalo chicken crepe and would definitely get again!"}
{"text":"Stayed at Hilton. Had breakfast here, strawberry and cream. It was very good. A lot of fruits. The pancake was crispy and fluff at the same time. Remind me of Sophie's Crepes at San Francisco."}
{"text":"Chill spot, nice people working, just plain really good food. Approx 6 tables. Dessert, breakfast, or lunch, ask the crepes are awesome!"}
{"text":"I brought my wife and daughter here for Mother's Day.  As soon as we walked in, a complete stranger came up to me and said, \"This place is good!\".  Trust me, she was 100% correct.  My daughter and I had the Chipotle Chicken crepe.  We both agreed that it was one of the best meals we've ever eaten.  My daughter's a 15-year-old teenager, and they aren't easily impressed.  We are fans for life."}
{"text":"I had the Nutella and strawberries crepe. Really good choice on a sundae morning to go with my Not Just Coffee latte. I would eat here again, $7 and a reasonable size. There's a ton of sweet and savory options but there's only one in my heart: Nutella."}
{"text":"Can I just say that this place has the best Crepes I have ever had in my life.   The service was very quick and the staff was so friendly. They made sure to ask us how we liked it before we left. My whole group loved their crepes. Now, I feel like any Crepe I eat cannot compare.   I had a vergetarian crepe and it was amazing. I have never had a savory crepe before and I was so pleasantly surprised at how amazing it was. The kitchen area seems very well kept and clean which is always a plus. If you live in Charlotte, this is a must-try restaurant. My family loved the nutella with stawbetty and banana the best.   I suggest getting coffee from the stand nearby!"}
{"text":"There is nothing bad I can say about this creperie. If you love crepes, in fact, even if you don't, you will LOVE this place. The staff are so kind and sweet. They don't rush you to make an order. They will even help you make a decision (there are many choices).   I suggest getting coffee with your crepe from the coffee stand next to the creperie stand. I got the veggie savory crepe with is fantastic. I would highly recommend the nutella with strawberry and banana crepe.   The best part about this location is that you can take the metro rail right to its front door! Very convenient for a morning run uptown. The atmosphere is very hipster inside the market and you can find some great items for different dietary restrictions."}
{"text":"I rarely get to go here since they close at 3pm. So the weekends are my only option. But one day, my brother was the only person to take me to places and when I asked him if I could go he was like, \"eeeeeehhhh i don't like crepes.\" and i was like what? W H A T ??? b/c there were like different kinds of things put inside of the crepes how could he not like crepes i don't understand. i already tried the strawberry and whipped cream, and that taste got me hooked and now every weekend i yearn to go here because i need that fix. bruh. i need the fix. brrruuhhh."}
{"text":"Great options for both savory and sweet crepes. My friend and I got one of each and split both. Sooooo yummy. We got the Catalina and the Creme de la Crepe. I recommend both."}
{"text":"Came in with 12 people on a Sunday morning. Very quick and nice ladies there. Had the Americana and a bite of my teammates maple dream. Very good and fast food."}
{"text":"Curry Chicken Crepe!!  As other reviewers have said you can order mild or spicy.  Me, I'm naturally spicy, so it made the choice an easy one.   I will be back with the intention of ordering a different choice, but I'll be hard pressed to not order the curry again."}
{"text":"A very solid breakfast/lunch option, especially if you're looking to try a crepe in Charlotte. I ordered the Southwestern veggie, which has cheddar, black beans, tomatoes, red onion, garlic chilies, avocado, and sour cream (I left off sour cream). The crepe was thin and crispy but still held up well under the toppings. This crepe didn't have a ton of fillings but it was loaded with cheese which was good because who doesn't love cheese? I wish they would cook the fillings separately, however, because the cheese was melted enough but the avocado and black beans were pretty firm and would've been better if they'd been cooked just a little before being placed on the crepe. The tomatoes and red onion added good flavor, and the garlic chilies added a nice kick and flavor for a few bites but were missed for the most part.  My crepe came out in 6-7 minutes just before the lunch rush wave, which seemed pretty quick to me. For $8-9 for a crepe that isn't super filling, it's not the best deal, but the ingredients seemed very fresh and high quality so it's certainly not a ripoff either."}
{"text":"Delicious.  We had Smores, one with goat cheese/strawberries/walnuts, and one with Nutella/bananas.  Uniformly amazing and a perfect post-Thanksgiving brunch."}
{"text":"This place gives me the crÃªpes...in a good way! I honestly didn't think it was going to be as good as it was but boy did that chunkster crÃªpe exceed my expectations! Went to Amelie's initially only to find out they only serve crÃªpes in the Spring time. Super weird! So the wife and I went here instead. Staff was friendly and very informative as well. Most definitely will be back the next time we're in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"The curry crepe was slap your mama good! Perfect combo of flavors and a very unique dish. They have set them apart from the crepe scene!"}
{"text":"We saw this place on yelp while we were downtown and starving.  I decided to search yelp for  best rating and this place popped right up.  Food is good. But this is more of an in-out place, like almost a food court set up; except it's in an office building.  I would have liked it better if the beverages inside of the ice box were cold, otherwise, it was just okay to me.  I had the Maple Syrup and my husband had the Curry Chicken crepe.  I wasn't overly satisfied like some of the other reviews, but check it out for yourself."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Great ingredients and great food! Only complaint is that the wait time for your food can be awhile. Other than that, best crepes hands down! They just opened a new location in the Public Market so check that location out too! Hope they keep growing, because I would love to have one up in Birkdale!"}
{"text":"I needed a place to eat breakfast near my hotel, and ran across this place. I was upset that my hotel doesn't offer breakfast, but these crepes made everything better. I highly recommend the breakfast Americana."}
{"text":"Food...Fantastic! You must try the Curry Chicken Crepe!~! Service...Friendly and personable! My only criticism would be the atmosphere... the seating is placed within a foyer of a corporate building. Too bad they didn't have more space to work with."}
{"text":"Food...Fantastic! You must try the Curry Chicken Crepe!~! Service...Friendly and personable!"}
{"text":"Outstanding crepes with fresh fillings and ingredients.  The Nutella crepes taste as good as any I had in France, very well done!  The coffee was also excellent and I appreciated several vegetarian options"}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast and lunch!  Highly recommend their Curry Chicken Crepe! Curry sauce, chicken, and veggies/cheese come together like a melody.   For vegetarians, try their Very Veggie Curry Crepe! It's like the veggie equivalent for their signature Curry Chicken crepe without the chicken."}
{"text":"Not anywhere as good as the uptown locations which I love. Service was SLOW and food was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Good menu, friendly staff, clean.  This crepery is tucked into the bottom floor of an uptown commercial building with a cadre of regulars.  As a result, I think the ratings are inflated.  Having eaten at a few other creperies around the country, this one hits around average.  Aside from the sweet and a savory varieties, it still lacks originality and freshness.  A \"Charlotte\" variety would kick it up a notch.  Though, aside from banking, I struggle to define what a 'Charlotte flavor' would be.  Also,  drinks are catered by minute maid and the Coca-Cola...nothing specialist this end.  On a plus, the staff offered to refills coffee, maintained a positive atmosphere and knows there regulars."}
{"text":"The interior is nothing to get excited about (sort of feels like you're eating in a hotel or office building lobby). Plus, the staff were very cranky on the day we went in and they were not busy at all, so, not sure what that was about (generally unfriendly, lackluster).  However, the food is really quite good - fresh ingredients, good ingredient options (some crepe places are quite boring, I've noticed), and all made quickly and at a fair price. Hazelnuts provides a nice opportunity to grab a good quality breakfast and go eat it outside in one of the fantastic nearby parks for an excellent view of the city."}
{"text":"Love this little gem of a place - and it's clearly a favorite for our little guy! Thanks for keeping it real and fresh -- we are huge fans!!!"}
{"text":"Visited the 7th Street Market today and ordered 2 crepes and received a buzzer for notification when my order was complete. I waited over 30 minutes then approached the cashier again for a status. All 4 employees did not recognize my order. After showing the buzzer they provided they reviewed the receipts and acknowledged my order and stated they would \"do it fast\" without an apology.  After waiting another 15 mins we received our food with an additional sweet crepe. While the food is excellent, the service needs immediate attention."}
{"text":"I've been to Hazelnuts Creperie for both breakfast and lunch, and they are a solid four star establishment. They are located in an office building next to McCormick & Schmick's.  This is a simple place, with two large tables inside their space, and a few more two- and four-seaters in the building.  The food is surprisingly good and it's worth giving them a try.  I prefer them for breakfast, and my favorite is the make-your-own crepe with scrambled eggs, ham, cheddar, avocado, and chipotle aioli. They do scrambled eggs nicely by spreading the egg around the crepe so it bakes right in.  They are also generous with the fillings. The aioli is a really good call, as it adds both flavor and a little heat. If you add avocado, they give you half of one scooped fresh right out of the shell.  I LOVE this crepe.  When my hubby joined me on one visit, he tried the mariachi crepe, with scrambled eggs, cheddar, bacon, black beans, and red onions.  I liked everything but the sauce - it was too creamy and there was a little too much of it.   Their coffee is strong enough for our taste and is pretty good.  Refills are $1.  For lunch, I have tried the make your own crepe with avocado, spinach, black beans, cheddar, and jalapeÃ±o cream.  You don't even miss the meat with this one!  The jalapeÃ±o cream also adds great flavor without being too spicy.  I have yet to try their sweet crepes; I always have a craving for savory when I visit.  Eventually I will.  I really enjoy their food and plan to keep returning!"}
{"text":"Very posh. The food was excellent, the location very modern and artistically expressive. Quite an experience."}
{"text":"**UPDATE:  Restaurant will not be open during DNC**  Following my post about no coffee past Noon, the owner invited me back for a complimentary breakfast this morning.  I took him up on it, and enjoyed a flavorful chevre & mozzarella crepe *with* a smooth, bold locally-roasted coffee.    Unfortunately, the staff informed me, the creperie won't be open for other DNC travellers to try next week... because of the tight restrictions on traffic & parking in the area, the restaurant won't be able to get supplies in the morning.  Bummer, because it was worth the trip (twice).   ---------------------------------- Late flight into Charlotte for DNC... Placed crepe order + coffee @ 12:04 pm.  \"We're out of coffee\". Could you make more, I ask?  The answer was no.  Sorry, local business I specifically drove  to in order to support you... I had to go to Dean & Deluca across the street.   Note for Charlotte business owners: thousands of journalists & politicos are about to descend upon you.  If you want them to give you their $$, extend those coffee serving hours past Noon."}
{"text":"Honestly I don't want to write a review on this place because then everyone will rush and I'll have to wait in line.  However I won't be stingy. This is def a go to spot. Within public  market. You really can't go wrong with either choice of crepe. Sweet, savory. Eat one there and you'll order another to go"}
{"text":"Delicious! Good portions and really well made.  Had a Nutella and fruit crepe after a breakfast one. Overall awesome breakfast with nice people and a lovely atmosphere."}
{"text":"Wow. No other words to describe it. These crepes are delicious and a great excuse to have dessert for breakfast. I had the \"Not French Toast\" and my son had the S'mores. Both were phenomenal! Definitely worth the walk from our hotel. No question. Even in the heat. Just yum! The staff is unbelievably nice too... And helpful! Come check them out!"}
{"text":"Best crepes in Charlotte! We have had almost every savory crepe on the menu and have never been disappointed. They all have wonderful and distinct flavors. Staff is helpful and friendly. Our favorites are the curry chicken and the not your Thai. Definitely recommend this to others."}
{"text":"Try the breakfast crepes! They're out of this world! They're a bit pricey $9-10 but what can you expect it's in the middle of the city. The downside to this place is the parking situation. We had to pay $6 parking for less than an hour which is crazy but even then it was still worth it."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, I'm sorry that I don't get to it often enough.  There is not one thing that I didn't like.  The dessert crepes are marvelous!    The restaurant is cafeteria style and you order your food at the front register.  It is very quick and easy.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  I can't wait to try this spot again, hopefully soon.  Parking can be tricky!"}
{"text":"The BEST crepes I have had in a very long time!!! On the recommendation from my brother, we hit the 7th Market. I never pass on an opportunity to get a crepe and we ordered the buffalo chicken and the BLT. The crepes were PERFECT. We were busy visit in with a friend and ate them cold after they left and they were still outstanding. They were light and the edges had a beautiful crispness. We will be back the next time we are in Charlotte."}
{"text":"The creperie is in the lobby of a business building but the food is worth the trip in. The food was amazing. My party got the catalina, the Buffalo chicken, pig and Swiss, and the southwest veggie, and everyone was extremely satisfied. Although the service was not exactly friendly, the second time we visited (same day, this time for dessert) the staff was much friendlier. The dessert crepes were absolutely divine and more than represented how good the food there was."}
{"text":"Went to Hazelnut Creperie with some coworkers for lunch. Ordered the Basil Pesto Chicken savory crepe. Never had a savory crepe so it was a new experience. Very flavorful and filling! A little pricey - about $9 after tax.   Not sure if savory crepes are for me but I will definitely be back for a sweet crepe!"}
{"text":"I love there crepes! They do it quickly and it's soooo delicious. I recommend the maple dream of you want something sweet and they chipotle chicken if you want something hearty ."}
{"text":"Where have you been all my life???? I walked past this place for years and never knew what I was missing. I always get the Creme de la Crepe or the chicken basil pesto crepe. Both are delicious. They use fresh ingredients. Additionally, the staff works well to make the ordering process efficient. You can tell they have a very good team here. There is enough seating for a couple, but isn't the best place to bring a group as it's a smaller venue."}
{"text":"Awesome crepes. Great choices even if you are vegetarian. Not just sweet one, you can get savory crepes too. Awesome and smiling service. Check it out. Great place to start your day."}
{"text":"Just come back from a delightful brunch. The crepes were excellent... enjoyed every bite.. We certainly recommend this restaurant!!!!"}
{"text":"YUMMY! I don't know which crepe I got but something along the lines of .. turkey, tomato, mozzarella, avocado It was delicious and I ate very single bite! Didn't feel too heavy and was a great breakfast."}
{"text":"They take a while to make so expect to wait 20 minutes for the food after you ordered. Service is decent. Crepes are pretty good, but I think they're expensive. All in all nice place to stop for breakfast!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in uptown Charlotte with crepes that are spectacular. It's set back in the lobby of 200 S. Tryon Street and there, they make home made crepes for breakfast and lunch. The curry chicken crepe is my personal favorite, full of flavor and spice. Usually I go with a friend and we get two different crepes and share them so we can try the rest of the menu out. They have breakfast crepes, lunch crepes, savory and sweet. It's all made to order, so they can be tweaked to your taste. They do like to keep things spicy, so keep that in mind.  There is limited seating. Definitely try this place."}
{"text":"Only come here if you want to watch the unsanitary crepe maker make your food!  I came here because I was doing a class at UNCC across the street.  We have a creperie in my hometown, so I figured this would be something familiar.  My face was turned up in knots as I watched the cook pick up topping and wipe her gloved hand on her pants each time she did. And not only once--we're talking about multiple times here!  Her pants were very heavily stained from the times she's done it before throughout the day. Not to mention not even trying to change gloves between the times of touching the order machine and the food.  It was nauseating!  The cook saw my turned up face and said \"What's wrong?\"  I couldn't even say because I didn't want her to do anything else to my food and I had already paid $9 bucks for it. I will never eat here again.  You can bet on that."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, especially with all the great reviews.... But the service left something (a lot) to be desired.  This is not a big restaurant, at all. So to walk in and not have a single staff either acknowledge you or  direct you to where to order, sets the tone.  As it was our first time, we asked for recommendations, not sure why that was so difficult. The staff had no recommendations, just the blanket, \"everything is good\" response. That answer always makes me worried, how to you work somewhere and have no opinion?   We settled on the Americana and the samosa. The samosa was tasty, the Americana had processed turkey meat (like the rounds from the plastic packages at Walmart.) Not what you would expect for $9....I mean at least go to the deli and get shaved turkey meat.  The food was good, the service was not. Overall, an unsatisfactory experience.   I do not recommend this pace and I would not go back."}
{"text":"First, I thought a crepe may not be filling enough for lunch - I was wrong.  The portion sizes are great!  The curry crepe is delicious. I initially thought the curry would be too strong for work, however the mix of curry and mango chutney is absolutely divine.  I have so many more options that I will try. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Nice walk from our hotel. It was exactly what we were expecting. The crepes were on point and we ate every bite."}
{"text":"Delicious! The location of this place is great. Lazy morning and I can have postmates deliver my order to my apartment near RB park. The strawberry and nutella is my favorite, as it is at other places. I recommend asking to skip the whipped cream if you get it to go (or delivered) as it will melt and make the crepe a little bit soggy. Really wish I could learn to make these at home, but I'll count on hazelnuts in the interim."}
{"text":"This place is great! I took my family out saturday morning and we stopped by for some crepes they were amazing we each ordered something different and they were all delish not one crepe was left.   This place is kinda tucked away in the lobby of an office building but the atmosphere is cozy! The service was top notch and my famiky and I had a wonderful experience!  I will definatly be back!"}
{"text":"I don't generally like crepes. I never saw the point I guess. As much as I like food that seems odd, even to me!  But these crepes!!!  They were so tasty. We had the breakfast ones with eggs, bacon, and maple syrup. Decadent. Delicious. I like crepes. At least these crepes!"}
{"text":"Awesome crepes! Hazelnut and  the French toast ones (I have a sweet tooth ) can't be beat.  Good stuff. I promise"}
{"text":"The service was great, but my chicken curry crepe was really, really gross. I like curry, but this was weird. It was a cream based sauce, loaded with yellow curry powder. The sad thing is that it was recommended to me by the staff member.   Should have gone with a sweet crepe, as I think I just ordered poorly."}
{"text":"I really liked the concept, it's a Chipotle-like crepe fast service place. There was very little seating. There are menu options or you can build your own. The crepes themselves were not fantastic, they definitely have the taste of being put together hastily from pre-made crepes and bland fillings. I did like the lemon-y crepe though. It also took a long time to get our orders.  Overall, it's not bad and I wouldn't mind coming back, but I would not seek it out."}
{"text":"We've been 3 times now and has been excellent every time. We've had the S'mores and the Banana Split. Both were incredible but the S'mores was just simply awesome. Hey have a wide variety to choose from including savory food crepes. But we love the dessert ones.  They are big enough to split and at $10, makes sense to do as well.   We will be going back often. Service all 3 times has been great."}
{"text":"Another great Yelp find.   My husband says, \"I just kind of want to live here and eat creps.\"  Super delicious.   We got the Americana and the Meriachi.   Both had amazing flavors.   We shared the S'mores a la mode to taste a sweet one.  It was heavenly.   We thoroughly enjoyed this place."}
{"text":"Woo! Another Crepe place off the list.   I've really yet to find a \"bad\" crepe, but these guys definitely reinforced what a good crepe should be. Nice, easy Sunday morning breakfast/brunch at 7th street market. I got the Chevre & Mozz and the lady got Berry Delight. Both were excellent. They did a fantastic job of filling the crepe to get your money's worth, and the quality of ingredients plus inventive flavor combinations definitely makes this place 5 star worthy. I don't have any complaints. Thanks for a great breakfast, Hazelnuts! We'll see you again soon."}
{"text":"I had bookmarked this place based on Yelp reviews and tried to think of a time where I could be uptown before 3, when they close and not have to think about or worry where to park.  Luckily, one of my friends came into town this past weekend and we were up at the ass crack of dawn and hungry for breakfast.  I pulled out my Yelp bookmarks and we aimed for Hazelnuts Creperie and boy they did not disappoint!  We ordered the Vegetarian Southwest Crepe and the Banana Berry Cinn Crepe, cut them in half and both enjoyed the best of both worlds (sweet and savory, that is)!  Crepes are priced just under $10 and portion size is decent and is very hearty and filling.  Staff is friendly. Free cups of water. No wi-fi. Great lounge areas in window and on side, and nice tables by the counter where you place your order and pay.  Grab a seat while it's being made and they'll call you when it's ready.  Cool bunch of customers that come in, lots of earthy looking clientele and a couple of business types who stay at nearby hotels.  Parking is hassle free and literally free on the weekends, so it's a win-win.. don't have to worry about getting towed or finding a space and can fill your belly at the same time!!!  SCORE!  I will definitely come back another weekend!"}
{"text":"Goodness, could there be anything more delicious...I could not decide what I wanted more to start with dessert just in case I got full or have a normal meal progression. In the end I started with dessert which was fantabulous!! The Nutella Banana!!! This is a light melt in your mouth crepe."}
{"text":"After smelling the crepes here for three weeks as I walked to my office, I finally gave Hazlenuts a try today for lunch. Delicious! I had the savory crepes with chicken, basil pesto, red onions, goat cheese. The filling was flowing out of it as I cut the first piece. Loved the crunchy edges. My favorite lunch so far uptown! Will be back many times again, I'm sure. Next time for the Nutella crepes!"}
{"text":"i enjoyed it. great for a quick bite in the morning. It was  alittle warm inside for me but the food made up for it."}
{"text":"Wow! This was a yummy surprise! I tried the savory chicken pesto crepe. It was perfectly loaded with delicious goat cheese, finely diced red onion, fresh red tomatoes, chicken, pesto sauce and I can't remember the green component (I was too busy discreetly scarfing it down)!?! The crepe was not too thin and not too thick, literally just right with a slight crisp texture. The crispness was excellent, it defied any possible sogginess from the juicy interior of scrumptious ingredients.  You order at the counter, service was very friendly and mannerly. This was a super satisfying lunch and I  look forward to trying more of the savory crepes as well as the sweet crepes."}
{"text":"The Santorini crepe is very tasty, perfect for breakfast or brunch! The location is convenient and enjoyable as well. It seems to be a lobby or something but it's nice siting area and quiet in the morning."}
{"text":"We stopped her on part of a food de Tour and its was ok. We had bananas and nutella and it was very tasty.  I would try this place again for sure"}
{"text":"SOOOO good! I will go back every time I'm in Charlotte. I have only had the one with Eggs, cheese, bacon, and maple syrup - but it's too good to try any others!"}
{"text":"The crepe's were awesome today.  Our group had 9 different crepes and a salad.  Everything was great.  The curry crepe's were the best.  Don't forget the dessert crepes."}
{"text":"I got the maple dream breakfast crepe and it was on point! Props to the girl who made my crepe today! She was efficient, friendly, and you can tell she was a hard worker"}
{"text":"Wow, what a pleasant surprise for breakfast before we left town. My husband found this here on Yelp, so from the description we knew it would be tucked away uptown. As it turns out, there is a sandwich board outside directing you in so it's not that difficult to find.   Whether you want breakfast, lunch, or an afternoon snack, they have a variety of crepes to suit just about everyone. My husband had the Maple Dream, and I tried the Americana. Both were big, but the Americana is stuffed with more ingredients that all blend together so well - with the chipotle aioli adding such a great flavor. No need for side items unless you have a huge appetite. The crepe will cover it!  We live in downtown Greenville, SC and an establishment such as this would do well here, especially if it stayed open later for the dessert crowd."}
{"text":"Delicious crepes with the bonus of fantastic service. We came on a very busy Sunday morning and the staff smiled the whole time. I got the chunkster but added Nutella, it was heavenly!"}
{"text":"Yum!!! Found this place on a weekend visit to Charlotte with the help of Yelp. It did seem to be totally hidden away, you have to be looking for it and I was glad we sought it out. It was a tough decision but I went for a savory crepe, stuffed with chicken and avocado, I was one happy camper. I so wanted to try one of the dessert crepes but the generous portion of my savory one left me stuffed. I recommend going with a friend and splitting one of each!"}
{"text":"I say \"let them eat Crepes\"! I don't understand when others don't - what's not to love? At Hazelnuts you can choose between sweet or savory or shoot just go for both but you better be hungry! My favorite crepes to get here is the Basil Chicken Pesto minus the tomatoes and/or the Nutella Banana - Yum!   This is my favorite restaurant to go to at 7th Street public Market because 1) food has always been consistently good, 2) if and when their is a line, it moves pretty fast and 3) they give you a buzzer so you know when your food is done instead of having someone track you down in the maze of tables.   My only hesitation for giving a five is I feel they could go above and beyond with having various options of toppings to drizzle over the crepe like a pesto or balsamic drizzle.   The other best part about this location is that it's neighbor is Tank's Tap so I can have my crepe and have my beer too!"}
{"text":"I loved it !  The food gets five stars, but overall I think four. The setup inside the lobby was not my favorite; I felt like I was in an airport or a cafeteria.  The food made up for it though!! My boyfriend and I were passing through town, so we had never heard of it.  I read some Yelp reviews and we decided to go.    We each tried a savory crepe ( I can't remember which ones now), and they were both delicious. Then we split the nutella, banana, and strawberry crepe. Really tasty.  The one thing that I was disappointed with was that they did not have nutella and coconut, or the simple lemon sugar crepe.  Otherwise, the selection was pretty good.  If you are wondering if you should go, you definitely SHOULD! :)"}
{"text":"Came here by chance..It was nothing to really brag about..can't say that I'm in a rush to return or if I ever will. I found the crepes to be just okay and overpriced.  What's sad it I can't even remember what type of crepe, I ordered. I do know that it had olives and spinach in it..no meat."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Customer service is wonderful and welcoming. Would a great spot for a quick dinner or a delicious treat. I enjoyed the Basil pesto chicken while shopping, but they offer many fruit filled selections as well! Do yourself a favor & stop by when you are in the area, you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Went for a late breakfast and we had the santorini, Greek style, and the ham and Swiss.  Both were very flavorful and had a nice variety of ingredients.  The crepes were really big but the only drawback to the food was the amount of stuff inside the crepes.  Not as much as I would have liked.  The only other drawback was the seating was kind of in the lobby of the building, might be bad during high traffic hours.  Overall I liked the place, the staff was nice and we'd go back again."}
{"text":"I stopped in to Hazelnuts Creperie on recommendation of pretty much all of my coworkers who have stayed in Charlotte. I tried the curry chicken crepe with the spicy chili sauce on the side. It was a great mix of savory and sweet flavors. I came in at 10am on a weekday so I was the only one there and got my food in five minutes. Staff were friendly and I appreciated that they use compostable paper to-go containers. Great choice for breakfast/lunch downtown!"}
{"text":"Quick and delicious! Off the beaten path but worth it in an over charged for dinner city! Well worth it!"}
{"text":"Very tasty and not pretentious at all, this creperie is located in the lobby area of the office tower. Great selection of crepes including the savories and the sweets and so my wife chose one of the latter while I had one of the former.  Very well stuffed, my \"Americana\" was a bit breakfasty with egg, cheddar, avocado, spinach and tomato. I slathered some Sriracha on top as well. Yum and I was full!  My wife had the Nutella and banana and it had the usual nutella and banana in side. Not too sweet at all, with a very light dusting of powdered sugar on top.  A cooler with sodas and juices is available. I had a coffee that was not so great (but then, I was at Not Just Coffee a few minutes before so my taste buds had a high expectation).  Nice place for an inexpensive breakfast if you're in the area. Parking? Uh... good luck."}
{"text":"The crepes are really, really good! I tried the Nutella and banana combo and it was delicious. The crepes are pretty large, and could be shared. I thought they had a nice menu of both savory and sweet crepes.   The service was friendly and fast. I felt the prices were reasonable $5-8 for a crepe. And I actually liked the location,  it was a great set-up if you have little ones.   We will be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome crepes both savory and sweet, great new spot in Blakeney Shopping center!"}
{"text":"The new location in 7th street market is excellent.  Fresh and done right.  Best crepe I've ever had.   Enjoyed the curry chicken crepe."}
{"text":"Love this place.   Even if they are busy the turnaround time is great and their product always taste fresh.   I usually get the Mariachi crepe.  Had several others and they are all good"}
{"text":"Delicious crepes tucked inside a business building in downtown Charlotte. In downtown areas dominated with Starbucks at every corner, this little gem for breakfast is truly refreshing. For Nutella lovers, you can of course get your fix here!"}
{"text":"Yes to this place!  They have a large menu of savory and sweet crepes. It's very popular during the week for lunch with all the office workers. Get there early if you can!  Note that this place is not visible from the road, it's tucked into the building lobby so it's hidden a bit. Look for the sandwich board sign they place in front of the building.    You order and pay at the front. Takes a little time as they make your crepe fresh of course. They recently implemented a pager system instead of yelling out your name. Bravo!  The seating is a little less than satisfying as there are a few tables in the building lobby here.   Honestly go for the food, it's delic"}
{"text":"We came here for dessert yesterday, it was so satisfying! Got the nutella banana crepe with ice cream. The crepe was cripsy and thin while the filling was plentiful. It was a great midday treat.   I am definitely coming back for that nutella smores crepe. It got a little pricey so I suggest sticking to something basic on the menu to add on to or get a crepe from the menu."}
{"text":"Best crepes I have ever had. Frequent about 3 times a week. Staff is always friendly as well"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and perfect crepes. Perfect thinness and the edges are a little crispy. Made myself a custom crepe for breakfast and devoured it pretty quickly!"}
{"text":"Second time caller.  If you love breakfast, which I don't, this place covers both.  I wish I lived here, because I would eat here everyday!  Start with the Americana and work your way through the menu, or don't, because I can't get past how good it is.   Only knock on this place is you have to walk to it since there is no parking around, but that's a good thing, order a sweet crepe, pretend it's not desert for breakfast and walk it off."}
{"text":"Hidden place, but the breakfast crepe was great.  Also enjoyed a Sweet Crepe with Nutella, graham crackers, powdered sugar, honey, and ice cream....I definitely recommend it and it is not too heavy.  The cafe smells great and the staff is extremely friendly and helpful as well."}
{"text":"YAAAASS!!  This place is quick, simple and unbelievably yummy!! They have tons of different kinds of Crepes - from breakfast to lunch to dessert styles. They have a few tables in the area but the rest are outside the doors and spill over into the hotel making it roomy and comfortable. Great spot for a quick brunch!"}
{"text":"Crepes were great. Although, the lady who was working the register was very rude when I asked if meat could be excluded from a specific crepe. She made an annoyed face at me and was rude for the rest of the transaction. Great food! Not so great service."}
{"text":"Really good crepes and they are big! Fast service. Only thing that was strange was that it's in a hotel lobby. Also good to note that it's kind of like a little cafe as opposed to a sit down restaurant with a waiter. You just order up front and take a seat, nothing super fancy. They are a bit expensive (around $9 each) but I guess since they are good sized crepes it's worth it. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great place for a quick delicious breakfast! Fast, friendly service.  My husband and I stopped here for breakfast on a Saturday morning. I had the Americana crepe which was super good and my husband thoroughly enjoyed the mariachi crepe. I would definitely come here again. We were both very happy with our food.  The ambiance was interesting. The restaurant is very small. You order at the counter and they prepare your crepe and call your name to pick it up. There is plenty of seating in the lobby area outside the restaurant, but very limited seating inside. Everything was served on paper plates."}
{"text":"We really enjoy Hazelnuts !  We have had so many of their crepes and never been disapponted.  Love that they are open every day unlike most others in downtown clt.   Thanks, Hazelnuts, for our go-to weekend lunch place!"}
{"text":"It's about time I update my 2 year old review!  Pretty much giving this place 5 stars due to the fact that I come here at least once (if not twice) a week to get a breakfast crepe.  I am so fortunate to work across the street from their Tryon location, but the great news is that in the two years between my reviews, they've opened up a 2nd location in the 7th Street Public Market.  I'm not sure which location sees more people, but the more locations, the better when you are talking about Hazelnuts.  The staff always warmly greets me by my first name in the mornings and I have a \"regular\" order now.  It may be pretty quiet in the mornings here, but the staff are on their toes prepping for a big lunch service.  I've never been here for lunch, but the way they are prepping during breakfast time, there must be a large crowd.  My \"go-to\" regular order in the mornings is a Mariachi with no onions and it hits the spot every morning.  Probably my second favorite order for breakfast is the Maple Dream.  You can't really go wrong with anything from the menu... or create your own!  So I used to think that being located in the building lobby would be a disadvantage.  But since the restaurant space itself only has two 4 person tables within it makes sense for the tables to over flow into the lobby area.  The tables that can be pushed together for large groups.  My favorite thing to do during breakfast is to eat my Mariachi and people watch the folks walking through the lobby."}
{"text":"My heart will always be at their Tryon (first) location, but I'm glad Hazelnuts is in the Public Market.  It's the perfect venue for the format of crepes... have/split a snack, eat breakfast or lunch..... either way, just know it will be delicious and awesome.  Since my office moved my train stop is 7th street station so it is dangerous since I can just hop off the train and grab a crepe before I head into the office.  The morning crowd is usually VERY relaxed, nothing too hectic.  Most of the other vendors in the market are prepping for lunch... the only other guys serving are Not Just Coffee and Local Loaf.  Same, great crepes on the menu.... and the staff is super nice... even if I'm up at the counter looking like a hungry puppy dog right at 8am when they open.  The pager system is a little more sophisticated here, probably just for the range since the market sprawls a little more than their original location.  Same disposable plates and plastic silverware here and just make sure to tell them if you want your order \"to go\" or for \"here\".  My \"go-to\" is the Mariachi (no onions please).  I tend to lean to the savory crepes rather than the dessert crepes.  To each their own!  You can even customize your crepe too.  Everything is fresh and delicious.  My favorite part of the crepe is the in-between the edges and the middle where it's not quite crispy, but not quite the center. So good!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Just amazing. It was so good, after the Buffalo chicken  crepe, we went back for a S'Mores a la mode!!!"}
{"text":"Open 7 days a week. Friendly service with yummy treats ranging from sweet to savory."}
{"text":"Excellent little nook located just inside the building lobby. This is a great place to grab a quick & delicious bite. Ayonna & Tashia (I really hope I spelled their names correctly) were amazingly pleasant & accommodating. Usually I like a sweet crepe but today I was in the mood for something savory so I opted for The Santorini (86 the olives, add chicken, sub egg whites) because that's how I roll. Ayonna aimed to please and made the perfect version just for me. Needless to say I devoured Santorini, wishing I could go back for seconds.   The setup is similar to Subway...you can view all the toppings opposite side of the glass as the crepe is being built. There are plenty of beverages and chips should you desire. Hazelnuts is a staple when in Charlotte. The bookmark stays in place.  ~Christy"}
{"text":"My daughters & I came here for a late breakfast because it is a quick walk from the Marriott.  Hands down the best crepes we've ever had!  Quality ingredients and great service. They were patient with my high maintenance 13 year old when she ordered off the menu.  We will be back tomorrow:-)"}
{"text":"What an amazing spot to get breakfast! Or lunch! Or dinner! Or dessert!  Hazelnuts has an amazing variety of crepes for every occasion while still keeping it classy - theres no 8 page menu here to try and please everyone.  I was visiting the area for a long weekend and heard about this place. Its central to lots of different modes of transportation and has ample parking within walking distance. Its located inside a building, but they have signs which make it easy to find!  I got a banana and nutella crepe the first day, and the second day I went back and got another! It was super filling, but it was nice and light at the same time. I didn't feel bogged down at all, and was definitely not hungry after for some time.  They offer a good amount of seating as well. The service was fast and pretty friendly. If you don't go here and you have the option to, you're messing up! Go snag yourself a treat or a meal, and do big things!   Highly reccomend!"}
{"text":"So glad to have given this a try.  Wonderful selection of sweet and savory crepes.  Breakfast crepes served all day.  There are also a good vegetarian crepes and salads.  I had the Pesto Capri which was packed with fresh veggies and the crepe texture was perfect.  My daughter had The Catalina which tasted amazing and contained generous ingredients.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Note to out-of-towners (like us),:  if you're trying to find this place (or any place downtown by street number), pay attention to the South vs. North part of the street name!  We went the wrong way and landed on North Tryon.  You want South Tryon.  This fresh crepe goodness is in an office building next to McCormick & Schmicks.  We finally found it on a recent Monday morning, and had the place to ourselves.  It is a small counter-service place.  Order, pay, and the gal who made our crepes did bring them to us.  My Americana was giant!  Filled with turkey, scrambled egg, avocado, onion, tomato, spinach and chipotle aioli tied it all together nicely.  Way too big for me, and since we were traveling I sadly had to waste some of it.  But Husband had no problem wolfing down an entire Chevre & Mozz, which had scrambled egg, bacon, mushrooms, onion, olives, goat cheese & mozzarella.    Loved the variety on the menu of sweet & savory crepes, and the prices are very reasonable for the quality and quantity.  ($8.50 for mine and $8.25 for Husband's).  Oddly enough neither of us had cell phone signals in here, so if you have to dink around on your phone while eating, it could possibly be a problem."}
{"text":"Looking to change up my usual Uptown lunch pattern, I wandered into Hazelnuts a couple months ago and ordered a Smoked BLT crepe. Immediate love.   The crepe has Smoked Turkey, Mozzarella, Avocado, Bacon, Romaine, Tomato and Chipotle aioli. In some ways I was semi hesitant, thinking won't the lettuce be soggy?  Nope. Very delicious combo of ingredients.  I've since become addicted and now add red onions to the mix.   Evidence of the addiction happened just this week as I walked down Tryon St with one lunch destination in mind but never made it past Hazelnuts. I'm sure all the other crepes are yummy too but I may never find out!"}
{"text":"Amazing crepes! And reasonably priced. I got the maple dream after reading some good reviews for it and everyone was right, it's great. We didn't have to wait more than a few mins for our food."}
{"text":"The crepe was ok.  Nothing fancy about it.  It's inside a business building so probably not easy to find.  We had a breakfast kind with ham, chess, avocado in it.  Again, normal crepe, nothing spectacular."}
