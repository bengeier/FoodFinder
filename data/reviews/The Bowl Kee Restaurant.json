We tried the Chinese hot bowl rice - it was ok, not worth the wait nor price."}

- hits the spot every time..especially at 2am"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food and it's open late. 

Try the blackbean chicken and the hot and sour soup."}
{"text":"You gotta try their lemon chicken and anything in their wok department! Great taste (with or without MSG) either way the chef knows what's up!"}
{"text":"This is a true pot experience! Food is tasty, not too oily and portion is decent! Will sure come back to try more dishes!"}
{"text":"I can summarize this restaurant in a few sentences:

1. Expensive, no dishes under $12
2. Small Portion, for the price, portion size is very small
3. Cash only

I honestly don't know where all the good reviews come from.  We spent $50 for 3 dishes that are just average, totally overpriced POS restaurant."}
{"text":"Food price is high, around $18 for a dish which is usually $10-13 in other Chinese restaurants. Hot pot rice for 2 is $18, but it's size is for one person actually. There is another hot pot rice restaurant in the plaza which is half price."}
{"text":"It was alright place for a casual eat when I am in the neighborhood, but didn't warrant driving for a hour for this. Ordered two stone pot rice, both came out fine, except the sticky hard rice was really hard to scrap off
With a spoon. The taro chicken and duck cooked down very quickly before our rices arrived, therefore becoming a big gooey bowl."}
{"text":"Food is ok..nothing too crazy or get excited over. but this one lady waitress gave the most horrible service. Probably won't be back because of her attitude issues."}
{"text":"Hotpot rice is one of the few dishes in Chinese cuisine that I actually like. They don't make it at very many restaurants, and it's actually quite good here.

The restaurant has been here for years and although it is on the smaller side, they always seem to have a good flow to their tables. Depending on the evening you go, it may be busier at some points of the night.

Hotpot rice is definitely the highlight of this restaurant and a must get if you are going to come here. They have many different options, but my favourite is definitely the one with the Chinese bacon (lap yuk) as it has the rice a little bit drier. The chicken ones are fine as well, but generally wetter. The best thing about Bowl Kee though is that when the rice is almost done and stuck to the walls of the hotpot, you can have them add soup into the bowl to help get that last bit of rice! Absolutely the best!
As for the other dishes here, the chicken and sweet & sour pork aren't bad, but a lot of the dishes are pretty mediocre. They are more the accompaniment to the hotpot rice.

Service here is quite good, and the servers all move pretty quickly. The restaurant can get a little loud a times, but it kind of adds to that family vibe.

Definitely a must try for those who love hotpot rice, and for those who have never tried it before. If you do plan on coming with a larger group though, I recommend making a reservation."}
{"text":"Hong Kong Typhoon-shelter CRAB!  Nothing else needs to be said.

In old days when fishing was still the way of life, there were typhoon-shelters for fishing boats to wait out for safety.  Fishermen from nearby countries, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, came here too and while they waited what better to do than conjuring up yummy dishes with their catch from the sea.  Voil√†, a fusion style of cooking was born.  \"Typhoon-shelter cooking\" is characterized by strong flavours and spiciness, liberal use of garlic and hot pepper that are not common in other Hong Kong dishes.  

Bow Kee manages to find very large crabs (def more than 2 lbs) for this dish.  The crab is flash-fried, and then covered by a topping that consists of fried garlic-chili-minced meat pieces and crispy fried anchovy.  The aroma is intoxicating as your waiter carries the dish towards you; all manners out the door and your hands go right in.  

Any leftover toppings?  Pack it in a doggy bag and it's great with congee or noodles the next day.

This restaurant is known for \"rice dish in clay pot\" (namesake of the Restaurant), but I'd pick crab over that any time.

This is a late-night spot.  They don't open until 5:00PM, stays open until 3 or 4:00AM the next morning."}
{"text":"After my co worker telling me to come back to try, I've listened to her advice and this is my second time returning to this restaurant. The casserole rice is good as always. The set dinner where you have the dishes to choose from is very reasonably priced, good selection and good portion.

My mom and brother loves their sweet and sour pork, it's very crunchy on the outside. Yesterday the sweet and sour pork was cut a little bigger than normal but they still liked it. Overall, good place for Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Ate at the restaurant and the service brought them down a few notches. Made reservations and there weren't enough seats or place settings when we arrived. What's the point of reservations then??? We ordered typhoon shelter crab which was the highlight for sure but it's not cheap. The honey beef ribs were yummy as were the salt and pepper squid. Service fell flat during the meal: We served ourselves the soup, had to ask for new plates for our crab shells and in general the wait staff was absent when you needed them. Wish the service was on par with the food."}
{"text":"Not the first time here and will not be the last time.  Service is decent and food is quite good.  Not cheap for sure but a change from the typical Chinese food in the area.  Must have clay pot rice.  The other dishes are nothing special."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Bowl Kee since it originally opened and my wife and I are now regulars. 5 stars to me are places that do something exceptional. We keep coming back b/c this is one of the few places where they do real hotpot rice cooked from scratch in clay pots. We usually order from the same round of dishes when we come here: Chicken/Chinese Sausage hotpot, Spicy Fried Squid (they do it really well), Chinese Broccoli w/ Beef, Eggplant or Tofu with Grouper. Everything is good here. Note that they are only open daily for dinner (5pm to late night). Great for the late night crowd. A must try!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is known for its hot stone rice bowls and has been consistent with it for many years. There are different combinations of toppings that you can choose from, Chinese sausages, mushrooms, chicken, pork, or beef. It comes out sizzling hot with a delectable aroma. 

Bowl Kee also offers other dishes from the menu - 3, 4, or 5 dish combos ($39, $49, or $59 respectively) depending on how many people you're ordering for. There is about 25-30 dishes you can choose from and it comes with a large bowl of hot soup and half chicken with the meal. The options that was offered allows a wide range of choices for different appetites. 

We ordered with our 3 dish combo:
Hot stone bowl with been curd and fish - Hot and sizzling. The bean curds and fish were flavourful. It went nicely when accomodated with rice.

Pan-fried tofu and brocoli - Flavour is everything when it comes with tofu and I have to admit that this one was done right. A great options for vegetarians.

Pork chops with special sauce - Always a customer favourite and mine as well. Not too fatty or lean for the pork chops. Sauce was tasty and not overwhelming. 

Overall, a pleasant night experience and will probably be back for more, especially on a cold night."}
{"text":"Cash only policy.

This place specializes in hotpot rice. If you want hotpot rice, they say the minimum serving size is for 2 people. I disliked the fact that the waitress gives you attitude if you don't do it her way. But whatever, hunger and time has too much of a sway. The hotpot rice was good, but I didn't see or taste what would set it apart from any other hotpot rice dish from another restaurant. 

I wouldn't choose to come here again, but I also wouldn't be opposed to coming back.

Price: 3.5/5
Service: 3/5

{"text":"This is a real Cantonese place! I mean not much English on the menu. You got to know what to order! So this place specializing in a Cantonese clay pot rice with choices of fixings on top. I went with the sausage and duck one. They have other clay pot dishes like fish with bitter melon in black bean sauce. All of it is pretty tasty. It's not super greasy or salty here. Service is helpful but they may feel to rush you out because they lack space and their is a real dinner crowd for this place. Give it a try. Won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Honestly not worth the hype for me...definitely had better bowl rice at other places. The price is a little too expensive: $10+ for 2 person bowl. The don't give you a lot of meat either, and the rice was way too dry."}
{"text":"Food is pretty decent but I found it a bit expensive for the hotpot rice. A bowl of hotpot rice for $16 which supposedly feeds two. I think I will dictate how much one bowl will feed...lol

Also got an eggplant dish with fish which was pretty good as well. We ordered a total of 3 dishes here and the bill was over $50 after tax. I didn't even feel like I ate anything other than rice. Even with my negative comments I think the food here is still decent. The service is also excellent for a Chinese restaurant.

Meal also comes with complimentary red bean jelly dessert."}
{"text":"I've not had clay pot rice since I was in Kindergarten, though I still had a faint recollection of what it tasted like. I was yearning for it, and decided to go to Bowl Kee hoping to try clay pot rice for the first time in many years.

The experience met and exceeded my expectations. My family and I got the Chinese sausage, chicken, and mushroom clay pot rice. What makes clay pot rice so unique is that, unlike many other rice dishes, the rice is not first made via a rice cooker - it's cooked directly from the pot with the other ingredients. The rice at the bottom absorbs all the flavors of the ingredients at the top, and you can add soy sauce for a little extra flavor.

Everything came together perfectly, and the chicken was quite flavorful when paired with mushrooms and Chinese sausage. Adding just a little bit of soy sauce gave the dish the little kick that it needed. 

In addition to that, we also ordered fish ball and tofu soup as well as sweet and sour ribs. The soup was absolutely divine, with the fish balls tasting more homemade than store bought. The sweet and sour ribs had a lot of good wok hei, and the ribs themselves had a very nice texture to them.

I'm always a fan of authentic Chinese food, but I infrequently get to experience a meal this tasty and yet so homely. With only one taste, Bowl Kee has become one of my favorite restaurants to eat at in the Markham area."}
{"text":"Haven't come back in literally two decades I think. Tried them when they first opened and there was a dead mouse on the floor.  Told the owner about it and she grabbed my arm screaming saying she was scared!!!!  But that is history.  This place is now very busy and their menu choices are good.  Seating is very packed. TIP: Order a few non pot rice  dishes since you expect to wait a while for pot rice to be cooked. Rice is high quality, long grain and whole.  Dishes are in good portions.  This place needs better ventilation though."}
{"text":"This small canto restaurant is a must try if your like Chinese style stone bowl type rice.

Although we, Chinese, don't actually use stone bowls, the concept is similar.  We use a metal bowl and cook the rice and toppings together.

The quality/ character you look for when eating these rice bowls is the \"crunchiness\" of the rice surrounding the edge. This place is pro at making this traditional Chinese style stone bowl rice - And they have been doing at this same location for at least 20 years!!!

Apart from their restaurant specialty, they also have a stir fry menu. The price is legit, 3 dishes of choice plus half a chicken for $45. Portions are big. I think the stir fried squid with batter is awesome here!

It will be sad to see this family owned and operated restaurant close one day.. they have been running this specialty restaurant for 20 years and counting!! Definitely a successful 5 star restaurant!"}
{"text":"Service is rather slow and $16 for a bowl of rice is expensive.  Food is good but I am sure there are others out there cheaper. if you are in a hurry, better call ahead."}
{"text":"It's completely delicious!!! The hot pot rice is sooo good I don't think anywhere else could make it this great.

The only thing that is keeping it from giving a 5 star is that the prices are a little  high...like the $30/pound typhoon shelter crab hehe but maybe it's totally worth it for some people :p the hot pot rice is pretty worth it. I think the 4 person serving is $25. And it definitely fills 4 people. But the other dishes are also quite expensive, all the dishes are ~$12 and the servings aren't thaaat big. 

yummy overall if you like hot pot rice u gotta come hereeee! It's 10x better than those dim sum rice dishes haha"}
{"text":"Yuuuummm.

I'm only rating this based on their hotpot rice. 
Everything else is better ... anywhere else LOL

But the hotpot rice is very original and they add soup to it later (but beware it is very burnt ... and very Chinese thing to like)

Oh & there might be some Asian families that tend to talk very loud for no reason."}
{"text":"We came here for HK Style Typhoon-shelter Crab. The food at this place is awesome and dis not disappoint. The bad news is parking at this place is horrible and they only take cash. The menu is pretty extensive and offers quite a few combo deals. We ordered a crab and a 3 dish combo. The combo deal came with complimentary soup and desert. But the main dish for us was the crab. It was pretty big and the toppings were so good. I asked for extra rice just so I could eat more anchovy, ground meat and chili. I know they are known for the hot clay pot dishes and the eggplant in the clay pot was good, but the crab really stole the show and the other dishes just were not good enough to pull us away from the crab."}
{"text":"Walked in, the waitress insisted that I can sit anywhere I like. Moments later, the owner came out of the kitchen, and said I couldn't sit at the table I choose. Hmmm.. Monday night, only 1 customer... and very empty. What difference will it make if I sit at that particular table? Never coming here again."}
{"text":"Very delicious food!!!! I took 1 star off due to \"cash only\" polity in a plaza there seems no ATM available. If your friends bring u there u CANT do AA n it's super awkward to ask them to pay for u if you don't have cash. 

Take one more star because I always love hot stone rices but their rice so so chewy! I think they tend to make chewy rices so they won't stick on the bowl. But it's literally causing indigestion afterward. If you love to double chew your food n order other dishes in softer texture to balance out then it would help. Usually the salty cured meat in hot stone rice r chewy too so protein n chew hard rice r double trouble for digestive system. 

I would definitely come back here recommend it to friends!!!! 

Make SURE bringing someone that read Chinese writing! Their menu has NO English translation so u won't be able to read their menu at all!"}
{"text":"The Bowl Kee Restaurant has always been my late late night eating spot in the area. 

The menu is small compared to a lot of other Cantonese restaurants in the area but what they serves are decent and comforting especially after last call!

Oil and Saucy and everything serves sizzling hot. Eggplant with Spicy meat sauce in a hot pot is one of my favourite dish here.

The clay pot rice which suppose to be their speciality though never wow me.

Deco was the same as long as I remember.. but if you are hungry and half drunk, that's the last thing you would have notice!!"}
{"text":"Pricey for a mediocre clay pot rice.

18 dollars for a big pot that is supposed to be for 2 people. It wasn't even big and there were so little meats in it.

Service was bad as she didn't care ro serve us.

Go to green bamboo clay pot rice resto instesd for half thr price.

Absolutely do not recommend this place"}
{"text":"Cute little hotpot rice place.  The service was refreshing, well paced and effective.  No one looked unhappy to be there, and the food was absolutely delicious! Even the chicken that came with the rice was cooked to perfection.  Great food, great price, absolutely gotta come back more often!"}
{"text":"For dinner it's ok.   For 2 a.m. with few alternatives... maybe.

Prices are a little high in my opinion for Markham.   2 normal (non-seafood) dishes came to $27.   Congee Queen/Congee Wong are better values."}
