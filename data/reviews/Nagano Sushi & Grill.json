{"text":"I came here, ordered the cheese wontons, and the tofu noodle dish. My cheese was hard, and I didn't enjoy my dish too much. I'm giving this place on star, because I got sick afterwards from eating here. For two days, and that's why I won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"One of my coworkers told me that he was getting this for lunch the other day and asked me if I wanted anything. He suggested the chicken teriyaki special. We had an old menu and it was listed on the front of the menu as $4.99. They have apparently changed the price to $5.99 I believe. Anyways, my coworker went and picked us up two of these platters. I was actually very impressed. I would have never otherwise tried this place. The chicken wasn't particularly moist but I tend to like clean, oil free grilled chicken so it was perfect for me. I went with the fried rice and it was a little more on the oily side but not overly so. It also came with veggies that were a little on the sweet side and tasty. They gave us a complimentary sweet tea as well which was nice. I've never actually been to the establishment so I can't comment on the service or interior of the business but the food was solid and I will probably get it again in the future especially at the very reasonable price point."}
{"text":"The outstanding decor is matched with excellent service and unbelievably low prices. I had hamachi, unagi and salmon sushi followed by the teriyaki chicken special for only $4.99! It came with fried rice and steamed vegetables, along with YUM-YUM sauce, delicious!!! 
  It was an extremely enjoyable experience. I highly recommend this place to come and have a great meal. We watched the college football game of the week. After we finished the boss let us feed the awesome goldfish. Amy the server payed special attention to all of our needs and the head chef even took time to come to our table and ask how every thing was. Now that's customer service! I highly recommend this restaurant and will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I drove here expecting the crab restaurant that use to occupy this space. I decided to try this new place that has taken over the space. 

I had the Tiger Roll. I noticed the avocados were not ripe. I have never encountered that with Sushi before.

My husband had the grand opening special: Teriyaki chicken. I had a nibble of the chicken and it was a bit dry.  The Teriyaki sauce was good, but the chicken was dry.  Also, the carrots were too sweet.  Take it from someone that avoids sugar there was something too sweet about those carrots.  

The service was good, but we were the only patrons in the establishment and our waiter kind of \"hung\" around too much.  It was a bit unnerving.  

There is nothing wrong with the food here, but I don't think I could say it was anything special, especially for the price."}
{"text":"Great great food with very reasonable prices. Wife ordered habachi steak and i ordered the yakitori chicken. Both were very good. The carrots were delicious. THE CARROTS. How many places do you know that you could talk about their carrots. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I've been here twice with widely varied experiences. I have to say the Teriyaki bowl was pretty fab the first time, but the second time it was cold and over-salted. Same with the egg rolls.

But I really wanna talk about the sushi, specifically the sashimi. The standards were okay: the Hamachi was good, the Unagi was slightly above that, the Masago was decent, and I did really enjoy the smoked tuna. But when your Ika is gummy and a bit slimey between the squid and the rice, well, yuck! And to replace that they gave me Maguro. Nice, right? Not when it looked like Natto! Needless to say, well my stomach sent a message to my mouth to Cease and Desist. It looked like they came out of jar. They stuck together and when I ate a few of the eggs, with trepadation (and out of experimentation) and one popped and they other kind of squished into sluggish Super Salt bombs, well, sorry, but that's lights out for me. I'm done.

And both times, the service was exceptional and very helpful. I just can't get past the food. And with Seafood city just down the road, you know they can get fresh if they wanted to. I don't see this place lasting very long if they keep this up."}
{"text":"Our group ordered the Chicken Teriyaki, Hibachi Steak, Teriyaki Steak(?) and Calamari. The calamari was served hot which is a plus however it is a little overpriced for the serving. The entr√©es are definitely worth the price. It is a full dinner for less than $10. The side carrots are sweet which another plus.  For the environment, it was clean (even the comfort room) the only downside was the temperature. The air conditioning was off, the fan was focused on us but it still didn't beat the Las Vegas heat. There was only another table aside ours at that time, no long wait."}
{"text":"This place us just horrible, DON'T Waste you Time and/or Money here. Not a real Japanese restaurant, McDonald's would be a better choice that here!!! The food is horrible, service was ok? No one knows what their doing. Not sure why they call this a sushi and grill. Nothing here is fresh, & if its not do e right @ all. Wasted time & money."}
{"text":"I ordered the Salmon Tempura Roll & a Tuna Roll. My boyfriend ordered the steak and chicken with fried rice along with miso soup. Our bill came out to about $25 for all of that! That is a really good deal for sushi and for a meat eater! Our server/cashier was very very nice and on top of filling up our waters. Despite what people say, I thought the sushi was very fresh and very fulfilling. As someone who enjoys rice, being a Filipino, I thought it can use more rice but it didn't change how delicious it was!! The chicken was good too!"}
{"text":"They just opened Monday. Food was great. Service was great. I highly recommend! Prices were fair as well."}
{"text":"If this was an established restaurant I'd give them two stars instead of three. They've got a lot of things that need improvement, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.

I had steak teriyaki. The waitress asked me how I wanted my steak cooked, but they cut the meat in cubes prior to cooking so it really didn't matter. Not sure what they were doing for the teriyaki sauce because it really didn't taste much of anything but salt. The meat was on a bed of broccoli florets that was okay. Sides were cooked sliced carrots that were just short of being mush, and fried rice that was oily, clumped together, and some of the rice was dry and crunchy. It came with a small tub of a pinkish sauce on the side. I have no idea what it was for and didn't taste it.

I also ordered the shrimp and vegetable tempura appetizer. It was served last. The shrimp was skinny and the vegetables were unevenly cooked, and the oil tasted stale. The dipping sauce wasn't the usual kind for tempura...instead, it was that orange-chili dip that commonly gets served with eggrolls.

And a couple of minor issues:  I was not given chopsticks (I didn't see any in the restaurant) and though the waitress confirmed that I'd ordered Diet Coke, she brought me regular Coke the first time.

Right now, this restaurant is making me miss the former occupant (Crab Corner) a whole lot more."}
{"text":"I totally agree with Lulu A. 
There are plenty of different restaurants here in Vegas and the family likes to try new ones to give them a chance but unfortunately this is not or was NOT a great choice!!!!
The guys were nice but didn't seem to know too much about the sushi or how to make them. The waiter/cashier didn't seem too motivated to be there. 
We ordered the Dragon Roll which is usually the superior of all sushi. Usually Dragon Rolls have a crispy wrap around the middle and a shrimp tail coming out of one of the ends topped with masago. And 1 more thing, Dragon Rolls are usually bigger. These were tiny. Well that's not what came out. Matter of fact it didn't even come close to the picture in their menu. 
And we also ordered the Crunchy California Roll and out came just a regular California Roll. They took it to the back 5 minutes later out came the Dragon roll which looked like they just topped off the California roll with some tuna and salmon.
Trust me, I don't think this place will last. Just like the previous restaurant that was there which was Crab Corner. That too was not great.
Hey but the only thing nice that came out of this place was the pictures that I took.
Don't waste your time and money."}
{"text":"I was driving by and noticed there grand opening sign with a $4.99 Teriyaki chicken special. Not expecting much I ordered it and extremely surprised. I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Drove by this place and saw the poster for teriyaki chicken so I made a u-turn and went in for a to-go order. I ordered the special. Worst Teriyaki chicken ever. No teriyaki sauce at all, came with very greasy fried rice and broccoli florets and carrot coins. Vegetables were super over cooked and mushy. You could tell they were a frozen product. I ordered a side of vegetable tempura. Very weird tempura batter and you could tell that they fried it in the same oil as fish. All the vegetables had fish flavor. This place will not be open long."}
{"text":"The sushi is ok. I wouldnt recommend them for sushi but the food menu is really good. Hibachi chicken and soba noodles are really good and the shrimp sauce is delicious! I hope they stay around for a while since I work near by. Clean place and friendly spot give it a try."}
{"text":"Came and ordered the hibachi steak combo and veggie tempura . It came with a broth appetizer. Pretty good. The hibachi combo was 7.99 and worth it. Appearance wise, I thought it was going to be overly sauced. The rice was delicious, as was the steak. I took a bite of the carrots to be a little healthy. I was expecting it to be bland in flavor. Just steamed. Surprisingly, it was delicious. On the sweeter side. Similar to yams. I really enjoyed it. Decor was nice and clean. Not busy. Server was very nice. Attentive. I will be back."}
{"text":"A la carte/ cheap price/ small business/ no long wait/ not busy

Food: was quick, the taste was normal, the roll had a little bit fish and too much rice. 
Service: was good.

3/5 because too much rice in the roll

Nothing special but cheap price"}
{"text":"I came here with my husband and son late evening. We were literally the only ones there. They had a teriyaki special for $5 and it was good except that the rice was extremely oily. I understand rice is oily but not to the extreme where if you squeeze it all the oil comes out. I ordered the California roll and they were tiny! Half the size of the ones at Yama Sushi. I always go to Yama Sushi therefore I am used to their sushi. Other than that the place was very clean."}
{"text":"Found my new favorite sushi spot!  I came here because I'm a costumer of Eden Nails & Spa (the best nail salon around) and the owner's husband opened up this restaurant. Had to stop by and show some love. Great food & even better people. Can't beat amazing costumer service!"}
{"text":"Pretty darn good! My waiter was kind and knowledgeable of the menu. I ordered the c roll and the tiger roll which were delicious"}
{"text":"There was no one in the restaurant, but I know it is new so I wanted to try it out. The fish quality was poor. The rainbow roll...the fish was so thin and the rice was really warm...bad combination. Same with the yellowtail roll and Salmon sushi. 

Go to Yama sushi down the street...if you are in the area."}
