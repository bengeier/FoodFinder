{"text":"I invited some friends based onthe yelp reviews and I was very excited to try this place. . I was very disapointed, The service is poor, some orders never arrived. The kitchen was short 3 cooks."}
{"text":"Great place! Service was absolutely fantastic and so friendly -- the staff here really make you feel welcome in their fine establishment. We ordered the torched mackerel, yellow tail sashimi which had some spicy chili oil, microgreens, and peanuts on it, the BBQ eel bibimbap, and the yuzu ramen.   The torched mackerel was mindblowing. I think the server mentioned that they marinate the mackerel in a mixture to get that complexity of flavour. Honestly, it's a beautiful mouthful after mouthful with this dish. The yellow tail sashimi was a great, melt-in-your-mouth texture and the kick from the chili oil was fantastic. The BBQ eel bibimbap, mentioned by many other reviews, was rich and smoky. Yummy.  Now, the yuzu ramen was definitely the weakest dish of what we ordered. It's a dry ramen (so no soup broth). Everything except the grilled shrimp was kind of bland, which was disappointing. That being said, the shrimp was grilled to perfection.   All in all, a great experience. The yuzu ramen brings it down from a perfect score from me, but I'll definitely be trying this place again!"}
{"text":"Cute place  Good food - I went twice already in less than a week lol~"}
{"text":"Nice Japanese beer, pork over rice also good. Restaurant is nice and clean."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant with my family. When we ordered, they were very polite and picked trash too. One of the best parts was the food. DUH. It was delicious and they prepared the food like it was our last meal. It was super fancy! We ordered many things like spicy udon, ramen, steak, rice bowl, fried teriyaki, and chicken. The was probably one of the best Japanese restaurants in Montreal!  #IZAKAYAMARUSANRESTAURANT #Oneofthebest"}
{"text":"So happy to find some authentic Japanese food in downtown!  Seems very popular among office employees and Japanese people who've heard there's now a place for homey food.  We went there for lunch during the weekday and it was busy, but there were plenty of seats available because some customers place orders to go and eat at their office.  Luckily the line was fast and our food arrived to our table so quickly.  We ordered Katsudon (rice bowl topped with deep-fried pork cutlet, egg and veggies) and Kaisendon (rice bowl topped with sashimi raw fish) and they were both really, really good.  The materials seemed fresh and the flavors reminded me of Tokyo.  In Montreal, I don't know any other place that serves donburi or \"bowl dishes\" such as Katsudon Tonkatsu or Katsu Curry-don, so we gave those dish a try and were happy we did.   Love the atmosphere which is bright with natural light.  The interior is modern and warm with clean white walls.  The owner of the restaurant is also Japanese and he was out there, greeting us and other customers.  I would go back and try other things on the menu :)  Prices were good.  Can not wait to come back here for dinner as well.   Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Very unique style, having different menus per odd or even day in a week. Visited four month ago. The owner was very warmhearted. Fantastic foods with good service. Worth to be back."}
{"text":"Made reservations here for dinner and it was excellent. They seated the three of us in a cozy spot in the back. The food was outstanding, we had the best beef tartare I've ever tasted, as well as ramen, yaki udon and some sushi. The other dishes were great, but the tartare was some next-level stuff. The staff was great, attentive, but not hovering, and gladly answered any of our questions. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Wow great food, great prices, great staff. Taste like I am back in Japan. They have great sushis and plates ready in less then 5 minutes. My new favourite lunch place."}
{"text":"I never give good reviews because I'm selfish and I don't want amazing restaurants being taken for granted of by you over sensitive \"foodies\"....... \"I would have given this place 5 stars but I woke up and the moon wasn't quite right then I tripped and stubbed my small toe on my left foot, which is my better foot, then we arrived at the restaurant and my food was perfect and the experience was amazing. But like I said I never give 5 stars because I know more about food then professionally trained chefs because I watch \"hells kitchen\" and that guy taught me everything!  Anyway enough with you!    This establishment deserves 10 big juicy stars in my opinion!    1. Food - high kick worthy 2. Employees- double high kick, everyone was so nice! 3. Price - on point! High kick!   I really really really like this restaurant! :)"}
{"text":"Went for dinner. No one else was there!  Sushi: nice! affordable. be warned there is cucumber in everything.  Udon: good!   Tempura: decent.   service- great  ambiance- comfortable  Overall This is a nice place to go for a simple meal. Would go back!"}
{"text":"Inredibly salty food that all tastes the same, drowned in soy sauce, including the salad. Delightful waitress and good sake. Not a rewarding dinner experience"}
{"text":"Since the first time I stepped inside this place, I was amazed by the welcoming staff and the friendly owner. The space is really modern and suitable for a quick lunch or for a happy hour. Their menu is affordable and authentic. The udon noodles are delicious and the curry is to die for. They also have sushi and other items from the fridge that you can just pick up and go! The owner is passionate about his food and tries to make every experience unforgettable. Overall, if you're around the old port, stop for a nice japanese meal in a cozy and modern environment."}
{"text":"\"Shots shots shots shots shots shots Shots shots shots shots shots Shots shots shots shots shots Everybody!\"  We came here for a girls date night and enjoyed really really yummy food (3.5/4 star Yelp quality because this is Montreal and it's really really competitive to get a 5) but our waiter kept stopping at our table to hand out drinks! That's never happened to me in Montreal before, so yes! a big 5 for great service!   I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Small but excellent japanese restaurant. Weekly changing menue of specials.  Good selection of sake and friendly staff.  Only one table for bigger group and two for parties up to 4; rest is 2 person tables"}
{"text":"Trendy, intimate, tasty. The food is fantastic and the first time I went there with a date, our server gave us complementary asparagus tempura at the start of the meal and complementary shots of sake and frozen pineapple at the end. Great spot. 10/10."}
{"text":"Amazing Japanese food and drinks, wonderful service and trendy atmosphere!  I really loved the freshness of the ingredients  as well. I will definitely continue returning to this fine establishment;)"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with Marusan. The only spot where you can find tasty, pretty authentic and original Japanese izakaya style dishes and simple curry lunches. The staff is awesome, by far the friendliest in the whole neighbourhood. These guys know how to cook the perfect rice (a corner stone of Japanese cuisine that's not a easy to pull off as most people think)"}
{"text":"Holy shit I can't believe I still haven't rated my favorite place right now. I work from the Crew café so I'm here at least once or twice a week. Lunch: solid options. I get the Katsu curry, chicken karaage, gyudon and ebi-teri don.  Grab a few beers after work (happy hour specials on the Sapporo) and order a few plates from their izakaya-inspired menu. Try the chicken wings, the bibimbap, or any of the soba noodles.  Say hi to the owner Hide or chef Hachiro.  Arigatou gozaimasu"}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing Japanese food!!  Is there ANYTHING not great here?  We LOVED the Japanese bibimbop, the udon noodles, the salmon sushi, the tuna!!  Just wonderful service and fresh, delicious, visually appealing food!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful lunch place. Quaint little place with great food. The chicken teriyaki bento box is awesome. Great flavor  you can also ask for brown rice ( really good) .  If you are craving for fresh food this is the place."}
{"text":"This was excellent. A friendly and helpful staff took care of our large group. Great food and fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"We had Gyudon and Pork Katsu Curry for lunch.  Beef in Gyudon is moist and flavourful, but could use a little more to cover the rice.  The Pork Katsu is better tenderized than my previous visit, and curry is good but no potato/carrot in it. :o  Overall good quality and price is reasonable.  Definitely worth a visit.  Japanese food is not limited to ramen and sushi!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious, high quality and inexpensive. The wasabi octopus appetizer rocked my world. If you are a fan of wasabi, such as I, and are not afraid of octopus I would highly recommend this dish. The udon beef noodle soup was not spicy at all and the broth was dense from the meat. The ambiance is classy but not too formal. The staff was kind and happy to answer any questions about the dishes."}
{"text":"Marusan is a solid Japanese restaurant and trendy spot in Montreal. The ambiance is very modern, service was very friendly, and food was delicious.   We started off with the wings - fully flavored with garlic sauce and meat made tender - and had the udon noodles in peanut sauce, salmon and avocado sushi, and ramen noodles as mains. Got the Hickson IPA to pair.   The udon was dope, great recommendation by our waitress. Sushi was a bit smaller in portion than we expected, and the ramen didn't have much broth as we were hoping. Nevertheless, great meal and would definitely come back for a fix of modern Japanese. Great for groups, dates, solo meals, and everything in between!"}
{"text":"We've been in Montreal for the past four days and found this restaurant around the corner from the W hotel.  It's a small but impeccably kept Japanese restaurant.  Very warm place on a sub zero night.  We shared many dishes.  Salmon rolls, mackerel rolls, beef appetizer, tofu & mushrooms, ramen noodles, lobster salad and the almond dessert.  Delicious authentic food.  High grade meat, fish and produce.  Five star level on the nutrition scale.  Everything arrived quickly, service was excellent.  Restrooms about the cleanest in any place we've visited in Montreal.  Staff extremely attentive.  This place has limited seating but worth the wait.  A place we'll absolutely put on our must go to list on future visits to Montréal."}
{"text":"I finally came here again, and I was not disappointed! The ambiance is very nice, great restaurant for a date night.  My favorites were the karaage and takoyaki. It was great! My only complain is that the menu isn't too big compared to other izakayas in Montreal."}
{"text":"Good place to drink, chill and vibes with friends. The waiters and waitresses are very friendly and nice. Excellent service! I didn't try their food, but their drinks are very original. It seems like a very good place for nice dates. Definitely coming back for their food!"}
{"text":"Came here a few times for both lunch and dinner. The ambiance is completely different.   At lunch you have a few choices of meal such as the salmon tuna bowl or the curry. They're all around 10-15$ and all very tasty.   In the evening, everything changes (when the fire nation attacked...). It becomes one of those noisy izakaya with many more choices on the menu. Their cocktails are also pretty good.   The service is great. Our waiter made recommendations and gave me one of those japanese leaves to try because i didnt know what it was and it was in their mojito.   Anyway, a good place to go for a quick lunch or to chill after work."}
{"text":"My favorite spot for lunch in Old Montreal. Not a fan of the Dinner menu, but still love this place."}
{"text":"Owner/chef Hide is a tremendous host who makes all his guests feel special, and his food is wonderful. He serves best-quality sashimi. Everything is fresh and delicious. I highly recommend the soft Japanese-style egg with roe, shiso and urchin--just delicious. The cocktails are terrific as well...there is one with smoky lapsang souchong that is unique and super tasty. 'Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"This japanese place in Old Port is pretty bomb. Their spicy fried chicken is nice and juicy, and the other dish I had with caviar, eggs and some torched seafood (that I cannot remember) was really good too. It made me feel a bit fancy - so yeah, would recommend.  The cocktails were not bad, the matcha cocktail was a bit weird though."}
{"text":"Great place to try pressed sushi and sake. People are really friendly and food is amazing."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly and food is amazing! I wish I have more space so I can try every single dishes on the menu. They all seem great and taste even bette! Highly recommend it! It's worth to come to this place. I came to Marsusan twice for dinner during my trip in Montreal and it's  the best food I've had so far. I will definitely visit this restaurant again if I'm back to Montreal."}
{"text":"So glad we found this place while walking around in Old Montreal!  Place has a great vibe! Forget about the sushi everywhere...this is quality, authentic Japanese food!  We were greeted and served by the owner, originally from Japan.  Kaisen Don and Beef Curry were quite tasty!"}
{"text":"Excellent small little place with great quality real Japanese food. Super friendly staff and very fast service. I will be back for sure! :)"}
{"text":"The restaurant is cozy and the staff are very nice. Service if very fast! Went there for lunch both times. Tried their salmon-tun bowl, which was not bad. Not the best that I had, but it was good. Also tried their gyudon, it was tasty!  Good for people who works in the old port and wants to grab a quick lunch!"}
{"text":"Great food with new flavors! Service was very attentive and the chef was very careful about our food allergies."}
{"text":"Trendy, small, attentive service, very flavorful meals. Not traditionally Japanese, but more of a fusion. Sushi is pressed and deconstructed, for example. The fried tofu was a little congealed on the outside - tasty but odd - but the bibimbap was excellent as was the hangar steak. Our friendly waiter squeezed in a happy hour Sapporo special for us just under the deadline. Our cozy booth was perfect for two, but my companion's feet got too hot next to the heater.  I wouldn't hesitate to go here again, but for lunch."}
{"text":"Very hip place! The food is more izakaya style, smaller portion plates. The taste was great though and very flavourful. We tried some interesting dishes such as tan tan udon, pork belly bibimbap, aburi salmon sushi and pork belly kushiage. My favourite was the aburi sushi - torched perfectly and very flavourful.  The 5 stars goes to the owner who came around and offered us free shots on the house, really nice of him to do that as we were a group of 7. Def coming back if I'm ever in Montreal again!"}
{"text":"The experience was phenomenal! Atmosphere, service, and food was out of this world! Absolutely some of the best sushi I have had in North America!!!"}
{"text":"This place is really good, very good food, decent service, a good choice of sake and other alcohols."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim because it was close and the reviews were pretty good. The price was decent for a restaurant in the old port area. However, service was quite slow since I waited around half an hour before my bibimbap came and then 40 minutes for my fried tofu appetizer. The spring greens in my bibimbap gave me an \"Asian confusion\" vibe, but the flavour of the braised pork was not bad. Finally the udon came last after 50 minutes of waiting. My friend was ready to just cancel the order. I would've like it if the portions were a bit bigger. My experience here was lack lustre and I think there are way better choices for Japanese food in Montreal. A passable place for me."}
{"text":"We reserved same day through the Yelp app... it was so easy!  It was a Saturday night seating.   The service was great! We had a vegan friend in our group, and the wait staff graciously checked with the kitchen staff, which items could be adjusted for their needs.  The Ramen noodles (w/o broth) was a great surprise. The chili oil really adds a nice bite/flavor combination.   The skewers, were very well cooked (battered) and crispy. We especially liked the pork belly.   By the end of the service, the manager came by to make sure our experience was too our satisfaction.   Very impressed at their dedication to service. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"OK so funny story: Went here on a date, the date dint go so well, free expression of ideas and half way through I was eating by myself, lol. I guess the server felt bad so he brought me couple glasses of plum wine on the house, exactly what I needed! So I stayed, finished both mine and her plates and had desert. The food was good, the sushi was a real nice quality for Montreal, and everything was presented really well. The pricing was fair as well, definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Menu original. Délicieux. Très bon service. À prix raisonnable. Ça vaut le détour. Les mabo-ramen et le kara age furent excellents."}
{"text":"- Cozy and smooth place. The music was great, at the perfect volume, and the lighting was beautiful. Perfect for a date.  - The food was absolutely delicious. Love that they change some items of their menu every week depending on what's fresh. The yellowtail carpaccio and fried tofu were absolutely delicious and the shrimp sashimi as fresh as it could be. The chicken wings were the only disappointing plate ($7 for 2 wings could seem overly expensive, even if they are delicious). - Service was on point, with regular water refills and detailed descriptions of every plate when they got to our table.  - Would go again and bring family, friends, and dates!"}
{"text":"Great food, great music (Saturday night local djs), great staff ! Thank you Marusan - see you again very soon !!"}
{"text":"Best Japanese food I've had for a while, and I' a New Yorker. Lovely place and lovely service. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"So amazing! Authentic and delicious. I was very impressed because I have severe food allergies and the waitress was very considerate and able to recommend several dishes for me, both of which were amazing and allergy-free. I felt absolutely safe eating here (which is rare for me; nuts and eggs are hard allergens to avoid!!) and had a delicious meal that I cannot stop thinking (or talking) about. I didn't catch the waitress' name but she was so so wonderful and I am so grateful for her help!"}
{"text":"Excellent Ramen! Wonderful service. cold Sapporo!  The food in general was excellent and authentic, atmosphere modern and fresh. We do not hesitate to recommend."}
{"text":"This is not Japanese food. I ordered ramen noodle but I got Dry Ramen instead!!! It is soba noodle. Don't advertise ramen when you serving \"yakisoba\". Btw my wife makes way better mama noodle than your \"ramen\". Oh yeah curry is only served during lunch. Seriously. I've spent 3 years in Japan and never seen any \"Japanese\" restaurant like this. I should have known when I saw bimimbap on the memo. Don't come here if you want real Japanese food. This is better classified as Asian fusion."}
{"text":"They have a very good Japanese curry which is hard to find in Montreal. Authentic place. Small cute dinning room. Worth it."}
{"text":"Interesting, different, creative, menu. Leans toward fishy flavors.  Probably more authentic than our group expected. Included some Korean flavors. Generally, we liked our choices, but would not go back.  Good quality, just not what we were looking for.  Our server was great, yes we did have table service for dinner.  It is only counter service at lunch.   The beef choice (cooked to a perfect med-rare) was thoroughly enjoyed by Dad, and made the rest of us jealous.  The miso soup included fish cake, not to my husband's liking, so I ate it.  The chicken balls came with a spicy mayo-sauce which may be too hot for some tongues.   Pork belly entree was delicious, and long on sesame oil; again, not to daughter's liking, so I ate it.   For the adventurous, I would recommend this small, hole in the wall, Asian \"diner.\" PS: I was a tourist to Montreal, therefore I would enjoy trying other restaurant options on another visit. If I were a local, I'm sure I would frequent this restaurant more often."}
{"text":"Had the Kaisen Don and the miso soup. Absolutely amazing and fresh. Portions are fair for the price. The rice is flavourful and the food pairings were great. Rice-seafood ratio is good, there isn't an overwhelming amount of rice in comparison to the amount of seafood.   Miso soup is good, would be better with more seaweed.   A must!"}
{"text":"Located close to Le Westin in Montreal this was a wonderful treat. Late night dinner with little appetite soon turned ravenous with a bite into the braised pork bibimbap. The fun cocktail creations using sake added to the experience together with staff that aimed to please. Attentive service and great food highly recommended"}
{"text":"Fabulous food, drinks and service.  We will go back!  The oyster balls were perfect, as were the mackerel and the fried chicken appetizers.  The sesame noodles and Bibambop were also exceptional, some of the best we've ever had.  Nice saki recommendation by the capable waitress and a delicious mojito.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Commençons par le service, rien à redire sinon parfait, le personnel est présent sans s'imposer, courtois, souriant, serviable.... La carte est originale en comparaison de nombreux restaurant japonais, la qualité des produits est au rendez-vous pour une addition plus que raisonnable. Bref je recommande sans hésitation."}
{"text":"This place was a highlight of our trip to Montreal.  Our children were expecting more conventional sushi rolls but ate everything that was brought to us with gusto.  And I can see why.  The food was amazing.  Atmosphere was nice.  Staff friendly.  Well worth a trip."}
{"text":"I'm so happy I tried out this place, it was such a delightful experience. Seeing the many photos of their donburi and bento menu is what got me really excited about Marusan since there doesn't seem to be a lot of places that offer that type of Japanese comfort food. However I came here on a date with my boyfriend on a Saturday night so we ended up trying their izakaya menu. We shared takoyaki, chicken karaage, wasabi beef tartare and quail eggs and pork kushikatsu (small skewers). Everything was super tasty, we even thought it was better than similar dishes at other izakayas in town.   The mood of the restaurant is very nice, it was perfect for a date. The music reminded me of the Kill Bill soundtrack and wasn't too loud so we could still hold a conversation easily. The service was really fast and courteous. Everyone was nice and they even offered sake shots on the house when we left. We'll definitely be back, I still have to try the donburi!  LUNCH EDIT  I am so crazy about this place, I just keep coming back! Since my first visit to Marusan for dinner, I've been here for lunch quite a bit and It. So. Does. Not. Disappoint.  I haven't been to all the Japanese restaurants in Montreal of course, but as far as I know Marusan is one of the only places serving this type of Japanese comfort food. I'm still eating my way through their lunch menu, but so far everything I've tried has been delicious. The flavours are really authentic. I recommend the katsudon and gyudon especially!"}
{"text":"Really cute place, perfect for a date and the staff is super nice! I had the sour yuzu drink which was well made and worth the 11$. My boyfriend got Suntori whisky which came in the cutest whiski glass. Food wise, we hade tuna tataki, takoyaki, chicken karaage and sum katsu skewers. Typical bistro japanese dishes that taste delicious. We also got a fresh vegetables plate with different dippings. Not a good choice. The sauces were too salty and we ended up just eating plain veggies. Not a recommendation."}
{"text":"A delightful discovery close to our hotel - the unusual Japanese menu is what drew us to check this place out. And though we weren't hungry, all the mouthwatering options just sounded too good to pass up. And they didn't disappoint. Definitely try the Tantan Udon. The sausage appetizer was part of a special menu but maybe they'll make them permanent because it's worth trying! Do the non-fried dishes over the fried ones because the flavors are so rich and worth tasting- don't let the fried dishes kill that off. Definitely go!"}
{"text":"Teriyaki karaage here is delicious. Better than the spicy mayo in my opinion. Takoyaki also isn't bad. The drinks!! The mixed calpico drink is really good--they also ran out of grapefruit so the manager offered to make it with yuzu instead and it was delicious. The restaurant is small but that doesn't kill the vibes! Service is amazing, I highly recommend. It's pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"Nice food.  Spot on preparation.  Really bad choice to bring kids.  Drink prices are very steep for what you get.  Recommend the clam special.  Finally, the inside was BLAZING hot.  Numerous people were complaining and sweating."}
{"text":"Recomendado! platos menos comerciales y más auténticos y excelente servicio."}
{"text":"the place was very modern and authentic feel at the same time. was very surprise how delicious it was for a Canadian branch of Japanese food. Enjoyed it very much"}
{"text":"I didn't even get to take pictures, everything was so tasty. Since I go to school in upstate NY, there's not much good Japanese because I grew up with good eats in LA. This place hit the spot! While it's not your typical sushi/teriyaki whatever spot, they do serve things that appeal to even the unadventurous. I loved everything we got and will definitely be back if I find myself in Montreal soon. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Service: 5/5 We had a lovely waitress, who helped us out with a saké selection and offered the top saké at a reasonable price due to the fact our choice saké was sold out. The other staff who helped seat us were also lovely.  Food: 4/5 Unfortunately, my partner and I have  had better sushi, although not in Montreal as we are tourists. The scallop sashimi was not the best we had since it was more \"fishy\" than others we have had. The salmon was not particularly fatty either. For the price, I would have expected slightly higher quality."}
{"text":"This place has authentic Japanese food and was a great find for lunch.  On this day, we ordered the poke bowl and pork katsu bento, and they were both delicious!  The rice was of high quality, and the sashimi in the poke bowl was prepared fresh.  For a lunch stop, we would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Freshly made rolls. Awesome rice bowls with perfectly cooked rice and well seasoned toppings. A poached egg to top of it all. A really friendly set of staff and decent price (for the Old Port) to tie it all together.  Great experience!"}
{"text":"Cool little Japanese restaurant in the old Montreal area. The area needs something refreshing like this.  Got the beef bowl with a soft poached egg. It tasted really good, especially with the egg. They also give you extra seasoning if you need some. The rice were well cooked.  Very nice guy at the cashier, greeted us with great big smile."}
{"text":"Wow, I'm really sad (T_T) to have to write this review cause I liked Marusan!!  The review is low only because I got them to cater for our company lunch. The food was only okay to my shock and disappointment. Marusan, we thought you could do much better!! I had two other people who were fans and were seriously excited to have you guys for lunch but ended up somewhat underwhelmed by the lunch as well.   For some reason the presentation was average and the food was delivered too early so it was cold by the time we ate it. The chicken in the EBI-TERI BENTO was just brown but not an attractive, glossy brown. Just brown. The \"salad\" was just a few leafs of spring mix lettuce and really sad and lonely for a salad...maybe because their lettuce leaf friends were still hanging out in the salad box at the resto kitchen?   They're truly a good resto, no doubt.  But it didn't go so well with the catering sadly.  I wish it could've been as great as an experience as it were in the resto cause now my colleagues aren't impressed with my choice of food!"}
{"text":"Was so excited after reading all the reviews! It's a pretty cool hip place for a quick lunch or after work 5à7 or a place to impress your date. It's definitely an Instagram or FB spot... you know... the place u post about it so you can feel you are cool or part of the \"in\" crowd. The only reason I give this place a 3 stars was the \"8 piece veggie sushi\"! Go ahead and order them if u want to spent $8 (or was it $11?!) for 3 edamame beans on a small bed of rice.  I am not joking... 3 beans on a bed of rice. There were 3 slices of cucumber size smaller than my finger nails on there too. When we saw the plate arrived on our table...My friend and I looked at each other like... WTF.  But we really can't complain about it because that will make us uncool in this hipster cool spot. I actually debate with myself on whether I should make this post or not since everyone seems to LOVE this place... but... nobody should pay $8 (or was it $11?!) for 3 edamame beans. I will go back and try other dishes for sure... the noodles were great actually. Just not the veggie sushi. There.. I said it :)"}
{"text":"I am visiting Montreal the first time. This restaurant is 200 m from where I stay with good reviews on Yelp, so I gave it a try.    I came here for lunch on Wednesday and there were about 15 people before me.  The restaurant is clean and modernly decorated. The staff are nice.  I ordered poke bowl.  The fish was fresh and it has good flavor. The rice was just okay.  I had better rice and poke bowls, so would give it a four stars, not five."}
{"text":"The food was really tasty, the sake selection is amazing, and the service was very friendly and helpful. Great choice for dinner."}
{"text":"Un pur régal!  Des produits frais, une ambiance sympathique. Ne pas louper les nouilles youdon épicé  : une tuerie!  Le saké offert par la maison.  Et pour couronner le tout, une addition tout à fait raisonnable! Merci, on reviendra!"}
{"text":"Great place!  wait time: it get really busy around lunch time, so if you want to sit and eat come early!! they open at 11:30 and 20 mins in there was a big line!   Food quality was good, the portion & price made sense if you take into account the location, but I wish they put slightly more haha   I would definately come again !"}
{"text":"super petit resto, la nourriture est très simple mais c'est exactement le genre de simplicité qui vous fait sourire parce que c'est bon, c'est exactement \"miam\" qu'on a envie de dire après la première bouchée. Le service était hyper sympathique, l'ambiance relax. Exactement ce dont on avait envie par un mardi soir d'hiver. Les prix sont excellents et les aliments sont frais."}
{"text":"Wow, wow WOW!! We will make this place our home indeed. It is one thing when the food is authentic & amazingly tasty (for a fair price too) -- and that, it was, but when on top of that the staff is THE FRIENDLIEST and most polite, efficient and cute ever, what else can you ask for?! It was perfection!!!! People like the owner of Marusan are rare nowadays, I have an immense respect for passionate people such as your chefs and your team!! Gochisosama deshita :3 Mata, ne!!"}
{"text":"toute l'intimité d'un japonais de qualité, dans une ambiance décontracté et un service offert par des gens qui connaissent réellement leur plat.   let's be honnest : si on ne parle pas japonais, les menus des restaurants nipon sont bien souvent un charabia incompréhensibles. Mais chez Marusan, tout est bien expliqué en français et en anglais. De plus, les serveurs travaillent également en cuisine et connaissent les plats sur le bout de leur doigts.   l'ambiance est très 'lunch' ou souper rapide entre ami. Le genre d'endroit où l'on peut venir manger seul sans problème et faire de belles rencontres. Si vous êtes trois ou plus, une réservation est recommandée.   Négatif : le manque de place et le confort.  Le positif : tout le reste. On retourne !"}
{"text":"I've been here once for dinner and a few times for lunch and it's completely different depending on which meal you go for.  For dinner, it's mostly smaller plates. Their menu changes often (daily?) But they have a ton of interesting options. One standout we had was tempura brie...I mean how could you go wrong . We also had an octopus salad, a ramen dish and a few other plates. It was definitely good, but a little pricey because the plates are so tiny.   For lunch it's a great place to grab some awesome Japanese comfort food. Katsu don, katsu curry, chicken karaage, udon - everything has been very good and it's way cheaper. About $12 ish which is comparable to many surrounding lunch spots. I love grabbing food from here. The space isn't big but you can also sit down and they're generally pretty fast.   All in all a solid place with pleasant people who work there."}
{"text":"This restaurant was very good. The service was impeccable. We were greeted promptly and had an excellent waiter. The food is authentic, and very tasty. We had octopus appetizer and pork udon soup."}
{"text":"The night started weak, but ended STRONG. The staff was incredibly nice. A few mishaps happened but they were quick to fix all issues. The food had a lot of flavour. The lighting was very bright, but they dimmed it as soon as we asked. Just love how accommodating it was. Great experience. Perfect everything. Will be returning again!"}
{"text":"An absolute gem! I recently experienced a business meal (with a close friend as well) at Marusan and it was truly an extraordinary (see photos) dining experience. The food was just impeccable, the flavours were out of this world, the hospitality was on point, and overall a pure pleasure. Authentic Japanese cuisine, but recreated and reinterpreted by Chef Hideyuki and his team. Overall, extremely well executed; will be back!"}
{"text":"Super bon resto japonais, raffiné et original (style pub japonais). Belle décoration et cadre agréable. Service très courtois et attentionné. Prix abordables."}
{"text":"I am an Asian food lover, which is why, I am always looking to try good Asian restaurants. Having read so many amazing reviews, I walked in with very high expectations. Hubby and I ordered the spicy chicken karaage, udon noodles curry, fried mushroom skewers and spicy tuna sushi. The udon dish was quite flavourful and the chicken was alright. What I wasn't impressed by, was the service. The customer service was horrible. Hence, the 3 stars. Also, don't think we will be going back."}
{"text":"Wanted katsudon, this hit the spot. The pork was tender, juicy, breading well-done, all the things you want--ginger, scallions, chili paste--were available and great."}
{"text":"Finalement donburi! Cuisine japonaise peu exploré encore ici. Service rapide, repas délicieux!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this \"authentic\" izakaya restaurant out after one of my friends tried it and loved it. I made a res here to celebrate with my best friend and husband and baby who are visiting from out of town. We were seated promptly and offered a high chair (great so far! But went downhill quickly)  We ordered some beers to start off while we looked at the menu. The waitress came by and suggested we order a few dishes to start off with and then add more as we go. We decided on the edamame, chicken kaarage and the 5 kinds of sashimi platter (salmon, scallop, albacore, hamachi and spot prawn). The edamame was overly salted but it was fine since you can scrape off the extra salt to your taste. Chicken kaarage was nice and crispy and the mayo was flavourful and spicy. At this point, the waitress came back and we ordered 4 more dishes and another round of drinks. Then the sashimi came out and it didn't look like what we ordered so we asked a server why there was no spot prawn or hamachi and instead two other types of fish. The server then explained that they changed the sashimi platter recently. But the menu did not reflect this nor did the waitress say anything when she took the order or dropped off the plate to us. Then we asked if they had any spot prawn sashimi left (because that's why we ordered it and it was listed as a separate menu item too) and he said he'd go check. He came back and said the spot prawn they received wasn't fresh and these other fish they replaced it with was fresher. It would have been nice to be told this either as we ordered or as they brought the plate out so we could decide if we wanted to order it or not as 2/5 of the sashimi was not what was advertised. After we finished this, we waited 30 mins with no food coming out even though we had ordered more dishes already and the same waitress who took our order came over and asked us if we'd like to order more food. We told her she already took our order for more food and it hasn't come out yet (she totally didn't remember). She apologized and said she'd check on it and it'd be right out. 10 mins pass and she did not come back but another server came over to clear our table and we asked him again if the food was still coming. He didn't know so he went to find our waitress who tells us the food was coming out right now (it wasn't). We asked her what happened and she said their order ticket printer ran out of paper and it just so happened when they replaced the paper, it skipped our order. And she said this happens every two weeks or so and is super frustrating (hello?? If it happens every two weeks shouldn't you do something to fix this reoccurring issue?). She then goes again to check on our food. So in fact the order was not ready as they didn't even have the order in the kitchen! Then another server came by so we told him if the food hasn't been started yet we'd rather cancel the order since we'd been there over an hour already (and had a hungry baby with us). We get the bill and it's $80 for our drinks and 3 appetizers (the waitress took off one beer as an apology to us which was a nice gesture but didn't make up for the ruined dinner celebration). The waitress could have easily put our order to the kitchen immediately after we brought it to her attention the first time.  It's just super disappointing that we were trying to treat our friends who were visiting us from out of town to a celebratory meal and it ended up being super disappointing and even embarrassing (everyone was joking about how hungry they were). Especially disappointing when your friends are only here for the weekend and we wasted a Friday night dinner on this when we could have gone to any one of the other excellent restaurants in this city!  I was excited to bring more friends here but can't support a restaurant who's so incredibly incompetent and disorganized even if they can make great food (if it ever makes it in front of you)."}
{"text":"What a great place! Perfect date night spot in the old port. Would get 5 stars except two things: 1) came for the chicken katsu which has great reviews only to find it is seasonal and the menu could be larger; 2) they messed up our first sushi order - but did replace it with the albacore which was great. We also sent back the \"original style\" ramen which lacked flavor.   Pros: super friendly staff, intimate seating, hot Saki cocktails are incredible, pricing is sensible, the good items are really good!"}
{"text":"Comeparing to Toronto's Guu, this place is like nothing. Things tasted just ok and I'm not impressed at all. It's well-decorated, but who cares. In general, the food's good, but not good enough."}
{"text":"Definitely glad I came by to try this delicious Japanese restaurant for dinner. Their dishes are made with precision and everything tasted great. Would definitely recommend the unagidon with Ikura and the Mackerel Pressed Sushi. Oh and the soy sauce ice cream was pretty amazing."}
{"text":"Definitely check out this Authentic Japanese spot in old Montreal. They are quite new (6 months old when I wrote this review) and the menu is quite unique. We called on a Thursday evening around 7:15pm and asked if we could get a table for 2 around 8pm. The woman on the phone was just lovely and when we arrived we had a table reserved for us.   They just started their special Thursday and Friday menu a week ago (pic attached). My friend was not able to have anything raw so we opted for the veggie sushi (yum!), the ramen noodles and the Takoyaki with the classic sauce (what flavour!).   Great atmosphere and service. A must try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"When it's the last night of fireworks in Montreal and it's a Saturday, one should assume parking is impossible in the old port. It took us 1 hours to find a spot, at which point we were 25 mins late to our reservation, but Marusan was kind enough to held our spot after we called to inform them.  Food over all were very good. We preferred the pressed salmon over the mackerel. The clams were excellent. The hamachi carpaccio was not a hit with us as it tasted more Chinese than Japanese, with the chili oil.   One comment about the service was they should have paced the food as it was a tiny table and since we ordered six items and they all came at once, we neither had the real estate on the table nor the time to eat the food while some of them were hot. (Hence for my not perfect score).   Like the last time we were there, the owner? Offered free sake shots, very nice gesture, unfortunately I just don't like sake. My partner enjoyed it though! They even gave my toddler a shot glass with water so she can participate in the \"chin-chin\". :)"}
{"text":"As tourist of Montreal, we tried many places and Marusan performed and executed very well with their food and service. My group and I nearly got half the menu and we tried it all. It is a great choice."}
{"text":"I've heard of this counter for a while now and finally stopped by for a last minute dinner with a friend.  The place is cute, I like the decor. The staff is friendly and courteous  We took some cocktails, they were good.  We took some takoyaki to share and each a bowl of grilled eel and sashimi. Everything was arriving at different time, my cocktail was there first, so I waited for my friend's cocktail before drinking mine. Then my food arrived first so I waited again. That was the only quirky thing that happened but we didn't really mind. Apparently they ran out of the usual glass for drinks so they were searching around & I'm assuming the kitchen was a bit swamped.  I would recommend for a casual lunch or dinner before going out :)"}
{"text":"Totally awesome dinner experience here for a friend's party.  We savored a smorgasbord of small and adventurous dishes and many fine sakes.  The wait staff and owner were very friendly and offered us several rounds of complimentary shots!  You can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"First trip to Montreal and found this gem on yelp. Had TanTan for the first time and it was the perfect meal for a -12 Celsius day. We also had the bbq eel and it is was seasoned perfectly and very filling. They may say it is tapas but it is hardy size portions.  The custard dessert was light and creamy. Perfect end to the meal.  The owner will come and check on you as well. Very nice and welcoming.   Thank you for letting us dine in your restaurant."}
{"text":"Delicious Japanese food. But, when it comes to salmon-bowl kind of dishes (e.g Kaisen Donburi or their new Poke bowl), they are either stingy on the avocado or there is no avocado in it, even when advertised. At least that's what happened to me, a few times. Their prices for those dishes are around 13$-14$. Disappointed about that, otherwise, stick to the meat dishes which are delicious."}
{"text":"If you're in the area, this could be a good place to check out with friends or colleagues. Be prepared for this place to be packed during the lunch hour, so maybe you want to check it out after 1PM. The food is good, although the portions are not as generous as other places. It's pretty clean and the service is polite and helpful."}
{"text":"Just a fabulous place to eat very delicious Japanese tapas which was very well presented by warm and friendly service :-)"}
{"text":"i have been for their dinner omasake,and it was a great experience. the service was great and got to taste many different thigs in the menu and it was like 65 bux for 2 people.They had music in the background and some candles on every table,so it's great for a date.  i came here for lunch today and found the experience quite different. mostly people comin in for quick lunch. and u order at the counter. had a bowl of rice with fried pork chop and it came with a plain salad and some curry sauce on the cotlette. I found it pricey 13 bux and it didn't taste anything special.  i would recommend trying it at night time."}
{"text":"we were desapointed by the naked sushi, beef tartare and donburi which was all we ordered, we were still hungry so ordered more but were still hungry, small portion, pricy, i get there trying to be posh because the area is but the food don't march the setting.  I did appreciate the minimalist interior design and the self serve gingers."}
{"text":"Went with a group of friends over the long weekend. I ordered the katsu brie and porc belly, salmon pressed sushis, teriyaki chicken karaage and udon noodles with minced pork.  If you're a fan of fried cheese, definitely try the katsu brie as it will literally just melt in your mouth. The udon noodles were also pretty good, it had a little bit of kick to it due to the spicy oil.  What really impressed me was the staff. They were extremely accommodating even when our requests were a little out of this world. Although i didn't leave the place thinking I must come back, overall the food was pretty good.  Must have: sake and or sake bombs. I'm usually not a huge fan of sake but the sake we had was very good!"}
{"text":"Food was very tasty. Not a traditional Japanese. Try torched Mackerel and Salmon. Definitely try Chicken wings - top 5 I have ever tasted. My son had a beef tongue curry- he loved it."}
{"text":"Serves up delicious authentic don, onigiri, dorayaki, etc for lunch. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Tried this place out because it was close to my hotel. I ordered the Gyudon and the karaage. The rice could have been saucier. The chicken was juicy and flavourful. They were both delicious.   The design of the restaurant was nice, the place was very neat and clean.   The waiters were really friendly and helpful with recommendations. The service was fast ! It's a good place if you want to grab something quick to eat.   Overall, worth to visit. The price is reasonable and the quality of the food is good."}
{"text":"Perfect date night ambience at dinner time with blinds down and candles lit. Great food, great staff, great drinks. The price is super reasonable and you can taste that everything is made from fresh ingredients. The kitchen is kind of open concept so you know there's nothing shady going on behind the walls. Do the sake tasting - the owner/chef Hide knows his sake and you'll learn to fall in love with it. They also have other cool Japanese inspired drinks, like the Ippon which is a Japanese beer brewed in Quebec! On late weekend nights you'll get to jam out to Hide's awesome DJing. The place is kind of small though, so make sure to make a reservation beforehand."}
{"text":"Wow! Just had dinner at this wonderful place. It was too cold for us to wander very far from our hotel and this was close so we gave it a try. Quite honestly, if it were even colder and we were staying miles away, I'd suck it up and make the trek. Fresher than fresh food beautifully prepared and very creative. I started with torched uni with a poached egg and salmon caviar, then a green salad with a light, citrusy yuzu dressing and finally a bowl of mapo tofu ramen that I will dream about for a long time. My husband had Nagoya-style chicken wings, the same salad and a hangar steak cooked perfectly. Top that off with excellent service and a chef/owner who is so invested in his guests' satisfaction that it's impossible not to love the experience. This place is no joke. Don't miss it."}
{"text":"I had the sampler plate and it was a great way to experience a variety of their delicious food. In addition they had wonderful service and were happy to help with the menu. Overall great food and great aesthetic"}
{"text":"Review for lunch only!  It's an nice place to go for lunch, either dining in or take out. Different selection of Japanese food, from rice to sushi. Price is fair for downtown lunch at this quality. I love the curry pork tasu!"}
{"text":"Amazing Japanese cuisine from one of Montreal's top and talented chefs.  Super great vibes, an excellent place to bring anyone on a date/business meeting where you'd like to eat/drink well/impress!"}
{"text":"Yes yes yes yes and yes. This place is amazing. If your in the mood for food Japanese food you have hit the mother load of jack pots!!!"}
{"text":"We went here for a family dinner with grandparents and two kids based on Yelp review. We made a reservation in advance since our group was big (7). When we arrived, they had our table ready and the server attended us immediately. We ordered edamame right away to keep kids munching while we survey the small plate menu. The edamame came at a lightning speed and it was fresh and perfect. We had porkbelly (a big hit with everyone), 5 kinds sashimi, yaki udon, avocado salad, zhirashi sushi, and hanger steak. Every single dish was perfect. The grandparents were not used to anything other than \"salmon teriaki\" type food. Yet they loved the food. Kids devoured sashimi and zhirashi sushi. Though my kids like sushi in general, they know what is edible and what is exceptional. Marusan was exceptional. The dinner will be remembered as a highlight of our trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"My friend and I had an outstanding meal here this evening. Favorites included extremely fresh blue fin tuna shashimi and the barbecue eel with rice. Excellent, friendly service and nice ambiance made for a memorable meal."}
{"text":"J'aime bcp la decoration simple, propre et en bois. Bon service, bonnes assiettes. Je peux retourner si je suis dans le coin."}
