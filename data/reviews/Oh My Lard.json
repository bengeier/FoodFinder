{"text":"So this place has been open a couple months already? And now it's on Yelp. I couldn't help but try this after-swim summertime spot outside Alexandra Pool at Market 707 which is also the Dundas stretch east of Bathurst known as Scadding Court Community Center. Headquarters for businesses in boxes ranging from a barber to a bicycle repair guy, this experiment in street level goodness has my attention whenever I get hungry and I'm nearby. Last week it was Gushi's lovely fried chicken and this week it's Oh My Lard. Tasty barbeque is what these guys specialize in and they will leave you wanting more. We tried the pulled pork on a Jamaican coco bun and topped with a slice of pineapple, and it was delicious and substantial for $7. The other item we tried was the slightly charred corn-on-the-cob which was coated with a sauce they call Tequila Sunrise (brown sugar, cinnamon, lemon juice) and it was unbelievably good! They were sold out of burgers which is on my must-try list now, but had the caveman style beef ribs and they looked great! Try some soon! The next item I tried were the Chicken and Waffles. Wow, a Oh My Lard hit a home run with this venerable combo. This chicken was tender and juicy and the waffles, yumm! They were served with a side of watermelon and some asian-inspired syrup which was infused with hot chili peppers. A fantastic delicacy that disappeared from the plate. I liked the wooden disposable cutlery too - a nice touch! $9 for chicken plus $3 for waffles on the side. For some reason the name of this food stand was incorrectly entered as Crepes and that's where my pics went - under that name. I'll try to repost them at some point."}
{"text":"Went by this place and saw a guy Barbecueing ribs on the sidewalk. This is one of the places from the shipping containers on Dundas and Bathurst.  I was satisfied with my beef ribs but didn't blow my mind. Also was.hoping for more meat in the bones. It was good.enough though that I'll go back and try the pork ribs or a burger."}
{"text":"Aside from the huge menu there's not much to say about this scadding court market,  ecclectic stores offering a wide variety of things that are often closed most days of the week depending on the vendors schedules. Oh my lard is definitely one of the ones that has made a real statement recently and it was only now that I've been able to try them out.  Had the frito pie at it was great, and everything was just right, served quick and fresh there was no issue at all. Prices were a bit higher than I would have liked giving the serving size but that's how this collective market is, their rent is pretty high given the space they have to work with"}
