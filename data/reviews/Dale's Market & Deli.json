{"text":"I'm a frequent flyer at Dale's. I work next door and it's great for lunch. They have a hot foods section with daily specials. . Today I had the chicken paprikash, which is one of my favorites.  The fresh made cakes are very good to,  the frosting is just the right sweetness. If your looking for a special occasion cake it's great. And the fried chicken is really good as well.  Planning on using their services for my son's grad party."}
{"text":"What can't you say about Dale's.. it's one of the cleanest store's...has the friendliest worker's..fresh meat and produce..he and Debbie take great pride in this business"}
{"text":"This store is the very best convenience store in our area.  It's very clean and well organized.  The staff are always pleasant and helpful. They have a great variety of items and offer good weekly sales.  The hot food section is great!  They always offer a very good variety and all items that I've ever tried have been very tasty.  They also have a nice bakery section and offer a good selection of tasty treats for your sweet tooth.  Parking is easy to get in and out of and they will even help you out to your car with your bags - with a smile - if you ask.  And, one other thing to note:  They offer the best meat in the area...I am very selective about where I buy meat and would never hesitate to purchase meat from Dale's."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken and JoJo's picked up my order and once home found NO JOJO's. Had to go back or in the pouring rain only to be told I had to wait 10 more mins. Bad service, and refunding $7 of a $50+ order doesn't cut it!"}
{"text":"So, I actually had really good chicken tenders and jo jos from a convenience store! Everything tasted fresh! The place is clean. I wish they offered condiments other than salt and pepper. If you want BBQ sauce or ketchup, I guess you need to buy it there! I would rather get food here than another fast food place like McDonalds or Wendy's."}
{"text":"We shop here at least once a week and never had a bad experience. Everyone who works here is very nice. The store is very clean and well organized.     One thing no one else has mentioned are the amazing ribs they serve here. They only have them ( along with chicken and sides) on certain weekends. They are so good and usually sell until they are all out so get there early!"}
