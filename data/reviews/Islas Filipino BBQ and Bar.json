{"text":"From the kare kare to the Bbq dishes, everything was a crowd pleaser. Their pork and chicken sisig is by far the best sisig we've had in the city. 
Very pleasant and cozy restaurant. The servers were nice and so was the chef. It was nice being able to chit chat with him little bit more about the food. Will definitely be back to try more dishes and for more of the sisig."}
{"text":"Look forward to trying more of the menu! Offers traditional Filipino fare with a modern twist."}
{"text":"Delicious food, I have never been more excited to have a new place open up in my area.... lots of options, great prices, never disappointing... Interesting options for desserts and sides and salads... I'm finding a lot of restaurants have all the same things... this place quenches my adventurous side without the regret I usually have with ordering something new.  I'm sad I didn't go to this place sooner as it's nearby my house.  With the closing of Cardinal Rule I had been looking for a new local haunt, and this place rocks! The staff are friendly and professional, and the decor is unassumingly cool... it's awesome without trying.  I love it.   Will be visiting here more often than not! 

Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This is a new spot that just opened recently and it is the first restaurant we've ever been to serving food from the Philipines and we had a good experience.

The decor is very cool. It was about -20 and very miserable outside when we arrived here but inside it felt like spending an evening on a patio in the tropics. Also the staff were great: our server was very patient explaining all the different dishes to us and even introduced the chef! 

The food was very good and the prices were reasonable (the entrees even come with free rice refills). The empanadas really stood out as they were some of the best I've ever eaten, but the stewed chicken and the pork skewers we ordered as entrees were also delightful. 

I look forward to coming here again and trying some other menu items."}
{"text":"A great addition to the neighbourhood. So clean inside and the menu is full of interesting choices. 

The quality of ingredients and the care in preparation really comes across in the food. 

It is also a great value."}
{"text":"I'm so glad more Filipino restaurants are popping up! It truly is an up and comer in terms of cuisine. Thanks to blogto, I was able to put this place on my to-eat list. Let me start off with the ambiance. Super rustic but in a cool tone. The light fixtures and the bottom of the bar I believe were made from metal sheets. There are potpourri cups on every table, and yes, you should take a whiff. It smells awesome! There were also chalkboard writings on the wall with weekly specials.

Now for selfish reasons I would not let y'all know about their Tuesday special...but because I think for the greater yelper good, I will spill the beans. They have buck a shuck Tuesdays! Calling all oyster lovers...it is yes, a 1 dollar per oyster. I went all ham on that and ordered 12 which came with a seasoned vinegar with  a subtle kick to it. It's definitely different, oh and it also come with lemon to squeeze on it. 

Now the best part! The main dishes. I ordered the barbecued baby squid and my boyfriend ordered the barbecued kalbi ribs. They each came with a small bowl of rice. My dish was super flavorful, in fact the squid was stuffed with some ingredients I wish I asked the chef about! The sauce was a nice pesto with some cherry tomatoes on the side. I don't recommend ordering this alone as a main though because I was still hungry. Thank the day for the kalbi ribs and my boyfriend for sharing some of it. It was a sweet, charred and salty all in one flavor to the ribs. Highly recommend. I really recommend getting anything bbq, since this is technically their specialty. I would love to try their take on kamayan as well. 

The chef/owner was extremely pleasant to talk to. He came to every table and ours just to strike up a conversation. I think this restaurant definitely deserves more recognition, they have really good food, and I mean really. However, there is no website currently so I would either check out blogto's archive for a review or go on their facebook page! 

Yum, yum, yum!"}
{"text":"This is a great find. Delicious grilled meat and veggies and fruit. Amazing walnut cake. Lovely hosts, good prices."}
{"text":"The place and decor is nice. Its a clean place with good number of seats. We went for lunch here and itcwas fairly quiet around that timevon a Saturday.

We ordered the tamarind soup with salmon and kalbi beef. Both were good but the salmon was definitely better. Some dishes also come with unlimited rice, a little disappointed that it was not the garlic ricei normally get at other Filipino restaurants but it was still good.

They also do Kamayan where they lay food on the banana leaf and you eat with your hands. If you haven't tried it before, i suggest you do. It is delicious but come hungry."}
{"text":"Of all the Filipino restaurants in town that has opened up in the past 5 years, I would say this one tops it. We had the chicken adobo, pork belly kare kare, and the mix mix (aka the classic halo halo)
The wait staff were extremely professional, and were readily available to give us recommendations in great detail. The chef even came out to greet us. 

And to top it off... the prices wont break your bank account, like some of the others.

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This needs more 5 stars. It's updated Filipino food but you can still recognize it's Filipino. Good cocktails too!"}
{"text":"This is a phenomenal place! We came here for dinner and the food was the best Filipino food we have ever had.  If you are in Toronto and need a place to eat, come check this place out!

The service was on point and the environment was amazing. We came here with friends and our kids and we were all blown away by their dishes. 

We had their crispy pork springs rolls, chicken wings, tamarin soup with salmon fillet, empanadas, Kalbi Style Ribs, sea food express, and for dessert we had their walnut rum cake and halo-halo and omg, all their food is fresh and modern.  We also had some Jameson to end the night right!  

We are visiting from Los Angeles and this is by far the best restaurant/bar we went to during our stay in Toronto. 

If you are in the area, skip the rest and check this place out! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Dropped by for a late lunch and a beer. Best food in the area. Had the sisig which is a mixture of chicken and pork sizzling- and also the bar pork as a main. Delicious food, and Marc the owner is amazing. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch on our way into Toronto, food was great, atmosphere was great, service was great!"}
