{"text":"Great patties! Perfect mix of meat vs patty bread. Excellent customer service! I had the beef patty and they are all mild with a slight spice to it. Very delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is so delicious! I tried the beef patty; the filling was perfectly seasoned with a hint of spice, and the pastry was so flaky and buttery. Wonderful place to stop in for a quick snack. The owner is very kind and friendly!"}
{"text":"I was walking along Yonge Street when I stumbled upon this tiny shop selling patties. And I happen to love patties, so it was a no brainer.

I was impressed by their various offerings, but I figured on my first try I should sample their traditional beef patty. The friendly guy behind the counter, who gave me a fist bump as I was leaving, rang me up quickly and I was on my way.

It's a very tasty patty. I'll admit that at first I was a little put off by the texture of the filling (i.e. it tastes like a finely-ground slurry of meat), but the more I ate the more I enjoyed this patty. There are some bold flavors going on here and I kept discovering new tastes the more I ate.

It's barely spicy at all, though, and that's a disappointment. I think it might not be a bad idea if the proprietor offered the patty in mild and hot variations.

Still, this is quality stuff. I'm excited to try the joint's various other offerings, too."}
{"text":"My people. They found the formula.

Satisfying and delicious home-like Caribbean food, at the right price point, in a perfect location, with great customer service, fast and painless.  

I bought two patties thinking I would save one for later. It was too good to wait. The texture of the pastry was perfect - flaky and light but with substance. The filling/seasoning, a combination of 'Mmm' and 'what did they put in this?'. They have made it their own. The only other place I've appreciated the seasoning this much was at Caribbean Queen of Patties. 

Daps on the way out. Felt like I had a friend who worked there. Good vibes. Go!"}
{"text":"Best patties and coco bread I've ever had in my life and trust me I've had every brand of patty. Incredible customer service. Great location next to the eaton centre too."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this pop up shop. The woman behind the counter said they'd be there until September but if they did well, maybe longer.

Upon looking at the pictures and the name \"crumbs\" I was expecting a nice crunchy patty. The patty in all their pictures looks ultra crunchy with an egg white wash so that's what I was expecting and thought maybe that's what made them different from other patty places. However, once I got my patty, I found the pastry to be soft with no shiny egg wash like the photos seemed to have.
I chose the beef patty with cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, ketchup and mayo. As soon as I got it, the tomatoes and ketchup juice started leaking through the bag immediately. It made a huge mess which really annoyed me because I was in a rush and didn't have time to stand around attending to this. I was also only given one tiny, thin napkin was was definitely not sufficient.

I found the patty to be overall OK. the filling inside was very moist like jelly, almost like a sauce instead of minced meat ground meat. I prefer my meat to have more texture and density.

This was definitely not my favourite patty but also not the worst.  If you're a ryerson student craving a decent patty or snack then I think this is a good and affordable option."}
{"text":"Crumbs just opened and we had to try it.  We really enjoyed Crumbs beef patty.  We were going to try the Curry chicken patty but wanted to judge them on the standard beef patty first. The filling is delicious and the pastry is lighter, flakier and more moist (which I enjoy more) than their competition around the corner.  Everyone should definitely try their patties.  Next to try is definitely the Curry chicken patty.
Congratulations on the new shop!  You guys will do well here."}
