{"text":"We've come here for years and decided to try restaurant week. Little longer wait than usual (2 minutes instead of right away to be seated) because of the dinner rush hour on a long weekend during restaurant week. Boo hoo right?! lol I say it's still great service.

Place was full but our server was awesome! Super friendly and patient. I love to observe if servers treat their customers the same way and he did, super nice to all the groups. Took the time to explain the dessert options. KUDOS! 

The food? Always top notch. Cheese crisp, pizza norteña, and of course chips and AMAZING salsa. No room for all the sopapillas and to die for ice cream, but we took it home and kids devoured it.

I'm not a fan of tequila in general but the skinny margarita was strong and frozen melon margarita went really well with our meal. 2 days left for restaurant week. Go have some fun and eat wonderful food."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican food place in the area, hands down."}
{"text":"Ajo Al's is the best. The food is great every time, and the environment is super cozy. The staff is really friendly and the service is fast. Last week I picked up a catering order and they carried it out to my car for me, helped me load it, and were super friendly and nice during the whole process.

When you stop in, I recommend the chicken tacos morongo and a margarita :)"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant in the Valley, and there are a bunch of good ones here.  The atmosphere is a little schlocky but still cool.  The service is usually top notch, and the food is terrific.
My wife gets the Salad Carbon - see the previous review.  I usually get the Pollo con Cheso - a chimi-style enchilada with a spicy white cream sauce.  Heaping portions with rice and beans that actually taste good.  5 Stars."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. I only order pollo blanco enchiladas or the pollo con queso burrito. Both are always great. The service is usually meh but not bad. Good chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Have been multiple times. Always have the pollo con queso. So good. Love the chips and salsa too. Sometimes the service is iffy. The fried ice cream is a fave also. My daughter always has the chicken tenders and house salad, which she loves. She is 15 and only eats chicken tenders anywhere we go. Sigh."}
{"text":"Best Queso in town. Love burritos and the taco salad."}
{"text":"I live super close to here so I've gone along with friends when they invite me, but every time I end up regretting it. Their chips & salsa are good but I have yet to have a good meal or drink here. My friends say their margaritas suck, and the food often comes out lukewarm. The service is slow and the servers often forget things and don't check on you very often. I'll continue avoiding this place."}
{"text":"The carbon salad with jalapeño ranch is great! Service is good. Skinny margarita is awesome. We go every week and love it."}
{"text":"We've been going to Ajo Al's for over 12 years now and we have never been disappointed.   The food is great, the service is excellent the prices are very reasonable and its our home away from home.  The queso dip is our favorite and we would swim in it if they'd let us. We would highly recommend this place your next Fiesta!"}
{"text":"Great place! Went here for the first time and I'd definitely go back.  I had the nachos and boy were they big.  My peeps had pizza and burros but no one complained.  It's now gonna be on the top of my mexican food places to go."}
{"text":"LOVE their food. Their chips and salsa are always delicious and fresh. The Pollo Fundido (they call it something else, but I can't remember the name) is amazing! You have to give them a try."}
{"text":"Love this place! Jessica was my server! She made the experience wonderful! The place is super clean everyone there is nice and their food is incredible!!! Will totally be back!"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant however I don't get a chance to eat there very often because they close very early. I am sure that I'm not the only person that live up in this area that works late into the evening and would like to go out and have a good meal before heading home. Its just disappointing that they close so early. I would hope that the management would realize this and reconsider their hours of operation."}
{"text":"I struggled with this review because the food was great but the bartender was more interested in the football game and flirting with fellow staff members than she was her customers.  Pretty sure I tip you for services not your fellow servers. She made a great Bloody Mary but if the manner in which its severed is terrible, what do you say!! Be more attentive!!!"}
{"text":"Heard about this place from a local and went there the first night in town. I had combo #1 - enchilada, taco, tamale - delicious!!! As weird as it sounds, the beans were probably the best I've had. Pair dinner with yummy margaritas and you have a great experience!"}
{"text":"Disappointing.  We used to come here once a week.  They changed he red chili recipe and the beans taste like they are out of a can.  You used to be great!  Stop cutting corners."}
{"text":"Love Love Loooove this place! This is americanized Mexican food but it's the best damn americanized Mexican food I've ever had! My husband usually orders the seafood chimichangas and I always end up ordering the tacos el carbon either steak or chicken (usually steak) and the meat that comes out for this dish is always to perfectly cooked. They give you a ton of food so if you leave hungry there's noone to blame but yourself. Prices are a little higher then Garcias or other mexican chains but I will always be willing to pay for the quality of flavor you get from this place. The crew that works here is always on the ball, and always smiling. Oh and if you want fried ice cream *drooool* it's so good here and huge! Can't eat it alone... better take a friend"}
{"text":"Good ambiance, great service, comfortable enough, and the prickly pear margarita was delicious! So what gives with the two stars?

The food was abysmal! I've never had worse mole sauce. I wouldn't even call it mole sauce. It was more like \"black bean paste.\" Another member of my party had the same dish as I, and we both only ate about half and turned down the offer of the box. And I love almost everything! It was just bland, which is really bad in my book. A person orders mole because they like flavor! No one else in my party complained aloud about their food (but neither did I since I was eating for free), but I heard few compliments about anything except the wonderful margaritas. Stick with happy hour at this joint."}
{"text":"To Marty F:  this place started as a Don Pablo's, a now defunct Tex-Mex chain.  this interior hasn't changed a bit since being taken over by Al's.
We go here frequently, mainly because of the extensive menu and the large variety of street tacos.  I can actually eat here and not blow my diet with all the grilled chicken options.
Their bean dip is exceptional and their drinks are good.  We have never had a bad meal here and go about 2-3 times a month.
Things they can improve upon:  Please don't sit my husband and myself next to a party with a crying toddler.  We don't like sitting by the kitchen because there sometimes are flies (yeah, big eew on those days).  And they could stand to touch-up the paint around the booths and do some deep cleaning.  
This is a good, solid reliable place to eat that's a local chain."}
{"text":"Great tasting food! Server needs to listen better! ! When the food got to the table right it was outstanding! ! P.S. had to wait 10 minutes to be seated in a 1/2 empty restaurant."}
{"text":"4/26/2008 I went here today with a group of 8 women.  We had a lovely lunch.  We even pulled out a craft project and it felt totally comfortable.  The food was wonderful.  The staff was really easy-going and tentative considering the size of our group and our crafty nature.  :)

11/26/2011 We held our wedding rehearsal dinner at Ajo Als on the patio. It was perfect. The service was wonderful. The food was plentiful and great. The space was nice for a large group of people. We had around 40. The patio could have easily fit many more!"}
{"text":"Friends insisted on going to Ajo Al's last night.  I begged NO.  How is this place still open in this day and age of great culinary restaurants and food trucks in Scottsdale?  

They serve cheese - processed cheese.  Every plate that comes out of the kitchen comes with a warning - careful the plates are extra hot . .  burning hot filled with huge portions of tasteless beans and rice.  Next to that - regardless of what you ordered . . is covered inside and out with processed, thick, gooey cheese . . .  YUCK!  

This was the \"Mexican\" I had in the '70s in Minnesota.  No flavor - terrible, watery salsa (served in a plastic bottle).  Same menu items from 1996.

If you have no desire to actually taste the food and want to put on 5 or more pounds in one sitting - this is your place!"}
{"text":"We come to this particular Ajo ALS regularly.  We always sit in the bar area, our service is always amazing, our bartender Micayla is right on top of all her customer needs. And is an amazing multitasker! They recently put in a new margarita machine these are to die for. Although I must say she makes a mean blended one herself ! And to top it off she brings us chocolate tortilla chips with caramel sauce on them! A very nice touch!"}
{"text":"Decided to give it another try after not visting in over 5 years due to poor service.  Once again it proved I will not be back for probably another 5 years for the same reason.  Seeing as it was Memorial Day weekend there was less than four tables seated at the time we came for dinner.  We were promptly greated by the hostess and seated.  The waitress arrived a short time later and took a drink order and dinner order.  We waited about 5 minutes before the drinks arrived and then after another 5 minutes we had to ask about chips and salsa and if they still offered it as a part of the service.

The waitress essentially forgot about us and I had to constantly look around to get the attention of the staff who was having a social hour at the front desk.  Then our waitress would return and with a piss poor attitude, \"is there something you need?\"

The drinks were not refilled in a timely manner and when the food arrived the waitress said, \"careful, hot plate\" and practically threw it in front of my wife (the plate actually slide across the table a few inches!!).

The food overall was good but the piss poor service is going to kill this place!  In seeing as she had probably one table at the time to help this was completely unacceptable.  I think towards the end of the meal she realized how bad she must have been because she stopped by the table a few more times.

In closing, I feel that if I am going to spend $50 on a meal the service had better not be what I would expect to recieve at McDonalds!

** TWO STARS for the food! **

** ZERO STARS for the service! **"}
{"text":"Amazing and wonderful customer service. We ordered on Postmates and called the restaurant to confirm the order and make sure they saw the allergy issue and asked for extra chips and salsa. It was not delivered by the Postmates driver so we called back and spoke to the manager. The AMAZING manager drove the missing items to our house (himself and apologized for the inconvenience) on a Saturday night. 
This is why we should always support a LOCAL restaurant. Amazing and wonderful customer service...THANK YOU!!"}
{"text":"2/25/11: Half size pollo con queso is perfect size. Fresh warm chips are served as soon as you are seated. Bonus - it's a Pepsi place :) Took off 1 star because it took a long time for them to bring bill/cash me out"}
{"text":"I've passed this place several times and finally ate there. I've been twice now and the food is decent. The pomegranate margaritas are awesome! They have a good selection of things and are usually quick with service. It's not amazing but its been pretty good both times."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is cool and the food comes out piping hot which is nice. It's not health food almost everything is deep fried. Great cure for a hang over."}
{"text":"My husband and stepson took me there for my birthday, it was a beautiful establishment. The service was good food was great and the drinks are tasty. We had a great time."}
{"text":"I dig this place. It's the closest thing to a sure thing in the area for me as far as Mexican food is concerned. The shrimp fajitas rock, as do the fish tacos, which are made with grilled pacific Hawaiian Ono - I think they come with corn tortillas, but they'll gladly trade those out for flour if you ask nice. They also come with a super tasty chipotle cream dipping sauce, but not enough in my opinion. Ask for more, they'll bring it. For vegetarians I recommend the mushroom enchiladas blancas or the spinach enchiladas, both of which are equally delicious - and rich. Bring the Lactaid if you're lactose intolerant. Oh, and apparently they've got a killer lunch menu - not sure how I've been going there for years and didn't know that. Oh, well, maybe it's because I usually go for dinner. Margarita ordering tip: go for broke. The base margarita blows. Yeah, it's way cheaper, but it tastes like you're drinking pure sweet & sour mix. Order their top shelf, whatever it is, I don't remember, think I had one too many last time I was there."}
{"text":"I had almost given up on Mexican food in Phoenix.  I tried this place on a Friday during lunch.  I had a combo meal that included a taco and cheese enchilada.  This restaurant is one of my new favorites.  The cheese enchilda was a great choice.  Excellent flavor.

The taco was also nice and crispy, and the beef had great flavor.

The chips and salsa were very good.  The salsa was not the best I have ever had, but very good.  I wish they would put the salsa in bowls.  I cant stand eating salsa off of plates.

I will definitely return to this location.  Great food and service."}
{"text":"Great food and service for us at this Ajo Al's!  I've used them for office lunches (20+ people) and the quality, presentation and customer service have been GREAT!  They help with the set-up, bring the utensils and everything!  They can do add-on's in a cinch, within hours, and make it so easy for me to be the Office Hero.  The back patio is really big and can hold large groups also."}
{"text":"As someone who has done business valuations for other local mexican food chains such as Macayo's, Serrano's, Carolines, Carlos OBrien's, and Valle Luna, Ajo Al's seems to fall right in line with these types of family owned mexican concepts.

The families have owned and operated them for many years, some have passed them down to the next generation, but all seem to follow the same recipe and that isn't a good thing. For one, none of these businesses have invested a single dime in their locations within the last 15 years and it shows. Ajo Al's is no exception. Their decor, with the cowhide booths, old carpet and annoying table tops are outdated, dirty and simply don't work. Sure, you probably don't care if the food is good, but the smell in these places make the food taste worse and that smell is caused by old carpet.

Ajo Al's is average food. My suggestion to the owners would be to do the following:

1. Use less salt. I think I have had several heart-attacks leaving the place. Tone it down.
2. Tear out your carpet and ugly cowhide booths and remodel. It is time and you simply cannot compete without a makeover once every 7-10 years."}
{"text":"favorite Mexican in the Valley, hands down. from the red chili bowl or pollo con queso, to the basic burritos and the obligatory chips and salsa, Ajo Als never fails to fill me and my party up. something about their chicken or cheese or combo thereof sets them apart from other Mexican spots in town. 

only problem is that i always end up eating way more than anticipated.  with that in mind...for those of you who partake in a weekly \"cheat meal\" this is the perfect place to get your mind right, and has been for decades now.

pro-tip: always ask for the hot salsa when they deliver chips, 1) its amazing and 2) they serve it in a bowl rather than a carafe for easy dipping, lol."}
{"text":"The quality of their dishes varies with what you order. I have had dishes that were just Ok. But then I ordered their chicken Tacos and they were some of the best I ever had. And they didn't skimp at all on the amount of chicked stuffed into the shells. Their rice is good too. There isn't a whole lot of good mexican in Glendale. This is among the top in this area. If you want grade A mexican, you are going to have to go to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This place, hands down, is my ultimate go to for Mexican fare. As a \"reformed\" vegan, I used to believe all Mexican food was cheesy, greasy & full of lard. Ajo Al's changed that for me.. My first order was their infamous chile relleno ( I had heard about this place prior to moving here, from friends in New Mexico, Texas, even New York!) so I had to see what it's all about! Although the relleno did not come with shrimp, as I'd had hoped, for a up charge they gladly did it for me!( and didn't give me a hard time about it!!) I've been returning for years and their vast menu leaves many options for vegetarians and vegans alike. Everything on the menu, from chips to salsa, to the delicious beans and enchilada sauces, tamales are made by hand, in-house by people whose names the servers know personally. When I further inquired about the various products served here, I was elated and amazed.. They only buy from  other local az family companies! I feel good knowing my money spent here does not go to some anonymous big corporation; but to a family business. I will always recommend this spot to anyone new to the valley or people who care what they put in their bodies and the community aspect of \"keeping it local\""}
{"text":"I eat here often when in town and almost always it's good value. Usually I have carne asada burro, but tonight had cheese enchiladas in red sauce. Only three bites though. Too salty to eat. The burro is great - can't recommend the enchiladas."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today & wasn't really impressed. Ordered jalapeno bean dip for a starter & it was tasty though it seemed to take a while to get something so simple. Ordered something from the lunch menu. It was a chicken enchilada with jalapeno cheese sauce. It didn't come with much cheese sauce & the enchilada was really wet. It didn't seem like grease, more like water or something. It was just unappetizing, though the taste was alright.  Husband ordered pollo con queso which was good. One of the few reasons this review gets three stars. Decor was nice too. Oh & the bathroom was smelly. Overall, not worth another visit."}
{"text":"We decided to have lunch here on Sunday, June 26, 2016.  My husband ordered a combination of shrimp and chicken fajitas. Shrimp fajitas were $18.25.   The menu stated \"pick any two for $14.95.  Chicken fajitas were $14.25.  We figured that was a pretty good deal for an extra seventy cents!  The food was served by a guy with ridiculously long hair.  We wondered if any was in our food. I will be calling the Health Department to see if this is a violation.   When we got the bill, the server charged an extra $4 for the shrimp, so the charge was $18.99.  This was higher than the shrimp fajitas by themselves.  We mentioned  it to the server and she called over the so called Manager.  Over comes the food server with the long hair dressed like a bum.  He approached us with \"what's the problem\"?  We explained that we felt the menu didn't reflect what we were being charged.  He informed us \"listen, I don't write the menu\".  He then accused my husband of being hostile the entire time.  Neither one of us was hostile - we merely pointed out that the server should inform customers about an extra charge and the fact we were overcharged.  Knowing we weren't getting anywhere with this very unprofessional person, we said we'd just take it up with Corporate.  He said \"what do you mean Corporate - I AM CORPORATE\".  I asked if he was the General Manager and he said his brother was.  We then knew the conversation was over. When General Managers hire their unskilled relatives, this is what you get.  So, Joe, please get a haircut, dress like a Manager, not a homeless person, and most of all get some management skills.  You can't even manage your mouth. You are a disgrace to the restaurant business!!   We will never set foot in that dump again!"}
{"text":"It is good quality food, very nice facility; but how much melted cheese should one eat at one seating?"}
{"text":"We've been here about a half-dozen times at different days of the week.  Service has always been good, and food has been quite good.  Definitely one of the better chain Mexican food restaurants in the Valley."}
{"text":"We eat here often (once a month) and have done so for many years. The food served is fantastic and the service is usually above average. From time to time we get poor service but that's rare and you can tell that they are short staffed when this happens...Maybe management needs to step it up a little but the food is very consistent. I have friends from Colorado that come to town a few times a year and they always request Ajo Al's when we ask what's for dinner! I give it 5 stars as I don't think I could discredit a company that offers this caliber of food and atmosphere consistently in this affordable price range."}
{"text":"Why have I not been here before? This place is great! Had the #9, two tacos with rice and beans. The place was super empty on a Tuesday night. Not he best tacos on the planet, but compared to similar restaurants like Macayos or Manuel's this place is a solid contender."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place on a whim and oh what a mistake it was. Just about the worst Mexican food I've ever had. My chicken tacos were bland and I almost needed a magnifying glass to see them. My boyfriend's chicken enchilada tasted like something my mom would have punished me with when I was little. Service was horrible (they forgot my drink and got my boyfriend's order wrong).  All I got out of my trip there was some leftovers for my dog and a whole lot of gas."}
{"text":"There was a small mistake made with my Togo order a few weeks back but when I came into the restaurant and told the staff (Joe) at this Ajo  Al's what had happened i was almost surprised at the high level of customer service I was provided by this guy. He did everything in his power to make it right,  was incredibly gracious and apologetic and made me feel like I, as his customer was the most important part of the restaurant. I will definitely be back thanks to Joe."}
{"text":"Ajo Als Mexican Cafe has the best food in town hands down. Our family has been coming to Ajo's various locations here in Phoenix for years. The food is fresh and consistently good. The restaurants are family owned, and everyone is always friendly and helpful. 
My husband loves the tacos Miranda with its amazing chipotle cream sauce. The pollo con-queso burrito,with its jalapeño cream cheese topping, is heaven. 
If you go to The Bell Road location, ask for Alma or Diana. Both girls are fast, friendly, and always make us laugh. 
If you're looking for a good meal with a friendly atmosphere, stop by. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The decor is really unique and the service was really good. Went here for brunch and the food was really good and there was no wait."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful meal here on a Friday night. Not too busy and was seated in a quiet room in the back. I ordered the special \"candy jalapeno margarita\" to start. it was delicious and unique - it tasted like candy and then had a hint of spice as you swallowed. I ordered the combo #2, which was an enchilada, taco and rice and beans. The taco shell was warm, light and crisp....all fresh ingredients. My rice was perfectly cooked and the beans were authentic. Good service and good Mexican food."}
{"text":"I am not sure why everyone loves this place so much.   I went here many years ago and I liked it better then.   Chips were good, salsa was tasty but not very spicy.  I asked our server whether the red or green chile was spicier.  He stated the salsa was hotter than either of them.  I am glad he was honest but I was a little disappointed.  I had the spinach enchiladas which were actually quite tasty.  Wait staff was very attentive.    It's not terrible, but I like my mexican food with a little sting to it!"}
{"text":"Hadn't been here in many years. Remember them having a great pollo con queso.  Made a reservation for 6 and they stuck us in be bar with two kids. We were celebrating a birthday and being in the bar was not great. The service was AWFUL. The bartender could not maintain her tables. We sat without items often and she barely checked on us. She handed a plate to my elderly mother because she was too lazy to place it in front of her. Then as she was delivering my hot plate she was turned around talking to the table behind her and she almost spilled the whole hot plate on me!! She was clueless to her actions. 
The salsa is great but too spicy for some at the table. The food was mediocre. Pollo con queso was tasteless. Chicken had no flavor. Beans and rice were fine, nothing great nothing bad. The chicken quesadilla was soggy on the bottom and bland. Steak and chicken fajitas were bland and not very warm. The manager was surprised by our comments (the chicken tastes like it was from a can) and tried to rectify the situation. I appreciate that but it was too late. Bad service, bad food. Better off going to Taco Bell. Will never return. Surprised it's still in business."}
{"text":"So we have been here three times now. It seems even though they are busy the wait times are super short. The fajitas are amazing although the ingredient portions are not consistent with each visit. One time it's loaded with steak and the next time I'm digging through peppers to find any. My wife likes their Blanco Enchiladas and has gotten them every time we have been here. I would give a fourth star but I think the place could be a bit cleaner. It's not super filthy or anything, but it could be cleaner in my opinion."}
{"text":"Ajo Al's is one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix.  It's such a great place and has awesome food.  The carnitas are out of this world!  Say 'hi' to Danny if you get a chance."}
{"text":"This place is great.  A little pricy but the food is very good.  This is the best place for Mexican food that we have found since moving here from California in Feb."}
{"text":"AWFUL AL'S as we call it.
I am embarrassed they call this Mexican, especially when we border Mexico.
Had to meet clients there recently as they selected it, I will say they are consistent.
JW"}
{"text":"My friend and I frequent this restaurant for lunch at least once a month. Food is yummy, but we've had two instances now where the waiter didn't give back the correct change. Last time, she reported it to the manager and today it happened again. Seems like this may be a way that servers there make some extra $.  Pathetic and not sure we'll be back. If you go, make sure you use a card to pay...and check your bill."}
{"text":"Service was okay,  food was HORRIBLE though. We stopped by as hubby works construction down the street and passes by ajos everyday so were curious and wanted to try something new. I got the polo blanco enchiladas,  he got tacos del mar and DD got the kids chicken tacos.  Everyone's meal was BLAND meat had no seasoning what so ever,  i found myself drenching it in the salsa just to find it half way decent.  This place has to be the worst Mexican food I've had.  Cute atmosphere and service wasnt as bad as some reviews suggest but needless to say we will not be returning."}
{"text":"A favorite of mine. Probably the one restaurant that I've been to the most in the 10 years I've been here in Phoenix. Love the Mexican Short Stack."}
{"text":"Found this little gem by accident. It was the best accident ever! Such delicious food! So fresh and well prepared. The ambiance is perfect for a late lunch."}
{"text":"Ok, Ajo Al's is not really mexican food, but it's the best darn tex-mex you'll find in these parts.  To be fair, all Ajo Al's are not created equal.  I've eaten at the other two in Scottsdale, and this location is superior, by far.  Great food, great service, super strong margaritas, a girl couldn't ask for more.  I also appreciate their willingness to substitute on menu items.  Here I can get the pollo fundido with shredded beef, which is a big deal for me, considering I'm allergic to chicken.  If only more places were as awesome and as accommodating as Ajo Al's."}
{"text":"Loyal Customer No Longer.
Portions have been reduced at least 1/3 - 1/2 the size.  They also will not label any take out.  So if someone does not eat beef, too bad guess if it is yours.  They also insist that the order is right, just too discover with no labels they choose one meat of choice and make all items with that meat (be it chicken or beef or whatever).  This may not be much of an issue if your ordering for two people but if it is for ten it makes a huge difference. 
With Carolinas, Molinas and Carlos Obriens plus many others around I do not see me ordering from here again."}
{"text":"This is my first yelp review!  I figured I should start with one of my faves.  My family and I have been coming to Ajo Al's for as long as I can remember (and I've lived here for over 20 years).  We frequent the location in Agua Caliente, as well as the location near Via Linda Lanes.  Sometimes we choose to have dinner in the bar so we can watch whatever sports game is on tv at the time. 

Ajo Al's is amazing.  If you like spicy, make sure to ask for both the \"hot and the green salsa\" when they put chips and regular salsa on the table.  My favorite dish there is the Pollo Con Queso!! SO GOOD!  And it's big enough to split with someone because it comes with rice & beans.  Wow I need to eat lunch right now, thinking about this is making me way too hungry."}
{"text":"It's like On the Border with a bit more soul and less salt.

Family and I dined in once and took out once.  We got the chicken taco salad each time.  Comes with chips and salsa (even with takeout--nice touch!) and jalapeno ranch dressing.  You get a taco shell bowl stuffed with REAL chicken (not the processed bits you typically receive at chains), cheese, and veggies.  Tasted fresh and was very filling.  Great meal for hungry dieters (particularly if you forego the bulk of the shell)."}
{"text":"I have been going here for ever since I moved to Phoenix almost 15 years ago. What I love most is seeing a successful family business continue on among all the chains that just don't care other than the bottom dollar.  I have gotten to know the owners over the years and they are some great genuine people. 

On a typical stop here for me they already know my order unless I decide to change it up depending on my appetite.  I have a hand full of dishes that I tend to rotate thru including a chicken enchilada,  pollo con caeso, chimichanga, tacos morango, or just tacos. Making myself hungry just writing this review lol!!
Always great service every time I go. Never have to ask for a refill & always plenty of salsa's with chips!!
Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"I have always went to this location because it's right next to my house, and  have always liked the food. I went  today and the food was terrible so was the service. My food was overcooked and the chips were really hard. My husband got the wrong food and the waitress was irritated that we said anything about the mistake. We had to wait 20 minutes for them to remake the food, and no I'm sorry I screwed up the order. Will not be going back there ever! again."}
{"text":"Just ate at this shit box, Ajo Al's in Glendale. Very disappointed in our dinning experience. I wish I'd have read some of the reviews before going. The only positive I have is that the interior was aesthetically pleasing. Completely downhill from there. We ordered two margaritas, on the rocks, with two shots of Grand Marnier. It took at least 10 minutes to get our drinks and the shots of Grand Marnier were only a 1/2 oz. each. We had to request a full one oz. shot, and wait another 10 minutes for it to transpire. The food was nothing spectacular, if not overpriced. At the end of the meal we ordered two more margaritas, this time melon, and again a we waited. Our empty plates and glass wear were never cleared from the table. When we left, the remanence from everything we ordered was still on the table, and everything took exceedingly long... Do not waist your time and money if you are expecting any kind of good dining experience.
I've had better \"generic brand salsa\", and I doubt if they even know what a jalapeno is."}
{"text":"Excellent service
My girlfriend and I stopped and ate at the Ajo Al's on bell road in Glendale AZ on the first week of January.  Our server was very attentive and friendly. Great dining experience."}
{"text":"Love Ajo Al's!  The food is amazing and the employees are wonderful.  Been eating here for over 15 years. It's my go to place when I am craving Mexican food. So many choices on the menu and the food is phenomenal."}
{"text":"I made reservations for a party of 12 to celebrate my Mother's 84th birthday on Sunday, March 12 at noon. Our server was also attending other tables, after placing our order and our server confirming our order there was a long wait for our food to arrive, understanding we had a large group.  Once our food arrived, several items arrived cold and one of family members food didn't arrive, once the server was notified he apologized and said it would be right out.  As many food items were already cold we proceed with our meals and still no missing meal.  Finally the meal arrived, all other party members had finished.  I felt that some type of meal comp should have been made, as the server explained there was a mix up with another group."}
{"text":"I think this is the 4th or 5th different Ajo's I have been too. Anyway, this location is great. The Mexican pizza is just stupid good. Chips and salsa are delicious. I am not a fan of chain restaurants but Ajos has seemed to do a good job of controlling quality and they have never let us down."}
{"text":"Seems to be a typical Burrito, Chimichanga, Tostada type Mexican Food Restaurant, however, I did notice some new additions so it seems like they're trying to keep up with what else is available.  Not a lot of authentic or unique types of Mexican restaurants around North Scottsdale.  This time I opted for their Fish Taco's with Hawaiin Ono... should have known better, it tasted very much like the Chimichanga's and Tostada's and Taco's."}
{"text":"All i can review is the service because i never had a chance to try the food. Went there first thing when they opened to avoid a lunch rush.  On arrival they asked if we wanted a booth or half table/half booth.  We decided on the half booth table.  They said because we wanted the half booth/table it would be a five minute wait.  Which is not bad.  So we sat and waited to be seated.  

After about five minutes a big table arrived that needed tables put together out something to accommodate them.  The wait staff promptly addressed their seating needs and sat them.  While the greeter was occupied a couple more small tables came in and were promptly seated.  We noticed that they were seating all these people ahead of us.  We were just a party of two.  We immediately told the greeter that we would take any table that would get us seated.  

I think she realized she had been seating people and forgot about us.  Instead of addressing the problem she advised us that regardless of table or the half option we would still have to wait about five minutes. 

Since we had already been sitting a while and saw multiple tables seated we decided that we would go next door to Mimi's.

I will not be back.  The greeter clearly lacked the ability to prioritize and work front of house."}
{"text":"What a joke! I ordered a taco salad and was given a salad with no taco. They said this was their version. BS. I have received a taco in my taco salad before at this location. Service was horrible."}
{"text":"This is my go to Mexican food joint for chicken fajitas.  Today was no exception for lunch.  Place was not crowded at all... there other locations seem to be a lot busier (at least for lunch).  This one is a little out of the way compared to the others as well.

Chips were fresh and there salsa is awesome.  Just enough heat to go with a great flavor...  went through 2 bottles of it!

Service was good and the price was just about for other Mexican food places in the area.

One of the better margaritas in the valley as well.  So good on a Sunday afternoon!"}
{"text":"Ajo Al's is a pretty solid Mexican restaurant for Phoenix.  All of the traditional favorites that you're used to ordering are well executed.  The staff are friendly and helpful.  The margaritas are tasty.  Check out the tacos morango or the queso dip."}
{"text":"A bunch of us go to dinner on Friday nights in the West Valley.  Last night / 4/8/2011 we went to Ajo Al's and had a great time and meal.  Thanks go to Isreal our waiter who was always attentive, there, helpful and a good sense of humor.  We will return."}
{"text":"My favorite mexican restaurant in Phoenix, hands down. Family owned, they are always friendly and love their regulars. I have not had a bad meal there and especially recommend the Pollo con Queso ... and the fajitas ... and the shrimp tacos ... Suffice to say, I've never had a bad meal there."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for our first time and were not disappointed! The only negative thing I have to say is the chips were a little too greasy.  Amazing beans and rice and so much flavor in the steak fajita! The cheese enchilada was the best I've ever had and of course we got a fried ice cream! Amazing! 2 thumbs up for Ajo Al's!"}
{"text":"This place is a bit like stepping into a time machine and going back to the early 80's.

The decor is kitschy, and not in a fun way. The Tex-Mex themed dining area is designed to be comfortable, but is definitely aimed to please simple folk in lower income brackets. Tableware and accoutrements are of the sort used in cafeterias.

To be fair, service was top-notch and the restaurant was spotlessly clean.

My two star rating is mainly for the food. Very little on the menu is vegetarian. Many bean items contain lard. Anyone on a vegetarian diet, or trying to eat healthy will have problems finding anything to eat here.

Most dishes appear to be old-school Tex-Mex classics like one would have found at a Texas beanery in the 1960's. There is nothing modern or innovative on the menu. 

Sorry, but, the culinary world has moved on to bigger and better adventures. Most of us left this sort of food behind decades ago. If you have older relatives looking for simple, old-school, lard-filled Tex-Mex this is the place to go. Otherwise, prepare to be seriously chagrined."}
{"text":"Their portion sizes are enormous.  I was part of a party of six and we ordered their nachos as an appetizer. Those nachos alone could have served as the meal. Nice selection of excellent flavored margaritas. Their chicken enchiladas were tasty, including the red sauce, which was moderately spicy. Their sopapillas are the highlight of the menu. Not since living in New Mexico have I had such fresh and fluffy sopapillas. Pass on the option to have them served with ice cream or sugar. Have them served plain and then drizzle them with honey. It's makes for a great dessert. Another highlight is Ajo Al's Southwestern ambiance, which provides for a nice, relaxed atmosphere. This is a great place for dinner with family or friends."}
{"text":"Very disappointed,  I've been going to ajo al's for at least 6-7 years now for their ugly enchilada which was what got me to go there in the 1 st place when it was featured in the AZ republic newspaper.  I just tried to order it to go and was told it was a specially item and they are out of mole so I could not order it.   Wow,  they just lost a loyal customer for life and a walking advertisement which I once was.   Didn't seem like they cared either"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Highly recommend the steak fajitas. Large potions and non-stop chips and salsa! (They also have a spicier salsa that is amazing)"}
{"text":"I have been eating her for over 20 years.   moved to California and every time we come back for a visit  Ajos is a must stop for us.   we usually end up taking extra orders of the queso back to Cali with us. nom nom nom"}

{"text":"Just ordered food for everyone at my home through Doordash and I can tell you this food was a complete disaster. The food is unbelievably overpriced, the flavor is bland and worse than food at fast food joints, and they don't even describe the items right at all. Cinnamon sugar sopapillas are supposed to have cinnamon sugar on them, but these are just slightly sweet bread puffs with a sprinkle of powdered sugar. And they are $5!? I have also never had a bad chimichanga until today, and it was REALLY bad. What a pathetic excuse for Mexican food, I can't believe they are still in business."}
{"text":"Clean atmosphere, slow service. Really turned off by the guy that brought our food super long hair, no hair net, but a cute beret."}
{"text":"Fantastic place. Great food, great service. The jalapeño bean dip is the best around. Happy hour has some awesome deals. The Scottsdale location is better than the west side restaurant. But i may be biased."}
{"text":"We tried this place on a recent trip to Scottsdale and found it to be a real mixed bag.  Our server was very accommodating and nice.  The food was a mix: kid's burger and fries were fine, cheese enchilada was not what we had hoped for, but the tacos were very good (smoked carnitas, pickled onions, cilantro, smokey salsa).  Free chips, hot from the fryer, were great, but the salsa was too mild."}
{"text":"At first I thought the parking was horrible until I saw also the parking located at the rear of the building!  Upon arrival we were greeted warmly and seated promptly.  Our waitress came by quickly to take our drink order and we also ordered queso dip.  This was very good and encouraged to to eat more chips (see below!).

I ordered the skinny margarita which I did not care for. It definitely did not taste like a \"fresh\" margarita so needless to say I didn't order another one.

Their tortilla chips are house made and come to the table warm...yummy! The salsa was good but a few too many chunks of pepper for my taste. But that being said we went through many chips (read 'we ate way too many') and a couple bowls of salsa!

I ordered the folded quesadilla with fajita steak. This is an appetizer so no accompaniments but I still had some to take home because of all the chips I ate!  The steak was well cooked and had a good taste.

We also ordered the Blanco something or other with mushrooms, the trio of tacos (brisket, pulled pork and carnita) and the pollo con queso. All were delicious.

Our waitress was friendly and supplied our never ending want for more chips!  We could have had our water container filled more often but I guess we could have asked too.

It was pretty quiet while we were there on a Saturday, late afternoon.  Not sure if we'd return because hubby said he likes another restaurants pollo con queso better but it might be worth a try simply for the chips!"}
{"text":"My review is from an experience I had with this restaurant about a year ago but I still think about it and have not returned to this restaurant because of my experience so I though I should share it with others.   
My husband and I decided to order \"take out\" because after a long day, neither one of us wanted to cook.  We ran down the list of our usual take out places and agreed that Ajo Al's sounded good.  I placed the order for our dinners and my husband went to pick them up.  The problem began when he returned to our house.   He only had his order, not mine.  I called the restaurant and explained to the women who answered the phone what had happened and she said I would need to speak to the manager.  After a brief hold, the manager picked up and I told him that we were missing part of our order. He apologized and said that he was the one to blame because he forgot to put it in our bag.  He said that they had it ready and that I could come get it.  I told him that I was not happy about this situation and that I would come get my dinner but that I also wanted our order completely redone so that both of our meals would be hot at the same time and we could eat together as we had planned.  The manager told me without any hesitation and with great conviction that he would not redo my husband's meal because there was nothing wrong with it.   He just wasn't going to do that even though he had made the error which created the problem in the first place.  I argued with him that it was not that big a deal for him to make the entire order over and it would be very poor customer service if he did not do this especially since now we had to make another trip to the restaurant because of his mistake.   As things were, my husband either ate his meal alone while it was hot or waited for me to get back with mine by which time his meal was cold.   All I wanted was to have a nice dinner with my husband.  
We have never been back and do not plan ever to go back to this restuarant again.  They treated us very poorly.  Think twice before you order take out or at least be sure you have what you are expecting before you leave!"}
{"text":"After a year of lamenting that Phoenix's Mexican Food scene is nowhere near the caliber of Southern Cal's (where I moved from), my husband and I are done with searching and lamenting! It is just so yummy. I am a creature of habit and get the Pollo Con Queso every time, and I highly recommend it. It's huge, so luckily it tastes exactly as good re-heated the next day. Maybe even better. If there was anything that could improve, the milder salsa is served in a mini carafe that has to get poured onto your chips directly, which can get messy. But it's really no big deal. And they'd probably give me a little bowl if i asked, I just never have. Do yourself a favor and give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Oh so Yummy! Letter E lunch special!  I've been going to Al's for YEARS now.  They have some of the BEST Tex-Mex food anywhere!  Their chicken has *ALWAYS* been very moist and tasty.  I highly recommend trying them out!"}
{"text":"Drove all the way from Gilbert to this place because of the good reviews and that the presidents go here. Was very disappointed in the food. Chips and salsa were not great and the food was just edible. Ordered everything from burritos to fajitas to the steak salad. The steak was hard and overcooked and the food was over salted. On the Border makes better food than this place. Never again. The chicken also is like a rotisserie chicken. Gross."}
{"text":"My wife felt like tacos but didn't want to go too far...we should have trekked on!  I was just accompanying her for company and maybe a margie for myself! ;p. We pull up, get out of our vehicle and make our approach to the door when we are smacked in the face with a horrible sewer smell, made me sick.  We mad our way thru it and as we approached the hostess we went by the bar and the bar had that wet bar order smell ANOTHER unappetizing smell...think this would have told us to get out while we still could, we stayed.  We were quickly approached by Mandy to see if there was anything she could bring my wife ordered a strawberry margarita frozen and I ordered a cadillac margarita no salt and VERY light ice...it arrived more than half filled with ice and served in a BEER glass!!!  I have NEVER been served a margarita in a beer glass before!  My wife's came without sugar on rim and was not sweet in the LEAST!   Mine was sooooo sour I had to eat some tums just after I finished it.  My wife ordered food and she said it was OK and she was very pleased with the service she received from Mandy, I was upset about all the ice.  Personally I won't be back there are way too many other place that listen to me when I order, I have very sensitive teeth and cannot take cold drinks at all."}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food, great service and a nice atmosphere.  I have eaten at two of their locations, on Shea Blvd. in Scottsdale and on Bell Rd. in Peoria over the years and have been very pleased at both locations.  My favorite is shredded beef burro enchilada style and, although their portions might have shrunk a little bit, they are perfect.  There are many Mexican restaurants to choose from.  My first choice is Ajo Al's."}
{"text":"Food is nothing special. The salsa comes in a jar with chips and your expected to eat the salsa off your plate rather than a bowl(crappy). For Mexican food i would say Rio cafe or el pollo loco is better."}
{"text":"First let me start by saying I have been here many times, however not for breakfast until this time. 
This time was special, I had one of the best breakfasts I have had in a restaurant in months. 
The eggs Benedict with chorizo was fantastic!!
The eggs were poached perfectly, the chorizo was tender and flavorful without being greasy. The hollandaise sauce was smooth and creamy. The portion size was very generous and left me more than satisfied. John the manager, Eric the bartender, and Daniel the busboy  were on point and I never had to ask for a thing."}
{"text":"I've been going to Ajo Al's for at least twenty years so it pains me to say that the quality of the food has gone way down hill in the last few months. I'm not sure if there's a new owner or what the issue is but it's gotten bad. Real bad. (How do you screw up a cheese enchilada?) 

I still love the location, service and the fantastic atmosphere but I can't recommend the food anymore."}
{"text":"Ordered DoorDash. Got the pollo con queso. Apparently their \"pride and joy\". It was super salty and so were the refried beans. Chicken was dry. Would not order again. The chips on the side were okay but the salsa was weak af."}
{"text":"Been to this location a handful of times. Prompt service although the last time I was here, the floor and table were sticky. The green chile tamale had good flavor, was moist and creamy. The shredded beef taco could have had the meat drained better but the flavor was good. Love their chips and salsa. When we were there Randy Johnson, the famous D'backs pitcher was dining in the restaurant as well."}
{"text":"This was a new place suggested by a co-worker.  I was told it was tex mex more than mexican.  The  place looks great with lots of room. 

Pro- appears to be clean,  friendly service and great ambiance.  The menu has many choices and thenhappy hour prices are fair. Rice & beans we well flavored without tons of salt. 

Con- my Pollo Blanco Enchilada was really gross. The sauce wmtasted like canned queso cheese and the chicken was overcooker with no flavor.  The salsa on the table was average. 

I suggest you go to try for yourself though please stay away from the pollo blanco Enchilada- no bueno."}
{"text":"Great Fajitas and fried ice cream. But it's challenging to have conversations with the people you come with. But we love the place :)"}
{"text":"Pollo con Queso is the best. It's extremely filling but so worth the calories. I always get it NOT deep fried. Chips are made fresh and they have a yummy spicy salsa. Kind of pricey so I typically only go during lunch. They have great specials."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is always great. Cadillac Margaritas never disappoint. Wasn't too thrilled to order desert at 9:55 and be told that they close in 5 minutes, so we cancelled our desert order. That said, we'll still return. We love it here."}
{"text":"I loved this place! Great service and food. We ordered half an order of nachos which was huge and then two entrees. Our waitress was amazing and she was serving half the restaurant! We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wow! Great service and food is amazing, plate comes hot, but food comes hotter! Yum!

Mushroom enchiladas with Steak, hibiscus margarita, great dips!"}
{"text":"I like this place but it is a little over priced. The food is good and pretty authentic and i had good service but it wasn't anything amazing. I got a margarita and it was STRONG, which I liked. Loved the chips and salsa. It is walking distance from my house which is convenient but i don't know if i will be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"i got to the hotel late and I was looking for a quick bite.  This place had decent review so I gave it a try.  It was getting close to the closing time so I was the only customer.  I ordered the chicken fajita.  The chips were fine nothing memorable.  Salsa needed some extra zip.  I asked for a hot sauce and I got two different ones.  They were great.  Even though I was the only customer, it took them a while for my dish to come out.  It had the usual vegetables.  Flavor was fine but it was too greasy.  I know it's supposed to be, so I usually have an open mind but this was even greasy by Mexican restaurant standard.  Overall, it was satisfying but I can't understand all the rave reviews.  I've had similar stuff back in Iowa.  I expected much better."}
{"text":"Have eaten here many times with the inlaws. Is fancier than the original location on 90th St,  food is the same (always good), service may be a tad better."}
{"text":"Great place! The salsa is so good I eat too much of it every time. Pollo con Queso was so good too. Anything that has a pound of cream cheese on it is right by me."}
{"text":"So, so Mexican food. Went for lunch and the food was quick but quality lacking. Cheese tasted a bit off and my wife did not eat her tostada. Service was a little to hands off. Plenty of Mexican restaurants to go to, I would not recommend this one. Sorry."}
{"text":"Service was great! Food was yummy and hot. Good place to hang out with family. I will come back my husband enjoyed the chicken chimi. I had the shortb stack,  and my son had the shrimp tacos. We all left satisfied and full ;)"}
{"text":"Ohh boy. Very tasty but I feel pretty gross right now. Sooo rich. I split two things:

1) pollos con quests. Extremely tasty. Lots of cheese and tasty cream.

2) beef chimichanga. Fairly good. Soft outside with some sauce. Not my kind of chimi but good."}
{"text":"Terrible service. My husband placed a to go order and asked for water. They treated him as if he we homeless and asked him to wait by the door for his food. We come here often and have never been treated this way.  Definitely NOT a happy customer."}
{"text":"I had to take a star away. I ordered take out, everything cool, they told me 15-25 mins. I waited with anticipation for my food to be ready at my home and super excited to get my food. I got there about 30 mins later and they didn't have my order. I showed them the number I called and remember the name \"Ryan\" who took my order. They just didnt push my order through which is OK, mistakes happen.  As someone who works in the food industry though, I have high standards for customer service so I didn't appreciate having to wait 20 more mins for my food. I would of been more happy if they gave me a free dessert or something lol. I mean that's what I would of offered. Oh well, even places like AA can't be perfect."}
{"text":"We love visiting Ajo Al's every time we visit Arizona. The food is delicious.  The service is excellent."}
{"text":"I have been to the Ajo Al's in Glendale, but have only eaten the Pizza Nortena (AMAZING!) but went to the one on 16th st and Camelback and was less then pleased with, not only the service we DIDN'T get, but the food was no bueno. 
Chips and salsa came immediately. Water was already on the table in a pitcher melting and sweating away, making for a not-so-pleasant mess to stick one's arm in. Salsa was blah-no flavor at all. Chips were good, but, they are chips...
After sitting for 20 minutes waiting to order (two other tables sat after us, ordered and were eating already) Ordered the steak fajitas without any sides and no tortiallas. Fajitas came, with sides (what a waste) that I didnt ask for, and the fajitas were chicken, NOT the steak I had ordered, and to top it all off, they were burnt on the bottom, and continued to burn as they sizzled on the skillet they bring them on. (smokey burnt smelly mess in my opinion) Definitely won't be going back to this location ever again. Hopefully my experience isn't valley wide and I will have better luck at the Glendale one, IF I go back."}
{"text":"We had a big party that went out for Mother's Day, the restaurant was clean and seated us promptly. We even had to modify our reservation and they were very quick to adapt to the change. Our waitress made sure to keep lots of chips and salsa on our table (the kids were going through them fast). There was enough (but not a lot) of selections on the menu. The foodoffered was served hot, fresh, and tasty. Our waitress was attentive. Many members of our group had a number of modifications to their orders and she got everything right. We were happy with the experience and would definitely return."}
{"text":"Walked in this place for lunch and it was almost empty (Red Flag). I sat at the bar. It had a nice mexican style to it with plenty of stools.  The house margarita was big and it was actually pretty good for a pre-mix...the food was NOT GOOD.  The chips were stale with no salt.  The salsa tasted bland and out of a can.  The chicken chimichanga was filled with dry, unseasoned shredded chicken and the steak in the fajitas also lacked much flavor.  The bartender was very nice at least!"}
{"text":"My family and I have always love Ajo Al's on camelback they are great! Good food and good service. Recently we visited the arrowhead location and had to worst experience. Terrible service, terrible food and we waited forever for a bill. Definetly visit the camelback location and forget about the arrowhead location. Just my 2 cents!"}
{"text":"Love this place, great staff have been waiting on us for years. I look forward to coming in at least once a week for some fajitas, margaritas and catch up with friends.  After walking all of IKEA, great way to wind down on Friday."}
{"text":"Amazing food for everyone.. Vegetarian to meat lovers.. This place has it all!  Including Mimosa's.. indoor outdoor seating.  Lots of ambiance!"}
{"text":"my friend and i went to ajo al's tonight w a groupon and it wasn't even worth it w that!!! i eat mexican food all the time andi have to say it's the worst i ever had...i had a chicken salad and the chicken was gross and there were cooked onions on it.....blah!!! who the f does that? salads are supposed to come w raw onions, not slimy cooked ones.....oh and the waitress left alot to be desired too...she spilled my glass of iced tea on me and acted like it was no big deal!! she was horrible and weird and this was a horrible experience all the way around...i am surprised they are still in business since they serve shit!!! gross!! i will never, ever go back to this shit-hole again!!!"}
{"text":"Slow service and messed up orders.   I don't know if they didn't expect the crowd they had...."}
{"text":"Extremely solid contender in the Mexican food market place! Lived here for 12 years, passed this place many times, and just tried it out yesterday. Cheese dip was really great, as well as both of our entrees. Service was nearly perfect as well. Place is really colorful and well kept on the inside. It's slightly overpriced, but maybe that's why reviews are consistent over the years... You get what you pay for in life. Will be going back."}
{"text":"Our family loves this place - great food, great drinks, friendly service.  Chicken is my favorite protein there.  Skip the sopapillas.  ;)"}
{"text":"We came in for lunch, wanted to try something new.  Food was good and the staff was friendly.  Got our lunch quickly. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Loved there food went here for the first time after church with some friends and we had a great time. Probably stayed in the booth to long so we left a good tip."}
{"text":"Awesome food, more authentic than anywhere else. The mushroom enchiladas and carne asada tacos are fantastic.  Try the polo fundido as well"}
{"text":"Hard to find, but worth the search. Had the chile relleno taco plate. Switched out the tamale for a chicken enchilada. The only disappointment was that this combo didn't come with rice & beans. Margarita was excellent. Victoria was attentive & friendly. Salsa could have had more zip. Chips ample & crisp."}
{"text":"Our first time yesterday. We were looking for a good margarita ( I am picky picky about margaritas) with ambience and good appetizers and we found it! I loved the atmosphere the nachos and cheese crisp. The staff was excellent, really cared if we were satisfied. Oh almost forgot to mention the comfy bar chairs. We will definitely be going back for a full dinner. We even asked about having a large group, they said no problem."}
{"text":"What an experience! After going to this establishment for 15 years  it has officially hit rock bottom.
Drinks:  Warm Beer, Margeritas devoid of tequila.  Asked for a cold glass took 10 minutes to get it to me.
Beans: pinto DRY, Black beans under-cooked and cold
Rice:  No taste and under cooked
Burritos:  Chicken inside was excellent. 
Decor:  OLD and needs a redo and cheesy.
Workers:  Mostly teenagers with no management. 
Prices: Cheap but that's all its worth
Summary:  Its day has come and gone!"}
{"text":"I got the steak burrito with rice and beans. It was very poor quality meat, and the beans and rice were very bland. Their salsa and guacamole were the only somewhat positives. I spent $19 on my meal, when I felt I could have had much better at Taco Bell for much cheaper."}
{"text":"OK I hated it! I have eaten Mexican food all across North America and this is by far the worst! Seriously I would prefer to eat at Taco Bell than return here!
 
The building is all they have going for them. 

Service is mediocre. If you read the menu you will see at the bottom that they will not split checks for a table and a few other will not rules! Come on people, how tacky and inhospitable can a eatery be!? My waitress was some young girl. She was okay but obviously not to experienced. 

My food, left me dumb founded! I was having lunch. I ordered the steak fajita $11. It was a big meal with rice, beans, guacamole, Pico de Gallo, the fajita had lots of colorful peppers w/ onions and mushrooms! Never have I had mushrooms in a meat fajita, but okay I'll go with it. Then I bit into something that set my mouth a blaze! But beyond all that the food was SALTY! Yes the rice and beans as well! I could not eat it. I set there contemplating my hunger, what set before on the plates and the girth of my waist size, or to doggy bag it for my hound - I was ready to walk away when the waitress showed up and noticed my plate. When presented with the idea of a to go box, I broke down and told her it was to salty. She kindly offered to get me something else. Off the top of my head I said a chicken enchilada. It came out, and it was even worst! When asked if it was to my pleasing, I told a bold face lie! I said it was better, only meaning it was not as salty. Then I asked for a small sour cream, to cover the taste up in an attempt to make it look like I had eaten more of it then I intended. I picked at it but left more than half of it on the plate along with the sour cream (2 Tablespoons) that they charged me $2 for! 
I wanted a Sangria but opt not to attempt that recipe after experiencing the kitchen's recipes. Besides $7 for a glass of Sangria was a bit steep in my mind as well. 

If you know me, you will soon learn I love a happy hour. I read their happy hour brochure and was not impressed. Basically half price on chips & two different dips and $5 drink specials. I'll pass on this as well. 

Wild horses, horny handsome straight men, nor hunger or thirst will get me to return to Ajo Al's or recommend it. 

Oh and it's not cheap for lunch nor dinner either, considering it's Mexican food and awful. Sure glad my Uncle Al could cook better than this."}
{"text":"The three tacos and some rice were seriously overpriced. Take a look at the tacos - they are one corn tortilla with limited amounts of stuff on them. The chipotle cream sauce was the highlight of the $13 ripoff and to add insult to injury it was taco Tuesday. This company needs to get with the times and offer some better discounts on Tuesday. The salsa in the jar thing has always been a dumb idea because you end up pouring all the salsa water on your chips. We also had a two cheese enchilada dish and for $14, this was another taking advantage of their North Scottsdale location pricing. Nothing special and the green sauce was ladeled on too heavy. Each dish would have been perfect at $10, but quality and prices means that I will try another Mexican joint next time."}
{"text":"Food is wonderful and priced very reasonably.  Tamale, cheese enchilada and taco were all very good. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"I drive part time for Uber eats and I have picked up food from this place many times. They popped up on restaurant week this fall l, I figured let's give it a shot.  The restaurant week menu was done very nicely and it included 2 drinks.  I see why I pick up a lot of orders for delivery from here, the food is food. It is very much an Americanized Mexican food restaurant  (lots of cheese and sour cream), but it is tasty. Large portions, great flavors, and fast service.  The drawback is the atmosphere, it is a clean environment , just blah inside the bar has a couple of tv's but with not a lot of good angles.  The bench seating at the tables are not comfortable at all . It feels like a place that you need to eat fast and get out,  it is not conducive for hanging out at all. But hey get the food to go and it will be fine."}

{"text":"I've been enjoying the food and ambiance here for about a year. I usually come for lunch with friends. I have yet to have any negative experiences. The food is succulent, tasty and fresh. Service is stupendous and fun. The ambiance is enjoyable and puts you in the mood for a great time with family or friends.

I give this restaurant a solid 5 stars!"}
{"text":"We came here  at 10 am for \"bottomless\" mimosas for breakfast. We were advised this special lasted until 2:30pm. We were then told we were \"cutoff\" at 12:30pm for absolutely no reason. Are checks were brought to us shortly after without even being asked.

{"text":"From the other reviews I had read I was expecting below-average from this place and was pleasantly surprised. The service was fine and the food was pretty darned tasty. Bravo Ajo Al's for exceeding my expectations."}
{"text":"Great sized portions and reasonable prices! I frequently get the chicken taco salad with the jalapeno ranch. It's one of their lunch specials and it is amazing! I love coming to ajo al's or picking up food to go."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, love this place!  Really enjoy the changes they have made to presentation."}
{"text":"I have been going to Ajo Al's since I was knee-high to a grasshopper. It was my dad's absolutely favorite place, so we went there a lot. It was a nice place where you could dress up, be served well and enjoy wonderful food. It was incredible. It has been about a year since my last visit to this particular location. My husband and I visited tonight- here are some key highlights about our experience.
1. When we walked through the front door we were greeted by a kid who meandered up to the host podium in skinny jeans, vans, and an aqua tee. Moments later I learned he worked there, and that the uniform has changed to tee's with artwork on them. They look cool, but not for the caliber of the restaurant this was. 
2. This kid pointed to a booth and said- \"There is a table right there for you.\" All while standing at the podium. Ummm, okay. Hello. Right where? Should I just walk around the restaurant and point to a table, and you holler yes when I find the right one? Do you want me to grab my menus from you too? How about you take us to the table and seat us. They even do that at Denny's, come on-being a host is not rocket science. 
3. We were seated at a booth at the bar- this one he had pointed to. The restaurant was fairly empty and the bartender was on her break. They called her in from her smoke break to serve us- I didn't realize she was an employee at first. When we were walking up to the restaurant, she was sitting on the back patio smoking and watching videos/a show/something on her cell phone. 
4. When she finally did come attend to us, she walked right up to our table, put her phone in her pocket, and asked us what we would like to drink. However, when she put her phone in her pocket, it continued to play whatever she was watching. Loudly. Instead of excusing herself and reaching in her pocket to turn it off- she kept talking to us, ignoring it- like it wasn't there/wasn't her. That makes for good customer service.
5. People here were sloppy. The most presentable people were the bus boy and the guy who delivered our food from the kitchen- and this man is the only respectable employee I saw the whole night. 
6. Our salsa was watery. Salsa here used to be the BEST. We would fight over it and eagerly wait for refills. This time, our tomatoes stayed in one spot and the water/sauce ran all over our plates. Disappointing to say the least.
7. Portions were large like they have always been- at least that was consistent.
8. I ordered the Green- chili, chicken nachos that were entirely bland. My chicken was dry and flavorless, the jalapenos were dried out, and it surprisingly did not have a single green chili. Hmmm. No wonder it was so bland. I didn't bother complaining, as I assumed I would get just as great customer service as I already had. Little did I know- this bland food was to make me sick all night... food poisoning at it's finest. Funny- the last time my husband and I were here, he got food poisoning. 
9. We were all set and waiting for the check. No one acknowledged us. I stacked our dishes and pushed them to the side of the table to make the table easier to bus. I hoped that would be a sign to them. Our waitress was still oblivious. The awesome employee- the kitchen guy- when he was delivering food, he had noticed us and returned to take our dishes and check on us. He then brought our check upon our request. If only we were tipping him instead of our waitress. 
10. A man who had never addressed us picked up our check without a word. 
11. We left and were not addressed at all. Kbye. 

Needless to say, we will not be returning. We will also be passing this message on to our families and friends, to keep them from having such a lovely experience themselves.

Save your wallet, your time, your stomach, and your dignity, and FIND A DIFFERENT PLACE TO GO OUT TO EAT."}
{"text":"We have been going to Ajo Al's for about 8 yrs. We have been to 2 locations, this location on Bell Rd has been the location we have go to the most. We went on Sun, March 12, to have a birthday lunch for my Mother. We have made reservations in advance as we had a party of 12 people. We were very disappointed with the service we received. Daniel our server took our order and then before he left the table repeated every ones order back. It took a very long time to get our food, it was lukewarm when we got it. We had order a Cadillac Margarita and it didn't look or taste like what we normally ordered. Ask the server about it and his response was \" different bar people make it different. He didn't offer to take it back. My daughter's lunch did not come out with the rest of the food, when we asked about he said oh I will go get it now. He came back out to wait on other tables and we asked again about her meal and he again said oh I will get that now. Everyone tried to wait so we could all eat together but our food was not very hot in the first place so we ate and her food finally arrived. He said there was a mixup in the kitchen and some other table got her food. After that he pretty much ignored us and when I asked if I could speak to a manager he just walked away. I am not sure if Daniel was having a bad day or if this is how the employees are told to act."}
{"text":"Conveniently located. They have a large patio area for private use . The food was average . Salsa was ok . They were understaffed  but very friendly  and helpful  portions  are large but a little  pricey"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years.  Love the mellow vibe of sitting in the bar, sports is on super low volume and nice place to just hang out and relax with a quiet conversation.  Food is pretty good, won't knock your socks off or anything, but okay.  Lately, I think they have reduced their portion size and raised their prices, although I can't confirm that it just seems that is what they are doing.  Which is fine, not trying to pig out or anything, but then again, most people like a great bargain (and perhaps some leftovers for street tacos in the morning - if you are like me anyway).  

I did want to add something.  I think I have talked about this before, but not sure.  Their cheese queso dip is the BEST IN THE VALLEY and you WILL NOT BEAT IT.  Recently, they started servicing sonoran hot dogs (awwww yeaaah, you know that's Attorney Steve's weak spot).  But anyhow, instead of ordering the hot dog their way, order it PLAIN with a bowl of the queso cheese sauce.  Then, when your dog comes, dip it into the cheese sauce with each bite.  If that is not the best thing you have ever had, respond to me on yelp telling me ATTORNEY STEVE YOU ARE A TOTAL MORON!!  I will deal with it if you do.  But yeah, that is DA BOMB sonoran dog.  

That being said, I always speak my mind.  The hot dog bun itself is a bit dry.  I really think they should serve those wrapped in aluminum to keep the bun soft and fresh. Also, ARE YOU KIDDING ME $9.99 FOR THE DOG ARE YTOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?  

Anyway, we always go back, but based on their pricing schemes we are not regulars.  Still a great place to drop in, but that's a once every other month deal for me.   Keep in mind, if you have business clients, it is still a good place to take them.  Easy parking, good service, etc.  

Have fun, and find your sizzle!

{"text":"Ajo Al's is pretty cool! The atmosphere is nice and the service was wonderful. Our food came out quickly and was really good. The portion sizes are enormous, far too big for any of us to finish! We all enjoyed our food, but I was told the beef is not worth getting again. I will definitely be back for the guacamole tacos!"}
{"text":"Had you asked me to write the review after my first visit I would have given three stars.  Now that we have been back for a second stop, it has dropped to a 2 star experience. 

Biggest plus - the chips are hot fresh and the salsas are tasty.

However, the entress are just a soupy mess of sauce, beans, rice and whatever you ordered.  It seems they plate the food, then throw it under a broiler or heat lamp to perfectly melt everything into one congealed mess.  Flavor is jsut ok, as the two stars say, \"meh, I've experienced better.\"

Still on the quest for a better upscale Mexican Dinning experience.  Somewhere where they rice and beans are not one big mess covered in sauce and sour cream.  Somewhere where they take the time to plate a nice plate of food."}
{"text":"Restaurant looked very clean, and had a nice artsy decor. I also liked the restaurant didn't have blaring music playing so you can actually talk without screaming with the people you're dinning with,unlike other Mexican sit down places. I went for lunch and ordered off the lunch menu which had a good selection at a good price.  Service was fast and the food was good.  It was nice not to have to wait on the weekend to get seated around lunchtime."}
{"text":"The happy hour drink and food specials are great.  The prices outside of happy hour, however, are too high for the quality of the food.  The salsa has little flavor and the chips are in desperate need of additional salt.  The mini chimis and queso were delicious, but the full size chicken chimi with red sauce was a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"My husband and I go here when we want Mexican food and we love it. Great people and friendly service."}
{"text":"tl;dr: Poor service, bland food, waste of time + money during Fall Restaurant week.  We will not return.

Full Review:
This is on a Sunday around 2pm.  Not many people seated or at the bar when we walk in.
* Barely greeted at the door
* Told we could sit \"there\" *points to nearby booth\".  This booth was clean but had the completed check of another on it.  So when I clarified, he was like \"Yeah, that one is fine\".  My husband has to pick up the black check holder and hand it to him to take away \"Oh, sorry\".
* Table setting has 3 glasses of water, 2 silverware settings.  This is the table my family of four is seated at....
* There are no Restaurant Week (RW) menus.  I have to go back up to the greeter and he goes \"Oh yeah, sorry\" and grabs them.  Seriously?
* Waitress comes to take our order.  I ask her if the margarita's on the RW menus can be swapped out for a beer.  She replies \"Sure, I don't even care anymore\".  Wow...SERIOUSLY..?  BTW, my husband declines and just goes with the 'rita on the menu...
* She doesn't take drink orders for our girls.  This isn't corrected for about 15-20 mins...
* Salsa and chips are places out.  We only have two plates.  No one comes back around for us to get more until our appetizer comes out...and it was the man who brought our food out who was nice enough to do so!
* LONG waits between seeing the waitress as she is also solo running the bar.  Joy...
* Food comes out and is just barely \"OK\".  Literally, my kids didn't eat their fries because they weren't good.  Kids not eating fries.  Wow.  My husband and I's tacos range from just ok (Asada taco) to bland and tasteless (fish taco).
* We have to flag down our waitress to even try and order the last course (dessert).  We opt to take it to go because lunch has taken an hour and has not been a positive experience at all.  We got the sopapillas and split one in four before hitting the road...  Just meh.  Ended up tossing them when we got home.

The good news is that they are another joint off the list.  With all of the great local spots in the valley, we won't even think about wasting our time and money here again."}
{"text":"What can I say?  Been coming here since they first opened in the late 80's.  Best chicken fajitas anywhere!!  Great salsa & chips.  Their  taco salad is outstanding.  This has been a favorite place for my family for years.  My 2 grandsons are 22 & 20 and they still say their favorite thing is Ajo Al's pollo con queso"}
{"text":"I had heard of Ajo Al's, but never been there. I was staying overnight in a hotel within walking distance and decided to try it out. I made it over for happy hour and was pleasantly surprised. I was able to order an appetizer and 2 house margaritas for $10.50. Both the food and drinks were good, especially for the price. Nothing seemed spectacular, just standard Americanized Mexican food, but the happy hour pricing was definitely worth while.
I sat at the bar, and the service was wonderful. Bree was alone in the bar and was hustling nonstop. She had a lot of customers, plus the restaurant drinks, but everyone received plenty of attention. She was a huge plus to the experience. I look forward to coming back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Took the wifey there for her first time and it was nothing short of spectacular as usual. My co-workers and I eat there frequently and I kept telling my wife that I was going to take her there. The waitress was super nice, the food was absolutely amazing, and the first time experience for my wife was awesome. We will for sure be going back and taking the kiddos next time. You won't be disappointed when you eat at this place."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service sucked. We went on a Friday night so it was busy, but still, we sat for 10 minutes before even being approached and we waited at least 15 trying to track down the waitress to get the check. Waitress was very pleasant though."}
{"text":"Things have changed here. The quality of the service and food is way below what we expect from this restaurant. First time I thought we just had a bad night but the second time I have to believe something has changed. I can't say I'm not disappointed. Time to find a New Mexican restaurant in the area. Any suggestions?"}
{"text":"Ajo Als on 16th Street es no bueno, my girlfriend and her brother got food poisoning from here yesterday! that's just gross!"}
{"text":"Started with chips, and the salsa was very good. Had a nice little chilly kick to it plus a hint of garlic which was absolutely perfectly balanced. I ordered the skinny margarita, a Chile relleno, tamale, and brisket street tacos. The chili relleno came with both red sauce and green sauce on the side, and I have to tell you, the red sauce was very very tasty. The green sauce was just as excellent, with a welcoming hint of lime which made it super delish. One thing that I really liked about the tamale was that there was a ton of meat and only a very thin layer of Masa... Look at the pics! It was very tasty as well. The meat was buttery and toasty and very good. When I first looked at the brisket tacos, I thought there may be too much corn for my liking, but the complementary Taste of sweet and savory was amazing. The GM told me that they smoke it for almost 4 hours before they start putting it on the tacos and you could tell. Amazing flavor, and probably my favorite tacos that I've eaten including some of the other places that I've given five stars.  Finally, the skinny margarita was made super well, no mix whatsoever and a great choice of Tequilas to choose from! Overall, just a great experience with a really great authentic Mexican environment and very friendly staff. No reason not to give these guys 5 stars! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This has been our neighborhood go-to restaurant when we want something predicable--great drinks, delicious and filling food, and friendly service. Ajo Al's has never let us down. Love the tacos Miranda & the skinny margaritas for something a little on the lighter side."}
{"text":"Sadly disappointed.  I 'll start with the chips, they were deep fried in what tasted like OLD oil,. They had a burnt,  rancid taste to them. The salsa came to the table in a small carafe, not a bowl.  Had to pour salsa onto each chip. They provide a plate,  but it's a little hard to dip a chip into salsa on a plate.  I ordered a dinner salad, the lettuce was not fresh. It tasted like bagged salad. I ordered a chicken taco and enchiladas.  They put a ton of the chicken  but the chicken tasted like canned chicken, very salty, and inedible. The cheese they used was not fresh cheese, Tasted like Pre-shredded bag cheese without taste and bad consistency. Not even sure if it was real cheese. The only thing that was good was our server, bless her heart for having to work there .                                      I strongly do not recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"This is one of our family's favorite Mexican restaurants. We go every chance we can. We all love the jalepeno cream sauce \"white sauce\". It's unique to Ajo als and I definitely recommend it! We used to live in Arizona and love to get our \"Arizona Mexican\" food fix every time we come. The ambiance is nice and they have a great happy hour menu. Casual but art deco Western I'd say with very comfortable booths. Thank you for hosting us over the years!"}
{"text":"First off, I love this kind of Mexican food.  The kind that is covered in cheese and so unbelievably unhealthy that I shudder to think what the caloric content is.  I swear AZ has it's own brand of Mexican food.  When I lived in L.A., there was no way I was finding a deep fried burrito covered in jalapeno cream cheese and then topped with more cheese or a Mexican pizza with that same jalapeno cream cheese used as a sauce.   Ajo Al's does have lighter options and their Salad Carbon is favorite of mine as well, but sometimes I just need to indulge. 

You should know something else.  I worked here as a hostess when I was a senior in high school.  So, I had the opportunity to try a ridiculous amount of Ajo Al's food.  I still love this place and always will.  If you're like me and you love the Sonoran style food served in places like Julio G's and Valle Luna, you'll like Ajo Al's too.  

You should also know that I don't understand when people say this type of food is not authentic.  Authentic to what?  I sure can't find this crap in California, New Mexico, or Texas; all of which border Mexico.  So, it must be authentic to Arizona, right?  And that is what I love, good ol' AZ Mexican food."}
{"text":"I have to say that I have never met a friendlier staff. I spoke to a manager named Joe and he was absolutely delightful. He recommended I try the pollo con queso and he nailed it. If you are looking for a great dining experience in Glendale you should definitely try Ajo Als!"}
{"text":"Okay food. If you go at lunch, prepare to wait a long time for your food. If you have the time, the chicken fajitas are pretty good (although it's like pulling teeth if you want more than two tortillas for a huge plate of veggies and a couple chunks of meat)."}
{"text":"first impression? the couch in the waiting area is filthy and there's no hostess to be found. 

we sat down and received chips and two salsa. we also received two cups and a pitcher of water and then the nice lady walked away. i guess we pour our own water? ok.  not gonna lie, it was kinda messy. we pretty much sucked at trying to pour water. haha

everything on the menu was around $15 which was a bit shocking considering the no greeting, the self serve water and the dirty couch in the lobby.  i guess the feeling i got from the place i was expecting it would be closer to $10 menu items? 

our waiter came out quickly and he was the only waiter on the floor. he did surprisingly well. i never felt like we were lacking when it came to needing something. 

my steak fajitas were super tasty-  they let the veggies get crispy and there's nothing worse than soggy veggies. the tortillas were amazing. and overall i was happy with my dinner. it was huge so that $15 plate did stretch for a few meals and it really was worth it because the quality is there for sure (i'm leaving out my complaint about the brownish quac and pale pico de gallo bc i didn't eat them and the fajitas were great on their own)

it was definitely a good choice for dinner. it was a decent family owned restaurant.

i just wish the rest of the experience was relevant to the price of the food. the food is worth the price but the rest was a bit off for me. 

in the end- after tip it ended up being about $20 per person. i would probably go again if i was in the area and needing some good mexican food. other than that, probably not. it was a-ok and if they upped the rest of the experience i would most definitely be a fan!"}
{"text":"Vegetarians beware- All sauces are made with chicken stock, even on the mushroom enchilada which is described as vegetarian. (Neither the rice nor refried beans are vegetarian either.  They did have a black bean option, but no rice option.)  They were able to accommodate by just using cheese, no sauce.

Service was pretty good."}
{"text":"Ate lunch at Ajo Al's for the first time on recommendation of friends. We were not disappointed. Seated quickly and loaded up on tasty salsa and warm chips made in-house. Our server Juan did an excellent job answering our menu questions. Pleasantly surprised by the large amount of food we received from the lunch menu. All dishes were very delicious and fresh. We will be back. Sincerely, Karen & Art (Karts) Huseonica, Sun City"}
{"text":"Amazing! Love this place and make it a point to come every time I'm in town. Great kids menu that consists of more than Mac and cheese. Highly suggest the pollo con queso....it's amazingly delicious but a lot to eat! Highly recommend and will return!!"}
{"text":"Well, it's about time I got around to writing a review of my favorite neighborhood mexican restaurant.  Within about a minute you'll get fresh chips and salsa and Cadillac Margaritas, if you like.  Some of the best enchiladas I've ever had are my usual, and fresh jalapenos (not pickled) are readily available if you're a wee bit more daring.

Sit at the bar and enjoy a new HDTV screen and watch some football; special tip after those jalapenos: head over to your favorite gelato place ;)"}
{"text":"My husband and I travel from San Diego to Sedona to see family and thought we'd found the perfect place to stop on our way home for lunch.  Initially really enjoyed the décor, the super high ceilings, glass art, and neon.  The booths are comfortable and the food is pretty good.  Not great, but good enough to keep us coming back, and maybe giving all the different menu items a try to see if there are some stand-outs.  But the deal killer is the wait staff. We've had 3 experiences now, and each time, the waitresses have been indifferent and clearly not interested in providing a good customer experience.  The last time we went, Easter Sunday, I asked if there was a special Easter menu.  She just said \"no\".  I asked about the cheese dip and asked if I could sample it before we decided to pay for a whole order of it.  She said no, the portions are automatically poured into servings.  Seriously?  I asked if there was a champagne brunch offering, again, nope.  At least they sold splits of champagne, but it wasn't mentioned, I had to ask.  We had Huevos Rancheros (weak on flavor and way too soupy and wet) and carne asada tacos (pretty good).  Why are the salsas served in glass bottles, with no dish?  We will be using Yelp to find another Mexican restaurant in Glendale or Phoenix."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch today.  First interaction was with the hostess.  Smiled, grabbed menus, said follow me,  then literally dropped the menus on a table and kept walking.  Never said another word to us.  Actually didn't even look at us,  literally dropped the menus and just kept walking.  Seemed a bit rude. 

Other than that the rest of the experience was nice.  Our server was attentive and the food was very good and filling.  The cheese crisp with guacamole yummy.  The chicken short stack extremely good.  

We are looking forward to taking the in-laws here when they come into town.  



3-11-13

We came back for lunch today after some shopping at the mall.  We were excited for the Cheese Crisp.  We were disappointed.  The other food we ordered was mediocre at best.  

The waitress was not pleasant.  No pleases,  no thank you's, no real personality to speak of especially in the food service/customer service industry.  

Not sure if there is new ownership here but it went down hill.  Seemed to be a bunch of teens working here without any adult supervision.  Not worth the drive from our house in Buckeye if this is the experience that $50 with tip is going to cost us."}
{"text":"Clean, no wait and plenty of parking but that's where the positive stopped. Service was insultingly slow, food was  luke warm and ooverly sally...won't be back.."}
{"text":"Pretty good Mexican food - for Arizona. I take eastern visitors to a location near our office and they think it is authentic. I guess it is Sonoran style while I favor the good stuff in New Mexico"}
{"text":"By far my favorite Mexican place in the valley!  It has the safe, welcoming feeling of a big restaurant but the taste of authentic Mexican"}

{"text":"Went here for lunch today.  The chips and salsa were terrible.  I ordered the steak fajitas.  The meat was good, but the veggies were burnt beyond recognition.  Good service.  Too expensive for quality of food.  I'd rather go to Macayos or Filibertos."}
{"text":"I will start by saying great food and amazing salsa... However worst service and slowest wait staff I've ever encountered. It's not even busy in here. I ordered a beer literally 20 min ago and still haven't gotten it. Also the salsa is brought in a lil carafe and nothing to poor it in. Very odd and puts the patron in a difficult situation to figure out."}
{"text":"What a shame this place has gone into the toilet.  Firat i ordered eggs and the homemade chorizo.  5 mi utes later the waitress came back to say they forgot to tell her there was no chorizo.  It was homemade.  Then my daughter ordered the shrimp fajitas.  The shrimp were not cleaned properly.  Disgusting.  They offered to remake it and that took anither 20 minutes.  Beans were bad.  Clearly they are canned.  Rice tasted old too.  Avoid at all cost."}
{"text":"Love their shreaded beef burro and wonderful chips and salsa wonderful employees great environment"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Phoenix/Scottsdale and would be best in Arizona if it were not for Mi Nidito (Tucson).  I'd give them a tie."}
{"text":"A year later, I'm back at Ajo Al's and still like it just as much as last time.  It's a little heavy on the salt, but whatever.   The steak Chuy's Chimi was awesome, not overcooked.  The waitress made sure to let me know it's covered in green sauce, and substituting red wasn't a problem.  

The service was great - never had to ask for a refill, the chip bowl never went empty.

Delicious, reliable, what more do you want?"}
{"text":"Ajo Al's, I don't know why I keep coming back to you. Perhaps it's because I've eaten at the 90th Street location since I was a pre-teen. I've had good experiences and horrible; guess this is a trait at all Al's locations.

This is the second time that I've visited this location, last time being a year ago and the food was ok. This time the food was mas o menos. We ordered Sangria, however, the sangria served was unlike any other I've had. The server told us it consisted of watermelon juice, brandy and he couldn't remember what else. No wine in sangria? Hmm... Anyways, the appetizer of guacamole was great with a lot of garlic and lime to it; the entrees, at least mine, was downright nasty. I ordered the Garden Fajitas light oil, to be served Garden Fajitas swimming in oil. So much oil I think that by consuming my entree it might serve as a laxative as well as a meal. I didn't eat the fajitas, or the rice because I'm sure it contained chicken broth. On the bright side the Mushroom Enchilada I had was good. Now I know why I visit Al's on an annual basis, if that."}
{"text":"I'd like to give this place zero stars, but that is not an option. I used to go here and like it, until about a month ago when I went in on a weekend day for lunch and got a nasty surprise. 

I ordered my usual - shredded beef tacos.  I took one of the two home as I can never finish all my food.  Later I went to eat the other one for dinner and when biting down, bit into a rock hard \"something\" that cracked my tooth.  I spit it out, put it in a bag and went back to the restaurant to complain.  My server and an Asst Mgr looked at it and determined it was a piece of bone that came from a mistake a cook made while shaving meat off the bone.

I was promised the owner would contact me to discuss the situation and my injury.  Days passed and nothing. I went back in person again - was again promised a phone call.  Days passed and nothing.  I called a few days later and was told the same thing over the phone.  Days passed and well you get it by now - nothing!  I went in person one last time to tell the person at the hostess stand that I was disgusted by how I was being treated.  

She told me the owner was out of town now for several weeks.  I told her that almost everyone has a cell phone and if he cared even a little for how a patron of his restaurant was impacted by the food I was served, he'd find a way to get off his ass and call me.  She just looked at me. 

This place should be SHUT DOWN immediately. Food safety and customer safety is obviously of no concern here.  Eating here is at your own risk.  

Mr. wonderful owner will be hearing from me soon - when I sue him in small claims court.  Had he been a decent human being, we could have resolved this so much easier."}
{"text":"I have gone here a couple of times and was impressed with the food enough to go back.  This place serves your usual Mexican-American style food but does not go over the top on portions like some other  restaurants of the same genre.  The chicken I had was moist and well seasoned white meat.  I also tasted some of the steak from my boyfriend's burrito and it also had a good flavor.  The house margaritas are good, the salsa is tasty and the service was pleasant and our waitress apologized for neglecting us a bit because she had a 12 top in her section.  I would definitely go back here to try the Pollo Con Queso as my boyfriend's Mom said it was delicious."}
{"text":"Although there are many options for Mexican food around the area, I prefer going to Ajo Al's.  Amazing chips, salsa and guacamole."}
{"text":"I was there with a group of about 12 for a birthday. I've always had marginal service and food at Ajo Al's, so I wasn't that thrilled.  I just ordered something that they couldn't screw up, and it was OK. Here's the problem; I  found a hair in my food. Some of the folks that I were with would have made a scene, so  I just picked it out and had some more chips. 

That night, they had a full house and the service was marginal again. Everything too fooooorrrreeeeevvvveeerrrrr!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner and catching up with my bff.  The chips were hot and fresh and the salsa was flavorful without burning.  Our dinners were good.  I liked the guac that came with my beef flatuas.  The beans were good and the rice was super good after I put some salsa on it.  A very solid dinner spot for sure."}
{"text":"Delicioso!  I came here for lunch and was impressed with the selection, service, and of course the food.  The queso dip was out of this world.  No Velveeta here!  I love that you get a whole little bottle of salsa so you never run out.  The Pollo con Queso (ordered 'not deep fried' by my friend) was amazing.  The mushroom enchilada, rice, and beans were also great.  I definitely want to come back and try some more stuff like the tamales and chile rellenos.  The service was excellent too.  Welcome, Ajo Al's, to my regular rotation - I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"I've driven by this place so many times and never stopped in, but was glad we checked it out yesterday.  The atmosphere is quite nice, the service was ok, but the food was tasty.  I thoroughly enjoyed my mushroom enchiladas...yummy and the lunch portion was just the right size!  Beware...the food comes out piping hot and takes a long time to cool down.  The chips and salsa were really good too."}
{"text":"The food was decent. It isn't a place I wouldn't go out of my way to return to, however it was a standard Mexican spot with pretty good food. 

The service was great and the food came up quick. The salsa was good and the chips were endless which is always a great thing to have at a Mexican spot. I just wasn't blown away by anything. Nothing stood out as above average."}
{"text":"Have had lunch here several times as this is one of my co-workers favorite places. It's your typical Mexican fare, not bad, sort of greasy, average to slightly above average. Parking is good, the facilities are clean and they have a large bar."}
{"text":"I've visited this location a few times before. Usually end up going once a year. It's hard to find amazing Mexican restaurants in the area, but this one is okay. 

I've always gotten the Pollo Con Queso and it's pretty good. Portions are huge and moderate pricing. The servers are always upbeat and friendly, and the restaurant never seem to be extremely busy so you are well taken care of. 

Would not be in any rush to visit again, but give it a try if you are craving Mexican food."}
{"text":"We wanted to try a local restaurant so we went with some friends we were visiting.  We had reservations so getting a table Friday night was easy.  The salsa is so weak.  Lacked flavor & spice.  Luckily a local we were with knew about a green sauce/paste that was kinda spicy that we mixed in with the table salsa.  Finally the manager brought be a different red salsa/sauce that had some bite.  A combo of all 3 made a semi decent salsa.  I had a chicken burrito with a delicious sour cream sauce & cheese. Really tasty.  I'd go again & order the same.  If the salsa was better I'd have given 4 stars."}
{"text":"Not a bad place.... It is defiantly more tex-mex than authentic... but they have Mexican beer, margaritas and is in a good location."}
{"text":"Can't find a dish as wonderful as house special cheese covered in the red sauce anywhere in California :-) send me the recipe"}
{"text":"Food was good, but service wasn't comparable.
The alcoholic drinks took a long time and the margarita was too thick (hadn't melted the entire time we were there), then the Bloody Mary was \"eh\" & I never got my extra olives. Seemed like they were under-staffed for the lunch crowd. No one appeared happy; they were polite, but not much enthusiasm. 
Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Went for dinner here on a Friday night. Had a bit of confusion to start the evening (the hostess forgot about us) but the manager comped our appetizer for being forgotten I'm the lounge. We had the jalapeño bean dip. Thought it would be spicier but still delicious. Next I had Tacos carbon. Very tasty and well prepared. Wife had a combo plate and she liked it has well. All in all, a solid visit. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome great food friendly staff the only bad thing is it's kind of a small building need more space but food is amazing 3 kinds of salsa highly recommend"}
{"text":"We were seated right away... No wait... Yay! Greeted with a friendly smile and our drink order was taken immediately!! Margarita arrived... I ordered a strawberry one with sugar..not too good ... not sweet at all... our server Mandy was great and very accommodating asking if she could get me something else and explaining they don't use fruit puree but use real stawberries so the sweetness is less. .  Nice music in the background... the restaurant is open and decorated nice... nothing fancy to write about just nice. It seemed forever before we got out food.... ... I was starving! But the food was really great. Cheese  enchiladas,  tacos and burros...all basic foods but yummy... would recommend using margarita glasses rather than beer glasses for Margaritas.  Otherwise...Happy overall. A little above 3 stars not quite four..."}
{"text":"Best chips and salsa for miles.  Great service -  friendly.  The pollo con queso is always a fave to share. When in the mood for a salad, I love any of them with the jalapeño ranch dressing.  They have Angry Orchard... Makes me happy when there's a good hard cider in the house."}
{"text":"This restaurant is our favorite Mexican restaurant in the West Valley to date.  My boss brought me my first time, and I had to bring my husband the next.  We both love Mexican, but ever since moving to AZ, the only great Mexican place we found was in Sedona.  Not anymore!!

Let's just say the portions are huge.  We started out with nachos (a half order, since I could only imagine the size) and we both nearly died when they came out with the dish.  I actually asked the server if it was a half order!  They were hot, delicious, and had an abundance of toppings.

My husband ordered a chicken burrito with the traditional sides, and I got the spinach enchiladas.  Both were cooked perfectly.  We both had leftovers and lunch for the next day.  We never made it to the fried ice cream... but left very happy with our meals!"}
{"text":"Service was pretty subpar. We walked in early on a Sunday afternoon. There was no hostess and the women that was tending bar looked straight at us several times in the 5 min we stood there but never once acknowledged us. Finally someone came and seated us. Food was ok it wasn't amazing and we most likely would have occasionally gone back if we didn't feel the service was so bad. Also they ended up turning on the ceiling fans half way through our meal and we got a nice little shower of dust from them. They could use a little dusting on all the knock knacks and statues etc."}
{"text":"We've been going here for about six years now.  We go there a lot.  The new menu IS ABSOLUTELY AWFUL but I'm not going to rate them badly for a poorly designed menu.  The food is great.  My favorite is the Green Chili Pork Burrito.  My wife usually gets either the Green Chili Quesadilla or the Spinach Enchilada.  We both got a taco salad this time.  C'mon though Ajo Al's - have pity on the Baby Boomers who can't even read your chaotic menu."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Mexican restaurant.

Try the blanco enchiladas with spinach, chicken, AND mushrooms.  You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Great place to eat.  I took my wife there on 12/26.  It was a little loud but what do you expect on the Friday after Christmas.  The service wasn't fast but was efficient.  The food was great!  I had the cheese enchiladas and  my wife ordered the mushroom cheese enchiladas.  Oh, and the chips and salsa was amazing!  We live in central Phoenix and never realized there was an Ajo Al's near bye.  I know what we're having for lunch today."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican Restaurants..  Been coming here before I even moved here in 1989. All food is great and must start with con queso dip. Also one of the best happy hours with 3.00 margaritas and discounted apps!  Give them a try! We come at least once a week!"}
{"text":"Good experience unfortunately marred by not honoring our original reservation. 

I must say first that the food was very good and our waiter was excellent and friendly. Kudos to him. But we had a family reunion planned and reserved the semi-private room in the back. We called in again later to confirm that we would get that room. But when we arrived tonight, we found that they had already given the room to a different group. No one at Ajo Al's bothered to call and tell us this. Had we known, we would have gone somewhere else with our big group of kids, adults, and seniors. Since we were such a big group and had to sit in the main room with all the noise and being very spread out, we didn't get to interact as much as we would have liked. We made it work, but we are very disappointed that the management let this happen."}
{"text":"Good for lunch but be warned the portions are large.
I asked the waiter what the place is known for and she recommended the Pollo Blanco.  Good call on her part but I could only eat half.  It was had a mild spice/heat and nice jalapeño cream sauce. I would order it again.
The chips and salsa are good but if you like more flavor in your salsa just ask! We did and she brought us a stronger and thicker batch which beat the initial watery offering. we gobbled that version up and she kept bringing more!
The service was perfect for a fast lunch, attentive, quick, and our iced teas were constantly refilled. We wanted for nothing, well, after we asked for the better salsa that is!"}
{"text":"They have great salsa and fundito sauce! Their carne asada burrito was also very good and would eat again. Their chips were stale which was very disappointing as we ordered to-go so I could not ask for new chips and could not enjoy the great salsa."}
{"text":"Ajo's, you never disappoint! I happily chose Ajo Al's for my Mother's Day lunch and am so happy I did! I don't live close to your locations anymore so I don't get to enjoy my favorite tacos on earth as often as I'd like. We had amazing service from the nicest waitress and lunch was a highlight of my special day!"}
{"text":"I went there for lunch not too long ago and the service was lacking, rarely saw our waitress after we ordered. 

The food is always amazing, but you get that at any Ajo Al's.

Pollio Con Queso is always the best."}
{"text":"Solid.  Pollo con queso, shrimp fajitas, and carnitas tacos.  Everyone enjoyed their meals.  The chips and salsa were great.  Great service.  What more can you ask for.   Looking forward to a return trip and try some of their other items.  Thumps AND forks up!"}
{"text":"Solid, seriously good AZ Mexican food!  Many of the staff have been working here for years and are excellent.  It is family owned.  Can't go wrong here with the food or margaritas."}
{"text":"Chicken Flautas and Mini Chimi's from the happy hour menu were fabulous."}
{"text":"Food was okay, I probably wouldn't come back for it, maybe to try the tacos. We were with a big group, however I've never had worst service. After only ordering 1 drink the entire dinner, with no refills on water, I finally went up to the waitress who was flirting with a group of guys at their table (now I know where she was all night), and I asked her for a glass of wine and out check. No joke, she brought my wine 18 minutes after she dropped off the bill...

Good atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Very good as always.  The Pizza Norteña is always way too big and way too delicious!! One of my favorite Mexican chains!"}
{"text":"So....I have to say....I have actually been avoiding this place for years.  I mean when I think Mexican Food, I usually avoid touristy names like the plague.  THANK YOU RESTAURANT WEEK and my friend Tim. 

This is one of my new favorite places.  Good location and GREAT FOOD.  The Mexican pizza is my favorite, but you better be hungry!!  The only issue I have had is with service.  Our first server didn't decide it was important to tell us that the menu was per couple not per person.  We spent double the money required and had WAY TO MUCH FOOD.  Not overly convenient when you are headed out for the night after.  The second server was just not very attentive.  All in all good place and I will be back."}
{"text":"Disappointing! Friends have told me how great food is here. I had the beef chimichanga and it was soo salty! I couldn't finish my food. I ended up filling up on chips and salsa. The food wasn't even worth taking a picture of."}
{"text":"ok food cool interior and nice server will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"This is a family owned and operated restaurant. We started with golden margaritas they arrived and almost tasted good but it was like drinking half water and half drink.   I didn't care for either salsa, one was smooth tomato puree that was just very hot and the other fresh tomato one was very watery and smooth with barely any flavor like the margaritas.

I ORDERED a grilled CHICKEN salad. As my luck would have it the waiter presents me with a grilled BEEF salad. I didn't say anything and just accepted it. The salad really was OK with grilled mushrooms and some onions the beef was OK but not seasoned. I was afraid to use the dressing that came with it because it was bubbling a bit.

My husband had a platter with steak, sauce, onions, fresh roasted jalapeño and cheese all melted up with rice and beans, he said it was good. 

We got good and not so good.

2.5 stars"}
{"text":"Okay I may be a tad biased, for as long as I have be living here in Arizona- 16 years- this has been a fantastic treat for my family and I. (Granted I have only been legal for a few months) Always having a casual close spot has been a haven for everything from quick meals to special events (just had a fabulous birthday dinner there) with fantastic fried food and a friendly wait staff. WARNING: if you want to have a healthy meal, this might not be the place to go. I mean the healthiest option is the salad carbon but you can never resist their amazing chips and salsa which will always leaving you bloated (as well as very satisfied) as you walk out the door.

When you walk into the restaurant you are greeted by the cute kitchy decor that always puts me in the mood for a fabulous meal. I mean who 
hates cute little cowboy hat light fixtures and cow hide seating: people with no souls, that's who. I mean it always makes me smile when I see the old western movie posters and the charm that you don't find in restaurants anymore- cute without the overly chainy feel.

This place for lunch is fast, you can be in and out of this place in a half and hour! That's what I call service! If you want my recommendation, order the pollo con queso, its just some nice little chicken burros, covered in melted cheese and for the grand finale globed with spicy cream cheese. I mean what's better than that, nothing.  

Maybe it's the ooey gooey comfort food covered in cheese, artery clogging guacamole goodness that I need once in a while. Maybe its the sweet, regular staff that always greets me and seems to know what I order. Or maybe its the fact that my recent diagnosis of gluten intolerance has not impeded my meal here at all- I can still feel evil eating delicious food without actually getting sick... um WIN?! Whatever it is, no matter what anyone says this place will always have a special place in my heart and will never lose it's spot as the best mexican food in town."}
{"text":"I really hate giving bad reviews, and not often give 1 stars. But I would give even just a 1/2 is I could. We came in with a large party with reservations. They didn't have our table set up and had no idea where to put 4 kids. It was strange to me. The hostess was beyond rude as if we were inconveniencing her. We started placing the high chairs out and was abruptly told they couldn't go there, okay well then you set them up (which they should have been in the first place with a reservation). I moved on and was ready to enjoy the meal. Our food came and it was disgusting. My husband got a chicken quesadilla, the food was soggy and watery. How can you mess up a quesadilla at a Mexican restaurant? I ordered chicken nuggets for my kids, they were out. Really? Out? I had the spinach enchiladas which I've had in the past there and liked, well not this round. They were cold and can tell the spinach was frozen and not fresh. We left disgusted. We won't be going back that's for sure as they have gone down hill tremendously. Service and Decent Food is what we at least expect, and they failed. It's unfortunate but people need to read what to expect."}
{"text":"The food here is kind of pricey but you get what you pay for. I love the chips and salsa here but I don't get why they serve their chips and salsa in weird containers that make it hard to eat. It's so frustrating! They also serve you your food piping hot so make sure to let it sit for a minute or else you are going to burn your mouth. Other than that the servings are big and the food is great."}
{"text":"Great food. My husband took me for a late lunch at 1:30 and the place was empty so we had awesome service.  Fresh chips, hot and mild salsa and my husband's favorite the jalapeño ranch. I had the Carne Asada burro Dinner with beef. And it was packed with beef. My husband had the lunch E which was the Paco Pollo Con Queso  (Chicken and cheese) very good. So we spilt each in half and enjoyed."}
{"text":"BUYER BEWARE, UPCHARGED ORDERED WITHOUT DISCLOSURE.

 $21 for a chimi and lemonade.
 Really?! 

Ordered the $10 chimichanga lunch special and asked if it came with carne asada. The waitress responded with \"we have steak\" which sounded great. No mention of $6 upcharge. Sneaky, very sneaky. Bill for one chimi and lemonade was $20.24, add 10% tip for Ms Sneaky pants and im out $22.24. Wow, Ripoff! First and last time here

UPDATE: Management contacted me, admitted it was wrong - sounds to me like they have not trained their staff, a serious management issue."}
{"text":"I'm going solid 4 stars, but with a caveat....:)

The chips were hot and crispy - 4.5 stars.
The \"hot\"salsa was nicely done - 4.5 stars.
The \"green\" salsa was one of the best I've had - 5 stars.

The show-buster which gets 6 stars is the \"Spicy Chicken Soup.\"  I read the review of this soup in the New Times 2007 \"Best Of...\" and have to agree that it's one of the better chicken soups around .

Perfectly salted (meaning not overly salty) and with the right amount of pepper.  Nice big chunks of obviously 100% \"REAL\" chicken breast (no fillers, nothing fake about it ) and zucchini and whole baby carrots.  Sprinkled with a touch of corn and rice and small slivers of onion.

Very tasty combo of flavors. Hits the spot on a cold 50 degree day.

The caveat?

My other friend had the lunch combo with a taco and a cheese enchilada, refried beans and rice.  Absolutely nothing special or very tasty about any of the stuff on his plate.  Bland.  Boring.  Cheap-looking and cheap-tasting.

So if you are in the mood for some good, decently flavored chicken soup, and some above-average chips and salsa, give it a try.

If you're gonna order a combo meal, I'd say take your business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Average Mexican food, chips and salsa. Fast on lunch menu service. Chicken Chimichanga was decent, added red sauce."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this restaurant for years, I like just about all of their food. I usually order Cheese enchiladas, and shredded beef tacos. Their cheese enchiladas are good but can be somewhat inconsistent. Sometimes not cooked enough, sometimes with not enough sauce, and even though they are supposed to have onions in them they rarely ever do. 

Their shredded beef tacos are very good but they seem to have gotten shredded beef and machaca tacos mixed up. At most restaurants a machaca taco is very finely shredded spiced beef, and shredded beef tacos are coarsely shredded beef. Here if you order a machaca taco you get a course shredded beef in a preformed taco shell, and if you order shredded beef you get machaca in a properly deep fried taco shell. Whatever, I just order accordingly. 

Red chile burros are very good. Cheese crisps are sometimes burned on the bottom. Chips are often very fresh and hot, but their hot sauce has WAY too much oregano in it. it's been consistent over the years but WAY WAY TOO MUCH oregano!

They make a MEAN Cadillac Margarita on the rocks.

My wife likes their seafood enchiladas, I can't vouch for them as I don't like seafood that much. 

One note for this and other Mexican restaurants. Why are people charged more when you order something with out rice and beans? Most of the time the amount of food minus the rice and beans is way more than enough. I can't tell you how many times I see plates with rice and beans left on them. They just get thrown away."}
{"text":"Just Average 


Stopped by this Ajo Al's with a co-worker for lunch.  Seating was prompt at lunch time and we had a great server who really stayed on top of things. Atmosphere was casual, we enjoyed the various  southwestern decor around the room. 

I had the Poco Pollo con Queso with rice and my lunch companion had the Beef Taco Salad. I have to be honest, the entrée's were average at best and essentially Ajo Al's is no different then other Mexican food restaurants throughout the valley. My Poco Pollo was a little on the dry side but the flavor was okay.  My lunch companions beef taco salad was large and he said the taste was fine, however, the dressing was not good. We both thought the chips and salsa were really good. The portions at Ajo Al's are large, the service proved to be  good, however, the food is very average. 

I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again, but I wouldn't avoid it either. You could do worse in a pinch."}
{"text":"Ajo Al's, whether in Scottsdale or Arrowhead, always an amazing meal.  Great drinks, food, and values. Never let's me down on quality."}
{"text":"LOVE the fajitas with the veggies cooked extra well. Salsa is very good but the service could be better."}
{"text":"Fast casual Mexican dining-- it's like the Chili's without the corporate sellout.  Comes with the must-have bottomless chips and salsa (salsa is served in a mini carafe, still counts) and great selection of beer (full bar).  I highly recommend their Fajita, which comes sizzling hot, and the Pollo Con Queso, which feels like a mouth filling hybrid of chimichanga-nachos-enchilada. PORTIONS ARE GREAT, I almost never finish! (Each dish serving is roughly 1.5x amount of Chipotle burrito)"}
{"text":"Food has always been good. Generally we have good service. Last visit took almost twelve minutes just to order drinks. The restaurant was pretty empty at 3:30 on a Thursday. I otherwise was pleased with the service. Pollo con queso was great."}
{"text":"The food was delicious! Great service! The only thing was their red sauce was little more spicy than we were use to. I ordered the carnitas tacos which came with rice and beans. The meat was juicy and had a bit of a sweet citrus taste. My hubby ordered chicken chimichanga and the red sauce that came on top was too spicy for him, this same sauce came in a small cup with my meal. If you order this just get it on the side so if you don't like it you don't ruin the rest of your meal. My oldest son is really picky he ordered  chicken fingers which came with waffle fries, his plate was empty by the close of dinner. My other kids ordered kids bean burrito and they gobbled it up. As an appetizer we ordered their queso dip and it was fantastic as well. They provide chips and salsa like most Mexican restaurants...it was very good too."}
{"text":"I came to this location about 10 years ago and it was kind of blah.
We barely gave it another try and I was quite impressed. Andrew was our server and he took excellent care of us. I had the chicken soup, which it was not my favorite because I like my soups with no spices, but the cheese appetizer was excellent, and also the machaca chimi that my hubby had."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed Ajo Al's but don't live close to one so often choose to go other places.  On Sunday, I went for a late lunch craving the Pizza Nortena.  Unfortunately, because I am gluten free, the pizza isn't for me.  But, I mentioned it to our server and she came back to tell me that they could make it gluten free for me.  I had never even thought to ask but here she took the initiative to find out for me.  I haven't had that pizza in almost five years but I can tell you that it is still delicious even when modified with corn tortillas as the base.  The service was excellent.  Overall, this experience was my best one at any of the Ajo Al's locations.  

On a side note, they have the best spicy cream cheese and their salsa is yummy.  If you enjoy Mexican, you will love Ajo Al's."}
{"text":"I went to Ajo Als Arrowhead with my children on 1/13/13 evening after a very long weekend and looking forward to a great meal. After waiting behind several other patrons for at least 3 minutes for someone to notice that there was no host/hostess we were seated. Our waiter was Travis. Travis took our order and after serving the food never returned to check on us. I had the green enchiladas, one child had the red enchiladas and the other had a hamburger. My food literally tasted like nothing. My sons hamburger was dry. After not being approached by the waiter, I begrudgingly ate half of an enchilada. When he delivered the check I told him it was not good. He said \"so you dont want a to-go box?\" I went to the front desk to speak to the manager or get a business card, however no one was there (waited again about 3 min). Today I called to obtain the managers email address (Jose Nava) but Travis answered the phone and stated I needed to call back after 4. I do not have time to take up this cause, but when budgets are tight and dinner out is an occasional family treat, it is imperative that we expect great food and excellent customer service. 
Try Mixteca down the street. Not the best, but much better and cheaper."}
{"text":"Take my review with somewhat of a grain of salt.  I have only gotten the Mexican pizza aside from other appetizers because it is so delicious I do not want to try anything else.  I usually do like a variety but this thing is directly from heaven.  I like this Scottsdale location because it is very intimate.  Their queso dip is alright, not very restaurant-like, it tastes like velvetta."}
{"text":"One of the better Mexican Restaurants in Phoenix & one of my favorites. A very good selection here, I like that they have a Chicken Mole dish, which seems hard to find.  Waaaay better than the overrated Manual's & that Tee Pee Mexican place, which are more like on the level of Del Taco....ew!"}
{"text":"I ate here years ago and it was delicious.  I was looking forward to a great meal with friends.  A few of us ordered Cadillac Margaritas.  I could tell that they were the House Margarita's.  I pointed this our to our waitress, and she said she would check with the bartender.  She left and didn't come back until the food was served.  She then assured me that they were Cadillac Margaritas..but they weren't.   My husband ordered a combo plate with a beef tamale, but it was a green chili and cheese.  Our waitress didn't come back for a while, probably because of the margarita mistake.  We also informed the staff that we were celebrating a birthday, but that was never acknowledged.  I was very disappointed and probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Was decent! Pretty busy. We got the Pollo Con Queso and didn't really like it...the Cheese and Jalapeño Cream Cheese  was really good but chicken was dry. Chips and salsa was really good!  We also got the Green Chili Cheese Crisp and it wasn't crispy enough. Also was too expensive for the taste of our food."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food.  Friendly, attentive service.  Generous baskets of buttery chips and two types of tasty salsa.  Water carafe on the table always kept full.  Tasty cheese crisps and chile relleno.  I've come here by myself a few times and been treated very well, even when dining alone (something I don't do almost anywhere but here).  Ajo Al's always hits the spot."}
{"text":"I hate that I loved this place!
After an afternoon of hiding from the heat in the Arrowhead mall, Ashley M. and I attempted several other chains in Arrowhead/83rd ave area that all had long lines outside before we came across Ajo Al's.  We walked in to the huge restaurant and were seated right away.  I loved the high ceilings and silly stereotypical Mexican decor.  Sombrero anyone?  We were then given the essential salsa and fresh tortilla chips (another reason I have a love/hate relationship with this place...) which just seemed to scream my name once they hit the table.

I ordered the Salad Carbon-Marinated grilled chicken grilled up and then layered over fresh salad greens and veggies with an avocado slice. Topped with fresh onions and shredded cheese and served with Jalapeno-ranch dressing on the side.  As a salad connoisseur, I was expecting far less than the deliciousness which appeared before me.  The chicken was absolutely delicious and went great with the whole salad!  I was very pleased!

1 star removed for being a chain, and for not removing the calories from the tortilla chips."}
{"text":"I went with my co-workers today and I had a Chicken Taco Salad. The service was fast enough for the place being full, the price was average, there was plenty of parking, and I had a great experience. I'd go again."}
{"text":"Very fun place with attentive and pleasant waitstaff. Good food and margaritas for sure."}
{"text":"The food is always fresh and delicious at Ajo Al's on 16th Street. I've dined here plenty of times. January 14, 2016 last night at 7:45pm, I ordered the Mexican Stack; its a Lasagna of a Mexican entrée. #Delicious! The only issue is in my most recent visit, the bartender was not attentive. When I arrived it took 15 mins before she even said, hello. Then she asked if I wanted to place an order, but never offered a menu. Well how can, I place an order if I don't have a menu to review the 'ah so many choices. Therefore I had to ask for a menu.  Next I had to ask for the warm complinary chips and salsa. While in the past, I've dined here plenty of times before,  I've always been offered chips and salsa. Or it was immediately brought out to me. When the chips where finally brought out, I adked for a side of guacamole. Which took another 18 mins. Then I watched her immediately serve new customers....Whom received prompt service,  chips and salsa,  menus delivered without asking....All customers should be treated with the same prompt attention and respect. It is from the every customer that keeps such restaurants in business. It is the customer's verbal and written reviews that a multitude of other customers will read. The irony is, it only takes one employee (bartender last night)@ Ajo Al's to give customers a bad experience."}
{"text":"Always have came here growing up with my family! It's great! I like the shredded chicken quesadilla and their sopapillas."}
{"text":"Chimichanga was soggy and lacking flavor, the margarita was watered down and had no flavor and the beans and rice were dried out.

Atmosphere is good, servers lack knowledge ofeni"}
{"text":"My friend and I meet here at least twice a month for lunch.   The food is great and the service is awesome! Would highly recommend"}
{"text":"So my friend used to live in Scottsdale and told us we had to go here to try the Apollo Con Queso because it was \"the best Mexican dish she's ever had\". She wouldn't let it go and to be honest I was very skeptical because I live in Chicago and truly think we have some of the best Mexican food around. So I went a bit begrudgingly and ordered this chicken cheese thing she was raving about and oh. My. God. This may have been a slightly life changing experience. I'm not sure how truly authentic this dish is cause I've never seen it in Mexico or anywhere else for that matter but it doesn't even matter because it's THAT good. It's basically shredding chicken with white cheese in the center of a deep fried tortilla. They then pour more cheese over it- twice. The taste is unbelievable and worth all the indulgence. The guacamole was meh and the Margarita was one of the worst I've ever had BUT this chicken dish gives this review the 4 stars it deserves."}
{"text":"If you are on a Hindu pilgrimage seeking enlightenment through fasting and hunger........this is your place! 

I have been going to
this location for 16 years and then moved out of the area and I have been back twice now in 6 months. 

Not sure if it's new owners or managers but the quality of the food and service has gone down so far that I will not be returning. It's really sad because this was one of the top places to go for the longest time. I thought maybe it was just me but all my friends and family say the same and have quit going there also. 

$11-13 for bland food with no flavor is what you will get. If you try the steak tacos they will give you 4oz of meat for $13 and it tastes and looks like it was cooked on a flat top stove! Don't waste your money. 

I was born and raised here in Arizona and know great Mexican food. This place was once King of the mountain. Not anymore!

Save your money and eat at home or go to Valle Luna, Don Rubens, Top Shelf or Marisa Seafood Cocina for good Mexican food!"}
{"text":"I'm originally from L.A. and as I bitch about constantly, it is HARD to find good Mexican food in Phoenix and Ajo Al's was a bit of a disappointment. However if a step above Taco Bell works for you, then you'll love this place. My friends and I were on a kick for a time coming here, mainly because they have a decent Happy Hour. If anything, you should check these guys out for that. The restaurant itself is nice on the inside and they have a nice bar so you won't be disappointed if you want a drink and some munchies on the way home from work. My advice, if you're going to hit this place, is to grab a seat at the bar, order a drink and an appetizer, have maybe another drink (or two) then move on."}
{"text":"Okay just to start off all of the Ajo Al's locations are good, I just decided to to write on this one because it has cool cow patterned booths.  I have eaten at plenty of Mexican restaurants but nothing compares to this.  It may not be the most authentic, but it is tantilizingly delicious People who don't like this place do not order the right things.  There are really only 4 things that rotate between.   First, you should always treat yourself to a cheese crisp appetizer. It is very thin and light so it won't ruin the meal  but provides a perfect start  it.  Then for an entree I either get a shredded beef chimichanga or there signature dish, the \"pollo con queso\" which is like a chicken chimi with melted cheese and jalapeno sourcream on top.  Also opt for  the rice and beans to accompany your Mexican dish and you won't be disappointed.  Ajo Al's offers great portions at resonable prices.  Finally if you still have room for dessert there is only one thing to get....the deep fried ice!   I truly hope that someone gives this place a chance because I promise they won't regret it."}
{"text":"Had a great early dinner 
The food was tasty and Amanda was very attentive and fun server."}
{"text":"Ok this is how my evening started:My friend Katy and I walked into Aunt Chilada's restaurant At Squaw Peak on 6/28/2014 to have a awesome dinner. The place had a few parties going on, but as usual it seemed under staffed. So my friend and I sat down and we were given chips and salsa and a bottle of water. About 5-10 minutes later a family came in with small children and after about another 5 minutes or so,  all of sudden a waiter comes out and looked me right in the eye and went to the other table and took their order. Turned around and went back in to the kitchen. Of course this pissed me off. We got up and hostess saw me I explained what happen she said it was her fault. That did not make it OK. The waiter should have said something to us and didn't. So we left Aunt Chilada's in discuss and went down the road to Ajo Al's for a awesome meal and great service..

So now we are at Ajo Al's for the first time and I was speechless when I walked out. The service was outstanding our waitress was Theresa who was very professional & friendly. And the food was excellent. As another Yelper  - Steve V was right about the Cheese Queso Dip it was very tasty.

I will be going back to Ajo Al's again soon."}
{"text":"It was just okay. Went for the first time this past weekend, to check it out. We came in around 1 on Saturday and the place was pretty dead, but for some reason no one was there to greet or seat us, which is always awkward when you walk in and aren't sure if you should be seating yourself. 

We ordered the Pollo con Queso, the mini chimi kids meal and a watermelon margarita. Now, maybe because I normally don't order alcohol when out, unless its a $3 beer, but $9 for a margarita seems darn costly. It was really good, but heck, for that price it better be! The Pollo was pretty good, a little dry, but nothing the pound of cheese and jalapeno cream cheese cant fix :) 

The kids meal was fairly priced, at $5.50, for 3 mini chimis beans and a sprite. He seemed to like it. The waiter was nice, but only checked on us once, after most of our food was finished. 

Would I come back, sure. But was I wowed, no."}
{"text":"Great place. One suggestion is that they need to change their idea of serving salsa with plates to just providing a salsa bowl.

I like the queso dip and chicken fajitas"}
{"text":"Ajo's is a delish Authentic Mexican spot. Their green Chile enchiladas are on point... in fact, They are the reason I converted to green sauce from red sauce. The tacos are ok. 
They do a good job catering as well."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a little girl.... was my favorite then and is still my favorite now. Have never ordered something I didn't like!!! Best Mexican food in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Happy 25 year anniversary, Ajo Al's!

Yes, it's a local chain with four Valley locations, and this is one of the two locations I've actually been to... but it's family owned and operated and still going strong after 25 years.  There's something to be said for that!

It's not at the top of my list, but I've never been disappointed by Ajo Al's.  I go maybe once or twice a year for lunch or dinner.  When I recently had a craving for Mexican food, I suggested this place to my friends and they gladly met me here.  

Our waiter was attentive, the atmosphere is fine, the chips and salsa are addicting, and the food is A-OK.  Portions are large.  I had a burrito (enchilada style per the waiter's suggestion) and a salad and took half of my meal home.  My friends went with a burrito and a quesadilla respectively.  None of us oohed or aaahed over the food, but we ate it and it was fine.  Prices are moderate.  Oh, and my leftovers were just as good the next day for lunch!

One weird thing: on their menu, they list several items with guacamole but it's funny... every time that guacamole is listed they put \"(meatless)\" by it.  Has anyone ever had guacamole that is not meatless?  I found that really awkward!

Anyways, if you're in the mood for traditional Mexican food, you can't go wrong with Ajo Al's.  I'm sure I'll end up there again in another six months or so!"}
{"text":"I ate here the other night with my girlfriend and we were both puzzled when the bill arrived. We couldn't believe we ordered so much and it was so delicious! Definitely coming back soon. 
Oh and the spicy salsa was phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Ajo Als rocks, but this location is hit and miss.  For some reason their chips are consistently not as good as the other locations - it's like they are soaked in grease.  If you can go to either of the Scottsdale locations, you are better off, based on my experiences.

The pollo con queso is great!!! It's the best thing on the menu if you don't care about calories (deep fried chicken burro, smothered in cream cheese and cheddar cheese, mmmmmmm).  If I don't want 2,000 calories in one meal, I go for the Salad Carbone with Chicken.  It's seriously one of the best salads I have ever had.  They marinade the chicken in something wonderful, it's so tender and flavorful, and served with the best jalapeno ranch. !Muy bueno!"}
{"text":"Funny...when I return to my office after eating here, my colleagues raved about how awesome it it. Not as funny, I didn't agree. I did like the atmosphere and the service, but I thought the prices were a little high for lunch although the serving was good. I had the chicken fajitas which were ok. I thought it was a different kind of style than I am used to so I wasn't impressed.

I'd like to give it another shot before I totally condemn a place that is obviously popular, but it's back to Chuy's and Ernie's for now...."}
{"text":"Truly good Mexican food.

I like the atmosphere. Quirky tex/mex decor.

The bean dip and the cheese dip (queso) are simply out of this world fantastic. The quesadilla on the appy menu is great. Lots of cheese the actually tastes cheesy. You can tell they have better ingredients than a lot of Mexican places. 

The main course I had, fajitas, were very good. the meat was more tender and flavourful than the standard restaurant fare. The Tortillas are excellent. I believe made in house. The cheesy chicken meal is also a winner - assuming you like chicken and cheese.

This just might be the best Mexican in the NW valley."}
{"text":"Great Mexican restaurant. I go there for lunch a few times a month and am always satisfied. Highly recommend it"}
{"text":"Sat in bar, food was typical, service horrible 
Bartender came to my table 1 time. 
Had my credit card out for 10 minutes waiting 
3 people in entire bar so it wasn't busy....

However owner did reach out to apologize so I'll give it another try...."}
{"text":"We came here for Valentine's day because my husband's sprint phone was not working.   We drop off the phone and walked over for a quick bite.  We were lucky we got there before the crowd.  We waited for a few mins, before we were greeted and sat.  Within 15 mins, the place was packed with people.  

We sat down and received a basket of warm chips and two salsa.  Then we got two cups and a pitcher of water.  The lady did not say anything to us and left.  I was not sure if she is coming back or not.  ???  

Then our server came to greet us.  She was very nice and told us the special.  She took our drink order and swoosh she was gone.  She had a ton of tables.  She came back quick with drinks and to take our food order.  

I ordered the Comb #11 Chimi with chicken served with beans and rice.  The red sauce had good flavor, the chicken itself was bland, the rice was good, and normally I am not a fan of refried beans but theirs was pretty good.  

To sum up everything, it was ok."}
{"text":"I love this place, so much so that we're having our rehearsal dinner for our wedding here. There's a good story to that, too. When we first spoke to the manager (I'm pretty sure it was the manager) he said that the patio was taken the night we wanted to reserve it. A few months later though, the patio opened up and he called us to let us know. I was pleasantly surprised to know he had kept our contact information all this time and thought to follow through with us, too.
Besides having great customer service, their food is good, too. I love their beef chimichaunga and it's delicious every time."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in about ten years, but I used to go to it frequently.  Needless to say I enjoyed there food and atmosphere.  It's not like those hole in the wall 'authentic' Mexican food restaurants you'll find in central and south Phoenix, but it has good food and service."}
{"text":"I enjoy going here although it is far from authentic Mexican cuisine. You gotta get the mushroom brown sauce it's killer. I enjoy combo number eight with the brown sauce added. Stay away from all of the chicken dishes they are bland and dry."}
{"text":"Much better.  Our server Judith was fantastic.   Friendly and super efficient.  Can't beat the happy hour margarita!  The food was tasty, and the sweet chips were a nice surprise."}
{"text":"Very dissappointed with the customer service. Went there on Friday, 11/15/13 with my family. The waitress spent most of her time trying to upsale. She encouraged us to get extra cream cheese with out pollo con queso (in which we ordered 3). We did, and of course we were charged for the extra cream cheese. My son ordered the kids meal and I explained to her that it comes with a free drink. She already inputted the charge and stated that she would speak with her manager. She never removed the item from the bill. Normally, we overtip on our bill. We usually leave approximately 15% if the service was poor. We left an $11 tip on our bill that was $70.44 ($81.44 after tip) due to the poor service. I checked my bank account today and noticed that our waitress added an extra $1. Total amount charged was $82.44. Ajo Al's just lost a customer for life."}
{"text":"Good, but nothing really outstanding.  Service is friendly and attentive here.  The salsa has quite a kick.  I ordered the Seafood Enchiladas.  Good flavor, wish they had a bit more of a cream sauce or something.  Unfortunately, they did a number on my digestive system the next day..  Good choice for Mexican but does not really stand out from any of the other various choices."}
{"text":"Umm, who took the flavor from my food?  Bland, bland and more bland.  Apparently they only flavor things here by throwing cheese on it.  

Ordered the Tacos Morongo, which sounded a lot like the tacos I've enjoyed at roadside taco carts in Mexico, with avocado puree in little corn tortillas.  Great in theory, poor in execution.  The steak was tough and it didn't even taste like they salt and peppered it for flavor. The other ingrdients faded into nothing.  The hubby's Machaca platter, which the server couldn't decide if it was spicy beef or pork, we're pretty sure it was unspicy pork.  

Portions are large.  Chips and salsa are endless but canned crushed tomatoes, onions and cilantro do not a good salsa make.  Anyone heard of garlic? Jalapenos? Fresh ingredients?  Bah, two stars for being atleast edible and because I feel bad for my friends who like coming here."}
{"text":"A frozen margarita and the pollo con queso was divine! Shredded chicken, flash fried in a tortilla covered in jalapeño cream cheese with melted cheddar over top. They also have the best shredded beef taco on the planet, in my humble opinion. Check out their happy hour, $3 cheese crisps and taco specials!"}
{"text":"I dont know how willing i am to come back to this establishment and pay for it next time.  I was taken to a late lunch and we ordered two different appetizers 1 was amazing the other not so much. I expected so much more out of the queso dip that tasted like straight SALT they were really trying to make me sick.  The potato soup with spicy  bacon cheese sour cream and green onions was out of this world! that is why this place gets 4 stars merely for that and their grilled chicken chimi! I was kind of hoping for a side of guac and not sliced avocado pico mix type ordeal.  
Queso dip- D-
Potato spicy bacon soup- A++
Chimichanga with grilled chicken-B
The place itself was pretty dead maybe 3 tables of people full not including ours so a total of about 4-5 tops.  Now that said, A waitress should have all the time in the world to wait on all tables with flying colors making sure everyones drinks are full and what not.  It was not til the end of our dishes and appetizers that she asked if I wanted a refill and i desperately wanted one when i was eating my food and after eating a couple bites of the queso dip I thought i would love but hated.

The guy I am a caregiver for liked her more than I did but you know how lots of older single men are...

I hope to god that this place doesn't get packed because could you imagine a waitress serving more tables than that and having very agitated men and women over drinks she was lucky i am patient."}
{"text":"Good southwest  Mexa food ...
If you need gluten free,  they have  some choices for you ... 
This is a great  local business"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our lunch here. 

To start: chips with 2 kinds of salsa. One spicy with lots of Mexican oregano and one more mild one. 

Then, we split the lunch portion of mushroom enchiladas, the pollo con queso and a chile relleno. 

We enjoyed everything. It came out sizzling hot and very fresh. Everything tasted great and we will definitely be back. 

My only complaint is that the food is a bit oily. The white sauce on the enchilada was starting to break and there was a small ring of oil around the plate.....same for the relleno ."}
{"text":"The last time I came here I wasn't too impressed but yesterday I went with a friend for lunch and I really liked it. The chips and salsa they serve you when you first sit down are average but I liked how they do give you two types of salsa right off the bat. No need to ask for a spicier one. I ordered the Poco Polla con Queso off the lunch menu. It came with rice and beans for $9.00. It was quite a lot of food for lunch and I ended up taking half of it home with me. I got the black beans and they were pretty good but a little bland. So was the rice. I had to salsa to both of them to give them a little more flavor. But the Poco Polla was excellent and I would go back again."}
{"text":"Don't eat here! Ever! Overpriced. Dry chicken. Nasty beans. Tasted like a TV dinner. The Drinks are super weak. Nice looking restaurant tho! Just needs a new cook."}
{"text":"This place has the best enchiladas in town. From their cheese enchiladas to their spinach enchiladas to their machaca enchiladas they beat all. They have a great cheese dip or queso dip.... They also have a machaca chimi that is not on the menu but you can order it. It Has a brown jalapeño gravy that has a great flavor.... Then for desert I recommend the fried ice cream... The best !!!!!! Their salsa and hot sauce are very good as well.... A must try!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a good average mexican food restaurant. I would say its comparible to Macyos. We did get something on there menu that I have not seen anywhere else . It was enchiladas with mashed potatos shredded beef and a really good sauce on it. I would get it again for sure  when ever i make it back . They get packed for lunch!!!"}
{"text":"We had a nice dinner.  I had the Carne Asada burro,  my husband had the steak piccada and our son had a egg and chorizo burro.  The food was good but the service was a little slow and a bit unattentive.  I think our waiter was both bartender and server so our first details of margs too a while and getting water filled took a bit longer.  The waiter was nice but I think he was overbooked.   Thankfully,  it wasn't too busy.  We did also find a different,  very condensed menu, from what we remember on previous visits but there were enough choices for us."}
{"text":"I have been very dissapointed lately in the quality of the Meixican food restaurants we have visited.  However, being late to find Ajo Al's on Shea just past Scottsdale Rd, i\"m happy to say i have found one of the best mexican restaurants around.  We have only been there once, for to go.  But already want to go back.  Just the most flavorable meal.  And the same with our leftovers the next day.  If you have not been do yourself a favour and give it a try.  A little hidden off Shea in the Agua Caliente center.  May be a diet buster, but come on.  Your looking for some good mexican food for a reason!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of this location. The one off Camelback has much better food and has been around longer."}
{"text":"¡Que lastima!

After ordering this place a multitude of times on Uber Eats, I was extremely excited to DO IT LIVE! Instead it was an extremely disappointing experience full of deception and lies. Normally I would order the beef chimi, but instead changed it up with the PORK BELLY and shrimp tacos. I was absolutely excited as they arrived but noticed one glaring omission... THE PORK BELLY. Instead the kitchen decided to substitute PORK BELLY with a mere strip of bacon. Of course I flagged with the waitress who took the dish back to the kitchen for clarification, and apparently they had run out of PORK BELLY. 

Bacon is delish, but just the mere fact that no one had told me about a substitution and to serve it like it was normal is just absolutely mind blowing. \"Screw it - let's just serve it like this, they won't notice\" is how I imagined the conversation in the kitchen. Yes, they come from the same animal but everyone knows the two are prepared/taste very differently. Unfortunately this turned me off to the whole experience and will not be visiting again."}
{"text":"Ended up here the other night when I was wanting something that would fill me up after a long day and be sin filled.  Mexican is always the clear choice when I'm feeling this way.  

It was a Saturday evening and the restaurant was pretty quiet.  Our service was fairly decent- although he seemed to disappear a little more than I wanted him to.  

I had the spinach enchiladas with rice.  They were cheesy and awesome and just what I needed.  However, it is just your standard average Mexican place.  I have dined at the 16th Street location and this location was consistent with that one.

Not the best spot in the Valley for Mexican, but also not the worst.  I'd choose it over the many generic chains that you have to choose from when faced with Bell Road/Arrowhead area."}
{"text":"Solid Mexican food with great service. Bring your appetite portions are good size and the food is Hot. Don't eat too much chips n salsa."}
{"text":"Hi Yelpers! I had lunch here w/my b/f today and don't plan on coming back. We were completely disappointed in the food here. First of all, we got seated in a tight booth, then a scary, bald headed bouncer looking guy wordlessly brought us some chips & a carafe of salsa (seriously? a carafe for only 2 people??), our food was served VERY oven hot, had to wait like 10 minutes before we could dig in.

Maybe waiting for the food to cool off wasn't the best idea because my ground beef and mashed potato style burrito plate covered in their red suiza style sauce started separating (pools of grease were forming on top of the sauce...very unappealing to say the least). I thought I liked their spanish rice when I first tasted it, however it was too peppery. The refried beans were probably canned. For my burrito, I thought they'd use \"papas\" type of potatoes (those in N.M. know what I'm talking about!), but it was like mashed potatoes stuffed in a burrito along with the ground beef. The description didn't say they added in sliced jalapeno peppers...ugh, was unexpected and I just decided to choke it down. My b/f's enchilada plate didn't fare well either. Certainly nothing to write home about. On a good note, we liked our beverages, iced tea and Pepsi. How can you screw that up? lol! 

So yeah, we don't plan to return. Just wanted to try something new in the neighborhood. Better luck next time :)"}
{"text":"Oh, Ajo Al's.  You have deleted items off of your menu and try as I may I cannot find anything that i like in what remains.  Add to that an extremely lackluster server on our last visit and it will be a VERY long time before i return.  It's the small stuff like checking back in a timely fashion and not just saying \"i'll SEE if i can get that taken off for you\" since i clearly only had two or three bites.  and then as you're halfway to the kitchen remember to come back and ask me if there's anything else i want.  Don't drop the check before asking if we want dessert.  We did, but we went out for frozen yogurt instead since you had already dropped the check off."}
{"text":"While Ajo Al's easily holds the crown for most bearable tex-mex food in town, imho, I still am a far cry from a big fan of here. 

One of my best friends LOVES this place. LOVES it. And I could never figure out why, but I have since turned him onto El Molino in Scottsdale and I haven't heard much about Ajo Al's lately, so maybe he just didn't know any better.

Also, I did hear murmurings of trouble with health code violations here a few months back. Those usually don't scare me too much, in all candor, since perfectly good restarants get the whistle blown on them for relatively minor infractions so often that I've grown somewhat callous to their warnings. 

Further, I'm sure any problem that once existed is now long gone since there was some press about the incident when it happened. 

A good after work place to grab a drink or watch the game with friends, but do yourself a favor and grab some authentic mexican that us Phoenicians are blessed with when it comes time to eat."}
{"text":"My Phoenix friend and I had visitors to the valley from Michigan and British Columbia so we decided to take them out for a Mexican meal.

The chips and salsa were just ok, the chips actually tasted stale.

The meal was quite good. My friend and I had the pollo con queso. Very good with two of the crisp chicken burro's with beans and rice. Enough on the plate to share with someone else.

My biggest complaint is the price of the drinks. I am accustomed to ordering a frozen strawberry margarita and paying anywhere from $4-6 non happy hour. My friend and I ordered a frozen strawberry margarita each and the price was $17.00 for the two. I was flabbergasted!! $8.50 for a margarita?? I didn't ask for any high end tequila just the standard house margarita. I have never paid anything close to $8.50 for a margarita anywhere in the valley and I have been to quite a few different Mexican restaurants. 

I would have given a higher rating but the booze prices are ridiculous here. I suggest going during happy hour and getting your meal in the bar as well, because we were told in the dining room that happy hour prices are only in the bar area."}
{"text":"I honestly hate to update this review but it's a must. The last few weeks something has happen to ajo Al's. The food has gone down hill it isn't like it used to be. I'm not sure what is going on but lately when we come in the food has been pure garbage!
There was hair in our chips like hair fried into the chips! Hair in our food. We ordered the abondiags soup the meatballs were raw! The tortillas that came with our meals were old and stale. It's just the food has gone down hill or the cooks just really don't give a shit.
This place has been our spot for some time and now it seems we will have to find a new Mexican place and a new Sunday breakfast bc we are sick of the poor quality of food"}
{"text":"The food is great. The service is TERRIBLE.  They gave me my food and gave my friend the wrong entree. So instead of taking mine back to keep warm while they prepared his, we just sat there looking at my food. Its rude to eat in front of others :)  Most restaurants will take all the food back and remake it and serve it all at the same time. Thats what real service is.  Other than that issue, the waiter was NOT polite, didnt apologize and never came back to see if we even liked what we were eating. All horrible qualities in a server."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I come into Ajo Al's monthly. He enjoys the chicken and steak fajitas while I like the chicken enchilada with jalapeño cream sauce over the top. The hot salsa is his favorite and he asks for the larger one. The spinach queso dip is an awesome appetizer that everyone usually enjoys. We will continue to make this place our go to and we plan on coming here for the years ahead!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience tonight even though it was rocky at first with a switch in server. Food took a while but they got busy pretty quick! It was delicious and good as always. Kristen took care of us after our first waiter did not come back and she did a great job! Attentive and great people skills. Thank you. We always continue to come back."}
{"text":"WOW how nice it is to find a great Mexican Restaurant and so close to home!  Great service, reasonable pricing and good food!  Definitely on my list to return!"}
{"text":"Cheap, greasy, large portions , fun...... a good place to hang and take mom for dinner..."}
{"text":"Always a Favorite
We have frequented Ajo Als for years and it never disappoints. The food is great (love the hot sauce) and the service even better. Hats off to Liz and Juan who always provide excellent  service. We also really like the casual and friendly atmosphere. If you are in the mood for Mexican food, you can't go wrong at Ajo Als!"}
{"text":"Pretty good value for the money. Fajitas are tasty, though shrimp version was a bit skimpy on the shrimp. Bean dip a winner."}
{"text":"It appears that as I get older, I get cheaper.  Such is my reinforced experience with Ajo Al's yesterday.  I stopped in for lunch with my blind friend, who despite having lost his vision years ago can \"feel out\" good food from eight miles away.  We were seated quickly and I started to peruse the lunch menu, only to be shocked that everything was $9.  Since when in the hell is everything $9 for lunch?  That's a dinner entree price, not a lunch price.  Lunch should be $6 or at most $7.  

After getting over my Scrooge-like reaction at the menu prices, I ordered the pollo con queso (shredded chicken covered with cheese and a spicy baja cream cheese suace).  It was heavenly as I remember it from years ago.  My dining companion chose the mushroom enchilada, which also was quite tasty.  

I still hate the way they serve the salsa here, in tall narrow tumblers.  It's impossible to dip your chips in the salsa container (where is a damn bowl when you need one!) so I had to pour it onto my salad plate and scrape up the salsa from there.  Overall, the salsa is only average.  It needs more kick and this is a big issue for Mexican restaurants in my head.  

You do end up with large portions, but I'd like to see them pare down the portion sizes and the prices accordingly.  Two for lunch cost as much as three for dinner the other night at Juan's on Thomas and 16th Street.  That's not right.  

So, overall Ajo Al's gets a B for food quality but a D for prices.  The salsa helped me arrive at my three-star rating for this place.  With minor changes, this could easily be a four-star place.  Make it so, oh culinary gods!"}
{"text":"Solid 3 stars. Very casual. Salsa not very good. Rice good. Chimi average. pollo con quesa not bad, better than chimi. Overall your average  American-Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"I had my family in town from Oregon and they wanted some good Mexican food. We tried this pace and it was good. there were 7 of us...we only waited about 10 minutes for a table on a week end night. The service was quick and the waiter was attentive.  The chicken tacos and and the green enchiladas were our favorite. the chips for the nachos were decent too. The atmosphere was lively. I made a good hit with the family by bringing them here for some good Mexican food. Worth  the trip."}
{"text":"When we arrived at Ajo Al's, I thought \"Hmmmm, looks like a chain...probably pretty generic food.\"

However, it's a surprisingly good restaurant. Their sauces and salsas are obviously house made and are interesting takes on traditional Mexican fare. Thicker than most Mexican sauces, they are very flavorful.

We went for breakfast. My huevos rancheros were very good. Now, the eggs were a LITTLE overcooked to my liking in this dish, but other than that, this was a very good dish. And you certainly won't walk away from this restaurant hungry - portion sizes are very large.

Our service was excellent. Our waiter was attentive and available to knowledgeably answer all our questions.

Refills were prompt on water, chips and salsa. He was also right there when the first Coronas were gone to see if we'd like another round.

Very festive atmosphere.

All-in-all, a very good experience food wise and service wise."}
{"text":"We were in town for a convention and we were taken here for a local lunch.  What a pleasure.  I am a carnivore at heart but our party ordered MUSHROOM ENCHILADAS BLANCAS $11.95   it was enough for to hearty eaters to share. 
Two vegetarian mushroom, cheese and onion enchiladas with white jalapeno sauce and garnished with fresh cilantro. 
Wow.  First of all I would have never thought of that and secondly the sauce was warm and rich and thick and fantastic.  The mushrooms were not rubbery they were cooked perfectly.  I don't remember what I ordered because that dish blew my mind.  I think of myself a some sort of foodie and this place was lovely.  The staff was welcoming and helpful.  They brought us 2 sauces that we wanted to taste before we ordered and they were great.
Food, staff, service, and price were all very good.
http://www.ajoals.com/menu/    We were at the Camelback location."}
{"text":"Mikayla Eric and alma are amazing. So is Conrado. The service, food and service is amazing. Margaritas on point."}
{"text":"My favorite mexican spot. They have amazing food and good margaritas... definitely would recommend coming here if you havent aLready! Good crew staff as well"}
{"text":"Was really craving fajitas and we have driven past this place many times, so we decided to give it a try. We got seated right away and they promptly brought out a water carafe and silverware. However, we had no glasses to drink the water out of and were told they had run out of water glasses. About 10 minutes later we got some glasses for water. We both got fajitas, mine was all chicken, his was a mix of chicken and steak. My vegetables were completely raw. Very pretty in color, but completely raw. Kept stealing veggie off my fiancé's skillet. Waitress was nice enough, but probably won't come back."}
{"text":"The happy hour is great. Great food choices."}
{"text":"Continuing on my friend's favorite Phoenix and surrounding area places is Ajo Al's.  Apparently she had never been to this particular location though and freaked out about the seemingly real cowhide booths and chairs (she's a vegetarian).  I actually kind of thought it was cool.  I mean, if you're going to kill the animal for food, you might as well use everything.  

I tried the chicken taco salad for lunch. The taco tostada was too stale but the chicken was well flavored. I actually liked the citrusy dressing. Other than some lettuce, chicken, beans and tomatoes, the taco salad seemed to be missing sour cream. I thought it was nice the restaurant was able to split the bill 6 ways (which we had not asked for but appreciated the effort). 

I do give this restaurant the thumb's down for terrible salsa. Pace picante is better than what they tried to give us. And according to a friend, their \"hot\" salsa was not spicy as well. I found this very disappointing."}
{"text":"An update to my last review.  I am very happy to hear from the owner that they will be bring back their red chilli.  I am looking forward to visiting Ajo Al's again."}
{"text":"Amazing!! I had their Spinach Blanco Enchiladas. So tasty and filling!

Really great service always. Not too crowded & noisy to actually have great conversation over an incredibly tasty dish.

Their guacamole is awesome! I see why it is \"award-winning!\"  Very impressive!"}
{"text":"I returned to the Valley a few months back, Ajo Al's was on my top list of return to restaurants as it was my top place to go to while I lived here before. Sadly it's not the same. I had a dish with red sauce which was so overpowering I couldn't even eat it. I mean it was inedible. My friend had the same dish and he couldn't eat his either. 

We also ordered the queso, fantastic flavor but it was so runny just like water. It needed a bit of thickener so the cheese would stay on the chip. 

Lastly, the best part of the meal...I had the prickly pear margarita which was amazing! My friend had a regular and that thing was loaded with the tequila! 

Moral of the story...return for Marje's next time!"}
{"text":"Ok. Not the best Mexican food place. Thoroughly disappointed. Got the carnita taco and not what i was expecting. Maybe i am spoiled by california Mexican food. Not sure what the hype is."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food, good portions and reasonable prices. Staff was courteous and served in a timely manner."}
{"text":"Always a hot fresh meal of Southwest flavors and hospitality.  Love this place.

You need to give yourself a meal here. You will thank yourself later."}
{"text":"Been going there for years, I stuck by them when they got undeserving and inaccurate negative press, and I still love this place.
Keep making food I will keep eating it.  
My favorite is the Pizza Nortena extra crispy with extra green chilis and 4 sides of the very hot salsa verde (you must request the salsa verde)
Green & Red chili are good.  Tacos Morango are great and so are the loaded nachos.  My husband loves the Pollo Blanco Enchiladas.
Bring us a pitcher of Margaritas and we are set."}
{"text":"Came for restaurant week and seriously loved the food. I was a little concerned after seeing their yelp reviews but glad I tried it. Everything was delicious. The service was also good. I will say, I checked out their regular menu because I have the intent to return, but noticed none of the restaurant week tacos were listed on the normal menu online. Unclear if they just did this as a special for restaurant week only or not."}
{"text":"The portions you get at Ajo Als are crazy town! I ordered a taco and a tamale for lunch and I have never seen a tamale that gigantic before! Both were super tasty and I would for sure order them again! 

The chips and salsa are good. The service was a wee bit slow, we went on a Sunday afternoon and there weren't many people there."}
{"text":"Great outdoor seating area if you manage to get a table. 
Service is slow, but very pleasant. We got the feeling that the clientele order the same stuff as when we asked about non-food items (mocktails, wines) he didn't know and had to ask. He had opinions on the food items though. 
The food overall was bla. By that I mean it was edible but was neither tasty nor could you really make out any of the flavours as it somehow all blended into nothing special. 
The veggie enchiladas, the wrap was not fully cooked and our friend couldn't eat it. She refused to make a fuss or give feedback to the waiter so we left it. 
We had food left over, but so unimpressed we left it rather than have it packed to go."}
{"text":"If there was an option I would have given Ajo Al's 10 stars because they have amazing food at excellent prices! The decorations are unique and the atmosphere is relaxing. We visit this restaurant at least once a week and the service is always great!!! This is a place you must visit!!"}
{"text":"Great family owned business! The restaurant is decorated with a cute southwestern feel which gives it a great ambiance while your there! Portions are large, and margaritas are always good!!"}
{"text":"We had a work lunch there today. Food was great service was amazing. There were 26 people in our group. Everyone was very pleased with their meal. Server even split our bills!"}
{"text":"Never had such an amazing experience at a resteraunt this team is awesome and I was definitely taken care of! I will say that service at resteraunts isn't always bad but sometimes mediocre isn't worth your praise. Thank your for the awesome food and great service"}
{"text":"Really wanted our experience and food to be more than bleh, but it was bleh. Had the Pollo con Queso which was good.  Hadn't been here in a while.   Place smells a little musty and looks a little run down. Needs a refresh.  Used to be great food and great place to hang out."}
{"text":"I remember visiting Ajo Al's a few years ago and just found their food to be pretty average in comparison to similar mainstream Mexican restaurants. Nevertheless, I felt a return visit was needed. I considered it a \"refresher course\" of sorts, as my memory was a bit foggy on the quality of the food.

Al's has been around since the 80s - during a time when these types of restaurants had sort of an explosion of sorts. Since then, its maintained average reviews and sort of blends in with similarly-styled places, with nothing really to set itself apart.

They do serve all-day breakfast items, so I decided to deviate from my traditional selections and order the huevos rancheros. My girlfriend, on the other hand, decided to order the pollo con queso, which she recalled liking during our last visit. I inquired about ordering a smoked carnitas taco a la carte, but was told by the server that I would be required to order a minimum of two for eight dollars. Thanks, but no thanks. When my girlfriend said that we've ordered four dollar tacos on many occasions, I brought logic into the equation. I mean, have any of these types of restaurants (i.e. Macayos, Luna, Carlos) served a taco that's worth a damn? Let alone four dollars each? I seriously doubt that Al's would be any different.

My huevos dish was a bit bland, so I was hoping to liven it up with some Mexican hot sauce. You know, the staples that are found at all legitimate Mexican restaurants. Some Tapatio, Valentina, or Cholua would easily help. The server, who seemed a bit confused by my request, rummaged through the back kitchen and came back with what he said was the only thing he could find:

A practically empty bottle of Tobasco Sauce. 

Wait . . . what?!

I'm sorry Al, but your Mexican cuisine credibility has been permanently tarnished in my gringo eyes.

Anyway, my girlfriend wasn't really impressed with her pollo con queso, claiming the meat tasted like it came from a can. I took a few bites and while the cheese and cream were fine, the meat definitely wasn't up to par. 

For dessert, I remember them having a decent fried ice cream based on our last experience. After the server just handed us the bill without asking (a big no-no with us!), we told him that we weren't quite finished yet.

Apparently, they were also short on plates this evening, as our ice cream, which is typically served on a flat plate, was brought to us in some kind of bizarre looking bowl which resembled those Asian conical hats like Raiden wears in Mortal Kombat. 

Unfortunately, I remember the ice cream tasting better. There was no crispness to the breading, but just a strange chewiness with strawberries which tasted a bit artificial. Needless to say, it was not what we had hoped. We've seen fried ice cream done well, but this definitely wasn't it.

Would we come back? Doubtful. There's better food to be found elsewhere if you know where to look. But if you want some Tobasco, they've got your back! At least for a few droplets worth.

Not recommended."}
{"text":"This is always a hit.  It's my go-to Mexican restaurant in the area, and the food never disappoints.  I wouldn't call it terribly unique, but the food is really, really solid and they have lots of great options.  I love the taco salads and enchiladas especially.

The one thing I can't figure out is their salsa strategy.  There are chips and two different types of salsa.  One is served in a little cup and is way too spicy for me.  The other (delicious salsa) is served in a carafe, so you have to pour it in something to use it.  Puzzling, but not a huge problem.  I definitely recommend Ajo Al's."}
{"text":"Typical chain Mexican food restaurant, nothing stands out as 'authentic', it's more Americanized.

The prices are not at all reasonable for chain Mexican food however, which is one main reason for rating it as two stars.

The service both times we have been here is sub-par, despite not being busy. 

Happy hour is the only time I would recommend eating here as the prices are reasonable and the items are fairly good."}
{"text":"Good food, large portions on food however the Margaritas are small in size. The chips are really good, not a big fan on the Salsa."}
{"text":"I would give 0 stars if possible. The staff was either extremely rude or unengaged. The food handling in the kitchen is questionable. The food was sub par and some items were disgustingly cross mixed with others. Rather than trying to help, the manager was condescending and rude. Very bad experience."}
{"text":"Rarely am I ever this disappointed with a place...All of it - the food, service, and experience.  Given that it had 3 1/2 stars, that usually tells me a place is worth checking out.  Not this place.  All minuses.  I have to say I agree with Ryan N and the other reviewers' not so positive experiences.

My friend and I wanted to try something out in the Arrowhead area and I am even the one to want to give it a chance.  Family owned is always a pull for me.   

We first started with the Spice Jalapeno Bean Dip.  NOT spicy at all.  All it was was a big bowl of refried beans with a few Jalapeno pieces in it.   Ok, not happy but at least we have the meal still to go so I wasn't going to be bothered too much.  First strike.

The wait for our food was unusually long which is worth it if the food was good and had care put into it.  There was nothing special or dif. that should have made the wait that long.  The place was not busy.  It was only a third full.  Second strike - since the food was not worth the wait.

I ordered the Tacos Morongo.  It specifically says that they use HANDMADE corn tortillas which was the sole reason for me ordering them.  When I got my meal, they were definitely NOT handmade.  Hmmm...ok...so I decided to try it still.  Eh.  Not horrible but for the long wait, definitely not great at all.  Mediocre.  Third strike

My friend got the steak fajitas.  It was more like veggie fajitas.  It was so bombarded with green and red peppers that you couldn't SEE the meat.  We found 5 pieces.  Ok, maybe where they lack in qty, they make up for quality.  Sorry, no go.   Fourth Strike.

What put the icing on the cake (in a horrible way) was the waitress and how she handled things.  The next time she came by our table, I was already done with 1 1/2 tacos.  She asked how it was.  What happened next just about put me over the edge.  She asked how we were doing but was WALKING AWAY to another table as she did.  I am sure she expected the typical \"fine\".  I asked her why it didn't come with handmade tortillas.  She started babbling reasons.  I then calmly told her how I was very disappointed that it didn't come with them and that it was the sole reason I got them.  All she said was \"I'm Sorry\" all while still WALKING AWAY!   I don't need the world given to me or even a comped meal but it would have been nice if she actually stopped, cared or tried to make things right like bring me the handmade tortillas.  Fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth strike.

I'd let Ajo Al's know but their website doesn't give you any way to write them. 
I usually give the benefit of the doubt but with the strikes coming for all sorts of reasons, I just can't."}
{"text":"Been coming here for many years.  Although the food has had slight ups and downs I would have to say that overall it's never disappointing and the people are always very nice. 
I want to give it 5 stars but I think 90% is a solid summation of my experiences here. 
If your new in town this is definitely a must visit and should be a staple for a great lunch dinner or happy hour. 
I order the fajitas steamed instead of with oil so it's healthier and only had an issue once getting it that way out of the kitchen (hence the 90%). It's much better that way to me. 
Chips and salsa are dangerously good and they are pretty generous with them. I try to exercise self control but they usually defeat me. 
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Very consistent at this location. 
I hadn't been here in years and a friend recommended we stop in. 
The place looked very clean and obviously well cared for and properly updated. I was pleased to see that the quality level was still very high. I frequent the one off of Camelback in Phoenix and that one is always solid too. 
Unfortunately cant say that for the one off of 92nd Street. Its almost like that one has a different owner.
Anyway, this location is a solid place to get good quality Mexican food with excellent service too. we arrived about 10 minutes till close on a slow night and they were very accommodating about staying open for us. Didn't even flinch when we walked in the door and asked if they were still serving. We even walked out with the staff and they were all 'thank you' and smiles. Very genuine. 
Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Ok... I have mixed reviews about this place.  My first time here, I thought it was amazing!  But then the next time, I got the same exact thing (chimichanga with shredded beef add cheese, rice, and black beans inside) and it was overcheesed and the beef was so salty I almost couldn't eat it.  I've eaten here 4 or 5 times now and every time has been a different experience. I gave them 3 stars because the food quality had been wildly inconsistent. I still order here in hoping for that first time experience which I got on my last time ordering, so, when I'm in the mood for Russian Roulette with my food, this is the place I go."}
{"text":"My family loves it here. It's not the fanciest and maybe I'm just sentimental but the food is consistently good and they make THE best skinny margaritas. Most places make skinny margs that taste like watered down limeade - the ones at Ajo's are full of flavor and strong. They also have some of my favorite queso in PHX.

If you're coming here for the first time - don't be intimidated by the menu. It's very busy (they need a redesign with a new graphic designer asap) but they carry all the Mexican-American basics. The service is pretty standard but it's certainly worth checking out if you're looking to try a New Mexican place."}
{"text":"We didn't come here looking for authentic Mexican- just wanted some basic Americanized Mexican take out and even with those standards we were pretty disappointed. The queso tasted more like a cream based spinach dip than cheese. The spicy bean dip was bland and not spicy. A nice tip is to mix these two together and it's pretty tasty. The rice and beans that came with our dinner was extremely dry and bland and the burros and tacos left a lot to be desired. We picked this place based on location and decent reviews but won't be back."}
{"text":"Always a staple for our Mexican Food place to go, unfortunately my Steak Chimi was not the best today - BUT, John the manager came around checking with everyone about how the food was at which point I had the opportunity to explain that the steak was very fatty and hard to eat today which is not the norm.
Bottom line, John the manager took the meal off of my bill and was very descriptive about how they are looking into changing the meat supplier to a better cut of meat.... 
John was a great Manager and did what a good Manager should represent in a restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"What happened to Ajo Al's????? For 15+ years we frequented Ajo Al's @ Scottsdale & Shea. Like once a week for years. It was among the first restaurants in the Valley to start pushing the boundaries of routine Mexican food. Among the first to add a variety of seafood dishes...among the first to add a variety of vegetable options. The service was bright and prompt...the food was high quality and consistently hot and delicious. So 7 years ago (in 2010), I moved to uptown Phoenix and Ajo Al's on 16th St was close. Yay! Or so I thought. My time as a customer there started out well. Same great service, same great menu, same delicious food. I took my friends from South America and France; they still talk about the place and its great Mexican food. However, about 3 years ago, things started to slide. First, service became sloooow and inattentive. The food was not up to their usual standards. Last night, I gave Ajo Al's another shot and it was the last time. A niece was in town and craved great Phoenix Mexican food. Ajo Al's was my first choice. We walked in to a pleasant greeting from the hostess and we were quickly seated in a dining room booth near the end of the bar. Chips and salsa arrived immediately. \"Could we also have hot salsa?\" I ask. \"Oh, we don't have hot today.\" is the answer. Huh? We start on the chips...cold, oily and stale. Huh? 5 minutes go by...then 10...still no water...no offer of drinks. Huh? No one is even glancing in our direction. Huh? Then, we start looking at the menu. Ajo Al's menu is now four small sad pages. The creativity and pushed boundaries are no where to be found. Many of the vegetable and seafood dishes have disappeared. So after reviewing the now minimal menu and still having no idea of who our server might be and still no water or any drink...I tell my niece we're out of here. I stop at the hostess to say \"you know how long we've been here, chips immediately came but no water and no service.\" She looks at me and says \"do you want to talk to the manager?\" I say \"why?.\" She says \"maybe you can work something out.\" Huh? We walk and as for me, never to return. Alas, poor Al's...I once knew it well."}
{"text":"Went there on a whim one Wednesday evening with a couple of colleagues and I must say I am very pleased to have discovered this place. The decor and ambience was welcoming and the crowd quite mixed with a healthy dose of families with little kids. I liked everything, the house margarita was excellent and the soup was also good. The portion sizes were large for me so I decided to stop with the soup, but I really wanted to try the omelette. I will surely be back to this place, and next time get that omelette!"}
{"text":"Simply good Mexican food in a lovely atmosphere! We love coming here for family dinners. Great for families and wonderful for children (they have a dedicated kids' menu). The service is great... very attentive! We are long time customers and we will continue to be for a long time to come!"}
{"text":"Family has been going here since the late 90's. I always get the same dish. Pollo Con Queso. The last few times we visited somethings have changed. The table salsa was way to HOT. This Gringa couldn't even eat it. And then- The jalapeno cream cheese on my Pollo con queso had chunks of jalapenos, not diced or smaller as usual.....Way to hot for me......"}
{"text":"The Ajo Al's on 16th St has always been my home for good mexican food.  Until this place.. HOLY...  I love this place.  First off, the actual building is incredible.  Kudos to whomever designed this place.  It looks awesome.  

Their chips are great along with the delicious salsa and hot sauce.  My only complaint is the last time I went , the chips were old tasting.. I could tell they gave me the bottom of the chip drawer. 

I  love this place and will be coming back often!"}
{"text":"Awesome machaca burror with the brown sauce..Yum. We love it. Why is Macayo's busy when there is Ajo Al.s down the road. Macayo's is worse than Taco Bell..Wake up people .."}
{"text":"I liked it. Not sure I loved it, but our server was great and moved things along for our party of 6 pretty quickly. Prices are good, everything was ok but just not sure it has the authentic Mexican taste I was craving. Just sort of reminded me of any commercial place back home which is not what I was looking for. But, if you are looking for a fun place that can accommodate a slightly larger party and you want fast service, this is a good place."}
{"text":"Stopped in for Happy Hour before the movies. Great drink specials as well as food specials. The mini Chimi's are great and the tacos are just right. Casual atmosphere in a good location. Bar tenders were great and we munched and watched the Cubbies win Game 2!"}
{"text":"This place is good for what you get price wise. They have great burritos and some organic options for margaritas and gluten free options for food.

You walk in and it has a good vibe and it's colorful and some fun artwork. 

They have a nice happy hour during the week that is for drinks and appetizers. 

My favorite appetizer there is the queso dip. Very good! I get it every time and sometimes I'll even call it in for a pickup."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Food Is gross (How can you mess up a cheese enchilada?), and margarita was below average. Never coming back, this place is too over priced for the poor quality it provides."}
{"text":"We came in about 1:00 on a Sunday and sat at a booth in the bar. After about 5 minutes of sitting there, we were greeted and ordered two waters to start with. After another 15 minutes we hadn't received our waters and still had no menus to look at. We decided to ask the hostess to seat us in the dining room instead. She said it would be a 5 minute wait. There were plenty of empty tables but they were all dirty with no bussers in sight. We decided to just go somewhere else at that point."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place and will definitely come back next time I'm in Scottsdale. We got the Mexican pizza (white chicken and cheese) which was to die for. It was unique and extremely flavorful. We sat at the bar, but the ambiance would be worth having a sit down dinner. I have also heard that the pollo con queso is one of the best things on the menu and hope to try it next time!"}
{"text":"Just your average Mexican joint. Food was good prices aren't too bad. Atmosphere is very nice with y'all ceilings and waiting staff is super nice! It's a stop every time we are in AZ."}
{"text":"I (like others) am at a loss as to why this place has such a good overall review. tasteless and awful"}
{"text":"Good was ok. Not as good as it had been. Lots of mistakes by the server. Why are there screaming kids in the bar??"}
{"text":"We came for the Restaurant Week special and we're blown away. The chips and salsa we're really good...but the gucamole was on point! Amazing. The chicken and steak tacos were fantastic as well. We loved this place and highly recommend it."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. We had planned for a graduation dinner at a different restaurant. HUGE mistake. We changed our minds and Ajo Als took us right in no wait for a 7 party dinner. The food is delicious and iced tea is awesome. Their service is FAST! I will continue to do parties here"}
{"text":"--Conveient location.

--Food is pretty good...the meat portions are generous for the fajatias.

--Service was quick and effcient.

--Good chips and salsa"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Ajo Al's in about 12 years (since I left to go to college) but it is still just as good as it used to be. I had the chicken fajitas, which might seem expensive at $15, but I'm a big guy and there was enough food for left over lunch the next day too. Overall, if you are looking for a good tex-mex sit down restaurant, don't pass up Ajo Al's. If you are looking for a cheap carne asada burrito, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Nice embiance, good service. 
I've been on a MAD search for good mexican food in AZ and haven't come up with too much so this deserves a yelp! 
It's an actual restaurant not a taqaria where you get the tiny to go containers of salsa and hard crispy tacos.... 
Its restaurant bowl of salsa, it's actually small picher of salsa (homemade) so you don't have to keep asking and waiting for more! Chips were fresh and I had the chicken fajita and it all had a very good flavor, they piled veggies on it and I love that cause usually there's like 5 slivers of bell peppers and such....
The rice was good (not the best I ever had) but good, didn't have onion, corn or carrots... I like that fact too! 
Beans had a good taste.

I would compare it to Abuelos or a Chevys.

It seems most of the Mexican joints around town are mostly the taqaria's where you typically get your quickie crusty taco with grease dripping and your chips and salsa that you had to pay extra for... 
That's why I like Ajo Al's ! 

So I say try this place if you haven't. 

OH and I didn't even have the fried icecream (they are famous for it) but they said it comes with a flake crust in a cinnamon bowl with whip cream strawberries and honey on top !!!!!!!! 
Can you imagine how yummy that is ? Sugar coma !"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite Mexican food in Arizona. I've been eating at Ajo Al's since I was a kid and it never let's me down.  The tacos el carbon are amazing!  Over the years I've eaten just about everything on the menu and you just can't go wrong."}
{"text":"For a chain Ajo Al's is pretty decent. Shrimp fajitas, tacos morongo and fish tacos are all really good. All their taco plates come with great side sauces (tomatillo, chipotle cream, avacado puree). They also make a pretty yummy breakfast burrito.

I'm not a huge fan of their salsa, but they have a decent hot sauce. Their sangria is not actual sangria made with wine, but a fruit juice blended drink (beware). Top shelf margs are awesome.

The place is usually packed and I have always had great service."}
{"text":"The pollo con queso is to die for. I don't need the beans and rice, btw the entree chips, salsa, and cheese crisp I'm stuffed.  Now that I have have moved out of Phoenix I miss the best Mexican food ever. I always make sure to come here whenever I'm in town."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant in Phoenix!  I alway have a great experience there, and the food is always great.  The queso dip, fajitas, chicken con queso, and fried ice cream are next level."}
{"text":"Dead on a Friday night. No wonder! Food was bland with no flavor including the salsa. Service was good but that's the only positive. I have been in the area for seven years and this is my first time visiting. I haven't missed a thing! Skip this place!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here many times for the past 7 years, but hadn't been there in about 3 or 4 months.  Seated right away, and server was prompt.  Chips were cold and one sauce served now in a little plastic cup.  Margaritas were better than ever before, so that was a plus. Cheese crisp came out swimming in oil.  We didn't realize until we had pulled some pieces out.  We took a few bites and sent it back to be cooked.  They returned the same one, that had been cooked a little while longer but was still soaked in grease. Lunch came pretty quickly.  Two of us had tacos that were so salty we thought the salt shaker had been spilled into them. Two of us ordered red chili burros that weren't served hot, and were bland. I don't know what happened here, but we were really disappointed and don't plan on returning any time soon. Too bad because it is so close and in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"We had chips and salsa, cheese crisp and a delicious taco salad.  Stuffed!!  Everything was perfect and the service was spectacular!"}
{"text":"This place was delicious! My husband and I were trying to find a good mexican place because he is obsessed with mexican food, and we came across this place. 

Evironment is really nice. The waitress that helped us was nice as well.

We both wanted water so they gave us a full pitcher at our table thay was very convenient.

The food was tasty. I myself don't favor mexican food, but I enjoyed my meal and would go back anytime."}
{"text":"Had dinner here for the first time last night. I never knew this was a restaurant I always pass it by when I stop by the bank. The building just kind of throws you off. This is a Mexican/American restaurant with a small bar inside. 

Okay let me just start off with the menu, it was so busy for me lol.  There is too much going on in there.  Of course we were looking for alcohol beverages and sadly they don't have an alcohol beverage menu? We asked our waitress and all she said \"we have a full bar so any drink you want we can make\".  I just wanted any of their specialty drinks like any other restaurant would have. Their only specialty drinks were margaritas (figures lol). I ordered their blood orange margarita on the rocks and it was yummy. 

For dinner I went with their enchiladas and surprisingly they were so good!!! I was expecting this place to be somewhat like mackayos or garcias but their food is more tastier than those places. Everyone we went with had great things to say about their dish. 

For dessert we ordered a flan to split with my mother in law. And I am sorry but that was probably the worst flan i have ever had in my flan life. Don't order it flan enthusiast you will be HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED. 

Customer service was ok waitress was nice, but extremely slow. She seemed to have no kind of interest in taking our orders after we all stopped looking at our menus. Didn't ask if we wanted dessert before handing our bill. We waited about 15 min before she came back for the bill just for us to add more to our bill. It just wasn't very great service."}
{"text":"I'm a regular at Ajo Als. Always enjoyable. 
Last night... from the minute we were seated.. I knew it was off. 
We were seated in the bar area. I don't mind that. Nice booth. 
Menu given to us was regular menu and a Happy Hour Menu. It was way past Happy Hour..don't get that. 
Asked Jennifer if they had a tequila menu. \"No but I can tell you the ones we have\". Uh... okay. 
Gave our order... look at the booth behind us... there is a liquor menu. Why wouldn't she give us that? I find that odd. 
Food came out quickly and was satisfying. 
Jennifer appeared and I asked for a box for my left overs. 
Brought the box.... never asked to box it. 
Brought the check. Never asked if we wanted dessert. 
Yeah.... she phoned it in for sure."}
{"text":"This place has been a long time favorite of mine and I just returned during a recent visit to Phoenix and was reminded why it is so great.  The salsa is particularly good, and I also discovered the jalapeño cream sauce available for smothering your chimichanga- absolutely amazing. I will definitely go back on my next visit."}
{"text":"Ajo Al's is a fantastic restaurant that is more if a family than anything else. The food is so good but the ownership and wait staff are genuine and kind people. I have eaten there multiple times this week and not once did I have a bad meal or experience. They have been around for 20 years for good reason."}
{"text":"Not as great as it used to be but still some of the better Mexican food you'll get in the northwest valley."}
{"text":"I was disappointed when we went here. Could have been all the hype in the reviews so I had my expectations up.  My burrito tasted like onion soup. My boyfriend was disappointed with his burrito too. Wouldn't recommend going here. Service was good, though."}
{"text":"Good food, the waitress was awesome! Loved the atmosphere. Went here for lunch and stayed chatting for a while after we finished. Not once were we rushed to leave. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Ajo Al's has a great happy hour. Lots of great food and drink options. Bartender Savannah was super helpful and crafts a mean margarita. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Ajo Al's has been one of my favorite locals only places in the Valley. The food is great, the portions are large, and the atmosphere is homey. It's the kind of place that feels like if you started coming every week, people would know your name.

My two favorite dinners are both specialties: Mushroom Enchiladas Blancas and Pollo Blanco Enchilada. Both have their delicious white jalapeño sauce. 

While you are here, check out the bathrooms. Very nice!"}
{"text":"Overall, the food is good but truly NOT mexican in the real sense of the word. It is generally well served but if you do request to hold the cheese in the burrito or omelette,do count of having it included since the chef/cook does NOT pay attention to the orders given. The coffee is flavored and NOT the requested regular coffee. The staff truly didn't care about the fact fact that you requested and pay for regular coffee and NOT hazelnut flavored coffee drinks. I would consider/ think twice before going there again."}
{"text":"Here with family and friends while in Arizona this month. Average Mexican food, the salsa was pretty good. Very Americanized food. Not terribly impressed but the place was packed, so obviously others feel differently. There is so much better Mexican food in Arizona."}
{"text":"We have never had a bad experience at Ajo Al's,  Jessica in the bar was very attentive even though she was kind of busy. My wife and I usually share the chicken/beef fajitas, we were not disappointed again it has hot and fresh and full of flavor.  they are generous with the chips and salsa, which is all ways nice not to have to beg for more.  keep up the good work we will be back for our date night in the near future."}
{"text":"Great food always!  Rice and beans are great.  Happy hour is very good as well. Get the $3 house margaritas!"}
{"text":"I arrived at Aja Al's ten minutes before they open.  The doors were unlocked, or so I thought so went in to sit and wait for people I was going to meet.  I was met with a very unfriendly, \"we are not open until 11 AM.  She was on the phone and wouldn't listen that I was just going to sit in the waiting area for three others, but I went outside and sat.  She then opened the door at 11 AM and wondered how the doors got unlocked??  She was all friendly and told me I could come in now.  By that point I was not a happy camper so told her I would wait for the others outside.  We finally went in and ordered.  My food was totally overcooked.  How can you mess us Huevos Rancheros?  They did.  The eggs were not over medium but hard all the way through, no sauce on the eggs and the corn tortillas were cold.  All in all it was a poor experience and will not be going back again."}
{"text":"Excellent service and the food was perfect. Got the Pollo con Queso chimi and it was delicious. The cream cheese and and jack cheese was a temple of heavenly melted deliciousness that warmed my heart with every bite. I went to Valhalla. Guacamole was great and service was so easy and attentive, Server named Gera did a phenomenal job and overall staff was friendly. Great place"}
{"text":"Been going to Ajo Al's for 20 years!!!  Mexican pizza with shredded beef, cream cheese, guacamole is to die for!!!!!  Add chips and salsa, and the fried ice cream and this equals one of my very favorite meals of all time!  Love having an Ajo Als close to my home."}
{"text":"The Mexican pizza add beef and cream cheese is to die for!  Their fried ice cream is the best ever.  The chili relleno is very flavorful and delicious.   My favorite Mexican food  restaurant!"}
{"text":"This was the second time I have been to Ajo Al's.  The first time was about 10 years ago when I first visited Phoenix.  I remembered it well.  I like the atmosphere.  Warm and welcoming, lots of cool are and things to look at.  I did not know this was a chain until I read the other reviews.  This is no Chevy's though.  This is far better, in my opinion.  The chips and salsa are fresh and flavorful and plentiful.  The basket they bring you is huge!  I had chicken flautas and they were delicious.  They topped them with guac and pico de gallo.  The rice was fluffly and moist and the beans were good too.  I only had ice tea but that was some of the best ice tea I have ever had.  I don't know what made it so good.......I mean it's ice tea, but I downed two glasses of it in no time flat.  

I know there are tons of other non-chain mexican places in Phoenix and I will try them all!!  I love mexican food!!  But I will come back to Ajo Al's too.  I'd like to try a margarita next time.  :)"}
{"text":"Great food! You have to try the Pollo Con Queso. I've been to multiple locations and have never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"This is one of the better Ajo Al's I've been to.  Service is much better here than at the 90th Street location.  Normally, you're stuck waiting 15 minutes for chip and marg refills, but not here.  Oh no.  Your waiter will swoop down out of nowhere with more of whatever you want- sometimes before you even want it. 

I had great margs here too. Perfectly salted, perfectly strong...these margs turn a bad day into a fabulous one.

The food is pretty tasty too.  Ajo Al's isn't upscale- but it's definitely nicer than Manuel's.  And the menu has quite a few different items than any other chain Mexican restaurant I've been to.  They even had bean flautas on the menu.  It's rare that a Mexican restaurant offers variations of their meat-filled favorites, so that scored some major points with me."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place looking for some decent Mexican food. After living in both Denver and CA that have amazing and cheap Mexican food, It amazes me how many terrible Mexican restaurants are in Arizona considering how close we are to CA and Mexico!  However, Ajo Al's was decent.  Drinks were great. They actually have quite a bit of alcohol in them. Blanco Enchiladas and retried beans were good and chips and salsa were great. I really loved the atmosphere- colorful with high ceilings, good service, not overly noisy.  The flan and tacos were also good. 

However, 3 stars because they are a bit overpriced considering similar places. $50 for 2 drinks/2 meals and a flan is a bit much. I will be back to check out Happy Hour and hopefully lower prices.  Their menu online also differs from the one we got sitting down so some confusion on that."}
{"text":"The food was good the service was friendly. This place is very hard to find... poor visibility."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with my family and it was a great experience. John which I think is a manager was totally awesome and is a big reason we had a good time. My kids loved the food. I thought the food was pretty good and they gave large portions. I'm sure we will be back to try other things there!"}
{"text":"awful, got a beef taquito, and it did not look like beef and had a funny taste and smell."}
{"text":"This is a great place for Mexican food.  To begin with, it's cute with modern southwestern art and comfortable booths. Great salsa (don't forget to ask for the salsa Verde which has habaneros and is super spicy) and really thin chips. My favorite things to get here are the steak fajitas, chile rellenos, mushroom enchiladas, and green corn tamales. Prices are reasonable and the food is consistently good."}
{"text":"Drove all the way from Houston for the Mexican pizza at Ajo Al's. This is our favorite Phoenix restaurant!"}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. Not too tasty. Salsa blah, beans and rice too salty. Only thing I feel confident in recommending is the Mexican pizza app w/ chicken. Big enough to share.  Other than that, the price is too expensive for the food served."}
{"text":"Who would think they would have good Mexican food in Scottsdale, but they sure do.  I have never tried this place, and it was across the street from where the wife and I were staying so we decided why not.  It was cheap, around 25$ for both of us, and was good.  I ordered the chimichanga and it was really good and was pretty big.  The chips and salsa were tasty, as were the rice and beans.  Our server was great and checked in on us quite a few times.  Overall, it's a great place that's nice in the Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"Whoever is answering the phone there tonight for takeout orders is super rude. 
I get that Friday nights are busy, but you can't be so rushed to get to other people that you're demanding answers to questions that you've interrupted me answering multiple times. I felt like I was getting barked at while trying to order. When I said \"you're being really curt and cutting me off\" he said \"ok\" and hung up. 

Management needs to either hire people who can handle a busy Friday night, or train them to be able to handle it. 

I'll be going somewhere else tonight."}
{"text":"I am sitting at this restaurant right now. Our waiter was amazing, that's the reason they got one star , which I wish I could give zero. We are a table of 6, getting a lot of drinks and don't care what the price is. Our food came out cold, all at different times and tortillas hard. They ran out of Pepsi, ran out of to go containers and never gave us refills. We asked for the manager, he was a total idiot. He didn't care and just looked at us with the stupidest look on his face . He just stared at us . He did not know what to do. Hopefully they get some new management in this place or it's going to go downhill."}
{"text":"The pollo fundido was AMAZING! Salsa could use more cilantro but otherwise it is delicious as well. Great service. Great price."}
{"text":"Great food service was kinda slow but I did see a huge charter bus so that was understandable !! But once we received are food it was delicious!!'"}
{"text":"This is my go to lunch spot by work. Service is quick and the food is good. Definitely order the hot salsa with your food; the regular salsa is kind of bland. Menu is full of Mexican/American favorites. Nothing is really spectacular or revolutionary, but it's all pretty solid. I've never been disappointed.

If you're looking for decent Mexican food near the Biltmore/Camelback area, this is always a good choice."}
{"text":"$2 mini frozen blended margaritas for Monday happy hour! They're not mini at all, and so delicious!"}
{"text":"Pollo. Con. Queso. Need I say more? Always get friendly service here, the margaritas are tasty and the food has always been hot and delicious. Huge portion sizes so I always have leftovers. I will say, could use little bowls for the salsa as opposed to pouring it onto your plates but overall great place.

Update: bowls for salsa are now here!! They changed how they present their chips and salsa.. it now comes on a platter with a bowl of salsa instead of a bowl of chips and carafe of salsa. Awesome. 

I strayed from my usual pollo con queso today to get the shrimp and pork belly tacos and they were so good.. better than expected good. They had a sweet corn taste to them. Great meal per usual."}
{"text":"The Mexican Pizzas here are phenomenal.  Excellent service too, I waited maybe 10 minutes for my food on a busy night."}
{"text":"I love mexican food, in fact, I'm obsessed with it.  This place is delicious!  The hot sauce is great, chips are great and salsa is great.  My only complaint is that the salsa doesn't come in a bowl.  Instead it comes in a carafe which you would pour onto your plate.  Ugh.  Not the way to eat salsa.

That aside, everything I've ordered here is great and exactly what I expect from a mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"The place was ok. I ordered the fish tacos and they were tasty but I've had much better. I was starving, so I devoured everything in seconds as the tacos weren't big and I had only two on the plate. My boyfriend had the steak and mushroom enchiladas which he enjoyed and we both liked the house margaritas. The prices were about what I would expect from this kind of place but I really prefer more authentic Mexican than this more Americanized stuff or maybe it's just considered Southwest. I liked that they served the salsa in a generous bottle. It's a step up from Chevy's but not enough to make me choose it over a taqueria. The server was really good."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Ajo Als. We had heard good things. Short 15 min wait for a table of 5 on Friday night. Service was quick, friendly and attentive. The chips and salsa were tasty and not too salty. I preferred the hot sauce, the mild was ok but not the best Ive had. All of us were very happy with our dishes, freshly prepared and very tasty! Only one minor speed bump, my sister was drinking the Ajo Rita (the premium) the first 2 were very good and served in a cool cactus margarita glass, her 3rd was served in a pint glass and definitely wasnt the same margarita, but we were charged for 3 premiums. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican resturaunts to go to. It's not the most authentic Mexican food but it's also not Americanized. They serve Pollo Con Queso, my wife's favorite. One of few resturaunts that serve it. The service was slow. We didn't get refills in time, in fact we had to wait a while. The server did not check within the first 5 mins of eating which I feel is always a must. That's when you realize you need something or they forgot a side dish or two. The food tasted good. We did check there ingredients a few months ago and I believe their cooking oil and frying oil is not trans fat. Their corn and flour tortilla were also clear of trans-fat oil. Need to double check. I am not 100 percent clear on that."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Friendly staff.  Great food. All at a reasons price. 

Had the chicken burro with green sauce. It was fantastic."}
{"text":"They get 5 stars for the only thing I have ever had there. Every single time I have to get the Pizza Nortena. It is out of this world. It is meant to be an appetizer but we get it to go and have it for dinner."}
{"text":"Large cavernous noisy place.  Food is okay with large portions.  Service varies on the day."}
{"text":"Good Mexican food, and service was good as well.  This place is tucked back in a hard to find area.  It offers a nice change from the traditional cheesy Mexican decor you normally find.  Large amount of food for the lunch size portions."}
{"text":"Was not greeted at the front so we just sat at the bar.
- took 5 min to get a drink order.
- ordered ground beed taco asked if it was deep fried she said yes...... Lied it came out like Taco Bell shell from Walmart.

- ordered cheese crisp cheese was cold and rubber and didn't even string a bit... Aka soggy!
- red chile bowl and guac was decent. 
- hot red salsa has great flavor. Poor presentation on the salsa. ... The bowls are big enough to stick my pinky in. 

BEER---- worst comment about this place... Draft beer is luke warm. And the bartender responds our lines are hot in the summer..the time beer is drank the most..poor engineering figure that shit out!"}
{"text":"Love their all day Monday happy hour!  Best cheese crisp I've had in a long time
Tacos are yummy too"}
{"text":"The Pizza Nortena is MOST DEF a fam favorite for us!!!!! Can't go wrong at AA's!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for years, but have been slacking lately... so I returned a couple of weeks ago. I was craving a chicken taco salad, and remembered how great theirs was. It is served in a tortilla bowl, and while I suppose you could eat the bowl, I don't... and go straight for the chicken...and there is plenty of chicken.. which is quite filling. It is shredded chicken on top of fresh greens, cheese, tomato, and a black olive or two. I had the italian dressing with my salad and my friend had the jalapeno ranch. We were both happy. The chips are hot and crispy, and the salsa is good. While I normally go during the week around happy hour time, I went on a Sunday afternoon. The service is great, the place is nice, and the bathrooms are clean, My favorite server was always Myra...but I'm not sure is she is there any longer.I will have to go back and check!"}
{"text":"My husband introduced me to Ajo Al's and it's become one of my favorite Mexican food restaurants in AZ! Love their salsa and the menu food is always fantastic. The service is good and fast. We had my husband's birthday dinner here and they were great about accommodating our large group."}
{"text":"Mmmm!  You can never have too many chips!  We love to sit in the bar where the action is.  I usually order the Pollo Fundido- always hot and extra cheesy.  If you are a regular they anticipate your order and the service is fabulous.  Always ensuring your chips and salsa are full to the brim."}
{"text":"Our favorite Mexican food place here in Phoenix. It's a New Mexico style place so if you are looking for traditional style this isn't your place. We always get the Pollo con Queso. The spiced cream cheese is amazing.  Hot and fresh chips with salsa.  The mild salsa is a bit too sweet for me but I love their hot. Service is usually excellent."}
{"text":"First time try this place out for a friend birthday NOT impressed at all the service was not good the sever seems annoyed that a few of us mentioned that our cheese crips where cold, tacos where super oily, someone didn't get their food. It was mentioned to the sever who basically blamed the kitchen never apologized. It would have been different if she gave the heads up as to what was going on with the food. 

I'm only giving this place 2 stars because the margaritas were good but this place deserves 1  for the bad service and food quality."}
{"text":"I have been in the industry for years and I really don't like giving reviews like this. I really enjoy the food and have been here many times over the years, but the service I received tonight was bad and it was only a to-go order. I understand the restaurant was very busy for a Thursday night, but I tried calling four times and never got an answer. When I informed the manager who took my order once I arrived he just shrugged and said 'It's busy'. The food came out in a timely manner. When I arrived back to collect my order, there was no hostess/host at the front door for at least three minutes. Once I was greeted, the service was very impersonal. I am just disappointed with my experience and I am glad I took the food to-go. I really enjoy the food here, and I really hope that this review doesn't fall on deaf ears. Service really needs to improve, even on unusually busy nights."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with my hubby and friends. Food was decent, but nothing out of this world as some other reviewers mentioned. The waitress was great hence the rating I gave of 3 Stars. The chips and salsa were good, I preferred the mild salsa to the spicy one, it was just too spicy. As for the meal, I had the taco salad with ground beef. It was good, but I would not call it a salad. It was basically a LOT of toppings and a little lettuce. Also the strange addition of spinach in the \"lettuce\" part was weird to me. This was the first time I had spinach in a taco salad. It was probably just part of the mix they used, but it did not feel authentic to me. It was okay but the taco shell was on the greasy side and there was a pool of water on the bottom of my plate under the shell. Not sure where that came from, so once I saw it I was done eating. I probably would not order it again. My hubby got the triple steak tacos. He said they were okay, but REALLY spicy and he likes a little heat. He said the spice made it so he could not really taste much else after the first bite. So I guess neither of us would order what we did again. We may go back and try something else, but given neither of us liked our dishes much we probably won't. The atmosphere was great, but the food was lacking."}
{"text":"The food is good, but my favorite thing about the place is the art.  I know I'm weird, but they really do have some great pieces to peruse as you nibble those chips and salsa.  

While this isn't my #1 Mexican spot, it's location has a been a great center meeting point with friends.  The food is never disappointing and service has always been good.  Very good actually.  Oh the stories I could tell about our friend doing some super heavy flirting with one of the waiters.  Though at that level it's hardly even flirting anymore.  More like a direct offer.  But anyhow... He handled it smoothly as silk.  This would lead me to guess they have a pretty good bar, which my friend was enjoying of course."}
{"text":"Every year on my uncle's birthday (December 31st) my entire extended family (and usually some friends) goes to Ajo Al's.  

Every year my Father (or one of my uncles) gets me to split a giant (GIANT) plate (really enormous platter pan) of nachos.

Every year there are at least 20 of us.

Every year the food is good and we have an amazing time.


The menu is expansive, but not overwhelming, so anyone can find something he or she likes (even if you don't care for Mexican food, you can find something more American...without this place feeling like an Applebees...because it certainly doesn't).

The service is not always the best (always nice, but sometimes slow), ESPECIALLY if they sit you on the patio (they usually forget about you there).

I only go there about twice or three times a year, but it certainly isn't because it isn't delicious.  Definitely looking forward to it this year!"}
{"text":"Met family for a late lunch and had a great time. The service was very good, our waitress was very attentive but we were probably the only ones in the restaurant. We started with the bean and queso dips with flour tortillas which we all enjoyed. The flour tortillas are freshly cut and fried and delicious. A nice treat if you enjoy flour tortillas over corn. My husband and son-in-law liked their Margaritas which they had the bartender make to their specifications. My daughter enjoyed her mini chimi's and I had the smoked brisket tacos which were very good but could have had a little more meat on them. The hot sauce that accompanies it it very hot and tasty. My mother had a plain shredded beef burro which was a good size and very moist. The down side was that although it tasted good going down everything seemed to be more salted than it should be which resulted in being very thirsty and swollen after we left."}
{"text":"There are a lot of good Mexican food spots here in AZ... so much so that you really have to do something great or unique in order to stand out from the crowd of other Mexican restaurants. Ajo Al's is good... but it isn't quite good enough to leave a lasting impression or warrant return visits. 

First off I have to give the place high marks for their décor; the place has a fun western feeling vibe. The booths all have strips of cow hide and are adorned with old time western movie posters among other things. I could see this being tacky in certain circumstances, but it works here. The tortilla chips came out nice and warm and the salsa was flavorful... definitely not bad to munch on while waiting for the main dish to arrive. We tried the Taco Del Mar plate (fish tacos) and a combination platter which included a taco, green chile tamale and a chile relleno. Everything was pretty good, but as I mentioned above it just didn't have that 'wow' factor. It was just one of those meals that 'met expectations' but didn't go above and beyond in any way. The same could be said about the service... it was passable but not anything above average. I'd be happy coming here again if the circumstances were right... I just feel like the food needs a bit more pizzazz and maybe some more distinct flavors/dishes to set them apart from the crowd. For example maybe they could have some chef specials that you couldn't find anywhere else... rather than having the majority of their menu taken up with the usual suspects (tacos/tostada's, etc... while they're good reliable Mexican dishes, it'd be nice to have more adventurous options like some of the higher end Mexican spots offer). 

Alo Al's is definitely worth trying at least once, I just wouldn't expect anything too different than the usual Mexican staples. They'd be on to something if their menu was as fun as the décor."}
{"text":"Place is run by gossiping high-schoolers.  And what's even greater is you get to listen to all their petty drama while they hang out at the bar after their shift.

Name literally translates to \"Garlic Al's\" however its really named after a city in Arizona... not the herb, very disappointing.

Other then that, pretty standard Mexican."}
{"text":"Go here for happy hour... which I believe is until 6:30pm? Great deals on drinks and the food selection isn't too shabby either. 

We (me & the  BF) ordered the chicken quesadilla per recommendation of the bartendress- great recommendation. That lil pocket of deliciousness is STUFFED with chicken and cheese plus you get all the naughty fixin's on the side (guac, sour cream, salsa...) as well.

All of the other food is still your standard, delicious Mexican... still very reasonably priced.

Ditching your vehicle is very convenient, plenty of parking in the back. Air conditioning is always 'full-blast.' Can order pitchers of margs frozen or on the rocks during happy hour.  

Couldn't ask for more on a 115 degree day :)"}
{"text":"Ordered steak fajitas which were very tough. Both the side servings of retried beans and rice were bland.  Overall there was a lack of favor as it seems their recipes do not allow for some spices.  A little cumin in the beans would make a huge difference   The rice was the most bland.  The  quantity was great but this is no trip to flavor town."}
{"text":"Has gone down hill since I've been going... The last straw was the change of the nachos... They now suck and they used to be my favorite in the valley!! Smaller, less toppings, worse tasting! Hopefully the change back!"}
{"text":"This is my second time at this location. First time was at a wedding dinner for my son several years ago before I was on Yelp.
This time it was for my mother-in=laws birthday. We wanted a place people could meet and wish her a happy birthday. 
They seated us in the room in the back that has one open side. This is the same place we had the wedding dinner.
We had a great time and everyone enjoyed their food.; We have three grandsons and they had a great time running around as we were the only people on this patio. 
The service was good and some came out to make sure we had everything we needed. 
Everyone had a good time. This will be a place we will surely come to visit again especially when we get our family together."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place when dining there. But, we don't get to do that very often. We have 4 kiddos, so we tend to order and pick up more often for a better dining experience. Lol   The last 4 times we have ordered by phone for pick up, there has ALWAYS been a problem with the order. Anywhere from missing 2 entire meals, to missing sides of beans or rice, to no chips and salsa and even wrong dinner order orders. I am so frustrated with them. Every time we call, they just say oops, we'll replace it next time. I've officially given up with Ajo Al's. Sad to say it, but they can only screw up so many times before losing my business. And unfortunately, they don't do enough to make up for their mistakes."}
{"text":"Haven't been in 10 years.  Ordered a Carne Asada burrito, received a Chorizo &Egg one. It will probably be another 10 years before i try again."}
