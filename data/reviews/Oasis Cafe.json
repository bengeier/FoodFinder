{"text":"This place is an old favorite of mine.  Maybe I haven't been to enough hookah joint, but I appreciate the smoke, food and dancing. 
I think Mr. K is tripping saying that he can't tolerate 19 year olds or Ja Rule. Ja isn't my favorite either, but come on Bee, are you that old and crotchety that you can't stand a bit of loud music? If that's the case why don't you get the 30-somethings at work to chip in and rent a conference room at the holiday inn and rent a hookah for the day. 

Alternatively, if you are really tripping about Ja Rule that much you should quit whatever job you have and go and work for Interscope, (Tony Yayo is gettin gold). I mean, really! Plus a Duran Duran reference, really?!"}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean food , Great customer service , highly recommended .
If you like to smoke the hookah they also have it"}
{"text":"Great hookah selection, tasty authentic Lebanese cuisine, full bar, and fantastic service. Imad (server) is always on top of his game and will make sure you are more than satisfied with your experience at Oasis. Come here to end your night out with friends or stop in earlier to relax and get a light buzz, either way you will be glad you chose this place over any other hookah destination."}
{"text":"To say that I'm quite a hookah connoisseur would be an understatement. First off, service is excellent. \"Cort\" I believe her name was, did a fab job making sure we were taken care of. The hookah unfortunately was not something I would recommend to an actual hookah fanatic. I ordered Al-Fakher watermelon mint and what I got was far from it. Neither watermelon mint or premium Al-Fakher tobacco. Boo :( Asides that, great service, great DJ and sound system. Perfect for a relaxing night out over the weekend.

Note: good hookah is never served in plastic pipes. Just saying."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Love coming here for a hookah or  food. The staff is friendly, always willing to talk and get to know you as a person. Order some gyros and ask Sean or Alex for a special hookah mix!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place negative zero stars I would.  Went here with a couple friends to eat, drink, and of course hookah.  The food was horrible and the hookahs are soooooo old and shitty!!!!  Do not waste your time going here. The decor needs to be updated, pillows that are in the seating area have stains on them....gross!!!!"}
{"text":"Spent 4 days in PHX.  Went to 3 different Hookah lounges.  This one beats them all. PHX has a few locations but they are mostly very young college hang outs who offer little in terms of ambiance, food or drinks.  This one topped each one I found.  The owner is great. Mae the waitress is awesome.  The Hookah is good, the crowd at happy hour is mellow and by Midnight is a great club.  Good mix of music and nice, clean surroundings."}
{"text":"WHO THE EFF PLAYS MOTHER-EFFING JA RULE WHILE I'M TRYING TO EAT MY MOTHER-EFFING HUMMUS? 

Yeah, this joint totally brings out the ghetto-yet-still-self-censoring brown man in me. 

All I can say is Oasis Cafe was a let down of insanely massive proportions. I remember wanting to go here early last year when it was at its old location on Apache, where I looked in once on a Friday night as I was leaving Cafe Istanbul and saw Moroccan drummers going at it and everyone clapping and dancing. \"Awesome,\" I thought, \"Must check this place out!\"

Well, the time had finally come, almost 2 years later. Even had another friend meet me there to check it out. Except no Moroccan drummers in sight. Decent looking place inside for the most part - trying to replicate Middle Eastern lounge style, even though the big screen TV was a little distracting (albeit showing Arabic pop videos).

However, it became very apparent that Oasis Cafe's core clientele wasn't going to be thirty-something people looking for a great meal to eat, but forlorn 19-year olds wanting to sit back and ponder their Gen Y existence while blowing strawberry scented puffs of hookah smoke. And still, I didn't mind this - I understand what the local Tempe market is supposed to be like (all hookahs, all the time), but that doesn't excuse Oasis Cafe from:

1) FOOD. Dry chicken shawarma and thin, just-there hummus. I ate my food and didn't think much of it one way or another. The zaatar (thyme/oregano/sesame) pita for appetizer was good, but there's really no way to screw that up. Given how much attention they put into their website, you'd think that would transfer over to their food, but this was not the case. Haji Baba will give you way more food for about the same quality for $4 less. 

That made me a little upset, but not as upset as the...

2) MUSIC. 

Ja Rule. 

Are you kidding me? No seriously, are you kidding me? Who the hell plays Ja Rule in 2007? Actually, establishments should be shut down for playing Ja Rule no matter what year it is. This was a really sad case of the owners thinking, \"Everyone in here is 19. Let's play hip-hop and R&B REALLY, REALLY LOUD because that's what they obviously want. They're practically clamoring for it. Look at them. Pining for Akon in that cloud of smoke.\"  And so we heard a rare Arabic pop song at regular volume but were mostly subjected to the aforementioned MOTHER EFFING JA RULE and Fiddy and Rihanna and all of them at maximum volume. Or actually way past maximum volume for a restaurant. The music choice just didn't make any sense. Here we were trying to eat Middle Eastern food, several others were just chilling with their hookahs (even though they were 19) - so what mandated \"In Da Club\" at 5000 decibels? It's Sunday night. No one's dancing. Everyone's mellowed out. I don't get it.

Our server was nice and courteous, I'll give him that, but overall the place was not one I'm going to head back to anytime soon. I'm really bummed about that fact and that I'm only giving it two stars, because I had such high hopes for it, but man, Ja Rule. That just kills me. However, at least they didn't play that song he did with JLo,  because I would have caused some serious but not-so-threatening damage, like knocking over my table a la \"Hungry Like The Wolf\" video or something. 

Bah."}
{"text":"I'll have to go with Mr. K on this one, a definite pass.  There are three other hookah lounges all within a half mile of Oasis and they are all worlds better than this one.  Go to Urban Cafe or even King Tuts, just anywhere but here. 

The food is mediocre, nothing stood out one way or the other.  The music was a little annoying, but I'm not really into pop music or hip-hop, but I suppose people who are would enjoy it.  However, the service is absolutely terrible.  I've been there twice and on both occasions the (extremely late) delivery of food saved me from walking out the door.  Their hookahs are not good, and you practically have to tackle an employee if you want more coals.

Save yourself the frustration and go to Urban Cafe or King Tuts.  Urban is a bit more for the mediterranean loving, less-frills crowd.  Tuts if you still like your hip-hop and being surrounded by ASU students."}
{"text":"Very cool hookah bar open until 4am. Cheap drinks ($8) and good music.  Cons: small, not enough tables, and you can't hear the music outside."}
{"text":"We were seated by someone and then never attended to. Waited about 5 minutes while the staff hung out chatting across the way. We got up and left. No one said a word. They were not even busy."}
{"text":"This place is open after hours, has amazing hookah, and great service! One of the only two great hookah bars in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Was looking for a different place than Pita House for good Middle Eastern food. Accidentally found this place on Grubhub....HOW LUCKY WAS I?? i wanted to pick up food, so I called and ordered the chicken kabob plate. When I drove there, it was a little hard to find because I didn't see a name on the business...when I walked in, it looked like just a hookah bar. BUT THE FOOD...OMG. I live in Chicago surrounded by award-winning M.E. restaurants, and this food was as good or better than any of them! I will return, to be sure!"}
{"text":"Recent AZ Central food inspection article said severed goat heads were found in the kitchen"}
{"text":"Very friendly owner and good quality hookah. Felt right at home. I will definitely be back here. Short review yelp wants more blah blah."}
{"text":"Had a fun night here.  I haven't been to a hooka bar in 10 years!  We went for drinks and hooka.  Staff was friendly, decor is nice.  They are a bit pricey but I guess that can be expected in old town!"}
{"text":"I had an excellent time here with all my friends, family, and randoms sitting close by. It was a very simple come in they check ID and if you want to find a place and sit down you can or you can just stand by the bar. We found a table and sat down and ordered 2 hookahs and some drinks and just enjoyed ourselves our waitress or whatever they call it there she was very nice and fast and I had no problems with her. Everyone here is chill laid back and everyone just has a good time to some middle eastern music or like 30 minutes of English haha. The hookah was good lasted us a long time which I was very shocked because a lot of these places don't really care and you get what you get but this was excellent. The bathroom is only one person so when it's busy you know you'll be waiting for a while. Also their is a security guy at the bathroom that tells you when to go in and out I have no idea what that was for but he was there all night. Place is nice, hookah was good, and the people are excellent. If you want to have a good time I suggest coming here."}
{"text":"Hookah was harsh from the jump. Asked to have it replaced. Didn't like it at all. Choked on every pull."}
{"text":"Great local spot conveniently located in the heart of the local clubs we crossed from the W hotel after cocktails and found good food came into friendly staff a comfortable environment with heated lamps on the patio... the hookah was checked frequently and the food was brought out quickly enjoyed the margaritas and will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Came in here tonight after The W Hotel/Living Room drove me away for a number of reasons. This place is across Buckboard from the W. Had never been in before. It's a hookah lounge/Mediterranean restaurant/pub. Ashley was my server, and she was very nice for taking care of the whole place on a somewhat slow Sunday night. I had the falafel wrap with the fries. Very tasty. Prices are very affordable, by Old Town standards. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Really nice Place, Just got remodeled, Great service the Hookahs are really good and the only place in Scottsdale with all the Good Flavors. Really good food authentic  taste for a great price. I would definitely recommend this place to relax and bring your friends. Looking forward to coming back"}
{"text":"Sorry guys this one might be a bit rough. First off I want to say that Abraham was very nice and the reason for the extra star and not a one star on this review. I just can't give it more than that. I also want to mention I'm half middle eastern and this was a massive disappointment. 

We ordered hookah and a bunch of food and drinks. Let's start with the hookah. It was ok. It got harsh pretty quick. But that's not the issue. We wanted vodka in the base. It is on the menu and then they said, \"it's on the menu but we don't do it anymore\" ummmmm help me understand why don't you update your menu then?

Ok moving on to the food. We had the chicken wings, hummus with chicken, and grape leaves. The chicken wings were terrible. Also why is a middle eastern spot serving chicken wings. That makes no sense unless it would be with middle eastern flavors and make a twist on it. The hummus was bland and the chicken was cold with little flavor. I'm not sure what's going on with it but it wasn't right. The grape leaves. Usually I like them hot in temp but these were cold, ok no big deal. They tasted like there were in the fridge or wrapped a long time ago. Not good. 

Again Abraham was nice, but I just can't get over the food and hookah experience. Not sure who is cooking in the kitchen and why the menu isn't updated, but I feel a change is needed. Unfortunate because this is a great location and I feel like it needs to step up their game."}
{"text":"We came on a sunday... its memorial weekend and the music is so low and we are not having a good time... so boring... so so boring..."}
{"text":"This place really isn't bad for a hookah bar. If you're looking for a place to eat, I wouldn't recommend coming here. Grab a bite before hookah! (The food isn't terrible, but the prices for what you get just isn't worth it-- almost $9 for a falafel wrap with 3 small falafels inside). Hookah is moderately priced as well, about $16. Other than that there isn't much to rave about. The service is very so-so, and the atmosphere is a little weird. Neon lights flashing around all the time isn't the most relaxing, but it's not terrible either."}
{"text":"Upscale hukah cafe . Good music, good vibes with comfortable seating that suits a hukah lounge."}
{"text":"I go quite often and just recently have tried their food! Love the staff, music and the hooka choices that they have. Must visit."}
{"text":"My new favorite hookah spot. I would def recommend getting there early, they get super busy."}
{"text":"When we came out to AZ we gave this state two or three stars cause there was not much to do. But after this lounge experience, is been upgraded to 4 or 5 stars!  Worth the 6 hour drive from San Diego. Afterall, it's not everyday that you come across a place that has a full bar, food (really delicious chicken kabob) and every flavor of hookah you can think of.  The service is exceptionally great! Alex and the entire serving staff were absolutely delightful and hospitable. Def recommend to any shisha conneseuer."}
{"text":"I didn't know what the hell to make of Oasis. All I know is that I won't be back and if a friend wants Middle Eastern food I wouldn't tell them to come here. The food was fine but Mr K pretty much sums up why the rest of it makes no sense. The contrast between the website and the place is pretty shocking."}
{"text":"I'm from NorCal...and this place is amazing!!! Great environment...great staff...and the DJ plays some awesome beats!!! 

Sara was my waitress the first night, Sabrina was my waitress...the 2nd night...and they're both attentive and really nice. The guy is consistent on when your coals get low...and also really nice!!!

Two nights in a row!!!! So worth it!!!! I'd come back for sure, if and when I'm in town again!!!

Didn't really order food except we ordered fries and they were bomb!!! Didn't get a photo of the fries bcus we ate them way too quickly!!!"}
{"text":"I was visiting from LA and first tried the PITA place which turned out to be a dump as far as service goes.... but I was surprised with OASIS.  Not too shabby... Good service....Friendly, and good hookah."}

{"text":"I was there last night 2-18-16 , hooka was ok , service was ok .. The reason I'm giving them 1 start it's because my bill was 29 dollars witch it's fine I left 5 dollar cash tip cash and pay the rest with my debit , today I check my account and see the charged me 35 , the associate Imad add 5 more dollar tip .."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place! Hookah is amazing! Staff is amazing! Food is amazing! DJ is amazing! Need i say more?!"}
{"text":"Came here on  Saturday and Sunday night during a trip to Scottsdale with the family for a 49er vs. Cardinals game.  Was packed Saturday but still had plenty of room to chill and relax with out feeling crowded.  Nice outdoor area next to street so you can people watch while you do your thing.  Sunday was quiet and not packed at all.  Server was awesome and made recommendations on hookaah flavors and checked in often to ensure we were good.  Excellent Service!  He recommended the chocolate mint which was awesome."}
{"text":"This establishment makes a sad attempt to be \"high end\", while in reality being a hole in the wall with outrageous prices.

The Hookah (1/5): I am convinced that the only people who return here for hookah really do not understand good hookah. This was one of the worst I've ever had, terrible tasting tabacco that hardly gets obscured by flavor additives and the hookah apparatus itself is entirely plastic. Don't mean to sound pretentious when i say this: I've smoked hookah all over the world including the Middle East and this was very disappointing.

The Drinks (1/5): let's start with the water. The tap water they bring takes like it came out of a sewage pond. Can't they install a filter? Seems like a very low cost investment to keep decent water. Then water is served in plastic cups, the kind you'd find at Cici's pizza. As far as the drinks go, they charge 7 bucks for a beer! Any place that charges this much for a beer should not be serving water in cheap plastic cups and serving cheap plastic hookah. 

The ambiance (3/5): the ambiance did not match to the price of the drinks either. It was boring and bland, nothing really interesting. 

The service (3/5): this one was interesting. While picking out a beer, I asked if they have a pilsner or a hefeweizen...the waitress was clueless. This is not a difficult question if one works in the restaurant or bar business. Her only response was I just came from LA and don't know this stuff. To summarize, I had to settle for a Dos Equis. Otherwise she was reasonably attentive..

Don't waste your time or money here. This place is not worth either."}
{"text":"Hookah was decent. Service was a little slow, but we were shoved in the back. It was a busy Saturday night so understandable. We had originally tried I-mad and had a terrible experience which we than left there to come here. Nice atmosphere. Kind of wished the misters would hit you on the inside instead of the passerbys on the sidewalk. Overall good time."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, GREAT HOOKAHS and Grown & Sexy place to visit while visiting SCOTTSDALE AZ"}
{"text":"I can't believe I hadn't been here before yesterday!  Talk about a hidden gem!  I was taking a friend around to cross stuff off her \"List of Stuff to do Before the World Ends\" and smoking a hookah happened to be on it.  Therefore I googled places nearby us and Oasis popped up.

As soon as we got there the guy at the door welcomed us in with a smile and opened the door for us and once inside the waitress/bartender helped us pick a table and took our drink orders.  We decided to get the peach hookah and an order of the Hummus and Pita Deluxe with beef.  The food was delicious and the hookah was great!  The staff was awesome the entire night as well.  Everyone kept checking on us to see if we needed anything and they would just stop and chat with us as well.  One guy was even helping my friend try to make smoke circles!  I definitely love that they're open until 4 am on Fridays and Saturdays too because it's always nice to have somewhere to wind down after all the bars close!"}
{"text":"I had a great experience at this hookah bar. I heard that they were not good but me and my friends wanted to go and Oasis was the only one that was open at the time. Driving to it was great because I love the location in old town Scottsdale.
We went in and were immediately helped, and we ordered cups of water and strawberry and peach hookah. They came back with the hookah pretty quickly and it was very smooth. The flavors were great and the combination was perfect. We then decided we were hungry and ordered some french fries. The portion was pretty good, the three of us shared it and we were content. The french fries were pretty good, i might add.
The lady who helped us was friendly, talkative and relatable, and very accommodating. Later on a guy also came around to switch our coals so that the hookah wouldn't get harsh.
The atmosphere was great, there were lasers and couches and a full bar. It was dimly lit which is perfect for a hookah bar. It wasn't too loud when we went. There was some kind of Middle-Eastern or Indian music playing which was interesting.
I should also say that, being germaphobic, I made sure to ask if they cleaned their hookahs. The guy told me that he personally cleans the whole thing, and they even give each person a sealed disposable plastic mouthpeice.
Last but not least, their prices were great.
All in all a great experience, I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"First off, if you go here for the food, you've blown it. Not to say the food isn't good, it is, but if you're going to hooters for the wings, you've already failed. We stayed a block or two away from this shisha bar with a kitchen tucked in behind the W and near Mint, and wound up smoking/eating/drinking there several times over the course of the week. It became our last call spot, golfcarting there after a night at Gilligans or Bungalow. Sit outside, smoke some shisha, watch the Persians smoke and play cards and snap quips at each other in farsi...it's an experience. The food was good enough that we even got it to go and munch late, late night, back at the ranch. Dogfish 90 minute in bottles was all I remember, but that's a barometer for a decent beer selection if I've ever seen one. Definitely a cool spot."}
{"text":"Great hookah (also offers ice hoses and fruit bowls). Great service. Food is good but I haven't eaten a lot of it. Drinks are good. Music is great. Atmosphere is good. It's a nice place to escape the chaos of the nearby clubs haha."}
{"text":"Felt awkward walking in. Friendly bar staff. Awkward ambience because were not middle eastern. Middle Eastern music is all that plays, drinks are okay. They forget our order.. Hookah is great!"}
{"text":"this place used to be really good. But now it is absolutely disgusting and ghetto. $25 bucks for shitty hookah and shitty service? No thanks.

And overweight employees in booty shorts? I'd rather keep my appetite. ew."}
{"text":"I used to live in AZ and would frequent Oasis and every time I go back to visit family and friends I always stop by. This is the go to place for hookah in AZ. They make great flavored hookah's and are happy to share and mix as many options as requested. They take pride in their hookah and their food is surprisingly delicious. They have music some nights and live entertainment too so be sure to check it out. Full bar and hookah til late also make this spot a frequent after club place to go."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite spot in AZ. Always have great music playing, has a full food menu, and extra good hookah. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for my birthday. The food was decent but the hookah sucked. We sat outside so we were pretty much forgotten. The waitress came to our table two times total. Once to take our order and once to bring our food. She also got my husbands order wrong. No one changed our charcoal, no one asked if we needed anything. We waited 30 minutes for our check and no one came so we went inside to pay. Terrible service, decent food, and bad hookah. I don't recommend wasting your time or money coming here."}
{"text":"Came here with five friends. My friend had his passport but not ID we came at 5pm on. Friday for hookah and sodas. Not to drink. 

They wouldn't expect his passport as ID? Which is odd to me seeing how his 21. Then they refused to continue to serve my friend and I even after he agreed to drive home for his ID. 

First time being here and just left a bad impression. The waitress was rude off the bat and I just won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I'm writing this to WARN hookah lovers who may consider this place in the future. It was 1:45am when a group of 5 of us arrived on a Saturday night. We waited outside for 25 minutes before we were allowed to go inside after each paying a $5 cover. Upon entering, there was no table available. We waited for another 30 minutes inside but no luck, no table. When we tried to leave, the doorman (wearing a security shirt) refused to refund the $25 of cover. In addition to the loss of money, we also lost even more valuable time. Principally I'm against this and now encourage you to go to the other hookah bar half a mile away on Scottsdale and Indian school called Pita House. It's open til 5am and probably won't scam you."}
{"text":"I had a great hookah experience with a couple of friends.  Sara and Shawn kept the drinks and hot coals flowing.  The hookah had a cantaloupe bowl with long-lasting coconut shell charcoal cubes.  For some extra fun, request a bubble blower!  The location is excellent as it is walking distance from many bars and the W Hotel."}
{"text":"There is a African American chick who works here who is a racist and super rude and I would highly recommend not visiting this establishment as long as they have terrible cocktail servers. Worst customer service ever."}
{"text":"This was just an awful experience. Service is slow. They seemed to be running around like chickens with no heads with not many customers. Hookah was ok had better. The food was awful. No flavor at all! Very sad for it being a middle eastern joint. A friend had a pizza for $16. Wal mart frozen pizza would have been better. And the fiasco with splitting checks four ways seemed to be a challenge.   Sooo not worth it. I-mad has way better food and service!! I'll be damned if I let a group of friends drag me to that dump again."}
{"text":"I don't normally give bad reviews for places I visit just one time, but my experience here was so bad I have to say something. First off, the management is awful. The owner is extremely rude and does not care about his customers, and by my observation his employees either. I saw one girl ask for a break and the owner refused and waved his hand at her to go away while he continued to smoke his hookah. I proceeded to ask the girl how long she had been working without a break and she said 10 hours, not even a water break. I went to go to the bathroom and saw a girl walk out of the bathroom with what looked like illicit drugs and a rolled up dollar bill. When I was walking out with my wife I saw all the security guards watching porn on one guy's phone together. Overall terrible service, vibes, and dirty environment at this joint. Much better food and hookah bars in the area to go to rather than wasting your time and $$$ here."}
{"text":"I was visiting from Orange county and decided to take a break and have a hookah.   This place was perfect.   It was quiet, cool and had a great atmosphere.   The waitress was excellent.   She constantly came by to check on us.  I would recommend the Oasis to anyone who is looking for a local hookah lounge in Scottsdale."}
