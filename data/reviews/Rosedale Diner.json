{"text":"We took some friends for dinner and really enjoyed the evening. The patio is just perfect with trees and lights. Food was great specially the gnocchi- it was the best I've ever had with delicious flavours. Also loved the Israeli salad - simple and very refreshing with just the right amount of dressing. Our server was courteous and made nice recommendations. Will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Haven't been there in years and will never go there again. When you pay $14 for bacon and eggs would it be too much to ask for a smile , to have the server bring you the jam you asked for ,  to offer you a refill or to peruse the room to see if any one needed service. instead  the 3 servers were huddled behind the counter in conversation. I finally got someones attention and got my jam ( not by my server ) and I finally got my second cup of coffee ( again not by my server ) and was charged for it. So for $70 for 2 including tax and tip I got minimal service average food and a bad experience . Will return to Carens up the street (Yonge St) for a much better eating experience."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. I went to this restaurant after seeing it on tv and the food was terrible. The fries tasted like they had been fried at least 5 times and were definitely more than 1 day old, the food was overly greasy and tasteless. Not to mention it was over $100 for 4 people to order food they didn't even eat. Do not go here. EVER"}
{"text":"If you are looking for good ribs, this is the place to get them. The staff is great, good service. The Caesar salad was not good, though."}
{"text":"I've been to Rosedale Diner twice. Both times the food was pretty lackluster and the service was questionable.  The first time I went was for their Winterlicious prix fixe with a girlfriend of mine, and the experience was so-so. The food wasn't that memorable (though I do remember it was pretty salty and way too saucy) and our server was a little strange- he started trying to sell us on his idea for high end women's luxury purses (even stated how much they would be selling for, what kind of clientele he was aiming at...). It was a little weird when he asked us for our e-mails so that he could get some ideas from us, and maybe we could sketch up some ideas and not to worry because he wouldn't sell our sketches to anybody...?? Not really appropriate for someone to be doing that in their other place of work to customers who are there for lunch. Service during the meal wasn't that attentive either, but I excused this since it was a pretty busy time.  The second time I went was a week ago, for a Saturday brunch with family. I thought it'd be a cute spot for us, and hopefully the service would be a little better. It was actually worse this time. Most of the staff looked tired/hungover and not in the mood to serve anyone at all. I felt like I was in a restaurant on a college campus the day after a huge bender. I asked for the tea selection and requested for an iced tea, basically just brewed hot tea, with ice. The response was \"Um, we actually HAVE our own iced tea.\" I told her that I didn't want that, and if she could please just make this. Reluctantly she took the tea bags and came back later with the tea bags in water and ice. Any server should know that if you're going to make iced tea this way, you have to brew the tea for a few minutes first to actually impart ANY flavour! When I told one server she looked back at the barista and said to us \"Uhh, well I didn't make this she did, I.....dunno WHAT she was doing I'll go ask?\" This took another half an hour. They'd also forgotten the coffee for my grandpa, and the chicken on my mom's salad. The place wasn't even busy! The food was overpriced for what was offered, and the service was horrendous. Our experience was topped off by the waitress accidentally dropping the used cutlery in my mom's lap. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Like Bentley's famous critique of Pope's Iliad (\"pretty ... but you must not call it Homer\"), the Rosedale Diner is a cheerful establishment with some good food, but it takes a big stretch of the imagination to call it a diner. About the only thing that is diner-like is the aluminum on the facade. Once you get inside, the ambiance is cafe-like, especially in the trellised patio out back.  As if that weren't enough of a hint, they don't have \"fries\" at this \"diner,\" they have \"frites.\" The rest of the menu is suitably upscale, with prices to match. Even the modestly-sized (but quite tasty) avacado-tomato omlette with \"frites\" is about ten bucks. On the other hand, there are some nice touches that go with the uptown cache; for instance, they have very good rustic-style sugar cubes (you can put a real \"lump\" in your tea or coffee)."}
{"text":"Appeared on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives.  The duck poutine certainly delivered!"}
{"text":"It's just a neighborhood joint that's been around forever. It's small and cozy ad serves all the homemade stuff you crave every now and then. They do takeout and delivery through Restaurants On The Go. It's the kind of place you crave when it's freezing outside in the middle of December and you're stuck up by St. Clair and Yonge. it's a two minute cab ride from there and conveniently, right across the street from a giant LCBO that stays open late."}
{"text":"Fries were very greasy. The club sandwich was ok. The staff were slightly standoffish.  I probably won't come back."}
{"text":"I love this place! I had hummus with lamb and my friend had a seafood burger. Food was amazing and the staff is so friendly! It's a great place for brunch"}
{"text":"I like this place! The patio is really lovely and feels like a little oasis in the city. I love how when I was sitting back there, I could see the kitchen staff scurrying back and forth between the kitchen and upper levels of the building carrying fresh ingredients-- include the trellises and the lights, and it was a charming scene. The food is good but a little overpriced I think, unless you are getting burgers."}
{"text":"Love this place - it's one of our regulars.  Service is very friendly and well-paced (sounds like one person had a bad night a couple months back, but honestly we have never had any issues whatsoever).  We tend not to eat meat so the vegetarian and fish options are a big draw for us, but one of our sons recently had the cassoulet and it was utterly divine. I hadn't had cassoulet since my summer in Provence as a teen - sweet memories!  Everything is fresh and the portions are perfectly sized. As for the deserts, the sticky toffee pudding.....to die for. The back patio in the summer is also absolutely delightful. And a fist full of candy on the way out satisfies the 5 year-old in me. Reason I'm not giving them a 5 - check my other reviews, I just don't give 'em - I guess I'm still holding out!"}
{"text":"I'm glad I didn't read some of the previous negative reviews because my experience was pretty great. I came here with my gf during summerlicious and we couldn't have asked for a better lunch.  We came on a Thursday at around 1:00pm so it wasn't super busy and we were allowed to sit wherever we pleased. Our server was very friendly (young guy with a clean shaven head) and he made sure we were happy with our courses. We came the last year during summerlicious as well and had the same server.  As for the food, I had the duck pate to start, followed by a braised brisket sandwich with fries, and a rosewater panna cotta for dessert (Check out the pictures I added). For $20 a person, I thought it was damn good."}
{"text":"The food was tasty, but the portion size to cost ratio was at an all time low.  And service took forever in an empty diner.  You can do the math!  There must be better in the area!"}
{"text":"I was in the area and thought I might try the diner for a healthy lunch. The choices were quite limited and a bit trendy-most customers seemed to be going  more for your standard sandwich and shoe string fries.  So I decided to be different.  Incredibly hungry and without great thought, I ordered a dish that was a Morrocan Chick Pea vegan dish that was supposed to contain an array of vegetables,  but instead, ended up as mostly a hot chick pea stew-not anything as described on the menu and had mostly red and white chick peas that could have come right out of a tin.  The serving was tasty but quite a small portion for 20.00-it would have served as a light lunch to hold over for a more substantial meal.  The Pita was heated, and incredibly tough to chew.   The diner atmosphere is lovely with its quaint intimate space, and turn of the century details like the original ceiling.  But the tables are not for the large size by any means.  Duck your head when you descend to the basement to use the bathroom.    Anyhow, I was finished in about 5 minutes flat, and then realized that chick peas tend to cause gas and bloating for me, and this being a very small but crowded place, I rushed to pay and then ran out for fear they'd have to call a fire truck on me.    I'm not sure what the award winning dishes were that I should have picked-but the standard fries and sandwich did look better.    The waitresses were quite lovely and helpful, but I found the food highly overrated.for what it was.   Not terrible, just not great."}
{"text":"Food was great, but overpriced, in my opinion.  Don't be fooled by the name though, it's definitely not a diner."}
{"text":"Decided to have dinner here with an old friend. While it's been recommended,  I wasn't overly impressed. The wait staff were very impatient and tried to rush us to order. They seemed rather annoyed that we hadn't decided what we wanted as soon as we say down.   The food was warm and decently tasty,  although the cheese was slightly burned. The prices on the other dishes are very expensive for what you get.   I don't think I'll be back"}
{"text":"Randomly looked over to my left as I drove North on Yonge and found this cute little 50s-looking diner. It said it had a patio. I decided to check it out with my wife, after reading about some reviews about the Duck. Well. Seems people were right.   Firstly, the duck paté. Hot-DAMN. It's served in the same glass they set it into the fridge in, so it has that thin layer of fat on top. A very generous portion, mind you.  Then came the duck poutine. Having a little forethought, I decided to add (what I was to find is one of the best examples, in the city, of) kimchi. So did my wife.  Hands down, best poutine I've had all year. The fries were crispy, bordering in shoestring, but not enough to turn into spaghetti. The cheese was hand-made, served right; properly spread, evenly distributed and half melted when it got to me. Gravy was thick, but not chunky. All nestled on a PERFECTLY cooked bed of duck. Just... wow... Chef, my hat's off to you.  Not the cheapest menu, but well worth the experience. If only for that poutine."}
{"text":"Had a lovely lunch here - fresh and well-portioned with the most amazing hot sauce which they should bottle and sell!!!"}
{"text":"Had duck stew over fries for $18.  Nothing special. Seven people was $140 for lunch. Too expensive for burgers and pea meal bacon sandwiches."}
{"text":"I'm taking Decemburger into the backwoods, reviewing restaurants not found on the sanctioned list.  Think of me as a liburgeral, trying to promote equality of opportunity in the overheated Toronto market.  Given my mission this month, it was serendipitous when my faithful brunch companion Emily \"Could I have some cheese with my cheese please?\" H. suggested a burger instead of the usual weekend jumpstart.  Since reading the Rosedale Diner's claim that they made Toronto's Best Burger, I had been dying for an excuse to check the place out.  Sitting just outside Summerhill subway station, it's not surprising that this place is a little on the posh side.  My locally-raised, grass-fed, shiatsu-massaged* ground chuck burger was cooked to order, topped with Brie and avocado and came tucked into a pita instead of the usual bun.  On the side were shoestring fries with a little bit of toasted onion mixed in.  It cost me $19.    When you're paying this kind of money for a burger, it had better be done right and done well.  It had also better not be well-done.  While my meal was delicious, it wasn't exactly \"just right.\"  I had held high hopes for the Rosedale Diner, so this was a bit of a disappointment.  I'll start with the good news.  The patty was remarkably thick and incredibly juicy.  It had a tang of Worcestershire sauce (love!).  In short:  delicious.  The pita pocket it came in kept the bun from crowding out this hunk of meat - it got centre stage.  The fries were delicious; that bit of toasty onion in there was a nice touch.  Now for the bad news.  As noted, burgers here are cooked to order.  I asked for medium, and got medium-well (no pink, from what I could see).  Having paid $2.50 each for Brie cheese and sliced avocado on my $14 burger, I was disappointed to see a thin layer of Brie melted onto my beefy behemoth (Emily, too, was shorted on Swiss**).  While the pita pocket was a nice approach to understating the bun, it left little room for toppings and I found myself jamming avocado between pita and patty to the point where I could only use half of it.  Great idea, but needs improvement.  * Just kidding. ** I'm not just talking about the holes."}
{"text":"A lot of people seem to have a problem with this place including the word \"diner\" in it's name...it's a name, don't get too hung up on it. The food here is great. It's true that it takes a while and it's not the cheapest on Yonge street, but it's delicious, made with care, and largely local without being in your face about it.  Service is fine, it's small enough you can always catch someones eye, had a blue berry cheesecake that tasted strange, and it was quickly exchanged for a different dessert, no problem.  Charlotte S- no one cares about your spoiled Valentines day, and 2 ounces of goat cheese is plenty actually plenty on an appetizer salad."}
{"text":"The place is small and decorated for the neighborhood. The service was good and the food was excellent! Everything we tried had great flavor. The price was a little high, but good food is worth it. If you are looking for a bargain this may not be your place, but if you are looking for quality food in the Toronto area, I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Lovely dinner around my neighborhood!! Warm service, amazing food, and great ambiance.. Seats by the window are sweet spots~"}
{"text":"Loved it. A not miss for the area. Great food and even better atmosphere. Little pricy for French fries, but who isn't."}
{"text":"We ate here for an early dinner.    First, the food.  The hummus and and tajine were pretty good.  The poutine was tasty but salty, but that's probably fine because I doubt anyone who's health-conscious eats poutine more than one a year.  Now, the service. I took my parents here for their birthday dinner, and noted this fact both on Open Table and verbally to the restaurant staff when we arrived.  Nothing special was provided by the restaurant to my parents, not even a pastry with a candle stuck in it, or an obligatory \"happy birthday\".    Next, the restaurant got my order wrong, which may be based in part because the menu lists two separate dishes each containing duck confit. I wanted the duck confit with poutine, and instead I got the duck confit with market vegetables.  When I told the restaurant I got the wrong dish, no offer was made to bring me the correct dish.  I was then charged $10 for the side order of poutine that I had to order separately and should have received in the first place.  One has to wonder if this place runs by the \"never admit you're wrong\" credo.  Somewhat disappointing."}
{"text":"Just moved into the neighborhood and one of the first things on my list was to check out the local restaurants. This place was busy (which seems like a good sign) and their back patio is amazing.  But a lovely back patio does not a restaurant make.  The food is bland. bland. bland. In hindi there is a word - \"swad\". Swad means flavour, that taste at the back of your tonge, the flavours that make you smack your lips and close your eyes and proclaim \"damn thats good!\". This food had no swad. Not even a sw..   I got the chicken thigh sandwich - limp, not hot, kinda funny tasting chicken with some not so remarkable toppings. The bun was good.   My friend got the fish tacos. They were not tasty - very little fish (even though they say they take a whole fish steak and divide it amongst three tacos)  The service was okay. Friendly server but I will never come back. Id rather eat a dominos pizza."}
{"text":"The good: service was friendly, coffee refilled quickly.  Seats in the window are tiiiiight.  We aren't big people but we had a hard time fitting our tummies in.  Poached eggs were well poached, but placed one on top of another....a little strange.  Food overall was pretty good, just wasn't great enough to be a destination spot."}
{"text":"Meh is right. I have a place near me (Fanny Chadwicks) that has the same sort of vibe and prices- if I had to choose, I would rather go there."}
{"text":"I'm fairly sure that the 3-star reviews wanted to be 2-star reviews but they were being generous given the area. This is a subpar diner with above average prices.  that is all.  I would not choose to go here but it provides a nice alternative to more formal restos in the area.  Go to the rebel house. yeah..just don't.  I've seen group-buys for this before- which makes it just plain value (if say..you get 50% off)..not even good value."}
{"text":"I visited the Rosedale Diner last Thursday evening for a dinner date and was absolutely blown away! If there was ever a place in the city to feel welcome, the ambiance, cozy environment and service will make you feel really special - or right at home (just with wayyyy better food)!  Recommended by a friend, I knew there were going to be some phenomenal menu options - what I didn't know is that I would fall in love with everything I tasted that night.  We started out with the Duck Pate from the appetizer section, which was unlike any pate I've ever tried. It was creamy, smooth, perfectly balanced, and addictive... I could eat that breakfast, lunch, dinner and possibly even dessert.  Moving on to round two, we went big and ordered their 65 day aged steak. It was perfectly cooked (medium rare) and was a show stopper. If anyone has the opportunity to try it, one must!!!   Finally we finished the evening with a wonderful creme brulee topped with fresh raspberries! As a dessert comes first kind of person.... I loved every spoonful and would have eaten 5 more had I not been so full from the rest of our meal!  To sum it up, it was just a perfect evening and dinner at the Rosedale Diner. Spot on all the way! Can't wait to go back for more!"}
{"text":"When I first went to this place I just walked by and thought to myself \"cool, a cute little diner\", but when I saw the menu realized it's more of a mid-priced small bistro.    I ordered the burger with frites and it was pretty tasty but a little too pricey for a burger. They have an interesting list of toppings you can pay extra for to put on your burger, but at $3 per cheese slice(or something like that) not really worth it.    One good thing about this place is the pumpkin beer they have on tap. If your a beer drinker, you should definitely take a gamble and try it."}
{"text":"Was excited to try it for winterlicious because it was featured on diners drive ins and dives. Fun diner interior, friendly staff, but food fell short. We all tried something different, the duck pouting arrived in a bowl of gravy soup, we had to ask them to pour some gravy out and they agreed it was to much. Calamari was tasty, the fish and chips was a massive portion! And the burger looked delicious. The Brie with apple and pita was also yummy. The bowl I was recommended had chopped tomatoes and cucumber drenched in olive oil on top of hummus with pita. It could have been good, but there was too much olive oil. Desserts all looked delicious, I had the flourless chocolate cake and was very happy.  I would not say it is up to diners drive ins and dives standards, but still edible food"}
{"text":"My months-long hiatus from Yelp ends with this review! I may be a bit biased as I was finally meeting up with my twin Danielle P. after months of not seeing her. But I love Rosedale Diner. This is definitely not your typical diner. The food is a lot more upscale and drool worthy. It has a great, warm atmosphere. At one point, I was listening to some Jon Legend then mixed in with some generic reggae and I felt pretty peaceful. They had the cutest table in the window and although it's not the most practical, it was fun to sit there and chat, as the world went by. We decided on the burgers and I was interested to see how it would taste with a pita instead of a regular bun.   I don't know how long we waited for our food as I was talking and enjoying my twin's company. But it tasted delicious. The pita complimented the beef nicely and all the toppings I asked for were on the side so I could decide how little or how much I wanted. I added caramelized onions, fresh avocado and jalapenos to my order. I'm not an expert on fresh avocado, but it tasted really good altogether. The fries were delicious and lightly salted.   Our waiter was extremely nice and accommodating, letting us know that he could bring any condiment that wasn't listed on the menu. He didn't overcrowd us and they never rushed us out even hours after we had paid the bill. Icing on the cake? The waiter ran down the street after us when D forgot her umbrella there. Many little things that definitely made a difference on going back there again."}
{"text":"Over an hour for eggs over medium. 10 bucks for 2 eggs and 2 thin strips of bacon. Watched the server use her finger to mix horseradish into a Caesar. We were also ignored on multiple occasions. At least the black currant jam was delicious."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place. Love the Biggie Breakfast (hash browns cooked perfectly - where else can you find not-undercooked potatoes??) Double order peameal bacon, double bacon, 4slices of roast, Israeli salad (salad that could never be guilt-free?) and 3 eggs. ... Yum.   I love the old diner look and feel, and I totally love our waitress, Caitlin. Because she's pretty as spring morning, but  mostly because SHE HAS MOXIE (yeah I know, great word).  So do as I say:  come, eat, drink, enjoy repeat. If you're lucky some of the moxie might rub off on you."}
{"text":"Ah I am so sad to write this review, but it has to be written. I LOVE this place. I love the food, I love the patio, I love the BYOB on Sun and Mon...but the service is just SO awful. This past weekend I brought two friends to dinner there as they just moved to Rosedale. I was going on and on about what a wonderful place it is and we ended up having the worst time. Our waitress, Erin, was possibly the snarkiest woman I have ever met. We all came in at different times and she greeted each of us with a rude comment. ie - my husband came in and said \"I am meeting some friends out back\" to which she replied \"good luck with that.\" What on earth does that mean?? She forgot part of our order and neglected us for our entire meal. We all wanted another beer at one point but after waiting 25 minutes decided to give up and get a drink down the street. Not only was it not busy - we were the only table at the time! I was so unbelievably disappointed. I love this place and have been coming here for years, but I just can't support horrendous behaviour anymore. Erin wasn't the only one - but by far the worst offender. When we were leaving, a couple came in and when they saw our waitress, they said \"Oh no, it's her.\" And they turned around and left. The owner needs to get it together and hire some decent staff. Goodbye Rosedale Diner...*tear*."}
{"text":"Back patio was nice, it was nice to be outside and in the shade. Insect traps was a plus. We didn't get that many insects bothering us.  Food was decent. The breakfast plate came with a touch of fruit on the side, which is nice to cleanse the breakfast grease.   Service was terrible though. The waiter wasn't attentive enough and a tad forgetful (e.g. asked if we wanted to get the coffee refilled, we answered yes, but he forgot to come by and refilled it).   The food was not spectacular enough to make up for the less than desirable service. Won't be dying to go back."}
{"text":"Dig, if you will, a picture of my Husband and I on Valentine's Day 2012.   If you choose to celebrate this Hallmarkiest of holidays, Valentine's Day puts a lot of pressure on one to impress. Just think: it's your one day of the year to stand in a lineup 30 people deep for a card she probably won't  remember a year from now and a stuffed animal she definitely won't like and to pay $90 for a dozen roses that might already be dead now, or at least dying.   Add to the mix that Valentine's Day is actually your wedding anniversary, your 2nd wedding anniversary and your first anniversary since your marriage that you haven't been pregnant.   Then, consider that your wonderful husband (who is observant enough to know that you love kitsch) plans an evening at the Rosedale Diner, to your surprise, complete with a babysitter for your 11 month old, a box of chocolates and all the V-Day fixin's.   Despite the fact that by virtue of your busy life which now includes a nearly-walking toddler, you are completely exhausted all the time, you are excited and harness the right attitude to slip on a dress and a pair of heels and go with the (surprise) flow. I checked the menu out online and it looked great. I was excited to try out the poutine, among other things.   When we walk in, everything kind of falls apart right away. I'll condense from here.   Our \"reservation\" really just meant that as soon as a table became available they would give it to us. Then, the regular menu wasn't in play, just a prix-fixe menu they set with little to no vegetarian options (not that I'm a vegetarian, but just noting it) and only a few choices.   We decided on the roasted beet and chevre salads and wild mushroom agnolotti (for me) and bison tenderloin (for Seth). 20 minutes after we placed our order, the server came by to advise that the bison was no longer available and offered a beef tenderloin in it's place- no big deal, it's Valentine's Day and we're enjoying an evening away from our kid.   80 MINUTES LATER our first course arrives. No lies. No one came by to explain, no one apologized. It's a small resto and a wait like that, on a prix-fixe menu night, is inexcusable. Other people appeared agitated as well. You can only soak up the kitchy vibe (complete with Bob Dylan soundtrack) for so long, before your hunger gets the best of you and your stomach starts to eat it's own lining.   When the salads arrived, without apology for the delay or even recognition of the delay, we ate them in about 5 minutes. They must have run out of goat cheese, too, because I couldn't find any in my \"roasted beet and chevre\" salad.   Another 35 minutes pass before our entrees arrive. This is literally 2 hours and five minutes after placing our order. I knew there was a problem when I heard two servers, directly behind me (it's a small, small place) arguing about where my agnolotti was. But still, no apology. A server offered a list of desserts to the table next to us to which they responded \"we'll think about dessert, once our main course has arrived....\". When they offered me the dessert list, I almost responded with \"You know, I would LOVE dessert, but I don't have another 90 minutes to wait for it....\" but I didn't.   So, in short, $130 for a small steak, four pieces of pasta and about 2 ounces of goat cheese and half a beet later, we leave, still hungry and annoyed and having wasted a date night on this horrible restaurant experience. And my husband, always the diplomat, still tipped these people. I realize it was likely the fault of the kitchen, but still. There are about 20 tables in there, not 200. Figure it out. Never going back."}
{"text":"Got there at 12 noon on a Saturday.  Had the brisket on a bun with fries.  Really good!  My daughter had a breakfast plate and also said hers was excellent!  Would definitely go back.  Service was a little slow but we were t in a hurry so didn't mind."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, it seems like a neighbourhood place.  We had three dishes, I would only recommend one of them.  Eggplant and lentils looked nice but the eggplant was undercooked.  Roasted cauliflower was also undercooked and did not seem to be roasted.   The Ludi's bowl was tasty -- great garlic in the hummus -- but not enough pita.  It was enough food to share although the eggplant and cauliflower were definitely subpar and expensive given the quality of the preparation.  We won't be going back, but if we lived in the neighbourhood, the atmosphere is good enough that we might try a couple of other dishes to see whether any of them are worth the price."}
{"text":"This place is small but good. We came on a weekday afternoon so there weren't a lot of people. Our waitress was really nice and accommodating because we had a stroller. The house hot sauce was delicious and actually had a hint of sweetness. I got the breakfast burrito and highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I just cant stop loving this place.   Its tiny, tiny, tiny and if you blink you just might miss it from the street view, but oh so good.   My personal fav's are the duck poutine, burgers, fries with shavings of onion and their pate.   If your looking for a place to be well fed, be afforded privacy to just relax and enjoy - this is a go to place.   I like to book a table window in advance, its a tight but cute space for 2.   They also do take-away for when the mood strikes."}
{"text":"Really didn't enjoy the atmosphere or the food. Would never ever go here again. I didn't even touch my dinner, over priced."}
{"text":"I QUITE LIKE IT HERE..  Like I say, not love. But, if we were in Grade 7 \"quite like\" could go a long way...  I've been to RD several times, but mostly for lunches. I love (yes love) the old-timey interior and plush velvet curtains come wintertime, then adore the garden patio in the summer. Interesting wine selections as well- go for the McManis Cabernet; jammy, fruity, yet fine leather on the finish.  I find the service quite good and all the staff very friendly. This is a great spot for a first date- not too fancy, but quaint and fun.  For food- I recommend the Rosedale Burger - served at lunch (and possibly dinner, not sure..) It comes with decadent garlic frites and is served in a fresh pita. Scrumtrilescent..."}
{"text":"Was here for winterlicious 2016. Service was excellent, our server was very attentive and polite, even offering to try to accommodate one of my party, when none of the desserts were to his taste. The diner is very small and I wouldn't recommend going with a group larger than 4, even with 4 our table was a bit cramped. Food was good, but not exceptional, however portion sizes were generous. I had the Sticky Pork Ribs, which some reviewers mentioned, however I found them too sweet (too much hoisin sauce) to my taste. Their hand-cut fries were definitely a plus. Overall, the excellent service made the dinner enjoyable."}
{"text":"They have really nice food, I love the place and the environment. Service was ok, waitress was just doing her job. Clean washrooms."}
{"text":"Fun! funky, cool, and chills..great one word liners, much like this joint Rosedale Diner!! NO surprise this place was on Guy Fieri's \"Triple D\" . This past weekend was my last day, and unfortunate conclusion to Summerlicious 2013, and so this place was a must! alway driving right by this neighborhood gem was a tease! and the patio feels like you're right-at-home!  here's the dig!:  DDD Poutine au Canard off-the-bone duck confit & québécois cheese curds, frites, demi-glace gravy: 5/5 literally fall off the bone! the duck was so tender! it felt like pulled pork/chicken! There was enough gravy to cover this dish and the cheese curds added some yummy gooey fulfillment! who would have thought of duck poutine!?  Steak Frites 5/5 grilled Flat iron with & mini red potatoes and sinfully delicious smoked bacon salad, chimichurri  Beautifully presented! red potatoes hands down is best served with red meat! and the little bacon bites were a cut surprise to the dish! however the chimchurri sauce component really created versatile flavor to the already flavorful steak!....almost like a mint chutney puree sauce..just flava flava!  Flourless chocolate cake 4/5 Though its out of my norm to have cake without flour, i figured id give this a try! lol...it was great, but worth the attempt, and creative.....especially risk factor!  Overall this is definitely among my favs! the old 60's decor, and detor to the patio through their narrow kitchen makes this place seem like home..the people, and ambience has made Rosedale Diner a landmark in the Rosedale neighborhood."}
{"text":"Kitschy, eclectic, hole in the wall'ish . . .  Went here with a group last summer & here's what we had: The Caesar (pretty much as expected) French Onion Soup (to die for & I am a huge Gruyere fan!) Mains: What I REALLY wanted but could not get because finger-lickin' ribs just aren't always appropriate was the Sticky Asian Pork Ribs but (sigh!) instead ordered fish 'n chips which came with a surprisingly large portion of fish and a decent coleslaw. Honestly, after a year, I forgot the fries but if I even made it to the coleslaw they couldn't have been amazing! My husband ordered steak frites which was a well-cooked juicy steak with a garlicky, buttery sauce. Would defiantly come back here as we often visit the fantastic Summerhill LCBO across the street and all those aisles and aisles of booze shopping can really wear a girl out! The only reason I would not give this restaurant a 5 is because it was so sweltering inside, I had to get up and make a fake phone call just to cool off outside - turn on the air or get a fan please!!!! (and maybe the onion soup wasn't the best idea also)"}
{"text":"Excellent service.  Good drink options.   Conscientious menu selection.   Decent execution."}
{"text":"I most recently came here for dinner on a Saturday night. I arrived shortly past 6:30pm and it was not busy. I was able to secure a table by the window, giving me a great view to the street to entertain me and a good glance overlooking the restaurant.  I ordered one of the specials: braised ribs, mashed potatoes and seasonal veggies, and sauce (apologies for not remembering!). The veggies included green beans, brussel sprouts, carrots, some sort of bitter one. They were well done - not over-cooked. The mashed potatoes were homemade, rich and well satisfying. The beef, oh, so tender and exquisite. I devoured my full plate satisfying a well earned hunger from the day.  I drank 2 carafes of water, and a glass of Louis M. Martini's Cabernet Sauvignon. This was rich and full bodied, so it well complemented my beef dish.  The service was delightful, professional and efficient."}
{"text":"A friend and I came upon this almost hidden diner while walking down Yonge street after touring the Mount Pleasant Cemetery. I think it was the word \"diner\" that caught my eye, because I've walked down from Summerhill a couple times during the summer and I never really noticed this diner and its large rose fixture that looms up past the yellow brick walls of the second floor. How did that image never catch my eyes before?? If anyone is going south along yonge and suddenly glimpse the Petit Thuet sign, then look to your right and sweep your eyes upwards haha.  From the outside and when you're inside, this place doesn't look like anything out of the ordinary, the interiors does give it's own distinct character especially around the bar area and also there was still a display of small halloween pumpkins on part of the bar countertop that added more to the relaxing character of the diner. What actually makes this diner slightly different from most of the other diner-style eateries in the city are some of the items on the menu, there were a few items that hinted that the place served some Israeli dishes, especially this one dish called a Shakshuka, a favorite, soothing dish to eat for a brunch meal.  After going over the two page menu which has a lot tasty-sounding fair on it, I just went with the club sandwich and again it had it's own unexpected take to it. The unique take on this sandwich is the brioche type burger bun that the fillings are wedged between, and then cut in half. It felt more filling than a regular sandwich slice. But I wasn't very keen on the straw-cut fries that looked over-fried which is probably how the place likes to serve its fries. They were just two crispy and often I couldn't get a good feel of the potato in my mouth.  Things were going well until it was time to settle the bill and you know what, these days it seems that whenever I dine out with someone else there is often seems to be some sort of mishap over the bill. It now seems less complicated to dine alone. So word to self next time: be the first one to request for separate bills. Like take this specific mishap, which probably could have been resolved quickly, and we were the only two customers inside at this point. So my friend's coffee and my orders were brought together, and the painful part about paying these separately is trying to figure out the tax on it, so I decided to ask for the bill to split and this is when it became a bit complicated and she obviously lost her patience with us. Long story short: she was able split our bills but I could already feel the tension emitted from her. Actually I don't really blame her for almost loosing her cool, hey, complications have also happened whenever payment is involved in any circumstance. So we paid our totals and existed as quickly as we could (period)  I would like to return to the Rosedale Diner to try out the Israeli dishes and a few other Canadianized items. But I better wait for awhile before I come back on my own for a less complicated dining experience :-)"}
{"text":"This restaurant was inaugurated in the same year I was born: 1978 and there's a reason they're still around: This is a great restaurant! I'm not saying it lightly. The food is great, the service is great, the drinks are great and most of all, the atmosphere is great!!"}
{"text":"Just want to start off with how amazing their service was. We had the pleasure of being waited on by Caitlin. She made sure we were enjoying our environment just as much as our food, and she was very thoughtful (especially to the poor mom sitting behind us who had 3 screaming kids with her.. she needed the extra wine)! It's a small place but they accommodated a last minute reservation for 6 of us for Winterlicious! I actually quite enjoyed the cute decor and cozy space.   Now on to what you're reading this whole thing for! THE FOOD!  They definitely offer up some great selections. Very interesting style dishes, a lot that boasted the use of local sources, which I love to see! In summary the dishes were extremely generous portions & strong flavours (which worked for some and not so much for others.. ie. too salty sometimes). If you want to know about specific dishes, keep on reading! We tried the following dishes & I'll tell you what we thought! It's a lot so.. best take a seat to read this ;)  Apps: Duck Poutine: It wasn't on the winterlicious menu, but because it had been posted as such online, Caitlin happily honoured it for us. :) It was quite delicious! I love their fries here and the cheese curds were generous. The duck tasted great & I've never had a duck poutine before so this was something new. I would say it's a touch salty, but yummy nonetheless.   Duck Liver Pate: again, generous portion. served with pickled onion and raisins of some sort. stack them on a crostini and you got something delicious!  Calamari with Hot sauce & aioli: nice dressing and not too thick breading. very refreshing!  Brie dip: I can't recall the name... but this was baked brie with some type of chutney and pita. It was quite nice! I love Brie!  Mains: Short ribs: comes with a bomb coleslaw! If I could.. I would eat that coleslaw forever.. Fries are amazing! The short ribs were tender but I would say, it's way too sweet (Hence the coleslaw i suppose)!!  It came a bit cold so we had to send it in to be heated up. The kitchen very kindly made fresh fries and coleslaw when they brought the ribs back out. So very thoughtful!   Steak & Frites: AMAZING! Comes with Blue Cheese Mash.. have you ever had blue cheese in your mashed potatoes? GO TRY IT! :) I love the ingredients they combine here! And steak was perfectly cooked!  Wagyu Burger: There's brie, truffle oil, and some dressing and other toppings. It tasted great but it was so much flavour in each bite that it is a bit over whelming. Again, loved the fries. I seriously would come here and order a giant plate of fries.. haha!   Seafood stew: This was a bit underwhelming for my family who ordered it. I thought it was a bit salty, but you definitely have a rich seafood flavour in the broth. There's a generous amount of seafood in there and it comes with a bread to dip!  Dessert: Rosewater Panna cotta: Was very excited for panna cotta. It was made very well, but the rosewater is very over powering. Reminded me of a rose scented lotion/ perfume. Maybe the only thing I didn't quite enjoy 100%.  Salted Caramel Pudding: This tasted quite nice! I kept getting the mouthful of salt so maybe you gotta mix it a bit before you dig in hahaa but it was a nice dessert to end off the night.   Overall, I'd come back again and try different things on their menu. The staff are amazing, and you can tell the chef put a lot of heart into his own style of food.  I'm excited to see what else they will come up with!"}
{"text":"Really good burger and cool little patio. Perfect for a warm summer night. Also an excellent beer selection."}
{"text":"Just inhaled one of the best Lox & Cream chee plates in town on the patio here Its a hidden Toronto gem & they have a nice cider selection too!"}
{"text":"The all meats meal is one of the best breakfasts in the city. That spicy patty is amazing."}
{"text":"I first heard of this place when I saw it on tv on the show \"diners, drive-ins, and dives\". I begged my boyfriend to take me and so we went. Oh boy, it was really amazing. A waitress walked by with other people's food and the minute we smelled it we went crazy. I order the duck poutine, and my partner had the club sandwich and it was amazing!! The flavours are so rich and have such depth it was a true culinary adventure. I was worried that I wouldn't like the duck because it would taste funny or game-y but it was the opposite! It was actually really good and had a beautiful flavour. This place is an absolute must for foodies and I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Quite honestly disappointing. This is a diner that makes every list... literally every list. If you're a tourist, guaranteed the concierge will send you here. I ended up here because it was my friend's choice. It was her birthday and we wanted to do brunch - she thought this would be a good choice. Before ordering we wanted to leave about 4 times.   Service, after switching waitresses, was quite pleasant. The first server we had was not in a good mood at noon.   Food is mediocre, nothing to write home about. I wouldn't call it a classic diner either. I really missed classic breakfast/brunch staples. Even the coffee was missing something. Perhaps because it's served in a glass tea cup. Uninviting. Usually you go to a diner, get a good mug and ask for refills.   My friend had eggs benedict - it's not something I eat but even I know the egg yolk is supposed to be runny. They make it 'medium' as we were told. Medium means, it doesn't run.   After everything, a shock to cap it off - as someone who dines out about 3-4 times a week and have celebrated birthdays at restaurants - was that they actually charged for the desert I asked to be brought out for my friend's birthday. I've never ever seen that before.   I see that another patron has also mentioned about a birthday. It is such a strange occurrence that a restaurant can't afford a piece of cake with a candle in it....."}
{"text":"Server was a little rude.  Ordered the calamari, duck confit poutine and the trout fish with miso soba - all very tasty. Definitely not your typical diner."}
{"text":"Quaint is the perfect word to describe this place. I mean, just look it: the neon sign above the door that spells out the diner's name in a retro cursive font, the potted plants outside the windows, and the tables by the door that barely fit 2 adults.   The exterior definitely reminds one of simpler times. The interior? A comfortable setup for a weekend brunch (unless you are sitting by the door, which might be a tad tight, but these seats are amazing for people watching).  The quality and the presentation of food is definitely above average, and there is something for everyone - whether you prefer traditional breakfast foods or call yourself a foodie. The portions are just right and so is the level of greasiness.   I have been here twice and will definitely come back again next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Had a great meal here... Started off with sharing some calamari... Very tender with great aioli... Then our table shared the sticky Asian ribs (delicious) and duck poutine (thinly sliced duck over perfectly cooked fries, melted québécois cheese curds, and duck gravy... Almost too much... Almost!!). Paired with a great craft beer... What more can you ask for? The only issue was tables were a bit close which made the restaurant loud once the crowd arrived... Difficult for conversation. I would recommend this upscale diner... Triple-D's is right again!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot! I've been twice now, first time brunch on the back patio and last weekend dinner indoors. This is not your standard diner - lots of interesting menu options/flavours and good service. Also nice to have a more affordable option is a somewhat pricey neighbourhood. I'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful meal tonight at Rosedale Diner. Wonderful, fresh foods. Everything is homemade and delicious. My husband had fish and chips and the portion was not only enormous it was all too good. He never eats his French fries but couldn't resist them here. They cut onions in with them!   I had the fish special. Delicious and cooked just right. The management went out of this way to accommodate my Celiac with gluten free substitutions to my meal...including gluten free bread points for their devious Hummas and Brie appetizers.    Such a delightful and quiet setting eating back in the patio. A wonderful experience. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Solid food. The best Asian sticky ribs and hummus in town. The organic steak, duck confit and duck poutine are all worth the trip. Consistent. Comforting. Nice patio, although the trip through the kitchen to get there is a bit weird."}
{"text":"Lets be honest - it's great diner food if you think it's really diner food.  the menu is good, certain things are amazing , and certain things could be better. Their duck confit is a little too sweet and flaky. The duck poutine is conceptually good, but please, it needs to be an appetizer for the amount of salt in the dish. Then again, their ossobuco is rich and amazing and then also served on gnocci - touch my inappropriately please.   I would go here for sure."}
{"text":"Last visit. Period. I've been coming here for years but the last few months it just hasn't been good. Last straw was standing at the doorway for about 10 minutes with no acknowledgement from the staff. Lots of empty tables. Greeter was busy with more important tasks then customers. We left and won't be back. Contempt for customers is a good sign to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Small and quaint, this little diner has charm. Coffee is good. I got the shakshuka, which was very good. Service was just ok- the place was not full, so I can't imagine how it would be when it's busy. I would recommend this diner."}
{"text":"This is definitely an excellent choice for weekend brunch--a touch above your typical diner.  I had the Eggs Dostoevsky (poached eggs & hollandaise on an english muffin w/ smoked salmon & frites for $13).  Wonderful!  P.S.  I love the back patio in the summer!"}
{"text":"Eat there the other night. Had the hummus to start. Best hummus in Toronto served with some delicious warm pita. For our mains we shared the daily meat and vege platter. Came with tons of chicken and ribs, more than we could finish. The ribs we spectacular: sticky and BBQ flavour. The chicken was moist and in the most amazing sauce. Fries and veges also very tasty. Service was slow, but without asking or mentioning anything, they offered us free dessert to make up for it. Really nice gesture, so we consumed chocolate cake and ice cream for dessert. Too much food by the end of it, but a fantastic meal. Other than the slow service, servers were attentive and pleasant. Decor very warm and welcoming. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I first visited this place as a result of a groupon.  I love the atmosphere of the restaurant as every table varies and it's somewhat of a hodge podge.  The decorative is cute, eclectic, vintage and kitzsy.  Exactly my kind of place.  The food is diverse and focuses on local (best way to support your city).  I recommend the brie dip app.  Soo good.  Prices are a little high, but the food is delicious!  Cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Fairly pricey for brunch with very cramped seating.  The food was just ok in my opinion.  I also didn't like how the waitor kept pushing us to order additional drinks and desserts and had a very condescending tone because we were comfortable with just ordering entrees."}
{"text":"It was generally good- it's a cosy environment that's good for bringing parents and/or old people. The food was decent and the server was nice, maybe a little overwhelmed. It's too expensive for what it is- but I suppose the rent is high in Rosedale. The tables are too close to each other, so we had to be careful about what we said in front of all of the old people beside us."}
{"text":"Good food, lovely patio but mix service, took a long time to get the bill and the waiter was snarky."}
{"text":"This is a little gem of the beaten path. We say on the patio and to cut through the kitchen to get there. It is a reinvented diner for the modern age with a great duck poutine, duck pate, Israeli breakfast, and many other items. Worth the trip and I think it was featured on triple D."}
{"text":"Great lunch. Fries with onions.... Yum! That said, the homemade hot sauce is killer! Great flavour but not too hot. Wonderful addition to an omelette. Check it out."}
{"text":"Went tonight. Went with a friend. We shared entrees. We got the vegan Moroccan tangine and the Asian ribs.    The ribs were great. Small ribs separated, not on the rack.  The fried were tasty and the Cole slaw yum.  The tangine had good flavour.  It was just on this side of cooked. Could have done with more cooking. Got the creme brulé and tartufo for dessert. Was good. Would have given 4 but for under cooked tangine, tiny ribs, and pricy dessert. Would go back but not first choice."}
