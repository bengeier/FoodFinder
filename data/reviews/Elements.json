{"text":"Unbelievable. No words to describe the magnitude of this place. Food's divine. View's divine. So romantic. Expensive, yes, but sooo worth it. Try the Chilean Sea Bass if you ever get the chance. OMG. Almost brought me to tears."}
{"text":"We first dined at Elements about a year ago. Denise was our server. She was one of the best servers we have ever had at any restaurant! She is amazing. We had the pork chop and filet - both 5/5 stars. Both were delicious and perfectly prepared.   We dined with Elements again tonight to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. Everything was amazing as usual. We were fortunate to have Denise again, who is one of the best servers we have ever had (and we had dined at many placed in the world). She was prompt, friendly, accommodating, and one of the best servers we have ever experienced! The foie gras was out of this world, and the bison carpaccio was light, tasty, and flavorful. The opah was fresh and delicate, and the lobster udon was incredible. Beau is a fantastic chef - we are more impressed by his food than many of our other restaurants that we frequent. Beau and Denise are the best!"}
{"text":"Brunch on Sunday after New Years was perfection!  First, the setting is magnificent with splendid table settings, modern design and superb views.  We were warmly welcomed and given a view table.  Excellent Spanish sparkling wine promptly served while awaiting friends.  Fresh squeezed OJ brought in beaker to make our own mimosas.  Bloody Mary's can be ordered at a hefty charge, but not needed when bubbly is included.  Buffet is modest compared to some, but here quality wins out with nicely displayed salads, fruits, cheeses, cold meats, fantastic smoked salmon, cold shrimp, crab and bagels, breads, etc.  Huge omelets are included and made to order.  Do not miss the buffet of small desserts--all outstanding in appearance and taste.  The pecan pie miniature was my favorite.  Superb service with silver and plates changed as required without asking.  Will not wait for New Years to return."}
{"text":"Wonderland zen atmosphere with breathtaking views. The food was second-to-none; Asian fusion perfectly applied. My wife and I started with the Oysters Rockefeller and calamari followed by the lobster and short ribs with a side of brussel sprouts. If we had it all to do over we'd order the exact same thing again. Outstanding!"}
{"text":"Beautiful setting, delicious food, and friendly service make this a wonderful place to dine.  Had dinner here with the bf for a nice night out.  We had reservations for 6:00 p.m.:  just in time to catch the start of the sunset.  The view was amazing.  The only downside was that the sun was in my eyes for about 10-15 minutes because the shade on one of the windows wasn't working.  The waitress was very nice about it, but I would recommend reserving one of the more secluded window booths if possible.  We ordered the oysters to start -- both oven baked and raw.  The oven baked oysters were a slight variation on oysters Rockefeller, and were great.  The raw ones were flavorful but not overwhelming.  Bf got the soup of the day, which was a tomato cream-based soup with shrimp and heirloom tomatoes.  I tried some and it was fantastic.  As for the entrees:  I ordered the seared sea scallops and the bf had the NY strip steak.  The scallops were perfection.  The pasta and roasted peppers that accompanied the scallops were a nice complement to their slightly nutty flavor.  The steak was tender and well-prepared.  The caramelized onions and vegetable side that came with the steak weren't great, but that was the only downside to the meal.  We had the \"red\" dessert.  Overall, we both loved it, although the raspberries in sweet pesto sauce were somewhat questionable.  The tab was high, but we both left well-satisfied (but not disgustingly stuffed) and thinking about our next splurge at Elements."}
{"text":"Three women met for lunch last Friday at Elements at the Sanctuary.  It was a birthday lunch for my sister.  We did have a baby with us (he was very good, sat in the high chair provided, etc.).  The service was HORRIBLE.  We waited over 30 minutes to have our order taken.  (after we waved down the hostess).  Our food did not arrive for an hour and half!  They couldn't serve our salads, because the table had never been bussed from our appetizer.  The table was left full of dishes the entire time.  The mother and baby left without finishing her lunch because the baby was tired and it took FOREVER.  My sister and I asked for another roll and was told, \"no, we sold them all already.\"  We then decided to stay and have a glass of wine.  The waiter never came back, never offered coffee, dessert or anything.  We left and will not be back.  On the way out, the waiter says, \"oh, happy birthday.\"  Geez!  what about a token bday dessert or something!  Wake up Sanctuary!  Scottsdale has too many other restaurants that want our money."}
{"text":"Many thanks to the staff and management for setting an amazing table in their private room.  We kept changing the numbers and they were great.  View into the kitchen is very nice or you can close the curtain and have complete privacy.  The food was excellent.  I would go back in a moments notice.    You also must meet Angela the bartender.  She is so nice, friendly, and a real pleasure."}
{"text":"We recently went to Elements with a group for my husband's birthday.  From start to finish, the service and experience were excellent.  I have seen mixed reviews and was hesitant to book as it was a (40th) birthday.  But, it exceeded my expectations.  Valet was easy, ambience was very cool but not pretentious ,service at the bar, friendly.  They accommodated our request for a table for the occasion, waitstaff were efficient, and the food was excellent.  Half of our table had the sea bass special and it was delicious.  It is pricey, but keeping that in mind I would highly recommend the restaurant.  I'd also go back for drinks at the bar."}
{"text":"I have to give props to Chef Beau McMillan for doing \"fusion\"  right. \"Fusion\" is a dime a dozen nowadays, and only a few can do it well. For dinner, I highly suggest the salmon with the udon noodles, if it is available (menu changes depending on what's in season). And for dessert, please try the banana concoction. It is just divine! So, yes, I'm a big fan of Chef Beau (he is not pretentious and seems fun). Afterall, he did beat Bobby Flay on Iron Chef."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for lunch on a Friday afternoon. The first thing I noticed was the view! It's fantastic!! We had a lovely booth so we can admire the scenery while we ate. The server, Olga, was very friendly and efficient. We had the pot stickers and the peppers to start and they were good. I had the Kobe hotdog and my husband had the burger and they were good. I was hoping for amazing but we got good. I would go back with out of town guests to show off the view. The ceiling had cobwebs hanging down too."}
{"text":"We always had cocktails by the pool at the Sanctuary but never tried out the restaurant Elements. The view from the restaurant is so vast and beautiful. The Ahi tuna salad that was very well prepared. The Bento box was very tasty as well. Did not expect so many Japanese dishes here. Best spot for tourists and locals. Still looking for an opportunity to return."}
{"text":"--Only vouching for the breakfast!--  I like to take friends in town here for brunch because most of my friends visit from Chicago and its nice to take them to the mountain and sit and enjoy the view. Its a peaceful way to have breakfast and its not too bad of a price. Two of my favorite entrees are the bagel and lox and the oh so dreamy banana chocolate beglein waffles. My friend and I liked the waffles so much that we tried to recreate them the next day. It didn't work as well as we thought it would.   If there are only two of you going, definately call ahead and see if you can get a booth facing the window. Its breathtaking!"}
{"text":"A great fine dining place! 4.5/5 J and I were there this Saturday with AJ and J. That was my first time to the Elements and I was totally in love with the restaurant's location and surrounding. What a view!  We were seated on a cute bench overlooking at the mountain and sunset that evening. The service was excellent from the moment you stepped inside the restaurant. We started our meal with steam mussels in a delicious creamy sauce. The sauce was a little salty but it was perfect to dip your bread in! (bread was fresh, crusty and warm!). Among 4 of us, we had salmon with asian twist, pork chop, halibut and honey orange duck breast. I have to say among all of them (except pork chop, didn't try that one), the duck breast was my fav! Probabaly the best duck breast (in western style) I'd tried before! Will definitely get that one again next time.  One thing to mention is they have very creative coctails list. J got a suger snap peas martini and it was amazing~ you can taste the subtle fresh sweetness of the snap peas. I had a rasberry martini and I enjoyed it as well.  The experience was memorable and amazing. You can watch the sunset while having a superb dinner and great conversation. I would go back again for its brunch!"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely amazing! the view overlooking Scottsdale is hard to beat, the service is incredible, and the food is beyond! We had the Chilean Sea Bass special and Bison appetizer, and the soup was the best I've ever had. My boyfriend took me here for our anniversary and Anthony our waiter made us feel so very special! I cannot recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"NOTHING beats the view. Sit on the patio with your honey and sip a cantelope martini and watch the sun set over PV. Ah-mazing. Also, this is the only place where I have asked for extra blue cheese stuffed olives with my dirty martini and they gave me a bowl of them. A BOWL! I've come here for lunches too, but I prefer the adjoiing Jade Bar for a pre- or post-dinner drink."}
{"text":"We were so looking forward to our first visit but were so disappointed.    Our table was booked for 7:30, we arrived 20 mins early, our table wasn't ready, which was expected so we went into the bar for cocktails.    First issue, we waited at least 10 minutes to be attended, then almost 15 minutes for our drinks to arrive.  At 7:45 we ordered a second drink, at 7:50 it arrived and I asked the waitress to check on when our table was going to be ready, this obviously worked as within 3 minutes we were informed the table was ready. We were escorted to a booth overlooking the valley, but unfortunately the sun had gone down so no sighting of the sunset that we were told was so spectacular.  Second, and most importantly, the food.  I ordered the double cut pork chop that was rubbed asian style (hoisin sauce and 5 spice), medium, unfortunately the spice was so overwhelming and the pork chop dry I couldn't eat it.  I am a foodie that knows and loves asian flavors well, but this was too much.  They offered me another dish, I accepted, the filet mignon, which was good but not exceptional.  We ordered a side dish, Brussels sprouts with pork belly, perhaps I missed the rest of the description on the menu but they were in a spicy asian sauce, not a good accompaniment for the filet mignon that my wife ordered.  Third, the attention we received was a little disappointing.  The waitress was very knowledgeable, but slightly inattentive and our wait between courses was  a minimum 10 minutes.  The worst was when we finished our entree and waited to be offered desert, 15 minutes before she turned up, but when she did it was free desert, a bonus, apricot with shortcake, I have to say it was not memorable.  Unfortunately there was no offer of any other options or after dinner drinks.    Overall, I will return as I think the atmosphere in the bar was good, I hope the experience was a one off and the next time will be memorable.  The setting is spectacular and needs to be backed by spectacular service and food."}
{"text":"I was in Scottsdale on business last week. My fiance and I were excited to go to elements after learning it was Beau MacMillan's restaurant. We didn't go in with high expectations, just wanted to have a great meal and experience.  Boy, did it not disappoint.  Our servers were phenomenal. I had read some of the Yelp reviews prior to making our reservation and wanted to see if they were right. We didn't notice any lack of attentiveness on their end.  As an aside - if you go for dinner, definitely get a reservation around sunset. It has absolutely stunning views that shouldn't be missed.  We started off with the ahi tuna tartare. Simple and executed perfectly.  My fiance got the braised short ribs which was amazing. The short ribs were incredibly tender and flavorful. About the only downside was the placement of the truffle mac and cheese (underneath the short ribs instead of off to the side). I had the duck with forbidden rice. As a duck hunter, I've had my fair share of ducks. This duck was cooked perfectly, and the cherry braised cabbage and forbidden rice completed the dish nicely.  We picked the PB bomb for dessert. Don't bother looking at the menu, just get the PB bomb.  Overall, there's not much more I would have improved. I'm looking forward to returning to Scottsdale and stopping by elements again."}
{"text":"Elements is one of my favorite restaurants in the valley. The combination of setting and amazing food is hard to beat.  The view from the restaurant is worth a trip alone, especially when the sun is setting.  The food is unforgettable as well, the calamari is straight fuego.  If you get a chance to go here, don't miss it."}
{"text":"The restaurant was empty at 2:30pm. Great restaurant except when it is a holiday and they charge $80.00 for a brunch.  I eat here a number of times a year but must stay Easter is a rip off, Lobster Bisque, Fried Chicken with waffles and Desert.  I will still eat here in the future but never on a holiday or a prix fix Jim Kearns"}
{"text":"The food is above average, but it is not especially innovative or creative.  They use quality ingredients in standard combinations for a tasty product.  The tuna tartare was a standout, I had a venison special that was merely good. The waiter couldn't answer a few questions about the food and went to check for me.  I generally expect a little more familiarity with the food at \"upscale\" places.   You are definitely being upcharged for the view and the setting - but for a special dinner, it is worth it, because the view and setting are pretty killer. Stop by the Jade bar before or after dinner - it is my fave place in AZ for drinks."}
{"text":"I think I set my expectations too high, plus it was my birthday dinner so had the restaurant choice resting on my shoulders... I'm giving it 3 stars for the shear reason that the macaroni and cheese was such a spectacular gem in the meal experience. The service was atrocious, they forgot that it was a birthday dinner and we sat next to loud family with 3-4 texting teens (oh yes, there ARE a few signs around that say no cell phone use but apparently they don't apply to this table).   The spicy calamari and tuna carpaccio on watermelon  were delish to start. Thank goodness as they seemed to be out of everything from the bar and never came back in time for me to order a glass of wine.  Looking dapper in linen pants, my date had the filet which was amazing. My scallops and sweet pea risotto were ok...have had better scallops but it was a good dish.  Desert was merely \"eh\" so don't save room - lick the mac-n-cheese bowl and don't expect a second cup of coffee unless you have a flare gun or send out an expedition party.  Would try again just in the hopes of getting a better table not in the back and  experiencing better end to end meal."}
{"text":"Food, service and a view of the valley during sunset.  I was a happy camper on my birthday.  The salad with the mustard dressing was too strong, I couldn't finish it because it was so potent.  However, my bacon wrapped filet with horseradish mashed potatoes was amazing.  They brought out a chocolate cake with melted chocolate in the center - delicious."}
{"text":"There are a lot of great places to enjoy 'finer' dining in Scottsdale/Phoenix, but Elements has by far the best backdrop in the Valley.  Beautiful place to eat in a great setting.  The meal will be pricey, but I feel the food and ambiance are well worth it.  Great, but expensive, bar area with comfortable seating and again, great views of the Valley."}
{"text":"Best fine dining in Scottsdale area. We were seated outside the last time we went and had a fabulous view. It couldn't have been better.  The cocktail list is amazing - lots of unique drinks -- all great -- must try when you go.   We've mostly ordered the specials and have loved everything we've eaten. The seafood is amazing. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Elements is truly one of the Valley's fine dining gems, thanks to the amazing food from Chef Beau MacMillan and the spectacular setting. They recently underwent a multi-million renovation - I never saw the dining room before, but now it's sleek and modern. It almost feels a bit Japanese minimalist, but this wisely puts the focus on the food and the gorgeous views. If you try Elements for dinner, make sure you get there before the sun goes down to take in the sunset and mountain views and then the lights of nighttime. Service is friendly and helpful, although not quite as refined and attentive as you might expect in a restaurant of this caliber.  To start, they brought us rolls with hummus dip that were so good, I was afraid I'd fill up on that alone. For an appetizer, two of us shared the short rib ravioli, which was to die for! It's only one ravioli, but it's quite large. The combination of flavors is amazing, and the short rib inside is so tender. For entrees, we had the scallops and the flat iron steak - both dishes were exceptional! The three jumbo scallops were perfectly seared, tender and sweet, and came served over a lobster pea risotto and with a mustard sauce. The flat iron was also perfectly cooked, super tender for what can be a rougher cut of meat, and with a nice, mildly sweet hoisin sauce. We finished by sharing the pineapple upside down cake, with coconut gelato. The desserts are small portions, and we probably could have used a second, but then we might not have been able to enjoy the delectable chocolate chip cookies they brought out with the the bill. I always find that a nice touch and it's something that costs a restaurant very little but leaves a wonderful, lasting final impression.  Elements may not be THE best restaurant in town, but as long as Chef MacMillan keeps devoting his time and energy here (with the help of his staff), in addition to his many \"celebrity chef\" duties, it will remain ONE OF the best. And those views don't hurt, either."}
{"text":"Great views and great food! I got a delicious, complementary cupcake to-go and even the valet wished me a happy birthday! An excellent spot for a date night or special occasion!"}
{"text":"I've only been to Elements for drink and have always wanted to experience the menu. So last Friday, I did just that and what an experience it was.  The service was great but not annoying like what I experienced at Lon's. I loved the Buddha bread and eggplant dip. It was a nice way to start our dinner. My friend and I tried the cheddar cheese grits & scampi - WOW! Let me just say I've never had grits before. These grits melted in my mouth like sugar. Now ,I understand what people mean when they say good grits are not just grits they are heaven.  I had the filet migon on puff pasty with caramelized onions and sauteed mushrooms - delicious. I was really impressed with the cut and preparation of my filet - it was flawless! And of course we couldn't eat at Elements without paying homage to the pastry chief too. We ordered a dessert which was a trio of chocolate. There was a milk chocolate pate like dessert that tasted like a creamy fudgicle on steroids, homemade marshmallow and a melt in your mouth dark chocolate torte.   Great food, great service and a breathe taking view...you just can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Incredible view! Breathtaking view of Camelback mountain and praying Monk. Perfect place for morning breakfast date. Delicious food! Try cucumber basil lemonade. It is a true sanctuary."}
{"text":"This is a spot when you want to splurge on gourmet food, or you're celebrating. I've been here 3 or 4 times. I had my 30th bday on the Edge lounge with a group of about 20 friends, and just had drinks and appetizers. Another time on Valentines day with my husband, and then recently about 2 months ago for my friends engagement celebration. Absolutely the best spot with a great view in the Phoenix area! I bring visitors here in the daytime for coffee to enjoy the view. As far as the food, I had the grilled tofu special with a sauce that had wasabi, it was sooo good. A blend of soft, crunchy, sweet and spicy all blended to perfection. A side of truffle oil mac n cheese was a great pairing. All the desserts looked yummy, I think we tried the cheesecake. The only reason I gave it 5 stars was because of the ambiance the decor, and for the food with an amazing view! The only downer was the poor service we got the last time I was there, the server was slow and not that intuitive. You would expect over the top service for a pricey restaurant like this."}
{"text":"Eating at the Sanctuary came highly recommended by a local so my friend and I had to make it a part of our trip.  The restaurant is located almost at the top of Camelback Mountain and it was so pleasurable to wend our way through all the beautiful homes and resorts.  When we walked in, right away I was struck by the spectacular view.  Thankfully we were just in time to order from the brunch menu.  I had the French toast and it was delicious and very filling.  I also ordered a side of potatoes which was a little flavorless but nothing a sprinkling of salt and pepper couldn't fix. To our delight the waitress told us all the juices are freshly squeezed so I had the grapefruit juice.  It was a bit too sweet for my taste but I appreciated the freshness.  The staff was very pleasant and everyone we met greeted us politely.  We relaxed and really enjoyed our time here!"}
{"text":"Don't bother. If you want the view, just get drinks at Jade Bar and sit outside.  The service is good here, but the food is mediocre and overpriced. The drinks are expensive, too, but at least they're good!  Don't hate on me for not respecting the view, but why bother eating bad food when you can have drinks with the same view?"}
{"text":"Actually, the wife and I celebrated our 15 year anniversary here October 1st.  Place is definitely swanky!  Suited up and classed out!  Loved every bit of the ambiance, the plating, the flavor, and the scenery.  Perfect place for a special occasion."}
{"text":"My wife and I went for a 32nd wedding anniversary. It was awesome. Our waiter, Sean , was great, the drinks were wonderful, and the food was spectacular. For example, my short ribs cut easily with just a fork and melted in my mouth. The only short coming is that the corner seat that we were in was a little warm."}
{"text":"Amazing...Music, Drinks , Food ....quit Intoxicating .... :)) Beautiful start to a Wonderful New Year..!!!! Blessing 2 us all ..xxo"}
{"text":"Great place for special occasions.  We had dinner here and the food was excellent.  The view and the atmosphere are very Paradise Valley."}
{"text":"Really overpriced.   Without the view, this restaurant would not make it.  I don't mind paying for an expensive meal, but it was barely above average.  My wife ordered salmon cooked well and it was raw in the middle.   My rib eye was over $50 and it was very average with a lot of extra fat.   Table of 8 and too noisy to talk across to the other side of the  table.   Go for one very expensive drink at sunset and then find another restaurant for dinner."}
{"text":"Located at Sanctuary Camelback Mountain Resort & Spa, this is a beautiful place. There are some great views and a nice patio and large windows to enjoy them. I went here with my family for Thanksgiving, the meal was excellent. I had a Kobe beef carpaccio appetizer/salad with truffles, it was very good. The dinner I choose was the traditional Thanksgiving dinner, turkey, gravy, stuffing, mashed potatoes. And for dessert I choose the pumpkin cheesecake. Everything was very good. We had some cocktails at the bar before and after dinner, the bar was cool with a wide range of people of every age. Very cool."}
{"text":"Beautiful space. This place feels like you're on vacation or on a \"break\" from the real world. I had the fish which was delicate and flavorful. The Jade Bar is a little small, but classy. I would take all of my out-of-towners here."}
{"text":"Me and wife came for our 8th anniversary. The food was superb. I had the duck. We had a booth looking out towards mummy mountain. Jade bar bar staff was great. Overall A+ experience!!"}
{"text":"We recently tried this place out for Mother's Day after having this on my \"wish list\" for sometime now and were thrilled by the breath taking views and the delicious food. However, we found the pricing high for the breakfast brunch ($60 per person) and felt that we've had better value at Camelback Inn's Sunday Brunch where the buffet choices were much more expansive. There was an open buffet for the appetizers and desserts, but only one choice entree for the main course. We did walk away very full though. I'd definitely like to return again to try a regular meal, but hopefully a bit smaller check."}
{"text":"4 stars is about right. Some dishes work, others not that exceptional. Wine list becomes more expensive each year....  Advice: order 3 appetizers.  Have had much better luck with them.  Entrees are barely larger, get two apps for the price of one entree and maximize your palate.   Space is beautiful, of course."}
{"text":"Did not eat at the restaurant but had drinks at Jade bar. Perfect location and great views of Paradise Valley. Very upscale and classy instiution. Prices are on the high side but its worth it."}
{"text":"Great views. This place will be 5 stars as soon as the kitchen renovation is completed and the chef's table is up and running. Make reservations NOW. Beau MacMillan is a Iron chef champ, and he cooks American cusines with an Asian flaire. The wine list is possibly the best in town, with hard to find bottles and great wines by the glass."}
{"text":"Amazing Asian flare to most entries and many diverse choices of proteins.  The opah is u describable with so many flavors weaving in and out of each bite. The staff goes beyond in making sure everything is as desired.  I would recommend this restaurant for any special event or just for anyone that loves food"}
{"text":"Disappointing. The extra star is for the view. We had the chicken and the filet mignon. While our sidedishes of vegetables and macaroni and cheese were decent, the meat was  not. I cannot believe that, at this price, the meat does not have good flavor!! It was very sad and disappointing.   Also, I had a melon martini and it was horrible! It tasted like they used a rotten cantaloupe (used as liquid in drink and as a piece of fruit to garnish)."}
{"text":"Went to Elements for our annual Christmas dinner on Saturday 12/21. This was our first time at Elements . I requested a booth when making reservations. The food was amazing and our booth was very relaxing. My wife had the Seabass ...great flavor slightly crusted awesome! I had the NY Prime prepared medium . An excellent cut of meat well prepared and melts in your mouth. We each ordered Martina's which came out in a not so impressed glass but in all very good  Two thumbs up!! Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"If you live in Phoenix and haven't been to Elements, then you are missing out.  One of the best restaurants in Phoenix - great food, great service, great views.  My wife and I have made this our anniversary dinner for the last three years and have yet to be disappointed.  That said, it's expensive, but worth the money.  I will always pay good money for good food, but can't stand paying good money for junk.  As long as Chef Beau is doing his thing here, this is a must.  Did I mention the views?  North side of Camelback, great at sunset, 'nuff said."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is so beautiful for a Sunday brunch.  I began with a Bellini which was perfect.   We were seated in a booth that overlooked the mountains, and as usual it was a beautiful day.  I had the blueberry waffles which were sooooo tasty.  The waffle had a lemon marscapone on top which sounds odd, but tasted great.  They also give you a cinnamon bun with your meal which melts in your mouth (although a bit filling).  The only reason it did not receive five stars, was it took 15 minutes to get our coffee when we first sat down....way too long!  Update!!! Went back recently and the service was MUCH better.  The food of course, was still excellent. 4.5 stars now"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to dinner tonight, we were very disappointed! not one good thing to say about the whole experience. We will never go back. This chef should have not quite his day job to become a mediocre TV star, as our last meal was great. Very Sad Tammy"}
{"text":"MY 100TH REVIEW-WOOHOO!   I was a lil excited there haha, but I saved this particular review for my 100th because my husband & I went here to celebrate our 1st wedding anniversary! So it's pretty special, to me. Any way...   We arrived on Sunday, December 12th, at 8pm. We were seated in a booth overlooking Camelback mountain, it was gorgeous! I loved the whole look & feel of the restaurant, just an overall great ambiance & atmosphere.   We started out with the braised mussels & chorizo in spiced moroccan lobster broth, an amazing app! We then decided to order a couple cocktails, hubs ordered the jaded pear & I ordered the strawberry lavender royale. Very pretty drinks but we didn't care for either. For our entrees; my husband ordered the slow braised beef short ribs that came with anson mills aged cheddar grits, asparagus & mushroom ragu & I ordered the pan roasted free range chicken that came with roasted garlic mash, creamed spinach & sweet onion pancetta jus. Both meals were absolutely phenomenal! We were much too full for dessert so we passed, but a few minutes later our sweet server brought us a yummy chocolate/peanut butter dessert & wished us a happy anniversary. I wish I knew the name of it, but I can assure you, it was decadent & divine.   Total with tip was about $145. Pricey, but completely worth it in my opinion. I would love to return for our 2nd anniversary!"}
{"text":"Elements restaurant is ALWAYS AMAZING! With Iron Chef / Celebrity Chef Beau MacMillan at the helm and his wonderful staff the service, cuisine and experience is second to none! 5+ Stars!!! Of course we'll be back again and again!  Don't miss it I'd you're in the area! The views at sunset are to die for too!"}
{"text":"The best view in town so far for me. The staff were great. The food was not so. We had the clam and mussels and the clam chowder soup as starter. For main dishes the duck and the salmon. All the food wasn't that good except for the salmon which was above average but not great. The duck was raw and the clam chowder was just like cans food. I am giving it a high grade just for the view and staff."}
{"text":"My wife and I experienced a five-star performance on Valentine's Day. The food, service, ambiance and vistas were unbeatable."}
{"text":"First time at Elements and it did not disappoint. 5 stars plus to Denise our waitress. I had the pork chop with brussels sprouts which was flawlessly prepared with incredible flavor.  Same for the wife who chose the ribeye. The beautiful views only made the experience that much better.   The only downside, the lounge band playing at the adjacent Jade Bar was very loud and - while talented - the volume was just too much for us. Maybe I'm just getting old..."}
{"text":"We were sat at a perfect table overlooking Camelback Mountain. It was a stunning view as we ate 4 courses of appetizers. We had everything from ahi tar tar, kimchi bacon to the mussels. Fine dining with a foodie flare. Loved our experience and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't already been said?  Is it expensive?  Yes, but you already knew that.  Is it worth it?  Absolutely!  The service is superb, the food is delicious, and the views are jaw dropping.  The location of the restaurant provides spectacular views that are unique only to this property.  Highly recommended!!!!"}
{"text":"I was very dissapointed with the flavors of the meals and the $$$$. I think the only positive is the buddha bread and eggplant dip.   It is very hard to get a reservation between 6:30-7:30 pm , as most people want to enjoy the sunset view.  Overall - an expensive place with great ambience minus great flavor!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a sunset dinner overlooking the valley last Sunday evening.  The views and surroundings were spectacular.  Our server was charming and low key.  Unfortunately, the food did not impress.     We began the meal with cocktails; the bar was out of their delicious yuzu/beet juice libation.  We made due with watery martinis.  -- We ordered the soft shell crab appetizer, also unavailable.  --The oysters appetizer was heavily laden with a cream sauce, robbing the diner of any semblance of an oyster beneath. --The escargot and mushroom wonton (with basil oil) appetizer was a standout. Wonderful combination of flavors and silky textures.  Main course: --Udon noodles with mussels/clams and bok choy.  This dish was OK. The briny flavor of the shellfish provides all the substance to the sauce. But where was the bok choy?  --Lobster ravioli with rock shrimp, chorizo, tomato jam and english peas was excellent. The ravioli is stuffed with luscious chunks of tender lobster and the pasta shell was meltingly tender. The shrimp and peas were cooked to just past raw, offering a wonderful counterpoint in texture to the ravioli. The chorizo really made the dish by lending a smooth smokey punch and fragrance to the dish. This one is a winner.  The final bill was huge.  Do try Elements for sunset cocktails and an appetizer and then, find your dinner elsewhere."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner following my afternoon wedding.  Called far in advance ( and had 3 separate conversations about our special reservation request) for a coveted booth reservation by the windows.  Accepted an 8:30 reservation as it was the ONLY time available that would work for us.......   if we wanted one of the very popular private window booths. Arrived early and had a delightful time on the bar patio. We should have left after enjoying a wonderful mussel appetizer and great wine! We were escorted to a dinner booth at 8:30... NOT  the booth we had requested by the windows.  We were \"perched\" in the back of the restaurant  in a booth overlooking the dining room. Not a booth I would wait for or request.... No one seemed to know that we had specifically requested a window booth... communication breakdown???  yet after explaining our frustration, the manager on duty quickly made it right. Our food was just ok... unusual for this 5 star restaurant!  Nothing was said to us about the lengthy wait and frustrating experience after extensive planning. Honestly.... this won't be my \"go to\" restaurant anymore."}
{"text":"It was very bad experience. I made a reservations one month in advance for my husband's birthday. I did confirm with them for having table out site at 7:30 pm. They did confirm with us one day before of our reservation.  The day of reservations, we went over there at 7:20 pm. Table was not ready and waiting time was one hour. Staff was not friendly.  I was so embarrass front of my husband."}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't already been said about the food, or the view? I know, I'll share the best part about my amazing birthday dinner at Elements -- meeting Executive Chef Beau Macmillian.   He didn't duck away when we made eye contact in the hallway, instead he broke away from his staff and came right up and introduced himself. He was so incredibly personable. He could have easily ignored us. I'm sure he's approached on a regular basis now that he's such a TV personality. But instead, he chatted us up and he talked about how he was so inspired by Asian food and how he wanted to bring that influence into his food and to Arizona. Before we knew it he was taking us in to see the latest renovations to Elements' kitchen!   He proudly showed off the latest upgrades. Sure, there were new gadgets, but he even included skylights because his sous chefs said they hated never seeing the light of day. How cool is that?  And to be revealed next month is an expansion to the kitchen that includes a table for 12 INSIDE the kitchen. Not a new concept for restaurants, but something Chef Macmillian is so excited about. There's no doubt that the food that he cranks out can be intimidating, but his latest endeavor speaks to his desire of having his guests witness the artistry behind the kitchen doors. This new addition promises to give you a full sensory experience BEFORE the plate even reaches your table -  from seeing, smelling and hearing what's happening in the kitchen to finally tasting the finished product. Talk about mouth watering.      Here's hoping that I will one day get to sit at that table."}
{"text":"Fantastic 5 course dinner last week with the phenomenal @chefbeau. Food was off the charts - presentation, quality, taste and consistency. Katie delivered stellar service.  The rose petals on the table where a great touch."}
{"text":"I was there on Valentine's day so it was busy. Still our waiter was attentive and friendly. The food was great - I was expecting less because was a busy night. We have to order 4 courses and I must say that my duck confit risotto and braised short ribs were amazing. Tried my gf's lobster bisque (ok) and ribeyes (nicely prepared but not extraordinary). Overall we had a great time- will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious the food was out of this world the serving was perfect and the view was awesome everything was awesome I will come back next time and that everybody know what a wonderful place this was"}
{"text":"Executive Chef, Beau MacMillan is a food rockstar! This talented chef has reigned supreme over Iron Chef America's, Bobby Flay in Battle American Kobe Beef. Simplicity, farm-to-table methods and a dizzying blend of Eastern flavors deliver a trance-like knockout punch. You've had spa treatments all day, you feel warm and fuzzy, then you take into your mouth a homemade edamame and roasted shallot stuffed ravioli with summer vegetable ragu & yuzu chive beurre blanc. Blow gently on me and watch me fall over with delight! Chef MacMillan combines elements to make masterpieces. Appetizers here can be stir-fried black mussels with sea beans, grilled scallion & garlic caramel, fiery calamari served with Chinese long beans & miso scallion vinaigrette, or creamy spinach and parmesan casserole with tomato jam & herb toast. No matter what you choose, savor the taste! The main course this restaurant is known for: everything! Bacon wrapped filet alongside freshly flown-in seafood morph the menu from day to day as only the freshest ingredients are selected!  Special note: elements has an urban feel. Hard to describe, the big-ctiy techno-pulse is detectable within the framework of this spa retreat. Shiny mirrored art objects and cyber-green colors set up the feel of a trendy 30-something bar. It just so happens the restaurant's \"jade bar\" mixes fresh cocktails with nods to mixology's past: cantaloupe martinis, eastern raspberry sidecars, and their Hemingway special are oft requested as well as non-alcoholic specialties. If you are looking to make him or her say \"YES\" to ANYTHING try table 41. It's jaw dropping views of the mountain will make your objet d'amour willing. Dining here is a true experience. From the ambiance to the gastronomic tempting, to the Moulton Brown lotion in the ladies room, every detail is \"elementally\" perfect."}
{"text":"This is the way to relax after a busy day of brain teasing. Their banana chocolate dessert overlooking the desert moon by the Infiniti pool is your eyes' ideal.   The ambiance is just perfect.  The people is not rowdy. Great spot to just lounge and talk about everyday intellectual stuff."}
{"text":"Usually go 4 to 5 times a year and dinner never disappoints. Awesome view great staff and ambience."}
{"text":"Went here for drinks and some apps with a girlfriend to catch up.  Everything was delicious, though pretty rich for my taste but that's just me and I have a sensitive palate..  We didn't have any of the main courses but I was full after a set of shared appetizers and a cocktail.  The service was great and the ambiance was relaxing for a friendly catch up but could be quite romantic with the right company."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, good for romance or business. Food was good, would go back again."}
{"text":"10/14/2012 I rarely write a review, but I feel in this case I must.  My wife and I decided on Elements (at The Sanctuary) for our anniversary after narrowing down our top 3 choices of highly-rated restaurants...anticipating it would be a special experience. I will write about the good and the bad.  We had reservations for 7PM.  We were told it would be a few minutes and the hostess apologized.  No problem...we went to the bar, had a cocktail, some friendly conversation with a gentleman playing in the band at the resort.  Our female bartender was very nice and attentive.  However, the few minutes turned into 45 minutes.  This is unacceptable considering we did have a reservation!  10 - 15 minutes I can understand, 45 minutes, not really.  We did have a great, romantic view at our table.  Our primary waiter was cordial, but appeared to be rushed and really did not take the time to review some dishes.  Not the way I would have liked to have been treated after waiting 45 minutes.  My appetizer, lentil soup, was excellent, unique and flavorful.  My wife raved about her oysters Rockefeller.  Her main course, was the braised short ribs which she also said were A+ in taste, texture, and tenderness.  After tasting hers, I agreed.  However, I had the \"rack of lamb\", the special of the day.  Extremely disappointing.  For a \"rack\", there were only 2 very tiny ribs, one of which was just about 50% fat.  For a $40 main course and a special of the day, I was embarrassed for the restaurant.  On a positive note, the vegetables were excellent and cooked perfectly.  Because it was our anniversary, the restaurant delivered a complimentary, very rich, delicious chocolate peanut butter mousse with Nutella which we shared.  A very nice touch.  However, not until we had eaten most of the desert did a new female server come over and ask if we wanted coffee.  Within one minute, our primary waiter came over and asked the same.  So, I was really not impressed with the food service considering the restaurants' reputation. .  The car attendants were very friendly and responsive.  Overall, my wife's experience was about a 4-star.  Mine, 1.5 - 2-star.  With so many highly-rated restaurants in the Scottsdale/Paradise Valley/Phoenix area, I was deeply disappointed in my dining experience here, especially for a highly anticipated, special occasion evening.  Not sure If I will be back here due to my disillusioned experience.  Frank S."}
{"text":"the food was great, nice ambience and view, hostess was not as accommodating as it should for this class restaurant. Slightly disappointing otherwise was pleasant experiance"}
{"text":"Our overall dining experience was wonderful, largely due to the spectacular view from our private booth looking out to Camelback mountain. The service was good, nothing exceptional and our dishes were appealing to our eyes as well as our palate. .... However, for the price tag attached to our dining experience, one should expect everything to be impeccable. From the linens to the ladies room. EEK!! That's where the truth lies! If the kitchen is as filthy as the restrooms, even a celebrity chef won't balance the scales. Come on, spend s few bucks cleaning up the ladies room, to make it a complete luxury experience!"}
{"text":"Great food, great wine, great service, and the celebrity chef is entertaining as hell.   If you have ever been to a restaurant where the food is made with care- and each dish balanced to the palate so that you can have the full experience of taste in your mouth -then you know what this restaurant will serve you. The food is thoughtful, modern, well balanced.   We were at a wine dinner for Red Stitch - an exclusive winery that crafts wines for those who have great taste- and that Chef Beau was able to get them to Elements is a credit to his sway as a chef. Their wines- if you can get them (and they have them at Elements) are amazing.  Scallops- perfectly seared and cooked, combined with a freisse salad with a bit of mustard provides a perfect balance of the richness.   Dishes I would never eat other places, I would eat here - scallops, fillet - simply because those are foods many restaurants do ok, but here the bar is much higher.   The view- my wife and I love it.   If you want to impress a business associate, client, wife, girlfriend, boyfriend- if you want an amazing  meal - with a view, and a world-class chef -- this is the place."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC! The sommelier Chris is so wonderful! The service was impeccable! The food...fantastic! We had the the tomato watermelon salad, the duck confit, the flat iron steak, and the BBQ short ribs...all outstanding! You can't go wrong with this place! Make sure you get to the bar before hand and get the fire martini with the jalapeño!"}
{"text":"The food and service was excellent, well deserved 5 star rating.  While it was a little out of the way, I'm so happy we were turned on to it!    Elements has one of the most romantic views at sunset!  And a stroll around the grounds is enchanting.    I highly recommend even a drink at the bar at sunset!   Amazing!!!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing.  We had a very large party so everyone had a variety of things and all raved.  The portions were huge, which you don't always see in such a nice, upscale place.    The only complaint was the the wine was not flowing.  We had to ask for refills or be stranded empty for a while.  Their loss, we would have bought as much as they can push."}
{"text":"We came here for a Birthday dinner, the view was perfect.  We had a great waiter and cocktails were delicious.  Unfortunately they had just changed the menu, (the old menu was up online) and we really didn't enjoy our appetizer or main course.   The bacon brussel sprout hash is actually a large cut (I believe he said stomach) which was not what we had anticipated.  The cut had very large fat deposits and the brussel sprouts were over sauced).  We also ordered 2 fish dishes. The sea bass texture was good but my husband didn't care for the sauce, the side of Chinese broccoli was pretty good as was the truffled Mac and cheese.  My fish was very tough (to be fair though that is just the type of fish and I truely wasn't very familiar.     They brought a complimentary dessert which was very good (butter pit accompanied with a lemon sorbet and mixed berries). And the most delicious chocolate chip cookies (I don't care for chocolate chip but I think these had ginger and some fall spices, extremely good)  Overall it was a mixed bag and I probably would have gone somewhere else had I looked at the current menu (the previous menu had duck which I was really craving!)"}
{"text":"I've been to Elements twice now, and love, love, love the views at sunset and the revamped patio dining area!   I have only dined here on special holidays with prix-fixe menus, so I can't comment on regular offerings, but my selections have been excellently prepared and presented, and the cocktails are fun and delicious!   I find the service to be little hit-or-miss--the first time, it was 5-star superb, and the second, about 2.5 out of 5, but that could have been due to large holiday crowds. I will definitely return when my pocketbook allows! ;-)"}
{"text":"I am a native from the valley and frequent visitor to elements. Unfortunately, feels like service is now inattentive, slow and not interested. In addition...the food was just ok. Although the view is priceless, will probably not return for meals but rather a drink before zipping off to nearby restaurants."}
{"text":"I made reservations here for my fiance's 37th birthday. We both have some food limitations - we are both vegetarian, and I am gluten intolerant as well. I alerted them of this when I called to reserve a spot, and I was transfered directly to the kitchen so that I could speak with the chef. I was very impressed with his knowledge and consideration of our circumstances...but I suppose I was still a bit skeptical (which I should not have been) that the info would not get relayed properly with our server/chef on the big night.  We went to the Jade bar first and sat outside with our cocktails watching the sunset. It's a really gorgeous spot to hang out.  I think any evening here would feel like a special occasion! It's upscale, but not uptight.....the servers and bartenders have a way of making you feel really comfortable.  After drinks, we went on to Elements and they had a great table waiting for us. Our server immediately spoke with us about our limitations and repeated what the chef and I had spoken about..I was very impressed!  We started out with the pumpkin risotto....which was to die for! I would consider myself pretty picky when it comes to risotto, and this dish hit the mark. Sooo yummy....I could have easily ate a tub of this stuff. Next, we wanted to share several dishes, and the kitchen was kind enough to split everything up on seperate plates for us, without making a fuss over it. I would again consider it a relaxed upscale dining experience. Our server was there when we needed her, but didn't hover....our water was always refilled and our needs were always met in a kind and prompt fashion. I didn't ever feel rushed, and we had the perfect amount of time between dishes.  Overall, this was definitely one of the top 3 dining experiences I've ever had, and would definitely go back! It's our new 'special occasion' place."}
{"text":"One of the best views in the valley.  Zen atmosphere and decor.  Uptempo lite techno background music.  The food was all perfectly cooked.  The tempura-battered fiery calamari was excellent.  The Halibut and Ahi was fantastic with very complementary sauces. Great dessert.  The staff was friendly and knowledgable...  ...always available without overly \"hovering.\"  HIghly recommended for special occasions and a \"splurge.\""}
{"text":"We went here for my brother's 40th birthday.  You know, when it comes to special occasions, places really let you down.  The food was ok, nothing special. And really pricey for what you got.  Server didn't know much about the food either.  Asked about a sauce being either smooth or chuncky, he said smooth.  Yeah, with chuncks in it!!!   Sat a long time between courses, also.  Like 45 minutes between entree and ONE dessert, for my brother for his birthday (that I had to pay for in advance, BTW).  Glasses and other dirty dishware sat on the table a REALLY long time as well.  All in all, we won't be going back there any time soon.  Too bad, too, it has a great view."}
{"text":"Thanks for the enjoyable lunch. I took a couple of friends to lunch at Elements last week and told them they were in for a treat. Neither had ever been there before and they were both VERY impressed. Both with the food, the ambiance and the spectacular views. I asked for special seating and it was graciously provided. Service was delightful. The group will be back soon. Be sure to try the Kobe Hot Dog on the Pretzel roll - that is my favorite!!!"}
{"text":"The drinks were very good  The views were very good The food was very very mediocre Do not recommend"}
{"text":"We love Elements!  Beau's cooking is so amazing and creative!  The ambiance is tranquil and elegant with amazing views! We go several times a year!"}
{"text":"Let me rave about my Kobe beef hotdog that I ate as an afternoon snack. If the rest of the food at this place is just as good, then this place must be awesome.   The view is awesome! The food was great! The waiter even was nice to take pictures of us!"}
{"text":"The view from the restaurant is spectacular -- definitely the high point of our meal.  The low point was the excessive noise.  This is a very, very loud restaurant.  It's hard to focus on fine food in such a distracting environment.  It might be good for a group but I wouldn't recommend this for a romantic dinner.  The food itself was okay.  Some dishes were good, but they were uneven.  First timers should also know that the New American label is misleading; the unifying theme of the menu is Asian-inspired flavors."}
{"text":"The total for the bill including tip (on top of service charge) was $1,250.  A group of 6 adults celebrating a birthday. Bottle of Veuve Cliqout Champagne, bottle of Cabernet, 3 courses. You would think for that amount I would have been wowed. Unfortunately not. Pros- 1. Amazing vistas of the Valley day or night. 2. Open dining concept with comfortable intimate setting. Cons 1. Service was slow 2. Food was OK, good flavor, nothing spectacular. 3. Desserts were just OK. 4. Parking slow valet service.  I understand the concept of elegance & refined haute cuisine. However, at the stated price point The expectation is excellence, not half steps.  There are other places I'd rather spend $1200."}
{"text":"Date night! We sat at a choice table to enjoy the sunset. Always great food and drinks."}
{"text":"My husband and I had reservations for 7:15 PM on a Saturday evening.  We arrived early, and sat in a comfortable waiting/ bar area admiring the view.  We were not seated until after 7:45 PM.  Our waiter was inattentive and did not take our order until after 8:15, after giving us menus and ignoring us for the next half hour.  The pear salad was the highlight of the meal, but the entrees felt \"forced\" - lots of ingredients, but not well integrated in taste and texture.  The lobster pasta was disappointing in flavor and overwhelmed by a tomato sauce.  We skipped dessert, as we did not want to risk waiting another hour for our waiter to reappear to take our order.  The restaurant staff apologized half a dozen times for being behind, claiming that \"tables had been taken from them\" but their constant interruptions ruined the atmosphere for our dinner.  Ironically, despite recognizing their error, the staff made no attempt to reconcile the problem.  Overall, this was a very disappointing dining experience."}
{"text":"I am still thinking about the miso-glazed salmon, and we dined there four days ago . . .   I am the kind of person who bases my reviews of a restaurant not only on the food, but the ambiance, and pretty much weigh them equally when determining my rating. Elements satisfied both those categories and more.   Just driving up to the Sanctuary where you are greeted by friendly valets makes you feel special. They ask if you have been there before and wish you a great time, telling you you'll have a special evening. Maybe that puts everyone in a positive frame of mind to begin with. The restaurant itself is striking. We arrived just as the sun was setting. We walked out on the deck/patio and watched for a few minutes. At the same time we were able to see the spectacular pool and grounds of the resort as well as the lively goings on on the deck. Everyone looked like they were having the best time! This is definitely the place to go for just drinks!   We made our reservation with Open Table. When Elements called to confirm, I asked for a booth with a great view, and that is exactly what we received. Our waiter was enthusiastic, but not over the top. We asked a lot of questions about menu items and he offered his suggestions. He was patient with my needing more time to decide, and he was not confounded when I asked him which entree was a better choice, when clearly I asked him to compare apples and oranges. Usually, I get the answer, \"which do you prefer, beef or fish?\" I like a waiter who is confident in manner and trusts that in either instance I will have a great meal so he's not afraid to give a direct answer.   On to the food . . . hubby had the Island Creek oysters and the elemental soup which was lobster bisque with corn. He thought the oysters were just perfect and the soup, which he didn't even offer me a spoonful, perfection. My cousin had the spinach and frisee salad, which she thought was so clean and fresh. I ordered the dungeness crab and spinach hot pie for the table to share. It came with perfectly seasoned taro chips. The \"hot pie\" was rich and creamy. One bite would cover Weight Watchers points for an entire day! Needless to say, we scooped up every bite with the taro chips and then used the spoon to polish off every last bit of it!   Hubby had the bacon wrapped filet of beef with garlic mash, blue cheese, balsamic onions, merlot demi glace. I did get a bite of his filet, and it melted in my mouth. Hubby said the combined flavors of the beef with the garlic, blue cheese and balsamic onions were superb. My cousin had the duck. She had a hard time making up her mind, but said that she definitely made the right choice. She was so happy. I can't speak to the dish myself since I didn't have a taste. I ordered the miso glazed organic salmon with skillet roasted vegetables, somen noodles, toasted coriander. I generally do not order salmon in restaurants as my hubby makes the best salmon around, but since our waiter said that they were known for this dish, I went for it. Wow! Perfectly cooked (I think this might be a first for a restaurant in my experience)! It far surpassed hubby's version (sorry :( ) Everything about this dish was top notch. As I said above . . . I'm still savoring it in my mind.   We opted to skip dessert, but they brought the check with three warm 5-spice chocolate chip cookies. Yum!   Elements is now at the top of my list for special occasions, and maybe less than special occasions. Do I really have to wait for another special occasion to go back? Oh, my birthday is in three weeks!!! You'll see me there!"}
{"text":"Third time I have been here in past 3 months.  Go to place for client visits with gorgeous views.  Service is excellent.  The food is great, wish the portions of fish were bigger.  I had Salmon Miso salad today and Ahi Tuna last month.  Both with lots of lettuce and little fish - for $22 please add more fish."}
{"text":"Wow!! What else can I say?? Best restaurant in the valley. The double cut pork chop is to die for!! Ambiance is amazing!! Views?? No words!!! Can't wait to return!!"}
{"text":"WOW what a treat.  Elements is a spectacular restaurant.  you really get a hollywood vibe here.  And the accessional celebrity will be seen there.  Scarlet Johansson has been spotted there.  The menu is outstanding.  the drinks are also so good served from the Jade Bar.  the views are worth the price alone but do not overshadow the excellent food.  this is a hot trendy slick place to enjoy a delicious meal in the Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"Truly delightful meal - food and drinks were prepared to allow each unique taste to shine through.  Beautiful view!"}
{"text":"Pricey- but amazing view and great quality food. If you have a special occasion or want a romantic dinner, go here. All the food we got was superb. Waitress can recommend the best things to order. Got a few appetizers and share them."}
{"text":"We recently visited Elements for dinner and some music. We've been to Elements many times over the years and the ambiance and environment have always been exceptional - one of the best spots in Scottsdale and Paradise Valley. The food has not always been on par with the ambiance, but the food on our recent visit was the best we've ever experienced.   The other pleasant experience is that the Angela Ferrari band was playing in the Jade Bar, and they were so great. Cool songs, super-chill and energetic.   Last, our server Ashley was very friendly and I highly recommend requesting her if you are in the Jade Bar."}
{"text":"Very disappointing food and service on a very special night.  The place is beautiful. The Jade Bar is really pretty nice.  But, Elements serves barely warm food and our server must have been on break the whole time. We rarely saw him. People came, ate and left while we sat there.  Oh yeah, big ouch on the outlandish prices."}
{"text":"Our entire meal was so delicious. I cannot recommend this restaurant enough. Everything has an Asian twist, which is so delicious. The calamari and oysters Rockefeller were probably the best I've had, because it was so unique. The lobster udon was so fresh and amazing!"}
{"text":"My GF brought me hear for a birthday dinner and I was very pleased. This place gets top marks for it's ambiance and view...no doubt the best in the area.  Do not, I repeat, do not miss out on the Karabuta bone in pork chop. It's absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"I was told this was one of the nicest places to go because the view was phenomenal and it really was; especially at sunset. We got there early and they wouldn't seat us early even though they weren't exactly full. The service was great and the food was delicious. We got a lot of snooty looks from the surrounding older folks who looked kind of miffed that we were there but I've never been deterred by a stuck-up environment. Besides, we cheated and ordered the prix fixe."}
{"text":"Elements- 5700 E McDonald Dr, Paradise Valley, AZ  in the Greater Phoenix/ Scottsdale Area.  The scenic ride up to the Sanctuary Resort where the restaurant is located is minor to the breathtaking view I was greeted with when walking into this restaurant for a first date lunch. From our \"table for two\" balcony seatting, was an endless view of the picturesques red mountains and cactus trimmed cliffs that Phoenix is known for. The seating was certainly romantic and absolutely gorgeous.  However the food on a 5 star scale sat at about 2.5. Although it was not \"bad\" it wasn't exactly amazing either, yet they had a menu selection to meet many various diets. I had the flank steak with a pomegranate quinoa,  which was great! However my steak was \"ehhh\" bland and dry. My date had a panini that he really enjoyed and was happy with.  I may come back and give them a try for dinner,  but the views, ambiance and impeccable service,  will definitely bring me back for at least drinks! Great for a lunch date!  Good for small parties  #az #Phoenix #Scottsdale #wheretoeat #azrestaurant #phoenixRestaurant #drinks #phoenixFood"}
{"text":"Gorgeous end to a trip in AZ. We started the evening out watching the sunset on the Edge with a great waitress, Amber. She also assisted us in getting a great seat in the restaurant where we proceeded just after sunset. Cameron greeted us with a friendly smile and lovely dinner suggestions. I got the Bacon Wrapped Filet... Amazing! The best meal of the bunch was Korean BBQ. It was out of this world!"}
{"text":"We loved Elements! We went there with some good friends to have a nice relaxing evening and the food, views and ambiance were incredible. It is a little on the pricey side but totally worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"We were with great friends, always a good start to anything. No, we don't live anywhere close to here, any of us. Initially it started off with a little unnecessary snobbery, okay bring it, my money is as green as yours is Mr. I Could Never Get This Chick If I Wasn't So Fabulously Wealthy; which wouldn't have garnered a mention until the valet guys fell all over themselves, not well played gentlemen my brother was a valet and I tip, ridiculously. Okay off to what matters, libations and sustenance, the server and service MEH, yes all caps are necessary. The drinks? They were nice, quick side note to the bartender (if the message was translated) when a customer asks for something a little more tart/sweet/less/more don't be offended, do it and get over yourself. The food was divine, everyone was sharing and there was nothing that was not worthy of a second trip. Although if the rating was for service alone, way less stars. Way less."}
{"text":"Love their food and not to forget the great camelback view! Great for lunch or dinner. Awesome service."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.   Food, view and staff was amazing.  We were one week into their summer menu.  We had few different options and all were fantastic.  Wine list had great options. Our server Anthony was great.  Look forward to returning for another awesome time."}
{"text":"Astounding view of the valley, amazing food, and excellent service. I went here with my BF for my birthday, and we got the bacon wrapped filet and kurobuta pork chop. Everything was cooked to perfection, beautifully plated, and tasted like a dream. Our waitress Denise was quite a character, we liked her service a lot.  Parking is valet, so please come with cash for tip!"}
{"text":"Went here for birthday dinner had a Moscow mule at the bar (delicious) then we were seated promptly for our reservation where we were moved to close to the window to see the amazing view (unfortunately at about 7/8 or so it's gets too dark). Started with the seafood platter, escargot and truffle macaroni for appetizers. Main entree the filet and the duck, everything was amazing and for dessert complimentary fresh baked cookies and cake! Service was wonderful I had a Bellini with dessert which was a nice bitter bite to my sweet dessert. Overall I had a wonderful and smooth birthday dinner."}
{"text":"We were in Phoenix this past week on our way to the Grand Canyon and were excited to discover that Elements was not far from where we were staying.  We had a 6:15pm reservation which was ideal as the restaurant was pretty quiet when we arrived had picked up significantly by the time we left.  The setting was beautiful.  As others have already mentioned, the view of the mountains as the sun sets is outstanding.  The service was by far the most exceptional part of our evening.  Service was exceptional on all levels (valet parking, hostess and servers).  Our server took the time to chat with us, made our six year old feel truly welcome and even gave us some recommendations of where to try for breakfast the next day.  The restaurant manager even stopped by to say hello which was a really nice touch.  Fine dining ultimately comes down to the food.  In this case, the food was good but not amazing.  The flavour profiles and elements of the dishes were well executed but nothing to rave about.  The highlight of our meal was the braised short ribs but was something that we could recreate at home.  The PB Bomb, which our server brought out for dessert, was really tasty and I would recommend this if you are looking for a nice way to end your meal.    So, overall, we had an enjoyable evening thanks to the outstanding service.  If we are ever back in Phoenix, I don't think we would return to Elements simply because the food didn't just live up to our expectations."}
{"text":"Dinner time at Iron Chef contestant Chef Beau Macmillian's restaurant.  first off the ambiance was outstanding!  If you come here during fall as we did, try to get there before sunset.  the restaurant overlooks the rocks and they look amazing as the sky changes colors.  for starters we had seared foie gras and the firey calamari.  Our 9 year old nephew LOVED the seared foie gras.  it was his first time ever having it and i have to agree with him, it was pretty tasty.  the calamari was excellent as well...  not too chewy, lightly crusted, and the arugula salad underneath soaked up the sauces very nicely.  for my entree i ordered the smoked pork tenderloin.  i ordered it cooked to medium and it came out perfectly...  i mean PERFECTLY!  the pork itself was packed with so much wonderful flavor.  then the buttnut puree add this wonderfully silky element...  so delicious!  i would order this meal again.  my fiance ordered the NY steak.  the butternut squash was sweet and balanced out the flavor of the beef well, but i've had better steak...  his cousin ordered the bacon wrapped filet which was WAY better in my opinion.  the mushroom hash was made with wild mushrooms and was very tasty.  i'd get this meal for sure!  the nephew's meal consisted of the kid's mac and cheese and fries.  i wish that he had ordered the truffled mac and cheese as their version seemed to taste like it was made out of a certain blue box, but the fries were wonderful.  as we were leaving the vallets chatted us up and very very amusing.  great personalities!  all in all we had a fantastic experience at Chef Beau's restaurant.!"}
{"text":"The place is awesome. I should go during the day, I guess because it must have great views. Nice decor, comfortable, a great ambiance.  The service was more in the not-so-great side, but no complaints. It's just that for an upscale restaurant I would expect a better service.  The mai thai was pretty strong but good. Bone marrow was interesting but the species and sauces kill the marrow flavor completely. The short rib was pretty good but the serving is way too big. The mac and cheese was tasteful as well but I would prefer it on the side instead of under the short rib.  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The food here was out of this world. I cannot recommend it enough! We were in Scottsdale last week for vacation, and one of the people at our hotel said that we should try here for the sunset. So we booked a table on OpenTable for outside so we could see the sunset, and it did not disappoint. The weather was absolutely perfect as we sat outside and enjoyed the sunset. I started my meal off with the Farmers Market Salad, which was absolutely delicious. The dressing was amazing. My parents for the calamari, and they said it was some of the best they have ever had (and they eat it A LOT). For my main dish, I got the Maine Lobster Udon, which was also fantastic. It was claws of lobster with noodles. It had a slight kick in the aftertaste, so be warned if you can't handle spice at all (like me). With our meals, we got 2 sides, including the brussel sprout and bacon hash, and the roasted shishito and cheddar mash. Both were amazing. We saved some room for dessert at the end and got the toasted marshmallow s'more. AH-Mazing!!! I can't rave anymore about how happy I am that we chose to go here for dinner."}
{"text":"My husband and I looked forward to celebrating our anniversary at Elements.  We have dined in many fine places and were looking forward to another great experience.  The ambiance is lovely.  From the valetparking adjacent to a lovely fire, to the window table and great view all waspointing to lovely evening.    It ended there.  Cold, unfriendly service, my martini overflowing, therefore spilling as I attempted to sip and then acceptable but not extraordinary food.  When I asked for more details on one of the appetizers, I was told it was the waiter's favorite. Had never tasted the wine we ordered and invited him to try it with us.  Obvious he had little knowledge about wine when he tasted.  Totally disappointing!  I could go on and on, but suffice it to say we will not return."}
{"text":"Beautiful surroundings and wonderful view.  Good service although not necessarily outstanding. Inconvenient parking,  including if you use valet (slow,  crowded,  understaffed,  inattentive).   Good flavors and nice presentation of the food but but overpriced for the portions and quality.  The \"Asian influence\" is way over played.  Sorry Bo, nothing like the flavors, smells,  textures,  ingredients you'd actually get in Asia.   If it were not for the setting I wonder if Elements would survive in Scottsdale with all the other amazing choices. Time to update the menu with better and more interesting selections.    Although only two check-ins on yelp, we've been here more times,  enough to see a disappointing contrast to other great restaurants .   If you have to offer specials on Groupon it's time to recognize there may be a problem."}
{"text":"First of all, Elements should be $$$$ on yelp and not $$$.  Our bill per head (of course with alcohol) in a private room was ~$370/person for three course meal. We had 30 guests. Do the math...haha!  We also dined in the main dining room, and per head was about $125/person.   Overview of booking and finalizing dinner for private room: Christine and her staff were wonderful to work with. They were very accommodating, esp when I wanted the room to be set up a certain way.  At times, it was difficult to get a hold of her since she's so busy. She is actually doing two jobs!   Onto the food I ordered: 1) Farmers market salad: 3/5 this was just OK  2) Miso glazed salmon- 5/5 WOW, this dish is phenomenon!!!! Our guests were raving about this dish and said this was one of the best salmon dishes ever!!!!  3) Hoisin braised short ribs - 5/5 another WOW, delicious! Just the right portion!!   I skipped dessert since I was so full. After 2 hours, I regretted not ordering desserts...hahah"}
{"text":"Sorry for my lateness but I wanted to update everyone that after my review I was contacted by management, apologized to, and asked back for another chance. I WILL be back just as soon as it cools down and update my review then.  Everyone deserves a second chance to make things right.  I appreciate the professionalism and attention to customer service. I'm looking forward to it."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in the valley! The chefs at this restaurant seem to never be able to make anything that isn't good, one of the most consistent places for good food and unique dishes. The atmosphere here is great and the cocktails are as well. If I had to have a last meal in my life it would probably be something from here."}
{"text":"Amazing dinner in the indoor/outdoor room overlooking the pool. Gorgeous magical setting. The food was fabulous. I dream about the truffle mac and cheese we had.  The service was outstanding as well. Katie went above and beyond for us!"}
{"text":"Went here with my boyfriend when we visited for a weekend trip this past Memorial Day.  We stayed pretty close by in Scottsdale and went to Elements TWICE;  once for dessert and once more the day after for lunch.  The food was excellent.  The presentation of the food fit the taste.  I had the three sherbets for dessert and that was mighty tasty.  My boyfriend had this cake that was sinfully delish! We also had the shrimp.. yum!  The next day for lunch, I had a tofu entree.  My boyfriend had the scallops.  He couldn't stop raving about them for weeks.  The lighting and the cozy booths were perfect for our occasion.  At night, it was dark and our table faced the window.  It was nice to look out into the night sky and over the city.  The next day, we had a booth in a similar location overlooking the same view we had the night before.  It was nice to see what we couldn't at night and see all the sunny mountainous land.  Both times, the atmosphere was so relaxing that we did not feel time fly by.    It was so serene and memorable.  I love this place and I will definitely go back when I'm in the Paradise Valley area again!"}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY ADORE THIS RESTAURANT!!!! Amazing location and such a great food !!! Been going there for a long, long time! I have yet be even slightly annoyed. BLISS! They wait on you hand and foot, food presentation and TASTE is Fantastic...Always make you feel very special.. the hostesses are not rude nor snooty and are always smiling- GREAT Managers! LOVE them all around! ( and I AM SUPER PICKY ( and Proud of it!) DO IT!!! GO THERE!!!!! #1 rest. per me in AZ for beautiful location and food!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful lunch here with GREAT cocktails. The atmosphere is serene, service nice and my salad was fresh and light. Can't wait it try dinner!"}
{"text":"Yeah, I know...only three stars.  Let me explain before you get all up in my grill about it.  Two years ago, this review would have been five stars, no problem.  But alas, it is not two years ago any more, and our last visit may have been our last visit.  Not that is was catastrophically horrible, but it just didn't pack the same punch it once did.  From the first greet by the valet dudes to last farewell, everyone is super nice.  But the problem for me was the waiting and the food...the server came by to say hello, and then we waited.  And then he came back and we got our drink orders in...and waited.  Then he finally came back and we got to order our food: don't remember what my woman ordered, but I decided on the filet (yeah, I know meat?! It was a while ago) and we both ordered salad to start.  The salad was good, had some tasty beets, nothing too cray cray.  It took a long time for the entrees to come out, all the while our server seemed to be too busy to check in much and stuff was taking forevs.  Look, I get it, I'm in the restaurant industry too...but I ordered my steak medium rare peeps.  When it finally did arrive I was pretty disappointed.  In the middle it was kind of medium and outside it was more like medium well to well done.  WHAT?! BLASPHEMER!!!! The bacon that was wrapped around it was pretty foul and the bleu cheese that sat atop was just meh.  We haven't been back since and I have to say, I thought about this place for Valentine's day and when I thought back to this lackluster experience, it helped me decide on another restaurant instead."}
{"text":"Top notch. Amazing service, food, and class. The view does not hurt either ;). One of the best of the best in all of Phoenix/Scottsdale. Filet mignon is my pick."}
{"text":"Loved this place. We went here for a snack at the bar, dinner and breakfast. Everyone was so nice. The atmosphere is laid back, but modern and romantic. I definitely want to come back again. The menu had a great selection.   Drinks:  I'm a sweet drink/bourbon girl. I can't remember everything in the drinks. They were good though. I had the cantaloupe, it had Tito's Vodka and watermelon liqueur. It was sweet but not overly sweet.  The fiery mandarin had the perfect amount of spice. There was a serano for a bit of heat, Tito's vodka, cranberry juice, among other things.  The Bloody Mary was average, it was extremely thick. We asked them to make it spicy. It could have used some hot sauce and spicy green beans. I don't think there's a lot of depth to their Bloody Mary mix. It was decent though.  The old fashioned had great flavor, if you love bourbon. It's not a sweet drink, so if you're craving something a little stronger I'd definitely get this.   Apps:  Foie gras with pineapple cake: omg. It was literally perfect. I wish I had it more than once. It had this amazing honey ginger broth. I never had pineapple with foie before, but it was a great decision. The flavors complemented each other well.  Calamari: It was nothing special, I order it everywhere I go. It was called \"fiery\" but it wasn't even mildly spicy. It wasn't terrible, it just tasted like calamari you can get at any sushi bar.   Soft shell crab steamed bun: omg. You need to eat this. Crispy soft shell crab is combined with kurobuta pork and topped with pickled veggies on a steamed bun. It's like a banh mi, but better. Or if it suits you better, the best asian taco you could eat.   Bison carpaccio- subtle and mild flavors combining with bold, pungent blue cheese. If you love blue cheese, you'll love this. The carpaccio was a little overpowered by the blue cheese as it is very thinly sliced (obviously). I liked the peppery arugula with it, and the marble rye crisp. The combination of textures was fabulous. The bison wasn't overly gamey. I thought there was a chance it might be. I've never had bison before but I found it thoroughly enjoyable, and yes, I love blue cheese.   Entrees- Lobster Udon: richly spiced sauce with thick noodles, veggies, and big pieces of lobster. The sauce was a bit too rich for my taste, but it had great flavor. I don't remember all of the flavors since I only had one bite.   Hoisin braised Short ribs: literally everything you'd want short ribs to taste like. I felt like it was nothing short of short rib perfection. All of the flavors complemented everything perfectly. If I could eat this every day, I would. They were mildly sweet with the hoisin. The Japanese yams were mild and blended with the shiitake mushrooms. The spinach cut a little of the sweetness of the hoisin. My mouth is watering thinking of eating that again.   Dessert- S'mores bomb: I wouldn't get it again.  Breakfast- Lobster Benedict. Not worth the price for lobster crumbs on regular eggs Benedict with avocado. The eggs were done correctly though. Some places struggle with that.   Green chili pork: Very nice green chili flavor. I didn't like the cornbread being on top. I wish it was off to the side so it could stay crunchy on top, not soak up everything and taste like cornmeal mush. It was good though. But I didn't like the texture so I wouldn't get it again."}
{"text":"After a very difficult year, my husband and I decided to treat ourselves to a romantic Christmas dinner here after seeing five stars on open table. We signed up for a farm to table experience. When we arrived at 6:30 the sun had gone down and sadly, took with the view with it. Our entire experience felt impersonal, rushed, and as if we were a part of a large banquet. There were no Christmas decorations, no Christmas music or cheer, and there was no one announcing what we were eating when the food was served. The menu was a four course meal excluding alcohol and the bill came to $280 for the two of us. The food was good but was severely overpriced. On the way out no one wished us a happy holiday or a good evening. All in all we had a very sad experience with good food. It is very unfortunate as we are locals that would have enjoyed making this place our new favorite get away for a great meal."}
{"text":"Ok, let's start with the good stuff (which was not readily apparent when I arrived). Elements gets snaps for:  Suggesting on the bottom of the menu that people turn off their cell phones A decent wine selection, including good by the glass options (perfect for the lonely traveler) Having foie gras on the menu since it's all but disappeared most places The views do indeed seem to be good You can sit at a 'community table' to meet fellow lonely diners  Back to the story: the restaurant isn't so much off the lobby as it is *in* the lobby. This is bad because you don't feel isolated from the hotel at some tables in the restaurant, which hampers the ambiance. When I first arrived, the staff was mingling and chatting amongst themselves and took a moment to acknowledge me. This would be accepable at Mel's Place, but not at a supposedly high end restaurant. The decor was obviously trying hard to be asian inspired, but misses the mark of being really beautiful or even cohesive.  The menu didn't inspire me. I'm not really a picky person, but the combinations just didn't sound good for the most part, or inlcuded something I don't like. I usually see 5 or 6 things at a restaurant that I want to try, but I had to look it over twice to find anything that sounded appealing. I finally settled on the swordfish with chorizo, shrimp, black beans and a morrocan cream sauce. I had ordered the foie gras as soon as the waitress came by and later found a Franciscan Merlot that turned out to be quite good.  The foie gras came out and it was absolutely wonderful. I was a bit worried as I really like crisp toast and liver that's been prepared so that you can actually smear it across the toast. This came on a somewhat soggy something called French toast and had been pan seared so that only the inside was creamy. However, it was still a delight to eat and I would go back just to get this $23 appetizer. Based on the implausibly good experience here, I was now more excited about dinner.  Then my entree arrived. I saw a piece of chorizo, which I love, so I speared it immediately. It was way over-cooked and not really spicy. In fear, I quickly tried the shrimp. It was also way over-cooked. The dish also came with tomatoes, which I hate and would swear weren't listed on the menu. The black beans were almost totally tasteless, which is near impossible, since the black beans I get in a can for like 50 cents taste better than this. The swordfish, oddly, was cooked perfectly and tasted buttery and delicious. However, as a complete dish it was an utter failure.  Based on the lackluster service, imperfect ambiance and ok to mediocre food, this place gets 2 stars on the value for your money scale. I'll go out and spend $150 on dinner for myself. But I expect the whole experience to be over the top. Here I spent $90 including tip and have had better food and service at Red Robin. In fact, I consistently get better food and service at Red Robin."}
{"text":"My family has always enjoyed Elements restaurant and go there for special occasions. Had my wife's 70th birthday with all the kids and guests in town and went there.  It had its usual GREAT environment, however I ordered  the double pork chops which sounded good. My daughter copied me and ordered the same.  When it came it was about 4\" thick with two bones, and the meat was all dried out and had no taste. Mine was ordered medium rare and there was no pink and no juice whatsoever. Totally tasteless.  I did not complain as didn't want to hold up the entire table, however when we asked for take home packages the waiter scooped them both up (one bite taken out of each.....and did not even bother to ask if everything was okay. He just scooped it up and put it in a sack.   $40.00 each for those two pork chop meals, and they were not edible!!. If you go there AVOID the pork chops and I do not intend on returning again.  Two of the nine diners went hungry despite a $900.00 bill.   $100Waiter deserves no credit either."}
{"text":"Picture this: a warm, intimate, 5-star dinner... watching the Arizona sun setting on the mountains. Elements MADE my cross-country trip to AZ worth wile."}
{"text":"The food was disappointing for a fine dining restaurant. Best to dine here for lunch or early dinner because the ambiance is view based and at night the view is nonexistent. Overlooking a picturesque mountain on a moonless night with a few dimly lighted homes in the distance is not a view at all. The PB Bomb desert was a bomb. Just buy Reees's Pieces candy and you will have a better desert. Overall I cannot recommend this place for dinner. Perhaps lunch with the spectacular daylight view would be OK. Overall a Zagat (26,28,25) and Gayot (14/20) overrated restaurant."}
{"text":"As NYE approaches, the holidays are filled with addictions you have to get out of the way before we \"change\" our ways.  So, I had to revisit Elements once I heard mac and cheese was back on the menu.  While it was missing, I had come think Rusconi's American Grill had the better mac.  Well, truffle still wins in my book and keeps it number one by shavings."}
{"text":"After hearing good things about this place, I made reservations here for the BF and I for our anniversary dinner.  I wanted Chinese food but he insisted on a nicer place for our day. So...  I'm going to say that honestly, I was a bit disappointed.  The food was okay and the service wasn't that great.  But the ambiance/setting of this place is amazing.  We were seated in a private booth that looked out into the desert/mountains and it was quite romantic...................until I heard the banging of metal trays literally right next to my ear.  Our booth happened to be next to a kiosk/station where the servers stacked serving trays and water refills.  Like, seriously?  For a nice place like this, I don't think serving trays should even be kept near the dining area, let alone RIGHT NEXT to a dining booth. Although it was sort of off putting, it didn't bother me much until I realized we had been sitting there for 15 minutes and our server still didn't come by.  When he finally came, his tone was neither apologetic or welcoming, it was just a dull \"Hi, how are you today?\"    We ended up ordering the Fiery Calamari as an appetizer which was pretty good.  Definitely beats Mastro's City Hall calamari. The sauce drizzled on the calamari was like crack.  This was probably my favorite dish of the night.  For the main course, I ordered the Filet Mignon \"Peppersteak\" - the texture of the meat itself was super tender and cooked perfectly.  I liked the potato fritter that came with it, as it provided a nice textural contrast to the softness of the steak.  I wish there was a bit more of it though.  The overall flavoring/sauce was just okay, nothing memorable.  My boyfriend ordered the Wagyu Skirt Steak - again, the meat was cooked perfectly but the other components of the dish confused me.  The foie gras by itself was delicious, but very rich. With that being said, it was sitting right next to a heap of bone marrow.  I wish there was some kind of crunchy component to the dish to help offset all the mushiness and rich flavors.  Our server didn't really check to see how we were doing or if we liked our food til we were pretty much almost done with everything.  At the end of the meal, he brought us a complimentary dessert for our anniversary but I'm pretty sure the restaurant does that for everyone dining on a special occasion.  I feel like if I'm eating at a place that is $60+ per person, then the service should be exceptional.  I've had better service at a Red Robin.  In fact, the valet guys up in front of the restaurant were more welcoming than our server.  Oh and then on top of that, there was a man in a suit walking around who I think was the manager and he walked by our table a few times and looked at us and didn't say anything, yet he chatted up a storm with the table next to us and BOWED to them and wished them a happy dinner .... on the last time that he walked by our table, I purposely made eye contact with him to see if he was going to say anything and he merely half-smiled at me and almost walked away because he walked past our  table already - then he decided to look back and say HAPPY ANNIVERSARY!  Gee, thanks.   Then, as we were walking out to leave, he said HAPPY ANNIVERSARY!  THANK YOU VERY MUCH! HAPPY ANNIVERSARY! all genial and loud.    I felt like I was in a bad relationship where I'm ignored by my boyfriend and then to make up for being a crappy boyfriend, he showers me with affection all of a sudden to make up for the crappyness.  ... if that makes sense.."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I have had in a long time, had the Butterfish (a great Japanese fish), the service was top notch and the ambiance is one of the best I have ever experienced. The view from our table was incredible, this place hits on all fronts. Too bad its so far from NYC :)"}
{"text":"Amazing setting, spectacular views, great atmosphere and suburb service. Ideal spot for romantic or intimate dining experiences, but great for a group outing as well. Highly recommend you gaze through the wine list of many great choices. Menu is fantastic. LOVE!"}
{"text":"We ate here during a visit in May, and had a great time. The staff was wonderful. A shout out to the hostess. My husband is a chatty guy and within minutes we learned that the hostess's mother and I share the same name. Then on our flight out of Phoenix we were seat mates with one of the young cook's mother, who was a great seat mate! So it was a meal that was meant to be! Great scenery, great salad, grilled portobello panini and the kobe hot dog. We look forward to returning when we get back to visit family again in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Stayed at the resort for July 4th weekend, Ate at Elements for breakfast, lunch, and dinner! Service, food, and quality was top notch, couldn't ask for more! Chef Baeu and his team have done an amazing job and we can't wait to come back! Two Thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in The Sanctuary, a posh mountainside spa and resort. Prices for midday lunch at the bar were reasonable, but our waiter was terribly slow and unattentive w/ no good excuse. Other patrons noticed and he started comping things, but unevenly. We ate at the bar - the caesar salad and sandwich (which they did graciously split for us) were both, fine, but nothing to write home about.  It had a cool little vibe I guess and in a really pretty hotel."}
{"text":"Went to dinner last night with some friends to enjoy a birthday celebration. Although the food was very good but the service left much to be desired. The waitress and the bus boy did a great job insulting our party of four.  When we were first seated the bus boy came up to our table and asked which type of water we would like. We asked for regular water with ice and a slice of lemon for the table. The waiter's expression quickly changed to one of utter disgust, I kid you not, and he said in disdain \"You want just regular tap water?\". I did not feel that he is in any place to judge our water drinking preference. We had already ordered our glasses of wine at the bar and had brought them to the table. Some regular water on the side is all we needed.  We were also celebrating a birthday that night. The waitress brought over a dessert with a candle for the celebration and then charged us $10 for it. WE NEVER EVEN ORDERED IT, SO WHY CHARGE US.  The waitress had a poor attitude and over charged a couple of items that we ordered but we didn't make a fuss and paid whatever.  The food was excellent, but I would never be back because the experience was average at best. I am so tired of snooty and pushy waiters who think they know all about fine dining. If you're in the hospitality business, best learn how to be courteous and gracious to your guests."}
{"text":"Wow, what an amazing place to have some quiet time on Sunday.  truly relaxing.   2 quick tips though, just from being in the industry myself:  Make sure the person bringing the food knows what it is and if I'm wearing black, please bring me a black napkin; I don't want to have to ask for one by the time my food arrives. I also feel like their menu changes often?  I'm not 100% sure about that, but I had \"favorite\" there about a month ago and came back for it and my server had no idea what I was talking about.  I understand menu changes though, so no biggie, I guess.  Other than that the food is fantastic & the service is great!  HALF OFF ALL BOTTLES ON SUNDAY!"}
{"text":"The best dining experience in Phoenix hands down! Chef Beau is by far the most friendliest chef and his spin on dishes makes for some memorable eats. We love to dine here for special occasions as the views are gorgeous the staff is always friendly and accommodating. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Our waiters Greg and Kacey made our most recent trip here one of the best evenings out. We got to watch the kitchen in live action and Sous Chef Chris can really command his staff with such ease. The best experience and will continue visit."}
{"text":"This review is for the dining experience not the resort which I would rate much lower. The food at Elements is exceptional but you will pay for it which is to be expected for such quality and atmosphere. The menu is changing always fresh and full of impressive flavors with a wine list to match. Views are among the best in the valley so make sure you request window seating when making reservations which is also a must. I would highly recommend this experience to impress that special someone in your life or close the big deal, however it is important to note that Elements will remain one of the better dining experiences in the valley as long as they continue to focus on the quality of the food and those in the kitchen who prepare the dishes. If either of these slip then this place could easily become as overrated as the Resort."}
{"text":"News of Elements \"rebirth\" has been blowing up my Inbox for the past several weeks. So, somewhere, there is a PR person doing a great job of getting the word out.   The service was top notch, from start to finish. We checked in early and told the hostess we planned to meet friends in Jade Bar for drinks. About 30 minutes later (exactly at our reservation time), she found us there and let us know they were ready. She made it clear that we could take our time and that the table would be waiting for us.  Fantastic!  Our server, Mark, made an equally good impression on us. As we were curious, he gave us a complete rundown on the multi-million dollar renovation to the kitchen and restaurant. He quickly delivered our requested glasses of wine and took our appetizer orders. When we told him that we wanted to take a quick tour of their deck, he offered to hold our appetizer orders until we got back.   He further surprised us by finding us on the deck several minutes later to tell us the appetizers were nearly ready. As we made our way back to the table, our appetizers were being whisked in. Way to go above and beyond, Mark. Your commitment to our total experience was top notch!   The appetizers were great. Escargot dumplings, a fois gras mouse and roasted peppers were all extremely tasty. My only disappointment was the fois gras mouse, in that it was a bit light for my taste. The fois gras flavor could have been a bit more present than it was.   Dinner was fantastic. I had the short rib raviolis, which were wonderful and the samples I had from the other plates around the table were equally delicious.   All in all, a wonderful meal, made even more special by our company and by the attentive service we received from ALL of the staff we interacted with. If this is the \"rebirth\" of Elements, I'm looking forward to a long & fruitful life for this Valley gem."}
{"text":"Wow what a dining experience! My Husband and I came here on a Thursday night for restaurant week. The RW menu was spot on. For apps we had the pot stickers and pork belly buns. Both excellent in their own way. The pot stickers were meatless but so flavorful that you couldn't even tell and that spicy pickled jalapeño on top was brilliant. pork belly buns had a delicious almost pickled cucumber slice that complimented the dish perfectly. For the main course we had the miso salmon and the short rib ravioli. Generous portion sizes and both ABSOLUTELY delicious. The salmon was so clean and fresh and the caramelization achieved was beautiful. The ravioli had the most delicious tart and buttery sauce on top. We also indulged in a side of the truffle Mac which was stupid good and had plenty of shaved truffle on top. For dessert we had the cheesecake tart and the PB bombe. The bombe was so damn rich that we could only do a few bites but the cheesecake was refreshing with citrus on top and the crust was something that will make me salivate just thinking about it. To top it off, the view was stunning and the service was top notch- even saw the chef himself make an appearance in the dining room. This night out felt like a romantic get away just a few minutes from home. It's a pricey night... but one I will remember for a long time. Thanks Elements!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! I was so excited to visit as I read such great reviews.  My husband and I are from CA so we have seen amazing views but this by far was breathtaking! We sat outside and got an phenomenal view of the mountains during dinner with the sunset.  Love the oysters, lobster udon and pork chops!!! Reserve your dinner closer to 6pm if you'd like to see the sunset!"}
{"text":"Beautiful view and delicious food! Service was good.. They did neglect us a little bit but they did make up for it a little bit. Not too bad to where we wouldn't go back.. The lemon meringue dessert would be the reason we could go back, it was so good!"}
{"text":"There are times that it doesn't matter how much we pay for a fine plate of dinner, and this place is so worth it. The atmosphere is amazing. My husband and I celebrated our first year anniversary here and the view was very romantic. I recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Excellent from start to finish. Excellent, creative menu. Very good service with a knowledgeable friendly waiter. Sunset completed the evening."}
{"text":"Great food, great music, and great atmosphere.  Met relatives that are regulars at Elements at the end of a week vacationing in Las Vegas and Sedona. Jazzy band playing contemporary covers set a wonderful mood.  We had ahi tuna tartare, kimchi shrimp / tofu hot pot, and burgers. Everything was excellent. The tuna fresh and delicious, the hot pot outstanding with layers and layers of flavour. The burgers were also top notch. If we didn't have to catch a flight back to Boston I would have returned the next night to further explore the menu.  A+++"}
{"text":"Did not expect much, but the chef blew my mind. Great balance of flavors: sweet, hot, herby, just the right amount of salt, and crunchiness. Great service."}
{"text":"I gave my Husband a Gift card because I wanted to go there~ It was 1st Class~ The views, the service and food were all amazing~! Can't wait to go back~"}
{"text":"I'd give this place 3.5 stars if I could, but I'll round up.  The Boyfriend and I made reservations here this past Saturday night for our prom reenactment. We thought it'd be sweet to dress up in our prom gear and pretend that we were 18 again.   We arrived in suit and floor length dress and were seated as soon as we got there. The servers and staff didn't so much as flinch when we arrived because it's a relatively fancy shmancy place so most people were dressed up.  I ordered the eggplant dish and my prom date ordered the marlin fish dish. We also got the pepper side and he ordered an escargot and mushroom dumpling appetizer.   The ambiance - great! Romantic, fancy, greeeeeeeeeeeat view! It was perfect for prom.  The service - Decent. The server was helpful, but MIA most of the time. Took a few hand waves to get someone's attention.  The food - A for effort and creativity, but the overall taste wasn't to die for. But where else can you get escargot and mushroom dumplings? And roasted peppers as a side dish?  The price - This place is not cheap.  Overall, nice experience, but it's probably a once in a lifetime kinda thing. Unless we decide to go to prom again in another 5 years."}
{"text":"I've held off writing a review of Elements simply because I've never actually eaten off the house menu. This review is based on the sheer awesomeness of how Executive Chef Beau Macmillan runs the place and the amazing opportunities that he provides.   During the summer Elements hosts a Lunch and Learn, where they bring in top notch chefs from around the valley, as well as celebrity chefs like Robert Irvine.   I attended a Lunch and Learn event hosted by Geoffrey Zakarian, judge on Chopped and all around groovy guy. Over the course of several hours he whipped up three amazing courses (with wine pairings), demonstrating how to make each dish and answering questions. the atmosphere was relaxed and fun. Chef Macmillan was also there to answer questions and make jokes as well. What an amazing day!   While at the lunch I made reservations for another event, the Table for 12 dinner. Essentially 12 people dine in a private room that is directly off the kitchen, with only a few glass doors separating you from the chaos. the chef of the evening was Petite Maisons' own James Porter.   I'm not exaggerating when I say this was the most enjoyable dining experience of my life. The setting was intimate, Chefs Macmillan and Porter were on hand to discuss the courses, food in general and any other topic came up. The passion that they feel for food really came through.   The food was amazing, the wine was perfect and the company could not be beat. Hanging out in The Jade bar afterwards with the staff was entertaining and educational (thanks David for the taco shop suggestions!).   I'm completely blown away that Elements provides such amazing experiences. Based on this experience I will definitely return to Elements, and I'm headed for Petite Maison.   Truly amazing"}
{"text":"What an excellent Valentine's Dinner! My wife and I came into Elements for the 2016 holiday and were so happy we did.  First of all, when you arrive, they take your phone number so they can text you when your table is ready.  While you wait, you can go into Jade Bar and hang out.  When we were there, some excellent live music was playing, which we really enjoyed.  Second, the service.  You have a 'service team' that assists you, which I believe includes a Server and two Server Assistants.  They all make sure you never wait long for anything, and they do a great job of it.  Our server was incredibly knowledgeable as well.    Third, the ambiance.  When we were there you could look outside at the gorgeous scenic views, as well as to a beautiful fire pit.  It was all very relaxing and romantic.    Finally, the food and drink.  I loved the Camino Agave Cocktail, and my wife and I both loved the Calamari appetizer.  For entrees, she ordered the Salmon, I ordered the Pork Chop, and we were both very satisfied.  I highly recommend Elements for your next special occasion. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My husband and I made brunch reservations for our anniversary and we were very pleased with our experience.  We requested seats by the window and our booth was small and intimate and provided us with a clear view of the beautiful August morning.  We started off with celebratory champagne which was from a fresh bottle opened specifically for us.  Wanting something to munch on before our entrees arrived we ordered the pastry basket, which was quite good (and sadly did not come in a basket), containing chocolate chip pumpkin muffins, blueberry muffins, and banana nut bread.  However, they also offer everyone a fresh cinnamon roll (which was outstanding) but had we known they were going to offer that we probably wouldn't have ordered the pastries.  Oh well.  For an entree I had the breakfast chimi which was amazing.  It was bursting with flavor and was very filling.  My husband had the breakfast skillet which he enjoyed but he was dismayed at the small size of the skillet itself and thought the potatoes were a bit oily.  I had a separate side of potatoes which were perfectly cooked though.  After our champagne my husband ordered a Bloody Mary which he found to be very good.  Our server mentioned that normally for an anniversary they will usually give a complimentary dessert, but seeing as it was the early afternoon and we had just finished breakfast, we were instead presented with two delicious chocolate covered strawberries on a decorated plated at the end of our meal.  Our server also took the Bloody Mary off the bill, which was a very nice gesture.  The service was great (though I would have preferred if they replaced our silverware after the cinnamon roll) and the meal was well paced.   Our server was so quiet and unassuming; she didn't have a single snooty bone in her body.   The entree prices were reasonable for a brunch of that quality (this isn't The Good Egg after all) and it is a restaurant we plan on returning to even if it is not a special occasion."}
{"text":"My aunt and uncle had their wedding here and we are lucky to try Elements's catering menu. OH MAN!  Top of the line quality. I got a Truffle Polenta as an appetizer and it was superb. So well done. My fiancé tried their crab cakes and once again, it was just so fresh and well seasoned.  Moving on we had a salad which turned out very good. there're  fried Cheddar cheese balls, dried cranberries, bacon bites, watercress and baby spinach. So good. they also used the best quality for all ingredients.   For the main entrées, there're 4 choices: Miso Sea Bass, Hoisin Pork Chop, Steak and vegetarian Ravioli. I personally picked the pork chop. It was huge and so rich! I was pretty loaded with the appetizer and the salad, so the pork chop even though was very good, it was way too rich and I couldn't get through half of it. But it was very well presented and tasty.   The Miso Sea Bass was a hit of the night as many guests chose it. The portion was generous, everyone finished their plate completely and would praise it non-stop.   The steak, I heard it was also delicious and tender.  For dessert, we all got \"The Turtle\" - fresh cream cheese and airy whipped cream. it was so perfect.   For being an up scale restaurant, Elements does a fantastic job. Though my aunt and uncle paid almost 200 dollars per person. they surely impressed all the guests. One extra element I really liked about this menu is that, you get a very generous portion of the dish. That's not very common among upscale restaurants.   The resort was beautiful and modern. We all had a great night celebrating."}
{"text":"The menu was enchanting. The setting, looking down over the Valley from Camelback Mountain, beautiful. The service was very good. The food was lousy. It may be because we ate late for Phoenix (arrived at 9:00). It may be because we ordered badly. It may be because they had an off night. Regardless, my sesame coated sweetbreads might as well have been tired hush puppies. Very heavily breaded, no taste of sweeetbreads, sauced in an overpoweringly sweet, red chili jelly, and served on top of a bed of wilted turnip greens, it was awful. But it was better than the \"Eggplant spring roll\" main course which was comprised of three rollatini of thinly sliced, grilled eggplant wrapped around couscous with a few pistachios (I think), swimming in a gelatinous, overly thickened, soy flavored, sweet sauce that easily rivaled the sweetbreads'  chili jelly in nastiness. My wife enjoyed her pear salad but thought the devil fried oysters were very poor. She didn't care for the side of roasted cauliflower; I thought it was the best thing I ate. The bottle of Sancere we ordered arrived at room temperature. Our host seemed to enjoy her squash soup though I think she was so-so on the chopped salad. We've eaten at Elements several times before and I'm sure we'll try it again because of all the great things that so many have written about it recently. When we do I'll post a new review."}
{"text":"I took my wife here for our 29th wedding anniversary because she loves Chef Beau. We had cocktails in the bar and they were pretty spectacular!  Then we were seated right on time for our reservation which is always great. The wait staff was extremely attentive including offering to take a picture of us outside by the sunset. The soup was good and they were very nice to split it for us even though we didn't ask for it(and unlike other \"fancy\" restaurants there was never talk of charging for it). We had the tuna and calamari for appys and they were also fantastic.  Then the Lobster Carbonara (life changing!!!). And the Hoisin braised short ribs which were tasty. Ok.  Yes. We ordered way too much but other fancy places sometimes the portions are small. NOT AT BEAU'S!!!  I swear there was an entire lobster in that carbonara. And they gave us a very nice free dessert for our anniversary. Top to bottom this was one of our best experiences!  We will be back."}
{"text":"Elements has always been such a wonderful place for my husband and I to have a nice night out, we've stayed at the resort, had spa services,  many dinners, and loved going to the jade bar for live music and drinks.  I always refer friends and family here for dinner.  We had such an awful experience yesterday, for father's day, that I don't think I will be wanting to return anytime soon, unfortunately.  Underneath our table, I noticed an extensive amount of food and trash. There was bacon pieces and bread crumbs all over by my feet, and the walk-way to our table had similar trash and crumbs.  I counted at least 3 flies on the glass next to our table.  We had an 18 month old with us and she dropped her bottle and toys, which I had to retrieve from the filthy ground.  Our table was sticky and didn't appear to have been cleaned sufficiently.  There was not a table cloth on our table, so it wasn't hard to see the filth on the floor, nor on the walk-way.  Yet, I did not see one person on the floor trying to clean anything or apologize for the appearance of the restaurant.   In my opinion, Mcdonalds is a far cleaner and more well kept establishment to have lunch.  To spend $80 at lunch and be disgusted with the appearance of the restaurant is unacceptable.  If the dining area is this dirty, I can only imagine what the kitchen looks like.  I never noticed anything like this at night for dinner, but I'm wondering if that is because it is dark and could not see the filth...  Well, now it will never be the same for me.  For an upscale dinner or lunch, I can recommend several places that actually care about the appearance of their restaurant - Capital Grill, Dominicks, Ocean Club, Flemings, etc."}
{"text":"+ Stunning view +French fries were the most fluffy, airy delicious fries ever! +seared ahi tuna salad was light and fresh  +/-smoke fried chicken with sticky rice bowl was just ok.   +/- thai chicken salad also just ok nothing award winning about these two dishes  overall, pricey for what you get"}
{"text":"Great views and the food is fantastic. Love having breakfast there. If you want a quiet and relaxing place to enjoy great views and breakfast look no further."}
{"text":"After hearing that the chef was a iron chef champ I wondered where the chef was when our dishes came. Good but nothing special to me. I'm Japanese so I expected a little more asian flair to the dishes too. Using Udon noodles under salmon doesn't quite do it. Calamari was greasy like something from coney island. very nice romantic booths with a view of the mountains at sunset but it wasn't as spectacular like maybe a view of the sunset off the kaanapali coast. Nothing like that. Waiter was nice, service was good. Restaurant remembered that we had a birthday party person which was the best. I enjoyed my lunch at NoRTH 200 percent better than dinner here but the atmosphere and seating was better here. Don't like how the bar lounge seating is right behind the romantic booths. Kind of defeats the intimacy of dining."}
{"text":"Amazing views and the service was excellent.  Drinks were not perfect for this type of restaurant and I had to return my flat iron steak special because it had a very odd flavor,  however the steak my wife had was prepared gluten free and the wine was great. We will be back and I will order off the menu."}
{"text":"I like the overall restaurant service is really great food is was  on point the salmon was really good. Great views as well."}
{"text":"There are few places in Arizona where I will gladly hand over as much money as I possibly can for a consistently beautiful experience. Elements is one of those places.   The menu that Chef Beau McMillan provides is seasonal, fresh and delicious. The wine list is approachable and the reserve list is all that a reserve list should be. The scenery is second to none.   I strongly suggest that you call long before the night you want to dine and make a reservation for a \"Lower Booth\" - there is one in the lower left corner that has almost a 180 degree view of the Paradise Valley area and there's nothing quite like it.  I frequent this establishment more than I care to admit and I am very comfortable enjoying a meal by myself at either the community table, at the lounge bar (when Justin is bartending), or, I've even been known to drop significant \"coin\" on myself, by myself for a birthday celebration.   This place has it down! They understand service, hospitality, great food, Go with a date, and it will be the first of many memories, go by yourself and you'll be well taken care of...  Salud!"}
{"text":"Went for fathers day and quite frankly I think Beau is starting to lose his touch.  Nothing ever changes, Its always the same over the past two years. If anything lesser selections  of  meat and miniscule desserts.  Our waiter didnt listen to us, this is the second time with this guy,  I will never use him again. They stuck us in the back room and place was half full, I hate a 5* place with no table cloths, of course the other side does. The wine list is only fair.   Pork chop was dry, margarita was not made properly. When I asked him for just a little more tequila in the next he brings a double with still just a little tequila in it.  The evening was basically a lost experience.At these prices looks like more Binks, Christophers, Mission, Vincents, Petite Maison"}
{"text":"Food = excellent.  Service = a whole lot to be desired.    My friends and I stayed at the Sanctuary and decided to try out elements.  The setting is gorgeous.  The views can't be beat.  The ambiance is divine.  And all this is lost when it takes 20 minutes for your server to come take your drink order.  I will say that if you are willing to deal with slow service, then this is the place for you.  The food was EXCELLENT.  But having to wait for service, it just lost its luster.  All in all, please take a try.  But just be prepared to wait your turn."}
{"text":"Unfortunately not impressed with the food at Elements. Was expecting fine dining or relatively decent food. Shrimp \"slaw\" salad... was eh!"}
{"text":"Great view, really good food, nice Asian theme to the food. Good service. I would go back for sure."}
{"text":"The view here is spectacular especially at sunset-breathtaking.  The food was good however I can't say outstanding-prices were very high, however you're also paying for the view.  The hostess was sweet as can be, same as the person who served us water and bread.  However, our waitress was not very friendly and made us actually have a bad experience here.  It was my daughter's birthday and at the end she brought out a few small cookies, no happy birthday, no cupcake like the other table next to us received who were also celebrating their birthday.  She had VERY BIZARRE behavior and made us uncomfortable actually...she came one time to our table to see how we were doing-that's it.  The lady serving bread came several times and was very kind and thoughtful."}
{"text":"Fabulous views of Paradise Valley! Perfect for date or special occassion. Its a spa resort restaurant, so the menu is spa foo-foo, serving relatively small portions. Not good for the person who needs alot on their plate.   Not a huge fan of their breakfast, but the morning atmosphere can't be beat."}
{"text":"The pork belly hash is something I have been craving every day since I've had it there. You can Coke for a romantic evening or just for one of the best meals you can ask for. The food is better than the view but that doesn't mean the view isn't bad. The food is just that good."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere and the food was to die for! Can't believe it took us this long to try it!"}
{"text":"Chef Beau is amazing!! We travel to the Phoenix area once a year and have to make the pilgrimage to Sanctuary and elements!  This year the oysters Rockefeller were the hit of the evening. Being from Boston - I know oysters and these were the best ever. The filet mignon was exceptionally flavored and tender!  We had the pumpkin cheesecake-all I can say is the pastry chef is a genius. And can I say - the service was phenomenal... love Denise!  I cannot wait until next year to see what is on Chef Beau's menu."}
{"text":"I had Happy Hour with friends here last night.  (My one disappointment is that Happy Hour ends at 6PM here; what's up with that!?)  OK, it could have been my company, but I was so impressed with everything here last night, this will quickly become one of my favorite lounges/restaurants.  My Dirty Martini was perfect...perfect!  The waiter was so friendly and genuine that we decided to forgo the waitstaff service to return to the bar for additional drinks.  The appetizers were good.  But the lounge areas and the view were absolutely gorgeous!  This place has such a wonderful ambiance.  It is definitely a place to which I will return, and definitely a place I would like to share with visiting family and friends!"}
{"text":"This is my very favorite restaurant in Phoenix.  The service is second to none, the food and drinks fantastic, and the views from the patio are amazing.  It's great for romantic evenings, my family had Easter dinner here, and I've been several times for brunch with friends.  This restaurant is ahead of the game, and the chef is a true talent."}
{"text":"This is a combined review of Elements and Jade bar, because I spent 6 hours here recently on an indulgent day of eating and drinking.  Two of us met for lunch on a Thursday at 12:30, and were almost entirely alone in the restaurant for the duration. Thusly, our service was impeccable.   We both started with an order of shishito peppers, the soup of the day which was a light creamy lobster and artichoke soup (!!!!!), and an order of edamame wontons. We split our entrees, the braised brisket sandwich and the turkey burger, both of which were tasty and filling.  During the course of the lunch we also enjoyed a glass of champagne each, a half bottle of Sancerre and a full bottle of Pinot Noir, which we ended up bringing over to Jade bar around 3:30pm.   Bartender Steve graciously welcomed us to the sparsely populated bar and we chatted about drink trends and we ordered our first round: for me the uva bella and for Kat, the dragon's tonic. I thought both were delicious. As the afternoon turned into evening we started telling Steve what liquors and or what flavors we liked and he started created off-menu drinks for us to taste test. That was dangerously delicious. By 5:30 the bar was packed and we were well into our third round. I finished up with a moscow mule with extra ginger in it that did not disappoint and then abandoned ship in favor of going home to hold onto the floor for dear life.   It was a spectacular day with great company and a great Sanctuary staff. I would be back at that bar in a minute for anything Steve wants to mix up, he is truly as talented as his predecessors."}
{"text":"We had breakfast there recently.  I had the iron skillet and it was such a cool dish.  Such a creative presentation, if nothing else.  Two years ago we had dinner there and I remember it really knocked our socks off, though I don't remember enough of that meal to provide details.  The view at this place is second to none, to say the least, whether on a clear day, at sunset, or at night.  As someone else already said, it is a nice crowd there, and the decor is very tastefully done."}
{"text":"I spent most of my meals over the New Years Weekend eating at Elements. I was super excited since Chef Beau MacMillan is executive chef here. Since I got to try so many things on their menu, I'll go in depth for the things I tried.  First, I do have to start off with the fact that staff is amazingggggggggg here. They are so dedicated to keeping you satisfied and full. Ross in particular was quite memorable and friendly! For example, the in restaurant menu that we were given was quite concise compared to options listed for in room dining, but Ross was more than willing to try putting in orders that were off the available menu. Even better, he (and the kitchen staff) delivered! Also had some food and drinks by the pool side and it was still absolutely wonderful.  The best thing here are by far the buttermilk pancakes. I've had them for two breakfasts in a row and oh my goodness they totally melt in your mouth. My FIL was able to customize them with blueberries in them as well. The maple syrup is true sweet maple syrup (as expected from a restaurant of the caliber), but that combined with the butter made the pancakes super decadent. Definitely a must try.  The next best thing I got to try was the Korean BBQ Chicken Quesadilla with Sriracha Sauce that my fiance ordered poolside. The tortilla for the quesadilla is just crisp enough but has a nice bitey texture and its packed full with chicken with the heat from the sauce. It didn't really remind me of Korean food, but it definitely didn't taste tex-mex either (which is a huge plus because I'm not particularly fond of those flavors).  I had the Jade Burger and Fries. The Jade Burger is kind of heavy, meaty, and good but not particularly memorable to other items on the menu, but its probably the best burger option you get here. The fries, however, were definitely something I kept craving! Thick steak cut fries with a nice outer crunch, but potato-y inside. There was also a kick of heat to them, but I loveeee seasoned fries!  I actually ordered a plate of fries for a dinner via in room dining, and it was the best part of dinner. My fiance had the truffle mac & cheese. The truffle was fragrant and pretty much made the dish. The pasta was cooked well and the cheese crisp was salty goodness. My own meyer lemon & ricotta gnocchi was good too, but the portion was disappointingly small (five pieces of gnocchi, which was delicious otherwise), with more sauce and garnishes than I particularly cared for. I expected more lemony flavor within the gnocchi itself, but it was only really present in the form of dried lemon garnished among the sauce. Meh.  For one of my lunches, I had the Hawaiian Breakfast, and thank god I ordered it for lunch and not breakfast. I'm Asian and that's definitely NOT a breakfast dish. First of all, I was really anticipating the char siu pork! Although I did see some pieces of legit char siu pork, a lot of the other pieces looked and tasted like char siu bbq'd pepperoni stick slices. I was very confused. There was a lottttt of jalapeno honey & soy sauce that went into the rice and while it was tasty, it was also quite salty. I think I was also expecting more heat between the jalapeno honey and sriracha, but it didn't have any of the kick I was hoping for. However, breaking open the sunny side up eggs and mixing it with the rice really did bring the Hawaiian Breakfast aspect back into the picture.   Shrimp & Pork Potstickers are delicious. They're steamed, not fried, so i felt less guilty about eating them. The dumpling skins were cooked nicely, and the stuffing was very flavorful (more shrimp than pork flavor!) The miso butter sauce was a curious choice because it made the dumplings feel greasy. Most Asians seem to eat their dumplings with soy sauce (some with sriracha, others with wasabi), and I found myself wishing for soy sauce to dunk these otherwise bad-boys into.   Last but not least, my SIL & I were given complimentary cinnamon rolls with cream cheese frosting, and oh my goodness they were sooooooo good. They were soooo soft, and the frosting was sweet and creamy but not overpoweringly so. Thanks Elements!  If you're poolside, the strawberry creamsicle is a must. It's pretty much strawberry ice cream shake with vodka. The bestttttt creamy cocktail you'll have here.  tl;dr Service is awesomely accommodating, and food is generally good. Favorites were the Korean BBQ Quesadilla and the Buttermilk Pancakes. Asian inspired choices are a bit hit or miss."}
{"text":"Last night was truly delightful. The food and service was excellent. We got the calamari, quinoa dumplings for an appetizer. For dinner we had the short ribs, swordfish and brussels sprouts. The short ribs were definitely my favorite and the brussels sprouts...drooling still. Then to top it off we had the 'smores and the banana miso upside down cake. The 'smores were out of this world! The perfect blend of savory sweet.   One of my favorite parts about the meal was our server's assistant KC. What a class act, this guy had so much personality and added such a sense of delight to our dining experience."}
{"text":"This is a great, tucked away chill resort.   Upscale, but really relaxed.  We had lunch here on a Saturday and the food was great.  Asian fusion, but done perfectly.  The fried calamari they offer for dinner (but you can ask for lunch) was amazing.  First time I have had the sauce incorporated into the appetizer.   Really healthy portion that would be enough for a salad or meal.   The shrimp bento was prepared nice and the shrimp were huge.   The burger was awesome because they had a sweet/spicy Chinese mustard spread that elevated the burger.   The kid's chicken tenders were very good and big.   Never rushed and awesome property to walk around."}
{"text":"This was a very nice spot for a holiday dinner with my wife. Had a very nice view of paradise valley. You wont find a menu like this out there, with the different spices and flavors they use in their dishes. Its definately unique. Their signature drinks are hit and miss. Some were very good, and others were quite odd like the celery margahita. All of their dishes have an asian flare to it based on the spices/rubs they use on their food. The odd one out I would say was the chorizo and mussles. It was very good, but didnt seem to go along with the rest of the menu based on the falvors alone. I had the double pork chop which was phenominal. The glaze added that extra sweetness, and along with the slight char was awesome. The pork fried rice that went along with it was also very good, but would have been better if they could have mixed it up a bit. Not a lot of creativity with pork chop and pork fried rice in my opinion. It seems like allspice or chinese 5 spice seems to be a theme, and is in just about everything from drinks to the food.  Service was very good. Jim took really good care of us, and didnt rush us at all. Allowed us to have a cocktail before we ordered an appetizer just to sit back and relax. He also made sure not to rush us and made it on our time instead of his which was very nice.  overall: 4 stars food: 3 stars service: 4 stars ambiance: 4 stars noise: moderate"}
{"text":"I chose Elements for my birthday because it was rated one of 50 restaurants with the best views in the world.  We set our reservation for 5:15 so not to miss the sunset.  We were a party of 5.  Our menus were customized with the birthday celebrants, which added a nice touch to our experience.  First and foremost, we had the best service!  It was so amazing that I told the manager upon leaving how great it was.    Here's what we ordered: Blistered shishito peppers Foie gras panna cotta Maine lobster udon Miso glazed salmon Kurobuta pork chop Hoisin braised short ribs Salted caramel cheesecake S'mores  AMAZING!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The location, ambiance and setting are spectacular. One of the best in the valley. Over the years I have visited Elements perhaps 30 times or so, and the one thing that it has been lately is very inconsistent . The food is usually good and well presented. Where the place falls short is on the easiest part of the job SERVICE, SERVICE AND SERVICE. Visited there last night and the service was the worst we have had             ( horrible)the waitress looked like she should have been cleaning floors . Staff walked around not refilling water or wine glasses, the bread was awful , the butter a piece of ice and we had to ask for it. The waitress had an attitude, we ordered multiple appetizers and they all showed up at once. Not sure why I even left a tip, hopefully the 10% got someone's attention. They always seem to be in a rush to get people out of there , we were seated and done in 1.5 hours and $400.  It's really too bad and it will be a long time before they see me again. I suggest management train their staff and get rid of ones with attitude.  Clean up your act folks , appearances only go so far."}
{"text":"Just came back from a great evening at the Elements. Terrific ambience, service and food. Server Gary was excellent. It was my 75 birthday and my wife, sister and myself thoroughly enjoyed the evening. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great view, great food, great service ...reservations needed.  Top of the line with vallet service.  You will score points here!"}
{"text":"I have to admit I'm a little biased when it comes to this location as I got married at the Sanctuary two years ago. So far I've been to brunch twice and finally tried dinner for our two year anniversary. This restaurant has some of the best views in Phoenix and the decor is fabulous; modern but not too cold.  Dinner last night did not disappoint. We started off with some inventive cocktails, I had the Pepper Smash which was very interesting with yellow bell pepper juice and my husband had the Celery Superstar which had a jalapeno slice in it and was very well crafted. We chose the following for our meal:  - Ahi Tuna: This was fresh tuna over julienned cucumbers with fresh herbs and pine nuts. This dish was fantastic and a great starter.  - Lobster Mac & Cheese: This was my least favorite dish. It had a very good rich flavor and the lobster was cooked perfectly. My only complaint was that the consistency was a little off, the sauce was a little too runny for my liking and the pasta in the dish was slightly overcooked.    - Alaskan Halibut Special: This was a perfectly cooked piece of fish, seasoned right and served over a flavorful mushroom risotto  - Butternut Squash Dumplings: This dish was an amazing combo of sweet and savory. These were large raviolis filled with a sweet butternut squash, the sauce was rich with sweet tomatoes and was complimented by a savory goat cheese with roasted pumpkin seeds.  - Turtle Cheesecake: We were given a complimentary dessert for our anniversary. This was a cheesecake with a salted caramel topping and roasted pecans. It was very decadent and was the perfect amount.  Our server also made this a great experience (I forget his name but he said he was from DC). He was very passionate about the food and was able to help us with our choices, and everything was on point. My husband and I were very satisfied with our dinner, and will keep this on our list for special occasions, we will also continue to come for brunch. I highly recommend Elements!"}
{"text":"Superb service that flows with the typical services at the Sanctuary!  The recently renovated bar area is great for socializing. It's always crowded especially on the weekends! The staff is prompt and attentive. I didn't eat during this visit but past dishes were phenomenal! I did drink a glass of sweet reilsling as I listened to the tunes of the three-man band. Very relaxing ambience!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and customer service. My wife and I are celebrating our babymoon in a nearby resort and dropped in for breakfast at Elements. The french toast was amazing. There was a problem with our order and the waiter promptly resolved it. The manager came in to apologize and even took the dish off the bill. They gave us a to-go muffin to congratulate us and also dropped us back to our resort! Very impressed with the quality of food, the views of Paradise Valley and the top notch customer service!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were in Scottsdale for a business trip he was on.  The trip fell two days after his 40th birthday, and, as a treat, I wanted to take him to a nice restaurant to celebrate.  Elements did not disappoint us at all.  In fact, it far exceeded our expectations.  We arrived earlier than our reservation so we had a pre-dinner drink at Jade Bar, which overlooks the Camelback Mountains.  Though it was was chilly outside, we sat on a cozy couch next to a heat lamp.  The mood lighting was perfect, the noise level was perfect, the cocktails were divine.  It's a bit pricey, but well worth it.  For a starter, my husband had the Citrus Cured Pork Belly with a blackberry teriyaki sauce, which he said literally melted in his mouth.  I had the Butternut Squash and Marscapone soup.  If it wasn't inappropriate to lick the bowl, I would have done so.  I also had the Fiery Calamari, with banana peppers, and I was more than pleased with this dish.  The calamari was not rubbery and, instead, tasted like silk on my tongue.  For our main, my husband had the Bacon Wrapped Fillet of Beef and I had the Free Range Chicken Breast; we shared the Truffled Mac & Cheese.  I have nothing negative to say about any of these dishes, as they were some of the best I have ever had the pleasure to be served and pay for.  The service was outstanding, with our waiter (Ryan K.) being very attentive and making us feel like we were his most important guests.  We never felt rushed or that we were making him do something he'd rather not do.  Even when we were done with our meal and just wanted to rest for a while before trying to walk our full bellies out of the door, Ryan kept checking on us and told us to take our time.  We would have liked to meet Chef Beau Macmillan, but he was not working the night we went.  But that just means we'll have to go back to Scottsdale and eat at Elements again -- something I am not opposed to in the least."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service and a VERY romantic setting, the views amazing, all the windows/doors open to such a spectacular view of the valley"}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've ever had in my life. As a foodie, I am always trying new restaurants. Their dessert was by far the best I've ever had. The perfect spot for date night or a romantic dinner."}
{"text":"We go here often for special occasions- the food is great and service has been top notch. Tonight was bad enough to make it our last time here. We took a friend for a birthday dinner and waited 2 hours for our entrees to arrive with a half hearted apology from the manager, letting me know that wait was standard because I ordered the feature- scallops. ?????? They finally showed up after we asked twice after our food and my plate had THREE scallops on it. I think because we're young we were deprioritized- not treated with respect or urgency.   I know you have business people to look after, but you left the birthday girl and her crew in the lurch all night. Not cool."}
{"text":"What a welcome relief when a reataurant is as good as it's high reviews, but when it exceeds them, that is very special.  The element is a very special find and it will not disappoint.  It's breathtaking veiws coupled with one of their many signature cocktails is the perfect start to a guaranteed delectable evening.  Everythimg, from their fusion of flavors, exceptional presentations, and knowledgable wine pairings makes for a dining experience that will be hard to rival.  Request the private booths for special intimate dining with unmatched desert beauty views!"}
{"text":"Got a little lost finding this place up on the Paradise Valley Hills, but I love love love the food!  Had a 9pm dinner reservation. The restaurant has a very nice view of the PV Hills. It's too bad we weren't at the restaurant when the sunset. It would have been an awesome sight.   Service was attentive and not overly done. I wish our waiter was more charismatic with us in explaining the entrees.   The order: + Appetizer- Edamame dumpling with crab and shallots in a black truffle butter. Edamame was pureed and the crab was on top of each dumpling. Interesting texture and taste.  + Duck Breast with blueberry sauce and a mushroom risotto.  Oh boy. This dish was sooo yummy!! The sauce was sweet, and the duck cooked perfectly at medium. The risotto was such an earthy flavor with the mushroom. I love this dish.  + Rack of lamb with crab and rice nori cake in an asian bbq sauce. The lamb had a good peppered outer coating. The meat was overdone when cooked at medium. The rice cake was crispy on the outside, and sweet and mushy on the inside.   + Honey Walnut Cake dessert with a creme fraiche ice cream and blood oranges. YUMMMmmM!! The nutty and intense flavor exploded in my mouth. The ice cream was really light. I liked the extra touch with the dehydrated blood orange. It was a refreshing citrus flavor that was similar to a candy. Highly recommended!  + Pear Cake dessert with pears and mascapone mousse. The cake was a lot denser than the walnut cake, and the mousse balanced the flavor and density of the dessert. The sweet cranberry was a good touch. I liked how this dessert was not as sweet.  The entire experience was wonderful!!! Awesome food, service, and view. Great place to spend with a significant other, family, and friends :)  Other info: + Parking: Valet- but it's free. Just pay for the services. + Meal prices: Appetizers range from $10- $20. Salads range from $8-$12. Main entrees range from $25-$40. Desserts cost $10 each."}
{"text":"I was just here recently with friends - since it's winter, I didn't get to see the amazing view that i've heard about since it was pitch black by the time we ate.  The decor was nice and simple, but contemporary.  Nice spacing of tables.  Overal, the food was good quality with nice flavors, but nothing overly memorable.  I had a bisque to start which was nicely done with good flavors, and it was poured right at the table so parts would remain crisp.  My entree was the feature of the day - I recall it was a fish, but cannot recall the specifics.  For me, it wasn't a very memorable meal, but the food quality and service was reasonable for the price."}
{"text":"I took my girlfriend here for her birthday. The entire experience was incredible. A friend told me to make a reservation and ask for a table that faced the pool. The view was stunning. She had duck three ways, I had the most delicious chicken dish. The food was so flavorful and attractively prepared. We each had a couple glasses of wine as well. At the end of the meal they brought us a complementary \"peanut butter cup\" dessert that was Devinne! Apparently they felt that their service was a bit slow for us. I didn't notice, but I deffinitely was not about to turn down free desert! Ha ha. We will absolutely be back. Total bill tip included 165.00"}
{"text":"Went to Elements for the first time yesterday for brunch with some friends. It was awesome! From the food, to the view, to our extremely friendly waiter, Daniel, it was an experience I won't soon forget. I opted for the brunch buffet, which comes with complimentary champagne, phenomenal food, and decadent desserts. Everything was so good, and just when we thought we couldn't eat anymore, Daniel brought out sticky buns (let's face it, no matter how full you are, there's ALWAYS room for sticky buns!) I'm surprised I was able to walk out of Elements on my own after all of the food I somehow managed to eat. I will definitely be back -- and not just for brunch, but for a wonderful \"stay-cation\" since the views are simply breath-taking!"}
{"text":"A wonderful restaurant with spectacular views and excellent food. Our waiters, Cooper and Marcus, were well informed, attentive and friendly but never overbearing. For appetizers my husband had foie gras and I had the tuna tartare, both were top notch. For our main course my husband had the pork chop, which he said was the best he ever had. I ordered the chicken (I know, why chicken when there are so many other choices!) and I was just so happy that I did. It was delicious!  I wish we had room for dessert, but we  just couldn't.   If you can try to arrive around sunset!"}
{"text":"Had my boyfriend's birthday dinner here and they went above and beyond. The service and food was amazing. If that doesn't get you hooked the view is stunning. I would recommend this place to all my friends. It is expensive and romantic definitely  more of a special occasion spot."}
{"text":"Anniversary dinner. We both had the fillet of beef - and we mutually agreed that it was the best steak we have had all year. Of course the location and views are lovely; the service was excellent n. They have an incredible wine list. Even the choices by the glass are noteworthy and enjoyable   Definitely a spot for a special occasion - or a drink st the bar b"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful Mothers Day brunch.  It's about the ambiance as much as the food; it was a beautiful day.  We enjoyed the prix fixe menu and opted for mimosas to be included.  My mom enjoyed a mushroom and fennel tart, a wonderful halibut entre with mussels and risotto and her favorite,  strawberry shortcake dessert.  I had an excellent crab gazpacho,  salted caramel and chocolate french toast that was soggy...the toast was drowned in the chocolate and \"caramel\" sauce, so much so I only had a few bites; too mushy and sweet.   But I should have stuck to my inner voice and gone with another choice...  Un detoured,  I continued to enjoy the total experience of brunch with my mom and the beautiful surroundings and finished every bite of my passion fruit cheesecake dessert.   We were well attended by our waiter and unhurried.   Yes it was pricey, but no complaints.   Elements continues to be our go to for special occasions."}
{"text":"I don't know why everybody is raving about their service; frankly, I don't think it was exceptional, but I compare it to NYC finest restaurants and maybe it's not fair... I will give you a couple of examples and you decide if you can call this service exceptional. I asked for a raspberry martini and was presented without my prior approval with a raspberry mojito, which turned out to be very good, but come on, you don't substitute one drink with another without asking your customer first. Then our appetizers were brought with 1 minute difference, which is a big \"no-no\" in any fine restaurant. These were minor details, which didn't spoil our experience but I think you should know what to expect.  The view is truly dramatic and it's worth going there just because of it. Surprisingly, we were among few couples who turned their heads to watch a sunset; many people didn't pay any attention to it.   Highlights of the dinner were: duck three ways  and spiced venison loin. The dessert menu wasn't incredibly tempting for us but I enjoyed my warm apple brandy bread pudding anyway.   Will we return? No doubt! For now, Elements is one of our favorite restaurants in the Valley.  P.S. I forgot to mention that the service was fast, which is a big plus for us because we don't like spending 3 hours in a restaurant"}
{"text":"My husband and I got married at the Sanctuary resort, so maybe I am a little impartial, but the food and drinks here are amazing.  I would definitely recommend reservations before you come, and try to request an indoor table with a sunset view for dinner.  It is great watching the AZ sunset and then the city lights while you enjoy your meal.  The service here is always excellent in my experience.  We come here several times a year for special event, and occasionally for lunch if we are in the area.  I definitely prefer the dinner menu over the lunch menu.  The Elements menu tends to have a lot of seafood on it, be forewarned.   I am allergic to a lot of different seafood items, but I easily manage to find something else delicious to order.  If you love dessert, I recommend the peanut butter bomb which is my personal favorite, but you can't go wrong with any pick here in my opinion.  The restaurant decor is beautiful and has one of the best views in the city.  This restaurant is of course expensive though, and our meals for 2 usually top $200 for dinner with only a couple of drinks on there total."}
{"text":"First let me go on a rant.  I so wanted to meet Chef Beau and although they kept telling me he was there I never was able to meet him.  I tried three times, the staff kept telling me to come back at certain times because he had just left but it never seemed to happen.  Hopefully next time I will be able to meet him.  Ok, now on to the real stuff.  This restaurant is awesome, beautiful and classy.  The view is amazing day or night.  The staff professional, efficient and were great about using your name.  I wasn't feeling well (not sick, just drank too much, don't worry I wasn't infecting people!) and I still enjoyed the meal, I can't imagine how much I would have liked it if I was feeling better.  I ordered the Kurobuta Pork Chop.  It was sooooo good.  It was huge, cooked perfectly, a little spicy and had a wonderful crust.  For dessert I had the PB Bombe and it was awesome as well.  Very rich but you can never go wrong with peanut butter and chocolate.  I will totally be eating here again next time I make it to Scottsdale and stay at this amazing hotel."}
{"text":"Love the location and view, especially if you time your reservation just right to watch the sun go down from your table. Hint, request for the Howard Stern booth when you make your reservation-best seating in the house. The Jade bar is a great place to mix and mingle before you get seated and it is called \"Jade\" so it definitely screams s-e-x-y. Heyyyyyyy.   But...I'm not in love with this place nor their food. Something about modern furniture/outlay makes me feel cold. I know this place is suppose to feel zen like, but instead, it makes me feel like I'm in a small box within a large box. I like ambiance that has a little more romance and warmth to it...the cozy feeling that makes you feel all mushy inside and reminds you of your Grandmother. As for the food, nothing has been memorable to me except their desserts. I tried looking up their menu online to tell you exactly what I've ordered, but I couldn't find it on their website. I do remember trying a curry dish, which was pretty awful. I love curry whether it's Thai or Indian and this particular plate was just trying too hard to be everything, in return, being neither...not sure where they were going with it? The service is great, though and I've been here on Christmas day when it's super busy, yet never felt that way because the service was attentive.  I, of course, would go to this place again, but if I had a choice, I would rather go somewhere else. Been there, done that."}
{"text":"My reflections on my dining experience here last night.......the setting and environment are top notch.  The creativity in the dishes and ingredients, and the attractiveness of the presentation are also top notch.  I also believe that most of the ingredients are of great quality.  But is the taste outstanding?  I think not.  Not that it is bad, but I would have expected more.  Roasted oysters Rockefeller were mediocre at best.  On the other hand, my charred shishito peppers were outstanding!  My GF's filet was very good, but the accompaniments and saucing were only average at best.  I had the naraji and while I must admit that the quality of the fish was very good (I used to have a commercial fishing license when I lived in Hawaii), the seasoning and saucing was only average at best.  And the desserts were a big disappointment!  Price-wise I thought the prices were on the high side as was to be expected, but not outrageous.  While it would be unfair to compare the Elements menu to \"comfort foods\", I personally think that well prepared and well seasoned comfort food provides my palate with a better dining experience."}
{"text":"After hearing my girlfriend rave about how amazing Elements is I made reservations for VDay dinner. It was a four course set dinner ($115 per person) and boy was the food disappointing. We started out with a bruschetta that was bland and flavorless with a what seemed to be a canned artichoke heart on the side. Then, we were served a salad that soggy. Our second course was a crab bisque that was almost inedible. There was an overpowering ginger flavor that ruined the bisque. Our third course my girlfriend got Eggplant, Squash, and Quinoa Ravioli she ate one of the 3 ravioli and it tasted as if it was just an egg noodle and sesame seeds with a bunch of squash and eggplant thrown on top. I had the Short Rib and it was fairly good but nothing great. Finally, the dessert was the only decent thing we ate all night, which was a chocolate fondue. This meal was definitely not up to the reputation to say the least. They say and pride themselves on the fact that an Iron Chef runs the Kitchen, but the truth of the matter is I don't think this four course meal would beat Bobby Flay. In the end I can only see people enjoying this meal because they were several drinks in. My girlfriend and I are not 21... so I ended up spending $300 on a meal that disappointed both of us. For those looking to go to a nice restaurant with great food in the Paradise Valley area, try El Chorro. We went there for NYE and it was phenomenal. Oh and one last thing we had basically no privacy due to the fact that we were interrupted by water woman filling our glasses after just about every sip we took. It was beyond annoying! I personally won't be going back and wouldn't recommend Elements for Valentines Day to anyone."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic spot for views & a healthy lunch!  Love the Bento boxes...all under 400 calories & delicious!  Keep it up Sanctuary!"}
{"text":"I am usually overly generous with my stars, so I'm even shocking myself.  The one star is rated purely on the food.  If the view, great cocktails and cute waiter were taken into account, I could go up one or two more.  I ordered the bento box and my lunch partner ordered an Asian noodle salad.  Both were sadly bland and nondescript. In fact, it's odd that we don't lick our plates clean, so it's saying something when we leave food.  Perhaps we ordered the wrong items?  But in my opinion there should be no wrong items on a menu.  I did like their unique cocktails-mine a spicy concoction of citrus and heat..."}
{"text":"I took my husband here for his 40th birthday and we were both very impressed. The atmosphere was beautiful. We were fortunate enough to have a table near the window so we had a fantastic view of the valley at sunset. Our waiter was fantastic (not stuffy) and the food impeccable.   Obviously on the pricey side, but that is to be expected for an establishment such as this. Might catch a star or two. We saw Steve Nash at the bar."}
{"text":"Had dinner last night at Elements.  It was our first time there. We started out in the bar. I'm not a big drinker and I ordered a margarita. Jason, the awesome bartender, offered to make a special margarita for me. When he put this amazing creation in front of me, I thought he must have ESP or I had the words \"love strawberries\" written on my forehead cause this was a strawberry margarita.  Turns out he talked to my husband and found out about my strawberry obsession.  I asked him what he called it and he asked what my name was and the name of the drink was Leanne's Surprise.  Don't ask me what was in it cause I can't remember but it was wonderful.  Thanks again Jason.  We then went to the dining room and our table was in the far corner with floor to ceiling windows on both sides. Best inside table in the whole place. The views are beautiful. Next time I go I will try for sunset.  I ordered their off menu special the NY Strip. I'm normally a filet kind of gal but I wanted the potatoes and shrimp as well. So our server did the bacon wrapped filet with the sides of the special. So happy he did that for me. It was amazing. I posted a picture of it.  The desserts our table shared was the Peanut Butter Bomb and the Pretzel Bar. Both were incredible.  Elements is pricey so I'd say this is a special occasion type place, for me.  Looking forward to coming back and having the Leanne's Surprise margarita!"}
{"text":"We had friends visiting from CO, ID & CA, so 7 of us for dinner.  I had never been to Elements, so I was excited to take my friends.  3 out of 7 sevens dinners were wrong, very disappointing at these prices.  One of the steaks was grossly over cooked, we sent it back, didn't see that plate until everyone else was done.    They offered free desserts, not impressed at all, we won't be back."}
{"text":"On my visit to Arizona I was very pleased with this restaurant. My friend and I were looking for great food with a view and we absolutely got what we payed for. Located at the Sanctuary on CamelbackMountain Resort and Spa. Worth every penny, the food was DELICIOUS!!! The staff so helpful with the menu and spot on with recommendations, very professional. The view of the mountains just lovely, just a piece of Luxury."}
{"text":"Here is all I can say about this place:  * Phenomenal ambiance  * Top notch service * Delicious food  Everything I tried was excellent and there wasn't one thing I wouldn't order again.  I could eat a bucket of the mac n' cheese alone.  Chef Beau Macmillian stopped by our table which was awesome.  He really is a great person and excellent chef.  Also, the Edge Bar is one of my all time favorite bars and when the weather is nice I can sit out there all day and all night sipping drinks and enjoying the view.  Can't say enough great things about this place.  I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"The Elements restaurant at Sanctuary is truly a sanctuary place to be in, tucked away in a quiet resort with a great view of Camelback mountain.  Classy, elegant, and modern, it's has a romantic atmosphere and great for a date.  They even had a live band  the night we were there creating a cozy atmosphere.      The appetizer course that we shared was a duck and foie gras shumai.  Talk about fusion food: Chinese and French blend.  An odd combination, but surprisingly palatable.   The grilled foie gras on top tasted like a moist steak.  The duck confetti filling paired well with the strong flavor of the foie gras.  The teriyaki sauce added another Asian touch.   On to the main course: plancha grilled halibut and a mustard crusted Colorado rack of lamb.   The halibut was simply just ok, nothing too special.  The skin was crispy, but the fish was a bit dry.  I was wanting a citric taste from the lemon shellfish broth, but it didn't add too much flavor to the dish.   The medium rare rack of lamb store the show that night.  Tender and juicy at the same time, I found my euphoria.  The taste was strong, but not overpowering that I can still taste the tender texture of the lamb.   Definitely order medium rare to achieve this masterpiece in your mouth.  You won't regret it!  As always, another chocolate dessert for this chocoholic.  The PB bomb: I just had to order because of the creative name.  Wonderfully present, this dessert was basically a very rich and fancy Reese's peanut butter cup.   Heaven in my mouth for sure.      Another thing to look for at Elements is the bar at happy hour.  It had a relaxing atmosphere, something you wouldn't see in the trendy Scottsdale location.  The food selection isn't that wide or even that great, however the alcohol is high quality at a low price.  They had fresh ingredients and high-end liquor.  It was also fun sitting at the bar watching the bartender make my drink.    I still gave it a 5 stars even with the so-so fish, but everything else that I experienced made it wonderful in my book.  But I gotta hand it to Elements for making the place so irresistible.  This is a place for foodies to come and retreat for a relaxing evening of good food and good music."}
{"text":"We hadn't been to Elements in years, so decided to head back and check it out while we had friends in from out of town.    First off, the atmosphere is great - comfortable and cozy dining room with amazing views.  The service is top notch too - available when you needed them and not intrusive at all.    The food really steals the show though - creative menu where honestly everything sounds great! I thoroughly enjoyed my cantaloupe cocktail - so tasty!  We shared the kimchi bacon and the carrot and quinoa dumplings to start - wow, just wow!  For my entree I enjoyed the coffee rubbed duck with mushrooms and a cherry zinfandel syrup - ridiculously tasty!  The rest of our party enjoyed the swordfish and two orders of the filet...everyone was thrilled with their choices.  For dessert we shared the pumpkin cheesecake and the toasted marshmallow s'mores...everything was beautifully presented and it tasted simply amazing.    Elements will definitely be added to our regular rotation for amazing meals in the Valley!"}
{"text":"Amazing view, and excellent service. Was very happy with the Lobster Udon, and Carpaccio was to die for.  For such a fancy place, the bathrooms were terrible.  Tiny, not designed well, and on the dirty side."}
{"text":"Service is exceptional. Very pricey, but is to be expected. I only found the food to be okay. I would not venture out to eat here again. The desserts are a standout though. Other than that I was not impressed with breakfast or dinner. The Elements burger is to die for. I just expected tastier food based on the accolades."}
{"text":"I was at Elements recently for dinner. Overall experience at Elements was good. The wine list had decent options without extreme mark-ups. The view was beautiful and the atmosphere was nice. This would be a beautiful restaurant to catch the sunset. The food was delicious, although I did order a medium rare filet and it came out more medium well. If you are someone who frequently pursues fine dining, this place is not for you. Like I said, it is good, but not great. I didn't leave feeling that anything was super memorable. The staff did not seem to know that much about a fine dining experience or have much to contribute regarding wine options. I wouldn't recommend to a friend because I do think there are so many better fine dining experiences in Scottsdale/Phoenix area. I will admit I am becoming somewhat of a snob regarding fine dining. Worth trying for yourself, but don't have your expectations too high."}
{"text":"From the view to the food to the service, everything was perfect. We did dinner and watched the sunset then met friends at Jade bar next door for a few drinks. We shared the edamame and ahi tartare for apps. I had the sea bass and my boyfriend had the steak, both were awesome. The band at Jade was amazing, we will definitely return!"}
{"text":"A great setting, lovely views and brilliant service were all let down by my food. In any restaurant the food should be number 1. The only reason I am giving it 2 stars is that my wife's main course was delicious.  Started the night with a drink on the balcony, which was beautifully set and really nicely lit by gas lamps.   Moving to the dining room, I could tell that every table in the main room had a great view and the atmosphere was excellent. Very little pretentious, just friendly and helpful staff.  To start I had steamed mussels and clams to start, flavoured with lemon grass. I found the dish quite bland, with was marginally improved by the addition of a little salt. I also think the description is misleading, I ordered steamed mussels and clams but what I got was more akin to a creamy soup with mussels and clams. My wife had the foie gras and truffle mousse, it was tasty enough but was badly proportioned. The dish was accompanied with cherries and toasted bread, nowhere near enough of either to fully enjoy the sweet cherry, with the salty foie gras and the crunchy toast. One slice of the toast was badly burned on one side, forgivable normally but it was just another little mistake that threw the dish off.  For my main I ordered the duck, which was a combination of breast and confit leg. It was terrible, simply awful. The only flavour from the dish was soya sauce and the confit leg was dry,stringy and looked burnt on one side. I should have sent it back, I am upset that i didn't. My wife had butterfish with a miso crust, which as i said earlier was extremely tasty. The crust gave the fish a lovely zing. I am probably being picky at this point, but as a seafood lover I think the fish was ever so slightly over done.  For dessert we shared the goat cheesecake. It was tasty enough, nothing special though. At least I enjoyed eating it unlike my other courses.   I'll probably give the place one more chance, for lunch. Mainly to see if I had hit it on a bad night and enjoy the view during the daytime. Next time I won't be so shy about returning bad food."}
{"text":"Elements is an upscale restaurant located on the Sanctuary resort. The restaurant has an amazing view of the surrounding mountains and is great for sunset dining. There are windows surrounding the whole dining room and there is lounge space located outside on the patio and in the bar area. The design of the restaurant is clean and modern, but also classy and intimate.  We originally tried to make a same-day reservation, which wasn't an option. Instead we had to plan two days in advance and there were plenty of times available. We ate at 6 PM and the dining room was pretty empty, but it was full by the time we left. The parking is valet.   To start, we had the shishito peppers and a Fiery Mandarin cocktail. The peppers came in a huge bowl and were placed in a very unique sauce with citrus, garlic, and creamy flavors. The drink was a tasty citrus martini with a slice of jalapeño.   For entrees, we tried the Korean short ribs and maple duck. The ribs melt in your mouth and come in a sweet hoisin-like sauce with pickled vegetables and jasmine rice. The duck is cooked perfectly to be moist and tender. It comes with a striking and powerful black bean sauce and a sweet forbidden rice.   For desert, we had a cup of black current tea, which was pleasant. We also tried the PB bomb desert. It came with a nutella spread topped with a scoop of chocolate ice cream and cocoa nibs. The PB bomb itself was a crispy wafer topped with whipped peanut butter mousse encased in a thin dome of dark chocolate creme. It was incredible and easily the best peanut butter creation I have ever had.  The servers were friendly and knowledgeable. There were a few times when we waited a little longer than expected, but nothing too bad. The prices are high, but the overall value for the dining experience is great. Unlike many upscale places, they aren't afraid to provide you with plenty of food here, so you won't go hungry. The really amazing thing about Elements is how well the Asian fusion is executed. It has taken classic Asian foods and created unique dishes that you have never heard of or would find anywhere else. If you have a special occasion or the opportunity to vacation in the area, Elements is an excellent choice for unique, Asian-inspired fine dining."}
{"text":"Great ambience. Our drinks were excellent. Food was good. I'd recommend making a reservation as it was pretty busy when we were there. One of us ordered the special and then we found out after awhile later they ran out of it so that was a bummer. Waitress said they had halibut instead so my friend ordered it that but didn't think it was worth $52. Food came out kind of slow. The bread was just okay. The Brussels sprouts were just okay. All in all a good experience."}
{"text":"Literally still cannot get over how a-freaking-mazing this place is. I went here for my Grandma's 85th Birthday.  Everything about this place is 5 star!!! The service is top notch - everyone is so friendly and attentive. The atmosphere is fantastic!! It's got this zen vibe going on, with BEAUTIFUL views of the valley! And the food....my description will not be able to do it justice.   Beau McMillian is the head chef, and he won Iron Chef and beat Bobby Flay or something. His food really speaks for him!!!   We started out with drinks (I had the painkiller - basically a stronger, better piña colada) and two appetizers (the kimchi bacon and the Oysters Rockefeller). They were both small portions, but excellent!!!   For our entrees, I ordered the fois grad risotto with veal cheek. We also ordered the free range chicken, the pork chop, and the filet. All were delicious and extremely flavorful/rich. Everything was seasoned perfectly.   Dessert was the best part! My grandma had a banana miso upside down cake, and we also ordered the apple ginger tart and the \"PB Bombe.\" The upside down cake was out of this world, the tart and the ice cream with it was probably the most perfect pairing I've ever had, and the PB bomb was the richest, most delicious peanut butter and chocolate confection I've had in a loooooooong time. They topped the bombe with cracker jacks and ice cream and it was literally like tasting heaven itself.   11/10 would recommend"}
{"text":"The most amazing view and amazing service! They were so kind about helping people to take pictures of customers against the amazing backdrop. My friend and I enjoyed the most gorgeous sunset, with the most refreshing cocktail, delicious food, and fantastic service from Steven P, who was just attentive enough but also gave us just enough space to enjoy the evening. I'm always going to remember that magical evening with my beautiful friend. It was really the perfect meal :)  This is definitely a place I'm bringing my husband to when we visit Phoenix again!"}
{"text":"Talk about hidden gems in America,  this is the place.   Scottsdale has some of the best resorts in America,  and The sanctuary is the best of the best.  I would definitely recommend going prior to night time and watching the sun set.   It's an amazing view.   The drinks are great,  and I heard the food is good even though I only had the calamari.   The view at sunset deserves 5 stars alone."}
{"text":"In mid-January of this year, my wife had I had to go to Arizona for a conference, and we were looking for places that were unique and/or different -- food we couldn't get in Berkeley, or rather, foods that were \"typical\" or \"classic\" to the area.  (Why travel to Paris and order pizza?)  At first, this seemed (at least to us) a relatively simple and even obvious idea.  In reality, however . . .   So our \"fall back\" position was Elements, the restaurant within the \"Sanctuary on Camelback Mountain Resort and Spa\" -- self-described on their website as \"Celebrate the rebirth of elements, as Sanctuary introduces the evolution of a favorite restaurant into a stunning new experience of Arizona luxury dining. Discover the cutting-edge kitchen for new cuisine, new style and new decor that lives up to the spectacular setting.\"  Uh, yeah.  Well, moving past that, at least we had Executive Chef Beau MacMillan -- he of Iron Chef (he won) and the Food Network (\"Worst Chefs in America\").  How bad could it be?  Not bad at all, actually.  But on the other hand, it wasn't exactly great , either.  It's not classic American for, but rather \"modern\" American infused with Asian influences from miso to kimchee, ponzu to hijiki, and more.  The view from the dining room can be spectacular -- but we (there were four of us) were seated as far away from the oversized picture windows as possible.  (Not that big of a deal, as our reservations were long after the sun had set.)  Indeed, the interior design of the restaurant is also stunningly beautiful.  Unfortunately for the design of the room we were in, it was also exceedingly loud . . . .  We started with appetizers:  fiery calamari (fried herbs, pepperoncini, miso scallion vinaigrette) and shishito peppers (crisp garlic, sesame).  Both were very good, but not great.  We also had the ahi tuna tartare (cucumber, toasted pine nuts, green onion, sesame crostini), and fire roasted bone marrow (Korean chile glaze, shrimp toast, coriander peanut salad) -- both were delicious.  The drawback here was that we'd ordered all four at the same time, but only the first two were served . . . and when we were finished with those two, the next two arrived as a separate course.  Now, once the tartare and the bone marrow were served, we sort of figured it out:  the calamari and shishito peppers were large enough to share; the tartare and bone marrow were not.  Ergo, the waiter decided to bring out the \"shared\" appetizers first, but as this was never explained to us, we kept wondering where the rest of our appetizers were . . .   Indeed, the service was polite, even friendly, but it was also \"off\" all night long.  Things like water was brought to the table late, and only refilled if we asked.  The bottle of Champagne was served barely cool, let alone chilled.  (Wouldn't it have been better for the waiter/sommelier to explain the wine wasn't chilled, and we could either wait a while while it sat in an ice bucket OR -- sorry -- we could select another bottle?)  Unfortunately we weren't given an option, and were served a Champagne that hovered between lukewarm and barely cool -- which was definitely NOT cool.  Speaking of the wine list, overall it's rather good with reasonable prices (save the \"reserve list\"), although dominated by California wines -- mostly Napa -- with a smattering of French.  No local (Arizona) wines, which was something of a surprise as they can be surprisingly good, even excellent.  No Spanish wines, either.    Entrées included braised short ribs (truffled mac & cheese, crisp kale parsnip salad); bacon-wrapped filet of beef (caullflower, roasted shallot, asparagus, blue cheese, zinfandel syrup); maple leaf farms duck (forbidden rice, cherry-braised cabbage, fragrant black bean drizzle); and Maine lobster udon \"carbonara\" (pancetta, oyster mushroom, Thai basil, tomato jam) -- all four were delicious, but -- whether it was our own expectations that were too high, or the meal itself -- it just seemed like it was missing that certain something, that spark, that would have made the meal not only memorable, but would have made us look forward to when we could return.  Instead, it's more of a \"been there, done that, got the T-shirt\" sort of experience."}
{"text":"We just returned from vacation in Scottsdale. This was one of our favorite restaurants  It had a pretty view and dining room. Service was attentive. The sommelier helped us to select a great Italian wine ($85). The calamari and dumpling appetizers were tasty and the portions were probably large enough to share. We both had he fillet wrapped in bacon for our entrees. They were delicious...buttery and tender. The mason jar dessert was yummy and different. We highly recommend it (the bill for two with tip was $300, but it was definitely worth it!)."}
{"text":"The 2nd time I went here to take out some out of town friends and they enjoyed it with a few minor mishaps.  Didn't see as much fusion on the menu as touted but it's probably a safer bet.  Some of the highlights were the roasted beet salad, the roasted chicken, and some sort of goat cheesecake.  A good place to go for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience. Food was delightful and service exemplary.  Pork chop was the best featured item.  Chocolate peanut desert was decadent.  Will absolutely return."}
{"text":"Totally over the top amazing food and comprehensive wine list. What really makes this place the best is the service - they get the cream of the crop wait staff who pay careful attention to every detail. A stay at this resort and dining here is a little trip to heaven - no, it's not cheap but room rates in summer are a relative bargain. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Amazing service! The only thing that was better was the perfect meal and experience. You must try the strip steak. Off the charts."}
{"text":"Elements continues to be an outstanding restaurant for food, atmosphere, and service. Every dish I've tried there has been absolutely superb. My favorites include the waffles at breakfast, the hangar steak during lunch, and the calamari appetizer at dinner. They also make a terrific bloody mary. And of course, the PB bomb for dessert is sooooo yummy! The waitstaff goes above and beyond to deliver perfection. When dining for lunch during the week, ask for Jennifer--best server ever!"}
{"text":"Driving all the way up to this restaurant I was afraid of letdown like some of my other experieces with hyped up restaurants. This wasn't the case whene I went five years ago. The interior was cool and modern. The view especially at sunset was breathtaking. The food was beautiful and delicious. I especially remember my foie with sweet berries which really did it for me. The sweet balancing out salty worked well. At that time all the other Az restaurants were doing foie without sweet flavors. This pushed Elements up to another level.   I recommended this place to my brother. He took his girlfriend for brunch. They commented on how beautiful the view was during daytime. They both raved about their food saying it was the best brunch they've ever had. They've insisted I go with them the next time I visit."}
{"text":"Incredible.  The taste of each ingredient is either enhanced or well blended with the rest of the palette.  So delicious.  Everything from the cocktails, appetizers and each dish.  Delectable and thoroughly enjoyable and unique!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow ! So good. Went there for a business dinner this week. It was fantastic. Great service. Delicious food. Amazing view. Go try it !!! :)"}
{"text":"Classy, sophisticated, outstanding food, as well as plate presentation. My fiance and I had a very romantic evening with dinner prepared by chef Jason Panebianco. He made the best Chilean Sea Bass I have ever had, he's truly talented. Paired with Veuve Clicquout, couldn't have asked for more!"}
{"text":"Elements is located in the Sanctuary Camelback Mountain Resort and Spa in Paradise Valley. They serve seasonal Asian Inspired American Food. The executive chef is celebrity chef Beau Macmillan who's been on various Food Network TV Shows for many years. The dining rooms are formal but modern with picturesque views of paradise valley.  They start things going with crusty sourdough bread and butter embellished with crushed seaweed and sea salt.  My server highly recommended the Tea Brined Chicken Thighs. She said it was the best item on the menu so that's what I went with. My gosh......they really were great! The chicken was so darn tender, flavorful and very juicy. It also had this very light but crispy batter on it that was really great. My plate also contained lots of pickled watermelon that cut a lot of the richness in this dish. This dish also included other vegetables but the other special part of this dish was the sticky rice. I've had sticky rice before but not like this before. The rice was firm but chewy and also almost creamy. The rice was delicious with the different Asian Flavored sauces underneath. The sauces did run slightly sweet for my taste and I think a small amount of heat would have been great but nevertheless this was a delicious dish. I would have had two meals out of this but it was so delicious that my husband helped to finish it.  My husband had the special of the day that was a Beef Tenderloin with hoisin and five spice with cauliflower and peanuts. The beef seemed like a very good quality and was flavorful and tender like butter.  Lemon Meringue was on the menu so I had to try it. It you are a fan of Lemon Meringue you MUST get it. The meringue is just right. The filling has the right amount of sweetness and tart lemon taste. That little bit of toasted coconut adds a little to it.....The crust is a little too thick but is unique and delicious with a brown butter crust.  Our server was helpful and efficient. Other members of the staff checked on use as well.  Stunning atmosphere. Ask the server to suggest best dish to you so you will be pleased.  For Parking you must use the valet and tip."}
{"text":"fabulous!!!!!!!! amazing flavors. chef beau just rocks"}
{"text":"There isn't anything bad to say about this beautiful upscale restaurant. We got there  for happy hour and moved into the restaurant early enough to get a table with a view of Mummy Mountain and watch the sunset. Highly recommend you catch the sunset at this location!  The Jade Bar has been remodeled and is significantly bigger and better.  Anywhere you sit has breathtaking views.  For our meal we tried all 4 courses starting with an order of calamari that had an incredible sauce and sliced pepperocini peppers, which was a clever idea I'm going to steal. The calamari was clearly fresh and the best I've ever had. For the 2nd course a delicious beet salad served on top of a creamy goat cheese.  (If I could make beets like this my whole family would eat them like candy.)  The entrees we shared to make our own surf and turf....Flat iron steak with broiled vegetables and the sea bass with forbidden rice.  The sea bass was melt in your mouth perfection and the flat iron steak held it's own.  Of course we had to get the brussels sprouts to share.  They had a spicy chili sauce and pork belly to add to their deliciousness.   EVERYTHING was 5 stars!  The service was impeccable as well.  Thank you Elements!"}
{"text":"Had an outstanding lunch here.  The view is amazing, their cheese fondue dip was delicious, and they serve up a tasty burger.  I definitely recommend it and would come back in a heartbeat on my next visit to Phoenix."}
{"text":"The food was great, but we had a bad service experience. After being seated it took at least 5 minutes for our waiter to acknowledge us. Then it was another 5 minutes before he came back to take our drink orders. No one had brought us a cocktail menu even though the place is known for great cocktails, so we asked for one. That took 5 more minutes. Then it was at least 10 minutes before he came back to take the orders, then another 10 for the drinks to arrive. When the waiter came with the drinks we had to ask him not to leave because we didn't know how long it would be before he came back to take dinner orders. Apparently you can't get bread until you've ordered, because even though we asked for it, it never arrived until after we had ordered. I was about 2 minutes away from finding a manager to complain to, something I had never done. Every table around us had drinks and dinner before we had even ordered dinner.  I had met my friends in Phoenix, and they had just flown in from the east coast, so it was after midnight their time before we finally got food. Although the food was amazing they were practically falling into their plates from exhaustion.  The drinks we finally got were amazing. I had a cosmo-type thing with jalapeno muddled in. Really different and delicious. My friend had the grapfruit-basil martini which was also delicious.  I had the goat cheese/spinach salad appetizer and it was great, except a little too heavy on the dressing.  For entrees, two friends had the salmon which they loved and raved about all week. Another friend had the chicken and she was pleasantly surprised by it. I had the shrimp and pasta carbonara. I don't usually order shrimp dishes, and I loved it. The shrimp were gigantic and so flavorful. It was rich, but worth it.  We were too exhausted to consider dessert, because of the service issues.  I'm not sure our service problem was a one-off. I went back for breakfast and lunch during our stay at the Sanctuary and wasn't impressed either time. For breakfast I ordered eggs benedict with the eggs \"not too runny.\" They came literally hard boiled. I pointed this out to the waitress and she offered to take it back, but I had already waited awhile and didn't want to spend more of my vacation time waiting for food. At the end of the meal I again expressed my disappointment, but was offered no compensation, not even a comped iced tea. At lunch, the filet cobb salad was delcicious, but I had to flag down the staff for more iced tea, which was difficult since I was in a booth facing the window with no easy access to any of the staff or other diners."}
{"text":"Every aspect of our dining experience was simply wonderful.  When I made the reservation, Jessica asked if I was celebrating a special occasion.  It was my wife's birthday, so she reserved an outside table for us with spectacular views of the sunset and Camelback mountain.  When we arrived at the restaurant, Jessica was there to greet us along with Chef MacMillan!  Amazing that he took the time to come say hi.  We were escorted to our table where Jessica had rose pedals sprinkled across our table.  It was a great special touch for my wife.    For dinner we both chose the appetizer, salad, entree courses.  I had Oysters Rockefeller, Heirloom tomato salad, and beef short ribs.  They were all outstanding, especially the short ribs.  My wife has sashimi, beet salad, and pork chops.  They were all fantastic as well.  We are both wine lovers and really enjoyed talking with the Sommelier (Norbert Taillole).  He is passionate about wine and really knows his stuff.  For dessert, they brought my wife a salted caramel Panna Cotta with carmel corn on top, all served on a plate with \"Happy Birthday\" written in chocolate.    While Elements is an expensive evening, I have to say it was one of the most memorable dinners I have ever had.  The Staff was fantastic, the food was amazing, and the view is second to none.  A wonderful place for that special occasion - highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This is a great date spot!  I would recommend having drinks on the outside patio at sunset then enjoy an excellent dinner at the restaurant.   It's definitely a place where you should probably dress up a little bit, but it's not extremely formal.  The decor was very modern, dark wood, chic, with a hint of color.  I ordered the Seared jumbo sea scallops with sweet pea lobster risotto, heirloom tomato vinaigrette.   It was slightly on the saltier side, but other than that I really enjoyed the flavor and presentation.  They also give you hot and fresh bread with hummus which i believe had a slight Asian feel to it because it had some sesame oil and a hint of ginger.  Very different and interesting!   Overall, I would recommend the place if not only for the amazing view and ambiance."}
{"text":"Eh...for the price it wasnt great.  We just had cocktails.  Service was shotty at best, bartenders could have cared less, waitress seemed confused about which tables (if any) were hers, etc.  It wasnt too busy in the bar area.  We sat at a table, didnt get waited on so grabbed a drink at the bar.  No waitress ever came by so we moved to the patio.  Drinks are super expensive ($22-25 for a corona and grapefruit cosmo or some sh*t), but we know that and we were there for the view and the sunset.  Well, the bar patio kinda faces the wrong way for the sunset and the tables out there off the restaurant are reserved so we didnt get the sunset. No big deal.  We stayed for 2 drinks and the Bartender put it on my buddies card without asking us (score for me!)...We went for a special event and it wasnt very special.  I wouldnt go back unless trying to impress someone (not with the view or the service, just showing off that I like to waste money).  The chef is famous, the bartenders were lazy, the view was overrated.  They have potentially/arguably THE best spot in the valley but there are a million places in this town to go for a good experience so not sure I would risk it again...they almost seemed like they knew they would get busy later or that we were locals and they cater to guests only or something.  It seemed like they didnt need our tip $$.  We are all current or ex service industry so it was their loss.  Or maybe not, they still got their 20% on the expensive drinks so maybe thats their mindset?"}
{"text":"A long time classic favorite.....great service, views, and normally food. Unfortunately, on our last visit, the dinner did not match the menu description and was nothing I would have ordered. If the chef wants to try something new, great.....just spend the time to update the menu."}
{"text":"Beau knows the culinary arts...and service and scenery.  The Valley is littered with great resort based dining options but this is the pinnacle.  The special occasion place that is down the road but a world away.  I recommend going with several people so that you can share and more adequately explore the menu.  The foie gras benedict is decadent but in a good way, the salmon mild but filing, and the peanut butter dessert experience was akin to a kid discovering ice cream for the first time."}
{"text":"In September we went to Elements for dinner.  The service we received was not up to the standards of Elements.  For most restaurants it would have been a 5 but based on the standards Elements puts forth I would have given it only a 4.7.  On the way out I made a casual remark to the hostess that the service was not as good as usual.  She figured out who we were as we left and apparently reported to the restaurant manager.  The next day we received an unexpected call from the manager.  This was an unexpected level of service keeping mind that we did not complain and just made a passing comment.  The manager invited us back to the restaurant to have a dinner on them.  Note that we have been to the restaurant many times and that night's experience would not have kept us from returning.  Our dinner and service on Sunday were absolutely up to the standards that the restaurant maintains for food and service.  A true 5 star experience.  We had the veal chops which were cooked to perfection.  The cheese soup was not overly thick but still very rich and creamy.  Our bartender had recommended the tuna tartare as one of his favorites.  He was right on the money.  A very light appetizer which we split.  The service by all of the staff who waited on us, from the bartender in Jade to the waiter and other servers in Elements were wonderful.  Very attentive and efficient at their jobs.    I would highly recommend experiencing the atmosphere, food and service at Jade and Elements at the Sanctuary.  It is truly one of the finest experiences you will have."}
{"text":"Wanna be treated like royalty?  This is the place. If your filthy rich this is just another place, but when you can scrape up $200 to take your wife out, you go here. You may think that's alot of money but for the atmosphere,  the staff, and OMG the food....I would pay more. Plus it Chef Beau, there is no way you are getting sup par food. If anything take your lady here at least once, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Awesome  This restaurant is run by Beau McMillian.  It's a great place for an evening dinner.     I started with the Butternut soup which was by far the best I've ever had.  EVER.  The waitress recommended the short ribs, which is cooked Korean style.  She was not wrong.  Some of the best I've ever had.  The atmosphere is very intimate even though it's wide open.  The lighting was perfect and the open firepits added an ambiance.    I can highly recommend this place, but especially good if you want to impress a date, or may to propose.     Again just awesom"}
{"text":"It was my first visit to Elements along with my girlfriend to celebrate her birthday. And I should say the visit was truly memorable. We were seated at the Jade bar till our tables were set and I really enjoyed the Lichee Margarita. Perfect mix and not sweet. 5/5 for the drink My experience at the restaurant was out of the world. Our host Mr. Greg was patient explaining well each item on the menu.  For starters we had the ahi tuna tartare and I must say the tuna was very well marinated with hint of lemon and spices to the right level Moving to the entrees, I took the beef filet wrapped in bacon medium made, red at the center and my girlfriend had the scallops. Both these dishes were right up to the mark and these are must try at Elements.  Overall, I must say the visit to Elements has been truly mesmerizing for both of us. Wonderful host, mind blowing food and of course the amazing view of the mountains. So no reason why it shouldn't be 5/5.  Thank you Elements. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Love the view and good food.  Had the lobster carbonara as my meal with the king pao green beans.  They are both listed as sides, but make a surprisingly great pairing.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Attended the Table 12 Lunch & Learn event with guest Chef Mel Mecinas and was truly blown away.  I have previously eaten off of the house menu, so was expecting just as spectacular presentation as Chef Beau Macmillan presents - I was not disappointed.  Our party started the night at Jade, which I have written a review for previously.  Great place, wont go into much detail there.  The meal started with with an entree of a rare tuna, bacon, asparagus, and hollandaise sauce.  Second course was Korean short ribs, brussel spouts, and lotus root kimchi.  For dessert, twas a bourbon banana creme with carmel popcorn and candied walnuts.  The meal could not have been more amazing, and the service was just as good.  Have already booked the event on Aug 18."}
{"text":"Pricey, but lunch was absolutely fabulous.  Tempura shrimp, HUGE!  View, breathtaking.  Service, excellent.  Super place for out of town guests.  Only negative - needs a little freshening.  Carpeting, fabrics a bit worn looking."}
{"text":"This place is classy. The menu is created by an Iron Chef! It's American cuisine with Asian accents. My wife and I started off with the Shishito peppers. Great little appetizer but u get tons of them. For the two of us it was a lot. Nice clean heat. They were charred in a caramel soy glaze. My wife had the diver scallops for her entree. Fantastic dish. Their sauce was delicious. I had the pork chop over bacon brussel sprouts. Delicious!!!  Anthony was our server. Fantastic service from all that we encountered.   It's a classy joint so look clean and sharp!   Slacks and a button down would work.   I enjoyed it thoroughly and would encourage u to try this place."}
{"text":"What a beautiful setting for luxury dining and sunset watching! Just as the sun is about to set, the electronic shades lift seamlessly and very Bond-like to reveal the sun kissed mountains and orange blush sky. People who often say that Arizona is dry and barren should come here and see just how different it can be!  Memorable food items included:     Braised short ribs entree with sticky rice, brussel sprout and bacon kimichi with Korean BBQ sauce.  - This is a must order!      Duck confit mooshu chickpea crepe appetizer -unique in flavor and texture      Fiery calamari appetizer - just the right amount of spice      Lobster bisque (soup of the day) - Rich and delicious       Truffle whipped potatoes side dish - Addicting and irresistible   Summer prix fixe: (this menu changes daily and must be requested)      Rock shrimp over pork belly and Basil fried rice - really good      Chicken breast dish over mashed potatoes, but not the truffle whipped potatoes - my friend enjoyed her dish, but also just described it as \"good\"      Lava cake with vanilla gelato - Perfectly done!  Our group was celebrating a birthday, so the waitress brought out a special PB Bomb dessert on the house with the words, \"Happy birthday\" written in chocolate. They also brought out 4 yummy cookies along with our bill. We felt really spoiled by our wonderful, patient waitress (I say patient because it took us forever to decide what we wanted at first. She didn't rush us and thoroughly explained our dish choices to help us decide what to order). Thanks Elements and staff for making our friend's birthday so special and memorable!"}
{"text":"Beautifully located with valet. Loved the patio seating and view. Understaffed on a Monday, it took 60 mins for our food to come out. Food was ok. Server's assistant forgot requested condiment & waiter never ensured it arrived. Waited for condiment until food got cold. Table next door got comped dessert for the long wait (less time than us) but we didn't. Tables were being dragged around the patio by staff with utensils falling over as we ate our now cold dinner. Waiter was nice just think he prob had way too many tables"}
{"text":"The finest meal and dining experience we have ever had. From the amazing food of Chef Beau, breathtaking views and amazing service, everything was five star. We were treated like kings and queens and the food was nothing short of perfection. We have found our favorite place to dine."}
{"text":"I want to love Elements so much. Because I do love it. Parts of it. Well, one part, to be exact. The scenic view. It really is only good at sunset in one of the booths around the edges with, yes, THE VIEW. It's pretty much the only reason to come to Elements.  The interior has a very modern, contemporary feel (and decor and art to go along with it). We shared the filet mignon and a salmon dish (which was not even wild, a real turn-off for me for this caliber of restaurant), both of which were good, tasty, but, honestly, I wasn't that impressed with either dish. From the appetizer, salad, and dessert that we had, I kind of got this impression with every dish...you can't really go wrong, but don't expect to be totally blown away by the food itself either, considering how well-regarded on a whole it seems to be by the critics. I thought service was lacking, perhaps too busy and not enough/overworked staff.   If you come here with good company and orchestrate the view, you're probably set with just that. Just don't focus on the food or your server, otherwise you'll lose the mirage."}
{"text":"I had a business dinner here at it was a wonderful experience.  The hostess was very cute and friendly and brought us to a table giving us a panoramic view of the mountains and the valley.  Even though one major attraction was the sunset views, it was cloudy and we got to see distant lightning strikes instead which was pretty impressive in itself.  Our server Denise was very knowledgeable and engaging. She recommended that we try a new drink that had a mixture of rum and champagne with blackberries that was a cool purple infusion that was delicious as well.  Denise explained the concept of the restaurant in that all the produce came from farm to table and the fish and other protein were flown in fresh daily as needed.  I started out by trying the salt roasted beets (no one else in the table wanted to share with me) which were good, but not great.  The beets were just a little undercooked relatively to what I prefer/am used to and the accompanying Asian pear, sunflower seeds, and boursin just didn't add much to the dish.  Our server provided us with some edamame on the house that I did not partake in because I am not a huge fan of it.  I did fill up on the bread that they provided us.  For the entrée, I had duck which was absolutely delicious.  There were two slices of duck breast that were juicy and cooked perfectly and there was a crepe and some sweet tasty juicy tomatoes on the side as well as a rice dish.  Because my co-worker knew the chef indirectly, we were provided with free dessert which included a stout gelato, chocolate cake, and some cookies.  Price was reasonable given the high quality of service and food and drink (less than $100 per head).  Wow, I've gotta come back!"}
{"text":"Made a last minute reservation here for 5 and was able to sit outside and enjoy the view and sunset.  I can't really add much except confirm that it really is amazing.  The food was good and the service was very nice and not aloof at all.  Make sure you request Jessica as she was very nice to my young son and helped us to feel comfortable and enjoy the experience."}
{"text":"Good food, was here for a work lunch. I had the Miso Salmon Bento Box and it was delicious along with the Cucumber Salad. The prices aren't outrageous for lunches and they didn't appear to be busy so you can get in and get a table.   Views are amazing."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to visit Elements for a while now and I finally got my chance recently for my friends birthday brunch! She made a reservation  ahead of time for our group of 10 so they had no problem accommodating us. The resort is absolutely beautiful, we were seated near windows where we took in the beautiful views of the pool and the mountains. The service was great, our one server was very attentive and made sure that our champagne glasses were never empty! (huge points for that!!) The buffet had a great selection of salads, pastries and seafood, they also had a made to order omelet station as well. They also brought out plates of these yummy cinnamon rolls...OMG they were so decadent and I think they were sitting in a pool of maple syrup...I was in heaven!!   After our group finished eating we went out to their lawn area where they had live music, we were prepared and brought our blankets and just hung out danced a bit, ordered  a couple of pictures of sangria and enjoyed a beautiful Sunday afternoon. I was caught a little off guard that we had to pay $10 to enter the music on the lawn area considering we had just finished eating brunch inside of the restaurant but other than that the day was very relaxing.  I will definitely be back; I heard the drinks at the bar are amazing!"}
{"text":"no wonder this place shows up in airline magazine ads and travel and leisure ads. it is beautiful! and for being \"in the city\", it is so serene and quite! the pool, the firepits, all the cool gardens...absolutely lovely! but i still don't understand paying so much money for a hotel room.   anyway, of course we can't afford to eat here, are you kidding me? we had a foodie event that was way discounted so we were drinkin up the free mojitos and partaking in delicious appetizers. overlooking the neck and head of camelback mtn, we couldn't help but feel booojwaaa though!"}
{"text":"I went here for a birthday dinner for my boyfriend. It was great!   I made my reservation at OpenTable and included in the notes it was for a birthday. We pulled up to the valet at the restaurant and at first went directly into the lobby, instead of the restaurant. Finding the hostess on the left, not right and further down, we were promptly seated with a great view next to the windows (which were sadly covered with a curtain for the first half of dinner but the side let us sneak a peak at a beautiful wedding). The service was great. The waiter immediately wished the boyfriend a happy birthday which was a nice touch.   Things ordered: Moscow Mule: a was very refreshing and light ginger cocktail Citrus pork belly: very tender and cooked perfectly pairing wonderfully with the tart and sweet pomegranate and dried cranberries, but both of us found the mustard a little too harsh at times \"Elements feature\" Ribeye with succotash and crab: perfectly cooked but not really wowed Maple leaf farms duck: Cooked well, loved the leg and crispy skin, good forbidden black rice, neither of us cared for the bok choy  They then surprised us with the pb bomb complete with birthday candle! No complaints here. It was amazing! I loved the peanut butter mouse enveloped in chocolate with a side of ice cream (the boyfriend thought their should be more ice cream but it would have thrown off the plating).   All in all, it was a wonderful experience for a special occasion complete with sunset views, great service, and good food."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant view is beautiful  And food is delicious.. love the drinks  Great selection . Every time when we travel from  NY we always come here for lunch or dinner .."}
{"text":"This has become my go to place for bringing people from out of town. The views are spectacular and the service is wonderful. Get a reservation around sunset and you will not be disappointed. The food is consistently tasty. We have had the short rib, lobster pasta, and a duck dish most recently. All of it was generously portioned and well done. The desserts are also not to be missed. They are well plated and a beautiful end to a great meal. This isn't the cheapest spot but you do get an experience with it."}
{"text":"Stayed at The Sanctuary last week, came here for dinner for my 30th birthday celebration. The food was absolutely out of this world!!! One of the best dinners I've ever had in my life, and my boyfriend said the same about his dinner! I ordered the chicken, which was cooked to perfection with sides that perfectly complimented the dish. My boyfriend ordered the pork chop which was just unreal. We also got the BLT appetizer which was perfect. Each got a glass of wine, had an extensive menu to pick from.  When booking a reservation, they even asked if it was to celebrate any special occasions- and went above and beyond to honor that. Presentation, service, and food were all top notch. I can keep going on how much we loved it! But I will just say- go see for yourself!"}
{"text":"I have to knock this up to 5 stars and give you all a recommendation for your visit...  GET A SUNSET RESERVATION!!!  The first time I went, we had a 9:00 reservation because we made it on the same day.  This time, I called about 2.5 months in advance in an attempt to make a sunset reservation (in a booth) as a surprise for my boyfriends birthday.  It was perfect!  I couldn't have orchestrated the evening any better.  We got there at 7:30 and as soon as our celebratory cocktail hit the table, the thin blinds rose and we had an unbelievable view-it was almost too perfect!  I also made a better choice for this order and went with roasted chicken served over truffle macaroni and cheese.  It was to die for!"}
{"text":"We requested a table with a view. We were seated in the back facing each other. No view, although, I do enjoy looking at my husband. The server was attentive and good. Unfortunately, the other staff not so much. The starters came out all at once, our server requested them staggered. No communication between staff. The food was average. Shisito peppers were good, nothing unusual. Tuna tartare, I have had better at a poke shop. Oyters Rockefeller, way to salty. My special was good  the short ribs, too much stuff, kind of a mess. The sommelier poured our expensive wine into a chipped decanter and walked away.  She said, \"it happens\" Our server was visibly appalled, she pored it into a new one.  The whole bill was over  $500 dollars. It was a special occasion the cost would not be an issue if the restaurant lived up to its reputation.  Mediocre at best. Disappointing"}
{"text":"The decor and setting are excellent, as was the food.  The wine selection is incredible.  Memorable dining experience, but not for those who are watching their budget...  Have now been back several times, and never disappointed..."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant with an amazing view - 4-stars for the food, 5-stars for the view, especially at sunset to see the stunning colors against the rolling hills and then transitioning into night time with all the lights in the background - very beautiful.  I love the resort, The Sanctuary, even more!"}
{"text":"Good experience but not outstanding. Pros: 1. View 2. Ambience  3. Certain dishes are excellent   Cons: 1. Service was very good but the servers demeanor was super fake. I'm sure we all know people that throw on that super overly fake sweet demeanor? That was our server. And what's up with being called by our last names all the time? That's an attempt a high service gone horribly wrong. We are not in the military lol and don't want to be called by our last names constantly!  Summary: Oysters flown in from Maine: excellent  Escargot pot pie: very good take on escargot   Swordfish: good with lots of unique flavors on the plate  Waygu style beef: good but was served a tad on the cold side and a bit flavorless on its own but overpowered by the sauce  A lot of sauces dominated the meal and bordered on overpowering the food instead of enhancing it. Was kind of left with that heavy,  too rich greasy feeling in the stomach afterwards.   My feeling is that an iron chef rating is certainly NOT the same universe as Michelin rating and that certainly was demonstrated in the food.   Good experience but I'm being critical based on the price point of the meal and the staff's \"hype\" of the chef."}
{"text":"Everyone raves about the views at Elements on Yelp, so I had to check it out for myself.   We had dinner resos at 630 pm and as soon as I walked into the restaurant, I could see what everyone was talking about!  This is the perfect spot for dinner.    The tables all face the windows from every angle in the room.  The blinds were down until the last minute of the sunset and just like clockwork, as the sun was at the peak of the mountain...the blinds are raised across the restaurant and you start to notice, that the view has captured the entire restaurant.  Paradise Valley has never been more breathtaking and this was the perfect place to see it in all it's glory.  After the view, we decided to start with dinner after a round of cocktails and then moved onto a delicious Flowers Pinot Noir.    I have this weak spot for braised short ribs, so that was definitely my choice for dinner, they were great!  My partner had the bacon wrapped filet, which I think was the clear winner of night.  The portions were large and neither of us were able to finish our meals.    They brought the dessert menu by and we both had to pass- there wasn't anything screaming at us, so we settled on trying to finish the bottle of wine.     The service and the meal were good, but the view steals the show!"}
{"text":"Here on a girls trip and we dined at Elements 3 times and each time it was amazing!  The food was truly delicious and the drinks and wine selection were top notch!  This was the perfect place for our girls trip!  Lots of couples here too so I can imagine this place being just as perfect for couples getaway. The staff is super friendly and genuinely nice. The met our every need.   My favorite drink is \"the after fire\" essentially a strawberry jalapeño margarita. Sooo good!  Must order the charred edamame for appetizer...perfect!  PB bomber for dessert definitely! So decadent!   You will not be disappointed if you choose Elements as the views of the Camelback mountain all around are quite spectacular alongside the beautifully landscape flowering gardens and cactus!"}
{"text":"This place exceeded my expectations. My husband and I wanted to go on a romantic dinner to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We heard about Elements that had incredible  views and amazing food with an top master chef. The services was impeccable, and the food is to die for. They even provided us a dessert on the house to celebrate our anniversary. This restaurant is good for first dates, to celebrate a special occasion or if your looking to have a good time. We look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Trendy place with a spectacular view and wonderful staff, but food was trying too hard to be overly complex.   Food: 2.6, Atmosphere: 4.5, Service: 4.5  Highlights: - Location: beautiful space overlooking the mountains with gorgeous sunsets.  - Atmosphere: super trendified and modern with a fireplace towards the middle of the entry. Bar looked like a great party spot inside as well as the huge patio outside. Place settings featured a bit of east meets west with my favorite item on the table being what I called the ying and yang salt and pepper plate. - Staff: everyone from the valet to the bus boys were wonderful. Our waitress Hillary was nice and went out of her way to be accommodating to our requests. The water guy was totally on top if it too always refilling my glass which is no small feat since I drink a lot of water. The valet was cute when upon entry he told us what a wonderful night we were in store for and afterwards when discovered we were going back to watch the end of the NFL playoff game he rushed to get our car.  - Bread and dip: enjoyed the eggplant hummus with ginger and sesame along with the soft rolls spiced a bit on top - Chocolate rolled cake: my other fave bite if the night. Dense yet soft chocolate cake with a bit of crunch and style with the little circular nubbins scattered on top. Paired with caramel gelato which was jammed packed with that caramel flavor.  - Pork belly fried rice: nice touch in fat, texture, and added flavor to an already tasty rice - Check cookies: soft, chewy, and warm mini chocolate chip ones to close out the meal  Midlights: - Lower booths: love the location right by the window overlooking the view, but they were uncomfortable. The material wasn't giving so it was too stiff and width-wise it was too slim for normal sized people so we were a but crushed together when trying to eat.  Lowlights: - Seared foie: I almost never can resist ordering it when I see it on the menu, but this was not a very appetizing rendition. Biggest issue here was it way too slimy inside instead of a sear that maintained a structure throughout. The custardy mousse it was sitting on was way too huge--almost a bowl full. The addition I thought was cool individually but not sure fit in to the dish were the peppercorns and carmel rice.  - Scallops: overcooked to just at the brink of being rubbery. There was too much going on on the plate. Although visually I was impressed by the snap peas being sliced open like birds of paradise flowers, the cheese crisp was overly oily and not crisp at all and seemed out of place in the Asian infused dish.  Not sure if we just didn't order the best items and on food alone I wouldn't return, however the view and service were delightful so I might consider it..."}
{"text":"I recall the best tasting salmon of my life making such a good impression, it's the only thing I desire. Food is cooked to perfection. The views are breathtaking out there! I feel like eating here can't be topped in all of AZ."}
{"text":"**NICE VIEWS AND HIGH-QUALITY FOOD FOR A SUNDAY BRUNCH BUFFET**  3.5 stars.  I would recommend making reservations on OpenTable for view seats.  Unfortunately, we sat in the back, so our views weren't that spectacular. In addition, we were seated next to two tables of rowdy senior citizens. They can sure party.  For $34, you get the brunch. Beverages and entrees were extra.  The buffet had a good variety of foods.   From miso soups to fresh fruits and cheeses, they pleased both my inner Asian and European likes.  There was also an omelet station which was a nice addition.  GET THIS: lots of cocktail shrimp and crab legs!  We also ordered the juice of the day: apple and celery ($5 extra), but it was 80% water and 20% juice.  The food was fresh and high quality, but the overall experience was so-so.  RECOMMEND for window table dining only."}
{"text":"We ended up at Elements Friday night with my in-laws on their last night in Phoenix, as we thought it would be a nice way to end their trip. Our server was absolutely fantastic - she did a good job of answering questions, helping with selections, and making sure we had everything we needed without being in our face. Since we had a later reservation (8:45 pm), the restaurant was pretty full when we arrived, but as the night progressed, it emptied out. This time, noise was not a factor which was a relief.  My father-in-law ordered the special that evening which was similar to ahi tuna...he loved it. The rest of us ordered the scallop dish...it left us a bit underwhelmed. The scallops were on the bland side, although they were cooked pretty well. They could have used some seasoning to make them really good. Our desserts (chocolate torte and chocolate peanut butter decadence) were delicious and totally redeemed the meal in my mind. A bottle of wine, 4 entrees, and 2 desserts, set my in-laws back $230.  I still think Elements is a great place, but my husband and I were a bit let down that it wasn't as phenomenal as last year when we went for dinner."}
{"text":"This restaurant seemed okay. With a nice view. Went there for happy hour only and to listen to the band. Went with another couple who arrived after we did. Six dollar happy hour well drinks at the bar. Until the waitress talked my friends into another type of vodka. The price went from $6-$15 Per drink The bill came to $130. For four people that had a couple of drinks each. so please element staff, if people are there for happy hour please do not talk them into getting a more expensive vodka so you could pad your tips. Stay away from this place. Go to Frank and Lupe's or to the roaring fork instead"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a nice night out with friends with an absolutely PHENOMENAL view- then Elements at the Sanctuary is the place for you. We got here around 8 on a Saturday girls night. The place was packed but somehow we scored a great table at the window. The bartenders were friendly and efficient- my Manhattan was crafted expertly and if they weren't so dangerous I would have ordered a second! The vibe here is upscale and classy- and the people watching is grade A. I did not try any of the food but I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Went there for happy hour last night.    If my review was all about the views, I'd give it a 10.    Stunningly spectacular.     Otherwise, I'm giving it a four because of the server.  I'd give it a three if it was about the HH food.   I don't know if the server was sick or what.   My companion felt bad to even make her talk cause her voice sounded as though it was going.    We had a hard time getting a menu, number one.     Once she did show, it took a while to get service.   We had to keep asking the busperson (or whatever he was) for things, and he would  have to tell us he'd get our server.   She didn't bother to come back before happy hour was over, and we had to flag her down 15 minutes after it was over (She was nowhere to be found prior to that.) to order.   We definitely asked that we be given the HH pricing.    We ordered the jaded wings and the charred  edamame, and I ordered the long island.   They were so so.    Nothing spectacular.    He ordered beers.   I would go back because of the views, that's for sure.   There were a couple of musicians.   They sort of had a country feel to their music, something I'm not particularly fond of so we left, especially since we couldn't really have a conversation after they started performing."}
{"text":"I wanted to entertain an out of town guest during their stay in the Valley of the Sun and since it was Restaurant Week Elements seemed like the perfect place to make reservations. I kept the location a surprise and when we were driving up the mountain my guest was surprised that this was were we would be dining for the evening. Our reservation was for 6:30 pm and we arrived at 6:15 pm and were seated immediately on the terrace for the outside view of the sunset. We took advantage of the prix fixe menu we ordered the soup and calamari for starters, eggplant spring rolls and braise short rib ravioli for our mains and sorbet for dessert and everything was delicious! From the hostess to valet, and everyone in between made our experience a memorable one.This restaurant is a true valley gem!"}
{"text":"We were fortunate enough to attend a conference and business dinner which gave us the opportunity to try almost all of the appetizers before our entree was served.  Iron Chef, Beau came out to meet us and was gracious and amazingly talented.  The Asian Fusion tastes are imaginative and unique.  Favorite appetizer was the candied bacon with kale polenta which I considered ordering 2 of them as an entree.  Other honorable mentions are:  shishito peppers, kimchi shrimp and the Kung pao cauliflower.  My entree, Maine lobster udon in a creamy lobster sauce was the stuff dreams are made.  This meal ranks in the top 10 of all time!"}
{"text":"I was expecting greatness and was not disappointed.  My fiancee and I have been wanting to go here ever since we saw Chef Beau McMillian on The Next Iron Chef so I made reservations for her birthday.  We drove up and were greeted by the complimentary valet.  We sat at a great table that gave us an amazing view of Camelback Mountain during sunset.  The waiter was awesome and recommended the fiery calamari as an appetizer.  To my suprise, they even split the appetizer on two separate plates so we didn't have to awkwardly share one plate.  The appetizer so good that it is going to be difficult to order calamari in the future from other restaurants.  For dinner, I had the short ribs and my fiancee the pork chop.  Both dishes were great although I did prefer my short ribs.  The dish included a Korean inspired glaze, jasmine rice, and a fried egg which was a great compliment.   For dessert, they brought out a peanut butter and chocolate dish that was unbelievable."}
{"text":"I live in San Francisco, a total foodie snob city, and I must say that this place is outstanding. It's easily better than many places in SF, especially since many restaurants in SF sit on their laurels and don't really improve. I had the foie gras, which was excellent. The flavors were delightful. I would argue that it was a little too sweet; I think a more subtle sweetness would have been more appropriate. However, the course was still delicious and well prepared. I then had the tenderloin wrapped with bacon. I was going to ask them to remove the bacon initially, but then I thought to myself, \"hey, why not?\" It was a smart move. The bacon is not over-powering, and it still lets the flavor of the beef come through. The meat was cooked perfectly medium rare--almost sous vide. The flavor of the bacon was just subtle enough to make the meat more interesting, but it didn't overpower the flavor of the meat. Overall, this place is outstanding, and you can't beat the view. If you are in Scottsdale and want a special dinner, this place is excellent. It's a little pricey, just so you know. I think the foie gras was in the mid $20s and the steak was in the mid $40s, so be prepared to spend money here."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best fine dining establishments in Phoenix. Chef Beau MacMillan (Food Network chef, Iron Chef) is a master in the kitchen. The restaurant has an incredible ambiance, as it's nestled in the Camelback mountains, overlooking the Phoenix area. The windows allow for a panoramic view of the skyline. Inside it's sleek and modern with a very elegant feel. The fireplaces throughout the restaurant make it very romantic.  Both waiters were very friendly and knew the menu quite well. That had great attitudes and were very patient with us.  The bread is amazing, served with herb butter. They also brought us some edamame to start, that were well seasoned with Asian spices.  I started with the escargot pot pie. It wasn't the traditional French style, but was a very interesting take. It had mushrooms, an Asian sauce, and perfect pastry crust. It was amazing.  I had he duck for my entree. Absolutely amazing. It was cooked perfectly and seasoned very well. It wasn't greasy at all, which is a common problem with duck. The duck breast was served with a confit duck leg too.  The brussel sprouts with kimchi bacon were the best brussel sprouts I've ever had.   And for dessert, the deconstructed S'mores was impressive in both design and taste."}
{"text":"Was actually somewhat disappointed with our experience here.  My daughter and I booked spa treatments to celebrate her recent college graduation and the imminent start of her first job, and showed up a bit  early so we could have lunch and enjoy the facilities.   The setting is absolutely beautiful - Camelback Mountain is RIGHT THERE - but I thought the resort itself was a bit underwhelming... particularly the pool and spa area.    We ended up having lunch at the restaurant Elements.  Great table with a wonderful view, attentive service, but the food was a complete disappointment.  We started with charred edamame - something we usually love, but it had the most unpleasant-tasting marinade/sauce over it.  Not sure if it was vinegar- or citrus-based, but it did not taste good.  I also ordered the lobster bisque and, although it had a seafood taste to it, I couldn't find a single piece of lobster in it.   They make a presentation of delivering the bowl with an assortment of minced items in it, to which they then ladle the cream over.   Perhaps it was just because it was minced so small, but I couldn't find a single piece that had the texture and taste of lobster.  Given we were there for a special occasion and wanted to keep the mood happy and upbeat, we didn't voice our complaints to the waitress, although I was somewhat surprised she didn't notice/ask why we only ate a few of the edamame.    For our main course we had the grilled cheese sandwich and the omelet - both were just okay, nothing I would go back for or order again.   Same could be said of our spa experience.... okay, but nothing special.  Given the number of top-notch resorts/spas in the area, there was nothing about our experience here that would inspire us to come back.    Disappointing, because although it was our first visit here, we had the impression the resort was one of the premier ones in the valley.    Our experience didn't bear that out."}
{"text":"One of the best things about this place aside from the food is the beautiful scenic views and the atmosphere of the restaurant. They provide one of the better settings for dining out and you won't come across too many places that offer this.  The food was very good, they offer many gourmet dishes that you wouldn't always make at home. They do put a lot of effort into their dishes and as you can tell by the photos they are successful in making some memorable dishes. We tried a few items from apps to dessert and was very impressed, they do an excellent job here and I would go back again to try more of their offerings.  If you're looking for a special occasion restaurant this would be a great choice. They are doing some great things here."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Elements two weeks ago for date night. It was our second time, our first visit being over 3 years ago. We couldn't get a table then and ate at the bar, food was pretty good.  I made reservations, excited to have an adult night at such a beautiful setting.  We got there and the restaurant was 1/3 full.  The good-  Like I said, beautiful setting, nice and romantic. I had two drinks (while ridiculously expensive) they were very good. We had a great time talking and enjoying each other company. Mind you, we moved here from NYC so I know expensive drinks but $15.00? And I'm no lush but I didn't found them to be bigger than drinks at other bars.  The bad- Well, unfortunately everything else. Our waitress was nice but forgetful and absent minded. She offered to split our salad and didn't and forgot about our truffle mac & cheese order until we reminded her. The food- I was so heartbroken b/c we really enjoyed dining out and fine dining and it was such a let down. Our appetizers were average. My husband had the spinach casserole and I had the crab cake , which was the size of a half dollar. We then shared a salad which was OK but I think it's hard to mess up salad. And our entrees..... I had the monk fish wellington. The monk fish was luke warm and very bland and the vegetables too salty. My husband had the short ribs and again, bland.  We both love mac & cheese so we decided to wait for it. Our waitress came twice to tell us they were making it. When it came it was super hot but....it was crunchy!!! Some of it was al dente but mostly it was uncooked.   I was still waiting for something to be: wow, this is delicious so silly me ordered dessert, salt caramel panna cotta. Once again, disappointed. It was merely ok.  At least they didn't charged us the mac & cheese.   We decided not to complaint. My husband asked me if the food ruined my evening and thankfully it didn't, so we decided to just let it go. But let me tell you, that was one expensive \"let it go\".  Maybe it was just a night off, which worries me a bit considering that the restaurant was practically empty."}
{"text":"The best view in Phoenix!  Highly recommend for romantic evening or bringing visitors of the valley to take in a perfect sunset. Food and menu is incredible and very good wine list."}
{"text":"Oh man...A+...Boyfriend took me here for dinner to celebrate our anniversary and it couldn't have been more perfect. We are vegan, and they even had a wonderful tofu dish on the menu...Everything we ordered was amazing and delicious. Service was outstanding and I would highly recommend this place for a special occasion or weekend cocktails. :)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I frequent this place several times a year for various reasons because we absolutely love everything about this place, from its location to the experience. Elements is located within the Sanctuary, which rests at a slightly raised elevation, providing a beautiful view of Paradise Valley. Particularly at sunset, the views are breath-taking. The property itself is also very nice and kept. They self-parking as well as valet.  I do recommend a reservation on busier nights, such as weekends, since there can be a wait. The service here is usually excellent. The servers are very friend, professional, attentive, knowledgeable. They explain all the dishes, and the kitchen does a great job with its presentation. The food itself is delectable. Sometimes they serve a chicken that will melt in your mouth. When they don't have this chicken, they offer other equally delicious options. My boyfriend and I always get the shishito peppers. I have no idea what they do to these peppers, but their preparation of this food continues to be the best, despite having tried multiple other shishito peppers dishes at numerous other restaurants. They do serve alcoholic beverages (I am a fan of their cocktails) in the restaurant, and they do have a bar/lounge area attached to the restaurant itself. The ambiance is extremely classy and clean. They have these enormous windows which provide a direct view into the scenery I describe above. They also have glass votives with candles, dim lighting, that creates a romantic environment.  It is on the pricey end, but definitely worth it if you have money to spare."}
{"text":"I love the whole property that Is the sanctuary on camelback.  We were looking for a restaurant with a view and were not disappointed.   Our server was dry and funny and honest.  I appreciated his candor. The other wait staff was also incredibly attentive. The cocktails/wine/most of the food, ranked very high. The ceviche and tofu app. Along w the pork chop were amazing.   As far as the food went, I only had two complaints. The bread they served was pretty awful, super hard and inedible. The second, and I feel bad for saying it, was the lobster carbonara. This dish sounded like a wild wonderful dream and the portion was more than generous. My problem was that the lobster literally tasted like nothing. Perhaps my taste buds are on the slow side, but I was so sad. The pasta was incredible, but alas, the lobster just made me sad:( I guess I ordered wrong:( I also called ahead and let them know it was our wedding  anniversary, yet they never acknowledged it or comp'ed our dessert. That sounds cheap except everyone gets that at the restaurant. Just took away a bit of a \"sweet surprise\" for my husband."}
{"text":"Celebrity chef restaurant?  Sounds overrated, but it's not.  The view is amazing, the ambiance is relaxed.  Service is friendly but not as top notch as you would expect.  The food is great.  It's a high end gastro pub asian fusion mash.  My kind of stuff.  Even the sides were great."}
{"text":"Marcus seemed to cover pretty much everything in his review of Elements and their recent transformation...  I'd just like to say \"ditto\" to everything he said since I was finally blessed with the opportunity to experience a meal at this Valley gem... and in case you were wondering, it was worth the long wait!  A few things that Marcus did not mention: - the (complimentary) buddha bread and eggplant dip; a nice little starter to whet our appetites - the side order of shishito peppers that we ordered as a starter - delicious with just the right amount of kick - the pork belly fried rice (I didn't have any but Jared loved it!) - the sautéed mushrooms (why don't my sautéed mushrooms come out this good?)  And just to go into a bit more detail: I ordered the Arctic Char entrée and J went with the Duck Breast... both were prepared perfectly.  Elements touts itself as serving \"farm-fresh American cuisine with Asian accents, including sustainable seafood and the best local produce.\"  I love the Asian accents and everything we at was extremely high quality... the attentive service from Mark and staff included.  We agreed on one dessert for the table; we told Mark to surprise us between the cracker jack soup and the bamboo torte... and bamboo torte it was.    I floated home after my experience at Elements... fine wine, exquisite food, attentive service, beautiful views, awesome ambiance, and incredible company - what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"The first time we ate here, we went with a friend of executive chef Beau MacMillan and got special treatment.  We were served four different dishes of the most exquisitely prepared fish I'd ever eaten, followed by desserts that were to die for.   The next time we ate at sunset, and the views of Paradise Valley as the sun is setting are stunning.  The prices are comparable to other high-end restaurants, but the view and atmosphere here can't be beat.  They can accommodate a gluten free diet, too.  Always a bonus when my family comes to town.  The food is always fresh and flavorful and Beau Mac is an engaging and entertaining chef to talk with.  I always have fun at Elements, and look forward to going again for the next special occasion or family visit."}
{"text":"If you're In Scottsdale, this place is great for a nice sunset dinner! The views are breathtaking!!! The service was great too! I had the Chilean Seabass. It was good but not worth $54. The lemon meringue was super good if you like citrus flavor!"}
{"text":"The free valet parking, the service, and view is just the beginning. The food is very creative, fresh, and prepared to perfection. The bread was not great and the butter was hard and cold. A great place for a special night out."}
{"text":".... when visiting the valley of the sun I make it a treat to head over to elements for some delish dinner with friends.  aside from the yummie drinks, view and at one time... a Britney & K-Fed sighting... (hence one star less) I love this place."}
{"text":"What an experience! We love great food, we love amazing locations and experiences; this checked all the boxes 600%! Food was amazing: bison carpaccio and pork chops for me, grapefruit salad and salmon for my wife. Both entrees recommended by our our waiter Greg, and both fantastic recommendations! This was an amazing experience; great table, great food and great service (Greg). We will be back!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in the Scottsdale area. The ambiance is wonderful especially if you dine outside at sunset overlooking the pool with a spectacular view of the Camelback mountain range. The food is exquisite with exceptional flavor combinations and some unique ingredients. For instance I had the halibut special with two sauces, blood orange segments, fresh peas, forbidden rice and tempera battered squash blossoms stuffed with crab. It was a culinary delight!  We also enjoyed the heirloom tomato salad and the spicy edamame. Perfect dining experience for a special occasion"}
{"text":"Allow me to start out by saying I never thought I would be the type of person to write an email regarding a dining experience (good or bad).       Having said that, the only positive thing I can say about our evening at your restaurant was that the valet guy was very pleasant and friendly. It was a special evening for my girlfriends birthday (I called ahead and pre-ordered flowers for the table). Our drinks took way longer than they should have, the main courses and side dishes were average, the time between clearing our plates and dropping off dessert menu's was at least 15 minutes, and the birthday dessert was far from impressive. I would most certainly have informed a manager but didn't have the opportunity since there was no table check during our meal (isn't this standard at fine dining?). Not to mention I would love to inform you of our incredibly boring server's name but I have no idea what it was since he never introduced himself! I hate to sound so crude but with that beautiful location and relatively pricey per person check average, we expected a little more.  Perhaps a little less time filming shows for the Food Network and a little more time focusing on the little things that create a memorable experience is in order? Just a thought."}
{"text":"I had expected a lot from this restaurant.  The resort is top notch and I had seen Beau MacMillian on the Food Network and was a fan.  I came with four friends and cowokers tonight to sample Elements.  The calimari was absolutely delicious.  The pork belly smaller dish was quite tasty as well.  I had asked the waiter for advice regarding the size of the smaller dishes and had been advised that were all of the size to share so I was disapointed when we had ordered the pork and shrimp dumplings and it turned out that only two potsticker shaped dumplings arrived for our group of five and they were quite chewy and no one cared for them.  The tuna tartare at $19 was okay but not very flavorful.  I had ordered the scallops entree which at $38 was quite disappointing.  One of the scallops was not seared at all and the sauce was icky.    I ate less than half the entree but the servers did not seem to notice this.  The string beans had a delicious sauce but me and my tablemates agreed that the texture left a lot to be desired so most was left uneaten.    This is the first time that I have spent over $100 on a dinner for one and have left disappointed, Santuary at Camel Back is a beautiful resort but I feel like there is some fine tuning to be done to its restaurant to justify its hype and cost."}
{"text":"I used to visit Sanctuary quite often back in the day.  Whether it was just for a day or a weekend getaway, I've always enjoyed the gorgeous views, amenities and atmosphere.  Nowadays, I just come here for dinner or brunch from time to time.  I recently tried the calamari and swordfish paired with blanc de blancs which was a great choice, it all tasted delicious.  It's always a pleasant experience here because the service is outstanding."}
{"text":"Yes, this place is beautiful but I was underwhelmed.  The food was not as good as I expected, my husband said his day boat fish was too thin and overdone. This is not to be expected at a top notch restaurant.  I felt our server was not very attentive, the view of course is lovely, but the restaurant was way too warm and once the music started in the bar, it was hard to have a conversation in the restaurant.  Maybe we just hit it on a bad night, but it doesn't get rave reviews from me at all."}
{"text":"Celebrated my birthday here with friends.  And what better place.  Never had a bad meal here.  One of my fav restaurants in town! Need I say more?"}
{"text":"The food,  the view and the service is fantastic!   I recommend the pork eggs Benedict with a cheddar cheese biscuit.   It's a whole lot of goodness."}
{"text":"In a word, pathetic.   I can only comment on the brunch they presented on Sunday.  Took a relative visiting from New England that wanted to eat at a Beau MacMilan restaurant and boy was it disappointing. Here's the low lights:  1. Menu. You can pay a lot of money for the brunch or a lot more money on top of brunch to have an entre. No option available just to order an entre. Already strange.   2. Selection. Seems like whatever was left in the kitchen over the weekend turns into brunch. Maybe Kitchen Confidential  was right. Rice and miso soup in the left corner with a small bowl of hummus (no pita) in the right corner. Omelettes on the west side, Greek orzo on the east side.  If you are suffering from an identity crisis, you may as well serve up some classics (roast beef or ham with eggs) and take the hit that you are boring.   3. Service. Abysmal. Our smarmy French server Daniel had an excuse for everything that he failed to deliver. After 10 minutes of waiting for soy sauce for the white rice I walked into the kitchen myself and within 20 seconds came back with soy sauce. Just a thought but when you take a plate with utensils it would be wise to replace them.  I can steal them from the next table over myself (which is what he did). Unlimited sparkling wine comes with the buffet, if you could get a refill. Eventually we tasked one of   the more helpful bussing staff to fill in where the server failed, which was at nearly every task and its a buffet !   4. Management. At one time, the  manager made a stroll through the dining hall but never stopped at a single table to ask how things are going,  Probably because he already knew. His major accomplishment was getting more Coronas from downstairs.   5. Bill. Kids under 7 eat free until the bill shows up. Now I've got to go track down the non existent server to dispute the bill.  In the end, someone spent millions of dollars to build a beautiful restaurant on the side of Camelback Mountain, only to fill it with unqualified staff to create sour memories for eager out of towers, but at least it's expensive.   Highlights, the table bussing staff and valet. Both very nice and hard working."}
{"text":"Definitely a 5 star restaurant for fine dining. We had the calamari, ribs, and pork dish. They were all amazing. Service was great and the view was pleasant. It is a higher price joint but well worth it! Great alcoholic beverages as well!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot! Stayed at the resort and rolled out of bed to a delicious high end breakfast. Dee lish us!"}
{"text":"I eaten here several times and each time it is a wonderful delicious experience. The culinary experience at this restaurant is unbelievable! The views being that you are on the camelback mountain are spectacular too."}
{"text":"This was a disappointment. The food was nothing special. It was salty and heavy.  We were a party of four and we all felt Ill the next day. Great setting for drinks. I would not eat there again, I'm not that picky.  I actually makes me sad to leave this review. The state of restaurants in Phoenix is pathetic."}
{"text":"Wow! What a lovely location. Very impressed with service and excellent food. My guest and I had the grilled chicken and potatoe leek soup and it was delicious. The walk to the restaurant from the parking lot smelled amazing, flowers everwhere. I will definatly go back. Would be an amazing date dinner!"}
{"text":"The wife and I went here for lunch today and loved it. My wife had the sesame crusted tofu which she said was amazing, the tofu was large and delightful along with the rice/sauce. I had the chicken sandwich as I can't help myself always trying a new chicken sandwich. That baby was full of flavor and amazing. Sauce, peppers, and cheese gave it wonderful touch. The view was splendid. Defiantly worth coming to again especially when we stay there next time."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous.  For the record, the view is really nice and worth seeing, but the food is atrocious.  It's not that the ideas for a particular dish aren't interesting, it's that the meats, cuts, and vegetables are flavorless and/or terrible.  For a $35 salmon dish, the salmon dish was farmed!  Farmed salmon at a restaurant like this!  What are they trying to pass off on us?!?  Moreover, the wine list was terrible.    So the view may be good but if I remember correctly, you go to restaurants for food.  But, apparently the restaurateurs who conceived the elements don't subscribe to this philosophy."}
{"text":"Food was excellent....keep reading though. The view was also nice. The view at A Different Pointe of view is a little nicer though. The cocktails were out of this world. Hand crafted with unique ingredients. I had the cucumber honeydew cocktail and it was amazing. I thought the food was very good, but for the price point,  we have had better. We are from Miami, so definitely not strangers to pricey meals....but overall, I would recommend."}
{"text":"Drake would approve of this place.   Why?   Because he could enjoy his wine spritzers here in peace.   Drake also probably already knows that this is *the* place to go while in Phoenix.  I (unlike Drake in my imagination) am neither from \"The 6\" nor has I ever heard of Elements prior to dining there last week. However, upon returning home to DC, at least three people have either told me about their favorite restaurant in Phoenix (Elements) or have asked me if I had a chance to check it out during my visit.   Lucky for me, I was able to check the box off on this impressive experience.   The views here are top notch and quite honestly, could stand alone for me. Even if the food was mediocre, I would have still enjoyed a glass of wine and found the sunset views of the mountains, overlooking a beautiful infinity pool, breathtaking.  However, the food is not mediocre. In fact, it's fantastic (and so is the service.) My coworker and I ordered the Miso Salmon to split, and I was impressive by the portion size. Even split, it felt like a satisfying, full meal especially accompanied by the rock fish sticky rice. (Which was creamy, flavorful and so, so good!)  So yes, it's definitely worth the visit for a peaceful retreat, a glorious view and maybe, a wine spritzer."}
{"text":"Beautiful views of valley.  Food very good. We enjoyed the edamame ( huge portion), beet salad, short ribs and duck.  All done well. Service was great."}
{"text":"Beau MacMillan is the executive chef here. What a talented chef. We've been there a few times. The first time we were there he had a special lobster bisque like soup with a breaded scallop at the bottom.... It was amazing. My wife swears by the lamb.   It;s really awesome. The chicken is just chicken... but so far everything else has been delicious."}
{"text":"It has been a while since we've dined at Elements, so we decided to drop in for dinner last week.  It was 6:30 pm on a Thursday and we were able to get seated immediately with no reservation.  After browsing the menu, we decided to order:  Bottle of 2011 Edge Cabernet, $50 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/elements-paradise-valley?select=H0EVCkIUGi99mUMFWJhn-g#H0EVCkIUGi99mUMFWJhn-g  Iced Shellfish Platter, $36 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/elements-paradise-valley?select=hNpp4h_HpdQQeEItypxVsw#hNpp4h_HpdQQeEItypxVsw http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/elements-paradise-valley?select=7A1cAyB1n_CGFibC94nO5Q#7A1cAyB1n_CGFibC94nO5Q  Wedge Salad, $14 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/elements-paradise-valley?select=ZLZ80iAimkaw6DvsKzP-3g#ZLZ80iAimkaw6DvsKzP-3g  Pepper Encrusted Filet, $44 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/elements-paradise-valley?select=gyhoMxTOhxyW0rpzv4tlAg#gyhoMxTOhxyW0rpzv4tlAg  Hudson Valley Foie Gras, $24 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/elements-paradise-valley?select=VBVpkMDbAofUXa9PBU5Cfw#VBVpkMDbAofUXa9PBU5Cfw  Irish car bomb, $11 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/elements-paradise-valley?select=BTMQF5GK_IDSaphESOST8Q#BTMQF5GK_IDSaphESOST8Q  S'mores $11 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/elements-paradise-valley?select=BIkjxuFzsIJUT4_TMQikkw#BIkjxuFzsIJUT4_TMQikkw  Ladgate 20 yr Tawny Port, $14  For starters, the Better Half had the Shellfish Platter and was very pleased with it.  It's not as large of a portion as it sounds, but it can be shared between 2 or 3 people.  I had the Wedge Salad, which was too sweet and \"soggy\" for my tastes.  As you can see in my photo, the Salad had dressing on the bottom of the Salad and was also topped with Pickled Onion, Tomato, and Avocado....it was missing that \"crisp crunch\" that I love about Wedges.  I won't order it again.  For the main course, TBH had the Foie Gras, which she devoured....she loved it.  I had the Pepper Encrusted Filet which was also awesome and cooked perfectly just a shade above Medium.  The Filet was full of flavor and the portion was just right.  To compliment our entree's we had a bottle of 2011 Edge Cabernet, which hit the spot.  For dessert, we had the Irish Car Bomb and the S'mores....the Irish Car Bomb was awesome.  The S'mores was good too, but very rich and we couldn't finish it.  They have a nice selection of after dinner drinks, so I had a glass of Ladgate 20 yr Tawny Port to go with dessert.  The wait staff is very attentive here and gave us impeccable service throughout dinner.  That's one of the reasons why we love this place.  Return Factor - 100%"}
{"text":"Like everyone else, I have to give the view major props. If driving west towards the restaurant, you get an amazing view of Camelback Mountain. Once you get to the restaurant, the view overlooking the mountain is gorgeous. The cocktails are delicious and the food is quite tasty. Not the most amazing food I've had but it's good and the ambiance adds to the experience.   The pork tempura appetizer was probably my favourite but we also had the tuna tartare and the goat cheese with spinach fondue. For my main course I had the cod which was cooked so perfectly. Overcooked fish is pretty gross and this was cooked till it was so tender.   The service was good, again not the best I've had but was very high. If you're going to try to impress, this would be a good place for a special date. :)"}
{"text":"My husband took me here for my birthday and it was wonderful! We both LOVED the food and the lower booths were private and overlooked the mountain views. The glass was a bit difficult to see through at times however it was still beautiful. The service was great, had no issues and he recommended a special they had with Quail for my hubby to get as an appetizer and he loved it.  They brought out a free desert for my birthday with a candle lit. it was great! would definitely love to come back. We even bought my parents a gift card for Christmas to go there for dinner."}
{"text":"I went here for Christmas dinner with my family this year. Wow! This was the best dining experience of the year for me. Everything was perfect!  The details... Christmas dinner is a four course menu for $90 excluding drinks. There were several options to choose from for each course.   For my first course, I chose the crab stack. Several of my family members chose the gnocchi and another chose the beef carpaccio. Whatever you chose, it was big enough to be an entree.   For the second course, there was a choice of two salads and a lobster bisque. Everyone in my party chose the beet salad. It was very good and also huge! We were told that the lobster bisque was the most popular choice of the evening and from what I could see, it looked amazing. I guess we are salad people in my family!  For the main event, the choices were rack of lamb, steak, sea bass, duck, vegetable wellington and I believe one other. I chose the duck! It was served as a sliced breast and one leg. Absolutely perfect!  The lamb, steak and vegetable entrees were selected by family members. Everyone said their choices were fantastic!   We were all stuffed, but had to try the included dessert. I chose the peppermint cheesecake. It was good, but a little heavy on the peppermint. My other family members tried one other desserts and enjoyed them.   All of the courses were huge. Elements did not skimp whatsoever on any of the courses which is what normally happens with a set menu.  This was worth every penny!   I also want to add that we were not rushed by our server. All courses were perfectly paced which made for a very nice evening.   Another nice thing about Elements is the very beautiful view of Paradise Valley from the restaurant.   I can't wait to go back to try their regular menu!   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great views and a unique dining experience. Private seating on the inside window row overlooking to pool and valley is a must.  Margaritas were good and went down easy. The food with an Asian flair was high quality and and delicious. Large portions that make you want to over eat because it is so well done."}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast and ordered the eggs benedict and pancakes. The poached eggs were cooked to perfection and the pancakes were first rate. The view ain't bad either."}
{"text":"Starting with the valet the service here is impeccable. Once in the restaurant it has nice decor with heat lamps using flames all around the restaurant. We were seated facing the city with a mountain view. The walls in front of us were slid open so we were essentially outside. Amazing and romantic setting.   For appetizers, my wife had the fire roasted oysters.  Has to be some of the best oysters we've ever had!  Crusty on the top but juicy underneath.  I had the citrus cured pork belly with currants. Very nice and tasty although I would have preferred the outside of the pork be more crusty with the inside moist. It was still very good.   For entrees we had the scallops with lobster dumplings and the Kubota pork chop with 5 spice and hoison sauce.  Both dishes were amazing although the pork chop was the best. We were a little disappointed that the scallop entree came with TWO scallops. For that price we'd expected more but they were tasty. We also had the glazed carrots which were spectacular.  A good selection of wine rounded out the dinner.   For dessert we had the PB bomb. Incredible. And it was sized perfect to share after the meal.   If you haven't been there it's worth the visit for a romantic dinner."}
{"text":"If my review were solely based on the food, I would have only given them 2 stars.  However, the maitre d' offered to makes amends by discounting our bill.  Everything we have was terribly salty and we mentioned this the waitress who in turn mentioned it to him.    It was my birthday and we had been looking forward to trying Elements for quite awhile.  We started with the crab and spinach hot pot.  It was good, but not great.  The dish had a soy sauce finish that lingered on our palates.  It wasn't bad, it just seemed rather unsophisticated.  I had the special .... a pan seared rib eye with lobster risotto and my husband had the duck.  The duck breast also was served with a leg portion that so dry , it was inedible.  Besides both dishes being way too salty, they were very uninspiring for a high end gourmet restaurant.   We expected to be \"wowed\" and the food did not aspire to anything close. The highlight of the meal was the complementary dessert .... a chocolate and peanut butter concoction that was very good.  In addition to the food being a disappointment, the service was less than stellar.  It took an hour from the time we order until our entrees arrived.  We received our appetizers in a timely manner and then were served the sorbet.  After that, it was at least 20 mins. before the main courses arrived.  Our water glasses were never refilled (and we really needed them to be) and the entire service was rather aloof.  I think we saw our waitress a total of 4 times after we were seated .... when she brought us our drinks and take our order, to ask if we needed our drinks refilled, to serve the dessert and bring us the bill.    We will give Elements one more try, but there may be too many short comings for them to overcome.  If you read some of the other reviews here, they aren't getting 4-5 stars because of the food.  Most people are giving them extra stars because of the views and ambiance."}
{"text":"My boss took me to Elements for a birthday lunch. The views were so pretty, and the food was really good. It was definitely a special place to celebrate. We brought 2 children with us and they were very happy with the children's menu as well. :)"}
{"text":"We have been going to Elements for awhile now to enjoy the views and the food in the lounge. The service is always great as well.   Last night we stopped by for a couple of cocktails and some snacks. So at 5:00 p.m. on Friday we learn there is no longer Friday happy hour. OK. We order a 15.00 Korean Chicken Quesadilla and a 15.00 Kale Caesar salad.  The \"cheese (sparse chicken present) quesadilla\" was basically what you would get at any Mexican restaurant but without guacamole, sour cream, and salsa (Elements quesadilla came served with a single green onion and a little squirt of some Korean style sauce inside). And when I say \"little\" I mean tiny amount. So basically we were served two tortillas with lots of melted cheese and two or three very tiny cubed pieces of chicken.   The salad serves was your basic simple Caesar with lettuce, kale, and drenched with too much dressing . A piece of aged Parmesan adorned the top.   For 3 drinks and two snacks our bill comes to 75.00. We are accustomed to Scottsdale and Paradise Valley pricing but we have found in this area that the price usually justifies the fine food that is served. Although I haven't tried the dining room the bar food has always been good in the past at Elements. I would definitely recommend though that they step it up on at least these two menu items mentioned here."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go if you are with a date. Very romantic and beautiful scenic environment. The service is superb and the food is great! I've had breakfast, lunch and dinner here and highly recommend all three times to dive here. I sat outside every time. The view of the mountains behind the infinity pool is so beautiful!"}
{"text":"The oysters Rockefeller here are the best cuisine I've had INSIDE the United States. So excluding Europe, this is the best thing I've ever had"}
{"text":"I LOVE a great fine dining experience, and Elements is such a great place to treat yo'self! (I actually went back in April but stumbling across some old photos of the sunset/food, I was suddenly compelled to write about how amazing this place is!)  Drinks:  -Some grapefruit cocktail caught my eye immediately, and it was perfectly refreshing and not too sweet.  Starters: -Escargot Pot Pie: SO delicious. I cannot say enough about this ugh. -Roasted Oyster Rockefeller: I really liked the incorporation of Chinese sausage. It was such a unique way of incorporating Elements's Asian inspiration! Reading it on the menu, I have to say I was kind of confused (being Chinese), but the flavors went together very well! If you're trying to get the best bang for your buck, maybe not the best choice dish. But if you are treating yourself, try this out!  Main entrees: -Kurobuta Pork Chop: Love the pork with the 5 spice seasoning, and love the brussel sprouts/bacon in this! Plus the pork was so tender and just melted away in my mouth! -Miso Glazed Salmon: Flavors in this were seriously spectacular. I always wonder how salmon can be done uniquely and if it's worth the money or not, and this salmon proved it can and is indeed! -Coffee Rubbed Maple Leaf Farms Duck: THIS was a stunner. Presentation was definitely 5/5 for this with all the colors. Flavor combinations were also unique and relatively uncommon, so I'm glad my whole party agreed to try this!  Dessert: -Banana Miso Upside Down Cake: For the people who don't love super sweet desserts, this cake is your friend. The bacon brittle was just crunchy to perfection, and paired with peanut gelato? I swear my mouth is watering looking at my photos now.  On top of quality food, the view is stunning! I cannot wait for another occasion to come here!"}
{"text":"I must preface that my rating has nothing to do with the food. The food was awesome with fantastic presentation. The foie gras and dumplings were delectable. I have had better fish but it was still on par with most of the places I've visited lately. The pork chop, however, was orgasmic! And they served the best dessert I've had since I started on yelp.  The reason I've rated it four stars is because of the service. Now, the service wasn't awful, but it wasn't great. Have you ever been to a place and just feel the complacency of the employees? That's the feeling I got from the service. Our server declined to clear dishes and always waited for a buster to come around. The host didn't pull out our chairs, which I wouldn't expect from most places, but from a resort and that kind of money being spent, it's something that I've become accustomed to. But the number one thing that really made the score drop was that the valet counted his tip in front of us. Again, the food was amazing. I just think the service can be better."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT food.  Nice views.  Painfully slow service.  The restaurant is also dated.  With the new Ritz coming and other resorts (Phoenician) getting upgrades they might consider stepping up their game."}
{"text":"We were lucky to get a house - Gallery - for our stay at a discounted price. It had four bedrooms an amazing pool, a garage and excellent ammenities. The bath products are great here as well. Each room has a flatscreen tv as well as the living room. The resort is a little spread out so you can call a golf cart for pickup or walk but in the heat we opted to shuttle a lot. They are amazing about it though. The service overall is top notch. The gym is excellent with great new equipment. The restaurant is ok - I had a solid egg Benedict for breakfast. We saw a few desert cockroaches in our rooms which sucked and avoided getting a five on the place but the staff apologized and gave us free champaigne to make up. I also got an amazing massage here . Would recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is slick. The expanse of windows provide the best views of Paradise Valley out into Scottsdale that I've seen without strapping on hiking boots.   The food was very good, but the service was outstanding. This is the ultimate \"impress someone from out of town\" spot and doubles as a \"I am very successful but private about it\" location.   For all the glitz and glam, it really isn't all that expensive. I had a sandwich that was nine or ten bucks and it was filling and came with a side.   You just can't ask for much more than that."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money here. Had a \"very special\", $360 Christmas Dinner here where we were sat outside, ignored, served subpar food, and when staff finally did visit our table and clear plates, they were just dumped on the table next to us so we could stare at them the rest of the night. Worst special occasion restaurant of my life. Don't make the same mistake my husband and I did."}
{"text":"My wife and I were exploring this area last month and Elements was recommended as one of the better Sunday Brunches in the area. To begin with, the view overlooking Paradise Valley is gorgeous and makes for a delightful ambiance. The service was very good as well. The menu selection was solid with several interesting choices but when they actually came out... they were very good. But not outstanding. The preparation was fine and the presentation was excellent. The flavors were just ordinary. In an age where we have access to and it's considered acceptable to use an amazing variety of spices and herbs, the dishes we had were more or less what you could have gotten a hundred years ago (well, plus some avocado). They were very well done by these standards, but there just wasn't much creativity going on. I'd call them vanilla, but I don't think they used any of that either. It's still a very good place and there is a lot to recommend about it, but it's still a few flavors short of five stars - at least for Sunday Brunch (we didn't have a chance to try dinner)."}
{"text":"nestled on the North side of Camelback Mountain, this restaurant is part of a resort called Sanctuary. The resort is simply beautiful, with lots of casitas of varying degrees of lavishness for your stay. Their spa is fantastic.  But this is about the restaurant.... Food Network star Beau McMillion (sp?) is the executive chef, and from time to time, you'll hear a loud boisterous voice and you turn around and there he is.   This is a beautiful restaurant, with an amazing view famous for sunset dining. Make reservations because this place can fill up fast. The food is prepared lovingly and presented flawlessly. I've never had anything less than great service, and it's always a pleasure to eat there.  Prices aren't nearly as expensive as you might think for a restaurant of that caliber. And be prepared to valet, as that's the only way you can park (unless you're staying at the resort).  Great place to go for date night, to impress the boss or out of town visitors!"}
{"text":"I live in San Francisco which great food and fabulous ambiance is found in every corner of our great city .  ( very hard to please )  Me and my husband had our third anniversary dinner at elements . Truly amazing in every sense .. Five star and more amazing food , service was attentive, friendly, and knowledgable about menu and ingredients.  A true gastronomic and sensual joy.  Is there a six star rating?"}
{"text":"This update is based on dining there last May.  It was a surprise birthday dinner for one of the guests.  Server didn't seem well groomed and needed to brush his teeth.  Drinks were empty for extended periods.  My fish was undercooked and the manager didn't seem that worried about it when I pointed it out to him.  Food quality declined for sure.  The tuna appetizer was good though and the view as always made for a nice atmosphere.  Most everyone was content with the food but no one raved about it.  The server dropped dessert menus when I had instructed a bday dessert tray w candle to come out.  Some one must've reminded him bc 5 min later he hastily picked up our dessert menus.  No coffee was offered and the bday guest wanted a cappaccino.  He didn't want to wait any longer so decided not to pursue it.  I was very annoyed with the server by now and thought that the bday guest should get a friggin cappaccino if he wanted one, so I went to some servers and asked them to bring one.  When the check came, the receipt with the added gratuity was behind another copy w out it and the credit card slips so the person paying nearly tipped again but caught it before he did.  Very very disappointing.  What happened to this place."}
{"text":"We went to here for our anniversary dinner. It was very nice atmosphere, service, drink and food. Everything was amazing!  This place is great for special day."}
{"text":"Want a scenic view mixed with an amazing atmosphere. This is the place for you. Add in a meal that is presented with as much beauty as the views and this place is unbeatable. Defiantly  worth a try for an upscale birthday or date night."}
{"text":"very disappointed.  The foie gras was a very small portion and not well paired, the pork chop was of good quality but over cooked...the fish was dry...the waiter inattentive.  I will not return.  Too bad...nice setting"}
{"text":"Had a business lunch here and can highly recommend for this purpose.  The outdoor seating is perfect --- amazing PV views and resort scenery.  The food was outstanding and reasonably priced for the quality."}
{"text":"2nd time here and just as good as the first time! Two of us had the short rib. Loved it!! Also had two very unique deserts. One was peanut butter something, the other was a decadent cheesecake. Great place for birthdays, Christmas parties etc."}
{"text":"Culinary perfection. I could stop there...  The Feng shui is evident from the entry walk.  The architecture feels like we are part of something important. The view is one on the best available in the Phoenix valley. The water served is crystal clear in delicate stemware. Let's talk food! OMG BOOM POW WOW!  I delighted in my omelet ranchero. I've never experienced better. Unlike anything I have ever experienced. The daughter revelled in what was called eggs benedict but was a ridiculous combination of salivary explosions.  The wife went for miso salmon salad. The fish was perfectly prepared and matched with greens and spice.  What a treat! If you have never, you must. If you have, repeat over and over."}
{"text":"This place was amazing....food, decor, location and service were top notch.  I just wish we were there for the sunset.  There is a sexy outside seating area off the bar....looks like a great view."}
{"text":"Come during sunset. So romantic. The view is amazing. I have never been to Arizona before and this view is just everything I would have thought Arizona to look like. Red, Rocky Mountains, blush pink, orange and blue skies. The food was very good. Had the miso salmon. Service was on point too. Is kinda upscale here so definitely dress more than casual (cute dress and heels :) Ahhhh, the ambience!"}
{"text":"It is the ever changing menu that brings me in to Elements about once a month and my confidence in Chef Beau's creations. The ever changing menu generally changes about once a month. With every change I am there!!  Although the menu changes nearly every month they're a few items that to the core stay the same but has invited new guests to hang out for the \"Mouth Party\". Every menu change focuses on whats in season, what's fresh locally and I'm guessing Chef's mood. The core menu items that will usually make it to the dance are Foie Gras, Escargot, Elemental Soup, Duck Breast, Filet Mignon and Seafood. Sometimes he knocks these dishes out of the park while other times they FAIL. The most recent menu 3/2011 was not particularly my favorite. The Elemental soup was basically a water based Mushroom Boullion and it was weak. The Calamari was very, very, very amateure and the Duck failed to impress. Some highlights of Beau's recent menu were the Foie, and the 5 spice pork osso buco??? The pork with the Buddah buns really hit on all points.   The reason I give this place 4 stars is because it well deserves it. The reason in which I don't give 5 is because I order around 7-8 dishes and every time most impress but there is always one or two that are complete misses and I get pissed. Foie Gras pudding....nope, Dayboat Scallops were really missing there nutty, buttery sweetness and the sear on these gigantic suckers was not present. Others however like Escargot pot pie / Escargot Wontons and the most recent Escargot spring rolls wrapped in phyllo was killer. I trust Beau with every Foie dish and any Pork dish. The Kurabata Pork Belly Fried Rice is Killer.   Make your reservation for an outside table about 40 minutes prior to sunset for what I consider to be one of the best locations to enjoy an excellent dinner with a beautifull sunset. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"I probably would've given Elements 5 stars, especially based on the food (the filet was outstanding), the ambiance and our server (I think his name was Sean, he really listened and took care of us, even giving us a free desert for my wife's birthday), but I made a reservation and asked for a booth with a view online for my wife's birthday. Instead of reserving one for us, they just said we could wait 45 minutes if we wanted. No apology. No explanation. Just, you can wait if you want. So, while I pleased with the food & our server, the customer service of the hosts needs work."}
{"text":"Was recently in Scottsdale and went to Elements for a birthday celebration! All I can say is Elements has absolutely the best happy hour in all of Scottsdale, hands down! Drinks are $6.00 for designer cocktails (had the blueberry/taragon collins) and appetizers are $6.00 for generous portions that are delectable! Ordered the pork sliders, house made potato chips, and the hummus with vegetables. Waitstaff was attentive and efficient. Honestly, the appetizers and drinks would have been enough to feed my family of five. The cocktails offered on the happy hour menu are refreshingly creative (we all tasted each other's cocktails and couldn't decide who had the best). Everything was delicious and the view fantastic. What a wonderful place to get out of the desert sun and enjoy some libations! Will definitely make it a point to dine there every time I'm in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Why an excellent way to spend a girls night!  The service here is exceptional, everyone worked as a team, our table was consistently being looked after, and all the staff was attentive and helpful!   For appetizers: the dumplings, absolutely phenomenal. It was first time having dumplings with no meat but they were perfectly the flavored and the sauce was the best part!  For entrees:  The lobster carbonara. Extremely rich with large chunks of lobster (no skimping here!). I ended up taking leftovers home.    The filet wrapped in bacon: perfectly tender! This will be the dish of choice next time I am here. Biting into this was absolute heaven and I was insanely envious that it was not my entree.   Chicken: I cannot remember the formal name of this dish, but it was chicken with au jus. The chicken was moist, which is always my number one worry when ordering chicken. The skin was crispy and the au jus was the highlight of the dish.  Now, my favorite tasting from the evening was a side I ordered for the table. The brussel sprouts! You will not regret ordering this side. It's tossed with large chunks of pancetta and kimchi. Not too spicy, not overly heavy. Perfection! I am already dreaming about eating this again."}
{"text":"Phenomenal service.  Demi was an exceptional server. Food was off the charts. Views are incredible."}
{"text":"Just visiting Scottsdale for a couple of days. I would highly recommend this restaurant. The view is amazing and the food is amazing. Pricy but worth the quality food. Very nice."}
{"text":"Top 5 restaurants I've ever been to.  Everything is outstanding.  Best mussels I've eaten in my life."}
{"text":"We came here for the happy hour (because we couldn't afford the dinner menu) and it turned out to be a great experience. We originally came here because we saw it featured as one of the \"best places for patio dining\" and truly, the views were spectacular (although we couldn't sit outside since it was 110 degrees!). We ordered margaritas and for food the potato chips, quesadilla, and mini burgers. All were delicious and had generous portions. The staff was also very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"This is prolly one of the best overall restaurants in the valley for us . Food was cooked perfectly. They used quality ingredients in their dishes. Their kurobuto pork is amazing . We had a awesome server name dan who explained everything on the menu for us and recommended the perfect wine pairings for our meal. We also went during the sunset and the views are amazing... definitely recommend"}
{"text":"We've been here several times and EVERY single time has been amazing. Service, food, cocktails, and atmosphere (the view is fucking amazing and so smart in a business standpoint) People are friendly as soon as we valeted through dinner. I want to add that we forgot our business x amount of dollars in the car and not one dollar was taken."}
{"text":"I took my wife here for her 30th birthday.  The views as everyone else has stated are WELL worth the visit.  We arrived in mid January for a 6pm reservation and the sun had just set, leaving a breathtaking view of the surrounding mountains.  The colors in the sky were captured perfectly in the floor to ceiling glass that fronts the entire restaurant.    Service was great but the food was merely good...not great.  I had the lamb and my wife had the fillet.  I would say hers was better than mine but neither were out of this world.  Especially considering the price.  That said, it is a must visit in the Valley for the views and ambiance alone."}
{"text":"Though not as high up as advertised (close to the base of the mountain), it was elevated enough to provide gorgeous of the beautiful desert landscape.  The miso soup was okay, but the best dish of our party was the succulent bacon-wrapped beef."}
{"text":"My wife and I dined at Elements on Valentine's Day.  We were looking forward to it but, unfortunately, were very disappointed.  The first three courses (of the prix fixe five course dinner) arrived in rapid succession.  We had barely finished one dish when they yanked the plate away and brought the next one.  It felt like they were trying to hurry us out of the restaurant.  That changed dramatically when we had to wait 45 minutes for the main course.  The couple at the next table arrived 40 minutes after us and were ordering dessert while we waited for our main course to arrive.  It was so bad that they leaned over and said they felt guilty about getting served ahead of us when they arrived so long after we did.  They had ordered the same two main courses as we did and were concerned that they were served our dinners, which may very well have happened. When customers apologize to other customers in this way, you know there's a problem.  When our main courses finally arrived, they served my order to my wife and vice versa. It was like \"who ordered the steak\"--something I might expect in a diner but not at a restaurant with such pretensions. The food was only fair and much too salty.  Dinner was over $400 with a mid priced bottle of wine.  For this price, we expected a first rate experience which we obviously did not get by a long shot.  I brought the problem to the attention of the manager.  Her unhelpful and seemingly uncaring response: \"I hope you will come back and give us another chance.\"  Why in the world would I want to spend $400 again to risk another bad experience, especially when there are much better restaurants in the area. My advice is to stay far away."}
{"text":"Foigra was delicate and light...lobster was heavenly and fresh...Petaluma Chicken was very tender and perfectly tasty...cheesecake was unique and perfect...service was awesome."}
{"text":"So not good.    Most things were substandard.  My potato soup with chorizo was delicious.  But other than that, so off the mark.  For instance, my salad was swimming in vinaigrette.  So sour!  That's a Denny's mistake.  My crab fried rice had decent pieces of snow crab, but a strange, off-putting tang that lingered.  When I factor in prices, I start feeling anger and regret over my dinner choice.  Service started off slow (on a slow night), and then ended up downright dismissive.  Elements does have a beautiful view, and I would whole-heartedly recommend it for drinks with out-of-towners.  But if you care at all about food, keep going."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here.  Great fine dining atmosphere, service was friendly and professional.  Our server was Lisette (not sure if I spelled it correct).  She was happy to recommend but didn't come across as dictating, very down to earth.  I had the beat and burrata starter, excellent.  The winter kale salad was also excellent.  Only one problem at this point, portions here are not your typically fine dining size, they are very generous so I'm already worried about finishing my forthcoming main entrée.  Which by the way was the NY Strip, cooked medium rare +.  Many restaurants say they cook to that temperature, but many are pretenders.  Congrats to Chef Beau and his team, they nailed it!  Simply outstanding.  Speaking of the Chef, he happily met us, took a photo and thanked us for coming, this was while they were still busy. He couldn't have been more hospitable.  Well done on all aspects, I hope everyone else gets the same level of performance when they go."}
{"text":"This is more of a warning than a review.  The place is great, get a sunset reservation, enjoy the bar, food is good to excellent, and bring your wallet.  Others have said it all here.  My warning is DO NOT SPEED ON E. MCDONALD!!!  It is a complete Paradise Valley \"speed trap\" in the truest sense of the word!  I was tagged with a mobile photo ticket  van parked just down hill from the entrance to the restaurant.  They basically set it up to catch unsuspecting tourist going to the Sanctuary.  The valet guys were aware of it and said they do it all the time.  Despite the bummer of the start to my evening and the additional expense it added (Probably a $600 night with ticket) I still enjoyed dinner there and would recommend it.  I think my date wasn't too happy with me as I wasn't exactly in a great mood, this was my third AZ (read points on license) photo ticket in 6 months (all less than 15 over).... total money grab rip off!"}
{"text":"I have always wondered if food quality suffers due to show appearance of  celebrity chef, and restaurant over-expansion.  Mesa Grill at Las Vegas was quite good, but Morimoto at Napa Valley was disappointing.  Fortunately, Elements at Sanctuary has a strong team to carry out the vision of chef Beau Macmillan.  The overall dining experience was on par with some of the best Michelin one star restaurants.  The open view overlooking the Camelback Mountain was spectacular.   The Kurobuta pork belly failed to impress.  It was presented in the form of upscale ramen.  The idea was good, but the execution fell short with flavor on the lighter side.  We ordered quite a few other dishes:  Hudson Valley Foie Gras Ever since California placed a foie gras ban, I made sure to order it whenever possible.  I thought it was a pate dish, but it turned up with a piece of nicely seared foie gras.  I have no complain on this one.   Kurobuta Pork Chop This is a must try if you a pork chop lover.  It was tender and full of flavor.  I had the opportunity to taste some amazing pork chops, and this easily made my list of top five."}
{"text":"Spectacular!  You definitely get what you pay for at Elements.  The pork chop with cherry garlic glaze and the Foie Gras appetizer are superb.  Our waiter Jim was great!   It was an outstanding experience!"}
{"text":"Nice place. Good food. Gorgeous view. Sunday thru Wednesday 1/2 price off all bottles of wine. Not a bad deal for a great wine list!!"}
{"text":"I'll skip all the preambles and get right to it.  We ate here for lunch and dinner and enjoyed both tremendously.    Service was friendly and efficient (thanks Ingrid and Mark!) and the setting is lovely.  Lunch -- turkey burger and hot dog.   Both were just the right size for lunch yet something different.      Dinner -- calamari appetizer, braised ribs, duck, and butterscotch pudding for dessert.   Good portions and so flavorful.   Everything written about these dishes is true.   Very impressive.  BTW -- my wife LOVES the blackberry vodka drink.    If someone has the recipe....."}
{"text":"What a treat this restaurant is! The food was very unique, combinations of ingredients that most of us don't think of. And every last bite of it was amazing. Additionally, the staff is very genuine and friendly.  We went in the evening and the view was breathtaking!"}
{"text":"If there ever were a restaurant in the valley that made me think that I had died and gone to foodie heaven, it's Elements. Not only is the food top notch, but the entire ambiance, inside and out, is fantastic. Who'd have thought being seated in the back corner would be the perfect spot? Not only did we have a nice view of the Sanctuary's pool and several parts of the resort, but we were also treated to a breathtaking angle of the sun setting over the mountain. It was the perfect romantic setting for an anniversary dinner.   I had very high expectations and the food exceeded them. We started with the bbq duck confit. I cannot give a description of the chickpea pancake it's served in justice. I will only say that this was far and away the best duck I have ever had. For entrees we enjoyed the bbq short ribs \"korean style\" and char grilled flat iron. The short ribs were tender and fell apart with every scrape of the fork as they should. The sauce was incredible. I am convinced that it could have been poured on anything to make it good. The flat iron steak was wonderful. Perfectly cooked and well complimented by the corn spoonbread and mushrooms it was served with. My girlfriend rarely eats red meat, and she was not disappointed that we almost exclusive consumed beef products.   We weren't even given the chance to look at the dessert menu. I had mentioned it was our one year anniversary when the waitress casually asked if we were celebrating anything. A few moments after our dinner plates were taken, the waitress returned with a beautifully presented plate filled with what I can only describe as a chocolate dome, with a scoop of chocolate ice cream, and little black balls around it. The plate had \"happy Anniversary\" piped on it. It turns out it was their pb bomb. Chocolate peanut butter decadence! The little black balls were pop rocks. I don't know who was brilliant enough to put a gimmicky snack into a classy dessert. But you, my friend, are indeed a culinary genius.   I can now see why Chef Beau Macmillian is a regular on the Food Network. His menu is delicious. I cannot wait to return."}
{"text":"Six of us came for my daughter's 17th birthday celebration dinner, and it was perfect. The food was delicious; the view was stunning as the sun set over the mountains and the lights came on. Our server Denise was attentive without being overwhelming and playfully teasing with my 13-year-old son, and she made my daughter feel very special throughout the meal; at the end, she brought a board with a few desserts and candles, which was lovely. We were there for 2.5 hours and never felt rushed or as if we were waiting too long. We had six different meals; all were cooked exactly as we asked (and we are somewhat picky). I had opah with forbidden rice and greens; my husband had short ribs and brussel sprouts with bacon; my daughter had miso salmon. Peanut-butter bomb and s'mores desserts were both ridiculously decadent. A special place for special occasions. We hadn't been in a few years--so glad that it is just as good as we remembered!"}
{"text":"I've been to Jade Bar a couple of times for drinks, and I've always been really impressed.  Friendly service, tasty beverages and a great atmosphere both indoors and outdoors.  Following trips to both Peru and Chile, I was on a pisco sour kick for awhile last year, and this bar has the best in the city (as chosen after a pisco sour bar crawl, where it beat out Culinary Dropout and Trader Vics).  After eyeing Elements each time we came to drink, my boyfriend and I finally decided to give it a try for my birthday this past weekend.  The dining room was filled and energetic but still had a romantic feel sitting by the window overlooking the mountains.  For appetizers, we went with the foie gras and the crab stuffed artichoke.  Both were ok, but the foie was a bit overpowered by the super rich and buttery blackberry-filled tart and on the pricey side ($21) for the size of the protein.  The entrees, on the other hand, were outstanding.  We ordered the diver scallops and the kurobuta pork chop and were extremely impressed with both the quality of the ingredients and the creativity of the dishes.  The pork chop was incredibly juicy and paired well with the (light) cherry glaze.  The diver scallops were cooked perfectly and went well with the sweet pea risotto.  Finally, the service - great.  Our waiter took a little longer than he had intended to put in our main dishes and comped us a half bottle of wine for the \"wait\".  It was a really nice gesture, especially considering we wouldn't have even noticed!  I was waffling between 4 and 5 stars, but the amazing location, great service and the pork chop put it over the top - we can always choose different appetizers next time!"}
{"text":"Went here tonight for dinner and first off the service is impeccable. Next the view...Hands down the best view in town. (See pics)  Cuisine: We started with the edamame which were very good. Next we have a Farmer's salad which was a little spicy with a sesame dressing and was delicious.   Main course: The Duck which was the best I've ever had. We also ordered the eggplant dish which was meh. I won't be ordering that again.  We were too full for dessert but received 2 mini chocolate chip cookies with our check. (Ate them up within seconds)  Our waiter CJ was fantastic and was so Leo.   Thank you for an amazing experience tonight."}
{"text":"Elements / Jade Bar 5700 East McDonald Drive Paradise Valley, AZ  85253  We arrived at Elements @ 5:30 and were seated immediately. The venue is impressive with views overlooking the Phoenix Mountain Preserve. Our waiter and the Maître D promptly presented themselves at our table. We were asked about drink orders, and given some wonderful Crusty Bread and a small dish of Extra Virgin Olive Oil to spread on it. Nice and fruity with wonderful taste. This was a great way to start off our meal. Companion ordered a Cosmo which was pronounced very good, and I ordered a Brandy Alexander, an old time cocktail that most bartenders have no idea how to make. This was close to perfect, only missing a touch of nutmeg on the top.  Our first appetizer was a Baked Oyster a la Rockefeller. It might have been the best item of the entire meal. Succulent oysters on a bed of spinach with a touch of Chinese Lap Chong sausage baked into it. The only word we could think of to describe it was yum! It was truly memorable. For our next appetizer, we had Duck Confit Mushu. Little pillows filled with duck confit, gently cooked and topped with a little salad and a piece of mandarin orange, sitting in a peanut sauce. These were very tender and very light.  Our main appetizer was Steak Tartar. Unlike what many places serve where the steak is ground up, this was obviously hand chopped, lightly seasoned with an egg yolk floating on top and served with some wonderful Crostini. On the side was some Fried Kale that was nothing short of amazing in flavor. An altogether very satisfying dish.  Next came salads. Companion ordered the Kale Salad with Mandarin Oranges. The salad also contained the largest blueberries I have ever seen along with beet chips and orange beets. Companion could have made a meal out of just the salad. I ordered the Buckwheat Noodle salad, which came with julienned green onions, julienned carrots, fresh edamame and, I believe cranberry beans. These last two items really made the salad sing.  Our main courses arrived, and I could not believe the size of my portion. Huge doesn't begin to describe it. A giant double cut Kurobuta Pork Chop with a Korean glaze served over a medley of mushrooms, sweet potato cubes and shiso leaves. The chop came with a giant knife which is the only ding I have for the meal. Since the knife is serrated it tended to tear the beautifully tender pork which did it an injustice. This piece of meat deserves a nice knife with a sharp edge instead of a serrated blade.  Companion ordered the special of the day, which was Seared Halibut on a bed of perfectly cooked Risotto with lemon and coconut flavors. The sear was perfection, and it was topped with a small amount of a chicken and veal stock mixture. Again, the portion size was huge but companion made a valiant effort to eat it all. In the end, a doggie bag won out!  Last was dessert. I ordered the Butterscotch Pudding Torte. I hadn't had Butterscotch since I was a child, and this brought back wonderful memories. A pool of butterscotch with a piece of dense but moist cake sitting on it. This was then covered with a tuile cookie which was topped with a wonderful coconut sorbet. Probably 2,000,000 calories, but you don't come here to count calories.  Companion ordered the Banana Bacon Bourbon Parfait, a whimsical dessert served in a mason jar. It was served with a layer of chocolate milk cream, a layer of caramel popcorn, and topped with candied pecans.  The restaurant was spotless, and examination of the restroom showed it to also be spotless and nicely stocked with amenities.  This restaurant serves a truly amazing meal complete with amazing service. If I defined the food of this restaurant in one word it would be fresh.  I give them the easiest 5 stars I have ever given out."}
{"text":"I made reservations through OpenTable and stated we were celebrating a birthday. From the moment we arrived until we left the service was exceptional. I server was amazing. I wish I could remember his name. He made a few suggestions and I'm glad we ordered the oysters for our appetizer. Our main entrees were also really good as was the smores dessert. The whole experience was amazing. At the end they gave my friend a birthday cupcake which I thought just made the evening extra special and showed me the restaurant cared about making it special."}
{"text":"the view alone is worth 5 stars.  the ambience was perfect and the food was tasty!  definitely going back."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite upscale restaurants in Paradise Valley. It features an incredible view of camelback mountain, try to call ahead and get a table outside during sunset. Every time I've gone, the food and service has been fantastic. Also love the live music in the bar area!"}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday dinner, Cooper our server was extremely engaging and fun. Food was delicious and came out at a fantastic time. Drink selection, especially the wine is exquisite. Will definitely be back and would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"The best view in town. Was such an amazing time. Was able to see the sunset, while we ate dinner. Food and service was fantastic. Would recommend this place"}
{"text":"Truly a delight! The staff always makes you feel like you are a king!! The environment is relaxing a serene.  The food is amazing!!  Gabino is a rock star!!  Thanks again for treating us to another truly amazing experience!!"}
{"text":"When I purchased dinner as a silent auction item, I knew it would be amazing, but I didn't know what would truly be included in the \"Dinner for Two\".  On our early arrival, we went to the Jade bar to wait for our reservation. See review for that spot soon. Once it was time for our reservation, we were taken outside with a heater and the sunset began. Our server was amazing!!! We handed him our silent auction item and he gladly proclaimed, \"everything is on us tonight, including gratuity, so you just have to take care of your drinks and we will be on our way!\". We were literally blown away -he told us we could order anything off the menu and as much as we wanted.  We didn't want to be too greedy, so we figured we would stick with the app, meal, dessert mentality. What we didn't realize were how HUGE the portions are and how much food that ended up being!   App: we started with the calamari and the escargot pot pie. Both delicious. The calamari was a more traditional preparation of what I was used to...no no no, no marinara sauce here people, I mean sweet and spicy and lightly dressed and battered so you got the tenderness and not the overpowering bread and sauce. Escargot pot pie you ask? Amazing. Light cream sauce in a homemade fluffy puff pastry top-not chewy in the least.  Next, we had soup and salad. The soup was a potato soup with scallops and the salad was a light and refreshing daikon and apple with a light black pepper dressing topped with nuts and pomegranate seeds. I loved the salad and hubby loved the soup. I liked the base of the soup but the scallops tasted fishy to me.  For dinner, hubby had the market special of black bass (I think) with rice and veggies and I had the Korean braised short ribs with kimchi fried rice and veggies. A-MAZ-ING. We were so full at this point that I was lucky enough to have leftovers which were even better the next day.   We had a few glasses of wine and the server even brought out an extra drink that was made, an in house pear infused vodka drink! YUM. We will definitely be going back here for special occasions with friends and have already been back to the Jade bar just to enjoy being close to the kitchen and vibes."}
{"text":"Amazing aesthetics.  Sunset here makes everything all right in the world.  Lively bar scene.  The food is pricey; I was not knocked out by the chef's creativity, the service, or food presentation.  All were good, but not enough to draw the extra star.  Go for drinks."}
{"text":"Loved it!  Sat on terrace overlooking beautiful gardens & Praying Monk.  Food was exceptional (Sea Bass with Miso Glaze atop corn rissoto and an app of gnocchi w/pork, chives, parmesan....outstanding!) and service attentive.  Pricey (of course, this is Paradise Valley, after all) but would definitely return for a special occasion."}
{"text":"This is a great place to seal deals of all sorts. IE, if your lady isn't putting out, this is a great way to say \"pretty pretty please\" without actually having to grovel.   I am a lady, so, you know, I know this ploy works.  I was impressed by the whole package. There were minor setbacks that were resolved above my expectations; when we couldn't locate our waiter and asked a back server to assist, he was eager to do so. This is unusual, as any type of back service (bar back, back server, et cetera) is rarely empowered to give first-hand help and are typically instead instructed to alert the server. So this was a delightful touch.  The food was wonderful and very multi-dimensional. The wine list was extensive and the drink selection was great, too.   Great cigar selection, too!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is so beautiful. You can see all the lights of Scottsdale and Phoenix and the gorgeous mountains. We valeted the car and got a great table facing all the mountains. Started with the tuna tartare and it was so amazing. It had beautiful tuna, roasted pine nuts, super thin cucumber slaw and ginger. For the main course I had miso glazed salmon well done (otherwise it would come medium well), it was so deliciously flaky and savory. Would definitely get this again.       I usually never get desert, but the honey panna cotta was perfect for me, it was so light and not too sweet with lemon curd and pickled strawberries. I actually finished it, which is a first. But a great ending to a lovely meal. The service was impeccable and they even gave me a cupcake to take home! Awww. I didn't want to make a big deal of my b-day. Absolutely love this place and will try to make reservations when the sun is setting for spectacular views."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to an amazing experience at Elements, but unfortunately it was just ok. The food was good, but the service was absolutely terrible! At one point during my birthday dinner I went to the bar to get a glass of wine for myself since my husband and I had been sitting without drinks for 15 minutes. When our server finally reappeared after our plates had been cleared, he brought us the check and walked away. I was in need of another glass of wine (for dessert of course!), but I ended up going to the bar yet again. No matter how good the view and or the food may be, it's not worth dealing with the bad service."}
{"text":"Stop by at Elements for a romantic night with my boyfriend. From the start the service was amazing. We started with the Calamari and they were to die for. I had the short ribs and my boyfriend had the filet, both of which was delicious. Our waiters were great and attentive. Truly impressed by this restaurant. We'll be back for sure!  Go for an unforgettable meal and incredible view!!"}
{"text":"Elements is hard to beat.  The views of Camelback Mountain are fantastic.  This place is perfect for a romantic dinner at sunset.  I've had several meals here from breakfast to dinner and everything that I have tasted here has been done right.  The bacon wrapped filet is perfect.  The mashed potatoes are out of this world.  The Elemental breakfast is a lot of food but all of it is done so well.  The bakery basket is also very good, but varies from day to day.  The service is exceptional here - they really go out of their way to make sure your dining experience is top notch.  It is a bit pricey, but well worth it.  This is my go to for date night."}
{"text":"While on vacation in Scottsdale, AZ a friend of mine I was with suggested that we attempt to dine at this restaurant.  I tried calling for a last minute reservation for the next night but as expected the restaurant was at full capacity and no reservations were available.  After getting out of an event that ran late the next night (Sunday night) I called the restaurant while my party of 7 were leaving our event and I asked if by chance they had room for us for a late seating.  The hostess recommended we come in and they would see what they could do for us.  At worst, they told us that the bar and outside deck was available at this time and we would be seated there (worst case scenario).  Our party decided to go for it.    We got there for a 9pm seating and lucky for us the main dining room had opened up and there was a large table smack in the middle of the dining room, a short distance away from the host stand.  We were seated right away and this is where the fun begins.  Sean was our waiter, and what a treat.  He had the driest sense of humor that we all have seen in quite some time and he was ridiculously honest.  His knowledge of the menu, wines and food was completely on point.  Our table decided to share what turned out to be 3/4 of the menu.  For apps we got:  old bay poached shrimp /  tuna tartare / beef carpaccio  / hudson valley foie gras  / fiery calamari and shishito peppers.  All of which were a 10 of 10 presentation and taste wise.  Dinner was off to an amazing start.  We also started off with a \"middle of the road\" white wine.  For dinner we again went family style and shared the following:  The short ribs, lobster carbonara, double bone kurabuta pork chops, miso glazed salmon, petaluma chicken and bacon wrapped filet.    The short ribs could have been eaten with a spoon.  As you would expect they were super moist with a melt in your mouth quality.  The pork chops had exceptional flavor.  The salmon and the chicken were also very good. My favorite out of all of these dishes, the one that stood above the rest however was the lobster carbonara.  This dish had many levels of flavor, from a savory, slightly salty fish flavor of the lobster but quickly turned to a creamy, slightly sweet flavor of the white cream sauce.  It was spectacular.  We also had a high end bottle of red with dinner which paired great with the food.  No dessert... we were full!   One of my friends in this dinner party later emailed Beau MacMillan to tell him not only what a tremendous meal we had, but of the tremendous courtesy that the entire staff provided us with amid the late seating on last second notice on Christmas Eve.  To our surprise Chef MacMillan emailed my friend back within 48 hours and told him he was flattered by our review and extremely happy that our server in particular that night took care of us but was not surprised because he was \"by far\" one of his best servers in that restaurant and he was glad we got to experience him.   When I go back to Scottsdale I will absolutely be going back here for more.  5 stars."}
{"text":"Honestly, all I want to write is \"eat here, you're welcome\" but for those of you who need a little more encouragement, read on.  I was lucky enough to visit this place during Restaurant Week and try several items on the menu. We started off with the calamari and the carrot and millet pot stickers. The calamari had a slight kick to it, due to the dressing which topped it off, but it was the perfect kick. I HATE CARROTS but suffered through eating one of the pot stickers, then continued to finish the plate because they were so delicious. They were soaked in an amazing base which really went well with the carrots.   Second course, Lobster Carbonara and Miso Glazed salmon. The lobster chunks were massive, and I would highly recommend ordering this. Every bite tasted a little different, and a little better. Even when I had the left overs the next day for lunch. The portion sizes are large enough to share. Salmon was perfectly cooked and came with a small bit of pasta as accompaniment. You really can't go wrong with either of these.  At this point, my glutinous little body couldn't say no to a dessert. I enjoyed the peanut butter ball, which is literally a giant peanut butter ball, covered with chocolate, topped with caramel popcorn, and all of these things combined to make my dream dessert.   The servers are all wonderful, as we interacted with several people. Definitely make a reservation for the Patio. It is absolutely BEAUTIFUL and as I am writing this (maybe not while you are reading) the weather is perfect to dine during the sunset. Don't get discouraged if you have to wait a little for your reservation; it is a really wonder view and people tend to take a little more time enjoying their meals."}
{"text":"In my opinion, this place has the best service and view in the city hands down. Not to discount the food, which was amazing as well. However, this place understands that dining out is not only about the food -- it's about the experience. This place has that down. Don't change a thing."}
{"text":"We began with a drink at the bar. What a great way to start off the evening, but the best was yet to come.  We were seated at a table for dinner with a spectacular view and were able to watch a beautiful sunset. The service was outstanding and the food was some of the best we have ever had anywhere.  It was a perfect dining experience from start to finish."}
{"text":"This was my second visit. They hit all the right notes. Sunset and view lived up to my expectations. Our server was spot on. Everyone thought the meal was great. I had fresh  cold oysters. We had Sea Bass, filet mignon, and salmon. All perfectly prepared and plated. Was an elegant evening."}
{"text":"Unsurpassed !!!!    Our Dinner in the new \"Praying Monk\" dining area of Elements was fantastic... the view... spectacular!!   The new dining area is awesome... more intimate and less \"active\" then then the main dining room, with warm wood tones and floor to ceiling sliding glass doors that permit uninterrupted views of Paradise Valley!  We noticed 2 outdoor seating areas, which, in cooler weather...would be PRIME SEATING!!!  We started  with *ahi tuna tartar and the elemental soup ... both were amazing...  the Tuna, perfectly balanced on a bed of seasoned cucumber \"pasta\" coupled with 3 sesame pancakes... the squash soup was velvety with a \"tempura\"  squash blossom floating as a center piece... a perfect beginning...  Our salads were perfect; the Caesar was lightly dressed and far from the gloppy mess that many establishments offer... the  tomato & watermelon mosaic salad was AMAZING... perfectly ripened heirloom tomatoes, fresh \"shaved\" watermelon and a flavorful  charred pepper sorbet .. the light herbed dressing that was \"whispered\" on the plate enhanced the entire dish ...   My guest enjoyed the nights special,  grilled Lamb... which, I didn't get a chance to review.  It apparently was so good... he didn't want to share.  I enjoyed a perfectly cooked pan roasted free range chicken \"kung pao\" style.  I was pleased that  the Kung Pao seasoning was engaged with the pearl pasta so I was able enjoy the chick two ways... natural & succulent...however I could also enlist the pasta to add the Kung Pao flavor.  The additional sides ordered were the  truffled mac n' cheese.. much lighter then expected, and the tender, tender, tender  grilled asparagus... YUM!!!  Deserts enjoyed were the german chocolate cake & coconut gelato along with the strawberry rhubarb funnel cake & buttermilk ice cream.  Both were decedent... but the coconut gelato was soooooooo good, we had to order another scoop.  I used to enjoy eating at the tables \"nudged\" up against the large windows facing the pool in the main dining room... but now that I've experienced the Praying Monk room... there will be no going back... the new dining area really is special!!!"}
{"text":"Well this place is a hidden gem ! the view is great and ambiance to match ! The service was really great all around, which i am huge on . the calamari was perfect, ask for the sauce on the side . The drinks were really yummy and did the trick . The main course of bacon wrapped filet with blue cheese dressing and whipped potatoes is my reason for the 4 stars .. although it was good it was entirely too heavy . The bacon & the blue cheese was a bit much - i could have done without both and the dish wouldn't been perfect ! but the lobster carbonara was yummy and the shrimp rice was out of this world !"}
{"text":"Came in for my birthday dinner and had a fantastic time. I regularly come to Jade Bar for cocktails, but it had been 2 years since eating at elements. This experience was so much better than the last in every way. I wish I could remember my servers name, but she was an absolute delight and did a fantastic job. The food was great too. Shoutout to Anna for the bomb bday dessert."}
{"text":"I do not typically write reviews, nor do I go to restaurants like this very often.  We had a dear friend give us a gift certificate for this place. My wife has always wanted to go here. Now is her chance. I have to say that the company was the best part of the night.  My wife ordered the short ribs. She LOVED them! perfectly seasoned and cooked. She had me take a taste and it was indeed good. Maybe great!  I had the Sea Bass special served over pork belly! I do not say food is \"the best\". However, this was the best food I have eaten. The seasoning was perfect, the flavors blended together perfectly. I have never had a piece of fish cooked so perfectly.   The staff and service was also AMAZING! From the time they opened my door to welcome us, to the time we said farewell! This place gets top scores all around!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are big fans of Chef Beau MacMillan and when we found out that he has a restaurant in Arizona, we bookmarked this place until we were in town again. The day we drove to Phoenix from Sedona, we felt it was time to stop in this place. We came here for lunch with our kids. The views in the restaurant was nice. The drinks you order from Elements comes from their bar, the Jade Bar.   I got their drink that had a jalepeno in it, it was hot! But so good! To start, we got the shrimp and pork pot stickers, it was really good and even my daughter ate most of it, which usually she only has a few bites.   For entrees, I got the smoked fried chicken with sticky rice, it had pickled vegetables and chopped up watermelon in it, it was so good. My husband got the thai chicken salad which was really good as well. My daughter had the grilled chicken with fruits, it was so pretty, I ended up having a few bites of her food too lol.  For dessert, we got the raspberry sorbet with the lychee lemongrass semifreddo with pistachio dust, it was so good.   Our waitress was very sweet and even offered to bring a second high chair over when she saw that my toddler wanted to sit in her sister's seat. I'm glad we got to experience Chef Beau's food. Another one of my favorite Food Network chefs' restaurant checked off the list."}
{"text":"Great service and a simple menu that ensures freshness. If the weather is nice, the scenic outdoor seating can be romantic and lovely."}
{"text":"Well, I just moved to Scottsdale and my family was finally coming to visit me.  I wanted to splurge and go somewhere special and had been reading the lovely reviews about Elements.  I go out often for my job and eat at five star restaurants often.  I was expecting a beautiful view, and great service, and was hopeful that the food was would be as amazing and special.  We had to change our reservation, as we were running late, and the female staff member that answered the phone was beyond helpful and provided us with an alternate time that worked.  When we arrived we were pleased and delighted with the gorgeous view and mid century modern furnishings.  That was the best part of the experience.  We were crammed next to another table who were speaking so loudly all we could hear was his voice. There was a scented candle on the table as well.  The server, who was originally attentive, tried to talk me out of ordering what was the best bart of the meal, besides the bread and edamame, a cocktail made with mescal.  The tuna was gummy in texture and did not taste appealing.  The server was very kind and took this off our bill, even though I told him that he did not have to, that I just wanted it taken away.  The calamari which was to be crispy and spicy was neither.  The duck pancake was undercooked and overwhelmed, and over seasoned with unappealing cabbage, soft tofu, and not near enough nuts, or duck, so it was a soggy disappointment. The short rib and mushroom ravioli, were also not prepared as described and again the flavors were not what was stated on the menu and the ravioli were doughy and not appealing.  The Brussels sprouts were not edible as they were overly sweet and the pork belly or bacon was mostly fat.  I think we must have ordered the restaurant's worst dishes perhaps.  The truffle macaroni and cheese was very good, I almost forgot to mention but there was just a hint, barely of truffle flavor.  Our server vanished once our meals were served and we did not see him again until we were ready to go.  So we were not able to ask for replacements and since everything was not to our liking, we actually did not know where we would start so we just let it go and the friendly busser cleared our dishes.  I would be happy to have a drink at the bar, but would not suggest a meal here or at least do not order what we ordered.  The two stars are for the ambiance, nice support staff and one star for the food.  I am sorry I was so looking forward to our one night out, it was a bad choice and hope that our visit was the rare exception."}
{"text":"Dinner here was amazing!! Great food, nice wine. Was with a big group and they kept up with the service.  Try and come for sunset  Thanks"}
{"text":"We were in Scottsdale for a bachelorette weekend and kicked off the festivities at Elements for brunch.   The views are AMAZING. You can see the mountains and the entire valley below.  The food was good - I got the albacore sashimi salad but probably wouldn't order it again. I tried a friend's penne & snap pea pasta and that was the real treat! The manager was very attentive and allowed us to walk around the property while we waited to go to our Airbnb."}
{"text":"The view is awesome; too bad the food and service are not at the same level to complete the total package.  I do not mind paying $300 for a great dining experience and have traveled the world doing so.  Elements just doesn't match up.  I made a reservation to celebrate my partner's 50th birthday based on reviews I had read on Yelp.  At the time of the reservation I mentioned the birthday event and partner's name to see what Elements would do. . . the answer was zero... no problem, but just one of the many places Elements misses the mark.  We arrived early and enjoyed cocktails in the Jade bar (even OK that they delivered the wrong drink).  At our scheduled time we moved to the dining room to be told that they were running late and would get a table as soon as possible.  I know this happens occasionally.  When I made the reservation I realized that there were some Primo tables that everybody raves about and I am of the belief that it is either the luck of the draw or being pushy and assertive that determines seating (silly me I thought a 50th could influence).  While we would have been comfortable almost anywhere, we where shown to what has to be the worst table in the room.  The table is at the back of the dining room situated between the two doors that servers use for kitchen access.  In the 3 minutes we were at the table there was a constant parade of servers on both sides of our table.  The fact that this table exists speaks loudly about the priorities of this establishment.  Our second table was Primo and we thought that we were on to a great dining experience.  The wait staff is cold and at times near rude.  There was nothing about any of the staff that was welcoming (including the bar, host, and servers).  After starters I went to use the toilet and when returned found my dinner on the table, not terrible but to me another faux pas that should not have happened.  We were each given 2 pieces of bread and when the plate was empty it was removed... it would have been nice to have been asked if we would have like more.  The food itself ranged from very good to OK.  Lobster red pepper bisque was good, though lukewarm; pork appetizer was the best dish.  My duck breast main was tough and did not have any noticeable flavor added, just duck.  We did enjoy the chocolate dessert.  When we requested the check it was dropped so quickly (no thank you for dining, I hope you enjoyed your evening!) and the waitress gone, that I did not get to hand her my in the ready credit card.  I was all set to really enjoy Elements based on the reviews... but they seem to be quite busy, so I am sure that will not miss my lack of return visits."}
{"text":"Here it goes, first review!   I took my lady to Elements on a Saturday night for dinner and wine.  The setting is ideal, very posh like a country club.  The view is spectacular.   The bread rolls were tasty, the accompanying hummus was really quite bland, however.  The \"Chowdah\" was fantastic, as was the nights special soup \"Coconut Shrimp & Yellow Squash\".  The \"Sweet Breads\" appetizer was good, if not a generic, Asian style flavor.  Hint: it's not bread.   The entrees, a filet and a pork chop were both large and well prepared.   All in all, the food was good, the soups were best, yet nothing jumped out at me and knocked me off my feet.  I wouldn't consider it worth the money, for it was an expensive meal.  However it was a great date night, and  I'll give it a go again sometime.  Three and three quarters stars."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast around 10am. Could not have been more satisfied. The ambiance was delightful, the view was incredible and our meals were very much to our enjoyment."}
{"text":"We go to Chef Beau McMillan's Elements about three times annually as we did again March 29th.  Always amazing, service, food, setting.  The attention to detail from our call to make a reservation about our daughter's birthday was simply amazing too.  This is \"the best\" Scottsdale, greater Phoenix restaurants and one of the better ones in the country in our opinion."}
{"text":"My wife made reservations with great anticipation from news and reviews.  Unfortunately, the meal we had left a lot to be desired.  While I won't say the food was horrible, nor the service, it was not that \"wow\" experience we were hoping for.  We ordered the kimchi bacon appetizer with Brussels sprouts and found too much fat and would have loved a few more brussels on the plate to enjoy the flavors.  The 45.00 filet had a fatty piece that seemed way too big for the cut meat.  I would assume the kitchen cuts from the loin and could've held this piece back.  The sticky rice I ordered to accompany dinner was very good, but came out late, well after I was thru half my meal.  Perhaps they had an off night, we received some bad plates or it just isn't our type of food.  Average is what I would consider this place and will continue to frequent El Chorro instead when dining in PV."}
{"text":"I thought I would be blown away and I was with the amazing view and beautiful decor! however, the food was nothing spectacular and our waitress was clueless!  We all got the tuna tartar, beef carppacio, salmon and ribs. Would I come back? Yes but this time JUST for drinks on the patio. There are too many other yummy restaurants around here to just settle!"}
{"text":"I am in Phoenix on business this week. I have been dying to try Elements, after meeting Chef Beau at a charity golf tournament. The view from the restaurant across the valley at night was spectacular. I love the lighting of the restaurant and the bar. They have the coolest patio heaters, and the bar was hopping.  Angela and Ken (if I remember their names right) were fantastic. Angela was extremely creative, and their selection of great whiskey and bourbon was really surprising.  I started with the Roasted Pork Belly. There were more fresh flavors to it than I can describe. I am a huge fan of hoisin, and this was perfect. I believe the adjective that was used was \"Sic\"!  I ordered the duck to follow that up. There was both duck breast and a leg. Terrific textures. The forbidden rice was really interesting and the whole dish was amazing.  Someone else at the bar ordered the warm butterscotch pudding torte, and passed it around. It was so creamy and decadent I could only have one bite. The coconut gelato on top was awesome!  Considering the crazy cool environment, the valet parking, and the phenomenal food, this was an absolute bargain. I will absolutely be coming back to Elements. Next time, I'll have to bring a crowd . I did post photo's of the meal on Food Spotting. This was a truly memorable meal."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience! Beautiful views, amazing food and attentive, courteous service. We made our anniversary reservation via OpenTable and asked for a table with a view. They gave us a great table and the hostess and server wished us happy anniversary. The food was delicious - everything I tasted. We enjoyed sashimi, dumplings, grilled scallops, braised short ribs, pumpkin cheesecake and a smores dessert. The server was so professional and pleasant. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I thought the food was just OK, but the service made up for what was lacking in the food. I had the Albacore Sashimi Salad which (again) was just OK.  My friends ordered and shared the Korean Steak and Sticky Rice Bowl.  There was a mayonnaise sauce on the rice that made me glad I didn't order it.  One friend liked the sauce, the other didn't.    We also ordered the hummus appetizer which was, well, hummus.  Nothing extraordinaire for $13.  There were a few cucumber slices stuck in it and then about four slices of fried taro (I think) root and some pita bread triangles.  One friend was having a birthday and the waiter brought a pretty individual white cake with a chartreuse frosting that was flavored with lime.  It was pretty good.  The view was nice....nothing outstanding.  As I first mentioned, service was impeccable.     My friend loved the restaurant and can't wait to go back.  I don't need to go again."}
{"text":"Great location to rub elbows with the rich and famous of Phoenix. Very pricy but once in a blue moon treat. Food 4 Atmosphere 5 Parking 5 Service 5 Value 2  Overall worth the price once in a while"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. The view is to die for. Right under camelback mountain. We sat on the patio and it was just relaxing and beautiful. The service was also top of the line. Our server was very attentive and the staff helped with clearing out table and refilling water. The whole team worked together so we had an amazing experience!  The food also was great!!!  I had the Cobb salad. It was fresh and I loved the dressing. My friend had soup of the day and the Cesar salad. I will be back. It's a great place to dine!"}
{"text":"One of my FAVORITES in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area! Their menu is a changing menu, but the best way to describe the food is american steakhouse with an Asian twist. From the sides of kimchi brussels sprout & bacon hash to my entree of miso glazed salmon - all of the food is on point. Some of our favorite appetizers included kimchi bacon and fiery calamari! Make sure to try a little bit of everything as all of the food was definitely on point.   As if the food wasn't enough - if the weather is nice you should also request to sit outside! Even if the sun has already sit, the great weather with the outdoor seating adds many more stars to this restaurant experience. Our first time here we sat inside, and it was just as great!   During the summer this year, on week nights they had half price bottles of wine, so that was also a cherry on top!  I hope you enjoy Elements as much as we did!"}
{"text":"08.31.14 | bookmarked 03.10.14  Labor day weekend. Bachelorette party. Brunch AND dinner at Elements. We so wild.  Elements is voted one of the best restaurants to watch a sunset. Floor to ceiling glass overlooking the Camelback Mountain, it did not disappoint.  The food was also excellent (hence the double meals). They serve (au gratis) freshly baked cinnamon buns. A-MA-ZING. I was not super adventurous and stuck with an omelet. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/elements-scottsdale?select=R6vOgslAxEOj3aN_J31gPA#7XBhTPInVYr6T-h6e7SemQ  For dinner, we started foie gras (I miss you so much). And oyster rockefellers. SO good. I had the widely ordered hawaiian nairagi for dinner, AND had enough left over for breakfast the next morning. They don't skimp on the portion here. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/elements-scottsdale?select=R6vOgslAxEOj3aN_J31gPA#R6vOgslAxEOj3aN_J31gPA  Thoroughly wonderful experience and a fantastic getaway."}
{"text":"The view is very nice and the restaurant is beautiful.  The food was disappointing.  It was like eating at PF Changs.   Nice wine list though"}
{"text":"Yes the view was gorgeous,  Yes the decor was elegant and pretty,  And Yes the food was delicious.  But if there's something that will make us come back is the service, and more than anyone it will be Denise.  Exquisite service and amazing experience provided by Denise!"}
{"text":"Even though the restaurant has one of the best views in town, the horrible service couldn't make up for it. Came for lunch on a Saturday, and even though at the time Elements wasn't super busy, we waited so long to be serviced that I had to wave down the hostess. She kindly brought our drinks and then when the waitress came to us to write down our orders and that was the only time we saw her. I had a Groupon voucher and had some problems with it. The manager rudely just told me to call Groupon. What an uncomfortable situation when I am here celebrating my husband's graduation! When the problem was solved, compulsory tip was added when good service never existed. I am sure to find great views of the beautiful area somewhere else."}
{"text":"This is the 4th time I've had dinner at Elements, this review is a long time coming. I go to Scottsdale annually and we have dinner here each time. The restaurants is absolutely beautiful perched on the hillside of Camelback mountain. You can watch the sunset which I think is the best time to have dinner or cocktails, the mountains change from tan to golden orange. Stunning and romantic. you must have reservations and request a booth at the very front of the restaurant where the windows are floor to ceiling overlooking the city of Scottsdale. The food is on point and everything is absolutely prepared to perfection besides being delicious! The rib eye I had,  melted in my mouth and I washed it down with a fabulous California Cab. My husband had the Pork  Chop which was like out of the Flintstones absolutely beautiful in appearance as well as being full of flavor. I love everything about this restaurant, the views, the service, the full bar and wine selection, and mostly to top it off the fabulous Food. Kudos to Executive Chef Beau MacMillan!!"}
{"text":"Very possibly my most superb dining experience ever!The food - asparagus leak soup, kimchi bacon, vodka and beet cured salmon, kurobuta pork chop and more were outstanding! So many flavors in each bite. The service was unique- I have never before been addressed by name throughout the entire meal at a public restaurant. The constructed and designed by people ambience is spectacular. So are the outside views."}
{"text":"Tips:  $115/person set menu with 4 courses on Valentine's Day  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  I came here for Valentine's day with my boyfriend and we had a great time.  Dishes: I got: dungeness crab bisque, duck, and an freddo My boyfriend got: pork belly, short rib, and chocolate fondue  Overall, the food was amazing and the atmosphere just as amazing. This is definitely the place to go to splurge on food, but the price is very reflective of the classiness of this restaurant and the setting."}
{"text":"I just had a dinner party here and it was an amazing place for a celebration! The waiter was a little strange, however, the service was great overall.   The mac & cheese appetizer is amazing & I absolutely loved the pork chop! The dessert was alright. Overall, would definitely return here and had a great experience!"}
{"text":"I was introduced to this restaurant by my parents, as we found out later on this is one of their get away places... I love this restaurant the location is very nice for special occasions.... We have dined and lounged at their bar many many times."}
{"text":"This review is not for the restaurant venue, but rather for the food, which was served on the terrace, at the bar and on the room. Overall, very good - but not super great. While the breakfast was outstanding, some of the other classic restaurant dishes seemed to be oddly assembled and some of the appetizers might have formerly been convenience food. The chefs attitude is great, especially compared to his famous colleagues as some of them are a......, esp the ones u see on TV (hey, B.... F...). Whoever is the pastry chef, deserves special recognition as of his/hers creations. At Elements I started my infamous pastry diet :-) Will we come back, hell yes, I am too lazy to leave the resort when I am in town."}
{"text":"Excellent views. Terrific food and great service. Also as a bonus it is reasonably priced in my opinion."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in the Scottsdale area hands down.  Amazing food, nice crowd and always consistant.  And it is never to loud - I recall going to Mastro's thinking it would be a \"nice\" place and felt like I surrounded by a bunch of over grown Frat Boys with too much money to blow - money doesn't mean class!  Being from Los Angeles and being spoiled by some great spots - this place is so wonderful and always have such a nice vibe.  I do however wish they would make their portions larger!"}
{"text":"Fabulous dinner. I love the resort as this is the first time I've stayed here. I have loved the restaurant since the first time I've come. I love the short ribs. The sashimi was amazing. Sean, my most recent waiter was fabulous. I really just enjoyed this weekend and my stay. :)"}
{"text":"First time here. Ordered the roasted chicken bento box, steak frittes, and tomato soup. For starters we had the chips bowl and a banana split desert. All in all the food was ok and way over priced. The bento box salad was over done with garlic and the chicken was dry. The fry's with the steak were extremely oily and same with the starters. Very disappointed based on some of the reviews we had read about this place."}
{"text":"Bring an appetite.  I can't remember eating at any other high-end restaurant that aspired to greatness with portion sizes this large.  But it did all taste great (the sodium definitely played a part).  The service didn't match the level of food.  During the course of dinner my server both shook my hand and patted me on the back.  I just wanted a nice, romantic meal, not to make a new buddy."}
{"text":"New to the area & had a birthday dinner to celebrate...we couldn't have chosen a better place! We started with drinks & the charred edamame in the bar area. The drinks were all delicious, but the edamame was other wordly! I don't know what they put on it, but it was addictively good!!  We move to the restaurant for dinner. We ordered the Crispy Kale salad (good), Hawaiian fish (can't remember the name), flat steak special & Brussels sprouts with pork belly. Everything was wonderful...the fish was really good, the steak flavorful & tender...but the Brussels sprouts were incredible & such a unique flavor! Ordered a bottle of wine & the night was perfect. Our waitress was great - relaxed yet friendly & professional.  Prices were high, but worth it for the food & service. For us, it will be a place for special occasions."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Sanctuary for our anniversary weekend. Elements came highly recommended, but we had a lot of restaurants that we wanted to try, so had to go to Elements for lunch. The restaurant is beautiful with a fabulous view of the Valley. We had a window seat to take advantage of the view. Our server was prompt, friendly and attentive.   The food was unfortunately a huge disappointment. We started with the grilled pear and brie quesadilla. The pears were not grilled (were barely even cooked). The brie was good, but the overall combination lacked much flavor or pizazz. The honey and pine nut garnish were the only real source of flavor and made it tolerable.   We shared the \"specialty\" Asian grilled chicken breast with grilled corn and cilantro slaw and the Angus burger with cheddar and balsamic roasted onions w/potato chips. The chicken specialty was an unseasoned cooked chicken breast with cold barbeque sauce poured on top and then cut into slices. I can't even remember having such a bland, uninspiring chicken dish. Trader Joe's frozen teriyaki chicken breasts are far superior. The grilled corn was actually grilled and was sweet and delicious. The cilantro slaw was some cabbage with shredded carrots and a few springs of cilantro, but no dressing or seasoning to bring it together.   The Angus burger was a good burger. Balsamic roasted onions were delicious. Potato chips were not anything special.   We also had breakfast from Elements via room service. Another disappointment. Average scrambled eggs. Fruit plate with limp, unripe cantaloupe and honeydew. Good latte.   Overall, I am glad that we chose to go elsewhere for our anniversary dinner. We may go back to the Sanctuary, but not to Elements."}
{"text":"The thing about reviews on a 1-to-5-star scale is that you can't be as precise as you want to be or call out specific aspects of the restaurant experience (service, food, ambience, clientele, etc.) that are truly deserving of a higher or lower rating. All you can really do is go on an overall impression that is made higher or lower depending on which of these factors matter more or less to you personally. Me - I'm all about the food and drink. Things like excellent service or a great setting can push me up that extra notch, but they won't be determinative unless they're truly specactular. Elements was a dining experience that had some of these truly spectacular qualities and therefore made my rating much higher than it would have been if I were just considering the food and drink.   My husband and I went on Memorial Day for our two-year wedding anniversary; we had reserved in advance using OpenTable.com and I put that it was our anniversary and requested a \"table with a view\" in the special requests section. This worked out quite well, since we were immediately seated at a \"lower booth\" down by the huge picture windows even though we arrived 15 minutes early. The booth was super-private and had the most unobstructed view in the restaurant. Our server was very professional and attentive - he made sure to space our courses out, to not open our bottle of prosecco until we had finished our cocktails, and to refill water and check in often but not too often. The drinks were quite expensive - we both got a signature cocktail at $15 - but fairly unique. Mine featured a snap-pea vodka (interesting!), and my husband got something with some special gin. They were definitely enjoyable, although not blow-your-mind in a $15-a-pop kind of way. The prosecco was also decent and the only really reasonably-priced item we had at $28 for a bottle.   We started the meal with the Tuna Tartare and the spanish-inspired quail with chorizo. The Tuna Tartare was good but nothing spectular - the fish was certainly fresh, but none of the flavors of the avocado or cucumber mound it topped stood out or really complemented the fish and at $20 for the plate, I could have gotten two plates of the same dish for the same price at a different restaurant. For my entree, I had the special, which was black cod on top of potato cake with a single clam on top. It was priced around $35. My husband had the niraigi (sp?), which is actually striped marlin, which came with a cucumber salad and jasmine rice. It was also around $35. Both fishes were fresh, and the sides were flavorful enough, but neither dish stood out or was particularly outstanding.   That being said, however, being there in a private booth with the most beautiful desert view in the city, we truly felt that we would have been hard-pressed to celebrate our special occasion in a more special way - even if the food were better. The view and service were just that good. If you want romance and a great dining experience on a special occasion, go to Elements. If you want to simply check out the resort (Sanctuary) and see the view but not spend a ton of money, go to Jade Bar (attached to the restaurant but in a separate room)."}
{"text":"We ate here for our 1 year anniversary on a recommendation from my sister-in-law. All in all it was great, the view was by far the best part. But honestly, I felt it was a little overhyped. The food and service were good just not that exciting.  A great place to take out of towners for a view of the valley or if you want a good meal, but if you are looking for something exquisite there are some better places to wing into."}
{"text":"I have been here quite a few times, nice place. Great views, above average food, above average service, great valet parking. Great views."}
{"text":"I love it. On our visit, the remodel wasn't quite done, but you couldn't see anything from inside the restaurant and thye had just rolled out a new menu that had a lot of really interesting looking options.   We sat in one of the booths down by the window and had a great view of the valley and the mountains below us. Our server was freakin awesome and brought us these little bread things with some sort of hummus, it was great. I ordered the short rib ravioli and ended up practically licking my plate clean. There could have been a bigger portion, but if I had ordered an appetizer or salad like I should, it would have been a perfectly sized meal.   When they get the patio opened up and the private dining room they have pictures of by the door, this will be a seriously legit contender in the valley dining scene. I'd say they are easily top 10 for overall experience right now anyway."}
{"text":"Chef Beau McMillian is one amazing chef! He left me with one of the most memorable dining experiences I have ever had. The lobster bisque was fantastic! The seafood platter had the biggest shrimp I have ever seen. and the peanut butter chocolate dessert was sooooo glorious! Not much more I can say but wow! fantastic food and and great service I can't wait to go back:-)"}
{"text":"Wonderful service and great food! First time experiencing this restaurant and it was fabulous!"}
{"text":"Just a beautiful room, great view--a nice place to be. Professional, attentive service, though bordering a bit on pretentious. So what's the problem? The food!  It must take years of practice to make an omelet that has the appearance and taste of the kind of egg-like creation that a Starbucks (etc.) sticks in a microwave for their breakfast sandwiches. The Ranchero Omelet was spongy, blah and just weird. Unlike any I've ever had, not in a good way.   We also had a farm stand veggie wrap-thing that really wasn't like what was described. So heavy on quinoa content, it overwhelmed everything else.   The Bloody Mary got a \"D\" grade from our expert, too mush horseradish, not enough of everything else.  The cinnamon rolls they brought as a dessert were the highlight, those were up with Ann Sather in Chicago for the best ever.  The experience would have been three star, except for the bathroom. Why would a classy place like this fill their urinals with ice? These were the type that went all the way to the floor, so splatter was inevitable. It's Arizona, people wear sandles, etc. Pee on the floor = bad bad bad!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the lunch that my and I had here the other day. Since it was a week day, there was barely anyone in the restaurant. We both ordered the shrimp salad. It was really delicious- the shrimp was not overly seasoned and it was grilled to perfection. The greens in the salad was remarkably fresh. Above all else the service was excellent. I think one of the reasons we really love this place is that it is tucked away and it's in a resort. So everything is on the higher end and everything is immaculate. Looking forward to coming back for lunch, dinner and staying at the resort."}
{"text":"The food was superb and the service was excellent. Had lunch on a nice clear day and the view was impressive. Ordered the Kale Caesar and the turkey burger, both were really well prepared. Beer selection was pretty solid as well, all though I'm guessing most people will opt towards the expansive wine list."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner last night at elements. My girlfriend and I shared two appetizers, the pot stickers and calamari then also shared some short ribs and the sticky rice. Everything was cooked well and has good flavor and balance. Short ribs fell apart and melted in the mouth. Very enjoyable experience and would recommend for any special occasion."}
{"text":"Went to Elements for dinner with my husband and another couple who were visiting from out-of-town. When the reservation was made and again when it was confirmed, we told Donald that we needed to have a table with a peaceful almosphere and a nice view. We arrived early and were sent to the bar although the restaurant was mostly empty. \"Great\", I thought expecting that we were indeed getting a nice table. At the time of the appointment, we were sat right next to a large round table of about nine customers, all drinking, talking and laughing loud, while the rest of the restaurant was empty!!  We requested to be moved and the waittress  did. The dinner turned out to be HORRIBLE!! Three of us ordered sea bass (approx. $45) .  The sea bass was dry and felt and tasted like straw. I did not want to disrupt the dinner again so I ate a small portion and left the rest. The waiter was mostly AwOL  This was a serious disappointment. We entertain often but wet will never return to elements nor will we recommend it.  What is going on with this restaurant? It has gone DOWNHILL! Is there a new chef, an incompetent manager? Or are they going broke? I will not be surprised if Elements closes. It used to be a fairly good restaurant. Last night it failed on all counts."}
{"text":"3/31 1530-2000  If you are going to spend this amount of money go to Kai. Different Point of View is even slightly better than elements. I think this restaurant tries to mimic a high end restaurant but flounders. The servers although kind were reading off a card and their clothes wrinkled. NORMALLY this is stupid to complain about but for a place that boasts of its ambience and asks you to pay the price you can't have things like that. From the valet barely able to look you in the eye and the ability to wish you a good evening to serving staff saying thank you I don't believe this place is good.   The food is descent. My bacon wrapped beef was good but for 55 bucks 6 oz of steak is not appropriate even if you toss 3 asparagus and a goat cheese filled hot pocket inside.   Overall, if your looking for something similar with better service and price go to Different Point of View and if your willing to spend a little more and be treated to a food presentation with personalized service go to Kai"}
{"text":"This place is simply amazing!! No kidding, I think I had the best meal of my life here. My boyfriend and I came here on our anniversary for drinks and dinner. We had a reservation, but got there a little early to enjoy drinks and live music in the Jade Bar (review coming soon). Promptly at 8:30, we were seated for dinner. Our waiter was super cool, forgot his name, but I do remember his warm personality.  We bonded because we all from the East Coast.   Our food came out so fast! Although the food was pricey, it was worth every penny. I had Chilean Sea Bass over forbidden rice and the Farmers Market salad.  The salad had watermelon radishes, Japanese cucumber,  pickled carrots and a ginger vinaigrette.  So good. He had Filet mignon and according to him it was the best steak of ever.   After dinner, our waiter graced us with complimentary homemade cookies.  They were a chocolate ginger combination. ...I wanted to die from the decadence. ...loved everything about it. The total bill was approx $120, but it was well worth it! Will Def be back, birthday is coming soon....mmmmm???"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for our first anniversary and it was the best dining experience we both have ever had. We had a private booth with a view of the sunset over the mountains. Gary, our waiter, was an amazing interpersonal man and helped us out so much with choosing what to eat. He knew exactly what was in every meal down to the very accents! Gari always made sure she kept our glasses of water full and always made sure our table was clean. Rachel was kind enough to take pictures of us at our table and all the staff was just overall awesome! The food was absolutely phenomenal in both taste and representation. The fiery calamari was an amazing starter, the pork chop and the special, which was filet minion, both came out exquisite. Compliments to the chef because he did an outstanding job. The Smores and Peanut Butter Bomb for dessert had an amazing presentation as well and turned out amazing. Overall amazing food and service!!"}
{"text":"Like a machine, the staff at Elements has the food delivery and service running smoothly."}
{"text":"We love it here! We have been here every time we come to Phoenix! You can't beat the views, service and the food!  The drinks are great as well.  They have nice outdoor sitting on the patio with heat lamps, fire as well as indoor sitting.  The indoor sitting all have great views as well!  Make a reservation- if you can go see the sunset here.    On our last visit we split the following- ahi tuna tartar, jalapeño  sashimi, fiery calamari, mac and cheese and steak.  For desert we had the peanut butter dessert- tasted like a Reese's piece! Yum...  If you come early- you can head to the jade bar which connects to the restaurant.     We can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"On this trip, I wanted to experience a well known chef, and since we were not too far away, thought we try Chef Beau MacMillan's place.  I was a little taken back by the fact the only place to self park was on the other side of the resort.  The restaurant was very nice, great view of the mountains and sunset.  Wicker chairs?  The staff was pleasant, the menu simple, with an Asian infusion.  A bit pricey, but we were willing to indulge in the experience.  We had the lobster pot sticker, it was fresh and earthy with the right amount of ginger in the dipping sauce, love the pea shoots.  My wife had the short rib, it was a very adequate serving, great flavor.  I had the pork chop, best chop I've had in terms of flavor, and in the preparation.  Over experience was fine, but not refined.  Would go back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"We have been to Elements twice in the last 3 months. BOTH times it was Excellent!  Great Views and great for Special occasions.   Try the Swordfish or the Scallops, but the Filet Mignon for the meat eaters.  Specialty are not only tasty, but they are not stingy on the alcohol.   Lastly the deserts are a special Treat. Their 'signature' desert is the Chocolate Peanut Butter Bomb, but last time we also had a Salted Caramel Cheesecake, with a Sesame Seed wafer, topped with Bacon Gelato!"}
{"text":"Located within The Sanctuary on Camelback Mountain, a Small Luxury Hotel member, elements restaurant seems to be the focal point of the resort.  Manning the kitchen is celebrity chef, Beau MacMillan, whose cuisine has a distinctive Japanese touch.  The restaurant itself overlooks the valley with great views of Camelback Mountain at sunset.  The charred edamame is a huge serving with Asian flavors, including sesame oil, black sesame seeds, and togarashi.  The lime juice adds a nice citrus zing.  The grilled chicken is cooked perfectly as it remains tender and juicy.  The pickled cucumber salad, acts as a palate cleanser with an acidic and sweet taste.  Along with the bok choy and red onions, the cucumber adds a nice textural contrast.  The fire roasted shrimp are big and plump.  They remain tender since they aren't over cooked.  The pork fried rice adds a nice richness, while the bok choy adds a nice crunch.  The sweet chile adds depth of flavor without being cloyingly sweet.  The braised short ribs are super tender, and fall apart with just the slightest nudge from your fork.  They have a nice crust but is not dry in the middle.  The bacon and brussel sprouts add a nice earthy contrast to the Korean BBQ sauce.  The crème brulee is a classic is not a firm custard, but silky smooth.  The burnt sugar adds a texture contrast to the vanilla custard.  The pineapple and raspberries are a nice palate cleanser.  The \"PB Bomb\" is supposed to be a take on the Reese's peanut butter cup, but while eating it reminded me of the classic candy bar, \"whatchamacallit\".  This is a rich dessert, but totally worth the calories.  Although Elements Restaurant at The Sanctuary is slightly off the main drag of Scottsdale Road, it's definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"We decided to try Elements out for brunch since my fiancé's parents were visiting from Ohio... I had read and heard some great things about the restaurant and the view. Expecting it to be busy, I was happy to find that there was ample seating outside available that overlooked the pool, grounds, and mountains.  All of the staff was very pleasant and courteous. Upon receiving our drinks and appetizers, we were delighted to be served fresh complimentary (and warm) cinnamon rolls! So yummy!  My huge drawback and what ruined what was otherwise a very pleasant brunch, was the extreme lull from the time we had our first drink and put in our food order, to the time our food arrived. We had to have waited 45+ minutes and during that time, were not offered a refill of the specialty drinks ordered or an explanation as to what was taking so long.   Our food was great, I ordered the breakfast veggie wrap with fingerling potatoes. We also ordered an Ole Bay Jumbo Shrimp app that was tasty, though tad bit overdone with the seasoning.. Some of the pieces of shrimp were almost entirely coated in ole bay.  Id be interested in coming back eventually but would rather try out a few other upscale brunch spots before returning."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant, but don't go on a holiday! I brought my family there for Easter. Waited 20 minutes until anyone even greeted our table. Waited another 10 for our drinks. They brought out our appetizers with our entrees because they forgot about the appetizers. It was then that we ordered a 2nd round of mimosas. They took another 20 minutes to get those. They gave us those mimosas for free, which was nice. However I expect a lot more from a restaurant like this. The food is good, but when I go to a place like this I am mostly paying for an experience and a standard that I expect to be upheld. I felt like our table was shoved in the corner and forgotten about. I was shocked! I expected better."}
{"text":"Healthy Gourmet Food in the prettiest setting in all of AZ. Chef Beau is the best! Expensive but worth it for the WHOLE EXPERIENCE!"}
{"text":"We headed here for brunch on New Years. The location is amazing in Paradise Valley and tucked away. Valet was very friendly and welcoming.  Atmosphere - If you haven't been to Sanctuary the style is somewhat modern with a zen feeling to it with some amazing outdoor views. We sat inside facing the mountains. Booths are set up to be very private though next to each other (the seats act as dividing walls as well, though it is not sound proof. The view is beautiful and the setting of the table is such that you can sit right next to each other if you prefer.  Food - I ordered the egg white frittata and the toasted coconut waffle out of indecision. As well as green tea and orange juice to drink.   The toasted coconut waffle was delicious. I highly recommend. It was sweet, but not too sweet. The whip cream was unique and light. I loved the shreds of coconut and strawberries. It had a fresh tart taste mixed with the creamy whip cream and I believe honey even. The waffles themselves tasted great as well. Crisp and fresh.  The egg white frittata was very healthy. I am a fan of goat cheese and purple potatoes which were part of this entree. It was definitely a much healthier option. It was a bit dry yet full flavored with what I believe were onions and broccoli.   Service - our waitress Ingrid was very pleasant and offered us a cinnamon bun pastry. They were delicious. It was a fantastic surprise edition to our meal. She came by often to check in on us, but not too much, and brought our bill promptly.   Definitely a place to be for more of a resort feel or special occasion. Pricing is in line with the experience. I recommend."}
{"text":"Some of the best food I've had in Arizona. Portions were not bad and prices were alright but definitely high. View more than made up for it."}
{"text":"I think it's been summed up pretty thoroughly by others, so I'll just list a few of my favorite things.  Bare wood ceiling Beautiful views of the mountains No bad seat in the place Fire pit with little swirlies drawn in the dark sand Salt and fresh cracked black pepper in a cute yin-yang bowl Great food and even better service FREE BIRF-DAY DESSERT in the form of molten chocolate...... (they even wrote 'happy birthday' in chocolate on the plate.  Sweet!)  The only thing I could pick at is...for such a beautiful and chic place to go, did they really have to put fake horsetail in the vases at each table?  Come on now, couldn't you splurge on the real stuff?  Best lunch item:  Orecchiette pasta with shrimp, chicken, and sausage in a morrocan spice cream sauce."}
{"text":"Went tonight for Father's Day dinner , was greeted by a very friendly staff and ambiance . Had the dumpling and oyster appetizer was amazing.for entree had the Chilean sea bass and honestly the best I have ever had !! My wife had the chicken very good ! Amazing dinner and service highly recommended !!!"}
{"text":"If you want a restaurant with an amazing view and delicious food stop in here especially at sunset. Staff is friendly and ambience was nice. We love the hummus and salads."}
{"text":". This place is simply fantastic. Its beautiful inside and out. The food is just as beautiful as the scenery. service was excellent from the start and they even had a car ready to take us home when we were done since we showed up in a cab.   The menu changes which means i will be back to experience some more 5-star cuisine. Go here, you will love it.   Very romantic"}
{"text":"We were in town for a bachelorette party and were recommended Elements by a local as the best place to catch the sunset. He mentioned that they have live music but it is first come, first serve. We got suuuuper lucky and were able to get a table to accommodate 8 girls.   The food was incredible! The firey calamari was amazing and the pork buns were so delicious. Live music was fun and upbeat. The service was great and it really was the most incredible spot to watch the sunset. The manager stopped by our table a few times to make sure everything was up to par and we had no complaints. I can't wait to come back to Scottsdale and visit Elements again."}
{"text":"Work allows me to travel here and there which is nice.  I went to Phoenix last week for a client meeting and we took them to Elements at  the Sanctuary Resort & Spa.  Besides the fact that it was about 104 degrees at noon (I had like behind the knee sweat, gross!) this spot was so good.  Of course they win points for serving their delicious & refreshing moscow mules in copper cups - the way they should be!  We had a drink and the sesame hummus in the Jade bar while we waited for our table which was served w/ warm pita and crudite.  It was good, but nothing to write home about.  We sat at a table in the middle of the restaurant, but we still had a great view of the desert mountains and a gorgeous sunset.  I had the roasted corn bisque (with black truffle & lobster fritter) which was one of the best bisques I've ever had.  I was  hesitant to get it since it's so hot there, but they know how to crank up the AC in Phoenix!  I got to try a taste of the truffled mac & cheese (with fresh umbria truffles) and if I was more of a mac & cheese person I would've eaten that up like it was my job.  Seriously, truffles just make everything better.  For dinner I had the Seared Jumbo Sea Scallops, but asked them to serve it with the roasted shiitake mushrooms, asparagus, artichokes, meyer lemon broth that is served w/ the roasted chicken.  The scallops were done very well, but the accompanying vegetables were overcooked and too salty for me.  For dessert the other 5 ladies and I decided to order their passion (goat cheese cheesecake with lemon zest drizzled with passionfruit, lychee compote & guava coulis) to share.  It was muy interesante.  Good, but not something that you'd want to eat the entire thing or fight other people's attacking spoons for a bigger share.  But it's not bad - it's just different.  One person compared it to those whipped yogurts in terms of consistency.  You first taste it and it tastes tart like normal cheesecake, but then you get an aftertaste of goat cheese.  It looked nice though! http://notomatoesplease.wordpress.com/2010/06/28/elements-phoenix-az/"}
{"text":"Beautiful place to mingle with friends. The service is fast, friendly, and accommodating. Desert peanut butter amazing, however if I ordered a filet rare, I expect it rare not medium rare to medium like most at the dinner party ordered. Even though there were 25 of us we should get our food prepared as asked, not what is convenient for the kitchen."}
{"text":"Such a great experience   I had a moo shoo appetizer with leeks and trumpet mushrooms . I had the brisket and truffled macaroni and cheese .My companion had lobster soup which he loved .He also had an entree which he loved . The dessert was so yummy with whoppers ,chocolate. I forgot the name of the dessert .Thanks for the great service and wine."}
{"text":"Service could have been better. How hard is it to poor a beer or muddle some mint?  It was a Wed night and a friend and I went to dinner prior (Capital Grille at Biltmore) where we had amazing service.  We went to Elements to have a drink afterwards in the bar (not the restaurant service -- bar only). I thought since he was from out a town the scenery and atmosphere would be nice.  However, Elements wasn't top notch with their service.  No one greeted us promptly and no one took the time to make our drinks promptly, either. We could see the bar directly in front of us (with no barrier between our bistro table and the bartender) and they weren't busy...just slow.  I would go back - but I wouldn't expect any better service from the bar."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Gosh. Where do I even begin?   My boyfriend brought me here last night for a dinner out and our experience by far exceeded our expectations. Our server was Michael and he was amazing. Very knowledgable about the menu, friendly, and quick.   I had a dirty martini that was made perfectly. We started with the rock shrimp and crab dumplings. Delicious. Then I ordered the Filet of Beef, and he ordered the pork chop. They were both out of this world. We took our first bites and looked at each other in amazement lol. The steak was cooked perfectly medium rare. I'm from Nebraska and it was by far the best steak I've ever had. We finished every bite.   Portions are a good size too. I feel like at most upscale restaurants you get small portions, but not here.   We were so full but were afraid to miss out on dessert so we ordered the Smores. It was just as delicious as everything else and we finished every last bite.   The view is amazing from the bottom booth we sat in and we were there right at sunset.   I highly recommend Elements. We have been talking about our dinner all day today, and we can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I made reservations via opentable the morning before we dined. Easy and we were seated immediately upon arrival.  Service was a bit slow. We didn't feel any connection from either the server or the server assistant. The bread service was below basic, especially for a fine dining restaurant. We asked the server for his favorite and most popular cocktails. We ordered both: sisos sexy and another that I do not know the name of. He wasn't present on the floor as much as I'd hoped.   My friend ordered the bacon wrapped filet and thought it was delicious. It was one of her favorite filets in all time. I ordered the organic salmon which was delicious as well. The sauce on both the dishes really made up the entrees. The salmon came with noodles and vegetables that really complimented the salmon. Two entrees that you cannot go wrong with.  Our reservation was at 6:15pm and we sat to see the sunset. It was gorgeous. Definitely come around this time to see the sun set.   Lastly, compliments to the maitre d' or manager who made his table touches and really looked like he was enjoying each conversation with the guests. He complimented us on our smiles and we told him we came out to see one of the top 39 restaurants with a view in the world. He said they must be doing something right.   I would say this wasn't my favorite fine dining restaurants but it definitely is something to cross off my bucket list. Good for special occasions."}
{"text":"The Elements nourishes your body and mind.  It is a very beautiful restaurant located on the grounds of the Sanctuary Resort, which is carved in Camelback mountain.  There l attended a private event and it was my first bite at the Elements. We had a special menu crafted for our group. We started with a cocktail reception. Open bar, display of cruditees, domestic and international cheeses, sourdough bread, charcuterie and fruits.  Dinner consisted of a Tomato soup, Pomona chicken or Hoisin short ribs, salad, rosemary apple tart.  Just being there was amazing, the views are unbelievable, breathtaking. We received Top notch food and service.  The soup, ie, bisque gave us an explosion of rich flavors. It had pepites of bacon and a lace of creme fraiche. Rich savors of tomato reduction and herb, a hint of a unique balsamic vinegar was out of this world.  We all wanted more of it! The Pomona chicken is specially raised in Pomona, CA for the restaurant. Interesting combo of the rosemary and apple tart concluded our culinary experience.  It gave us one last Element on our dinner plate no one expected and we all embraced it."}
{"text":"I need to revise a review I posted on Tuesday about this restaurant.  After our subpar experience on Valentine's Day we were contacted by the Food and Beverage director.  He invited us back to ensure us that our experience was not typical.  We returned and had a perfect evening!  The food, wine and service were impeccable!  It is a truly fabulous restaurant!  Thank you, Justin!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that Elements pretty much set the bar for a special occasion destination. This place really bends over backwards for your special occasion, and that has not gone unnoticed. Elements is located on Camelback mountain, has a gorgeous view (especially at sunset), and is headed by chef Beau MacMillan (of food network fame). When we arrived, we decided to self park, which is actually quite a trek up to the restaurant in the maze that was the Sanctuary hotel, but it was pretty and we didn't mind the walk. We were greeted upon arrival and they promptly said 'happy anniversary!' (I had noted it in the res). We were shown to our table, which was facing a full wall window and was covered in rose petals... nice touch guys! Our waiter was attentive, but a little odd... I can't put my finger on it, but he seemed a little too 'put on,' this was not a big deal though.  I decided to start with a cocktail and was swayed to try the honeydew/ cucumber/gin concoction by the waiter, describing it as a sweet drink. Well... this drink was basically gin over ice.... it wasn't fabulous, but it was decent, and had enough gin in it to warrant the 14$ price tag.   We ordered the lobster bisque to share to start. They brought the soup in two bowls for us... very nice. The soup was good, but not great. The lobster was a bit cold and the bisque was made with coconut milk.... which was interesting, but didn't have the richness of a traditional bisque. The bread they serve, however, is delicious... crusty, flavorful, and warm, served with salted butter... yum.   For entrees I had the bacon wrapped filet which came with some polenta, onion, and mushrooms (45$), the husband had the prime new york strip which came with a bunch of braised greens (and bacon) and was topped with a huge roasted parsnip (48$), and we split the truffle mac and cheese side (which was super expensive at 17$). My filet was tasty, but the bacon wrapping seemed unnecessary. The filet itself was delicious and the mushrooms were nice and tender. The husband's steak was decidedly better, very juicy and flavorful. The parsnip was very good, but the star was the sauce and greens.... they were perfectly savory, well seasoned, and complemented the meat. The mac and cheese was good... but maybe not as good as it was expensive (I will say though that I had most of it for lunch the next day as leftovers mixed with the greens from the husband's steak and the bacon... it was really good like this).   The restaurant was nice enough to bring us dessert on the house and decorate the plate with chocolate saying ' happy anniversary' ... Like I said... they went all out. The dessert was a lemon tart with gelato and fried herbs... it was pretty delicious.   Take home point: I would come back here, but only for very special occasions (this place is pretty crazy expensive). The food was very good, but maybe not as good as it was pricey."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night with girlfriends in January. The place was very quiet and it kind of brought us down. The food looked and tasted wonderful. I wasn't very hungry; otherwise I would have eaten much more. I'd like to try it again when the room is more energetic and I have an appetite."}
{"text":"Wonderful ambiance and excellent food.  I had the short rib - delicious. Can't wait to go back, again."}
{"text":"This place has a wonderful view of Camelback Mountain!  I ordered the  Farmstead Veggie Omelette. It was really good but I could  have omitted the quinoa it did nothing for the flavor! The potatoes were crispy and very tasty  Taylor was our waiter and he did a great job as a brand new employee!"}
{"text":"This is a terrific restaurant for a special occasion. The food is beautiful, fresh, and delicious. Views of Camelback are stunning. Staff is knowledgeable, professional, and friendly -- not a touch of the stuffiness that you find in some of their peers. I've been here three times and never had a bad experience or a less than stellar dish."}
{"text":"I would love to give 5 stars, however the valet was atrocious. I've met strangers that were nicer. Our taxi was having issues processing the transaction, and the valet guys did everything they could to dramatize the situation (which was about five minutes long at eight o clock). There are two lanes so we were not blocking traffic, but one valet felt the need to yell \"Jesus Christ Asshole\" in front of a family of four children under the age of 10. I've never had worse or embarrassing service. Definitely was not a great way to start out an expensive meal. They must have known with a cab that they weren't receiving a tip, I guess.   On the other hand the food and views are absolutely five stars. I would love to dine there again. I think these are some of the best views in Arizona!"}
{"text":"So this place is all about the view. The food, however has always had an issue. The tuna was overcooked etc... never that \" nailed it\" moment, which for the price, is something you are looking to Achieve. Menus could use a touch more creativity."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful sunset birthday dinner. They served only the best farm-fresh-to-table ingredients. Everything was very seasonal (heirloom tomatoes, melon, beets). I had sashimi grade nairagi with mango kimchi. It was excellent, all of my favorite flavors in one dish! The lemongrass lychee semifreddo was fantastic as well. Excellent atmosphere, service, and food. I will be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant was absolutely amazing.  My husband and I came here for dinner while on a weekend trip.  The hostess who sat us was very professional and our server was great.  She knew just when to see if we needed anything or to leave us alone.  Our table overlooked the mountains and it was perfect for sunset.  We got the crab and lobster fondue for an appetizer and it melted in your mouth.  The crab was awesome!  My husband got pork tenderloin for dinner and he loved it!  He got it cooked medium and it was perfect, not dry at all.  I got the bacon wrapped filet and it was great!  The steak was cooked perfectly.  Even the drinks were good!  There only bad thing to say is we sat in the jade bar at a table for 10 minutes and the cocktail waitress kept walking by and never stopped to take our order."}
{"text":"The scene was absolutely lovely. Tall floor-to-ceiling windows, low lighting, a waiter willing to change up our shaky table, live jazz....I need not go on about the ambiance as it was wonderful. It was a little chilly in the restaurant, but a gentleman's jacket always does the trick.  On to the edibles: the wine selection is terrific and we both ended up with extremely fragrant reds that fit the mood perfectly. We started with the firecracker calamari - I don't care if you don't like seafood, order it. The sauce was unlike any sauce I've had with calamari and I would have eaten it by the spoonful if my lady-like conscience hadn't kicked in. I was so torn with the meatless fare because the options were so nice, but finally decided on the eggplant rolls. They however were extremely disappointing. For a place this pricey and exquisite on all levels, I would have expected perfectly cooked eggplant. But the under cooked aubergine was way too chewy and the sweet and sour sauce underwhelming. I anticipated a sauce as delicious as the appetizer, but instead got something that looked like it could easily have come from a bottle. Not impressed, but my significant other loved the short ribs.  Overall, the service, wine and setting were beautiful and I would return to try other vegetarian options, but that eggplant needs some work. Or it needs to come off the menu. Or I need to have a few more glasses of wine to care less."}
{"text":"I took my man here as a surprise for his 30th birthday. We got there pretty early and had a cocktail at the bar, and then another cocktail outside on their chick modern outdoor furniture. The bartender was one of the best we've had and recommended one of their speciality martinis. I tried a couple, and their citrus one was to die for. It was seriously the best drink I've had.   I made a reservation for sunset and scored one of the best views in the restaurant. Do yourself a favor and ask for a table right along the window so you have a great unobstructed view of the sunset. The views were the the most beautiful I've seen in the Valley. It was 180+ degrees of pure beauty.   I thought the dinner was fantastic, our service was good, and the ambiance made it worth the money. It's really pricey though, and while the food is great, it didn't blow me completely out of the water. It was by no means average, don't get me wrong, just not super-extremely-fantastic for how much it costs. I'd definitely go back for a special occasion!!"}
{"text":"5 Stars for Atmosphere and Service. The food is good but view is amazing. My husband and I shared the beef carpaccio, thinly sliced raw beef, very tender with a light dressing. We also shared the hoisin braised short ribs, their signature dish, and it also was good on the sweeter side I didn't really notice the wasabi. The forbidden rice was very different, not really like rice but tasty. Our rind ordered the tuna tartare which they enjoyed along with he lobster carbonara I tasted it and it also was on the sweet side a heavy dish but did have a nice amount of chopped up lobster. For dessert we opted for the roasted apple tart which was okay, t was flaky but just not worth the calories. Ron our server was wonderful, friendly, attentive and he didn't hover. It is a little more on the pricey side but is definitely a romantic setting. It would be great to make a good impression on a date or for an anniversary."}
{"text":"I just love elements.  I loved it when the Sanctuary opened up and even though I've moved away, I keep coming back for the views and the vibe.  Perhaps, it also holds a special place in my heart after my surprise 30th birthday party here.    We went for a birthday lunch on a quiet weekday and it was lovely.  Serene and relaxing.  The food was light and spa-like and perfectly tasty.  If food can taste like a place feels, that's what it's like here.  I always leave elements feeling like a better person."}
{"text":"Can't say a single bad thing about this place.   Service - 5 stars -Showed up for our reservations and asked if it was possible to sit outside, they accommodated without any issues. Water was served right after we sat and the waitress which was extremely nice took over from there. She gave some great recommendations and was very pleasant the entire evening!  Atmosphere - 5 stars - the entire resort has a great vibe and the restaurant is no different. All of the employees were very nice, the outdoor seating over looks the pool area which is perfect to catch one of those beautiful sunsets.   Food - 5 stars - Every single dish was just as good if not better then expected, I had the duck which was cooked to perfection and my wife had the halibut special that night which was about as perfect of a piece of fish that one could ask for. Cooked to perfection!  Value - 5 stars - while this place is not cheap by any means, came out to 100 dollars per a person, you can't expect to pay much less then this for a dinner at a 5 star resort that has an iron chef cooking in the kitchen. Coming from SF this seems like a reasonable value for a high end restaurant.   Overall I highly recommend this place to anyone who is living or visiting the area, two thumbs up. I will definitely be back next time I am in scottsdale!"}
{"text":"It doesn't matter how many years go by this place is still by far one of the best places in town... amazing views, superb service and Best of All... \"The delicious food\"."}
{"text":"Very enjoyable anniversary dinner.  We were given private booth at the front of the restaurant, with panoramic view of the valley.  My wife and I had swordfish and short rib, both of which were excellent.  Service was attentive but not rushed at all. Jade Bar next door was also a fun spot.  Would happily recommend elements for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Hostess service was very poor the night we went, waited over an hour past our reservation time to be seated. A mediocre dessert was complimentary for our wait. The bar had a decent selection of cocktails, but smelled of stale cleaning water. However, the entrees and appetizers were as good as it gets for this price range. The asian fusion of traditional calamari was excellent. But their special of Rib eye with hollandaise and shrimp was out of this world delicious. Very romantic setting with one of the best views in the valley. Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"This lovely restaurant from executive chef Beau MacMillan is set inside the Sanctuary Resort between on the north side of Camelback Mountain. The resort looks gorgeous and might make a lovely overnight getaway or honemoon retreat. We live in the area, so we were here to celebrate a birthday dinner. The little bar (Jade) has friendly service and super-high top tables. I did have trouble climing up and down in a short dress. Our martinis were excellent - I had the 11th Generation Martini with gin, raspberry, peach tea, and honey; and hubby had the Blood Orange Basil with grey goose. They were both tasty, but his was better. We shared the spiced edamame and they came with quite a kick. Tasty, salty, and spicy. Our table was a lovely little booth for two and as the sun set, it made for quite a spectacular view overlooking the resort and valley towards the north. My dinner choice was the double cut pork chop with sweet potatoes. The maple glaze on the chop was quite good, but it was a bit tough through the interior. The sweet potatoes were way too salty. Soft, flavorful, but even my salt-lovin' hubby said it was too much. He had the chilean sea bass which was perfect. Flaky white fish in a great broth with bok choy. We shared the pork-belly fried rice which was a true hit. Birthday desert with a candle was their signature peanut butter chocolate bomb. The peanut butter creme was a luscious delight covered with a rich chocolate shell. Service was pretty good considering their was only one server in our entire area. There were two assistants helping her out, but we felt a bit neglected at times for water refills, etc. All around, a good meal. Pricy, spicy, but good. Oh, and make reservations!"}
{"text":"Came here about a month ago while on vacation. My new AZ friend and her husband are regulars and she wanted me to see the view of the Sanctuary. Well let me tell it's spectacular! We walked around taking pics then we ate here. I'm pretty sure it was happy hour. My friend ordered the lobster mac n cheese and I ordered the mussels.  The lobster mac n cheese is not your typical mac n cheese. It's made with cavatelli and fontina cheese but it was superb! So I am very critical about mussels but I have to admit they were pleasant to my taste buds as music is to ones ears!  I would not only come back to the restaurant but would love to stay here. I've never felt so peaceful."}
{"text":"Amazing views at this place and very friendly staff. The food was good and very filling. We went for brunch and even at dinner time I was still full."}
{"text":"We were looking for someplace to have dinner on our 37th anniversary.  The date fell on a Wednesday so we were hoping to find a nice quiet location for a midweek celebration.   We browsed Yelp and then discovered a Groupon for elements at the Sanctuary.   It was a nice discount and the menu looked intriguing so we went for it.  We went after the hubby got home from work but a skosh late for sunset.  (A reason to go back)  We were greeted by the valet who were very pleasant and within no time we were seated at a table.  Despite the hour there was a lovely glow behind the Monk on Camelback and the surrounding lights quite nice.  We had cocktails whuch were well crafted and poured.  For starters we split a mixed greens salad with tender local produce and a subtle vinaigrette.  This came with crusty bread and herbed butter.  The hubby had the shortribs and declared them fantastic.  I had the filet which was like butter.  Both meals were a good portion of well prepared food.  Very satisfying.  However we did have dessert. The hubby loved his PB Bombe and I had the Piña Colada pastry.  Both fabulous!  We will go back for sunset for sure!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing lunch today. Construction was loud and intrusive, Thai chicken salad had way too many peanuts and wonton strips, and the chicken came cold but with the skin on. Ugh. Have had much better at CPK. Cobb salad was very good - my sister enjoyed it. What she didn't enjoy was the pit in a chocolates covered cherry that was part of a very mediocre cheesecake dessert. This is a broken tooth just waiting to happen. The straw that finally had us go to the manager was the state of the bathroom. Completely unacceptable for a highly ranked restaurant like this. Andre comped our meal which was appreciated but the whole experience still left a very bad taste. Had been there before for a great meal but felt this needed to be part of the overall review list. A good restaurant should be good during all of the hours it's open and no matter the season! Actual meal was in June 2013."}
{"text":"Went last night with friends for an annual holiday dinner. The service was first class and the location and actual resturant are very nice and elegant. Now for the food.....wow! The food was great and creatively prepared. Our party for the appetizer course had their potato leak soup, oyster Rockefeller, stuffed Asia dumplings and escargot. Our  main courses were duck, pork chop, halibut and steak. Everything was wonderful.  While not inexpensive, the meal was worth the price. Will definately return."}
{"text":"Breath taking scenic views, recommend a sunset dinner and eating outside weather permitting. Inside the views are panoramic of the city / mountains and still spectacular.   Starred out with the Fiery Calamari and Truffle Mac n' Cheese for our appetizers.   The Fiery Calamari was prepared excellent with a nice crisp batter but not to hard or soggy. It was flavored with a Thai Basil, Peppercorn and Miso Scallion Vinaigrette. A little kick but not to spicy.   The Truffle Mac n' Cheese was in a mascarpone Italian cheese made from cream with cavatelli pasta shells and beech mushrooms. Very tasty but almost ordered the soft shell crab steamed bun.  Our Main Entrée were the Bacon Wrapped Filet of Beef, Hoisin Braised Short Ribs , Kurobuta Pork Chop and the Miso Glazed Salmon.  The Bacon Wrapped Filet was prepared in a Balsamic Onion, Trumpet Mushrooms along with Blue Cheese Whipped Potatoes and wrapped in bacon. Very tender and flavorful. Awesome for the meat lover.  The Hoisen Braised Short Ribs came with Japenese Yams, Spinach and Shitake Mushrooms topped with Lotus Root. The  Meat on the ribs fell off the bone and was so tender and flavorful, I personally love the flavor of Hoisin.   The Kurobuta Pork Chop was a huge serving as it was actually 2 cuts of Pork Chops with double bones. The Pork chops were accompied with Brussel Sprouts and Bacon with an incredible 5 spice honey drizzle. I could have used an extra cup of the 5 spice honey drizzle just to dip eat slice of Pork chop. Gary our waiter told us that the Kurobuta Pork Chop is the Kobe Beef of Pork Chop. Another excellent dish.  The last entrée that we ordered was the Miso Glazed Salmon served with Soba Noodles, Ginger, Bok Choy and Shitake Mushrooms. All the flavors were excellent, moist and tender.  I loved the Asian flare that all the dishes had with many of my favorite flavors and many new asian sauces.  We ended our meal with the Salted Caramel Cheesecake which was a work of art by itself. The cheesecake had a black sesame tuile on top, with huckleberry coulis and topped with smoked bacon ice cream with a circular frozen sugar accent.   Be prepared, all parking is valet, not unless you want to take a nice little hike up the hill.  Gary was our waiter and was excellent, he met all our needs and more for dinner. Gary also presented us with 2 - Coconut Lime Cupcakes, one for our anniversay and the other for my birthday, they were like heaven.  Besides the exceptional complete meal was my highlight of the evening as Gary setup our family to meet Chef Beau Macmillan,  Chef McMillen came to our table and spoke to us and thanked us for celebrating our anniversary and birthday at his restaurant, I asked him about his chefs table dinner and he gave us his business card if we were interested in his personal chefs table meal and at the end of our meal invited our family into his kitchen where we were able to take a photo with him.  All I can say is the experience was incredible from the atmosphere, service, exceptional view to one of the best meals I have ever had to the gracious hospitality of Chef Beau Macmillan.   Can't wait to come back to try the Chef's Table.  This was one of the most, if not the most memorable meal I have ever had and if you don't go you are missing out on one of the premier restaurants in Arizona.   Thanks Chef Beau Macmillan for an exceptional meal and experience!   Definitely 5 Plus Stars!"}
{"text":"My all time favorite spot.  Best sunset in the Valley.  Steller views and decor.  Amazing martinis.  Excellent food.  I don't usually order seafood in the desert but the scallops here were amazing.  When I ate here in May I saw Mario Batali leaving!  I call this place the vortex.  It is so serene you never want to leave.    The spa/resort (the Sanctuary on Camelback) also happens to be my all-time favorite resort.  I wish I could live here.  Too bad it is sooooo expensive.  Go during off season.    The Jade Bar is one of my favorite bars.  The killer martinis are served in bucket-sized glasses and strange things are always afoot...  very entertaining."}
{"text":"Outstanding service! Delicious food! Beautiful seating areas! If you want to impress your date, I will not take them anywhere else (and make sure you bring enough money to pay the bills. It's pricy but worth it).   I was not aware of this restaurant until it is listed on the restaurant week menu. I don't normally drive more than 30 minutes from Chandler for food, but my friend repeatedly told me how outstanding their food was when they ate here last Saturday. We got lost for 10 minutes because the GPS kept telling us to turn right (when it was on the left LOL), but boy was it worth it.  We started our evening with a glass of wine, a blue cheese wedge and Shitake peppers. I was expecting the peppers to be spicy (possibly with lots of garlic)...to my surprise, it wasn't cooked that way at all. It was different than what I am used to but I am glad I tried it. For the main entrée, we had braised short ribs & mushroom Raviolis and Coffee Spice Duck Breast. I wanted it to be cooked medium rare and it was cooked exactly the way I like it (you still can see a little bit of pink right in the middle - that was beautiful). The duck meat was very tender and juicy. For desserts, we had Gelato (Vanilla and chocolate flavor) and sobie. Hmmm Hmmm hmmmm! It was so yummie.   The server was attentive while giving us lots of privacy. He NEVER interrupt our conversation like most servers do at other restaurants. My small complain about that evening was the air conditioning. We were sitting at the corner table and I was starting to sweat 20 minutes in. Other than that, the night cannot be more perfect.   I will most definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"We went on New Year's Eve to celebrate before heading out and meeting with friends. The meal was an absolute disaster. The restaurant tried to fit in as many people as possible and thus we were seated extremely close to our neighbors. It was hard to have a nice relaxing time. I've been to such dinners at other restaurants before and the seating was much more spacious.   The salads were good but for the main we got the lamb and the filet mignon (medium). The lamb was definitely good but the filet was the absolutely worst I've ever had. It tasted stale and off. In fact it was probably not even a filet. The texture was disgusting and the meat had a weird black tint on it. I did not finish it and and packed it in hopes of recooking and salvaging it the next day. However the next day, despite having refrigerated it, the discoloration in the meat was worse and it had a ridiculous stench and after taste to it. Ended up throwing it.   I would not recommend this place to anyone for a while. They need to up their game."}
