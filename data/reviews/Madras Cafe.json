{"text":"If you are looking for authentic Indian veg food, then this is the place you want. We had a huge family masala dosa, Gobi 65, paneer butter masala and pav bhaji. All was tasty and very good."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite restaurant in Charlotte.
Our all time favorites - Paratha-Kurma, Podi Dosa, Kuthu Parotta.Madras coffee is must try. Best veg restaurant around the area...
We come almost once a week. The service is very good. All folks are very friendly. One of my friend also ordered catering service from Madras cafe for his sons Birthday. That was one of the best food we had recently. They also have a party hall near Mallad Creek Rd."}
{"text":"Awesome food!! Great customer service!!
Panner tikka masala was really good. Must try mango lassli aswell."}
{"text":"Delicious South Indian cuisine with polite, friendly service.  We brought our two toddlers and, although they were equipped with high chairs and kid choices on the menu, even those had too much spice for our little ones.  My wife and I really enjoyed the flavours and I would come back if it was just the two of us."}
{"text":"My partner and I came in with a Groupon for an appetizer, two drinks, two entrees, and a dessert. We ordered the chicken 65 for our appetizer (with another appetizer - plain dosa), falooda and a sweet lassi for our drinks (included in the Groupon! very unusual), the chicken mughlai and the coconut fry for our entrees, and the gulab jamun for dessert. Everything was amazing and I'd highly recommend all of it - especially the dosa and the chicken mughlai. We informed the server of our Groupon right away and still received fantastic service - our server was kind, helpful, and quick, even when it was quite busy. We will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Place is neat and tidy. Only place that has all kinda South Indian vegetarian food. Service is good."}
{"text":"Very good food and service. A place for Southern Indian food, good selection. I will definitely return"}
{"text":"Wonderful place.. dosa is very good.. especially my favorite Rava dosa..! Service is also good.. nice ambience."}
{"text":"My fiance' and I are frequent visitors to Charlotte. We are both vegan, so anytime we travel we are on the search to find quality food. We didn't find out about Madras until recently while in town for a festival. I don't know how we overlooked Madras when we initially did our google search for vegan/vegetarian food years ago. All I can say is that we are ecstatic! We finally found GREAT, AUTHENTIC, Indian cuisine! We ordered the Schezwan rice along with their Gobi Manchurian (fried cauliflower). OMG, So delicious! Both dishes popped with flavor, the perfect heat (spicy), and they do not act skimpy with the portions. The gentleman that took our order was very helpful! I didn't know what I was ordering and my fiance' (who has been to India several times) couldn't recall what he would eat while he was there. The entire staff were very friendly- a place that is perfect for the family! We have been back twice since our initial visit. This is definitely our go to whenever in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Highly recommended if you like Indian cuisine but want something more than just the typical Chicken Tikka Masalas. 

We were on a short visit to Calgary when we stumbled upon this authentic South Indian cuisine restaurant . I tried the Mysore Masala Dosa and it had just the right amount of punch. The sambhar was really good too. The Ada Pradhaman was the best I've ever tasted in North America. 

As most other reviewers have said that the service was good, but the interiors are simple. I'm sure that with this quality of food, the restaurant will prosper and will upgrade its ambience shortly."}
{"text":"Excellent food best dosa in Calgary town and authehtic southindian dosa"}
{"text":"This place has probably the best Indian food I've ever eaten!! We stopped by while passing through Charlotte and tried the buffet- awesome decision. The staff were the nicest people ever and the food was perfectly spiced, with a huge variety of options. My boyfriend isn't even a vegetarian and he said it was the best Indian he'd ever had too. So if you want AMAZING food served by really cool people definitely stop by Madras. P.s. The mango lassi was great too!"}
{"text":"Awesome filter coffee .Nice idly ,dosa vada combo .Ambience is good .Would like to visit again"}
{"text":"Food is good and the price is right.  I like the concept.  The problem is its complete chaos from the moment you walk in and bump into folks waiting.   To the time you eventually leave, many minutes later.  Come when they open and you'll be happy"}
{"text":"Very tasty food. Takeout portions are a bit small in my opinion; however, the food is amazing. I love this place."}
{"text":"Wish i could give 0 stars! This was the first time we decided to take a to go from here and its the last time too. For the first time we got cheated with our order. We ordered 2 plates idli (they told us that each plate 3 idlis). but after we got home we saw there were only 5 idlis in the box. I am not sure how much they profited by not giving us 1 idli? 

Staff attitude is really bad too. while ordering we asked for one boc small box of chutney as they gave us 1 tiny cup only. and as we had ordered 2 plates of idli we asked for 1 more, they refused to give us, saying \"what we have given good enough quantity, we cannot give more\" not wanting to make a scene, we just left the place. 

This is the worst place ever. Be sure wht you order and what u get"}
{"text":"I am a repeat customer, I'm a vegetarian and a foodie. My obsession with dossas began when I went to India. I have tried a few other dossa/south Indian restaurants and they have either been very greasy or not flavourful enough. I live for spicy food, and the Hyderabadi dossa definitely satisfies! I go straight for that because I've been told it is the spiciest one. My wife has tired a few different ones and they have all been delicious. I always top it off with a falooda, always hits the spot!! I really wish this restaurant was presented better eg.  better location, décor, presentation..... But it's so delicious I don't mind!"}
{"text":"The spinach dosa was my fave! Soo good and it was all you can eat. I could only finish two, but will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Loved this place. The guy who took our order and served us was super friendly and helpful. The dosas were to die for. Everything we ate was great and prices are very reasonable. 
Wish we lived closer we would be here all the time."}
{"text":"Had the thaali. Was pretty bad - the veg curries looked unappealing and were tasteless. There was some really weird sweet dish made from lentils!
Only saving grace was the rasam. Not recommended."}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite for south Indian food in Charlotte. 
Rava masala dosa, Pongal, were explicit. The only disappointing thing was the deserts the first time I went. Second time the deserts were better. 
Would definitely come back again!
Keep it up Madras Cafe :)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for dosas. They have all kinds of different dosas,and their customer service is always great! I highly recommend this place,they deserve a 5/5."}
{"text":"We had the chili onion rava dosa and it was out of the world! The people here are very friendly and we had an awesome experience."}
{"text":"Nice ambience and awesome place for vegetarians.... this is our first visit here!!!! Loved the restaurant

Dishes were tasty and good 

Filter Coffee is a must try for all Coffee lovers"}
{"text":"Probably the  best south indian food (veg) you can get in North Charlotte. Service is wonderful"}
{"text":"My craving for dosa took me to this place. Me and one of my American friend came here at around 7.30. It was kind of busy. We were welcomed by a server. First impression of service forced me to give 5*. We placed order for masala dosa and chilly PANEER dosa. It was so yummy that I could not stop myself from ordering other one.. my friend enjoyed it a lot. Definitely the best tiffin place in town.. will go back.."}
{"text":"Best dosa in town! Had ghee roast and it was great. The service could be better. The waiting time was the worst part but the food made it worth waiting. Coffee was really good. The onion rava dosa was so good. Would definitely be going there often."}
{"text":"Great place to come for Southern Indian Dosas. Wonderful selection and all served with 3 different lentil dishes. I also loved the Uthappam and my husband loved his Aloo Gobi. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Food was soggy ,gross ,and disgusting . I will never go back, wouldn't recommend anyone to waste there money on this place . The food looks nothing like the picture they have posted online. The 1 star is because I ate the fries on the plate, the sandwich went in the trash."}
{"text":"I am one of those people who eat outside every couple of days. This has got to be the worst restaurant experience I have had in the longest of time I have known. The food was below average, place was dirty, water leaking from the ceiling, worst of all was the service was horrible. The place is very poorly organized. It's a total chaos. The interest they show in producing the bill is not shown in taking orders in a timely fashion or serving food in a timely fashion. I went there on a Friday evening and what a time to completely ruin ones Friday evening. The folks here need to think about quality of food and service before proceeding any further is my very humble opinion."}
{"text":"Very bad service and attitude on phone.
The person I spoke was curt and impolite when I asked if mint or cilantro chutney was added in the veg sandwich and was told they cannot disclose the recipe !! (Yes you read it right ).To add I was pushed to order something else (Dosa) than what I wanted (Veg Sandwich)

When I asked for yelp's check in offer (which was valid for 3hours ) of free coffee/fresh juice -- suggested me to come on weekday so that they can check it. 

1st time enquiring at the new restaurant to try ... am sure it will be my last. Stay away.

Friendly advice to management : please take care of the customer service!"}
{"text":"one of the best south indian restaurants in calgary . Our to go place.This place reminds me of small restaurants with great food from india.They  have appam,ada pradam , many varieties of dosa that are not found in any restaurants in calgary. Good authentic food."}
{"text":"Awesome south Indian food joint in Calgary. It's not a fancy restaurant with ambience and decor but it serves its purpose of having good quality meal. We ate Mysore Masala dosa, idli and vada combo.. and both were outstanding. Keep it up Madras Cafe!!"}
{"text":"An excellent spot for Southern Indian food. The staff is very courteous and friendly and the food is simply delicious."}
{"text":"This place took me by surprise. I ordered a late night delivery, and a person from the restaurant actually brought the food right to my door, even though it was their closing time.. 
If you haven't tried this place before, you are missing out my friend. 
It was absolutely delicious and amazing. Cant wait to go back.."}
{"text":"Wonderful food - fresh, vibrant tastes, with lots of variety. Super naan. Simple surroundings - it's all about the food. Excellent experience. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place is really good! Dosa is nice and crispy. Sambar is ok, I like chennais sambar better but everything else is very tasty. Staff are very nice and humble."}
{"text":"Best South Indian food and filter coffee. All the dosa are awesome and taste like authentic Indian cuisine. The best masala dosa and chutney out of three states I lived in. People are very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"The thought process while eating this meal went as follows...
1.  This is really good.
2.  This is the best Indian food I've ever had.
3.  This is possibly one of the best meals I've ever had.

It's good.  They specialize in \"Southern Indian food\", which is different from the typical naan and curry that the majority of places in the US offer.  The Madras Curry was amazing.  A great blend of spices, and really, really tasty.  The spice was awesome, spicy, but not overwhelming.  The flavor was really unique as well.  The portion size was large, I left completely full and still had some to go.  I'd also recommend getting the Paratha bread with your meal.  It's amazing, sort of like a cross between naan and a tortilla.

The only smallest of complaints I can think of is that the mutton, with the bone in, took up a lot of space in the curry without offering much meat.  The meat that I did get off the bone was amazing immediately and fell apart in my mouth.  A little bit more meat and I would be content.

The service and everything else was great.

I'll come pack here next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Refreshing to have an authentic South Indian meal for a change. The spicy onion rava masala dosa is a must have with its crispy texture, the vada were incredible along with the pav bajji. To top it all off was the madras filter coffee wwas as authentic as can be. The service provided by Vinod and the rest of the team was excellent from start to finish. (They also had some cool Tamil music playing in the background which was also very cool)"}
{"text":"This is literally the best place for south indian food in Calgary and definitely better than anything in Edmonton. We have been regular customers for over a year and I am surprised at how their quality never wavers unlike most indian restaurants. Moreover the people serving the food are very pleasant and it is another big reason why we keep going there. The must trys at this place are the idlis, medu vadas and dosas. The idlis are the softest, reminding me of the ones my mother makes. The vadas are super crispy on the outside and super soft on the inside. And the dosas are always lovely and so are their sambar and chutneys! The only thing that they can work upon is the decor. Although, it doesn't me bother too much."}
{"text":"Authentic South Indian vegetarian food. Delicious food at a low price. Loved all their varieties. Definitely try the Veg thali during lunch and dosa varieties. A paradise  for vegetarians !!"}
{"text":"Excellent and authentic food. We went as a group of five, where everyone ordered something different and each one loved what they had ordered. Great food and equally good service."}
{"text":"Don't let the appearance fool you this place serves some great tasting food! It's unique flavours are mouth watering"}
{"text":"Food is great vegetarian food. Staff is helpful and friendly. Mango lassi is delightful."}
{"text":"The food was impeccable and made deliciously with flavorful and aromatic spices, herbs, and seasonings. I love every dish that they have for the Vegan buffet! :D"}
{"text":"Craving Dosa and this hit the spot. Not a lot of ambiance, but I like it that way - I felt like I was back in India getting the full meal deal. The owner is so full of light :)"}
{"text":"Seriously after posting my pictures, it's first thing in the morning and I want Indian food again, in fact I want everything I ordered last night again, that's how I judge a great restaurant, am I still excited about it the next day. And when I'm leaving, I am already contemplating coming with a group of eight, so we can order everything!! 

We ordered samosa chaat, chili rava dosa, chole bhature, Kashmiri naan, paneer butter masala and lemon rice! Everything was delicious. Service is attentive and she knows she is serving up some of the best Indian food in Charlotte!! 

The restaurant has an open kitchen concept, you can see everything while your food is being prepared. Indian food is the jam."}
{"text":"They have a buffet at lunchtime. All vegetarian (which I'm not) but it is absolutely delicious. They opened 5 months ago. I wish they had one in my area."}
{"text":"I ordered food online and it was good. But what happened before the food is the interesting part. 

There are two Indian restaurants pretty much right next door to each other. As I pulled up, I only saw one. The signage for this place was no illuminated, so it wasn't as apparent to me that it was there. So I walked into the other place asking for my order. They told me that they didn't have it and it must be next door.

Well, I went next door, which was this place and was not impressed. It really did look like a \"divey\" restaurant. I usually don't take issue with such things but the other place was so inviting and I was excited to eat the food. However, I did enjoy the food."}
{"text":"I drove all the way from Uptown Charlotte to have Indian veggie for dinner the place is so disorganized it took for them 40 minutes to bring in complete food. But still I was okay but it took them 20 more minutes to bring the remaining part of the food but still kept saying it will be ready in one minute. The food become cold and I am still waiting when I walked in they charged me the full price for partial food  I didn't said anything because hate to make scene. I ordered chick peas and spinach the chick peas wasn't cooked well. The only good point is lady on the counter was nice I guess that's why I didn't argue about the money. Over all disgusting experience they not only burned my appetite by charging full price they  killed my night. Horrible horrible experience. Personally I won't suggest this place to any of my friends."}
{"text":"I've never had a more bizarre experience at a restaurant in my entire life. 

My sister and I walked in and a man told us we could seat ourselves. We sat down and waited probably 10 minutes before anyone came to our table. It was the same man who initially greeted us. He did not ask us our drink order; instead, he informed us that they only had three items available. I thought that was a little strange, but I said okay and asked him to just bring us one of each thing. 

The same man returned about 10 minutes later with one plate of food and two spoons. The food I have to give them credit for as it was very tasty. I have no idea what it was though. He did not give us an extra plate so we were both leaning over the table eating off of the same plate. 

When we were finished, the man took my credit card payment and informed me that they didn't have any receipt paper so I couldn't get a receipt. 

Truly bizarre. I'm sure the rest of the menu is delicious when it's available, but I won't be back to find out. Easily the worst service I've ever encountered."}
{"text":"This is one of the best dosas I have ever had. I ordered a chicken vepudu dosa and it was perfectly crispy with a not-too-spicy, flavorful chicken blend, and was complimented wonderfully by the sambhar and two chutneys.  The place is very small but homey and quickly got packed! But it was worth the wait. It's a simple place that gets to the point with great food and a friendly atmosphere. My vegetarian parents also enjoyed their masala dosas as much as I enjoyed mine. Vegetarian options are plenty, to note."}
{"text":"We are so happy that we have a good vegetarian restaurant in charlotte. The new expanded menu is very welcome change and we love the food. It's a must visit restaurant whenever our family visit us. Don't miss gobi 65 and onion rava dosas!"}
{"text":"New ownership and amazing experience! We go here for lunch dates and get an amazing plate of food for a reasonable price! Also every Wednesday is dosa night. Unlimited dosas for only $9.99. excellent service and amazing flavors. One of our favorite places."}
{"text":"The problems with being a small town is that it doesn't really have a lot of competing indian food. And this is exactly what happened with Madras Cafe. Same is the case with Baton Rouge having only a couple of Indian restaurants. 

Their dosa - South Indian crepes - are okayish but they don't have that freshness which makes this one of the best anytime Meals. But you should still give this a try. It's better than their buffet. 

Their buffet doesn't have deserts and if you get a chance to have gulab jamuns (wiki this delicacy-- and get tempted) try that. 

They have a couple of rice options but the main lentil which makes a south Indian cuisine is the sambar. It's sautéed veggies cooked with lentil in tamarind sauce. That's not exactly a delight. 

They do have quite a good service though. They have a check in fresh juice - which has added sugars to make it not tangy. But if you like fresh, try asking them without sugar. 

The place is small, accommodates about 25. 

They are experimenting with their menu, so can just give them the benefit of the doubt and hence 3 starts."}
{"text":"I had heard negative comments  about their food and service. Finally tried this place. Service was ok, but food quality was awful. I tried both chaat and dosa. The owner recommended  the onion chili rava dosa when i tried to order something else . It was soaked and soggy with oil. The chaat dish was no better. Well, with so many Indian restaurants around, good part is one more place to cross out."}
{"text":"I ordered for pickup over the phone, mirchi and papadum. They said 15 minutes, cool.

Got there 15-20 minutes later and waited in the restaurant for another half hour. I asked if it would be ready soon. \"Soon, soon. 5 more minutes.\" After another 15 minutes I wanted to walk out, they already had my money. 

They handed me the mirchi. I said \"I ordered papadum too.\" \"Oh...5 more minutes please.\" 15 MORE minutes and I was on my way. Over an hour's wait for two snacks. It was good, but not so good that I'd ever wait like that again."}
{"text":"This spot is located next to one of my favorite Indian restaurants and I think they may be connected as I recognized some of the people working here from next door.  This spot is all vegetarian, and if you are not familiar with Indian dishes you will struggle with their menu because they offer no description of the menu items.  Thankfully, the guy I recognized from next door assisted me with the menu and I ended up with one of the many dosa's they offer and samosa's to go.  Minus a star because once my food was ready, no one remembered to bring it to me, which resulted in extended wait time.........they did apologize.  The dosa was good and was quite a bit of food, the samosa's were not very good and didn't taste fresh as I'm used to.  I may consider another visit, but I just felt so lost looking at that menu."}
{"text":"So happy to find an Indian Restaurant that is totally vegetarian - good selection of dishes and reasonable prices. Friendly, helpful service."}
{"text":"We're from out of town and wanted to try this place after seeing it in yelp. The food is great, very authentic South Indian cuisine, and so flavorful. The service is also great. Try the buffet in the weekends, it's a good selection. You judge the restaurant by the food and the excitement that the owner puts into it, not necessarily the atmosphere. This place reminds me of a restaurant you would go to in India, very authentic."}
{"text":"The restaurant has good amount of south Indian dishes, they should definitely improve on how to make idli and Madras coffee."}
{"text":"Went to Madras Cafe for the first time tonight. Got the Masala Dosa, Veg Manchurian, and Hakka Noodles. Split the dishes between three people. AMAZING. None of us had ever had Indian food before! Very reasonable prices, everything tastes so unique and delicious. The Manchurian was a bit spicy, but delicious! Our waiter also gave us complimentary Gulab Jamun for dessert! He thoroughly explained the menu, and was very helpful with our questions. We will definitely be coming back! (The dipping sauces with the Dosa were also so yummy, there were three included with the dish)"}
{"text":"Food was really good, highly recommend paneer Tikka, chole bhaturae and dosa. My initial plan was to go somewhere else but I am glad I came across this wonderful place. I will definitely stop by here every time I go from here."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. They were very helpful with things on the menu and even gave desert on the house !!! 10/10"}
{"text":"Very tasty and yummy food. The paneer chilly with pepper flavor was amazing. Very good restaurant for pure vegetarians."}
{"text":"This place is such a hidden gem! Tuesdays are vegan buffet (South Indian food) - all you can eat for $11. All the folks who work here are wonderful too. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"What a treat! This place serves authentic south Indian dishes..generous portion size. Love their variety of dosas. Friendly customer service. Ambience not that great. But with the food served I could get past that. A must try for their dosa."}
{"text":"The food is excellent yet again . My second visit here and met this amazing host with long hair , great service and hospitality. Awesome service !!"}
{"text":"Madras Cafe is a great restaurant to add to your list, given that it costs as little as you would pay for junk food. It has a decent slate of items that are different from the conventional alternatives out there. Remember that it's vegetarian."}
{"text":"I am a regular here and have always had great food and service here! I love their gobi manchurian and the dosa buffet on Wednesdays. Its a no-frills, great food place. The staff is super nice and always greet you with a smile. I will always keep coming back here :)"}
{"text":"1. Good service
2. tasty food! 
3. Very soft idlis!! 
4. Lively music. 
5. Will come back"}
{"text":"This is a great vegan and vegetarian restaurant, awesome buffet! It had almost everything off the menu. The manager was very friendly and got us all comfortable. The only backdrop was the space constrain, it seems to be a very cozy place. They should definitely consider expanding given the crowd coming in. The food was delicious, definitely going again especially if I'm craving dosa and idlis"}
{"text":"The place is very tidy an maintained.
We tried the dosas and they are good.
Service is excellent."}
{"text":"Ok.  I love Indian food.  We've been to every place in Charlotte.  Not literally, but I doubt there are more than a few places I haven't been.  This place is the real deal.  I got the Tahli, and I'm posting a video of the guy who served me.  It was truly a culinary delight.  We still love Woodlands, but I gotta say I like this place waaaay better.  So there's my review."}
{"text":"This one opens till 11 PM. Go only if you are looking for food in the late night.
Worst Service. 
Lot of Attitude and Impolite.
Below Avg to Average taste.
Took them 45 min to serve dosa and paratha.

Idly - 0/5 . Never order this.
Rava Dosa - 4/5
Masala Dosa - 3/5. 
Pongal - 4/5
Fried Rice - 2/5. Lot of oil.
Sambar is good."}
{"text":"Stopped here on our way to the airport before flying back to California. Thank god we did, one of the best meals we had on our trip and definitely the best in Calgary/Banff. 

Food is authentic, service is genuine and the flavors are perfect. 

We had chicken 65 (white meat with delicious spices that is deep fried but not oily, ask for a side of mint chutney), garlic rasam, onion/chili utthapam (pretty spicy, so watch out) and the chicken mughali (so, so good). Perfect meal. 

Apparently the chef came here from Spice Hut in Sunnyvale, CA to open his own joint. 

This place is legit for vegetarians & non-vegetarians alike."}
{"text":"Loved the food and the prompt service at Madras Cafe. Food was as good as the best hotel in Chennai.  A must to visit restaurant for south indian food especially Tamil Nadu cuisine."}
{"text":"Craving for South Indian snacks, that's te reason I visited here. I ordered idli and vada , then coffe . Nothing tastes good. There s only one waitress to handle 12 tables . So expect delay in getting served."}
{"text":"Lots of typical Madras food. Can try a couple of times. Good with neatness. Extra dessert varieties compared to other restaurants."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service .. My first dosa experience and Calgary and it was indeed amazing ... We ended up packing lot of food for take away.. Price is pretty high if I compare it to Vancouver .. But that's the case with entire Calgary and that's ok!!"}
{"text":"Everything except chaat dishes were awesome. The dosas were exceptional. Everything is reasonably priced. However they need some improvements in their chaat dishes.
Update: for the first time in my life I saw someone serve chutney with chhola batura. They just can't go together."}
{"text":"THE best South Indian restaurant in Calgary. Coming from India, I was missing authentic South Indian food. But that was before we found Madras Cafe, thank God! 

A few other so called Dosa places make north Indian styled dosas. For starters, Dosa is a south Indian dish and North Indian folks (I'm one of them) make dosas in a particular way (not necessarily good or bad) that's different from the way South Indian folks make it. I'm so glad Madras cafe makes it like south Indians :)

Staff is friendly, which helps. They also serve authentic filter coffee (and not Nescafe (instant coffee) in a filter coffee glass). We ordered Rava onion masala dosa and Paneer uttapam, both nicely made. The chai was also great (per wifey). Prices are also so reasonable. 

The only improvement they can do is on the decor. But since the product was awesome, not deducting any marks for that :)

Thanks for being there in Calgary. Will come back for sure."}
{"text":"They have very good food ever.. all The food items are very reasonable price.. owner is very welcoming and good service. All the food mostly from South Indian and love the food taste. This is my second visit and I will recommend others too. Thank you."}
{"text":"Authentic great tasting South Indian food. Lots of variety and friendly smiling staff."}
{"text":"Madras Cafe is honestly the best Indian restaurant in Charlotte. They have amazing South Indian and North Indian Food! Their paneer is the best. The staff is always courteous and helpful. Their menu is endless and they have new items all the time. They have a $10 lunch deal which comes with large quantity of food which is impossible to finish.

I love this place. Come here every week. And truly enjoy the experience. And yeah they have paan for after dinner which is my favorite!"}
{"text":"One of the very few options available for vegetarian only folks.
Crispy noodle dosa was the best so far at this place!"}
{"text":"Very nice service and excellent food. Their south Indian food ie. Dosas are some of the best in Calgary, and the service is very good, which is not a common thing for Calgary."}
{"text":"No way near to the name of the restaurant. Pathetic buffet. It was good for the first opening week and it slides. Rajbhog's management. The waiter lied that it did not have any branch. They have 1 huge porcelain plate for buffet where you have to dump in all items you need only once and that's it. I don't call it a buffet. Went 3 times and did not see improvement. This is Rajbhog employees canteen."}
{"text":"This is probably my most visited restaurant in Calgary. Don't be fooled by the size of the place or the ambience or the service.This is what I call the cheap and the best South Indian food in Calgary.

It's a Tamilian restaurant but Telugus like me or infact any other person who is from South India or likes South Indian food will definitely like it. 

The weekend buffet is 10$ which is nice. The ala carte ranges from South Indian tiffins to Biriyanis.

Having lived in biriyani capital of the world i.e. Hyderabad, I am a bit choosy about the taste of biriyani.
This is no Hyderabadi biriyani but the preparation is different and the taste is awesome.

All the tiffins like Idly, Dosa and Vada are up to the mark.

I generally end my meal with a coffee or tea and both remind me of home especially me being an addict of Bru coffee.

Ambience - 2.5/5
Service - 3/5 (Can be late during rush hours) 
Food - 4.5/5

Cost to quality - excellent."}
{"text":"I am surprised to see the overall rating being low for this outlet. Would have been here twice a week and they never disappointed me. Authentic South Indian food for reasonable price. Their dosas are very good in the area."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great prices, friendly service. Lots of veggie options. Try their friend cauliflower and onion masala dosa, both delicious. They also make a great spicy-milky-strong chai!"}
{"text":"This is the best little Indian restaurant in the NE. You cannot beat the price! Friendly service. I will definitely come back. I highly recommend the veggie biryani. The dosa was also so flavourful."}
{"text":"My wife and I always look for new places to try and we happened to drive by this place few weeks ago and decided to try it, and let me tell you we didn't regret the decision. We started out with samosa chaat and chilli idly which were both amazing after which our expectations were pretty high for the dosas we ordered, she ordered Mysore masala dosa and I ordered Chetrinad Paper Dosa as I wanted something with a little spicy kick. We were blown away by the size of the dosa but that was nothing compared to how amazing delicious the dosas actually were, the Sambar, tomato chutney, and the coconut chutney were a great compliment to the dosas. The spice level for each of the dosas was exactly how we wanted it and the dosas were perfectly golden brown and crispy. My wife has already asked to go back again, and back we will be!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place and I will be back! The service is amazing and they cater so kindly to plant based diets! All the food was delicious and it was so fun trying so many different dishes knowing all were vegan. Lots of different dishes to choose from as you can see. Again, I repeat the staff is amazing, kind and so smiley. Loveeeee the vibes of this place."}
{"text":"Happened to pop by Madras Café on Saturday and there was a lunch buffet for only $11.95 plus GST.  This lunch buffet was a simple one but it had papadums, pieces of roti paratha, different condiments for the dosa like sambar, a vege soup, a chicken chetiinadu curry, a cauliflower cooked with spices, 2 kinds of basmati rice: white and a chettinadu rice.  The Chettinadu rice was spicy with slices of green chili.  Delicious and spicy hot!  What was also neat was that the potato dosa was also included in the buffet!  They are fair-sized ones too, bigger than your usual dinner plate.  Eat your dosa with the coconut condiment and the different hot condiments from the buffet like the sambar.  It was so yummy!  Raita was also provided as an add-on to your food.  Dessert was Coconut halwah, not too sweet.  

We decided to also take home a mutton biryani and an egg curry - both were stupendous!   

The lunch buffet is for Sat & Sun only.  Loads of free parking outside the restaurant in the strip mall.  

This South Indian restaurant impressed us.  Will be back, as I told the staffer there!"}
{"text":"The butter chicken dosa is anazing! The service is very friendly.  The weekend buffet is great too. This ous muy favorite Indian restaurant in Calgary."}
{"text":"Great Food .... Recommend food to anyone !!!! Prices are reasonable and I come here regularly and is pleased every time! The coconut curry vegetable is my favorite. Paired with a freshly squeezed juice. Madras is by far the Best Vegetarian Food in town!! The service is really fast the restaurant is really clean. Whenever I don't feel like driving they deliver and they always get my order right. The delivery is really fast and efficient. Food portion is very satisfying and the ingredients taste authentic."}
{"text":"Whenever I want to try light vegetarian food I look for South Indian restaurants in the area. In North America outside the fine dining establishments, the South Indian restaurants are mostly small in size with light decor and small table chair setup. Madras cafe is such an establishment, small in size, light in decor. On to the food I am here for. Ordered a Mysore Masala dosa. Though I know but they were prompt in letting me know about the peanuts content. Mysore masala dosa with chutney on the insides and potatoes was very authentic. So were the coconut and peanut chutney served in the side and the sambhar. The masala tea as an afterthought turned out to be really good. Go for food and taste."}
{"text":"This is the best Indian restaurant I have ever eaten at! I normally have a hard time finding great Indian food with awesome service but this place is amazing! The owner Vijay helped me with what to eat and it was so wonderful!"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot in bay area. I like dosas here especially Podi dosa. My other favorite breakfast dish is Rasam vada, will get 2 vadas in a bowl of Rasam. 

They also serve some south indian rice dishes, next time I will try them for sure.They are closed on Mondays."}
{"text":"Great option for Vegetarians....
& service is awesome 
Highly recommend for madras cafe 
Will visit soon"}
{"text":"I am giving one star coz I don't see an option to give something lower than that , we visited this restaurant when they were just a few days old and totally we're excited to try , But it was such an unpleasant experience. We reached around 8:30PM and they would come to take an order only by 09:00PM ... We did place the order and until 10:00 PM we were not served. Not just that their entire system is so chaotic that during our wait they tried to serve us items that we hadn't ordered. Here is why I would never again visit this place .. After our one and half hour wait the chef( place being a open concept kitchen he could see the customers from the kitchen ) finally realized that we weren't served , came to us apologizing for what happened and also mentioned that he just got our order and he was gonna make it in the next ten minutes ... Well honestly we were very tired after the one  and half hour wait also with water dripping from the crappy air conditioner on my husband's head , we had to cancel the order"}
{"text":"Cheaters. That's what they are. They serve instant coffee in the name of filter coffee and charge higher filter coffee rates. If they're doing this for filter coffee then I can only assume they cheat on other things as well. 

The waitress made us wait for nearly 20 min for coffee. I had specifically asked her to check if filter coffee was available. Ten min later she came and told me it was. 15 min later I saw her mixing instant coffee. Until then she was doing other things that didn't require immediate attention. 

We were loyal customers and feel quite deceived. Will most definitely not go there again."}
{"text":"We visited Madras Cafe on a vegan buffet night and greatly enjoyed it!  Every dish we tasted was awesome and we liked having a comfortable and clean dining experience.  As a relative novice to this type of cuisine, I'm open to try anything but I wish some of the dishes were labeled - not because there were any restrictions (yay all vegan!) but because I'm curious as to the names of dishes I liked best to order in the future.  Customer service was excellent, the owner (manager? Host?) was very personable and asked if we were vegan and how we liked everything.  I'm sure if I didn't feel like such a noob he would have been more than happy to tell me the name of everything!  We look forward to visiting again!"}
{"text":"This place has the best dosas. I would highly recommend trying the kaara dosa !! Also, their red chutney is to die for. The garlic fried rice is too yummy....can't go wrong with this dish !! For vegans and vegetarians out there, you must try this place !! And something also coffee lovers...the filter coffee is heavenly !!"}
{"text":"This a decent place to get south Indian vegetarian food. Also a good find for vegans. It doesn't have a great restaurant setting but more geared for carryouts.

Food taste/cleanliness was good. Price reasonable. Though they claim to be a vegan restaurant, there are many NON VEGAN items on the menu and those items are not marked clearly. So you still have to ask and specifically request that your food be prepared vegan to be safe.

Service people are friendly and speak Tamil. NOTE: For the free drink/Yelp checkin, they insist that you post a positive review."}
{"text":"We tried the lunch buffet and absolutely enjoyed everything that was offered. The staff was super kind and welcoming. Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"One of the best veg hotel in the north Charlotte area...Recently they added dosa nite.. vareity of yummy dosas served hot and crispy..good hangout with family and frndz"}
{"text":"Went on a non-vegan buffet night.  Got the chickpeas with spinach - really yummy.  Also got a masala dosa.  I liked them both!  Wish dosas were a little more affordable (like around $5) since I tend to not be full w just one curry and like ordering a dosa as well.  Food quality is good.  Thry are understanding if you're vegan, just unfortunately the menu isn't clearly marked.

Remember Tues evening is a vegan all you can eat buffet though!"}
{"text":"Stopped on our way from NYC to Orlando on a road trip in search of some sumptuous South Indian food. The food is delicious!! Service impeccable! We order chinese as well and very impressive. Tomato chutney was delicious and so was the Manchurian. Being a NY/NJ resident have a good understanding and taste of indian food in US and this is worth mention."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Friendly staff. Easy on your wallet!! What more you want???

Some top dishes

Dosa
Pongal
Veg Biriyani
Mango Custard
Chole
Poori"}
{"text":"Good South Indian food. Servers were trying their best but there were short handed. Service can get better. Waiting time was more than expected but food was good."}
{"text":"Hands down the best and most authentic Indian food that I've ever had.  Staff was knowledgeable about gluten free and vegan options and made recommendations.  We will definitely frequent this place!  Eat here!"}
{"text":"After a really stressful day my husband and I joined the other Vegan City Charlotte group members for some fantastic food! My favorite dish was the Spinach Tofu Saag Paneer! It was the bomb! The Madras Coffee was so tasty too, and a very nice touch to the meal. Thank you for not putting sugar in it at my request. We will be back many times! Definitely a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing, portions quite appropriate and good authentic \"madras taste\",as the name states. 
The interiors however were dingy. The sofas were tearing at the seams and pricked through our skin. The taekwondo classes upstairs feel as if the building would fall on your head. 
The staff was very attentive and amazingly helpful. 
So, keep it as a take out option, since fine dining is not their forte."}
{"text":"My husband and I checked out Madras Cafe tonight for the first time. We were BEYOND impressed. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. This was our first dosa experience and we could not have been happier! The food was exceptional. Madras Cafe will be a regular staple for us. Absolutely wonderful."}
{"text":"We didn't have the buffet, but what we ordered from the menu came out nice and hot. Very good food. Probably one of the best onion Dosa we've had, and that's saying something since we're accustomed to the excellent Indian food from San Jose. Drinks weren't as good as the food. Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Food is really good.. and service also nice ! Dosa is really good.. keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite place for Indian food in Charlotte. They have great selections of healthy dishes - dosas, curries, appetizers. Their Ravi masala dosa is the bomb and top it off with Madra coffee its like you are in India;)
Please great people who run the show with awesome chef!
Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Don't order a Strawberry Rasgulla. You'll literally get a half cut strawberry along with with a Rasgulla. Hysterical right ???"}
{"text":"First time here and the food was amazing!. Everything was good, including the service and the price. Definitely coming back,Im not even a Vegan!"}
{"text":"This is is best dosa place in the area. We also visited on their unlimited dosa night.. I ordered almost all types of dosa..service was quick.
I liked there madras special coffee which is really good. 
This restaurant is just next to the Persis biryani. So those who are vegetarians can go to madras cafe."}
{"text":"Visiting Calgary on vacation stumbled on this place with authentic South Indian cuisine. Excellent food and service. We came back the second night because we already miss their food. Must try their mutton briyani and dosas. Poori and vadai was great too. Will visit again next time!"}
{"text":"While the food was just about ok always, they messed up my pickup order today and made me wait 30 mins to tell me they dont have one of the items in the order. Not coming back ever."}
{"text":"Finally a good South Indian place in North Charlotte. We were  a party of 9 and got a tonne of food here!  From  Masala Dosas to uttapams and chats, to top with the filter coffee . The food was delicious and very authentic. The staff was very friendly but they can definitely improve on the timeliness of the service. And did I mention that they are very reasonably priced as compared to the other Indian places in the area that don't serve food this good. Total bill was about $120"}
{"text":"I had chilli chicken( it was little spicy for me) and idle sambhar and it was so delicious. One of the best authentic indian food i had after such a long time. 
It doesn't happen so often that you get nostalgic after eating food at any indian restaurant. 
EXCELLENT FOOD. It made me nostalgic. I will recommend every indian food lover to definitely try this place."}
{"text":"Just came to Calgary for the first time and saw this place on yelp. The seating area did not do the food justice. Wonderfully prepared food. We ordered three dosas which we did not take photos of because we were too excited and hungry after traveling all day. Me and my family were not disappointed at all. It's a must try!"}
{"text":"This place has excellent Indian food. I am no expert, but it's authentic and each dish is so well prepared. The staff is friendly and accommodated take-out, no problem. I've tried several of the dosas and they all are tasty and freshly made. The chili idly was spicy and very good. The saag paneer was some of the best I've tasted. You can also tell this is a great spot because all the local Indian folks eat here! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"One of the worst customer service and quality of food I have ever seen.
Me and my friends went here for lunch. And one of my friend had already warned us that they keep saying they have run out of things. But I wanted to be more optimistic. 
The first thing the waiter did after we ordered food was that he said they had run out of one of the item. So we had to change that order (Still being optimistic). After that the food came in. That is when I realized that the ratio of the items and the chutneys required for those items were hilarious. It's as if they're trying to say - \"You have to manage with this\".
Oh by the way, one of the chutney (Tomato) and the sambar did not taste as expected, and I'm saying this in a bad way. The only good chutney got over pretty fast. And when asked for more cups, we got the same answer. That they had run out of it and had scraped the utensil and managed to get us 1 and a half ultra small cups. 
We also ordered the gobi manchurian which is supposed to be crispy, but what we got was wet, soggy gobi manchurian sautéed with some green onions in tomato sauce (literally ridiculous). And to top it off, the gobi was raw inside.
Finally we gave up and asked for the cheque, which we had remind them twice to get it. And then they had charged us for the juices that were supposed to be free as we had checked in. We had to remind them about that too.
Unfortunately, the experience was really bad with both the quality of food and the service. If you're running out of items, you either prepare more when it's getting over or you remove them out of the menu. Instead they feel good giving such kind of service to their customers."}
{"text":"Excellent food l!! Dosa was really good...nice place for veg lovers..also try the filer coffee!!"}
{"text":"My family and I found this place yesterday while going to the bank. So we decided to check them out. It was our first time trying Indian food. We tried a little bit of everything that was recommended. The food was amazing. Service was fast and friendly. We will definitely come back and try some more items off the menu."}
