{"text":"I just really looooooooooooove this food truck i literally go here with my husband at least once a week , waaay better than an actual restaurant and way cheaper too :)"}
{"text":"Best hawaiin food in Vegas bomb af. They run out of stuff a lot but just get something else dummy I've had most of the menu items and it's all been good so far"}
{"text":"A new food truck that serves  Hawaiian BBQ. I had the Korean Chicken plate and it was delicious! Second time around I had the chili Frank plate and that was good too! Being from Hawaii, this did takes me back to the islands :) Will definitely go back for both!"}
{"text":"A food truck stationed right outside of a bar- it's genius.  I don't hang out at said bar, but Ono's is walking distance from my house so I forsee a lasting relationship.

They're currently in soft opening so the menu is a bit limited, but they feature plate meals (~$10) with curry, chili, bbq chicken, etc and sides of rice and mac, as well as musubis with spam and portuguese sausage. The prices seem reasonable and the portions are good, and everything is made fresh.

EDIT: Dropping a star. I don't know what's going on. Their posted hours have been removed and it's hit or miss whether they'll be closed for weeks or open three days in a row for lunch. Is this a business or a hobby?"}
{"text":"I ordered the Korean chicken. It's overpriced, small portion, bland, and not good. This place sucks. ITS NOT ONO!!! I would not recommend that you order the Korean chicken. I will try another dish next time. If it's the same then this place is just not worth going to. Crappy Hawaiian food I've had in a long time. So disappointed"}
{"text":"Good is made to order delicious and the prices are on the cheaper side compared to most Hawaiian BBQ"}
{"text":"Very disappointed that's how much chili you're going to give? Really unbelievable don't know how I feel been coming here for a while and now they've been giving less and less"}
{"text":"I went tot the farmers market for the first time this Sunday. The chicken from the truck smelled soooo good I just had to grab something. I tried the mini teriyaki bowl and I regretted it. I should have gotten the large!! I ate the mini so fast it didn't even make sense. I'll be back next week for the large!"}
{"text":"Maybe I caught him on a off day but I was expecting so much much more after reading previous reviews. My bbq chicken and my daughters was burnt. The teri beef and chicken curry was good but everything else was meh. Its worth trying if your in the area not worth driving more then 5 miles for. Hopefully one day we will have a Hawaiian joint open as good as Island flavor in the Summerlin area."}
{"text":"I am completely in love with their chicken katsu and their masubi. They super friendly, professional and knowledgeable about what they're  offering. I remember the first night I had their I just died and wanted more but I didn't have much money to get another. I want to try their chili that they were telling me about cause I love me some chili. I plan on coming to them this Friday for their chicken katsu. I'm just a walking distance away from them. Hopefully I can try everything from their menu. Awesome job"}
{"text":"From an islander who lives in Las Vegas this place brought me back home with just one bite. I will forever recommend this spot and forever love this spot. The love and compassion these men have for their customers is true Islander way and Islander style. Keep up the good work boys! Mahalo"}
{"text":"We ordered the chili frank plate,mini Korean chicken,mini Chicken Katsu, Kalbi plate, and saimin.
All were excellent in taste. It is really good for a lunch wagon. It takes time so I recommend that you call ahead for your order through the bar's phone number."}
{"text":"Best Hawaiian BBQ food hands down authentic and freshhhhh will recommend, Im definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Ordered the BBQ short ribs and it was delicious. The location of the restaurant is easy to find and current hours are 10 am to 8 pm."}
{"text":"Good stuff. I was pleasantly surprised at how good the BBQ chicken plate was. The Mac salad was the best I've ever eaten. Wanted to go back for more. I will go back and I would recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"If you love food trucks hooly have to check this place out!! Good food priced right and always fresh"}
{"text":"I ordered the Katsu chicken, it was better then the other places I have had here in town by far. The stand it's self was super clean and the service was on point. I highly recommend stopping by when you have a chance to and getting some Hawaii style BBQ

{"text":"Aweeome little place good food right next to my work so a go to when looking for food"}
{"text":"Great food, Really great Cook, feels like I'm back home in the 808. Love it here, preferred Cash"}
{"text":"I ordered 2 plates and was very disappointed with them I ordered a mix plate and when I opened it it looked like a mini plate. I then opened the sweet sour spare ribs plate to find that the ribs and pineapple were cooked for far too long that it became just mush. I'm sorry I understand just starting a business and making ends meet but serving me sub standard food at full price is a no go. I am from hawaii and support any business with hawaii ties. But I felt like I got ripped off big time. I can't see going  back anytime soon"}
{"text":"I really can't understand the 4 & 5 stars for this food truck. Maybe I got them on an off day or maybe when it comes to Hawaiian food I am very critical because I'm from the islands. Either way, after taking 3 bites my stomach sent my brain a message that said if you continue to eat, I'll make your night a living hell. I ordered the korean chicken plate and my friend got a fried saimin plate. She had to stop eating because she said her noodles were spicy. Never have I ever heard of or had spicy fried noodles, so our theory is that they used the same cooking utensils for each dish and didn't clean it off in between touching separate items. She too couldn't eat all her food. I've eaten at various Hawaiian food places and this is not one that will be on my list to go back too.

Now for the service. The young man that helped was courteous and nice. There was a little elderly lady that came up to ask for food and I offered to buy her some. She asked for coffee but he stated they didn't have any so after I paid I went into 7-11 to go get her some. When I came back the ordering window was closed and she told me the Asian guy kept yelling at her to leave. Whoa whoa whoa. Not kewl, especially if you say you're from Hawaii. Where's your hospitality? Aloha spirit? So we waited and waited and waited for our food. I was the first person there, the young guy opened up the window a few minutes after I arrived and probably only because I asked him what time they were supposed to be open. They advertise 10am but this my second time coming around lunch time and the truck was closed. This time he had the side door open which is why I asked. But back to the wait, so apparently there were 2 orders in front of me because people ordered in the bar? So beware when you go because even though you may be the only person at the truck, there may be other orders delaying yours from patrons in the bar."}
