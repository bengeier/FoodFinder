{"text":"Absolutely horrible place, can skip  !   If the rating system would let me, the place would get zero star. 

First off, expect you clothes (from top layer to under garments) to smell like the place when you are done, air circulation was almost non exist.  I was sweating all along and could not feel a single drop of AC, on top of that, be constantly prepared to fan off those pesky small flies that try to share your food.

The food was ok, we ordered 5 plates and they were all overly salty.  We had to warn a friend to watch her consumption, since she had issues with high blood pressure.  One thing I noticed about the cooking was that red hot pepper and green pepper were aplenty on every single dish. Even the sour vege and fish soup was chockablock with them.  

In addition, you better be a fast eater.  While we were trying to enjoy our food and half way through eating (but long before we were going to ask for the check), different waitress came around 4 times in less than 5 minutes to ask if they could take our plates away or bag them for us.  I guess it if were a busy night, then you can forget about spending time with your friends or enjoy the food you have ordered.   Yes, there were people waiting outside, but It is really bad customer service to try to rush your diners.  We got so irritated that we had to tell them to stop bugging us.  

One thing I know for sure, none of us are going back there."}

Ok, after a night of HOT POT we were walking back the car when my Gf's dad noticed this place.

He had eaten at a lot of places in northern China and the memories of this genre of food always brought him back to good times and good food.

We decided to try this place the following week and he was so excited to find a place that could possibly match the ones in his memory.

We ordered quite a bit of dishes, (He was like a kid in a candy store.)

Here's our order:

1.) Porkbones - the dish that came out was pretty much boiled pork bones with soy sauce poured over them. boring and not appetizing at all. MEH~

2.) Spicy cucumber - seems like they make this a couple of nights before and stuck it in the fridge. The ingredients were not fresh at all and it looked like SHLOP. (pig food)

3.) Spicy Eggplant - this dish was good. (or was it because the 2 previous dishes were so bad? IDK)

4.) Fishhead with tofu soup. - Way too many fish bones in the broth and it was very smelly! the tofu used was sour as if almost spoiled. and the fish smell still lingered as if they didnt even wash it before they cooked it. (ERmpf*)

5.) Spicy beef - Again this was refridgerated the night before. the beef was horrendously tough and the tripe they used (instead of tendon) was.. oh man.. I just puked in my mouth thinking about it. (sorry for the graphic nature of this review)

6.) Water-boiled fish - horrible horrible dish! Imagine fillets of talapia with cold oil poured over it and then topped with chilli peppers. 

7.) Perserved vegetable soup - another dish that looked unappetizing. they should have named the dish \"Shrek's diaherra\"

The washroom are smelly and nasty. No joke, you will always get hit by the swinging door if you are taking a piss at the urinal. its just that cramped. 

The waitress are wearing some weird outfits.... thats all I got to say.

Enter at your own risk!"}
{"text":"I'll make this review brief.

Restaurant environment was dirty, from the ceiling to the floor; however, the bowls and chopsticks seemed clean.

The food quality was visually unappetizing.. they gave me the feeling of how they don't care much about their food, just as long as the food is editable and gets on the plate is all that matters.

Owner of the restaurant came out and tried to act all friendly, but unfortunately every time he talks above my head, his spit would land on top of my head and on the food I was eating.  I gave the 1 star for the free shower I got from him.

Owner gave us free dishes on the house, but right off the bat I could tell that the meat they gave us were about to go bad and they had to get rid of it ASAP. 

The crab dish didn't taste fresh at all even though the owner came over and told us that he had a secret aquarium at the back where they only cook live fresh crabs!.. 

Didn't go to the washroom because I read the other reviews about how dirty and cramped it was.

Overall, I won't be coming back even for the free food and shower."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday around 7pm, didn't have to wait for a table. I was a bit hesitant about trying this place given the review but those were from a while ago and my girlfriend wanted to try it so I went along.

Inside is nothing special but the food was decent. You get free pork bone with meat on it. We ordered 4 dishes and the bill came up to $33 so price is very reasonable.

The menu is only in Chinese and there are no pictures fyi."}
{"text":"Double Win Restaurant English name has not relation to its Chinese Name... but seems like the whole restaurant has nothing in English but their address..

Menu has all the standard of Northern Chinese restaurant, pricing are reasonable too with nothing really over $10 aside from lobsters and crabs dishes.

Since I am with a non spicy eater, so I ended up stuck with eating non spicy dishes.

Number One Bones($5.99)
- under the Chef's recommendation but really disappointing.. as it is really just pork bone cooked tender in soup then finished with a soy bean sauce

Beef with onions ($7.99)
- Soy Sauce based.. Beef a little tough.. 

Garlic Vegetables ($6.99)
- Best dish of the evening.. savoury and healthy the same time

Waitress in sleeveless uniform with shorts...looks a little awkward...

There are so many other similar restaurants in the area and even in the same plaza, I don't think I will be back to Double Win..."}
