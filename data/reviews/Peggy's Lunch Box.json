{"text":"This little hidden gem is a must try for breakfast. It was my husbands and I go-to spot on the weekends before we moved out of town. It's super delicious, the women who do the cooking are sweet as pie, and the food portions are very generous. Not healthy, but really good food!"}
{"text":"Always had excellent breakfasts here. We had options of Beachwood Marriott breakfast, Bob Evans, or Peggy's. We always chose Peggy's and were never disappointed. Only thing is that it is cash only so be prepared, great place for breakfast, can't personally comment on lunch since I never had it, but friends give it kudos..."}
{"text":"My husband and I had some friends visiting from out of town and we decided to take a chance on this place.  We were pleasantly surprised!  The service was probably the best I've ever experienced!  My friend had a cold and the waitress graciously offered her some cough drops.  They treated us like gold - very rare to find such friendly and accommodating service.  The portions were very generous and the food was delicious!  We will certainly be back!

The only draw back...they only take cash."}
{"text":"Only open for breakfast and lunch this is the epitome of \"Greasy Spoon\".   Food is good, plentiful, and cheap.  Don't expect to eat healthy. A favorite for big greasy breakfasts.  It's small and fills up sometimes.  Have yet to not get a table however."}
{"text":"I have gone to Peggy's for years my father would take us as kids all the time. Food and service was always great. I haven't been to Peggy's for a few years until just recently, it is no where near how I remember it being. Food was terrible. It took for ever for us to get our food and then it wasn't even hot and you could also tell that they buy poor quality ingredients which is to bad since the prices on the menu have probably doubled since I was there last. And last but most important of all the service was horrendous we were there for breakfast and I had to continually ask for my coffee to be refilled. We will never be going back. I would rather go to bob Evans and I hate bob Evans."}
{"text":"Making a stop on our road trip to visit Brandywine Falls, looking for a breakfast restaurant and I find this little gem.   My expectations were not very high given the low prices but I was very happy with my meal.   The bacon was medium thick and had a nice smokey flavor. My corn beef hash was what looked like hand sliced potatoes with chunks of corn beef.  Delicious! If you find yourself in the area take the extra 5 minutes to drive past the chain restaurants and try something that has a home cooked feel."}
{"text":"Great breakfast. I'm hooked on the bacon+mushroom eggs benedict and the helluva mess (potatoes, eggs, onions, mushrooms, sausage in a big yummy pile). Between me and the friends I've brought there, we've ordered just about everything on the menu and everything was delicious.

Great portions, great prices, friendly service."}
{"text":"Just had the best corned beef sandwich! No surprise considering she makes the best corned beef hash I've ever eaten! The ONLY place that had ever made my eggs perfect (and hot) no matter how I ordered them every time. All the soups are made from scratch. Peggy's is a rare little gem tucked away in the quaint tiny village of Northfield."}
{"text":"Good family place. Staff friendly. Made to order. Just a little greasy spoon with local hard working staff. Breakfast is really good. Lunch decent. Worth the stop. Do not have to twist my arm to eat here."}
{"text":"Everything here was fantastic. All the great breakfast foods were available, and the only con was that it's cash only. I got a specialty pancake of chocolate chips and peanut butter which was amazing. My date got French toast, bacon and hash browns and he loved everything. All in all, great meal and would def eat it again."}
{"text":"Only getting one star since I have to! Years ago it was a great place. Now the service sucks, my husband had to ask to get a coffee refill. I ordered the blueberry pancake special ($5.75!), they were burnt on the out size and not cooked in the center, just a pile of mush. Very disappointed! Not the same Peggy's it was about 5 years ago. You also must pay with cash only, come on now it's the 21st century even vending machines take credit cards; get with the times!"}
{"text":"We are just passing thru Cleveland and discovered Peggie's.   Great breakfasts!
2 eggs, 2 bacon, 2 sausage, toast and home fries for $5.99!  Can't beat that anywhere!  Not far off the tollway and worth the stop!
You might even see Peggy at the grill behind the counter!"}
{"text":"This place is a classic American Diner.  The food is good and the plates are huge.  The staff is friendly and they always remember what my dad and I get when we come in.  It is my favorite breakfast place in town. The hash browns are amazing, I don't know how they do it but whatever they do works."}
{"text":"Drove by this place for years....then last summer, I stopped in with my family for breakfast. Awesome!  The people are nice and the food is prepared perfectly and served hot.  Stopped recently with a friend and once again, the food was great. I had an omelet, which was amazing and prepared to order. I think my friend took her family back already! So good!"}
{"text":"We have been here on week day when off work and really good deals. fast service and good food. Friendly service and quick with coffee refill. We decided to check out on a Sunday and place packed. you can sit at counter and we were able to find a table in the back and waited on right away.  we love supporting small business and as long as good and consistent we will come back."}
