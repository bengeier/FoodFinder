{"text":"Placed an order at 6:35pm and the order delivered at 9:05pm and i stay 2 milea away. Funny thing when called about status of order the reason - ' we are running late 30 mins for each order' and ' roads are not safe'. What i do not understand is why take orders when we can't fulfill them in a timely fashion. 
Delivery person says was just asked to deliver. Not sure who to believe. Worst wait times ever."}
{"text":"Really great food! Went around 11:45 for the buffet and it was amazing! I liked every single thing I got. I eat mostly vegetarian and there were endless options. Will be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been looking for top tier Indian in Madison for a long time. We were so happy when we found om! Amazing food we had the somosas, their version of chicken 65, and two curries. All fantastic and left overs for days. Later that week I was surprised to see my credit card had been over charged. I was super nervous because I didn't have my reciept but when we called, the owner was incredibly gracious and helpful and had the issue handled so quickly. We were so happy out amazing experience wasn't sullied by this mistake."}
{"text":"We had an excellent time here! A lot of it was due to how incredibly kid friendly the place was, which you just don't see a lot with Indian food restaurants. Our 2 1/2 year old loved the little play area and the host/waiters/food staff were all super friendly to him and showed him how the food was made. 

We got the butter chicken and paneer tikka masala, both which were excellent, along with an order of garlic naan. There were a couple of little chicken bones in the butter chicken, but nothing to ruin the sauce. The naan was tasty.  We went on a Sunday night and there weren't a lot of people in there, hopefully just because it was Sunday and they are still new. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I adore this place. Their food is fantastic and the service is top notch. I always feel welcome even though I am not what one would consider a regular. I've noticed that as a patron you get what you put in. I'm not sure how these negative yelpers act while dining but I have never been disappointed here."}
{"text":"Really nice new Indian restaurant on the east side! Long cocktail list and 2 nice areas with bar seating. Also surprisingly kid friendly- they have a nice kids menu and also a play area for kids next to the seating area- basic, with a few toys but really nice touch. If you don't like kids the place is big enough that you probably won't be seated next to any. The food was good-spice level was definitely suited to midwestern audience so if you order medium it's going to be pretty mild. I didn't try the dosas or tandoori options so definitely want to come back for that but the lentil and chicken dishes I had were super savory. Menu also has pasta for those who aren't into Indian food but I didn't have that so can't rate it. Friendly service and nice, clean decor. Will definitely come here again and this time I'll sit at the bar by the kitchen so I can watch them making everything!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our dinner at Om very much, food delicious, service attentive and friendly.  It is a bit noisy when full,  just the nature of the place, nothing to absorb sound.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is the only Indian restaurant actually worth going to. We drive half hour to go there every weekend even though there are many other places close by. Love the south indian stuff, specially the dosa. Quality of food is great. People running the place are friendly, though the wait staff can be  a bit slow. Great overall."}
{"text":"Bad food, bad service. They deserve a negative rating. Their chicken 555 was so pathetic, no taste, the red spicy sauce tasted like they opened a can of spicy red sauce and mixed it with expired deep fried old chicken. Their French fries seemed like they pulled out a 5 years old packet of frozen French fries which when fried soaked up all the grease. Yuck!
Whoever gave them a high rating don't know what good quality food is.
I placed an order by phone an hour before pickup, giving them enough heads up to keep our food ready and they had not even started cooking it."}
{"text":"The food was great. We went before dinner time (5p) so it wasn't very busy. The service was great. I really like the vibe. Simple and clean. Lots of menu choices. I'm very happy this place opened up where it did. Hopefully this area will get some more restaurants like Om.  


1/1/18 Still love this place. Hands down the best. I travel for work and generally get home on holidays and they're one of only a few restaurants open and delivering. Customer service is great. So great."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! The tikka masala was to die for. The space was clean and updated. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Been here twice now. Excellent service,  excellent food. Everything is very well cooked and seasoned. If you like bland food and if you're not used to Indian food don't come here. Om is a great place for spicy and tasty food."}
{"text":"Excellent...locally run and diverse menu.  Family friendly and food is fresh with vegetarian options clearly marked!"}
{"text":"Disappointing dinner experience!! Took 30 minutes to take the order..took 1 hr to get the order which was wrong..ordered chicken , got a curry with corn and carrot bits, lots of confusion regarding the menu..no idea about the food items to the servers, understand that it's a new place, but could have been far better..finally 15 bucks for a biryani serving which is very very less..too expensive..very bad experience.."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a tue..place is very nice inside and clean..looks better interior than u will think upon arrival,but we all know that doesn't mean the most,as i've had Indian food at more shabby spots that was a bit better...food and choices was not bad.my suggestion is to invest in better buffet containers to make sure the food stays more than lukewarm,which is what the temperature was today..will come back"}
{"text":"The butter chicken is sooo good!  The chicken was moist and juicy.  Menu had a good variety as well."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place out since it's fairly new and we like Indian. My partner was especially craving masala dosa. They had the standard Indian fare along with weird Asian fusion options that we stayed away from. Partner got the masala dosa and I got shathi paneer, a creamy tomato sauce and Indian cheese. 

The dosa was huge, about 18\" in diameter, but the filling could have fit on a saucer. The dosa itself was barely crunchy and without the subtle sour flavor on the inside. The paneer was creamy but fairly flavorless. I couldn't detect any of the promised spices. I asked for mild, but I'm used to mild still being a little spicy. At Om mild means absolutely no spice at all.

If you are looking for authentic Indian flavors, keep going up E Washington and check out Maharana on Thierer Rd. Om is pleasant and comfortable, but very plain. A good choice for sensitive palates and young kids, not for great lovers of Indian food."}
{"text":"It's 4th of July and most of the restaurants were closed, we saw this place and thought we'd try it. We have been to India numerous times, and this is amazingly good and authentic Indian food.  A great menu with lots of choices, and the quality was first class. We highly recommend this place if you like Indian food or if you want to try something delicious and different."}
{"text":"Been here twice so far, and both times had a great experience.  I would give a 5star if some of the prices were a little bit lower and the service was faster.  The first time we went we waited over an hour for our meal, which wasn't a big deal since it was a date night and they had almost every table full.  We got curry chicken with basic naan, garlic naan, and veggie samosa's.  Everything was really tasty and done very well, and our service was good aside from the longer wait than anticipated.

The second time I flew solo and brought a book expecting another wait but was there earlier and one of few tables.  I got the Chicken Saag (spinach) with regular naan which is one of my favorites at most Indian places, and definitely wasn't disappointed.  The order came out quick, the meal was delicious, and I was surprised to finish it by myself.  I easily could have made it two meals, but I was incredibly hungry, so the portioning is great for a single dish.  

I'm excited to get back there again and try another dish!"}
{"text":"I actually registered this account specifically to relay this anecdote.

The food here was great -- got the Saag Paneer and some appetizers I can't remember. It was all awesome and there's not much more to say on that front.

As good as the food was, OM was even more memorable for the quality of the people who run the establishment. 

My friend's car wouldn't start when we tried to leave, due to some issue with the ignition. The fellow who seemed to be in charge -- even though he also served us and took our order -- was incredibly generous and helpful. He first spent about ten minutes trying to help us fix the car. When it became clear that the car wouldn't be fixed, he offered to give us a free ride home while leaving the car overnight until the mechanics opened again.

These guys are great, and it's nice when you know the money you're spending is going to good people."}
{"text":"An Indian restaurant with Wi-Fi for customers and charging outlets at the booths can't be all bad. And the place looks really classy. My wife enjoyed her mushroom masala a lot, although next time we'll ask for a little more if the tasty sauce. My Goan fish was cooked just right. Portions were a good size. We ordered the \"medium\" spice level--just spicy enough for us though probably the maximum level your average Wisconsinite could tolerate. Next time I order much hotter. The ginger chai martini was fantastic; I recommend it if you're adventurous. 

Good selection of vegetarian options.

I've heard one complaint from a friend  about the open kitchen, which I find odd as it's fairly common if you stick a toe outside the Midwest.

Here's hoping OM sticks around for a while, as we'll be back."}
{"text":"The chicken, prepared halal, was incredibly moist and tender in the butter chicken... most Indian places overcook their meat in my experience. This was AMAZING.  I've never had butter chicken this good. Lots of southern Indian styles to choose from on the menu, too, which is a nice contrast to the usual North Indian styles everywhere else. Don't let the \"fusion\" title fool you; the Indian dishes are classic. I think fusion refers to the fact that they have a few non-Indian dishes available too; a great choice for that one friend who doesn't like Indian food, since they had a few other non-Indian options like Chinese or even a hamburger. They also have a bar area. Definitely going back the next time I'm in Madison! Service was on pointe."}
{"text":"While heading back to Minneapolis from Chicago we placed a to-go order of uttappam, pongal & idly. Food taste really good including chutneys. Thumbs up  & Definitely a must go place."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner there on a weeknight last week. Friendly folks,not busy seated right away. Fried vegetable appetizer was nicely done. Service a little slow and tiny water goblets (cute but then leave a carafe because refills were hard to come by, hence the 4 stars). Big menu and for an occasional Indian eater, hard to know differences. The tile work in the bar was pretty, they had the fire going for ambiance I'm sure but just not necessary on a hot day. Dishes were tasty, standard servings.my husbands rice dish was too spicy but that's our fault. We'll go back if they can stay open. The location,while visible, only has access off east Washington so you have to be strategic in your approach. Most importantly for us is we could hear each other talk."}
{"text":"Came in with a big group and everything we ordered was excellent. The samosas were incredible as was the tamarind sauce that they serve them with. This place impressed me more than almost all of Madison's restaurants."}
{"text":"So good! I kept being surprised at how tasty every bite was. They were very conscious of GF diners. I've had poor experiences with several Indian restaurants recently, so I'm excited that I have a good restaurant that I can count on!"}
{"text":"I dined at OM for the first time today for lunch. We were immediately greeted and seated by the friendly hostess. The restaurant is very clean which I noticed and appreciated right away. It has an open feel to it, especially with the partially open kitchen where you can watch the cooks prepare the food. The kitchen too gave a clean impression. Instead of standard plates and cups they have more traditional serving ware which allow plenty of space for food and sauces. The standard Indian buffet staples of tikka masala and mango chutney were curiously missing from the buffet. I am not sure whether that is intentional or if those items just weren't offered today. Aside from wishing I had some mango chutney for dipping sauce I didn't miss those items being offered because the remainder of the selection made up for it - especially the peanut/coconut chutney. The mushroom curry and cashew curry were my two favorites, as well as the Dal. I appreciated that the curries weren't completely mild and had some spice to them. The hot chai was outstanding as was the Gulab Jamun. The best I have had in Madison. Service was friendly and fast. I also enjoyed the Indian music in the background. Definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"great great indian food. super friendly service and had a good time looking into the open kitchen. my family and i were driving from Minneapolis to Chicago and this was right on our way, and we were craving indian food. OM had good value, delicious food, the nan was spectacular!! we would absolutely visit again, and highly recommend to anyone who is in the area!!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner with a big group 
Started kind of slow and.we were ok with that
Service was very slow and the entres were not served together 
The food was fine though and the chef seemed to know his way around
Perhaps these are starting  challenges and we plan to go back after a month or so and see if the ratings needs to by increased"}
{"text":"The food was great! Even though the restaurant says it's fusion, the food is really authentic, and has a South Indian flavor. We had the thali, Hyderabad biryani and chicken chettinad, all of which were great. The rasam tasted like home (South India)! Get the gulab jamun for dessert!"}
{"text":"If you want your ordered food to be thrown on some others door go ahead and order from this place. If you can't take the responsibility of delivering the food in the right place at the right time don't  go for it. You guys should make sure that you give proper instructions to your delivery employees."}
{"text":"I'm so glad we heard about OM Indian Fusion Cuisine in time to get there for the grand opening! The restaurant has breathed new life into the building and to that corner of East Washington and Stoughton - so needed and so refreshing!! The space itself is beautiful, upscale and inviting, with soft colors I wouldn't have expected from an Indian restaurant, but was pleasantly surprised to find. And I can't say enough good things about the cozy fireplace and cool logo! I really loved the open kitchen concept the owners chose to put into the space - the chefs work their spices, sauces, and doughs entirely from scratch. Yep, it takes a bit longer to prepare that way, but I really enjoyed getting to watch the care that went into my meal, and everything tasted, oh, so good! The goat curry and saag paneer were divine. The staff is a culturally diverse group, and I could tell that our waitress was still learning about Indian cuisine, but seemed passionate about it. Kudos to the owners for making the \"fusion\" part of their place about so much more than the menu. We will be back, and often!"}
{"text":"Been here now three times. And I am impressed with the fusion food.
Location: Meh. Decor is ok, ambience just above average.  But close to house so go to place on days when wifey isn't cooking.
Staff: Friendly and welcoming. But food takes time to come on the table which can test your patience at times when you are really hungry and all that awesome smell is teasing your taste buds.
Food: We have tried Chicken/goat Dum biryani - it's ok  not that great so we tried 
Chicken/Goat thalipakkatu biryani: very nice, wonderful flavours, meat well cooked and good quantity
Chicken chettinad: nice gravy, good flavour. Try having with chappathi. 
Chicken Schezwan: nice flavour. Good quantity.

All in all, I like this place and is definitely a try if you are a fan of fusion food."}
{"text":"I can say I tried Indian food, but I was a definitely not a fan. Everything had so much spice! It would've been nice to try some milder dishes to start with for my first try. But the service was great and it is a beautiful restaurant."}
{"text":"Om has to be my new favorite Indian restaurant in Madison. I've been there a few times now, and each time the food has been stellar. Their lunch buffet is amazing--as good as anything you get in South India. All of their South Indian dishes have a very authentic touch. The decor is nice too--they actually custom made their signature motif. Service has always been great."}
{"text":"Went for the lunch buffet randomly with a co worker and was pleasantly surprised. The flavors were bursting and the textures were amazing. Pretty reasonable for a buffet and there was plenty to choose from! I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Maybe it was just the butter chicken, but the quality of meat was poor and overall not as good as several other madison Indian options"}
{"text":"The food at Om is excellent, with a large menu including unfamiliar cuisine from Kerala and other South Indian regions. The \"fusion\" may refer to their Indo-Chinese specialties, however, these are a regular part of Indian food today--there are a few Italian pasta dishes on the menu, although why anyone would order Italian food in a basically Indian restaurant (and with so many actual Italian restaurants in Madison) is beyond me. We had a variety of appetizers and entrees, including aloo bonda, an unusual and tasty stuffed pepper, lamb biryani, eggplant curry, and goat curry, all of which were enjoyed. The problem was with the service, which was disorganized at first (it took several tries to get an actual cup of hot water for tea), and almost non-existent when two of us ordered desserts--it must have taken a half hour for them to arrive, and we had to ask more than once. They were understaffed that night, one of the servers said they had a last minute staff cancellation--but still, it was a bit much--they whole meal took about 2 hours--too long. In their favor, the desserts (a gulab jamun and a gajar halwa (carrot pudding) were superb, and the management took them off the bill due to the wait we endured. Hope this was just an off night. The ambience is meh--a large echoing space, could use a few tapestries or rugs on the wall, lights at the non-booth tables, and a touch of decoration. But I'll be back for the pukka food."}
{"text":"Ilike this place because the chef is from a restaurant I went to regularly in our city. This is their new venture. The buffet is the one I went twice and it's a great place maintained by a lovely couple. The food is amazing but the restrooms are my complaint. Try their goat curry."}
{"text":"Good food, friendly staff. We got the lunch buffet, lots of options. Clearly marked vegan, veg, gluten free and meat. Just passing through but would come back if I pass this way again."}
{"text":"Ah, there is a plethora of Indian/Pakistani restaurants. How to choose? My experience is that each restaurant has its strengths and weaknesses. Service and culinary expertise changes with each visit or delivery. To me the one exception is Swad, which is \"steady as she goes\". I know what I like and I can count on what each dish will taste like. No surprises.

My Pakistani guy loves OM and we have eaten in the restaurant and have had take-out. OM has a very eclectic menu. Dishes are Indo-Chinese, South Indian and Indian/Pakistani. The staff is very warm and accommodating. On one occasion the meat in our dish was over-cooked and dry. Not only did our lovely waiter offer to make a new plate, he suggested we try a different dish. The food was fresh, hot and perfectly prepared.

The restaurant itself is sort of tucked away on East Washington, where Shakey's Pizza used to be. It has a no-frills look, but is a clean and service is fine.

Our last take out included my favorite, Baingan Bharta, minced grilled eggplant which is creamy and oh so tasty. We also had the Chettinad with lamb. It was excellent. It had a coconut milk-based masala with mild spices. The take-out was ready when promised and included a large amount of white rice.

I wish I could order brown rice... no such luck at any venue.

If you live on the East side, drop-by and give OM a chance. My guess is you will be quite satisfied."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! 
I haven't eaten much Indian food since I've been in Madison... the great reviews and close proximity to my hood brought me here. 
We dined in on a Friday night, we arrived at 6pm and were surprised at how empty the place was, but we weren't concerned. We were super hungry so we knew our food would likely arrive quickly based on this fact, and that is not a bad thing when your approaching hangry! 
Our server was friendly and offered to answer any questions. The menu is quite large and offers many Indian fusion options so I think this would be a good  choice for those who are not sure about trying Indian food.
I had the garlic nan and Chicken Tikka Masala with basmati rice. They keep your water glass full at all times which I appreciate when I'm eating something with a little heat. My husband tried the Indian fried rice and the portion was bonkers, he brought 1/2 of it home.
The prices are reasonable, the food is yum and they have a pretty substantial bar, the remodel makes this place unrecognizable from it's former sketchy Chinese restaurant. It's my recommendation that you should check his place out ASAP. But really... go now!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, well balanced taste, authentic Indian food. Everything we ordered was well made. Will come back for more!
Biryani was really tasty!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times for the lunch buffet; never once have I left disappointed! There are always a variety of delicious dishes to choose from that are fresh and refilled frequently. The buffet is always clean and service is always friendly and fast. I love coming here! My favorites include masala chai, chicken tikka (of course), anything with paneer, and the naan--do not skip the naan! It delicious!"}
{"text":"Authentic Indian food. We stopped by, during a road trip for dinner and loved the authentic South Indian food available. Impressed by the selection, stopped by again on our way back home for lunch (Glad we did!) Lunch Buffet has a huge selection of dishes to select from. And to top it all - Great service as well! 
There are no second thoughts of recommending this place to all who wanna try some good Indian food .."}
{"text":"Excellent service and delicious food!!  Clean fresh flavors that satisfy. Even our picky eater loved the food."}
{"text":"Gorgeous modern decor and very kid-friendly. They even have a 6'x6' area partitioned off with toys etc. menu has all the classic Indian dishes and kids menu options are great. I recommend Khorma with lamb. Service from the owner was very friendly and attentive. Cocktails--yum.

Fancy enough to be a date night restaurant, but totally fine if you want to go casual as well.

Neighboring businesses are pretty sketch, but parking is well lit and area immediately around the building is safe.

Tip--ask the owner to make you an Old Fashioned. He has it down to a science."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since my husband and I have been as impressed by restaurant food as we were during our visit here.  The food here is definitely the best Indian food we've had!!! The green chile appetizer is coated in a fried chickpea batter and covered in a thick layer of well flavored veggies.  It was truly amazing.  We also shared the kadai curry and were equally impressed.  I have a gluten allergy and it sounds as if most items are gluten-free.  The servers are quite knowledgeable about the ingredients so it's definitely a great option for people with gluten allergies.  I noticed that the gluten-free lunch buffet items are labeled as such.

Service was extremely friendly and fast.  The interior is also nicely decorated.  

Unfortunately, we live in New Mexico, so we won't be able to come back anytime soon.  However, this will be our go-to place whenever we end up in Madison."}
{"text":"Such a yummy Indian restaurant. Try the Mutter Paneer. Amazing.  The garlic naan is always perfect."}
{"text":"Some friends and I ordered delivery last weekend, and it was wonderful. I ordered the baingan bartha and the chicken tikka masala, both spicy, and they were absolutely delicious. We ordered a huge vegetable dosa, and that was good. The garlic naan was tasty, as well. This week I went in for the buffet, but I was less than impressed. There was no chicken tikka masala (only bland makhani, with very little meat left), no onion chutney, no fresh hot sauce (only Sriracha, etc.), and the tandoori chicken was room temperature (major food safety concern). To be fair, the goat was good. I probably won't be back for the buffet, however, but I would definitely order some entrees again, for dinner or for delivery."}
{"text":"We tried the lunch buffet at OM last weekend and were delighted. 

OM is in a little strip mall right off the high-way. Although not impressive from the outside, once you go in, it's clean, tastefully decorated, and even has a children's area. I even thought the bathroom was tasteful. 

Our server seated us, asked if we wanted beverages, and then we headed to the buffet. On the way, we passed the kitchen where you can see the chefs actually preparing the food.

I like Indian buffets because I like to try a little of a lot of things. OM surprised us with dishes and flavors we have not see at other buffets in the area. I enjoyed the breaded and fried plantain. The tandoori chicken which is always a favorite for me, somehow had more flavor and was much juicier than usual. The flavors in the both the vindaloo and the tikka masala which are my defaults just seemed more intense and complex. Even the rice seemed particularly good. For dessert I had the gulab jamun and the kheer which again are my defaults. Again these seemed better than other buffets. The gulab jamun was bigger and lighter w/a sweeter sauce. The rice pudding was smoother and the cardamom really stood out. I was really impressed with the food. The only down-side for me, is that there were more dishes w/the bone-in, but maybe that's where the better flavor comes from.

The service was also very good at OM. They were constantly there to replenish our water. While at the buffet we were discussing what a couple of dishes might be and one of the managers overheard us and kindly explained what was in each dish.

We'll definitely go back to OM."}
{"text":"Went for the weekend lunch buffet.  Very underwhelmed.  Where was the tikka masala?  Some dishes on the buffet were empty and not refilled for the duration of our time there.  Many vegetarian dishes but at 13 bucks a plate, show me some meat dishes.  Only two creamy rice dishes for dessert. They were both tasteless and quite icky.  The young man who seated us was terribly pleasant and made sure our plates were cleared in a timely manner.  Nice, minimalist decor. Up the quality and value and favors and it could be a hit."}
{"text":"We came all the way from the west to try this place. I wasn't so impressed with their service and the food wasn't extraordinary. For a weekend buffet, their variety was limited. The description says it's grill salmon and it was actually tilapia or a white fish. We were there around 2. The buffet items were minimal. We ordered Indian tea and it came warm. It wasn't hot at all. I told the server and he didn't care to rectify it. Didn't even hear a sorry. 

I wont travel for this place. I sure am not planning to come again. It says fusion and I was intrigued to try what's different. Nothing was. It was the same Indian food. The name was deceiving. If u are looking for an ordinary Indian buffet and live around the area, u might want to go try this place. 

I usually look forward to Indian deserts- but there's were certainly disappointing. My gulab jamun were actually salty inside which was nothing I have tasted before. I liked the vermicelli dish. If I would have gotten a hot tea-the flavor was good but of course I couldn't enjoy mine as well."}
{"text":"The fifth star is for the tandoori, which is the most succulent and flavorful I've ever had."}
{"text":"I've been hearing mixed reviews about OM but wanted to given the focus on Southern Indian cuisine. My dinner guest and I arrived around 6:30pm on a Saturday night and were were quickly seated but were told that it could take 40 minutes to get our meal.  The place was packed, which was a great sign, so we decided to take a table. We were quickly given some water and our order was taken.  Everyone around us all arrived around the same time as well.  Then the wait.  We were famished when we arrived so we ordered some appetizers hoping they would come out quick.  We look around and everyone else did the same. It was about an 45 minutes until we even got our appetizers, which was a samosa (which shouldn't have taken that long to make).  In other Indian restaurants a small plate of chutneys, sauces and some papadum would have immediately come out. In OM's case--nothing but water and drinks for the entire time we waited and waited. But once our food came out, it was well worth the wait in despair.  The samosa was spiced so well I knew we were in for a dinner treat.  I have never tasted such quality just in the samosa. Then as other Yelp reviewer mentioned, we got the Merchi Bajji (which was amazing!). I have never had them but I would say they are an Indian version of jalapeño poppers but way better!  This is a must get appetizer here. We then got our main courses soon after which consisted of Butter Chicken, Tandoori Shrimp and Aloo Ghobi. All with unbelievable flavor! Each dish was complex and rich in flavor and I suspect was due to the attention paid to the spice blends and toasting of their components.  The Tandoori shrimp was cooked to perfection and the squeeze of lime just hit it out of the park.  The Aloo Ghobi was complex in flavor given how simple the dish actually is.  I loved the Butter Chicken and was as good as I have gotten in the UAE. However, the dish was riddled with very, very small chicken bones which made the dish very hard to eat. Overall, OM is very, very good but they need to figure out some inexpensive snack to give to people the second they get a table. The hour wait without a little munchie or appetizer was way too long.  This simple change will make everyone happy including the other tables and screaming kids all around us. Maybe having a saturday dinner buffet would solve this problem.  I highly recommend with even the long wait as it was totally worth it. Very high quality well made food.  Luckily they have delivery, so I suspect calling ahead is a good idea.  If they add a snack while you wait, I'd change my 4 starts to 5."}
{"text":"Om=Yum! A friend and I went at lunch. I arrived pretty much right at noon and there were people there but lots of open places...by 12:25 there was a line! The majority of the clientele were from India, which seemed like a good sign. We did the lunch buffet, and both had homemade chai. Everything I tried was well spiced, flavorful but not too spicy to enjoy. A couple items were hot, but still had good flavor, not just heat.  They also didn't just have the same things every other Indian place serves. There were several new things I hadn't tried before. 

Also, there is a kid-friendly area, with a chalkboard and some books, making this a very family place. Definitely not too fancy, but very nice. I wouldn't hesitate to come back...and since this place is like a mile from my house."}
{"text":"Om is fantastic on so many levels!  My husband is from India, so appreciates authentic Indian food with good variety for all types of interests (mild, spicy, southern, buffet, etc.).  The owners are wonderful and the staff attentive.  We love the buffet on weekends with a huge selection.  Our kids always find many things to try and love the mango lassis and chicken tikka masala.  My favorite is the lemon rice!  My husband swears by their rasmali dessert. No regrets and we have eaten here at least 15 times."}
{"text":"OM should stand for OMG delicious food! I had the opportunity to sample many items off of the lunch buffet today and not a single one disappointed! Great atmosphere and very attentive staff! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Indian food restaurants in town.  Originally I went for their buffet.  Overall their use of various spices and having dishes on the buffet that are a little different made it a hit for me.  The buffet was a little to spicy for my taste, my mouth was burning, but others said it was right at the borderline, spicy but not too hot.  I went back and ordered a few dishes with a \"very mild\" spice level and found I really liked it.  I love Swad, but I think I think I like OM even better."}
{"text":"Horrible Experience, both food and customer service sucked. We went there at 3:30 PM on Sunday. The waitress took our order (Masala Dosa, Manchurian with Gravy, Coffee and Mango Lassi). The lassi came on time because it is probably ready, coffee took 45 mins to come. When I asked the waitress about the food, she shouted out to the chef and he said, 'exactly 3 mins!'. Manchurian came 10 mins after that conversation and the big, dry and cold bowl of manchurian was placed on our table. We were hoping that dosa would be good. After another 15 mins, dosa came (it was 4:30 PM by then). The sambar was thick, cold and looked rather like a left over from the morning. There were no napkins and spoons on the table after asking for them twice. 

We were so frustrated with the service and the food, we decided to leave. We talked about this to another waitress who had just come and she coldly said, \" sorry ma'm,  I just got here. I don't know what is wrong. Have a good night btw!\"

The staff and food were horrible. No courtesy to even say sorry, and we traveled all the way from the Wst side because my mother wanted to have dosa. Well, not going there anymore even someone is treating me!"}
{"text":"Wow! I've been driving past this place for the last couple of months and had been meaning to stop by. I went in with the intention of checking out the menu and ended up getting take-out. I wanted to try something new since I've gotten stuck in my Butter Chicken and Tikka Masala world. One of the staff suggested the Methi. I ordered it with the lamb and got a chai tea while I waited. They ended up both being done at the same time and I took the tea to go. When I got home the basmati rice was fluffy and light and oh my goodness was the Methi delicious. So impressed. It's easily my favorite Indian food in Madison. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The flavors of everything I ate were amazing! Had the lunch buffet and was SO GOOD. If you are looking for something different, check this place out! It's on my new list of favorites in the Madison area."}
{"text":"Had the lunch buffet. It was an incredible steal for $11. I will not go into making an attempt to pronounce or spell out the ethnic names of the dishes. Lets just say that the buffet offered fresh fruit, different curries (goat curry was outstanding), veggetables with aromatic spices, and some of the most tastiest sauces that I could literally drink by the gallon. 

I will update this review after I revisit for the dinner menu. We needed fresh vibrant  Indian cuisine in the area. OM, without hesitation, filled the void. 

The interior is modern contempory with spotless stainless steel open kitchen. A very open and airy dining room provides charm and playfulness to the busy environment."}
{"text":"Stopped for the buffet on our way to St. Paul from Chicago. Easy to find off the highway and great food. We love Indian food and eat it quite often. The dishes here were a little different so it was great fun trying new dishes. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here Sunday night while visiting in Madison. Very good food but the atmosphere was more like a family restaurant than a place you go for a nice meal. Lots of noisy kids. I would return but with different expectations.

In response to the owner's response below, I doubt there's much you can do. There were three tables of loud and misbehaved children. Nothing you can do really. We were there near closing and I thought the kids were out a bit late and likely tired and cranky. Maybe have a quieter area for couples without children? We will return because the food was delicious but I'll come in expecting a family restaurant rather than a quiet place where we can talk."}
{"text":"Our group had the buffet lunch and thoroughly enjoyed it. The buffet has good options for vegetarians. The staff is friendly and helpful. I would say it's a tie between this place and Taste of India for best Indian food in Madison. OM had several dishes that I hadn't tasted before, so that was very welcome. The interior design is gorgeous. There is a chalk board area to distract the kids if you bring them along."}
{"text":"OM lives up to its yelp reputation! What a great restaurant! The interior if the restaurant is clean, well-designed, and modern. I will say it does not have the \"cozy\" feel of many other Indian restaurants. Our server, John, was extremely attentive and apologetic because they were quite busy that evening. They clearly did a huge takeout/delivery business which we could see from the line-up of orders along the bar. I mentioned that I was trying to stay away from dairy, and John grabbed their menu which had gluten and dairy call outs on it. It was very helpful in my ordering decision. The food was delicious and they had a great wine deal going where it was $4/glass for house wine. I loved OM and will definitely be back, maybe next time I'll try their delivery option!"}
{"text":"It has the worst hyderabadi dum biryani in Midwest . Don't insult the city's name by giving tomato rice instead of biryani and charging extra price .they charged me 16$ for veg biryani with an egg and gave me tomato rice . I would never recommend this one to any of my Hyderabadi Indian friends."}
{"text":"They're the best Indian food in town these days. Only complaint is that they seem skittish about making making it too spicy."}
{"text":"Nothing good to share about this restaurant.
Horrible taste. Will never try Biryani in this restaurant. House special Biryani: This is not 'House Special Biryani', it is a 'House Hell Biryani'. They charge too much for special items and serve them with worst taste."}
{"text":"Delivery to my home within 2 miles of this restaurant took over an hour and a half with an online order."}
{"text":"We have visited this restaurant twice.  The first time was during Lunch hour, my husband ordered the buffet and was happy. I ordered off of the menu and it was good so we decided to return with our family members.  We had 11 in our party, I called ahead for reservations and pre warned them I had 5 children with me ages 4-10.  The lady that answered the phone said she would seat us by the children's area. We show up at our scheduled reservation time to find that they did not have a table set for us nor was it even close to the children's play area.  We where seated at 6:10pm. We ordered drinks and appetizers.  The appetizers came out in a timely manner our drinks where another story.  We ordered Chai and it took over 40 minutes to get our drinks.  We ordered an Alfredo dish for our kids and after 30 minutes of waiting we where told that they where out of the sauce and we needed to order something else. We waited in total 1.5 hours for our main food to arrive.  We watched people come and sit at the bar and get served before us.  The taste and quality of the food is great but they really need a manager to keep things on pace.  We will not be returning because of the disorganization and wait time."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night with friends. Had onion bajji, chicken lollypop, kulcha, and vegetable chettinaad. Bajji and chettinaad were the best. Other two were okay, not too good and not that bad either. Enjoyed the dinner. Service was good too.."}
{"text":"For my first visit to OM Fusion I ordered carryout via EatStreet. The confirmation message said the food would be ready in 20 minutes. I arrived 5 minutes after the expected pickup time and was told that they were running late due to Valentine's Day. I received the food after waiting in the restaurant for an additional 35 minutes.

The food was fine, and I realize restaurants sometimes have staffing problems. But, it would have been nice to either get an accurate estimated pickup time, or an apology gift, such as a % off the next visit.

One star for the long wait, not the food."}
{"text":"Love this place. They have your typical Indian Fare and dishes with more flare. The flavors are incredible. Can't wait to go back the next time I am in town."}
{"text":"We chose Om out of all the places available in Madison based on the glowing reviews. We went at lunch, and the waiter really pushed the buffet. I wanted vegetarian food, and the waiter seemed so disappointed when we asked for a menu, so against my better judgement judgment we chose the buffet. I wish I hadn't. The food was average at best, and when the steamer trays ran out no one refilled them so the vegetarian choices were limited. The saag paneer literally had zero cheese in it. We left feeling dissatisfied and wishing we had just gone somewhere for a salad instead."}
{"text":"Finally got to revisit OM Fusion and was not impressed. First and foremost is the fact my partner and I could not eat at least half of the food because it was way to spicy HOT! Even the soup, which looked harmless was over the top. The goat curry was another. We ended up eating rice and chicken masala which was very good and mild. The rest ended up uneaten on our plates. I don't see any other  reviews that mention this but trust me, I like a little heat but not at this level. Another odd thing was a large container between the salad bowls and the desert table. It was filled to the brim with a mix of something that I couldn't begin to describe but it was not pleasant to look upon. There was no sign to explain what it was and no-one , as far as I could see, touched it. A mystery.  Maybe this buffet is representative of some region of India that like really hot food. There were lots of customers there. Maybe it was just us. Anyway, we didn't eat much and have taken this restaurant  off our list of places to go. None of the other Indian buffets make everything so hot that you can't eat it. The place is still beautiful and the service was very good but we will not be back. I only give it two stars because we couldn't eat most of what was on the buffet. Not saying it was bad, just to hot for us."}
{"text":"I loved my experience at this restaurant. Vegan and vegetarian friendly!! I am kind of a rookie when it comes to Indian food but I really loved everything they had to offer. I also took my friend there(who has never had Indian food before), and she was impressed by how great everything was.

We were very pleased with the service(except for this lady but oh well you can't please everyone). One of the servers brought us an appetizer and he talked to us about it and what it was made out of, and just overall the restaurant. He was very nice! Also when it was time to give and take our check, the service was very fast.

I think my favorite part though, as a vegetarian who is looking to become vegan, was that every dish was labeled. Most of their options were actually vegetarian, and gluten free, and of course they had some chicken and other meat too. I was soooo excited when I saw all the vegan dishes. It's like I was in heaven. 

Overall, I had a wonderful lunch and will definitely return!"}
{"text":"It's consistently delicious. They continue to have so many South Indian specialties you don't see on menus anywhere else in town. Everything tastes fresh. The bread is top notch."}
{"text":"This was one of my worst experiences at a restaurant ever.  The food was good but the service was abysmal.  

When we arrived, it was about 6pm on a Saturday night.  A few of the tables were reserved, but there were plenty of open tables, and we were seated right away.  About five minutes after we got there, someone dropped off glasses of water for us, but didn't say anything.  It took another five minutes for our waitress to get to our table.  We were hungry and had had 10 minutes to review the menu so we ordered.  That was the last time our waitress gave us a look until it was time for the check. There's just no excuse for that.  It took about a half hour for our appetizer to arrive.  Both the appetizer and dinner were delivered by a nice kid who seemed to work in the kitchen.  Because again, our waitress wouldn't even look at our table. 
 
A man who I presume was the owner was onsite, and floating around, but apparently not moved enough to actually help out his wait staff. If he doesn't want to lift a finger to actually work at his restaurant, then he needs to hire more efficient wait staff.  And train them well.  A good waiter or waitress does not avoid a customer's table for an hour, showing up only when it's time to pay.  

Like I said, it's good food.  But I won't even be back for carryout because I do not want to support a restaurant that so obviously doesn't care about its customers."}
{"text":"Although the food was reasonably adequate, I felt the staff needs to slow down a little when taking and preparing orders. We ordered an appetizer that never ended up on our table despite the fact the appetizer plates were delivered for it. At the end, we were billed for the appetizer which we didn't get...even after alerting the staff to this fact. We also had to ask for more water after our cups were empty for 15 minutes.  As this is my first visit to this place, I would give them the benefit of the doubt, but I would recommend that customers keep an open eye on their orders and make sure that the staff and the chef are on the same page in terms of what has been ordered. We came during a holiday weekend with 4 other tables so maybe they didn't have enough coverage, but I was dissapointed."}
{"text":"(Be warned that I'm not an expert at Indian food, so I'm going to sound like a noob)

I've been on a quest to discover my favorite Indian lunch buffet in Madison, and I think I found it. Out of the places I've been to, OM provides the second most variety (Swagat has an even bigger spread), but it wasn't by much. Om still has quite the selection of curries, breads, pakora, biryani, chutneys and things that go well with sambar. You can really try a huge variety of flavors and textures at the buffet if you've got the room for it. If things get too spicy for you, OM also has a variety of desserts including gulab jamun, the sweet fried dough balls soaking in honey and saffron that seem to be a standard at Indian lunch buffets.

In addition to the food being pretty good, the atmosphere is also nice. The place is clean and modern interior with cream-colored walls and dark wood furnitures, but what's really great is the open kitchen. There's something about watching the chefs having fun and applying a variety of techniques with lots of spices that gets me appetized and ready to go. To me, this is where OM wins out over the other buffets.

Personally, I found the buffet food to not be spicy enough for my pain-loving, masochistic tongue, so I got some biryani for take out on a separate occasion. I ordered the house special biryani at maximum spiciness. This was great! It was tangy and spicy with every meat under the sun including steak, goat, lamb, shrimp and eggs. The complex spiciness was mellowed out with refreshing coriander, lime, and raita. Another thing that stood out to me was the shrimp; they were jumbo, sweet, and cooked to perfection. They definitely didn't throw in some pre-peeled and pre-cooked stuff.

While I still miss going to Indian restaurants on Devon in Chicago, I love eating from OM, and they'll be my Indian restaurant of choice going forward."}
{"text":"I was so glad i went here! I walked in about 15 min before the lunch buffet ended and they were kind enough to extend it for me. I truly appreciated that. They have a ton of vegetarian options and even more dessert options. My waiter was very kind and attentive. The food was delicious and the best part of all, the buffet was ONLY 10$!!! The beer was expensive though. A large taj Mahal is normally 6 everywhere ive gone but it was 8 here. Anyways, 10/10 would recommend!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!! We had the fried paneer appetizer, spinach chicken, butter chicken, and carrot pudding dessert. We were making yum sounds the entire meal and can't wait to go back! Fantastic meal! Delicious sauces that went with the appetizer, as we could have eaten a bowl of them just by themselves. My daughter thought she didn't like Indian food and now everything is different for her. She was so happy to have such new experiences and delicious flavors."}
{"text":"Good south Indian food.
Nice menu, the dosas were delicious. (Chutneys were average, probably was an off day) nice ambience but gets bit noicy at times."}
{"text":"I am a non-Indian who has eaten Indian food all over the world (including in India), I can honestly say this is one of the best places I've been to. I had the navrattan korma and my wife had a dosa, both were excellent. This restaurant is now bookmarked in our favorites."}
{"text":"Very delicious food at reasonable prices! 

However, I would strongly encourage all to get take-out. Although the atmosphere is lovely inside, the service is less than ideal. For dinner, we had entrees take unreasonably long, come out at different times, and had to constantly remind our server of everything that we were still waiting for. After a 2-hour fiasco, we finally got our orders of naan (an hour after 4 of 5 of us got our entrees, and 20 minutes after one person got their meal). Our server was apologetic and gave us a heavy discount for trouble - and rightfully so. Om is not the place to go if you are already really hungry or are in a hurry. 

Nevertheless - the food was incredible and I hope we just caught Om on a bad night because I hope restaurants like Om will continue to take a chance on the East Washington corridor."}
{"text":"We decided to check out Om Indian Fusion Cuisine last minute and it turned out to be a good decision. The variety of dishes they have are amazing - they have different dishes from all parts of India which great especially if everyone wants to try something different. We ordered a few different dishes: Chicken tikka, Kashmiri Palao, and onion rava dosa. The chicken was delicious and cooked perfectly. The Kashmiri Palao was something we had never had. It was more on the sweet side which I usually don't like for a main dish but still very tasty. The rava dosa was really delicious and very aromatic from the minute the dish was on our table. 
We also tried some of the drinks. We tried the sweet, salty, and mango lassi. The salty lassi was a bit too salty for my taste. The sweet lassi according to my mom tasted like it was homemade. The best was the mango lassi. Our server did tell us the Lassis are made from scratch. 
The service was great, and overall it was a great experience. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to try Indian food. Definitely will be back again!"}
{"text":"At the risk of being insulted for posting an honest and negative review -- check out the replies to negative reviews below -- here goes:

The decor inside is very nice.  The metal plates are an authentic touch, but I don't enjoy eating off them.  Middle class privilege, I guess.  

The lunch buffet food was decent enough the two times I've eaten here.  Some items were much more spicy than I like in that particular dish, some much less spicy than I like.  I'm a culturally European white guy, so I may not have a clue how these things are supposed to taste, but I eat at Indian buffets a couple times a month and I know what makes me happy.  And I'm the guy eating the lunch.

The service is...well...there isn't any service, really.  Long (L----O----N----G) wait to be seated, long wait to pay the check, long wait for food to be filled on the buffet (whole lunch with no naan bread though I asked for it at the beginning of the meal...) and customers have to go get their own utensils.  It is not unlike eating from a vending machine, except that vending machines are pretty quick.  The last time I came I walked out after waiting to be seated for way (W----A----Y) too long (two other parties there suggested I just sit down and start eating, but that didn't feel right to me).  I drove over to Maharana and had a nice lunch and -- importantly -- felt like a valued guest.  

Maybe the owner of OM will put on a couple more staff members, or perhaps he'll just write a reply insulting my personal life.  We'll see."}
{"text":"Finally a better Indian place in the east side of Madison.. Sad ..They close very early on Sundays.. The food is good and it is different.. It is a must try if you are in East side.."}
{"text":"on our way back from Wisconsin Dells and we felt like some Indian chai. I called the restaurant to see if we can get some and if they were close to the interstate....was promptly informed yes and its only a 5 mile detour. Well worth it!! The owner Nancy was very pleasant understood that we were in a rush, got our chai ready in togo cups and our order of Samosas packed up with plasticware and napkins. The only disappointment was that the lamb samosas actually had potato filling as well..... which is atypical.

Will definitely stop in check out other menu items if we are in the area again!!!"}
{"text":"The buffet has a nice mix of typical Indian buffet fare and stuff you won't see anywhere else in the area. They had a biryani, a goat curry and a couple of other things that were just really delicious. The naan and other fried items were dry from sitting under the buffet lights, and I didn't care too much for the desserts, but the rest of their dishes were excellent. 

They have a little kids play area and kids eat free, so that is a nice bonus."}
{"text":"Our visit was on 3/4/17 around 7pm. The restaurant was not very crowded but since the kitchen is open we could see they were very busy (presumably with to-go orders). Our group of 6 was easily accommodated by pushing some tables together. There is a play area for children, making the restaurant family friendly. As other reviewers have stated, the interior decorations are modern but welcoming. The menu offers something for everyone; there is a very nice selection of vegetarian dishes. Our group ordered the Navratan Korma, Hyderabadi curry, Vindaloo curry, and three other dishes I can't remember the names of (but probably also curries). We also ordered naan and roti. The food took a really long time to arrive, and arrived in 2-3 batches. It was understandable since it was a Saturday night, and I would suggest if you want to dine as a group here on a weekend night to pick an earlier or later time for faster service. The food itself was very good; my favorites were the Vindaloo and Hyderabadi curries (probably why they were among the only dishes I could remember). The difference in spice level between the \"mild\" and \"medium\" was quite significant and also inconsistent...in our group, 2 of us ordered \"medium\" spicy dishes, and one of our dishes was significantly spicier than the other one. I would say the \"mild\" spice level contains little to no heat. The flatbreads (naan and roti) are both made to order, and as a result are very soft and fluffy.

Although the food might take a while to arrive if you happen to be there on a busy night, the open kitchen is interesting to watch. The chefs are clearly very hard at work churning out dish after delicious dish, and it's quite a show to watch. Our servers were as attentive as they could be for how busy it got. I believe our entire dining experience took 2-2.5 hrs from start to finish."}
{"text":"Five stars for the Dal Makhani.  The atmosphere/interior leaves a little to be desired, but the food is pretty great.  I always tell myself I'll order something other than the Dal Makhani with a side of garlic naan, but I doubt it will ever happen.  It is a superb dish, and Om makes it better than any Indian restaurant I've tried; everyone should order it :)  Service is great here as well."}
{"text":"Went for the lunch buffet last week and we're thoroughly impressed by the food. They had a great variety of meat and vegetable based items, various spice levels, and all were piping hot. The owner was very welcoming and appreciative of our choice to dine there. The interior is a beautiful calming space and they would have gotten five stars if not for the ridiculously cold temperature inside. I'm hoping that was just a fluke, as we ate our entire meals huddled up with our coats on, which is never desirable. 

Here's hoping I've found my new favorite Indian restaurant in town!"}
{"text":"This was our pit stop from Minnesota to Illinois. We were very hungry so I am sure anything would've tasted fabulous. But we were disappointed at our first trip here. 
We got someone else's food and our's must've gone to someone else as when our dish arrived it was cold. 
My son ordered a cone dosa which was good. We ordered the sizzler platter which did not sizzle as it was cold. We had ordered naan which arrived after we asked for it. Almost after the meal was over. We did get a complimentary apple shake in the interim which was good.
I wish there were more servers. The food was average. We will not come back."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying OM. I ordered vegetable samosas, naan, and chicken tikka masala. Cons: I ordered delivery, which took 1.5 hours to arrive, even though I only live 4 minutes from the restaurant. Maybe I'll try pick up next time, but I didn't feel like getting out of my pjs. The naan and rice were cold. Pros: everything had good flavor. I'll admit that I don't know much about Indian food, but I liked everything I had. Overall, I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I'll start with... the food was really good.  Overall, I'd give it a solid, very good rating on the food taste.  However, one would expect that when there are 7 customers in the restaurant total, and we were 3 of them.  On that note, it took an extraordinary long time to get our food.  And, the wait for food wasn't the worst of the waiting.  The customer service and the waaaaaiiiiitttt, and then wait some more, seemed to be the primary theme here.  On one final note, there was a woman with white hair and a very gruff demeanor working here doing bussing, clean-up, etc.... and she came over picked one of our drink cups (refilled w/ water) by the rim after she was touching the broom and just picked up items off the floor.  It's too bad the service was just so poor here, because the food would have been worth returning for."}
{"text":"The service is really bad here, first we waited more than 30mins to get our food, and in the meantime, no one came to apologize. And we ordered five dishes and three naanes, and they only came with three bowls of rice and no naan, and we had to ask for the naan and rice, and they only brought one piece of naan after like 10mins, we almost finished everything at that time and didn't need the extra naan already. Really disappointed..."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service and fantastic experience 
Highly recommend anyone who love Indian & Vegetarian food!!"}
{"text":"Delicious!! Tried everything on the Buffet and my mouth was so happy. Get down here ASAP and check this place out. Best Indian food in Madison, and the service is spot on."}
{"text":"I decided to try agin with family after almost a year(almost when it opened), given some of the positive reviews of late.
We tried the non-veg appetizer sampler, Chile masala and biriyani. Appetizer sample was the smallest you will find on this side of Lake Michigan in an Indian restaurant, the seeks kebabs were actually brittle (believe that!) and spicy as hell, which hides the lack of other masalas while the chicken legs were hard to munch on. Biriyani actually had semi-sticky rice!!!! 
Staff was very courteous but giving stars for that would dilute honest review of the food!!
With Fast Biriyani closed down, avoid Indian restaurants on the East side as no good one left!!!!"}
{"text":"The best Indian restaurant in Wisconsin!! Make sure you talk to the chef to get your dishes customized as per your taste. Only drawback is it's higher prices"}
{"text":"OM!     Wonderful new addition to Madison's restaurant choices!  ~Enjoyed a delicious meal with a cold Kingfisher.   ~Someone else in our party had the mango lassi.  All entrees were delicious.  
Great space, clean, quick and very attentive service.  We had the pleasure of meeting the owner.  
I can't wait to return.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Had the lunch buffet today at Om and everything was incredible! Tons of options, plenty of both meat and vegetarian dishes and everything tasted fresh and well-seasoned. Our server and the other staff at Om were friendly and attentive, always asking if we needed more drinks or how the food at the buffet was tasting. 

Even though the restaurant seemed packed at the buffet line, the dining area felt comfortable and spacious thanks to some thoughtful design choices and plenty of natural sunlight coming in through the restaurant's ample front windows. 

If you're looking for a delicious lunch option for a good price and full of authentic southern Indian food, check out Om. Though I haven't tried it just yet, I'm sure their dinner options will be just as amazing!"}
{"text":"New Indian restaurant serving really good Indian food with an South Indian flair to it, very similar to home style Indian cooking. We stumbled upon this after we found the other Indian place was closed on Monday, and we were surprised. The chef has worked previously in Indian and Italian establishments and hence you would be surprised to see some Italian dishes popular in the US. The chapati beard stole the show hands down. It was super fresh sans any char marks and blemishes.

Just FYI they do have a well stocked bar.

We will definitely visit here whenever in town!"}
{"text":"Was very impressed with the food. We ordered Butter Chicken and Saag Paneer. The Saag was puréed which was new to me. The Butter Chicken was delightful. Very good, high quality meat too. The naan we ordered had onion and perhaps cilantro. 

Definitely give this place a shot! Best Indian I've had recently in Madison."}
{"text":"This was very good, authentic Indian food, especially for the price. I went here because many coworkers were recommending it, and it had good reviews online. The service was great - upon walking through the front door, the hostess welcomed us and immediately offered lassi or chai tea. 

The atmosphere was also good, both modern and cozy with a fireplace, a few lounge chairs, regular table seating, and comfy booths.The kitchen was also easily visible from the dining area, so you can see your food prepared as you wait. 

The best part was the food - very yummy. I tried the lassi, which tasted just like I remembered as a kid, along with a creamy paneer dish. 

On a side note, I also noticed a cute corner play area for children, which was pretty thoughtful. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place was great. We visited for Valentine's Day. It has a nice atmosphere, very clean and the food is very tasty!

The have a vegan/vegetarian menu which has a ton of food on it. Our waiter was kind and attentive.

It's a little difficult to get to their parking lot, and the layout of the restaurant itself is a little wonky. Over all A!"}
{"text":"They should add a \"G\" to the end of the OM.  Ironically we went to a different restaurant but didn't want to wait 45 minutes.  So we thought we would try this place as it had great Reviews for the food.  I would say the restaurant was about 3/4 full of customers.  I noticed they had a full bar with one customer sitting in that area.  

We had a small wait to get seated and then it was about 15/20 minutes before we put our order in.  We ordered mango lassee's  and were told it would be a bit as they had to make a new batch up.  I am glad we ordered them Because we were getting hungry and these were filling with their creamy yogurt and sweet mango mix.

We ordered the spinach naan and were hoping that it would come next giving us something to munch on while waiting for our entre'.  But, that wasn't the case.  

We received our Spinach Naan and it was warm and very tasty and fresh.  The chicken curry dish was well received and had a very aromatic flavor.  The Singapore Noodle dish was flavorful with an Asian flavor and a hint of Indian on the chicken incorporated into the dish.  About 3/4 of the Noodle dish went home for two more meals.

We laughed a little as we were waiting for our food because as we checked the clock we realized we would probably been almost done eating if we had waited 45 minutes for a table at the first restaurant we went to.

The food in this restaurant is worth the wait though and we will be back.  It was a bit cool in the restaurant so we kept our jackets on.  I loved their metal plates, water cups and Serving dishes.

I also checked out the bathroom and it was very clean which is a thumbs up in my book."}
{"text":"Great Indian restaurant on the east side. Food is very tasty and fresh. It's very family friendly with a play area. Service was the downside - there was only one waitress for the entire restaurant and bar. They could clearly use more help during peak hours. I waited quite a while for the waitress to stop by my table after I sat down when there were only 4 tables seated and it took about 20 minutes to check out."}
{"text":"OM gets the award for having the best food in the worst location.  Way to rise above, because once you get inside those doors, you won't be thinking of anything but the food.  I have visited for both dinner and lunch buffet, and both visits knocked my socks off.  

Most recently, I visited for the $9 lunch buffet (cheaper for vegetarians), and I was surprised to see almost nothing I recognized.  This is Southern Indian food, and although they do offer tikka, they had an amazing green bean dish, a potato dish, and even crabs (that one was a bit dubious about).  The desserts...there was one similar to bread pudding, and I could have gone back for thirds.  

The dinning area is very trending looking, and they have a fireplace with seating.  I think it would be great for groups.  Very approachable Indian food, and the staff was great."}
{"text":"One of the best Indian food in Milwaukee. If you are planning to visit Wisconsin Dells, hold on to your hunger and drive an hour to this Indian restaurant. Very hospitable staff, you will be served in Stainless Steel plates (quite authentic Indian).. Paneer was fresh, Tasty pakoras.. We ordered 2 paneer dishes(Paneer tikka, Methi Paneer) both  dishes were awesome. I will highly recommend this place for Madison people and people who savor Indian food. Going back very satisfied :)"}
{"text":"I was very impressed with the new design of the space.  There is the buffet as you enter the space, then in the dining room there are booths, tables, a child's play area, and comfy chairs by a fireplace.  It is very beautiful.  The serving wear is all metal and it lends to an air of sophistication.

We had missed the buffet ( so that is just another reason to come back).  The menu is deep and inviting.  I ordered the goat curry which was one of the best I have had in the Madison area.  My friends had veggie curries which they both really enjoyed.  The naan was very good on the first day and the next day too.  I really look forward to coming back and trying more.

Our first server was not very knowledgeable about the menu but he called over another man who could answer my friend's questions.  This man took over for all our service and he was very good."}
{"text":"Om has done a splendid job in ironing out the kinks since my last experience. I know better than to judge a restaurant by its buffet, but my last visit warrants a review. First of all, Om is one of the few Indian restaurants that has a great contemporary decor (like seriously, enough with the elephants and palanquins already!). The maitre D has a gracious smile, you would be surprised how much it matters to be greeted with a smile. Their buffet selection was novel and not your typical run-of-the-mill orange tikka masala. I even noticed a few items I have never seen on an Indian buffet. When I told them they were running low on naan (now this near closing time) we were promptly served warm naan at our table - twice! The silverware was chic and  inviting (the tea cups specially - I do have a weakness for steel utensils, what Indian wouldn't?) The spice palate was slightly leaning to south Indian cuisine, and thats alright. You cant expect the cornucopia of Indian flavors to be captured in one buffet. I take away one star honestly because I haven't tried their a la carte yet, and am hoping that they will out do themselves."}
{"text":"Is OM my favorite new restaurant in Madison? Our visit was pretty grand and the food was AMAZING!

I'm not sure what the place was before OM, but they renovated the whole place and it is very sleek and modern now. They use metal plates and cups, which I thought was a little strange at first, but it was actually quite cool.

The menu is huge and has a lot of variety compared to other Indian restaurants. There were a lot of dishes I didn't recognize, but they all sounded great. Lots of vegetarian options!!!

Our waitress helped us choose a few items, including a Masal Dosa, Aloo Gobi, and punugulu. Of course we ordered too much food (it's really easy to do that here) and had a take home box.

We had great service and I'm pretty sure the manager for the night was the owner. He visited our table several times and asked us how the food was, if we liked the restaurant, etc. 

We'll be back for sure; it was a great experience! I'd say this place is the best Indian in Madison after visiting all of them."}
{"text":"Got there around 2:30. Seemed like we were pushed to the buffet.  The food was cold.  Nice selection.  Would definitely suggest ordering off the menu.  Service was ok."}
{"text":"I've traveled to Madison quite often over the past few years from CA but I've always stayed near the capitol. This time I needed to stay closer to the airport so I picked a hotel close by to Om Fusion Cuisine. Being from CA and being Indian myself, I was exceedingly impressed with the quality of the food from Om Fusion. I ordered delivery because I just didn't have the energy to leave my hotel room and not only was the service and delivery time perfect, the food was amazing. I cannot believe how big the portions are. Maybe it's because I live in the Bay Area, but I was astounded at the massive amount of rice provided for me for just one entree!! I ordered the Paneer Tikka and the Malabar Fish Curry. Both were excellent, not oily or greasy or overly salty like at other Indian restaurants. It's a shame that it was only me because the meal lasted for over 3 days for me!  The Paneer Tikka came with a choice of Dal Tadka or Chole and I opted for the Dal Tadka. Absolutely fantastic and tasted like something my mom would have made. Thank you Om Fusion for the delicious meal and I hope to stop by next time I'm in Madison to sample more of your delicious cuisine!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Indian restaurants in Madison. They have lots of different food items from their buffet, which I appreciate. They also do a good mix of north and South Indian foods, which can be hard to find in other Indian restaurants around Madison. I love trying out everything in their buffet, but recently we went for dinner. I had the Malabar, which is a Kerala-style curry dish with chicken. That was excellent. However, what really impressed me was the Thalapakattu biryani. I've had a lot of biryani in Madison and this was my absolute favorite. We had it with goat, and I've never been a fan of goat but this goat was amazing. I would definitely come back to eat a goat dish here again. The service was also very nice. We ordered dessert as well which was lovely. The cocktails are also worth having too."}
{"text":"Great food with great variety. This is by far the best india food i came across in madison. Price is decent..try lunch buffet to enjoy variety.."}
{"text":"Om is an amazing restaurant. The outside looks like a dive, but the inside is very nice and the food is wonderful. The prices were very good. The staff were warm and friendly and their suggestions we're spot on. We will definitely be going back there again."}
{"text":"We continue to love this place. Their tika masala sauce, made super spicy, is one of my favorite things right now. I could have that over a large order of rice and be so happy."}
{"text":"Tried OM for the first time today. Placed an order through Yelp and had it delivered to my work. Overall, I was pretty pleased. 

One of the items we ordered wasn't available. They called me to let me know and offered a similar substitution so that was fine. The flaw with ordering online, though, was that it allowed me to choose what time I wanted the food delivered, however, the restaurant couldn't meet that time so it ended up being close to an hour later than I had originally hoped for. I selected 11:35 for delivery, however they said since they don't open until 11:30 it wouldn't be ready until 12-12:30. I didn't check the hours before ordering, but it really shouldn't have given that option if it wasn't actually a feasible time. Oh well. Glitch in the system. 

The food itself was quite tasty. I am still an Indian food novice, so ordering from a menu tends to be a bit of a crap shoot. What I chose was great though, and what my coworker ordered was DELICIOUS. I'll be ordering what she got next. I chose the Makhani. It was very similar to Tikka Masala, which I love, but the spices and flavors seemed a bit muted. My coworker got the Keema Dosa. First of all, it was gigantic. Easily two meals. It was a basically a crepe rolled and filled with ground meat (she had chicken) that was amazingly seasoned and flavorful. They offer this dish with lamb which I can't wait to try. We also ordered a couple Naans, one which was baked with fruit and nuts, very yummy! I tried the Phulka bread which I wasn't really impressed with, but at least now I know what it is! I'm sure it was made properly, it just wasn't my thing.

I definitely plan to try more items and hope to check out their lunch buffet asap!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch buffet first time last Friday and totally disappointed.
- Smell in Restaurent was like an old motel room. You guys really need to work on it, that smell is everywhere. Felt like eating in road side old super eight motel room.
- interior is too dark and it feels like having lunch in some Indian \"Bhojnalay\".
- Quality and the choice of food was very bad, who wants to eat \" Aaloo Gobi\" in restaurant ? 
- I would suggest the owner to go visit \" Swagat\" at west side for once to get an idea about the quality of the food. 
-  For me \" Swad\" was poor so far but after visiting \"OM\" , \"Swad\" is far better."}
{"text":"Love the food and service. Haven't indo chinese food for a long time. It tastes as good as back home. Highly recommend this place"}
