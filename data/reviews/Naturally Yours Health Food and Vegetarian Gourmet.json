{"text":"I am not vegetarian, but, I love this place, and eat here at least once a week.  I have pretty much given up on all other lunch options in the TO financial district.  Great combination of healthy food, taste, value, quality and service.

The only thing I don't like is that they charge 50 cents for using their credit/debit machine."}
{"text":"I work in the PATH and I have been to this place several times in the last  7 months. Straight up, they have the rudest staff I have every encountered in my life. They have no patience and I feel that they cater to rich, old white men. I've gone here to pick up products, because I figured it'd be easier to buy it from here rather than ordering online/going shopping after work, but their products are marked up significantly and have low stock and several products I needed.

All in all, if you're not a fan of shitty customer service, low stock and overpriced products, then stay away from this place. Much healthier options throughout the PATH and  bunch of friendlier places where you can get supplements."}
{"text":"Glad I gave this place another chance...after reading a few other Yelp reviews with major points to their yam burritos, I decided to give Naturally Yours another shot. Steering clear of the Bangkok noodles this time around, I'm glad to report the yam burritos were a delicious combination of sweet, spicy and hearty. The salad dressing was also a nice touch, as well."}
{"text":"Even before I became vegan I was very health conscious. So upon getting job in the downtown core I decided to explore the PATH for food options on days I didn't brown bag it. Lo and behold I found Naturally Yours. I was definitely not expecting to find a heath food store and definitely not one so extensive. (insert shock and awe)

My favourite things about Naturally Yours are:
-cold bar (FAVS- quinoa salad, Oriental tofu, Grilled veggies and chick pea salad)
- daily soups 
- Kombucha!!
- that they post their soups and entrees online
- friendly staff

I usually stroll in here once a week for a small bowl from the cold bar, a soup and a Kombucha. I always feel good about the choices I make here because they fall within my diet so neatly. And the friendly men that run the shop are always being funny and  smiling.

If I could change anything it'd be the prices. I realize the economics of food makes it so that healthier products can be on the more expensive side and that I'm also paying for convenience and quality. However, as much as I love the Kombucha drinks $4 is a bit steep. And if you're not careful the salad bar will literally take your wallet from you. Apart from that, their salad and entree deal is a really good price and so are their soups. I don't usually buy any of the products outside of the food because it's significantly cheaper at any store in Kesington. But if you're in their on a Thursday I'm the crazy lady hogging all the Black Bean soup!"}
{"text":"I love this place a lot, 100% vegetarian which is great!! but that doesn't mean it's 100% healthy or low fat. Some of the food is low fat but not al but overall does taste delicious. My favourite is the Mexican lasagna! VERY GOOD. I also like the vegetarian patties, you can make a meal with it such As a patty, quinoa and cauliflower. MUST TRY VEGETARIAN OR NOT :)"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for their lunch special. Generally it's well priced given the area and they are usually pretty good with portioning. 

My main gripe is the lunch can be hit or miss depending on what you get on certain days of the week. The lasagna and yam burritos were great. Also the soup/salad is pretty good too. 

Stay away from the Bangkok noodles and especially away from the mac and cheese. I assure you there is no actual macaroni in the mac and cheese. It is conchigliette (I think) and cheese and it tasted awful with the strange mixtures of sauces and spices. The portions for the Mac and Cheese were extremely ridiculous too; I remember thinking what a great deal I was getting. I usually soldier through lunches that I find not that tasty but this was a rare occasion where I ate as much as I could muster before throwing more than half the container out."}
{"text":"The staff here, especially the owner are VERY RUDE. I ordered the lentil loaf, and it was very undercooked and completely lacked flavour. When I went to complain (I was very nice about it, I may add) I was shocked at how rude my server was to me. She told me there was nothing they could do if I did not like the food. After I asked to speak to a manager and the manager came out said \"I don't have time for this, if you don't like it, don't come back\"

I have never rated a food place before, but my experience here was SO awful, I had to let other people know how awful the service (and food) was."}
{"text":"I have called this place a few times to ask if they have products available and they're extremely rude on the phone. They don't care about service and act like you're wasting their time. Once, they lied to me on the phone that they didn't carry something, then called me back and said they did have it but admitted they lied because they were busy and couldn't talk. 

Ate the hot food there once. Veggie lasagna - greasy, gross and soggy."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why some people are complaining.  My wife and I are vegetarians and always eat at Naturally Yours when we are in Toronto.  The owner, Tom, and his staff are always very pleasant and helpful and talk to us.  The prices for hot meals are comparable to most fast food places.  In fact $8.50 or so for a hot meal is pretty cheap.  Furthermore  they have a rewards program where after each time you spend $20 you get a card stamped and after 3 stamps you get a hot lunch free.  We've tried most of the hot meals they serve and they are all tasty and fresh.  the kamut flour cinnamon protein biscuits are absolutely delicious.  The food is fresh, healthy, tasty, and reasonably priced.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"2.5 stars. 

Strawberry dressing on the salad of romaine lettuce, shredded carrots, and cucumbers- SO GOOD.  Marinated tomatoes... Yum.  The lentil loaf (mock shepherd's pie) was just so-so.  Given the amount of food you get and the price you pay ($7.75 cash), this place is A-ok!"}
{"text":"Picked up a Mexican Bake for my daughter for lunch. The price of $8.50 including taxes is a competitive price point in the Financial District in First Canadian Place. Just across from this store is the Meatless and Wheatless wonder K&K, where almost nothing is below $10 plus taxes. 

I paid $2 extra for a non leafy salad which seemed a bit. Ore to pay for the upgrade as the leafy iceberg lettuce salad would have wilted. But the quantity is plenty. 

The Mexican Bake is some rice and red kidney beans, carrots green peppers. The Brown Rice and bean tasted like the Jamaican Rice and Peas. The spices and all bought memories of Jamaican food, though not exact it was a replica. The topping of cheese, carrots, green peppers was a thin layer and when mixed the rice not enough. The two salads I took were the Broccoli slaw and sweet potato salad. The slaw was OK and lacked flavour and the creamy mayonnaise was too less as well. The sweet potato salad was spot in in flavour and spice. 

The quantity was good and quality was good, however the main dish lacked overall flavour. That being said, would give them a try and see if other dishes are better"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in my hot lunch today. 

The 'roti' was actually a tortilla; it was filled with some heated chick peas (I could tell by their texture that they had been dried) sauteed onions, and large chunks of potato. An insubstantial amount of food, and not well cooked or seasoned. The optional 'chutney' was a soupy substance that they poured over the entire meal. 
For salad, I was told by the lady at the counter that I would have a choice of cous cous, greens or one other-- the woman serving me didn't ask me, just gave me greens. For dressing I chose the vinaigrette, which was gelatinous in texture and they put WAY WAY WAY too much on. Tomatoes on my salad were mushy. 

This meal came to $7.75. Not impressed. 

For this awful1-star experience, I am taking back a star from my previous review! I'll be sticking with the empenadas and salads from now on, fo sho."}
{"text":"I have recently changed my diet to a much more healthier one: low glycemic index one. One day, the sweet desire of croissants and muffins was too much to handle, so I came here to try one of their fiber muffins. The fiber muffins contain too many ingredients to remember off the top of my head, but it includes minerals, anti-oxidants, amino acids, spelt.

It tasted like a dry brick. I don't care how healthy it is supposed to be, it did not taste well.

I still can't muster the courage to try their lunches. I probably should, but that muffin was enough deterrent for me.

I have also purchased my natural supplements here. It's alright b/c it's near work but I much prefer going to a Noah's or other store in the Yonge St Clair or Kensington Market area."}
{"text":"i'm conflicted by this place. on one hand, as a vegan, i'm grateful for options but on the other hand, with IQ, K&K and Freshii around, I have high expectations. their hot food section usually has oily and heavy food. most of it is vegan but not healthy. 

i do like the grocery section but it is very overpriced. a bottle of coconut water that i usually buy for $4 is $9 here! despite the markup, its good to have a place like this wher can pick up vegan staples such as quinoa and vitamins."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I'm not a vegetarian. However, these vegeratian meals are very healthy.

Hot lunch item + salad comes out to $7.75. The portions are generous, and the ingredients are high quality.

There are 4 or 5 hot table items that change daily.

My favourites:

- Sweet Potato Quinoa Pie (pieces of apples inside are delicious)
- Chick pea rotis
- Zucchini Lasagna
- Yam Burritos
- Greek Tart

I don't normally like salad dressing, but the strawberry dressing is amazing.

The empanadas are good, love the latkes.

Daily soups are excellent.

If I worked a bit closer, I would eat here almost every day."}
{"text":"Eating healthy in the financial district can be a challenge. I'm not a vegan or vegetarian but my options for healthy eating are slim pickin'. Very often, if I'm craving a snack or if my lunch wasn't satisfying enough, I come here. 

Naturally Yours recently expanded their store and moved into a new location, and you can find a good variety of naturally-made and organic products. Mind you, I don't shop at here for their bulk items and store products. I find their prices to be too expensive, especially when I could get the same thing for less at another store, or better yet, at Essence of Life. However if I desperately need to stock up on a package of chia seeds, quinoa cereal and natural made toiletries, Naturally Yours will save the day.

My main reason for shopping here is their fresh baked breakfast scones ($1.80), cookies ($1.80), and salads. Ok, really it's just for their scones. I love them so much! They're giant-sized and keep me full for a while. They're made with spelt and kamut, and they make different kinds too, like blueberry, mango, strawberry or chocolate chip. These scones are very popular and they bake about a bazillion of them in the morning. 

As for their salads, they've got quinoa, wheat berry, grilled veggies, moussaka and vegetarian lasagne; all of them are just delicious and reasonably priced given the area. 

Something to keep in mind: for debit purchase costing less than $8, they apply a 50 cent surcharge."}
{"text":"Went in there on a whim a couple of months ago (should have gone to Ho Shim instead).  Anyhow, seriously, seriously overpriced and really, to be totally honest here, tasted like \"healthy food\".  I felt as though I was eating hay.  Bought a muffin as well for dessert (thought I'd \"splurge\") and it was heavy, not well-cooked and I ended up throwing out what I had bought.  Do not like the food at this place at all."}
