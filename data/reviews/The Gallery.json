{"text":"August 12, 2016. My husband and I had dinner here for our 10th anniversary and the staff went out of their way to add special touches to help make our dining experience extra memorable. They always create a great menu that incorporates seasonal and some local ingredients and the chefs do a fine job of executing great dishes!"}
{"text":"First time at The Gallery. We had just eaten and wanted to find a place to grab coffee. It's nearly impossible to find a place to sit and enjoy coffee and have a conversation with friends after 7 in Charlotte. We stumbled upon this place and were totally wowed! Very chic place, great cappuccino and teas. They even have Wine tasting! This place was really unique and in a great spot for Charlotte. COMING BACK!"}
{"text":"Very lovely setting, open space great for conversations and meeting new people over discussions of the art work on the walls. I enjoyed the meat and cheese board and Lady M cakes. The food was tasty and cakes were unique!"}
{"text":"One of the few places in Charlotte that brings me back again and again for dessert. A very artsy atmosphere (maybe because of the all art hanging on walls, derp!) which sometimes makes me question whether I'm hip enough to be frequenting there! This time I had a good sized charcuterie plate with wine and ended my visit with the LadyM Signature Mille Crepe Cake. There are other flavors, but the Signature \"takes the cake\", HAR DEE HAR HAR! The owner was super nice to us and even made us a sample raclette plate...I'll be sure to order that on the next visit!"}
{"text":"This morning was my first visit to Gallery, . I have been wanting to check it out. There was only one other customer.  It is cool concept, interestingly and tastefully decorated    However I ordered a large Americano and asked for extra room. I paid and gave a very generous tip. I then realized they gave me a medium cup rather than a large cup only filled half full. There was no creamer available so I had to ask for some half-and-half. The server poured the half-and-half into a tiny  pitcher about one ounce size. I poured that into my cup and asked for more, she again filled the tiny pitcher. I looked into my 3/4 full medium cup shook my head and walked out. Is it too much to ask to just get a full cup of coffee for $4.25?    I'm afraid unless they get a handle on their customer service this place will not survive."}
{"text":"This is my happiest place  on earth.  At least in Charlotte.  Ana is the biggest personality in Charlotte."}
{"text":"This place is my new favorite coffee/dessert place in Charlotte!  The Gallery serves Stumptown coffee, Lady M cakes, hors d'oeuvres, and more!  Staff is very family oriented and friendly.  Eating cakes and drinking coffee surrounded by beautiful artwork is my new favorite hobby thanks to the Gallery!"}
{"text":"I am generally not a dessert person but I appreciate the perfect dessert every once in awhile and let me tell you, they have it.  They carry Lady M cakes, and if you have not had a slice yet, you are missing out. Highly recommend!  They have a nice wine selection that is reasonably priced.  On Friday nights they have DJs, and it is extremely loud, as the building itself is pretty tiny, but I enjoy listening to music of all kinds so for me this place is a unique little spot that I will frequent often!  I do have to highlight one complaint, as I have been here 3 times with hopes of trying the green tea crepe cake and it has been out of stock each time.  Fourth times a charm?"}
{"text":"While wasting time before my. Flight I found this place on Yelp. Loved the ambiance and the specially crepe cake. I'll be back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"The Gallery is a mold-breaker, and a fresh new addition to the South End neighborhood. Charlotte is filled with many \"me too\" coffee and dessert shops, but no other place South End presents The Gallery's truly unique point of view. Part art gallery, part bakery, part wine bar, and part quiet brunch spot, The Gallery mixes the best of all of these attributes with a clean, tasteful presentation, excellent service, exciting art, and delicious food.   Try their cakes for their best offering. The mille crepe cake is unlike anything I've ever seen, with dozens of petite layers of creme that are as much of a joy to look at as to eat. The coffee is Stumptown, which is always a plus, and the wine has a decent variety. Most surprising of all is the food, which has a delightful array of fresh sandwiches, perfect for a light lunch. The salmon sandwich is a favorite. The art is modern, curated from both the owner's collection, and a variety of local artists, and lends a polished atmosphere to the place.   The Gallery is my new favorite place in the neighborhood and I hope it will be yours too!"}
{"text":"Very cool interior, just like an art gallery. Great desserts. Chill out with friends, or by yourself and get some great coffee and treats."}
{"text":"My favorite place to come for dessert! The original and green tea milk crepe are to die for!!! I also love their apple turnover ( Their is a disclaimer on the menu that says it takes 20 min to bake) Trust me, its worth the wait ;)  Their coffee and adffogato is super delicious and the owners are SO sweet and cute!  LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"Mid of our biking route, fantastic stop for refuel... with bubble and sweets  All mill crepes are phenomenal, - and green tea is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Great deserts, great atmosphere and great service! They also have wine tastings with appetizers every Friday for a great price!!"}
{"text":"Can't see myself going back, service was abysmal. Ordered the apple turnover, staff warned it took 20 minutes to make, I confirmed I wanted one. Staff spent time talking to their friends than being available to ask to turn down the music their friends kept turning louder & louder. Outside of the staff's friends were 3 other couples who were each trying to carry on conversations. One gave up and left. Staff also questioned why we choose to sit at chairs without a table. After 30 minutes and 5 minutes before closing I asked how my turnover was coming along. Staff never started it because they thought I said no.  I didn't feel welcomed, the music was uncomfortably loud and orders were wrong."}
{"text":"Super cute little place in South End.   Upside -  very cute, nice little outdoor area, good art and friendly people. Good charcuterie plate and yummy wine choices.  Only downside -  no people watching going on here... and you have to order at the counter and they deliver - so only partial wait staff.   Coffee and Pastry  Wine and Cheese Outdoor Patio Not Crowded"}
{"text":"I attended the What's your Zodiac Sign party (wine tasting with sushi) Friday night with my girlfriend for the 1st time. Been stalking them on IG for awhile. So to finally go, it's a big deal for me. When I first walk in, I was greeted by a host. I made reservation (good choice for an event) it get crowded quick. They seated us but then it get chaotic. I wasn't sure where to go and what to quite do. When they're not busy, they will/can bring the wine that's we suppose to taste but there's no instructions on where to pay or what else we can order if ppl like myself don't really care for sushi. After awhile I get it. Pay first at the register. Full menu offered. Their wines for our tasting was ok. I didn't care to buy any bottles. I get to try to famous Lady Millie Signature Crepe.. First time ever. I'm in love.. I was suppose to cut \"down\" sugar and carbs.. But I have cut everything else just so I can have this again.. I read from other Yelpers that the crepes was ship on. Honestly I can care less.. It seem like it takes a lot or work to make.. So why not.  I get a chance to meet the owner.. I couldn't get her name. Soo loud, DJ spinning. But she was warm and accommodating. Surprisingly she remember my name later on the night. And bad me still couldn't get her name!!  I'm looking forward to visiting this place again with my love ones.. When it's not soo loud. Enjoyed the art works on the wall and want to see what's for lunch, have the crepe and try one of many choice of speciality coffees they offered!"}
{"text":"Great food, coffee, dessert! Great service! And with a smile. Just moved to Charlotte and really enjoyed my experience here. My favorite place in town so far. And, the people are absolutely amazing--the owners, William and wife Ana, made me feel like I was in there home and the staff is just incredible too. I absolutely loved it!  Not to mention the food and coffee was great!!!"}
{"text":"Guys you need to get here. This spot has a bombing crepe cake. Please see the picture I took. This thing is 30 layers of crepe with a creme filling in between each. Please enjoy and feel the love put into making this thing.   The ambiance is very clean and nice. The water is on point. I wouldn't have even thought of trying the water but they brought out a glass for me with my cake. It's got cucumber and lemon in it, perfect for this ridiculous heat.   Go here, order cake, eat it. You are welcome."}
{"text":"Perfect place to get some work done, relax and read a book, or have a formal or casual meeting. The space is lovely with white washed walls filled with unique art and plenty of Windows to let in light. The seats are comfortable and tables are clean and each is set with a fresh flower. I had an almond milk latte which was good and reasonably priced and the green tea crepe cake which was also good but not my favorite, I'm glad I tried the cake but wouldn't get it again. I look forward to visiting more often and stopping by in the evening for a glass of wine!"}
{"text":"Beautiful art. Beautiful presentation. This lovely gallery also serves one of the best almond milk lattes I've ever had. And, unlike most coffee houses these days, The Gallery serves coffee in mug, not a paper cup. Call me old school but I love getting my coffee in a real cup! The Gallery also has assorted treats. I tried the checkered cake and it was delicious. There is also wine and beer. The staff is super nice, especially the manager Emily. She consistently makes me feel special and offers me treats to try (perfect for my cheat meal splurges) :) I'm happy to have them in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"My friend and I had crepe cake, tea and coffee here. The employees were welcoming and kind, the food was creative and delicious, and the art was awesome. We'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"A really cute little plate for afternoon tea or coffee! The treats are really delightful and the atmosphere is great as well. I have tried the molten chocolate lava cake and all of the Lady M cakes, and I have enjoyed them all. Such a pleasure to find Lady M in the heart of Charlotte!  Fyi they only have off street parking which can be kind of a pain."}
{"text":"We were here for the lady M cakes. Firstly they really did a horrible job at cutting the cakes. They did not wipe the server clean enough and damaged the bottom layer of several slices. They did not even apologize. Secondly the cakes are not fresh at all. One of the citron Mille even tastes like a month old. We will never come back!"}
{"text":"Everything you come into contact with is as delicious as is it elegant. The space is welcoming, bright and artful. The walls are covered with gorgeous original art that lends to the overall experience.  The savory selections are amazingly put together, fresh, sophisticated and delicious. But it's the cake we love. The millicrepe cake is worth the trip alone.  Delicate, just sweet enough and just plain ol' WOW! I prefer mine with Champagne, which of course they have. And my husband loves the coffee. We always come for just a slice and feel so at home we end up staying much longer.i"}
{"text":"This place has a really cool artsy atmosphere (the owner's husband sells his own paintings here, which are the ones on the walls), and a nice little selection of Lady M cakes and drinks! My favorites are their specialty cakes that they feature sometimes, as well as their Mille Crepe Cake and the Chocolate Molten Cake. There are always specials going on during different days of the week, which makes this place great for hanging out with friends. The owner is also always great to me and my family whenever we see her, and she's super friendly!"}
{"text":"Really cool older to hang out and meet friends. It's quiet and stylish. The 20-something layered crepe dessert is amazing. The green tea flavor is my favorite."}
{"text":"Do not stop in here (like I did) if you happen to be on this block trying craft beer. Completely different vibe and very limited, bottled beer selection. This would be a nice destination spot for a first date if you wanted to talk over a glass of wine on the patio and people watch. Every inch of the inside brick walls and ceiling are painted white. That immediately gives the feel of a gallery (duh) however the dominance of abstract paintings on that white background becomes overwhelming at a certain point to the point where your mind is begging for anything else. The problem with abstract art is you could change it all every month and it would still look the same. This makes a gallery concept stagnant and would never give me a reason to return based on artwork alone (which it should considering your name has GALLERY in it). On my visit, the all Motown playlist also felt odd in this environment (maybe this isn't always the music playlist but I think some chill house techno music would have been a better match). Sitting at a table of 5, 2 ordered cheesecakes and I did the lava cake with 2 scoops of coffee ice cream and an espresso. Not really any complaints though I can't say the coffee ice cream flavor was as pronounced as I was hoping for (probably would go for straight up vanilla next time). Anyway, enormous potential for this place especially if the artwork styles were more diverse and a better beer selection were available."}
{"text":"The gallery is now my new go-to place when I need to get my work done out of the apartment.  It's atmosphere mixes it's own unique flavor of arts. From the art of elegant abstract, vibrant canvas paints to the art of coffee and food. It's calming, cool, and inspiring. This local southend gem is worth looking into anytime of the week. If you're looking to get work done, meet friends, than this place is where you ought to be."}
{"text":"Visited Gallery twice and falling in love with lady mille signature crepe & green tea crepes. My two favorites at Gallery."}
{"text":"I ordered the green tea layered cake with a traditional mochiato and it was the best combination! The cake was delectable with the right amount of sweetness."}
{"text":"Art + wine + dessert = a happy combination!  I love this spot for their crepe layered cakes and wine selection. Love the staff and the atmosphere. Highly recommend this spot for a nightcap or catching up with friends over the cheese place."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town seeing family and on my online journey to bookmark spots I came across this place. Finding places that serve Stumptown coffee is rare enough but they also have LadyM cakes.   The place itself is ok, good amount of seating and vibe is pretty laid back. My only problem was with the service I got.  I asked for a cold brew which I thought would be made in house but was pretty disappointed to receive the bottled version Stumptown puts out. Secondly I decided to grab some beans and asked if they had Hair Bender which they said they did.   After waiting for about 15 minutes for them to get me 2 slices of the matcha crepe cake, they tossed in the beans in the bag along with the cake. Halfway back to my cousin's house I checked and saw that they gave me two bags of decaf. Was too frustrated to go back and deal with it.  I'm sure this place is great but didn't give me a great first impression."}
{"text":"A very cute little place in uptown Charlotte, with a lil outdoor yard you can sit and enjoy the beautiful afternoon weather and part of the skyline. Very nice services, perfect cakes just exactly the same flavor as the Manhattan store. A place for date and girls hanging out."}
{"text":"First time at Lady M and I am impressed. The crepes were delicious and the store has a hipster vibe to it. It would be a nice place to relax and chill with friends. The person working was really nice and delivered the desserts to us and even offered water. The water is super refreshing!"}
{"text":"Giving this place 4 stars because of the quaint, relaxing ambience. They play r&b/soul music while we were there. It's a really great place to unwind w wine, beer, coffee, or desserts! Can't get enough of the art pieces all over the wall!  I ordered the Lady M green tea crepe, not worth getting for $8.50 a slice. I expected it to come out warm and it wasn't sweet enough. Presentation was on point though, but too expensive. Although I really enjoyed my soy chai tea latte!  Baristas were very attentive and it looks like on Fridays a DJ spins after 9pm."}
{"text":"Cute place but very limited wine selection.  We also experienced slow service. Intended to order wine and cheese plate but left after one glass of wine. Ambiance is odd. It's more of an art gallery than a wine bar."}
{"text":"The only thing more adorable than this place is the owner, Ana.   One of my favorite things about The Gallery is how versatile it can be. Need a place with wifi to do work? Looking for a spot to hold a meeting? An event? After work drinks? Date night? Girls night? Wine and cheese? A place to stuff your face full of macaroons? You can do it all here.   I usually come here during evening hours, but recently came for a mid-morning meeting then stayed after to do some work. The music was on point. I think I found my new office away from home. The Signature Mille Crepe is a must get.   The Gallery throws different special events. Follow them on Instagram and Facebook to see the latest upcoming happenings."}
{"text":"Sophisticated yet approachable.   I dropped in with a small group on the tail end of a gallery crawl. The owners welcomed us in and served us some sangria while telling us a little about the art on display. A lovely couple with a lovely place.   After finishing our sangria, the four of us split a bottle of wine and shared some cheese. Nice selection and I loved the baguette, fig jam, and truffle honey that accompanied the cheese.   I'll definitely be back, and next time I'm trying dessert."}
{"text":"Stopped by here on a Saturday afternoon after gallery hopping. Had a tasty roast beef sandwich with a glass of Brut.  The place was mostly empty. Service was good. Saw a couple of people come in and want to order the turkey sandwich & the chicken salad but were told they were out of these items, so they left.  Enjoyed the artwork that was displayed. It made for a bright & cheery atmosphere. We liked the place, hope they have more business at other times."}
{"text":"The Gallery is a sophisticated cafe that invites all types of personalities. When I first entered the cafe, I was pleasantly surprised at the interior design (literally a gallery, with several intriguing art pieces hung around the cafe). There weren't too many people, and the atmosphere was casual but somewhat formal (hard to explain...). My friends and I ordered the green tea crepe cake and the original meille crepe cake. Both tasted absolutely amazing and is a must-try if you visit the area. A slice is $8.00, so a bit pricey but well worth it in my opinion. I personally was hungry so I ordered a  turkey and cheese sandwich combo (chips, water) and the taste didn't blow me away, but satisfied my hunger. If you want a good crepe cake around the Charlotte area, The Gallery is the place to go. Highly highly recommend, whether it may be for a solo trip or for a gathering of friends."}
{"text":"The Gallery has been on my to-try list for awhile after trying their macarons at a recent Yelp event. My mister and I stopped in on a random afternoon, and it was pretty empty inside. There were some folks clearly making use of the WiFi along with other patrons having an afternoon meeting. No worries though because it was easy for us to grab a table. What was not easy though was trying to figure out how to order!   No one greeted us when we walked in, so we were left to creep around trying to figure out the menus. There is a coffee/hot beverage menu listed on a board above the cash registers, so that was easy to figure out. But, help a girl out and show me the wine and dessert list! Off to the side of the register, we found standing menus with charcuterie options. Apparently, they also make sandwiches as evidenced by another patron, but we couldn't figure out where that menu was hiding either. Finally, someone came from the back to help us, but she wasn't exactly helpful in explaining the options because never did get to see the wine list. Anyways, for those of you who are going for dessert, those menus are available up front directly next to the register.   I knew I wanted macarons, so that was a done deal. I wasn't familiar though with some of the other dessert options on the menu so thank goodness for other Yelp reviews with pictures to steer me towards the mille crepe cakes. I wish that the menus either had pictures or that there were refrigerated display cases up front to look at to help with ordering decisions. Truthfully, I somewhat disappointed with the desserts as well as the dirty chai. We ordered one of each flavor of macaron and the green tea mille crepe cake. The desserts were straight up out of the freezer, which definitely is a no-no for macarons. Room temperature is best. The dirty chai came out after the desserts and was lukewarm at best. Maybe it was an off day?"}
{"text":"I couldn't wait to write this review.  I needed to write it as soon as I got home so I wouldn't forget how awesome this place is.  We've (Hubster and I) have been wanting to try this place when we saw it being renovated some time ago.  In an impromptu move, we left a restaurant (I'll write that review later. Ugh. Not good) anyway we left dinner and I mentioned giving The Gallery a try.  So we did.  And we're extremely happy that we did.    Situated near Seoul and next door to Craft Tasting,  it's in a prime location.  We walked toward the front and my heart leaped with excitement.  Cute front patio with couples drinking coffee and wine! Already from that moment I knew this was the experience that I was looking for in a wine/coffee/bakery place.  We walked in and was really taken aback by the posh decor, (beautiful art on the walls..for sale) the fresh smell of coffee and the sweetness of the famous LadyM cakes.  I am sorry but I teared up a little.  We were greeted and handed menus and were told to sit anywhere we liked.  I bee lined it for a corner two person table and sat in sheer delight surrounded by beautiful artwork, quiet rumblings of intimate conversation and the music of Frank Sinatra.    Hubs and I enjoyed rosé and a chocolate LadyM cake.  I read about those cakes in Charlotte Agenda and knew Hubs would love them.  I loved them just as much!! So light and airy and so delicately delicious!!!   Free wifi so if you want a place to work during the day it's perfect.  I felt like I was in a different city...maybe country and I breathed in everything that this place had to offer.  My new go-to wine bar and secret hideaway.  It wasn't super busy which was awesome.  Living in the land of brewery heaven..with the packed patios and loud conversation.....THIS is where you'll find me...  Sipping on wine quietly."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this 4.5, but I'm giving this 4 instead of 5 because my cakes were not as soft as I'd like and were pretty cold (but still super delicious).  If you like a chill environment with good food, good vibes and good art, then this is the place for you. The interior is very nice, and it is a great place to wind down after a long day at work. The service was okay though. When I walked in, no one seated me right away so it was a bit confusing but the waitress was very sweet! The water was also great too (cucumber infused- I think)!   **Get the green tea crepe cake, it's my favorite! They're a bit pricey (~$8-9) but I definitely think it is worth a try. I will be back for their regular food!"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere, but I have two major problems: 1. White onions on sandwiches! I took my first bite and then my nose and eyes started running, like someone was cutting an onion. I took the other onions off, but I was uncomfortable, so it ruined my food. It felt really amateurish to not have red onions on a sandwich. 2. Ice. It's hard to get a cold drink there. Sometimes you are offered cold water that doesn't have ice when you sit down, but you can't get a refill because they just poured the last of the chilled water. Sometimes they don't offer water, so you ask for some and they bring it warm. I tried to avoid this and ordered sparkling water. But that doesn't always work because all of a sudden they miraculously have ice and bring it in a cup with the warm sparkling water. No thanks... I just wish that I could get a consistently cold drink there, since I can't drink alcohol.  Otherwise, I recommend this place to all of my friends."}
{"text":"I had been really excited to try The Gallery for a few months now, but unfortunately I had a pretty mediocre experience. A younger man and woman at the counter greeted me and asked to take my order. I said that I would like an iced latte and asked if they had any flavor syrups to add. The woman said yes but had to look up in the computer which kinds they had. As she was naming them off she mentioned coconut so I said coconut would be great! Neither one of them seemed very confident in what they were doing, as they kept looking nervously at eachother and were quietly questioning each step of the latte making process. Soon after I see that they've just made me an iced latte with coconut MILK. I took it anyway since I was running late, but I'm not impressed."}
{"text":"Mille crepe cakes have finally hit Charlotte! When you get to The Gallery, it's a lovely spot with cool art and great decor. However, since they are relatively new, they are not yet a well-greased running machine.  The seats weren't all filled up, but they were having a hard time getting orders right. We ordered two macchiatos and mistakenly received an espresso instead. As for the cakes, they got frazzled and forgot our order. It took 30-40 minutes just to receive our TWO cakes slices. They don't make them in-house (shipped frozen from NY), so why the wait? They forgot to apologize too.  The green tea mille crepe cake was very light and not too sweet so it was yummy. And one of the ladies were very nice about our couronne cake just being defrosted so we could change it if we would have liked.   Go here if you have the time for the mille crepe cakes. Everything else, you can go to Dean & Deluca/Amelies and have it taste the same. OR you can just order Lady M cakes for yourself as they ship out. It would be the exact same thing."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for it for months. Finally they open! I really like the green tea mille crepe! You guys need to come!"}
{"text":"Once you walk into The Gallery you think you're in a movie set. The environment is clean and romantic, heavenly and delicate. White bricks surround you and bright furnitures await your presence. Not only was the environment drawing, but the fact that this shop was serving Stumptown coffee pulled me straight through the doors.   But this is where my expectations are slapped in the face, mocked, and abandoned. I was greeted by an unkind lady who did not want to be there. She kept yelling at the barista and was not friendly at taking orders. After ordering, it took us at least ten minutes to receive our drink orders and we were the only people ordering at the time. As a barista, I was always taught never to leave drinks waiting, especially milk based drinks.   The cappuccino that I ordered was too dry with about an inch and a half foam at the top. The drink was about 60-70 degrees and the espresso did a great job at hiding beneath the tormented milk.   Maybe The Gallery is known for their desserts and wine and their fancy canvases. Maybe they just need more time and experience. Hopefully, I can come back someday and update this review."}
{"text":"This hidden gem is almost too good to be true. This is the only place I known in Charlotte, heck in N Carolina, that carries Stump Town Coffee. Their breakfast croissant (multigrain) is top notch and comes out QUICK! Quiet, clean and chic."}
{"text":"20 layers in one cake? are you crazy?! nope, just brilliant. This place is delicious and their coffee is tasty too. Oh, and it's a very vibrant fun spot to work/relax."}
