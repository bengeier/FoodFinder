{"text":"Got the lamb shank. It was well prepared. Came with plenty of sides to fill my belly. Waitress was attentive and friendly. I would visit again."}
{"text":"Got the steak salad. Asked for medium rare and it came out perfectly. It was perfectly seasoned and the salad was really balanced in terms of dressing, veggie ratios. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We visited them on an unusually quite Friday night. Our sever was exceptional and made us feel welcome. Their menu is just perfect making a conscious effort to not overwhelm you. Tex mex egg rolls as an appetizer are delicious even if you don't prefer eating vegetarian. Braised short ribs and Pork Aldobo as our mains were delicious. Perfectly cooked and good portions. Icing on the cake were the desserts. Molten chocolate lava cake and Strawberry rhubarb crumble were amazing. The Courtyard needs to do a better job of advertising the restaurant. Most customers can't seem to find the restaurant while others don't even know it exists."}
{"text":"I decided to reserve this restaurant based on the menu. There were mixed reviews on another site (OpenTable), but figured I would try it for myself.  First of all, this place may be confusing to find. I knew the building it was in, but went to the wrong doors (I went to the patio ones facing west - they looked kind of appropriate since you could see into the restaurant, but they were locked). So then I tried the doors facing south. You have to go up a few stairs and there you will see a mini coffee shop (Starbucks) surrounded by a lounge. There was a lady behind the counter, but she just looked at me and continued to do whatever it is she was doing. I had to go up and say \"excuse me, is the restaurant \"the kitchen table\" here?  She said yes, but didn't direct me to where. I had to specifically ask if it was down the hallway behind her.  Then when I got to the end of the hall, I waited behind a couple. The couple was ushered to their table and I continued to stand there waiting for somebody to come to me. The girl at the coffee shop walked by me once without saying anything, but then she came back a few minutes later to ask if I'd been helped.   She then sat me at a table and when I asked if we could maybe have a booth, she made it sound like she'd have to ask specific permission. So I just said not to worry about it.   Meanwhile, while my friend who was meeting me was lost looking for the place, the waiter came up to me and asked if I had another party. I said \"one more person\". He then took the other place settings away but then walked away without taking my drink order. I felt awkward to stop him to ask. He did eventually come back and ask, but it took a while.   Even though he was polite, you could sense an undertone of \"pretentiousness\" - which I don't exactly understand in a place like this. The atmosphere isn't exactly \"high end\". The food and wine were really good. I ate every last morsel on my plate. My friend enjoyed hers too.   Our server never did ask if I wanted another glass of wine, but did eventually refill my water.   He wasn't feeling the humour either - any joke that was made was taken with complete seriousness.   It was also evident that he wanted us out as soon as we paid our bills (which my friend asked to be split) - he hadn't asked us before he printed it. He actually told us we had to figure it out.  Overall, I thought the place was ok. Nothing spectacular. The whole \"high end\" mentality of the place was a bit laughable. However, I will give kudos to the chef for the food. The prices are reasonable too - but there isn't a ton to choose from.  I also just received an email from OpenTable stating that I didn't show up for my reservation- which was for 1000 pts. So even though I had given the girl my name upon arriving, they contacted OpenTable and claimed I was a no show, so now I'm fighting that. Very frustrating.   I don't plan on visiting again."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for a newish restaurant called The Kitchen Table, in Seton; SE Calgary.  Decor was cool and hip. But sadly, disappointed.  The wine list should have been my first clue; Calgary, there's more to red than Apothic and Jackson Triggs!  Be bold and original, not boring and sub-par.  Opting for a Caesar instead (Regina still wins hands down), we had their shrimp Gyoza.  Typical fare, not bad, not outstanding. Always a fan of gnocchi, I was intrigued with the spinach gnocchi served as a side to pork tenderloin with a peach BBQ sauce. Sounds delicious, right? Could've been if the pasta wasn't overdone and pork was too tough and chewy plus the sauce overpowered the dish. I may live in the 'burbs, but c'mon!  Bring great food out here Calgary!  Take a pass on The Kitchen and visit Starbelly instead."}
{"text":"My family and I decided to stop by here as it is near our home. My parents seemed to enjoy the meal but I wasn't the slightest bit impressed. My food was pretty bland.   What I really didn't appreciate was that our waiter was pretty pretentious. I've worked in the restaurant industry before so I like to be extra nice to whoever is serving me but this guy made it pretty difficult to be nice. He had zero interest in being there and wanted to get us out as soon as possible. He didn't really come check on us at all throughout the course of our meal and there wasn't any excuse for him not to as I'm pretty sure we were the only table he was looking after. The restaurant was basically empty."}
