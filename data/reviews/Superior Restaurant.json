{"text":"VERY popular lunch spot and there's a reason. Perhaps the best corned beef or pastrami sandwiches in Cleveland. Ordering is fast and friendly despite a good-sized line at lunch. You're doing yourself a disservice if you haven't experienced it for yourself. Don't let the green brick and chains outside scare you away. This place is a Cleveland treasure."}
{"text":"Have not been here for a number of years, but last night had a pre-Cannon Theatre dinner.  Menu, service & ambience is greatly improved. Menu is a little limited but is supplemented with some daily specials. Advised the waiter that we were going to a show so he kept everthing moving with time to spare. Steps south from Dundas TTC Subway Station."}
{"text":"The half sandwiches here are even gigantic. Excellent corned beef and the potato salad is delicious as well. Never had a bad sandwich here. They will probably have to wheel me out of here on a gurney."}
{"text":"My wife and I were in the Dundas Square area. We didn't know the city at all and were VERY hungry. It was not the best weather to walk around too (wind and rain made my umbrella and eyeglasses useless). I don't remember how, but we entered Superior and it happened to be very pleasant experience.   Loved Bar near the entrance. I would have a drink or two there, but we wanted to eat.  We shared BBQ Braised Lamb Ribs and Duck Breast. Both were very delicious: Lamb Ribs were well done, but not overcooked and Duck was almost rare, but with great juice on it. Cosmo for her and vodka for me served their purpose perfectly. Service was good, knowledgeable stuff, etc.              I recommend it to all who happen to be in that area and would like to have a good dinner.  I do not recommend going there if you are not in that area. For similar prices, you can get better dining experience elsewhere."}
{"text":"The best & biggest corned beef sandwiches in town. Highly recommend ordering a half sandwich with a bowl of soup of the day or a side item. OR you could go for the whole & just wrap up the other half to devour later on. Either way, this place is a Cleveland institution & you cannot go wrong if you're a fan of corned beef!!!"}
{"text":"Ok... Best hot pastrami sandwich I've ever eaten in my life! This place doesn't look like much on the outside. It really doesn't look like much on the inside either. But, oh man... The sandwiches are amazing! Beware, it is kinda expensive... $100 for 5 lunches but definitely a place to put on your bucket list!"}
{"text":"I'll call it a buttery spoon.   As far as diners go it's pretty classy and rather expensive. Two eggs and two pancakes will set you back $4.99. The pancakes were good plate filling size. Coffee for $1.79 is less painful than most diner coffee.  The interior is clean and bright and dinery.  The layout is weird. You have to enter from the back parking lot despite the presence of unused doors in the front.  It's a nice spot, but too clean and expensive for my diner preferences."}
{"text":"I will, most-likely, be upping this to 5 stars.   The only things I can say \"bad\" about the place, keeping in mind that it is a family-style diner, is I've driven past the place every day at least twice for 9 months or so and live within walking distance and would have never guessed it was there or what it is. I don't know whether to attribute that to my lack of observation skills (likely) or just bad signage/placement of signage (just as likely).   I am also not a fan of the hours and wish they were open at least for dinner. That being said, they seem to be family-owned and operated so that probably is the reason.   In Short:   Good diner and deli food, reasonably-priced, and friendly staff in a relatively clean environment."}
{"text":"I have been eating there for over 30 years,  even  before the fire, a clean kitchen and good  people and their food is the best."}
{"text":"I got turned on to SD by co-workers years ago. Of course the big buy is the corn beef. Don't think Ive ever had anything else there. Very tasty big sandwich but the last time I got it. it was fatty. When I got turned onto the CB sandwich years ago I think it was running $9.50-$10?  It has now grown to a whopping $14.50!... which I think is outrageous. Just a sandwich and a pickle for $14.50. (Wish my pay check got inflated like that over the years!) At least for that price it would be nice to include a side or something.. But I think because they are well established and people have fallen in love with them then it's just like oh well people will just pay it and they know that. They seem to make their money and get out at 3pm. Nice living!! Again great big tasty sandwich just too pricey. I don't go often. I also like their potato salad. 4 stars if not for the price."}
{"text":"One of the best corned beef sandwiches in Cleveland. Not as crowded as another corned beef place around the corner. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"If you want the best Corned beef, Reuben or a Pastrami SANDWICH, look no further.  Superior Restaurant is the best of the best.  Get here before 3 pm as they lock the place up and go home.  The corned beef and the pastrami sandwiches are stuffed to the limits and the rye bread is great, as all the meat falls off the bread as it slides down your throat.  The best cuts for a sandwich money can buy.  The french fries fill the rest of your plate.  Cold soda galore to wash everything down.  There are plenty of other selections to satisfy even the pickiest eaters.  When wanting that Reuben, or corned beef sandwich just go to Superior Restaurant !!!  Extra pickle PLLLLLLLLLLLease!  God Bless you for your great food and your great staff!   I live in Medina and it was worth the drive.  Can you open on in Medina?   We have nothing here quite like your awesome Reuben.   I met one of your employees from Medina, does he deliver?   LOL !  I hope your business doubles!"}
{"text":"If you want corned beef or pastrami, look no further.  Superior is the best of the best.  Get here before 3 pm as they lock the place up and go home.

Their are plenty of other selections to satisfy even the pickiest eaters.  When wanting that pastrami sandwich, try Superior!!!"}
{"text":"Im looking at these reviews after a horrible breakfast.  Got a sunrise sandwich/croissant.The croissant was burnt on the grill on both sides.The sausage was like a cracker since it was overcooked.The egg was brown from the grill.However, somehow they where able to not burn the cheese............. I covered it with a napkin and drank my coffee which was decent.......... 10 bucks with the tip and couldn't stand to eat it.I won't stop again"}
{"text":"The food has always been fast and good. From the Corn beef, steak sandwich and soups. I have never had bad service or bad food. I can be in out of there for lunch in 30 minutes most times."}
{"text":"Great breakfast food. Heard outstanding things about the corned beef, waiting to try it."}
{"text":"Great value.  Excellent corned beef and pastrami.  Very generous portions.  Open early for early bird breakfast.  Plenty of convenient parking.  A great downtown adjacent cleveland find."}
{"text":"I live in Lake county and when I want an exceptional Corn Beef sammich this is the place to go to. Corn beef piled so high that it falls over and you have to keep restacking on your bread. When you stand in line you see the corn beef sliced to order. Taking your children here for their first JUMBO sammich experience is great they can't believe their eyes. Have never had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"I love the corned beef. They are very friendly here. Know how to keep the line moving during their lunch rushes."}
{"text":"This little diamond in the rough was a pleasant surprise! I originally had intended to grab a deli sandwich at Slyman's only to find that they were closed and by chance or fate happened upon Superior Restaurant.  The food is in a similar style to Slyman's: deli sandwiches piled high with quality meets and veggies. I had the turkey melt and my lunch companion had the turkey club; both served with a side of fries and half a pickle. Both sandwiches hit the spot!  The restaurant was clean and the staff were friendly and attentive. It appears to be a family owned and operated establishment, but I'm just making that assumption based on the conversations I overheard.  I will definitely be going back to try their turkey reuben next!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here, I have a great lunch. I was here on 8/1. My husband and I split a Pastrami sandwich and fries. Same great tasting, huge sandwiches they've served for years. Unless you have a very large appetite, I strongly encourage sharing."}
{"text":"So our job ordered a to go meal from this place for lunch, I am the one who actually called and placed the order and I placed a order for a catfish meal with fries and coleslaw. Granted I might have been looking at an outdated menu but I specifically said CATFISH and the guy who took my order didn't correct me or say \"sorry miss, we don't sell that\" he continued to write it down and charge me much more than the catfish dinner was. I didn't pick it up, a coworker did and now I'm stuck with a cod dinner and I don't eat cod. I call them and his basic attitude was oh well, we don't sell catfish. I asked him why wouldn't u tell me that when I called and asked for it and he was just clueless on the phone. I hung up and will never order anything from this place. They are a joke and the customer service is horrible."}
{"text":"Food is good make sure you instruct thwm if you havw a specual diet or allergy as I do."}
{"text":"I went there with my friends for a Summerlicious dinner on July 4, 2009.  The service was quite good, kept our drinks filled and was very courteous, and it bested my expectations. The food on the other hand was quite pedestrian and sub-par.  I had the Niagara Charcuterie Plate as the appetizer, and the meat was alright, but the small slices of bread that came with the meal were rock hard.  For the entree, I had the House Made Ravioli with Kobe Beef, and I felt that it was entirely way too little beef compared to the amount of pasta there was. On the other hand, the parts with the beef were quite tasty.  Finally for dessert, I had the Chai Creme Brulee, which was just average once again, nothing special.  Overall, I gave it four stars for the excellent service that was quick and courteous, and two stars for the very \"meh\" food, for an average of three stars. I guess I shouldn't expect such great food for Summerlicious, but it really wasn't all that great."}
{"text":"Delicious lunch dive. The sandwiches have enough meat on them to make four sandwiches at least. Corned beef is fresh off the brisket. Roast beef with Swiss cheese and potato salad is the best I have ever had.  I went with a group and we were all stuffed with a smile on our face when we walked out. :)"}
{"text":"Partly my age and partly not drinking alcohol removes me from most of the other yelpers. Often I find highly rated restaurants hold no appeal for me as I could give a a rat's patootie how many kinds of beer are stocked. I have been to many places in my life and times bringing me to realize that most things simply do not matter in the long run. It is only how much I enjoy each day that matters.   My reviews reflect how a place or a restaurant made me feel not just the food or the service or who else dines there. A recent first visit to Superior Restaurant made me feel my age, my life, my likes and my differences. I had never read a review for Superior in the year I have spent with yelp. If Superior were in NYC or LA tourists and locals would line up. In my city there is no wait for the biggest Reuben I ever saw. Since I know there are few suppliers of corned beef in Cleveland I am aware that I am likely to be served the same product every place even with a \"BEST  CLEVELAND CORNED BEEF\" recognition by someone somewhere.   Eating only half of the huge sandwich I felt strong affinity for my hometown. Superior is one more treasure that we do not boast about. We take for granted what residents elsewhere have to gloat over to reaffirm their advantage. Superior is better than most delis I have been to anywhere yet it goes on about its business in a lackluster deli environment without concern to how many stars or how many reviews are thrown its way."}
{"text":"Great food, great portions, amazing prices. I had one strange time when I tried calling in for takeout and put the phone down and forgot about me. Other than that everything has been great. Super cheap and delicious breakfast until 10am. Huge amazing lunch sandwiches. Great cheap spot for lunch! Little parking lot out back. Service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"This is joint has some of the Biggest and Best Corned Beef sandwiches . enough said."}
{"text":"No expectations upon entering. The decor is from the 70's but it's clean and is in high motion. Lots of customers at tables and at the carry out counter. Prices are reasonable,  amount of food is good. We all were happy with this diner that came as a recommendation by a friend 5 minutes before arrival. We'll be back to try more."}
{"text":"Definitely should have tried a sandwich. What was ordered should have been sent back, but don't like doing that for simple reasons of trusting if my food will be tampered with. Just my personal agenda.  Roast beef open face sandwich with mashed potatoes, both were cold! Potatoes dry and had a funny taste. Definitely instant.  Meatloaf no flavor, again mashed potatoes dry and gross.. had to eat with ketchup to get some kind of flavor.   Waitress was friendly. The environment seemed nice and welcoming. This is why I will give it three stars, and not one."}
{"text":"Still has that old school diner vibe. Got a quick easy cheap breakfast of corn beef hash, eggs and a coffee. Our waitress was very nice and helped us create dishes off the menu. I haven't been to this spot in a few years and I'm happy it hasn't changed"}
{"text":"Blew me away.  Went for breakfast this morning and without a doubt the best breakfast I have eaten since I have been in Cleveland.  I normally am not a huge fan of omelets but this one was a aHa moment.  Light delicate and fresh.  We will be returning."}
{"text":"Meh. The breakfast food at this place was really not that great.   Everyone raves about the corned beef, but I'm not a corned beef fan, so they couldn't win my love there.  Would be a 3-star place, but the service was poor."}
{"text":"After 3 incorrect orders we will no longer be ordering weekly breakfast from here. EVERYTHING was wrong with latest order. NEVER ORDER TAKE AWAY FROM HERE! They never ever get it right. Both meals wound up being thrown away. Avoid!!"}
{"text":"Use to be my fav for corned beef. Prices went up and up. The sandwich is huge. The last time I went, they gave me a cold corned beef sandwich, I guess because they were closing soon. That is not cool or OK. I want to eat my sandwich now, not warm it up! Vienna is much much better."}
{"text":"We had great and fast service, we were in and out in 20 mins, we're looking for a place close to the rock and roll hall of fame and this was a great choice for Saturday afternoon, Sandwiches were huge and they had tons of options."}
{"text":"We happened by the Superior restaurant after seeing Stephen King at the Canon Theatre. Wonderful ambiance. It is very reminiscent of a late 50's to early 60's restaurant. The wait staff were very attentive and knowledgeable.  The servings were just right. One of the first times that I ate everything on my plate and I was ready for dessert. A very good wine list. All told it cost about $60.00 per person."}
{"text":"As a candidate for potential job position, I was wined and dined at the Superior Restaurant in downtown Toronto.  I'm not sure what I was expecting. The last time this was done, I was taken to Bymark and a $40 hamburger.  This time, I was taken to this quaint Pub/restaurant near the Eaton Centre.    ENVIRONMENT As said previously, the ambiance was great.  It was dark but still well lit at each table, the dark hard wood floors and chairs gave the place such a comfortable feel.  The only thing that concerned me was the place was almost empty at lunch time.  There was only 1 other table with customers.  Perhaps the restaurant relies on revenue generated from the night, especially during show nights at the cannon theatre (nearby).  FOOD & COST I had the Penne Ziti ($17) and it was absolutely delicious.  I am not usually a pasta person but I would definitely recommend to anyone to have this dish at least once.   However lunch mate had the sirloin hamburger ($15) and basically couldn't eat it b/c it was dripping in oil.  The bun was drenched and apparently so was the meat patty.  She did nibble on the fries.  For dessert, the girls shared the creme brule and the second dessert on the list. They were nothing extraordinary (hence not remembering what I had), just average.  SERVICE I don't think the service was above average. I would not consider the servers attentive. We had to ask for the dessert menu and ask for other things too. Perhaps the server was just learning but she did not anticipate our needs.  This place is definitely not Bymark but I know the food is good. You just have to be careful with what you choose. I'll come back here to give the place another go. But for now, it will be A-OK!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed attentive service at the bar before a show at nearby Massey Hall. While the mussels were advertised with sweet potato fries-in actuality; nothing more than garnish. The wine list is lightweight, a handful of uninspired beers on tap.  It's bar food plain and simple. Sometimes that's what you except at a bar, except when it calls' itself  Superior but maybe I missed something."}
{"text":"Went here while traveling through town for lunch. Very good customer service and quick turn around had been seated, ate, and paid within 25 mins. It's a little pricey for a deli dinner but when you see what you get for that price you understand. Will be back next time in town"}
{"text":"This is a pretty regular diner with great corned beef hash at breakfast. Fresh made and griddled just right, I would eat it everyday if heart attacks didn't concern me. Full of regulars in the morning, saddle up to the counter and enjoy some sassy waitresses with your coffee and eggs."}
{"text":"Awesome service and food! Corn beef sandwiches. Great for quick lunch and killer soups every day. Breakfast is great with real deal potatoes! Corn beef hash!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE. We were visiting from Virginia and our hotel told us about it. We came for breakfast and we hesitated a bit with the neighborhood. But when we walked in, everyone, including customers gave us smiles. We knew from the comfortable decor that we had found a gem. I had the Meatlovers omelet, my wife had a breakfast sandwich. I'm a big eater and I couldn't get around my meal. My wife ordered grits that came in a cereal bowl. Huge portion, perfectly cooked. But the standout if the breakfast was the Corned Beef. I had a side shot that looked like a good 8oz serving. It Melts in your mouth. I would come here to buy it by the pound. Eat here. Check your ego at the door and enjoy a truly memorable meal."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best corned beef in Cleveland.  Sorry Slyman's."}
{"text":"I love this place for breakfast. Nice staff and they are fast. I stop in before work. Great diner food."}
{"text":"This place has a long history in Cleveland and a long takeout line during lunch. Its been in the same location for a long time, used to be an entirely different building from what you see now, but it burnt down and had to be rebuilt. Since then the inside hasn't changed too much, but there have been renovations for the furniture so now it all looks pretty good. No frills deli, where you can count on good corned beef and friendly service.   I've been going here since I was little, it's actually the first place my dad took my mom to when they moved here. I don't really recall getting anything but the corned beef basically. I'm sure I've gotten other things when i was younger, but of course don't remember what. My usual order now is fried mushrooms and a corned beef sandwich. I've also tried the pastrami and the cheddar potato pockets. All are so delicious!!! I can always count on good corned beef here, and so much of it that I have to split one or else I can never ever finish.   The beef is packed on and you literally have a sandwich that is way bigger than your mouth can handle. Thinly sliced beef that just soo good. I really haven't found any other places that compare to how they make it. Sometimes I order it with coleslaw, which is such a perfect complement to the beef. Crispy and I'm getting my veggies (kinda). It comes with a half dill pickle which is always yummy too. Fried mushrooms are always fresh, and the pastrami sandwich is really goood too. Piping hot.  A corned beef sandwich now runs 8.50. Prices have risen with the economy, but portions at least are still the same. It's so worth it.  If you do come here, just go past the take out line and find yourself a seat. The waitress will be over in no time and your order will be on its way."}
{"text":"What a great little restaurant. I've never stopped in here because to be honest, I always felt it looked so dodgy from the outside. After you stop in though, you can see that it is full of seating, including booths, bar seats and tables.  It serves as part convenient store, part deli as they have everything from deli sandwiches, to breakfast cereal, to Advil, to a variety of canned and bottled drinks. The service was so friendly and welcoming, and they brought my food out in a matter of minutes. I ended up getting just the 1/2 corned beef melt, but it was more than enough for one person and was delicious. I also got a side of fries, which were nothing special, but satisfied my craving for them.  The only thing I would say about this place is that it is a bit pricey in my opinion, even the 1/2 sandwich was $9 and change. However, they do have a good selection of menu items and beverages, and I do think the portion sizes are generous. I would definitely return and recommend to others, despite its modest outward appearance."}
