{"text":"Ok, slightly above average food but in my mind a bit pricey for what you get.  I think they are trying too hard to be upscale when what they could be is a solid, neighborhood place. That said the food is pretty good as long as you stick with the red sauce. Any olive oil based sauces have been underwhelming.  Has potential, just needs a few adjustments."}
{"text":"We had heard a lot about this restaurant, and were excited to try it. Upon arrival, the ambiance definitely did not disappoint. The restaurant has an embossed tin ceiling which gives it a lot of charm and character. Our waitress was efficient, though it didn't seem that the owner thought so. We unfortunately heard her making comments to, and about the waitress, which we didn't find to be professional. The owner was loud and intrusive, which took away from our overall experience at the restaurant. We ordered the bruschetta for an appetizer, and it was quite good. They also brought us a generous amount of warm delicious bread sticks with a dip that was of a Mediterranean style. It was very good as well. Other than the starters, we found our food to be rather average, which was quite a let down. We had soup and salad for our next course and they were both subpar. The wedding soup didn't have one meatball in any bowl, and the salad, while fresh, consisted only of iceberg lettuce, and didn't seem to fit with the rest of the meal. The house balsamic was also bitter and tart. We ordered the Cod Romano and the Seafood and Peppers as our main course. While the cod had good flavor, it was heavy and greasy. The seafood and peppers was unexceptional. And the fact that they only accept cash is inconvenient, regardless of  the ATM on premises which is the first thing that you see when you enter the restaurant. We would probably give this restaurant another chance if it weren't for the owner. When we were leaving the restaurant, it became clear to us that she was gossiping about us to our waitress, who looked embarrassed. If anyone should be embarrassed, it shouldn't be the waitress. Needless to say, we wont be returning."}
{"text":"Great Italian restaurant, it's on the pricier side, but you get what you pay for. The special of the say is usually a few dollars off. The food here is delicious.

This is a family run restaurant, from the hostess to some of the waitresses, to Al, the proprietor, it's all in the family and they make you feel at home. The recipes are based off of Al's mothers' southern Italian cuisine. 

This place is cash only but they have an ATM right in the restaurant. It's BYOB but the recently opened a bar and they have a great wine selection.

If you live in Avalon or Bellevue and you haven't been here - get off your butt! Worth the trip to Avalon if you live somewhere else."}
{"text":"Took a drive over to the new location upon recommendation from friends who raved about the food.  So we already had high expectations in place.   Well, those expectations were met with major disappointments.  My hubby ordered the linguine with clam sauce and when 3/4 of the dish was left untouched, I knew better than to ask how he liked it.  I ordered the chicken Mia and couldn't quite figure out what exactly was wrong with it but actually everything was off. The chicken was overcooked and no matter how much sauce you ladle on, was never going to pass the grade from the first bite on.  I ordered the angel hair side with the house marinara and honestly folks, Prego jar sauce is far superior.  This is homemade Italian food?   I don't think so.  The side salad was simple but could have been so much better with the addition of beets or some shaved parmesan and cracked pepper offered.  My hopes for some crusty Italian bread were dashed as well, and once the bread was gone, they never replenished it.

On the plus side, I thought the atmosphere was quaint and our waitress was very attentive, but those are minor contributions when you want great food.

Although they have a full service bar, you can BYOB (which we did) for a $9.95 corkage fee.  $5 would have been better."}
{"text":"This restaurant just open their new location in Kennedy Twp.. I was extremely  disappointed. This was their opening day. Could understand that everything was a little hectic and slow in service along with a long time (20 mins.) between salad and my meal. I ordered the Chef's Lasagna with extra sauce. First the small salad. It was served in a small saucer. Nothing exceptional and you get more from chain restaurants. Then came my meal, disgusting. Not a lasagna you'd expect from an Italian restaurant. Not even a taste to resemble lasagna. It was loaded with cheese and hardly any sauce. I ordered extra sauce. The lasagna was served in a casserole dish, now do you think there was extra sauce. Any other restaurant serves it on the side so you can add as much as you like. As I kept eating the lasagna, I wasn't sure if it was pieces of chicken I biting into so I asked my wife to taste it. Sure enough it was chicken, not called for on the menu for lasagna. Good thing I wasn't allergic to it. I didn't quite eat half and had the rest boxed up. My wife's meal was only a salad not much but she said it was very good. Then came the bill $$$. Yes it is a little hefty for what you get. My lasagna was $15.95 on the menu, but there was a $4.95 up-charge for the chicken, of which I didn't order nor ask for. Oh another $1.50 for the extra sauce which there wasn't any. My lasagna is now $23.95, \"WOW.\" My wife's salad should have been $8 ended up being $10. We did have desert, as scoop of ice cream and expresso. Total bill $41.95. We are local to this restaurant, but would find it hard to give it a second chance. There is an Italian restaurant  in West Park (called 1905) about a mile and a half from here that makes this restaurant look really \"BAD.\""}
{"text":"This place is right up the street from me and I've been there several times. Every time I've gone I have had an outstanding experience! The food is good, but the service is great! The owners are friendly and the waitstaff has always gone the extra step to ensure our experience was the best it could be. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a classic mom and pop Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"I'll agree with a previous poster that this is the nicest restaurant in Avalon.  But that's not saying much.  Sorry, I wasn't that impressed - this is slightly-better-than-average Italian American fare.  It's good, honest, and homey, and while I really enjoyed my entree, almost everything else about the experience was slightly lacking.

At times, the service was a bit loopy, and yet still trying too hard. Our group of five came in three quick phases, and at one point the waiter took the drink order of one of my dining companions, and walked away before he could take my order.  We were also asked how we were doing before we had even ordered or even gotten some breadsticks - thanks, my water is particularly icy?

Waitstaff wearing bad polyester ties is pretty '90s, as was the iceberg lettuce salad served first.  I would have LOVED it if the progression of the meal was more traditionally Italian, because the portion sizes were perfect for it - that is, the side pasta served first, then main course, then salad (or salad with the main course).

I REALLY enjoyed my main plate, cod with white beans.  It was well-cooked, and had all of the flavors and consistencies I expected - the bread crumbs were a lovely addition.  However, the marinara sauce had too much tomato paste going on, and the greens in the salad left something to be desired.  I know salad greens are expensive, but iceberg lettuce isn't the way to go in a restaurant like this.

Overall, I wish Mia Madre would cut back on the pretense or the fancy or whatever it is a bit - it's the honest home style food that makes people come back.  For what you get, the value is good for the price.  Also NB, it's cash only."}
{"text":"Pricey for the area, but that can be a good thing. The food and service was nice. I sat at the bar and the other guests were talkative and inviting. Which tells me that they were comfortable too.
My meal with 2 beers and pasta was about $29. I gave a customary 20 plus percent tip."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to go to here since they opened, finally made it. The cash only sign was the first thing to hit you in the face. Decor was a litlle over done.  Restaurant  owner very friendly  and welcoming.   Waiter was friendly, jokes a little over the top.  Second to hit you are the prices considerably  higher then expected.  The charge to split entrees $5.00 for pasta & $8.00 for entrees with meat, $1.50 for anchovies  on a Ceasar salad  which was served in a small soup bowl. Pasta (ziti) $13.95 was large but very ordinary .  Chicken Mia $21.95 was chicken breast 4 cherry  tomatoes  & 3 pieces  of artichoke . Chicken was covered with sauce that wasn't  anything  special.  To summon things up food was okay, overed priced.  Not sure if we will return."}
{"text":"Discovered this restaurant by accident while visiting Pittsburgh. It turned out to be one our greatest finds. The food, service & owners were incredibly \"off the charts\" beyond 5-stars!! Everything we ate was delicious . Cannoli was the best we've ever had."}
{"text":"Loved Mia Madre Trattoria! We had the Veal Filetto-chargrilled veal (very tender) in a bacon and cabernet sauce (WONDERFUL!) & Cod Romano (A TREAT) and lots of pasta! Everything is homemade! The owners introduced themselves and made excellent food recommendations. Everyone welcomed my 1 year old daughter. And she also LOVED their food! Cried when we took away her 2nd empty bowl of white bean spread.  Our family will be making MIA Madre Trattoria a new favorite dining destination for sure!  It's the ideal dining destination for a celebration with a group of friends or an intimitate date night.  We plan on going back for both!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I would eat the bruschetta everyday if I could. And the house dressing with the side salad is simple yet so good. Everything I have had here has been great, chicken romano, pizza, fried mozzarella. They have an out door area which is nice in good weather!"}
{"text":"My wife, two friends and I had dinner. I ordered the  chicken mia. And it was delicious. The service was exceptional including the food server and hostess."}
{"text":"Just left this restaurant for the second time in a week and our third time since they opened. Christy and I we're here last week with our friends Cindy and Moe and just like then the food was excellent. The service was fantastic and we had the opportunity to meet the owners Shari and  Al.  We're glad they brought a unique , non-chain type of restaurant to the local area.

This is my first ever posting to Yelp but I thought that it was worth it because of the unique experience.

Bill F."}
{"text":"Incredible classic Italian done old school in the best possible way from the menu to the decor (I love the \"Last Supper\" painting in the dining room!).  The appetizers are really good especially the bruschetta and stuffed peppers.  The sausage in the stuffed peppers is surprisingly soft like a meatball and flavored really complement their marinara sauce. For dinner, definitely try the cod and beans.  Deceptively simple, but prepared superbly with nicely seared fish, white beans, and sweet, sweet garlic."}
{"text":"Yes Yes Yes! Great food & service. Awsome family Italian restaurant. ( The whole family works there! ) Best linguini & clam ever, with enough to take home. Make a reservation on the weekends though; also cash only, no cards accepted, but there's a PNC ATM a block away. Check it out, you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"My dish is linguine & clam. It was fabulous when they owned Uncle Als in west view , really good when they moved to Avalon. But this new location, it wasn't good at all. I was very disappointed . It tasted bland, like too much flour in the sauce or something. Maybe Alex wasn't cooking that night. Also the price is steep for this dish compared to other places, you should at least have leftovers to take home. I'll try it again on a weekend & see if it's any better,but three strikes you are out in my book..."}
{"text":"Stopped in last night after a long day working on our house. We wanted to stay local and with so little options we chose Mia Madre. It's been quite a few years since we had dined there. They left Avalon for a period of time, so we always forget they're back. 
It took about 10 minutes for our server to \"greet\" us which was merely \" Are you ready to order?\" We weren't quite ready so we placed our drink order. We thought they served wine, but apparently they don't. We just ordered water. Alexa brought our waters and we still needed a moment, so we asked her to come back. It's rather dark in the restaurant and I was struggling to read the menu. 
We ordered- hubby had Chicken Marsala and I had Chicken Bruschetta. Both come with salad and they serve you little bread twists. Dinner was good. Portions we fine. Service was extremely bland. Our server brought us our bill and never returned. It was $47 for the two dinners. We laid out $60. Eventually the \"host\" Came by and said I'll be right back with your change. 15 minutes later nothing.... We never saw her again. Our server was sitting in the back of the restaurant talking with another table. She never came to our table again. Another server Tiffany actually cleared our plates. 
We dine out a lot and I have been in the industry for over 20 years. I am more than happy to leave a great tip for great service, but this was subpar service and decent food. To tell us you'll be back with our change and never return is rude. You can't expect anyone to be ok with leaving a 28% tip for the service we received. It's totally not about the $4. It's the principle. We've left 50% or more for great service. We respect the business and would hope others would too. 
I hope you enjoyed the extra tip because we won't be back. 
Oh and you have to go in the ladies room! It's like walking into grandma's house! Stuff everywhere! The bathroom about 3'x3'.....
It's a shame that people rely on the folks they know to support their business. You could do so much better...... if you simply cared about everyone. Truly."}
{"text":"Great food!  Great prices! Great family service! And did I mention they have great food!!!  You can bring your own wine or use the full service bar. The appetizers are awesome. Try the bruschetta, banana peppers,greens and beans, fried mozzarella all are great to share. 
Ask for Alex, tell him Tony D says hello."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what some of the others were complaining about. The new location has very easy parking, a much larger bar and dining room and the food was as great as usual. We found the service and family atmosphere as good or better than before. 

Our party of six sampled these appetizers, bruchetta, stuffed banana peppers and the greens and beans..each was excellent and there was enough for all. Main courses included chicken piccata, veal and peppers, chicken parm and the cod and beans. I like the Alfredo sauce over angel hair pasta and suggest the sautéed spinach which has a nice bit of garlic (which we like). 

We find the prices reasonable and the food quality equal to our other favorite Itailan restaurants Franco's and Tambellini's.. And you can still bring your own wine if you wish. 

We'll be back often !!"}
{"text":"This is the first review I've ever written on yelp, but this place is so Great with a capital \"G\" that I felt compelled to write a little something and help steer Pittsburgh residents in the right direction... 

Once you go, I promise you'll leave wanting more!!!

Everything on this menu is fresh and made to order - no freezer ready foods here! The flavors are mouth watering and the meats are ever so tender!

I'm from Chicago, lived in NY for 5 years and currently reside in Los Angeles (for the past 10 years) and I promise you, I know Italian and this is where it's AT!  In fact during my almost 2 week stay in Downtown Pittsburgh I had to revisit and take along a few friends -- if ever I'm back in Pittsburgh again soon, I know where I can get a great dinner that will never disappoint!

The restaurant is family run and they take pride in what they do and it shows!!!

It's worth the drive no matter where you are coming from - portions are large and each and every bite is scrumptious!!

If you're a foodie like I am - This is a MUST and well worth the adventure!

Try the Chicken Romano or Meat Lasagna - YOU WILL LOVE IT!
Heck, try anything and everything - It's ALL GOOD!"}
{"text":"very good food, large portions, very friendly staff. only downside-they don't take credit cards-cash only. if you know ahead of time-no problem."}
{"text":"Good main dishes. They need to improve their side dishes. A bowl of spaghetti with marinara isn't creative enough for a restaurant with this much potential. Nice kinda dark atmosphere. Very pleasant overall. Not terribly expensive."}
{"text":"This place I found to be outdated and unappetizing. The strange breadsticks were unpleasant, and they don't have regular bread (?). The service was in-your-face and obnoxious, though responsive. The food was average at best. Lastly, for the price, I'd be much happier at Alexander's, or even Bravo!. It's not an awful experience but, unless you live in Avalon, save yourself the trip and try one of Pittsburgh's other excellent Italian restaurants!"}
{"text":"Not a good first visit..  very disappointing.  I used to frequently visit the bar/restaurant that used to occupy the space - the Tower.  I miss that place.   Walking in it was fun to see how the new place was decorated. It was still the same place --the decor just now had an Italian flair.   The crowd in their 50s and 60's.  The menu - the look very basic.. prices standard for appetizers except for the main dishes.. they were at $18.00-$19.00 prices.   I ordered a drink and placed an order for takeout.   At that time and I had a good vibe about the place but that quickly changed.  I asked for my bill - as my credit card laid visible on top of the bar. When it arrived and I noticed it was hand written so I asked bartender if the credit card machine was down? (because sometimes establishments can manually enter the numbers to process.)His response  \"we only accept cash\"  SERIOUSLY!???? I said \"Wouldn't this have been good information to tell me when I walked in and placed my order?! \" His response \"Theres a sign on door and theres an Atm right outside.\"  Ok gee thanks.. I could not believe it!!  

So,  I walk outside and look for the sign on the door - it's NOT eye level or highlighted in anyway - black and white generic and accompanied by other signs   I guess its \"ok\" not to tell your patrons this important information because YOU posted a SIGN so that makes it right?   It looked like a lot of regulars in the restaurant. What about the non-regulars?  Maybe this information should be stated when orders are placed?!   If there is a sign on the door- then it didnt just happen today. Now I am forced retrieve money out of a bank that isn't mine and will be charged a FEE???!  Thanks a lot Mia Madre Trattoria...  very poor way to treat your patrons and I will not be returning.    

Sure its your prerogative as a business to establish cash or credit or both but I do not feel its fair to the patron when you do not make it clear.  Blindsiding a customer is not a good idea.  

There should have been signs posted in the bar area pr somewhere else rather than the front door -black and white sign that ISN'T eye level? In this day and age - who carries cash with them?  

So are you wondering if I enjoyed my takeout?  It was hard to tell because it was overpowered by garlic.  Just because a lot of garlic is used - it doesn't make the dish Italian\".  I was disappointed with the food as well."}
{"text":"Great pasta, egg plant Parma and other classics...family run and worth a trip !"}
{"text":"Food and service were good. Large portions and tasty food - unexpected for a little hole in the wall in Avalon. They do charge $10 up charge for sharing a plate - which are big enough for two people!? I thought they were a bit pricy for what we ordered. And be aware they are cash only."}
{"text":"Love this place! Came here with my family for dinner 1week ago and everything was fresh! I had the calamari appetizer to start! It was cooked perfect and it has a little spice to it. We also had an order of meatballs which the guys enjoyed. For my entree I had the baked salmon with dill cream sauce and side Cesar salad. Salad was good but I was more interested in the salmon. The Salmon was not over cooked and served about med.well.and the dill sauce was so light but flavorful I almost asked for more. I somehow made room for tiramisu. It was so good! I've also had the cannoli before and it is my other favorite. The place makes you feel like family and when you're eating the food, it's like you're eating at an Italian family's house. Come hungry because they feed you well!"}
{"text":"Clams from a can that will put you in the bathroom for an entire night! Don't forget about the excessive prices for flavorless and lackluster food. The server took my drink away before I was finished .. Lovely service (insert sarcasm here). You're better off at Olive Garden or getting frozen pasta in the grocery store!"}
{"text":"overpriced, food below average, service horrible. I think most staff are related and they are a little slow, not to bright. Pretty sure they are the ones who wrote positive reviews. Save your money I felt like I had been robbed. 1905 eatery is close by, food is excellent prices are good."}
{"text":"Calimari app tasted a little bland at first but the flavor of the red sauce developed more over time to a delicious complex sauce crying out for bread - which arrived fresh from the oven. House chianti was fine & affordable.  Entrees included veal parm & white clam linguini. By far, clam sauce is the way to go. Finish up w/ fabulous tira misu!! Overall, nice family run place w great service. If you don't like hugs, stay away.  The owner's wife will track your departure to make sure you receive a warm hug and a solicitation for a review of your meal.  I love that about this place but not everyone will like that.  : )"}
{"text":"It was ok but definitely not worth even close to what they charge.   Their house pinot tasted like they put grape juice in it.   The food was so so.   For $100 for two people I expect to get a really good meal and that's not what we got. .. not bad but never going back either"}
{"text":"\"What's that?  A fancy place to get a glass of wine in Avalon?\" I said when I heard about Mia Madre Trattoria...followed by about two full minutes of laughing.  But, wow, it's true.

I can confidently say that Mia Madre Trattoria is the nicest restaurant in Avalon.  Yes, the exterior is still the same as when Sergio's was in this spot (annnd Joe's Corner Store before that), but in this case don't judge the outside.  Inside, the restaurant has been totally re-done: brick walls, a cool bar, fabric napkins.  I felt like I stepped into Boston's North End.  There is an awesome patio as well.

So to the wine...A great list, served by the glass or the bottle.  I liked the house pinot grigio, but the prosecco was excellent (tasted a little like sour apples, in a good way).  You can also BYOB.

The focaccia was perfection, so good that I'd stop by for just that app and a glass of wine.  But if you insist upon entrees (and you should), the eggplant parmigiana and the baked ziti were almost as good as my Nonna's.

To top off a great experience, the owner's wife is incredibly friendly and she makes sure you had a good time before she'll let you leave.  Plus, the prices are reasonable and it's always easy to find free street parking in Avalon."}
{"text":"Great find! The staff couldn't have been more friendly, and the owners were so personable that it felt like a little taste of Italy in Pittsburgh. The homemade cannoli is a must... It was the best I've had since being in Rome!"}
{"text":"Truly authentic Italian food that is always delicious!! The atmosphere is cute and cozy and it's BYOB, which I love!! The owners, Alex and Shari, really do a great job of making you feel like family while you are there. The greens and beans are an excellent choice for an appetizer. The pizza is fabulous also - we often will order that as an appetizer as well.  The pastas are amazing and the portions are large, so you will most likely have leftovers. Pictured below is spaghetti with a mix of marinara and alfredo with meatballs - simple, but one of my favorites!! Also try the cod with white beans - very authentic. We like to go with a big group, order a bunch of food and just share everything."}
{"text":"Very pretty Italian Restaurant with very good food. They have a nice bar but still allow BYOB wine. The veal dishes are wonderful.Very fresh ingredients and the food is made with care. Must try if you haven't been here. Make sure you call ahead on weekends. They also will do parties so check with them if you have an event."}
{"text":"Excellent veal dishes, the best anywhere.  Pleasant staff and good service.  Reasonable prices.  Try their veal Romano.  It's the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"This is my favorite family owned Italian Restaurant in Pittsburgh. It's one of those places that you hear your parents talk about... where the owners know your name and their children help them out in the kitchen and by waitering. I love the fact the food is always AMAZING and you always have leftovers to take home.  I love it when our kids are with us bc they take them back into the kitchen and give them a cooking lesson and food. It's always the perfect dining experience! Lastly, Birthdays are a must here! No one will sing happy birthday like they will to you!! You will feel loved and like you are part of the family!!!"}
{"text":"Our favorite all time place for Italian. I feel like we were in Mama's home kitchen. We have NEVER had a bad meal here, everything from the wine to the dessert was excellent. Alex and his entire family made US feel like family. We will ALWAYS return to our \"home away from home\". Love this place"}
{"text":"Wow. I've had some bad service in restaurants, but never THIS bad. Not only was the one server close to the rudest person I've ever met, but management was just as bad. It was TERRIBLE! 

The restaurant was COMPLETELY empty when we were there and we were a party of three. Two of us were waiting for the third and though we were sitting on one side of a normal table and there was a third table setting (which they had to set up when they seated us), the waiter brought us two small slices of bread. I guess they're rationing, but you'd think if they're going to charge around $20 for a pasta dish they could afford a couple slices of bread. Guess not...

When I asked a question about happy hour, the waiter didn't know (it was his second day), so he got a waitress who would. After she'd already answered the question of whether the happy hour specials were available in the restaurant or just the bar) she said, \"In the bar\" when I asked more about the happy hour. I explained that I knew that, since she'd just answered that question for me and asked what happy hour was there. She said, \"Drink specials.\" SERIOUSLY??? I don't believe ANYONE could be that clueless, so she was clearly just being rude.

Management supported this horrible waitress and said if I wanted to know the drink specials, I should go to the bar. REALLY??? I'd NEVER been to a restaurant where the wait staff (even in the restaurant) couldn't tell me what the happy hour drink specials were... 

Add this horrible service to the fact that the little restaurant, which is in a strip mall next door to the Wine and Spirits store, charges INSANE prices for the area.... for PASTA. $19 for linguini with clam sauce (which from the review I read in their other restaurant probably includes canned clams)? I could see that in a nice stand alone restaurant, but this is a strip mall. In Kennedy. It's not a fancy restaurant downtown or in Sewickley.

We happily went down the street to friendly service, better prices, and great food. STAY AWAY. With the horrible service and management combined with high prices in a strip mall, the odds of them lasting long are slim. Wait for them to close and go to the next restaurant that opens there."}
{"text":"Just have to say we just had them cater my daughters graduation from college in May for 30 people!  It was awesome!!  We had chicken Marsala, baked ziti, Cesar salad, and garlic knots!!  Everything was hot and the presentation was beautiful and everyone raved about it!!  They were very easy to work with and will never go anywhere else for anything we need catered!!! They also are generous with their portion sizes!!"}
{"text":"This is an awesome place to go for just a date night or a big group.  You start out by being greeted as if you are going into someone's home - which it is since it is a family run restaurant!  It is so beautifully decorated and the outside deck is awesome!  The fact that you can bring your own wine is a plus (& having the option of a mixed drink for those that do not enjoy wine is great as well) and it is a nice relaxing atmosphere so you do not feel rushed.  The food is excellent and the service is great.  I would definitely recommend this place for a nice night of good food, fun and relaxation!"}
{"text":"The chicken bruschetta was out of this world! It was served with a fresh, crisp,cold house salad and a side of linguini which were both very good. Alex, the bartender  likes to tease my wife which is always entertaining."}
{"text":"Delicious, family-owned, Italian restaurant in Avalon. What you'd think of when you picture hearty, Italian food. Portions are large and savory and likely generations old.

Place has two rooms with moderate seating. We showed up at 7pm on a Thursday night and had to sit at the bar- no tables for 2! Will call nezt time for reservations. Bartender became our friend by the end of the night and we appreciated his banter.

Place is BYOB for $3.50/person. We got the lasagna and chicken parm. I barely ate half my plate and anytime I leave with leftovers, it's a plus. Food came hot and perfectly seasoned.

Dessert was cannoli and it was deliciously classic. Worth the splurge! Thanks. We'll be back again!"}
{"text":"We went with a group of 4. I was hesitant to try a place in a strip mall, but was pleasantly surprised. As soon as you walk in it smells delicious. 

We ordered several appetizers to start off. While the calamari wasn't my favorite, it wasn't bad. The portions were massive and everyone enjoyed their meals. While I agree, the corking few was a bit high, I like a byob style restaurant. 

I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I can only speak for the lasagna - it was microwaved. Sauce was watery, plate and outside of lasagna was piping hot, while the inside was cold. For such high prices, microwaving food is just depressing. Waitress was smug, almost walked away from our table of three without taking my drink order, had I not stopped her. One visit was enough for this place."}
{"text":"Yes, A-OK this place is. Truly would like to make it a 4 star but had a subpar dish of linguine with white clam sauce recently. It's almost like there was cream of chicken soup in it! So thick. Flavor was ok, noodles done PERFECTLY. I'm just not used to this texture for this dish, think of it to be lighter.  Anyway, great happy hour, warm and welcoming owners, the italian foods are good. Had the stuffed banana peppers and meatball and ricotta appetizers once....very very good!  Wish the lunch menu was available all day...especially in an area like this...far from upscale area.  Will definitely return to try their other options."}
{"text":"Add half a star for a 3.5 experience! This place is not for the budget conscious folk - they belong at The Olive Garden.  And other Italian places in Pittsburgh are pricier than this one. Mia Madre Trattoria is a family owned operation with deep roots in  the Pittsburgh food industry. Food is unpretencious, reminiscent of traditional Bronx/Brooklyn/NorthEnd joint. This is not a New-Age creative chef 'foodie' place but rather an old style solid nostalgic Italian trattoria, not a ristorante. Don't let the white tablecloths fool you! In fact expect service to be relaxed, not overly trained, but friendly and competent. And the food is well done, made by a kitchen clearly influenced by a grandmother's style of cooking. Average before alcohol per person is $25 for a meat-based entre, pasta side, and salad. Complimentary Breadstick twists lean toward a firm pizza dough. Veal is the house specialty but you won't go wrong with the cod or salmon either."}
{"text":"Fantastic dinner with friends.  Service and food were excellent. 
If you like veal this is the place."}
{"text":"What a great place, food was fantastic and plentiful, the owners were great and the place was decorated adorably. The wait was a little long BUT we made reservations at the last minute. Will def be coming back here, so good! Oh yeah, it's BYOB"}
{"text":"I have eaten here on a few occasions and just found the entire experience to be very average, almost unmemorable. Considering Pittsburgh has a deep rooted Italian tradition, I expected more from a family-owned establishment advertising the recipes used are \" my mothers authentic southern Italian\" flavors. The atmosphere is rather dark and they do have frequent large parties dining so it can get loud. Service each time I have dined here has been courteous, not extremely welcoming, however, I have seen both times the wait staff being very friendly with certain tables, and from talking with others who have dined here, there are frequent regular customers here. The speed of service was on the slower side, although not slow enough to dock any stars for that aspect. My main complaint would be the food. Portions are large, they are fairly priced for the AMOUNT of food, however, I have found everything I have sampled to be bland. I have tried the Cod Romano (oily and bland), the chicken and peppers (some spice from the banana peppers but the chicken was overcooked and dry), the Chicken Mia (despite artichokes, spinach, and Roma tomatoes the dish had little flavor), the Chicken Marsala (this was my favorite dish I tried-the chicken was tender, mushrooms were plentiful, and Marsala was abundant....I'd recommend ordering this from my experience), and the Mediterranean pasta(very little feta, kalamata olives, roasted peppers. Lots of spinach but it was quite oily. A few tweaks with this dish and I think it could be tasty). Pasta marinara comes with the dinners as does a salad. The marinara sauce tastes like a less flavorful version of Ragu. And a $10 up charge to share items?! That's pretty cray-cray! I applaud this restaurant for opening in Avalon, which basically has zero in the way of dining options besides pizza, however I think if you are craving Italian, it's worth it to drive to Bloomfield for an authentic Italian dinner."}
{"text":"We called ahead because had a party of 8 on a Friday night, after trying 3 different times in 2 days, someone FINALLY answered the phone. 

The first thing I noticed when walking in was a sign on the front door that said \"Cash Gratuity Preferred\", um WHAT?! The note was also repeated on the menu. The menu itself is quite large, but we quickly noticed how pricey it was. They have a full bar, but it is also BYOB for a corking fee of $9.95 a bottle, that just seems INSANE to me. 

As for the food, it was TERRIBLE. A few of us got chicken dishes, and the rest of us got pasta dishes. 2 people ordered the Linguini with White Clam Sauce. It was grey and smelled uber fishy. Neither of them ate more than 2 bites of it because it was that bad. Even though the waitress apologized, it was not taken off the bill or replaced. That's $38 of food. As if that wasn't bad enough, every person at our table got sick that night. 

Our entire experience start to finish was disappointing. We most certainly will never be back."}
{"text":"Nice neighborhood Italian spot to check out.  We dined there on a Thursday and they had a wine special with dinner.  A good place to satisfy those cravings for the classic southern Italian dishes.  Owners and staff are full of personality.  The owner also sang an Italian happy birthday song while we were there which was impressive and entertaining!"}
{"text":"My wife and went there on 3/30/2013 for our wedding anniversary. This is a great family ran gem.  They are all friendly and helpful with everything.The food and service was awesome. The wine suggestion from the bartender was one of the best glasses of wine I have ever had..  Be sure to make a reservation and they are CASH ONLY!!  Well worth the drive \"all the way out to Avalon\".  Next time we are in Pittsburgh area, I hope to go back."}
{"text":"I eat there last week where I was served sour tea. The I ordered Chicken Mia and when I bite into the second piece of chicken it was rancid!!!!!! I never was asked how my meal was!!!! The waitress was just surprised that I didn't want a Togo box. So bad tea, really bad food, and bad service. And it wasn't that busy."}
{"text":"First time visit - apparently they'd moved and then moved back to the location they're at now across from the Borough of Avalon building.

The first thing we noticed when we walked in was that the hostess thought it would be just fine and dandy to play with my wife's hair, simply because she (the hostess) liked the color.  It wasn't just a passing touch either, it was several seconds of playing with it while gushing over it - enough so that we both felt uncomfortable about it.   (So my wife grabbed the hostesses leg and gushed over her thigh... hey - turnabout is fair play, right?)

The setup for pricing is a bit - odd.  Apparently they don't have alcohol anymore, it's BYOB - but they charge you if you bring any.  As stated in another review, they also only take cash.  Prices were, I felt, rather high for a pasta dish, too.

Still - overall food was good.  I must say, I don't agree with making a Caesar salad using mozzarella INSTEAD of Parmesan - but it wasn't *bad*.  All of the main entrees were flat out delicious and portion quite generous.  Dessert was also very good - the tiramisu and the limoncello (sp?) cake both excellent.

Finally, as we were leaving, our a little too familiar hostess kissed us all.  This, again, just felt a little too much.

So if you want excellent food and a little mild groping for slightly more than it should cost, then I have to recommend Mia Madre Trattoria.  We'll definitely go here again.

But we'll get it to go next time..."}
{"text":"Outstanding Family Trattoria. All the southern Italy standards are on the menu. And so are some less traditional items along with several fish options. Very reasonable prices for excellent food. Molto delizioso"}
{"text":"I felt like we were back home at one of the little Italian restaurants in Bayonne NJ. They are authentic Italian , like you sort of walked into an episode of The Sopranos ( I don't mean that in a negative way --- just the vibe ) 
And this place just a mile from our Pittsburgh place is just like that. 

The food was excellent. I had the Seafood dinner ( calamari, shrimp and cod ) and not deep fried !!! Sauté'd in light brownish gravy with roasted peppers and cherry peppers. 
Very New York City. We just don't get a lot of place like this in my hometown of Pittsburgh.


Ps I read some of the negative reviews ????
My hunch is these reviews are the staff and cousins of the competing restaurants in the area. 
C'mon now !!"}
{"text":"The food was good. The decor was very classically Italian in an almost tacky but not quite sort of way. Our waiter Alex very professional. He did a very good job of keeping us hydrated keeping our courses coming at an appropriate speed. It's a very nice restaurant for the area. If you live nearby and want something a little bit classier as a date night this would be a great choice. We got tons of food. I ordered the chicken Romano which came with three pieces of chicken and all entrees come with a generous side of pasta. The quote wine menu very confusing since it is a BYOB establishment and the special during the week is a glass of wine and entree for $19.99. The corkage and beer fees are a bit on the pricey side."}
{"text":"Not impressed. After several races about this resturant we decided to give it a try. Party of 3. The resturant was dead but when we walked in they acted insulted we didnt make a reservation. However when I called earlier that day no one picked up to confirm if one was needed.  Our appitizer was good we had the Mozzarella Salad.. Which we all enjoyed. Our bread basket was never refilled. One piece per person.. Kind of eh. Then after waiting 10 minutes for a glass of wine ordered (Again a slow evening we were only second table in dining area) our salads and wedding soup arrived. Salads were basic. Wedding soup while filled with chicken and meatballs was bland and unimpressive. Our entrees were Chicken Picatta, Veal Romano and Cod Romano all with a side of pasta in alfredo. The prices are alittle high but from others was told portions are large. I didnnt agree. Two small pieces of cod and chicken with 3 for the Veal. All were nothing special very mediocre. The alfredo sauce tasted as if it were from a can. Very disappointed.  I was hoping for something very tastey and left disappointed. In fact everyone did. The constant reminder that cash gratuity was perferred was tacky in my opinion. Can't say I will be rushing back. I may give them another chance but not anytime soon.."}
{"text":"Fantastic meal and friendly wait staff! The greens and beans were excellent as an appetizer and everything we ordered was quick and cooked to perfection. The wedding soup was amazing and the red pepper dipping oil with the bread was delicious. We had the chicken Mia, Marsala, and chicken and peppers. Also the lemoncello cake is out of this world. We will definitely be back!"}
