{"text":"I walked here when visiting my sister downtown and we had such a nice meal. I got a build your own bowl and it was delicious! If you like getting to hand pick and chose your meal at places like chipotle and subway, you will love this place! It has so many options all of which are fresh and delicious...  I would especially recommend the kale slaw and the cabbage slaw, both paired nicely with the chicken!"}
{"text":"Wow I hated this restaurant. Wildly mediocre pretentious food. They serve reverse osmosis drinking water. Great. And they serve bland food trying to be interesting served by bad wait staff. Really interesting space failing badly on food. Maybe it flies in a third rate city like Cleveland but overall it's fast food."}
{"text":"I would up load a picture, but I inhaled lunch as soon as it got to my desk it was so good.  Hands down one of the best lunches I've had in a while.  We normally don't get out for lunch much and get delivery a lot at work. This tasted fresh and delicious when it was delivered. I really like the idea of being able to customize what I'm having and there are so many good choices. My co-worker said this was our best lunch in all of 2016, and I agree! Good job Rebol, we'll be back, hopefully there and not at our desks next time!"}
{"text":"I had breakfast once at ReBol, which was excellent. The Turkish coffee, the \"yolked up\" eggs -- so tasty! With \"yum yum\" sauce and kale slaw. So I had high expectations when I went back for lunch.  And I was disappointed (with the food -- although the service was very friendly). The No. 4 Signature Bol. Firstly, it wasn't served in a bowl, but rather in a disposable tray reminiscient of airport food. Disposable dishes for eating-in always irks me, because of all the extra garbage this creates. And rice bowls served in ceramic bowls can be so beautiful. Secondly. The \"sticky rice\" wasn't short grain rice -- it was basmati. This is baffling, because why put \"sticky\" on the menu if you're serving a long-grain rice?? Next up, the \"harissa yogurt\" tasted like it was made with a basis of sweetened yogurt (like vanilla yogurt), which is weird and kind of gross because I want my spicy yogurt sauce to be piquant and taste like spicy yogurt, not like vanilla. The papaya slaw was so awful, I couldn't eat it because it had been sitting around too long (veggie sides need to be made fresh, same-day. period.) and -- it was also too sweet! Cleveland culinary people: please stop putting sweeteners in my savory foods!! A papaya salad can be salty, spicy, and should be nice and sour and a bit bitter even -- but this one was just achingly sweet. Yuck.  The only good parts were the wonton chips, the scallions, and the spicy cashews (delicious)!  Overall though. I can't recommend this, which is so sad because, looking at the menu, this place has so much potential. Potential that is wasted with terrible execution."}
{"text":"Despite my potential bias based on my experiences at townhall, I decided to ride my bike over to their restaurant families newest location REBoL, located at the wonderful new public square. My hope was that my beloved basil fried rice bowl would be reincarnated here.  But mostly, I wanted to get away from my desk on a nice afternoon and enjoy the weather.  I was promptly greeted by a manager upon walking in which was very nice (who then informed me there would be no basil fried rice for me today, oh well.) The space is a little tight inside, and while there is indoor seating this location is clearly designed to get you outside to a patio table. To order, walk up to the counter, make your selections and they give you a buzzer.  It took only a few minutes for my dish to be prepared and  I was actually was picking up my food as my friend was signing the credit card receipt for his.  The menu is rice bowl centric and they had preconfigured bowl options, along with a \"build a bowl\" menu.  I went the build a bowl route by going with the chicken, green beans, shirataki noodle and cashew.  Despite my custom build, somehow something strongly resembling zucchini made it's way into my bowl which I ended up eating around.  The dish was also served cold, which I found surprising but this didn't detract from the flavor.  The dish came with some homemade tortilla chips and some soft shells you could use to wrap your ingredients in.   To wash it down I decided to try one of their organic soft drinks.  The flavors rotate daily, and so based on the flavors of the day I decided to give it a go.  There was some confusion about this at first, since I was told I would have to wait for my drink to be prepared upon picking up my food order.  After a few minutes I went back to the cashier and asked if I should have been handed a cup.  Realizing I didn't actually receive a receipt for my order, had it been busier I feared I might have been left paying for another beverage.    Once I had my cup in hand I then learned their taps, which were labeled using magnet clips and slips of paper were mislabeled.  So after experimenting with the taps I was able to properly rearrange most of the labels.  However, they were one label short so guests after me were left with a mystery flavor.    Overall thoughts?  It was about what I expected.  They have a great location on the square.  The food was ok, and was not surprised to see mystery ingredients make their way into my dish since this was a major complaint of mine at their sister restaurant townhall.  They seem to be working out the kinks in their processes (mislabeled fountain drinks, confusion on the cup), a sentiment shared by a few friends later that evening who have also recently been there.  But if you are downtown, like bowls, like patios and like summer stop by and give them a try."}
{"text":"A+ on the location and setup (they have ping pong!), but a C for the food. The Korean bowl was under seasoned and quite small for the price. It was mostly rice. It's not great, it's not awful, but it is convenient if you happen to be in public square."}
{"text":"I am sure this is someplace that is really good to certain people, but i am not one of them.  I liked the atmosphere and location.  Everyone was so nice.  I am just a little picky about food.  I wasn't sure there was even anything on the menu that i would eat. I got rice, chicken with bacon aioli sauce.  There were these fat rice noodles at the bottom of the dish.  It was a little too spicy (for me, it doesn't take much) and the rice noodle things had a weird texture.  I would recommend this if you like vegetables and slightly spice food. I am not the adventurous eater."}
{"text":"I have only been twice but both times the experience was perfect. I was staying at the Westin and the valet recommended it. The food was so fresh and flavorful. I was surprised to see and learn about the non GMO foods and how they are leading he way in this movement. I had sandwiches and smoothies. I am looking forward to trying the coffee on my next visit.   It was a nice day so we sat outside and watched all the kid and families playing in the water spouts. Cleveland really has done a great job with this new Public Square. It feels like a park now.   Well done Rebol!"}
{"text":"If staying at the Renaissance Hotel in downtown HAVE to stop in. Great atmosphere, delicious flavors and friendly staff (Lauren is amazing!!) Conscious eating at an affordable price. Best Bulletproof coffee I've had yet and fun social games if the weather allows."}
{"text":"Ate here today.  It was fabulous!  I am only sorry that I did not take a photo of my meal. Food and Service were fantastic.  The owner is blessed to have a manager like Rachel minding the store for him.  The atmosphere of the place is upbeat.  One can eat either in or outside. Here are some photos that will give you a feel for the place:  https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rebol-cleveland?select=HLZp3NaaLBwOCCvMxHGh_g I would go back again in a heartbeat! and recommend a trip to downtown Cleveland to see what has been done with Public Square.  Rebol sits on the quadrant right across from the Terminal Tower."}
{"text":"Cool concept, but execution needs work. I got the Moroccan Lamb and the Tuna Poke. Lamb reminded me of dry hamburger meat, and there was barely any Tuna. I kinda wished I went to Chipotle instead today."}
{"text":"This was a delight!! Awesome atmosphere, killer modern decor and food was pretty yummy. I expected something bland and Unfilling but to my surprise it was anything but that! I got the Rebol Lamb bowl with Matcha tea and a latte To go. The mint matcha with the lamb bowl was ever so complimenting  and the portions were plenty on all fronts :) I look forward to returning in the summer!"}
{"text":"First time here. Food was amazing! I had the Harrissa tuna poke and my boyfriend had the pork nachos and also the steak and egg broth. Everything tasted out of this world and was also beautiful to look at. Do noooot miss out out on the peanut butter and honey milkshake. To die for !"}
{"text":"I love this downtown restaurant. However, they do not bag your food when you carry-out. You MUST ask for a bag, which is unbelievable!  On the other side, this restaurant has great food."}
{"text":"I can't comment on the restaurant itself because I experienced their food through a catered event. However, the food was quite delicious and I look forward to visiting the location sometime soon. Since it was catered, the food was spread out buffet style and I was able to try a wide variety of options. The flavors were quite delicious, and while there were a few items I didn't particularly enjoy, the others made up for it. I happily went back for seconds!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful addition to the newly renovated public square. I have to say that the style of food is refreshing and it's nice to have a healthy to go option downtown.   I created my own bowl made up of zucchini & Squash noodles, green papaya and carrot slaw, tuna, yogurt sauce all topped with sesame seeds. It was the right amount of food and made me feel extremely good about what I just ate  afterwards! The wonton chips that are served with the bowls are fantastic! I could have ate a whole bag of those. The bowls are a great size and most people in my group only ate half and were able to take the rest home.   *Note: yelpers if you check-in on the yelp app you get a FREE pour over coffee."}
{"text":"So the wife had a gift card from Rebol that she'd been sitting in for months. The bad thing is the location of Rebol. It's downtown  right in the middle of public square. Which means in terms of parking, it isn't the easiest to get to. Sure, if you're already downtown that isn't an issue, but if you're specifically going downtown for Rebol? That's not going to happen. There's nothing wrong with its location, if you're a businessman or businesswoman it's perfect but for anyone else? Eh. Enough of that though.  The interior is modern, that speaks to the restaurants fresh, quality food. They advertise everything as non-gmo and organic.  The flavor definitely speaks to that. I ordered a bowl, they call it REBol, obviously. The one I ordered I built it myself. You start with protein, I ordered the tangy grilled chicken, then you add a base, I went with their sticky rice. 3rd you go with a topper, I added their grilled carrot and jalapeno hummus. 4th, you add a sauce. I chose their Harissa yogurt. Then you go with a garnish, I kept it simple with cilantro and basil. Every order comes with wonton chips which are very fresh and very crisp.  I've seen other reviews speak about how the bowl is cold, but when you're mixing hot and cold, sometime the cold ingredients will over power the warm ingredients. Nothing wrong with that, I expected it tbh. I'm not going to take away from the rating and review for something I expected. That being said, the Harissa yogurt on top was excellent, a slight kick that tied together the juicy chicken and the sticky rice perfectly. I'm not a slaw person, but the slaw in the bowl was crunchy and had just enough flavor and as far as the hummus goes, it had just enough carrot and jalapeno to not overpower the freshness of the hummus base. I'd love to come back because the bowl wasn't too filling and it didn't leave me feeling sluggish."}
{"text":"I love their custom bols, always consistently fresh and quick service. I have been here several times now for lunch. I wished they delivered."}
{"text":"Stopped here today upon finding it while walking downtown. I was very excited to try it out and was happy to see the best drink options. While looking at the menu I noticed that two of the workers were busy taking selfies and pictures of each other. I ordered the Matcha Latte and got a paleo chocolate chip cookie. After sitting for a while the worker who took my order told one of the girls taking pictures what to make for me. It took her a while to make it.  The latte was average and I'm not sure the cookie was truly paleo. I wouldn't come back for drinks. Though I would be interested in trying their food. The food looked good and had a neat menu. It is also located in such a great spot."}
{"text":"The Turkish coffee is amazing. Never thought I'd find something so hippy in Cleveland but it's awesome. The food is really good - tasty, filling and priced really well. All around enjoyed coming here.   Quick notes: This is a fast-casual place What's Available: Coffee as well as real food. Both are REALLY good"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today. Staff is very friendly, the food came out super fast, and everything was delicious! Had the honey vanilla latte (which is huge btw) and the tuna poke bowl which had so much flavor. Love that everything is organic as well."}
{"text":"Bowl was awesome! Food was fresh and plentiful. Many choices to choose from. Alonzo was very helpful explaining the menu and offered us  samples of many sauces and ingredients. Healthy fresh bowls!"}
{"text":"This place is so cool! I wish they had one in Chicago! The location is perfect, right in the middle of the city and thy offer a variety of healthy foods! I got a milkshake... but I'm convinced It's healthier than other milkshakes! They offer vegan and paleo options! Definitely recommend checking this spot out! And they also have a cute out door area where you can sit or play ping pong."}
{"text":"I am amazed by how organic the food is as well as its prime location in the heart of Public Square. On a cold day, I was looking for somewhere cheap to go for breakfast, so I decided to make a stop here. I had a breakfast bowl and some ginger tea. The meal was very filling and all for $8.50. The server at the front was very considerate and took time to explain what was on the menu. He was also more than happy to refill my glass with hot water! If I am in Ohio again, I'd come here to check out the lunch items."}
{"text":"I love what this place represents and their message.  Non-GMO, tasty, abundant and affordable food is not just a pipe dream--you can make it happen and Rebol seems to be leading the charge in Cleveland.  This alone sets a solid 5 star frame work, but they put their money where their mouth is in the form of good food and ambiance.  Rebol is located in the Public Square with indoor and outdoor seating.  I sat at a picnic table outside and watched a bunch of toddlers playing in the fountain while I drank my complimentary pour over coffee (free with Yelp check-in), how quaint is that?  There is also a ping pong table and corn hole set outside if that's your jam.  Oh right - the food!  I had the #9/BBQ Pork BOL and my husband made his own.  Mine was rice based and my husband's was greens.  You can go healthy or indulge a little.  The combo of base, meat, sauces and toppings are endless.  If I lived in Cleveland, this would be a lunch time staple."}
{"text":"Went here once and tried to get drinks and dinner with friends. I was really excited to try the menu but the service was slow and terrible we alI left. We waited in line for 10 min to order a drink than got a drink 10-15 minutes later. I was sad I didn't get to try the food but I hope the service gets better."}
{"text":"Well it's official; I've found my go-to spot for lunches in Cleveland; Rebol!  This place is awesome, I really like their \"spin\" on the fast casual food for lunches with some really unique and tasty options.  I created my own Bol and loved it! The chicken was awesome and the sides were great. The only bad place about Rebol is that they're not located in my hometown of Denver."}
{"text":"I love Rebol! I'm not from the area, so I trusted my Yelp app to lead me to a nice spot to grab a beverage, something to eat, and hop on my laptop for a few. When I walked into Rebol I got so much more than I bargained for!  The vibe is trendy, upbeat, and cool. Everyone working there was young and very nice. The food looked delicious and it was. They offer bone broth sippers, bols, and smoothies. My husband and I opted to make our own bol, although they do have pre-made combos to choose from.   I went with chicken as my protein, sticky rice for my base, street corn salsa and avocado and sweet potato pico as my toppings, bacon aioli for my sauce, and scallions for my garnish. Not only was this absolutely delicious, but it was nice knowing that their ingredients are 100% non GMO, organic when possible, and the dressings/sauces are free of refined sugar.  To drink Rebol offers coffee, mimosas, bloody Marys, craft beer, wine, and cider. I had a can of Cidergeist which was a first for me. Bubbles are my favorite and this Cincy made rose ale was refreshingly delicious. One of the workers suggested it to me and I'm glad she did!  Rebol is conveniently located in the center of the city and they have a nice outdoor space as well -- including a ping pong table! Wifi was free and they had a nice long benched table that proved to be a great office for a little while. Next time I'm in Cleveland, I will definitely be paying Rebol a visit!"}
{"text":"I loved this place! They have tons of options for vegetarian, gluten free and paleo with each item under the selection options labeled accordingly. You can make a more chipotle style bowl with rice and steak, poke with the tuna or what I did and go for zucchini noodles, pork and hummus for a totally different taste. They also serve bone broth which I wanted to get but didn't, but would love to come back.   The ice rink is up for the holidays so this place is packed and it's hard to get a seat (it's right next to it). That's my only complaint is not a lot of seating and with everyone coming in to get hot chocolate and warm up it was hard to find a spot to eat ."}
{"text":"Flew in on an early Saturday morning to stay downtown.  The manager met me with the biggest smile and positive energy, got me eating a phenomenal breakfast bowl, and started me off right.  Went again for a coffee the next day, solid spot."}
{"text":"After a long stint away from the US (I missed yelp while traveling 100x over!) this was a welcome home that was so needed. The service was exceptional. Our cashier couldn't have been nicer and was very informative on the menu.   We got the pulled pork nachos which were huge and delicious, and a chicken pho bowl, which was also awesome. They also had a good selection of local beers and ciders, which was nice."}
{"text":"Perfect food, awesome decor, love the staff and set in Public Square...Kudos !  My favorite is Signature Bol #6 or you can build your own...... I always leave full and feeling good."}
{"text":"I like it! Trendy, health-conscious, quick, convenient. But also... maybe a little skimpy? I got a poke-bowl style dish and it was good but not super satisfying (and I'm not like some huge appetite person.)   But at the same time, it was a good place to get some quick food that wasn't going to be an artery clogger. I appreciate the ability to customize your order and that there were veggie options too. And it was a super friendly upbeat place to be! I got to eat on a little picnic table and soak in the sunshine. But I guess my overall verdict is that I've had some more flavorful and more filling for the price point.  Final statement: I like-ish but don't love, and can see myself giving it another chance because I really think their concept and values are cool."}
{"text":"It's pretty good food. Service was quick for the amount of people there (noon during RNC). My gripe was that the food was overall pretty bland. I got the number 4, which is a chicken, rice, lettuce combo. The chicken had no spice and the rice was literally white rice, so I left the restaurant desiring to taste something more than steamed chicken...  The green tea was pretty good, seemed fresh. They say everything is organic, but I'm not so sure after having my meal.   My other gripe is that if you sit at the bar, your conversations are ruined because people literally place orders behind your shoulder. Completely inappropriate placement of the registers. Move them so as not to disturb guests.   Other than that the atmosphere is good. There are very few EY people there, which is a major plus."}
{"text":"Fantastic open atmosphere and great customer service! The food is very healthy and artistic on its own! The art on the walls are intriguing and looking outside and watching people play cornhole or ping pong while eating is a great addition. I wish there was more variety in the type of foods, but other than that, great food!"}
{"text":"I like the uniqueness of this place vs. everything around it.  We sat on their patio, right on Public Square, and got to watch all the kids play on the new splash pad.  All the food looked delicious so I asked the friendly lady behind the counter for a recommendation.  I got the #6 Pulled Pork/sticky rice/cabbage slaw/soda BBQ/Jalapeno/wonton chips.  It was delicious and had a kick without being too spicy.  It was only $7.50 plus tax and I had enough for a left over lunch for the next day.  I also got a Pourover, which I was told the machine they use is one of only eight in the country.  I felt fancy.  They have milk, almond milk, and coconut milk you can get in it.  Definitely worth checking out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Back today to get my fix: banana chocolate muffin and peanut butter/hot chocolate/alcohol concoction. I also got a carrot/orange juice in a bottle. The best thing today though: the awesome man behind the counter wrote down the recipe for a tumeric/almond milk drink for me so that I could put the recent canister of tumeric I purchased to use! I made it when I got home and it is AWESOME. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I brought my daughter here when we were at American Ninja Warrior.  Chipotle did a great job at providing a boiler plate on how to prepare and serve food.  Rebol takes it to a whole new level.  We were greeted by....  hold on, this was 2 in the morning.  Everyone should be exhausted, crabby, irritable and disdainful for having to work this late late shift.  We were greeted by the friendliest and personable worker (and Kent State graduate) that gave us his full attention.  Completely unexpected.  He recommended the spicy Korean steak for me and some type of chicken for my daughter.  The price is right.  Actually, it was a little less expensive than I thought because of being downtown Cleveland.  And the food was some of the best I have ever had.  Perfectly cooked.  Perfectly paired with sides.  I look forward to watching this place grow in popularity, and expand beyond its 3 locations in Cleveland.  10/10 on service, quality, portion, location, atmosphere and price."}
{"text":"So I'm going to be honest, I'm a little frustrated with my experience here.  I placed my order with UberEATS, so perhaps the fault lies with what's listed on their site, but I'm assuming Rebol places the content?  I ordered the vegan falafel bowl, which, admittedly, was incredible.  I also ordered the poke bowl for later, because, to my surprise, it said it could be made vegan.  I wasn't sure how that would work, but I thought, sure, why not, let's try it.  I also added a banana flax muffin to try.  After placing my order I received a phone call that I was unable to take but did listen to the voicemail and Emily left her number to call the restaurant back, confused about my request for a vegan poke bowl.  I called back immediately, no answer, just the restaurant voicemail.  I waited a moment and called back, voicemail again... I left a message explaining that I was also confused about the option for that bowl being vegan, so if that wasn't possible, no worries, just remove that from the order and bring the rest.  No response to my message, but my food arrived, fairly quickly... Tuna poke bowl included... I'm vegan. I have no use for this and had requested it canceled.  The banana flax muffin included chocolate chips, not mentioned on the menu, I do not eat chocolate.  Again, perhaps the main restaurant site details things better, but that was not the site I placed the order with so I'm a bit frustrated at having paid for 2 food items I cannot eat..."}
{"text":"Rebol is absolutely a coffee shop that anyone within 5 miles who needs coffee should make an effort to visit! My friends and I were not able to get an early check-in at our hotel and sleepily visited this hipster coffee shop to kill a few hours. The girls working the front were extremely friendly, making us feel very welcome in their shop. The \"nature's adderall\" cold brew we all got woke us right up, giving me a second wind and new life. They have an NES inside and corn hold and a ping pong table outside. We came back a few days later because we all felt there was no way we leave Cleveland without a second visit to our favorite coffee shop in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I wish I could add a sixth star just for their socially conscious direction. I hope to see more restaurants like this in the future. The food was delicious and tumeric latte is amazing. I wish there was one in my neighborhood so I could eat there all the time."}
{"text":"The staff is amazing. Truly make you feel at home. The food is tasty, healthy and fresh. A great location makes the choice to stop a no brainer. My favorite is to stop in on the way to a meeting. l cozy up to the bar and order a delicious cup of their slow pour coffee. Breakfast, lunch or a happy hour beer is worth it too. There is also no place better for a casual meeting spot."}
{"text":"I've been to REBol a few times, and you can't go wrong with any of the bol combinations! Even during a busy Friday lunch, my food was ready within 5 minutes. The staff was friendly, the restaurant was extremely clean, and the food was delicious and healthy. Plus, their cold brew is ON POINT."}
{"text":"yeah ill pass and stick with chipotle.  first mistake, i attempted to go here during the RNC. Second mistake, i attempted to only give myself an hour lunch. third mistake, wasted $18 on something i didnt even really enjoy.  Its miniature in there, like i love little cozy spots, but perhaps because it was myself and 500 trump supporters from texas in there, it got a bit stuffy and their air flow wasnt ideal. the line was out the door, which i assumed was because of how awesome the food was, but i was wrong. For having just opened, and for  being a main place for RNC clients the service was horrible. The staff wasnt well trained, had EYE been the manager i would have made sure they had a 2 week intense training to prep for the opening especially during such a huge time for cleveland. That put aside i was disappointed.  Its a bowl place, bowl concept,  you can get rice or greens, and a protein. I ended up just getting chicken, $10 just for that. and when i asked if the other toppings like flavorings were extra the lady wasnt sure and was clueless, she kept saying \" let me find out\"...lady you have 100 people in here and your unsure? I also got a side of sticky wings, which were not even edible without a fork, knife and a 500 count pack of baby wipes for the mess i encountered.  They  have a coffee bar, or pour station which after getting a headache from the line, the heat and the service it was well deserved a cup of coffee. It was good. Great selection.  All in all, i was EXTREMELY disappointed. Granted it was during the RNC, i will attempt to give this place ONE more shot, but if its the same outcome i will definitely take my money to Jgumbos or chipotle where i know i can get exactly what i want with a knowledgeable and friendly staff."}
{"text":"First of all Great job Cleveland! The redesigned Cleveland Public Square space is beautifully designed for a stroll through the park or a relaxing space to read and study.    I had the beef bol with shirataki noodles, green beans, and the spicy Harissa yogurt sauce.  It was delicious! The beef is nice and tender while the Harissa sauce is a must try for anyone who likes spicy food.  The fried wonton chips were a great change in texture for the bowl!  What really blows me away about Rebol is the awesome atmosphere they have created for people to sit outside to eat, enjoy a game of ping pong or cornhole.  Rebol also boast an awesome coffee and baked goods selection that I am excited to try next time!"}
{"text":"Food was good exactly what I ordered online. My order was complete in 5 minutes and a text message was sent. However I was almost run over by one of the employees  in his little red car as he drove up on the sidewalk to park near the building. Please be mindful of pedestrians we have the right away ON THE SIDEWALK."}
{"text":"Had lunch for the first time and let me say, Wow!  What a very different menu with a lot of items I have not seen before.  I love the bowl idea and the healthy menu.  My lunch was the Bulogi Steak bowl.  It came out hot and fresh and lightning fast.  The people working were all very friendly and very knowledgable of their products.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"When I went there for the first time I had no idea what I was doing, luckily Chris was there to help me put together my order and it was amazing. Chris was great and I've already been back again to try the breakfast that Chris also recommended. Highly recommended along with amazing customer service that go above and beyond."}
{"text":"Delicious food and relaxing atmosphere in the heart of downtown. I got a steak Bol with BBQ sauce and it was perfection!"}
{"text":"I went back to rebol after last review and the food was really good! The staff is super friendly and I just found myself going back! They are pretty awesome and I will def recommend to friends that will be in the area! Good job guys!"}
{"text":"I had a great experience at Rebol with excellent service and the food was delicious and not as pricey as I had thought it would be due to the high quality! Very cool and eclectic atmosphere and awesome location! The patio with the ping pong tables and flower beds embedded in the seating is really cool too! I definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is awesome on all levels. I walked in to a cool looking interior decor then was greeted by the nicest girl at the cash register who kindly explained the concept behind their menu which is unique. I ordered the grilled chicken with bbq sauce, rice, spicy green beans and topped with scallions. This has got to be one of the best things I've ever eaten and only $8! Plus healthy! My son got the wings and loved them. The organic sodas were also outstanding. My fave are grapefruit and orange! We sat outside on their picnic benches watching kids run through the splash park and people playing ping pong. Great fun atmosphere! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Excellent location!  Great atmosphere.  The food was delicious and the homemade soda's are fantastic!  If you're in downtown and want some nice outdoor seating, check out rebol!"}
{"text":"I am not from Cleveland, but I stopped in last time I was visiting the area. I was immediately drawn in because of the design, both inside and out. I am so excited about them offering non-gmo dishes, I usually have to go to the store and cook for myself, you can really taste the difference. The staff was friendly and helpful when answering all of my questions I had about the menu, and I am glad someone suggested to take home one of the chocolate chip cookies, because it was the best cookie I had ever had. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Honestly. Where can you get great food. Listen to music. Play ping pong while enjoying the heart of Cleveland downtown?  Public square is magical and Rebol is part what makes it that way. Thank you for making Cleveland that much cooler!!"}
{"text":"Wow, I was a bit skeptical based on some of the reviews, but also excited, knowing that Rebol is connected to Townhall on W.25, which I LOVE.  Rebol did not disappoint.  A co-worker and I went a bit early, prior to the noon lunch crowd.  I ordered the \"create your own\", she chose one of the listed options.  I started with the zucchini noodles, topped with chicken, papaya & carrot slaw, spicy green beans, Soda BBQ sauce , cashews and scallion.   This combination was SOOOO good and my total was just $7.  I left full, and happy.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ummm this place right here, Fire! It has to be the healthiest food option for a decent price around downtown. Now, it does take a few visit to figure which combinations work for you when ordering a Bol but the other options there are amazing too!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite go-tos for a quick lunch away from work. Lots of GF options + for a reasonable price. The kale slaw is delicious + the steak/chicken is always prepared perfectly. Definitely looking forward to warmer CLE days to spend eating on the picnic tables in Public Square!"}
{"text":"Honestly, the food is just okay (Tuna Poke Bol, served with sticky rice, harissa yogurt, scallion, papaya slaw & sides of 3 crispy wonton chips and 3 small steamed tortillas, $9). I would give it another shot though since the restaurant is new, beautiful in a trendy pop-art way, and a big attraction for the new Public Square!  ----------  FOOD:  I ordered the Tuna Poke Bol -- what better place to get some good raw fish than a hip, trendy new restaurant dedicated to organic, non-GMO, healthy fad fresh foods? Unfortunately, the tuna was a little fishy, the sticky rice mushy, and the entire dish soon became soggy as the excess liquid from the shredded green papaya slaw (with red onion and maybe carrot?) soaked into the food and through the paper bowl. I also didn't get much from harissa yogurt sauce. Overall, the flavor was very flat -- only sweet, maybe a little tangy, and really noticeably lacking in salt.   Although I found the deep fried wonton crisps ironic for a place selling itself as healthy, it did add the nice crunchy texture and saltiness that were both missing from the dish. The scallion garnish provided a much-needed texture and flavor boost as well, as well as a great pop of green color against all the orangey colors. I ended up eating everything with the wonton crisps, and ditching the tortilla -- more softness and sweet for a dish that has enough of that.   I appreciate that they use only quality ingredients and charge reasonable prices. The dish is very boldly colorful like your surroundings, which is cool.   ATMOSPHERE:  This was wonderful! Modern and trendy, with friendly service. Bright and bustling, as expected in this prime location, which also reflects the vibrant, bold swatches of primary color. Sleek, modern and cool, with the wall made of glass showcasing Public Square, the ceiling of protruding wood, and modern pop art depictions including of hip Einstein graffiti-ing the wall. There is outdoor seating as well on wooden benches.   P.S. Some of the early food pics here on Yelp and the menu presented in the various news articles online don't reflect the true menu offerings -- the menus here on Yelp are accurate."}
{"text":"As a French in Cleveland, I am just done with my first experience at Rebol and I'm already excited to go back soon. The 100% non GMO food is the highlight of the restaurant and it sounds so excited to know that we can find that kind of place in downtown now. The concept of creating our own bol with a large choice of ingredients is awesome. The employees are really nice; They gave me a lot of explications concerning the menu.  There is also a large choice of coffee latte. I tried the Honey Vanilla one and I literally don't regret it !  Plus, the restaurant has a very cool atmosphere. What else ? Definitely a good place to try !"}
{"text":"Rebol is the best! They are up on all the cool health food trends that you might expect to find in a bigger city, ie- bone broth smoothies, poke bowls, zoodles, turmeric lattes, yada-yada...however their food actually tastes great! Additionally they serve a small selection of beer and wine. Plus how cool that you can sit down and enjoy your meal outside at Public Square? They even have an outdoor ping pong table. Eat good, feel good, be a rebol."}
{"text":"Came here for Cleveland Supper Club, had a blast with everyone as always. This place offers such a laid back atmosphere and allows you to observe all the hustle and bustle of public square while you sit at the picnic tables and enjoy. We went on a Wednesday at 6:30 and had no problem finding a table outside for the 9 of us! Only complaint is-given the location, the crowd can get kinda sketchy and we were approached for money a couple times. (not fun while sitting at dinner) but it happens. Staff addressed the issue though when he came on their property, I appreciated that. Adorable, unique decor on the inside-I commend a restaurant who has a passion and a heart and lets that show through their architecture and design!  Food - this stuff comes out FAST! Decently priced which is nice ($7.50) and I was served a generous portion-I feel like your portion depends on what you order in your bowl! My order: heaven, just imitate it and you'll be happy. Pulled pork, jasmine sticky rice, napa slaw, soda bbq sauce, spicy green beans, scallions, toasted sesame, herb salad. Heaven, I even had left overs, others didn't. I also LOVED the crispy wonton chips, would have liked more so I could crumble them all over my bowl-yum!   Bottom line: If you're in the area and its a nice night, come sit at Rebol, get food that you know is sourced right and fast, and enjoy the kids playing in the water or live jazz music like we had. Always something going on in public square, why not enjoy the views from a killer patio with quality food and drinks?"}
{"text":"I can not get enough of this food. Not only is it healthy it actually taste awesome and surprisingly better than \"GMO\" dishes! Such a relief to have so close to work and even with a line out the door I still manage to get in and out quickly with my melted mocha and bulgogi steak bowl. Definitely a must try at any time of the day. Two thumbs up Cleveland for choosing this as the featured public square restaurant."}
{"text":"This is the best food I have eaten downtown Cleveland. I live in Warehouse District and it is nice to know I live only a block away from a HEALTHY , NON- GMO, ORGANIC  meal. I have eaten there probably a dozen times and each time the.meal was perfect. Try the tuna."}
{"text":"Space is cool.  Food is lack luster.   I had the tuna poke bowl. It was extremely Bland, no real textures or flavors. It was def missing something to make it stand out."}
{"text":"First, let me get this off my chest - The World Health Organization, the American Medical Association, the National Academy of Sciences, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science have all declared that there's no good evidence GMOs are unsafe. Stop believing junk science and internet fraudsters, people.  Second, make sure you check in to you can get your free coffee.  The Schtick: They claim a 100% non-GMO menu and they use organic ingredients \"whenever possible\". No refined sugars used in their dressings/sauces/oils and they cook with coconut oil. Generous use of terms like Paleo, Vegan and Gluten-Free.  Does all this mean low calorie? Definitely not. But it will make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside while you're stuffing your food hole. It also has something of that pseudoscience/homeopathy vibe, but I just tried to ignore that. I was hungry.  Moving on.  I don't give a shit about whether or not someone uses GMOs in their food. You probably gathered that from my statement above. Anyway, what I do care about is eating healthy when I can, eating fresh, whole foods, and eating stuff that tastes good. With most things that are \"good for you\" falling into the I'd rather lick the bottom of my shoe category when it comes to taste (I'm talking about that abomination called kale), it was nice to find a place that doesn't.  After driving around Public Square several times in a vain attempt to locate this place, we finally found it. The little food station is nestled in a big, grey box smack dab in center of the city. If you can't find it, look for the new water sculpture. It was raining, cold and practically deserted when we stopped in. I think it was a Tuesday afternoon. The place was practically empty. Yay.  It smells amazing inside and the view of the square provides for some optimal people watching.  The owner of Townhall in Ohio City is behind this urban eatery and it has sort of the same hip, trendy, urban feel to it. I am neither hip nor trendy and the most urban thing about me is a well-worn Naughty By Nature cassette I bought back in high school. Whatever, at least I felt that way for a little bit while I was eating here. The food is all about the bowl. Essentially, it's take some kind of rice/green and top it with a protein, pour on a sauce and serve it with some slaw. Everything has an Asian spin to it, so expect some heat.  You can build your own bol or opt for one of their pre-designed creations. There really isn't much else to the menu other than some smoothies and broth-based soups, but that also makes for some rather expeditious ordering.  I opted for the BBQ Pulled Pork Signature Bol and it was excellent. Super-tender and juicy marinated pork on top of sticky rice and alongside some cabbage slaw. The crispy fried wonton chips were nice edible conveyances. Overall, it was a pretty sweet dish. The fresh slices of pepper added some welcome heat and the cabbage slaw was creamy and slightly bitter.   My wife, going with the kitchen sink approach, built her own bol - braised pork, squash-zucchini noodles, bacon aioli, pickled veg garnish and sides of both the cabbage and green papaya and carrot slaws. She really enjoyed her meal as well, but the latter slaw \"wasn't my favorite\".  The grilled carrot and jalapeno hummus plate was also very tasty, but for something with \"jalapeno\" in the name I really wanted more heat. It was also underseasoned for my taste. I did like the addition of the chili oil, though, and I could nosh on those crispy wonton chips all day.  Remember when I told you about the free coffee when you check in? Well, I went with the Turkish pour-over. Cardamom, cinnamon and nutmeg, black. Incredibly aromatic and velvety smooth. I could drink one of these every day and complain only minimally about the $3 a cup charge. Does coffee taste any better if it's made on a brewing system built by robotics engineers in Brooklyn, NY? Not really. It does, however, taste damn good.  That's about it. Rebol is definitely a deviation from the norm when it comes to the whole fast casual thing. Slightly Asian, slightly west-coast, a bit hippy left-wing, but ever so tasty. I have a feeling that it gets very crowded during peak times, and given that the inside only seats about 30 people (there are picnic tables outside, too) it's gonna get loud and cozy.   I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Vegetarians rejoice, you can eat here and there is more than just  one thing on the menu for you to pick from ! I know, shocking right ? Well I felt the same way. But before we get into it, let me say the service was awesome!  Just great friendly people and staff and the gal (whose name eludes me) went above and beyond to help us out. The food menu is pretty much the same as townhall which in itself should tell you it's awesome. They brew Phoenix coffee and not the foul burned Starbucks swill and that's always a plus.   The location is great,being right next to public square, amd especially makes for fun people watching. They have a ping pong table and cornhole boards outside which are fun addition especially around these summer days"}
{"text":"Their food is so good and it is so cute inside. They get really busy though so be prepared to wait a few minutes. They normally have it under control though. Parking is tough, there are lots around and street parking but it can be hard to find. Great keto options as they have zoodles and miracle noodles. The flavors are great. It's not expensive but a little more than I want to pay for lunch. Its definitely worth it though. So delicious."}
{"text":"Underwhelming meal at a place i had high expectations for. I stopped in for lunch with several friends while visiting downtown attractions. We ate outside on the square, a really nice atmosphere with nice picnic tables complete with pretty planted flowers.    The food was actually good, it wasn't so much the taste I was disappointed in, but the presentation and the portion sizes were lacking. I ordered the chicken bowl with a kale and cucumber base and topped it with several of the topping options. The purple cabbage and Asian slaw  were both delicious but only about 3 bites in amount. I think they could've filled up the bowls with some more toppings for $9.  Even Chipotle does a better job at that. The only redeeming value of the meal was the free coffee with Yelp Check-in!  I should also add that two of my friends got the Tuna poke bowl and it definitely would be a disappointment if you were expecting a poke bowl. There was only a couple cubes of tuna and the toppings are not \"poke bowl\" toppings."}
{"text":"Rebol you are an awesome concept both in theory and execution!  Now the idea is simple a few choices of organic proteins and NON-GMO veggies and sauces that allow you to create your own \"Bols\". You can also pick from a few Signature Bols like the Vegan Falafel (which I had) or others like the Tuna Poke my colleague had. All are made fresh and more than reasonably price for the quality of food you are getting.  My Falafel Vegan Bol was absolutely delicious it was comprised of kale & cabbage slaw / miso cabbage / hummus / jalapeño green curry and pickled veggies. The cabbage is pure perfection! A perfect smokey, crunchy incredibly delicious bite of food. Now add that to the green curry, hummus and falafel and you have food porn in a bol!  My friends Tuna Poke Bol also looked delicious with a big portion of some of the freshest tuna I've seen in a while!  So if you find yourself in downtown Cleveland make sure to pay this place a visit.  Ps. Rebol, if you're reading this give me a call if you ever decide to franchise ;-)"}
{"text":"I am always impressed by the quality and freshness of the food at Rebol. All natural and non-gmo ingredients make for a top notch meal. You can't go wrong with building your own bol or try one of the pre-created options if you're indecisive. I highly recommended the Rebol chicken and street corn. BUT, regardless of what you choose, get extra yum yum sauce!!!! There are so many options that will keep me coming back for more and more.   They also have done a great job catering several events I've attended. They provide everything you need for an amazing feast. If you want to give your crew a memorable experience and not just the same boring catering, don't look any further.... Rebol has got your back!   Rebol is located right in the heart of public square with a modern and inviting outdoor space! If you are downtown you definitely need to stop by for amazing food and a fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Amazing food + staff and speedy service. What more can you ask for? With vegan, paleo and gluten free options, I love that this place fills you up without giving you a food coma!"}
{"text":"Good food upon first try. Just opened this week and they have been slammed at lunch, but the staff held it together for the lunch crowd. Kudos! Excellent food and worth the wait at the pickup window. I was looking for vegan so I got the #3 Zucchini with jasmine rice since they were out of noodles. No problem since the staff was gracious.  Also enjoyed their soda water. A very nice pairing."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to go to Rebol because there's a lot of meat on the menu and some ingredient combos that I'm not familiar with. However, I am so glad that my friends wanted to go because it forced me to try it  - and it was wonderful!    I built my own bowl: fresh zucchini noodles with turmeric vinaigrette, avocado/sweet potato salad, fresh corn salsa, and falafel.  All the ingredients were fresh and challenged my palette. The guy at the counter seemed to know the menu well and was able to recommend what would taste good together and what would not mix.  I appreciated that the zoodles were crisp and thin like pasta. The vinaigrette was added just right and had a light, zesty flavor, which was nice on a hot day.  The corn salsa had some type of orange sauce on it, which was different than the typical corn salsa I've had at other places. If you like avocado, then you'll love their avocado/sweet potato mix - it's like a new twist on potato salad without the heaviness of traditional potato salad.  My only complaint was the falafel - while well done, it was spicy!  I was extremely full after my veggie bowl and am pretty sure we will be coming back to Rebol more than once this summer when we visit Public Square."}
{"text":"Rebol catered our daughter's birthday today party and everything was perfection!!! The food was delicious and they were so generous with their portion sizes!!! They accommodated all ages, from children to adults with the variety of food options that they provide! The setup was incredible and very professional(food was warm for the entire party). Our guests could not stop raving about the bowls and selection!! We are especially impressed with how they also accommodated the multiple food allergies we had at our party- they kept track of everyone's allergies in order to provide options that were safe for all of our guests!! Our experience with them was excellent from start to finish - from the hospitality and service during the ordering process and until the cleanup!! The manager, Adam, and his crew were awesome and we are so appreciate of their efforts to make our daughter's first birthday so perfect! We highly recommend them for any event and will only be going to them from now own for all of our future parties!!! Thank you so much!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place ever since it opened. They've got a really cool set up where the whole front of the restaurant is transparent glass looking out onto the center of public square. Decor is super hip and they have awesome outdoor patio seating with a ping pong table.  Menu is small but everything sounds really unique. I ordered the bulgogi steak bowl and my boyfriend had the REBol chicken. I didn't like either dish. The jasmine sticky rice was very sour and they gave you way too much rice and way too little meat. The slaw on the side was all vinegar. I've had authentic Korean bulgogi many times back home in NY and this is not that bulgogi. I'm not sure why they even call it bulgogi because it was cooked in curry sauce and I couldn't taste any traditional bulgogi marinade at all. The only tasty thing was the deep fried wonton chips, but how can you mess up deep fried anything.  That being said, I did not try the any of the coffee or smoothies that a lot of the other people were stopping in for. I'll probably come back to try the drinks but will not be ordering the food again."}
{"text":"Had a decent, though inexplicably expensive, lunch at Rebol (pronounced like \"rebel\") during the Republican National Convention.  Despite the heat and humidity, the outdoor seating provided prime placement to take in reporters, conventioneers, and protesters alike.  I had the Bulgogi Steak and a box of water.  The meat had a hint of seasoning to it but was rubbery and tough to chew--not something I would recommend to others.  The brown rice and curried papaya slaw were filing additions, and I really liked the crispy wontons and warm corn tortillas.  A pager system lets you know when to pick up your food and helps relieve congestion around the pick-up window.  I do wish I had looked at my check a little closer, though, because, after tip, my order came to $16.  If the website is accurate that the Bulgogi Steak is $8.50, the lesson learned is to steer clear of those boxes of water.  Overall, despite the pricing and disappointment on the food side, the location pushes Rebol up to three stars.  (And since Yelp is now featuring Pokestops, dining at Rebol should put you within range of three Pokestops, as part of the 10 Pokestops and 1 gym in the immediate Public Square area.  Happy hunting!)"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I really liked the idea of having fast pace healthy non-gmo food. I may have ordered the wrong thing but I didn't like their chicken with the tikka masala sauce. I expected a lot more flavor but basically got something that tasted like spicy rago. The kale salad was really good and my husband really liked the chicken. So I gave it 3 stars its okay but nothing special."}
{"text":"Hey Johnny I really didn't want to leave your place a bad review but the young lady who took my order was extremely rude. She was cute but cute is not a excuse to be rude to paying customers."}
{"text":"When Rebol first opened I had high hopes for this place. I love the concept and the proteins and sides are great. I've  eaten here 4 times now and I must say there has been a gradual reduction in quality at each visit. Initially the product was great, but at each visit they provide less of the protein to the point of it being ridiculous. I really hoped it would improve at each visit, but no. This was a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"Stopped in here during the RNC protests to cool off and get something to eat as I was starved from riding my bike around everywhere Downtown that week, every day. I had some pork bowl thing and it was really good and the price wasn't bad from what I can remember. My only complaint would be that they had the tortillas wrapped in foil and they were hidden under something so I didn't see them until the end. Not the end of the world. The food was fresh and the flavors were great. Cool little patio outside with a stone ping pong table and a bunch of Bier Garden type benches. I would definetly come here to eat again."}
{"text":"Great/tasteful food for lunch (had pork-filled bowl) still, and was quickly served with place not that busy in early afternoon."}
{"text":"Super cute, friendly, hipster (but not in a pretentious way) informal yet healthy AND yummy breakfast/lunch/dinner spot next to the fountains. great location within the park with plenty of outdoor seating and even table tennis available too. i LOVE that it's walking distance from the convention center so you can escape typical over-priced fare and get nourishing fresh food to take good care of your body. i ordered the breakfast bowl with steak, which, while pricier than i typically pay for breakfast, was totally worth it since it's made with fresh ingredients, great texture of mouth feels and flavors, and left me feeling happy after every bite. along with the steak, the bowl came topped with 2 freshly cooked sunny side up eggs, bok choy, sweet potatoes, raw onions (which i thought was weird at first but gave a nice crunch and spiciness), mushrooms and soft cheese. they also currently have a check-in for free pour-over coffee (w00t!) and even subbed a delicious berry tea for me since they unfortunately don't have decaf (and i'm breast-feeding). the berry tea was really flavorful and delicious... and even better that they not only offer cream but also coconut and almond milks too!  of note, food is made to order so not good if you need super fast food but worth the wait, worth a journey over."}
{"text":"Visited Rebol last Sunday evening after the Cavs game.  I had researched Rebol quite a bit and was thrilled to try it as they have many gluten-free options, and take a lot of pride in the quality of their ingredients.  Ordering process is simple: go to the counter and place your order and go have a seat.  They will give you a shout when your order is ready and you go back to the north side of the counter to pick up your food.  Our order was ready in under five minutes and the guy behind the counter was very warm and helpful.  Rebol is very trendy inside, outside is a ping pong table and corn hole, and the location is amazing as this is basically a pod dropped in public square.  We both order a No. 7 Rebol Chicken Bol.  This comes standard with sticky rice, kale slaw, scallion, and Tikka Masala sauce (think creamy spiced tomato sauce).  We both find this dish pretty solid, but by the end of the dish the tikka masala sauce had become a little overwhelming.  There are many other menu items we are interested in trying though.  We so appreciated the location, quality of ingredients, inside decor, price, and helpful staff that we will definitely be back again for round two."}
{"text":"The peanut butter mocha is interesting and good.   The tuna poke bowl is a little weaker -- relying too heavily on dressing, and the accompanying vegetables (cucumber, pickled red onion) are not really suitable for poke.  With WiFi, electrical outlets, lots of seating, and friendly staff, this place makes for a good workspace though."}
{"text":"Great lunch, good prices.  Portions are generous.  Had the steak, meat was good quality, better than expected for $8.  The scenery was nice too and I'm not talking about the recently renovated public square."}
{"text":"PROS -Unique offering. I like that you can get food (rice bowl stuff), breakfast (daily), coffee beverages, smoothies, alcoholic beverages and the like here. It is so random, but somehow it works here. -No GMOs. And sourced locally when possible.  -Sensitive to lots of different types of diets. Gluten-Free, paleo-friendly, vegan, vegetarian. And even though I fall in none of those categories, I feel like I am eating healthier because of it :P -Location. They are not near Public Square...they are IN it. Love that the seating outside is right by the new fountains. Or I can just walk to the other side of the square and have a little picnic.   CONS -Limited food menu. I've only ever had great food when I've been there, but I've only ever been able to select from ~6 things (at least the bowls). I am not creative enough to create my own bowl, though that is an option. -(Indoor) seating is limited. It's a small place, but that should not stop you from trying it out. If it's a nice day, just plan to eat outside! And if it's a crappy day, just get it to-go.  BOTTOM LINE -Public Square isn't just a destination to take selfies with the statues or fountains...it's also a destination for some pretty amazing food, too!"}
{"text":"Rebol definitely left a great impression on me. Such a great environment right as you walk, super friendly staff, and a really cool design inside between the art on the walls and the intricate ceiling design. I got tangy chicken, sticky rice, spicy green beans, cabbage slaw, sesame mole sauce, chow-chow, sesame, and cashews. Definitely a great addition to Public Square, and it makes it that much better that they are organic and non GMO. Love the \"Make America Healthy Again\" hats, really clever. I'll be back for lunch again very soon!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for coffee while in Cleveland for a conference last week. It's a cool place! The interior is vibrantly designed and it's situated right in the Public Square, making for a nice view.   My coffee was good and came in a nice, uniquely shaped mug that was very comfortable to hold (sorry I love good dishes!).  I was hoping the muffin/pastry selection would look a little more appealing, though the cinnamon muffin I had wasn't bad. They also do accommodate a few different dietary needs/preferences if that applies to you.  I would go back!"}
{"text":"Rebol is an upscale fast casual restaurant that, like its sister restaurant TownHall, is 100% non-GMO. They also are mostly organic and offer many gluten-free options. It is a great place to eat downtown that is tasty, affordable and heathy too. It may be tiny but it packs a lot into the small space. Craft beers, cans of wine, cocktails, smoothies and hot drinks are all top notch. When the weather is nice, grab a spot on the patio for great views and people watching.  Don't miss the pour over coffee, peanut butter and honey milkshake, turmeric latte and the bahn mi pork nachos."}
{"text":"Yummy. The zucchini noodles, the chicken, and the drinks are awesome.  It's pricey, but worth it and the atmosphere is fun- music indoors and out. Right on the new public square so often there are events, concerts, and kids running around- a lot to see and do before and after eating."}
{"text":"ACTIVATED BEEF BONE BROTH  MOROCCAN LAMB  Wow very impressive  Friendly staff Highly recommend Paleo gluten-free options"}
{"text":"Mediocre food, I got a bowl with sticky rice and chicken covered in soda BBQ sauce and I wasn't impressed. If I'm in public square and I get hungry I can take a short walk to numerous restaurants and get a much better meal. Honestly I don't think this place is going to last very long. Public square is Cleveland, I wish they would have put in a restaurant that truly represents Cleveland."}
{"text":"Decided to give Rebol another try after my underwhelming first experience and I'm glad I did!  I ordered the No.6 Pulled Pork and was wowed by all of the different flavors going on.  Forget the pulled pork, the star of the dish was the Napa slaw which was mixed with creamy and delicious yum yum sauce! Rebol definitely worked out the kinks they had. The wait wasn't long, there was more sauce and the flavors awakened  every tastebud.  I'm definitely coming back and I'm looking forward to trying the other dishes."}
{"text":"I stumbled across Rebol when I was looking for lunch and saw a bunch of people walking around with Whole Foods like containers. I love bowl food so I knew I was on to something great!   The restaurant is such a cool space on a nice day. I think it'd be crowded if it was a rainy or cold day but the ability to sit outside by the fountain is awesome. Ordering is an easy concept with the steps neatly laid out, which makes it super efficient. Lots of foods that meet special diet requirements (gluten free, vegan, paleo) and at $9-10, a really great value considering the quality of the food.   I didn't try any but Rebol also has a wide variety of specialty sodas and coffee drinks. And crunchy ice!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a very strong hipster vibe, with its wide variety of customizable drinks and food bowls. I really liked the drinks - I got the matcha tea with chocolate milk and it had some very unique flavors. Food wise, I would say overall it's like a more upscale Chipotle with better, healthier ingredients. I got the banh mi nachos which were really nice, though I wish it had come with some rice to be honest. My girlfriend got the bulgogi, which tasted honestly more like well done steak than bulgogi but it wasn't too bad. The rest of my friends all had the poke and did not like it, though I didn't have the poke myself so I can't really form an opinion on that.   Rebol in many ways is similar to Noodlecat - it is an American establishment that has its own spin on Asian style dishes, while also serving unique coffee and tea drinks. Based on how my Asian friends reacted, it's not the type of establishment meant for people looking for authentic, traditional Asian food, but if you approach the restaurant with an open mind then it can definitely have its own appeal."}
{"text":"So glad to have came across this poke bowl like place. The service was friendly, and delivery was prompt. The downtown settings sets the mood."}
{"text":"Rebol is always a great time with so many options: Vegan, vegetarian and straight carnivore.  Nestled in the perfect spot in downtown, Public Square, Rebol is a hit and attracts so many people. There's something here for everyone, and it's healthy too!  The help is great. The ambiance and colorful decor/walls make the experience even better and brighter. I instantly feel better when I walk into Rebol. They are fast, friendly, efficient and knowledgeable of what they do.   TOP YOUR BOWL with HARISSA YOGURT. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Yum! Great value for the quality and taste! Much better than local competition; much healthier! I keep going back for more."}
{"text":"Rebol was a must visit spot on our trip to Cleveland! The food and drinks were amazing and the hospitality was even better, thanks to Paige and Chris!"}
{"text":"Rebol is such a hidden gem located right smack dab in the middle of public square. Their create your own bols are tasty, healthy, and filling. I love their selection of coffee they offer as well. If it weren't for the location, I would be here much more often! Every time I go it's such a treat. The workers are helpful and friendly and I've never had a bad meal from here! Also... I learned today they are dog friendly!!!! Which is really good to know. Check this place out and enjoy"}
{"text":"Rebol is a hip, swanky noodle hut plunked down right in the middle of public square. Patrons were amused by the decor the other day (Lincoln in 3D specs, though incongruous, looks ready to ascend to de facto mascot status) and the variety of options. The build your own bowls are just right for vegetarians (the vegan chicken is delectable if a tad meagerly portioned), packing a whole lot of sweat-inducing spice per cubic centimeter. At $7 or so, they are one of the cheapest quality lunches in town, though don't expect to leave feeling epically sated--that ain't Rebol's mission, apparently. Instead, these fine bowl-ers focus on quality. The noodles are fresh and so too the fixings to top your luncheon (looking at you, cilantro). You'll have to answer a dozen questions about your bowl specifications if you build your own, however, sending one hungry guest into paroxysms of exasperation. Still, Rebol is quick (even with a frightening line at the counter) and their offerings are nothing if not flavorable. There is ping pong outside as a bonus though you'll need quarters to buy a ball. Otherwise just chill and watch folks cavort about the fountain."}
{"text":"SO glad I found this place, as it meant I could eat healthy food while in town for a convention, instead of the horrible food served at the convention center!  Their espresso is on point.  I had the green curry signature bowl for lunch and they were happy to make substitutions.  I was here twice today, (once for coffee, once for lunch) and will go back tomorrow also.  Very friendly and welcoming staff.  Easily walkable from the Hilton."}
{"text":"So excited about the opening of Rebol in Public Square. In order to ensure an accurate rating, I've refrained from writing a review since the fast-casual restaurant opened its doors in July. However, Rebol has consistently remained one of my favorite lunch spots downtown. As a student at Cleveland State, I have limited time in between classes during which I am able to stop somewhere for food. That being said, Rebol is perfectly equipped for the efficiency that is necessary to accommodate to these sorts of time crunches, as I'm sure many who work/study downtown have during their lunch hour. Not only is the food quick, but it is also full of flavor and allows for options that cater to different sorts of dietary restrictions and flavor profiles. As far as coffee goes, Rebol is hands down my favorite place to stop for a solid cup of joe. Each cup is brewed individually via an electronic pourover system that guarantees the perfect brew each time, as well as guaranteeing fresh coffee that hasn't been sitting on a burner all morning (as somewhat of a coffee connoisseur, this struck my interest, so I inquired about it with the barista one afternoon). Not only that, but the coffee is organic. Coffee beans are generally a crop that receives heavy pesticide-use, and knowing that I'm not ingesting these when I drink my daily caffeine-fix is as soothing to the mind as it is to my caffeine cravings.  Do yourself a favor and stop in."}
{"text":"Rebol is a pretty cool spot! I love its location. It's perfect for folks on lunch break who work in the area. It's fast food with lasting nutrients as opposed to any of the fast food chains. A little pricy but worth it. The raw juice I had was delicious and I had a chia seed with fruit like parfait thing that was delicious and substantial. If you don't work down there it's still a great place to check out on an afternoon they have some picnic tables that sit right in public square so it's a perfect place to stop in the middle of the day while I'm downtown!"}
{"text":"Ten out ten, recommend to a friend, and order again and again!! I frequently order takeout in the morning for meetings. So fast, always delicious, and so good for you!! From the coffee to the food I've never been disappointed. The breakfast bowl is my favorite; loaded with bok choy, mushrooms, sweet potato, egg, and everything wonderful. While my coworkers seem to love the overnight oats with chia seeds and maple and the yolk and swine with thick cut bbq bacon. And you can not forget about the banana chocolate flax muffins; moist, dense, and vegan friendly!! Tonight I finally had the opportunity to try their lunch/dinner menu. Went with a BYO Bol; chicken, grilled veggies, miso purple cabbage, tikka masala, and some sprinkles of love on top. The juicy chicken has a mouth watering charred flavor which paired perfectly with the charred cabbage and grilled veggies. And the cabbage, by the way, had the coolest deep purple coloring which contrasted so beautifully bright scarlet red of the spicy tikka masala. Wish I had time to take a picture but I basically inhaled the whole \"bol.\" So tasty and really aesthetically pleasing.  Can not wait to order again!!! Thanks for always impressing me with your yummy eats and quick and friendly service."}
{"text":"Fresh, organic, yummy food! Golden milk is super creamy and tastes delicious. Falafel bowl with zero carbs is nice if you want to try an alternative low calorie dish."}
{"text":"I've never had a single bite of the food, so I can't comment on it. I work third shift, and like to have a beer after work. Downtown, it's either rebol or the casino. The casino has a bit of a weird vibe at 8 in the morning, so I end up here. Great service, good beer available, and best part: they don't give me the usual judgemental attitude for ordering beers at 8AM."}
{"text":"Rebol is a great addition to the area! They have enough of an assortment for multiple audiences. Electrolyte water, coffee, craft sodas, milkshakes and alcoholic beverages.   I stopped in while waiting for a dinner reservation and the staff was happy to chat about their products and recommendations. I just tried the blueberry coconut water but it was perfect for the hot day, simply sweet and delicious.   Outside they have cornhole and ping pong- the paddles are inside and the ping pong balls were $0.25 to play from a machine.   I look forward to more warm days to walk over here for drinks. The craft sodas especially sounded great!"}
{"text":"Rebol's innovative and straight-up... good. I only spent a night in Cleveland and don't have much for comparison around the area, but if you stuck Rebol in NYC and LA, I'm sure it'd be a hit.   The location itself is on-point, right next to Public Square, with ample indoor and outdoor seating for tranquil, warm-weather days. The restaurant itself is what I would call modern rustic and well-decorated. You can order via a kiosk or at the counter, and there are multiple options for signature or build-your own bowls, pastries, coffee, drinks, and bone broth. They've really been up-to-date on the paleo/keto/vegan/etc. lifestyles, with options including shirataki noodles and tahini cashew cauliflower.  I opted for the vegan falafel, and the combination of flavors and textures was unbeatable, with hints of crispy coconut from the falafel juxtaposed with spicy coconut undertones from the green curry. Throw on pickled vegetables and hummus, which actually sounds like a pretty odd combination (I guess they're going for the melting pot of cultures vibe), and you've got yourself a winner. My only food complaint is that I wish the falafel was baked. With all the sauces, the meal did feel pretty heavy.  There was a little set-back with the service in that I guess too many people ordered too many falafel bowls at once, and mine somehow went missing (I think someone took it initially?), but calling out our names for the orders as opposed to the items might make it less confusing."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and coffee. Only thing is don't get a chai latte, was just straight steamed milk. Other than that very happy. Especially with the breakfast egg bun with bacon, very danky"}
{"text":"I'm shocked this place is \"brand new\" and already has 80 reviews on Yelp! A lot of time, effort, dedication, and Love obviously went into this place. I was immediately impressed by the sign on the door \"A BIG $#*% OFF TO GMOS! People are not a science experiment.\" And then even more impressed when we walked in and the interior was covered in signs that said affirmations like \"BE ACTVE BE HEALTHY BE HAPPY\" and \"EAT LIKE YOU GIVE A DAMN\" (very Thug Kitchen- style). I wanted so badly to take a picture of the staff's hat that said \"MAKE AMERICA HEALTHY AGAIN\" but thought that might be weird  very clever utilizing one of our current Presidential campaign's slogans. I was thrilled about the reverse osmosis water!!! I almost went back later that day to get more ... I got a cup of it complimentary because I ordered food. I ordered some kind of paleo smoothie but requested the dehydrated bone broth be removed because I am vegan. It is very obvious that the owner of this place is paleo because a lot of the menu items are paleo-inspired. Therefore the \"healthy\" aspect of it is subjective. I personally do not consider animal products of any kind \"healthy,\" and def not the \"cinnamon cake muffin\" or the fast food-reminiscent breakfast sandwiches layered with white bread, egg, and sausage. My kids ate the egg and bread separately but were not really happy with it. I wish this place offered more options for children. I really wanted to give it five stars though because I just have to commend them for putting together such a beautiful restaurant, and for at least trying to help transition people over to a healthier way of eating."}
{"text":"This is a really nice new, casual space.  Very quick, healthy options for lunch or a quick dinner.  I had the shirataki noodles (no carbs) and chicken topped with spicy green beans and broccoli.  Good flavors.  Also, just a very nice space in front of the Public Square fountain.  The outdoor tables are all in direct sunlight, but I'm guessing the city may not allow umbrellas there."}
{"text":"Cute and industrial, this little joint had food if tremendous quality. The staff was friendly and helpful to this first timer. Definitely a repeatable place!"}
{"text":"I ordered the vegan bowl with a side of the avocado sweet potato \"salsa\". It was very fresh, flavorful, and delicious. I also had the vegan brownie which was AMAZING! Next time I'm in Cleveland, I'll be coming back to Rebol!"}
{"text":"Best lunch I've had in a while, excellent choices for your build your own, I tried the cucumber noodles with chicken, with the sweet potatoes and mixed vegetables with a little yum yum sauce and it really hit the spot, great location to eat and enjoy public square, definitely will become a weekly lunch spot for me"}
{"text":"Overpriced and basically a let down. If you want vegan or gluten free this is your go to. If you want good go elsewhere"}
{"text":"This place has a great ambiance, location, food, and coffee.  It was just a pleasure to have breakfast here during our vacation.  I would highly recommend their breakfast sandwiches and lattes."}
{"text":"The rebellious establishment bringing awareness to the food you are consuming and that the city needs now is here in  Public Square, Rebol. Rebol, as the name relates to, is a one of a kind, Non-GMO restaurant that provides safe and healthy food options; as does is its sister restaurant, Townhall, on West 25th street in Ohio City.   This 2,000 square foot establishment, which is located in front of the infamous Tower City, packs a punch with its limited space. The \"Andy Warhol\" like decor embodies what Rebol stands for to me, standing up for what's right and being firm and convicted in your beliefs, which is what they have done with making an entirely Non-GMO menu. If you are unaware of what this means, research it or read the educational information the restaurant has to offer inside.    The decor is as bold as the food and rightfully deserves a 5 star in every aspect, which I rarely find worthy. This public square hub not only is bringing the community together to eat healthy, but educating them as well on the food you should be consuming, only NON- GMO's.  This is a reasonably priced, casual trend setting restaurant. Whether you are looking for their organic coffee pours or delicious food at any of time of the day, even on your 6 a.m commute, it's here waiting for you. Their menus also provides a wellness guide to keep you updated on the options for those who have dietary needs or personal preferences relating to food that is vegan and gluten free or Paleo friendly.  Today, I tried the Immunity cold press juice and built my own 'bol', which I highly recommend doing so and picking the Bulgogi grass-fed steak, Jasmine sticky rice, spicy green beans, and soda BBQ sauce. Let me tell you, that BBQ sauce is now the best in the world. It is safe to say, for having the most expensive meal on the menu at $8.50, I'm craving for more and my bank account doesn't hurt.  To say I'm impressed by the work and concept that has went into Rebol is an understatement. It's a beautiful sight to see the community being educated, eating, enjoying one another's company and even playing outside together, thanks to Rebol."}
{"text":"Small, unique, and delicious menu. I love the atmosphere and it fits in nicely at public square. A lot of places close early on Sunday's or are closed completely. However, rebol has really good hours and a great staff. I enjoy coming here to relax and enjoy the outside."}
{"text":"Stopped by Rebol for lunch with my cousin and the food was every bit as good as I remember. I ordered a chicken bowl with miracle noodles, veggies, tikka masala sauce, and street corn salsa.  While I waited, I treated myself to a Black Cherry cola. Damn, their soda is good!  A few minutes later, our food was served. My dish tasted amazing. The chicken had an excellent flavor and the noodles picked up the flavors from the tikka masala sauce. The food was fresh and absolutely delicious.   Our two bowls plus two drinks was $30. Ouch. This is the most expensive lunch I've had in a while. It's not worth $15 for lunch, but the food does taste excellent."}
{"text":"I always try to be generous in all of my reviews but I have no other choice than to plainly state my experience.  I was traveling to Cleveland as part of a business trip and wanted to relax with a refreshing drink.  I saw the rave reviews on Yelp and was excited to try and find this store.  Unfortunately, after I arrived at the store, all the doors were locked, despite still having customers inside.  I was certain that I came before closing time as the closing time was listed as 8 PM.  I tried to open the door but was told by one of the workers that the store was closed.  Alas, my plans were ruined and I was forced to return to my apartment, thirsty, and without refreshment.  My advice for all the other customers would be to make sure the store is actually open before coming here.  Edit: It turns out that the manager that night wasn't supposed to close early.  But when I explained the case in person, the staff was very accommodating.  Also, the decor during the daytime is very inviting."}
{"text":"Best coffee in cleveland, my home away from home, adrian and Chris are always super friendly and helpful"}
{"text":"I was staying at the Renaissance this weekend for a wedding and was in desperate need of a morning pick me up. I found that Rebol was a short walk away and gave it a try. I immediately noticed the beautiful array of outdoor benches on the square- Atleast 5-6 benches that could fit 4-6 people each. If it wasn't raining that day I would have loved to spend more time outside. As I stumbled into the coffee shop, I was immediately impressed with its modern, clean design. The menu options were a mix of classics + unique twists on those classics. I ordered an iced matcha green tea with mint and coconut milk. It came to $5 which was pretty reasonable in my opinion given the milk substitute. The flavor of the mint wasn't strong, but I could tell the matcha quality was excellent. My friend ordered the cold brew- I tried a sip and it was a bit bitter for my taste, but perfect for his. I more of a smooth, nitro cold brew kind of gal. Overall would recommend this place if you need a quick drink during the day- if it's nice out, I'd recommend getting a bench and enjoying the scenery of square."}
{"text":"Had the chicken bowl with tons of delicious sides! My friend and I both ordered complete different items and we both raved about the flavors and ate every last bit of it! Fresh and healthy eats! Can't forget the Peanut Butter latte with sea salt!! Incredible!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time on a sunday afternoon for lunch. The atmosphere inside is small but very fun and colorful. It is very welcoming! There is a little bar area looking towards the kitchen and also high tables. There is an area where kids can play video games that is hooked on to the tv.  And if you go outside there are wooden tables and they have ground water foundation where kids can play. It is a very family friendly place. They have a lot of options for coffee and they also sell smoothies. I ordered their chai latte and if you want alcohol beverages they have a few options from beer to wines. The chai latte was good!  I got two things from here. The first was the rebol nachos which i heard many good things about and the   the rebol chicken with added jalapenos and scallions (which is not extra) . I loved the rebol nachos! The chips are very different they are not like a regular tortilla chips! The chips were warm and tasted amazing with the all the flavors and protein that you can choose. I choose the chicken as my protein and they gave you a very good amount of it. The chicken also had a lot of flavor to it! The only thing I didn't like was the bacon aioli that was on top of the nachos. I personally don't like aioli or things that are creamy and I would get the nachos again but without it! My rebol chicken was very good! It came with sticky rice, tikka, cabbage slaw, street corn, scallion, and crispy garlic. The combination of those ingredients made this dish very good . It was light and refreshing with the cabbage slaw and street corn and the tikka sauce was not heavy at all. Overall this dish is something I would come back for again. I wish there were a lot of more options besides the couple ones they have but I would definitely come here to try other dishes! The prices itself isn't the cheapest but it is worth trying it!"}
{"text":"I was out catching Pokemon last night in Public Square when I developed a hunger. REBoL is on the doorstep of the new splash pool at Public Square. The food is non GMO. The staff was very cheerful and helpful with explaining the menu. There is a list of pre-made bowls with a base of usually rice or leafy greens. There is also a customize your own option. They have cold pressed juices for only $5 in smaller bottles instead of the usual $9. The soda fountain has purified sparkling water which is right up my alley. Public Square has come a long way from the hot dog vendors serving up tubed meat floating in stinky hot dog water."}
{"text":"First time at Rebol and had a great experience! The staff was so awesome and the food was even better! I would recommend the bullet proof coffee to anyone. Will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"What an exciting concept! Fusion at its finest. I tried the pork/soda bbq/ jasmine sticky rice/candied jalapeño combination and it was delicious. I can see other options in each of their bowls fitting in nicely with just about any combination of could think of. On top of that I feel great about the fact I'm putting in healthy non-gmo food into my body. It didn't stop there. I tried one of the vegan/gf brownies and have to say it may be the best brownie I've ever had. Hats off to the crew at rebol and the city for letting Downtown open up to new ideas."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast on Sunday morning.  We were visiting the city. They made us a vegan breakfast bowl which was delicious. Lots of veggies with falafel.  Staff was super friendly.  The tea and coffee were very good too.  Will certainly stop in again soon."}
{"text":"Public Square's new eatery, REBoL, is a great spot for lunch and your morning coffee.   lunch/dinner The menu is anchored by bols; there are six choices of signature bowls or you can build your own. I tried the Pulled Pork, my favorite, and the Bulgogi Steak Signature Bols. The pork was flavorful, juicy and tender. Both bols were based with a rather generous portion of sticky rice. The other ingredients are served in a deconstructed style.  For an appetizer to share, or a meal in and of itself if eating alone, the Bahn Mi BBQ Pork Nachos are great. Really, I would not change a thing about this dish and will order it often.  drinks I'm also super excited to welcome a new coffee bar to the neighborhood! REBoL has a full coffee menu. The Turkish Pourover makes for a delicious afternoon pick-me-up. The pourovers are made each time to perfection with the use of Poursteady, a really nifty automatic pourover machine. I want one! The espressos are just as good: rich, thick, slightly chocolatey and delicious.   I also love that REBoL has chosen to be another restaurant where you don't have to sacrifice on health to eat there. The menu is non-GMO and organic. And most importantly for me, the sauces are free of refined sugars."}
{"text":"It's a little expensive for lunch but the quality of the staff, food, and cleanliness make the price more reasonable. The staff is really friendly and they're constantly cleaning and making sure you enjoy your experience. The cucumber noodles were good. The falafel isn't very traditional, but it's a good level of spicy and flavor. There's free wifi and clean restrooms. A good amount of seating indoors and out. There's even a ping pong table outside!   They brew Phoenix coffee which is also a little more expensive than other coffee places. Rebol acknowledges that it's overly hipster and has the prices and options to back it up. Good place to treat yourself!"}
{"text":"This is a very unique place and much different than I had expected. It was a bit confusing upon arrival on whether there was a line to order or whether you just walk up to the bar area. The menu seems to have a lot of fresh and healthy items AND ADULT BEVERAGES. It is pretty nice to be able to enjoy an adult beverage outside at Public Square. It's about damn time this new concept has hit the Cleveland market.  The only downside to this place is that there are homeless people that just pop a squat right next to you, while you're eating and stare at you. It was really uncomfortable to watch one guy sit right next to a father with his child, and then after they left, he moved on to our table. I know that this is a public space, and he is welcome here just as much as anyone else, but it truly does effect the atmosphere and experience."}
{"text":"This place is seriously phenomenal, both the coffee and people.  The Pourover coffee is a must-have.  A great find in Cleveland.  Also had the Breakfast Bol.  The food is on-point.  Can't wait to come back and have lunch one of these days.  Great job to the team at Rebol."}
{"text":"Such an awesome restaurant in the center of the city! I went to into rebol not knowing what to expect and let me tell ya...I was blown away!  The environment and service was amazing.  Such friendly workers and fun, upbeat music and vibe.  I tried a variety of food and everything was flavor nation and absolutely delicious. I highly recommend the pulled pork nachos - probably the best nachos in all of Cleveland!  Also the milkshake is heavenly. It seriously tastes like ice cream pie.  I can't wait to go back to rebol and try breakfast!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful location! It is perfect for a quick lunch. You could tell everything was fresh and healthy. You don't go back to work wishing for a nap. It was a nice change. I ordered the Tuna Poke ($9) it was pretty good!"}
{"text":"Pretty good, quick meal. I made my own Rebol with sticky rice, chicken, sweet potato and avocado pico, sesame and scallions, with a bacon aioli on the side, and it was good. You can tell the ingredients are fresh, but I generally thought it was more Instagrammable than anything. I would go back but, I may try a different combo. My combo sounded good on paper but didn't hit the spot. Good sized portion though. Fun alcohol options too, and a great outdoor atmosphere. Ping pong table! Will definitely try their coffee and breakfast options."}
{"text":"Awesome organic coffee shop on Public Square directly in front of Terminal Tower. Great place for the downtown lunch or afterwork crowd.  Looking for a delicious and healthy meal?  The \"Rebols\" are awesome and come out quick.  Grab yourself a healthy smoothie or craft beer too!!"}
{"text":"First time visiting and I had the Tuna Poke Bol. Everything I had was fresh and delicious. This is a great space as far as design goes and so far it translates to the food as well!  Great location in the beautiful new public square. Can't wait to visit year round and see the changing surroundings."}
{"text":"I was in town for the week and went exploring in downtown. I went during late afternoon so there were barely any customers there. The decor is great! The outdoor patio is fantastic! And the service is very friendly. I had a nice experience at this place and could see it as a great lunch spot. I've been into this whole Poke phase and was looking for a place that served raw fish. I tried the tuna poke #1 and found the flavors to be rather interestingly tangy. The papaya slaw was hard to finish, the tanginess was off-putting. The flavor of the wonton chip had tasted like it was still drenched in its cooking oil (maybe that's how it's suppose to taste) and the sticky rice had stale parts like rice from the bottom of the rice pot, it's not the same texture of sticky rice at other Asian restaurants that you're used to. The flavors of the papaya slaw and tumeric vin cashew tuna did not blend well together. There's some missing to balance the tangy flavors.   I love the concept and what it stands for and everything did taste healthy but I will probably order something where I could create my own flavors next time. The coffee tasted great and watching the pourover coffee was something different, def a great spot for a coffee run."}
{"text":"This has all the makings of the hottest new spot. I got a cup of broth to sip while I was people watching and was ready to enjoy the hipster vibe. I was really disappointed with the saltiness and peppery taste of the broth. It was too overpowering and it was almost like Campbell's. I would be willing to try this place again as I would like to imagine it was a one off batch. I like the atmosphere in this place so it gets a 3."}
