{"text":"Great ambiance, wonderful food, interesting menu, good service, nice wine selection - and right in the neighborhood! How luck are we?!  It's right up there with all the creative restaurants in the Central Corridor.  We had the crab cakes, the pecan crusted chicken and the meatloaf.  All wonderful.  Unfortunately (for me) the dessert was awesome.  It's going to be hard to pass on dessert on our next trip there!"}
{"text":"Very good ! I would give a five stars if they were serving some nice bread with our meals and the chicken was a little on the dry side but other than that, the food came out pretty quick for lunches."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! The service is incredible, and so is the food. We went for Sunday brunch and the mimosa's were the best! Great atmosphere and very welcoming to their customers. Can't wait to go back again. Will take friends and family there for sure. Thanks you guys! You deserve 5 stars for sure!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went in last night (Friday) to give this place a try. We got there early enough to avoid a wait but it was already full. We were glad that we did not have to wait for a table. The atmosphere was great and they had live music, which we weren't expecting. I ordered the Cajun Shrimp Alfredo and my husband got the stuffed Poblano, which our server recommended. We also got the asparagus as an appetizer. Both of us were very happy with our dishes, the food took a little long but our server brought us bread and we had our appetizer to munch on. 

The reason for the 3 stars instead of 4 is that we had to wait over 15 minutes for our drinks, which we ordered when our server greeted us. Our appetizer made it out before our drinks and by the time we got the drinks, we both were already frustrated with having to wait so long. I ordered a glass of the Pinot Noir and my husband got some type of margarita from the specialty drinks menu. We both normally get 2 drinks when we go out but we were only able to enjoy a few sips of our drink before our dinner made it out. The waitress was for very apologetic and explained that the bartender was backed up. However, as a table of two with pretty easy drinks, we both thought it was a long time to wait. It worried us both that our food was going to take even longer but the food came out in a timely matter (with the appetizer before the drinks!) 

Overall, we both decided we would still go back again because we did enjoy the atmosphere and the food was delicious, just most likely would not be getting drinks."}
{"text":"Had the Cesar wedge salad with chicken...it was delicious! Great service as well. We live about a block away and will definitely be back again in the near future."}
{"text":"The place has a faint, but unpleasant smell when first walking in.  It smells, I hate to say it, sewer like.  After about a minute, you stop noticing it and certainly the smell alone is not worth shying away from the place. 

The food was pretty good.  I had the burger, which was very good.  Nice thick flame grilled patty that was well seasoned and was accompanied by two generous and well cooked bacon slices.  Burgers are solid.  

The kids menu choices were not great.  The portions we small by kids standards.  The pizza dough was very thin and soft like a pita bread (or Naan to be more specific).  The kids spaghetti was bland."}
{"text":"(2.5 stars). 

Enjoyed Sunday breakfast this past weekend with friends while visiting from San Diego, CA. Creative food and drink menus. 

The operation was surprisingly amateur compared to the creative menu and interior build out.

* Disorganized. 15-minute wait turned into a 45-minute wait with roughly only 25% of the tables occupied.

* Dismissive attitude -- this must be the rogue part of the experience. Ordered at the bar to pass the time and an unfriendly woman in a black t-shirt chided me about not being a bartender and not serving drinks. She seemed unaware of the nearly hour long wait times.

* Amateur service levels. Beverages were not refilled during the meal. Server seemed interrupted and surprised when refills were requested then delivered a Bloody Mary instead of water. Breakfast was served without the condiments (ex. waffle with no butter and syrup).

* Overcharged / billed incorrectly. Was charged for a Bloody Mary I didn't order. Paid for it but would not recommend eating here, if you don't have plenty of extra time to wait in line then watch staff running frantically in a mostly empty venue.

Maybe the staff was new. There were only 5-6 tables occupied between 3 servers, a runner, and the rogue manager."}
{"text":"Yay! Finally a nice little bistro in Glendale's Arrowhead Neighborhood. This wonderful new little addition to our neighborhood is very close to MidwesternUniversity and Honeywell. Tonight we celebrated my nieces birthday. What a great little place. The staff is so courteous and friendly. They really make you want to hang out awhile. We started with the cheese and chorizo dip with pretzels and it did not disappoint! Yum!! The asparagus was really good too . I had the mahi taco's and my niece had the chicken lemon pasta... Everything was really good. Great job Rogue Tomato!! Welcome to the neighborhood! We hope you stick around awhile. Please support our West Side businesses. Reward them for NOT opening in Snottsdale."}
{"text":"My husband and I popped in for a random night out for dinner.... we were NOT disappointed.  

We sat at the bar and shared the pretzel and chorizo appetizer. Delicious. Alicia, our server was great. Very attentive but not overbearing. 

My husband ordered the ribs and I stole a bite. They were very tender and moist. The sauce was sweeter than we expected but tasty. 

I ordered the Rogue Burger. I could only finish half. The aioli was spicier than I thought it would be but the fresh avocado cooled it down. 

Overall. We had a wonderful time and left in a wheelbarrow.  ;)"}
{"text":"Been here many times. Food is made fresh from scratch. Healthy choices. I love salad with salmon and the lunch special of half portabella sandwich with salad and great fries. Must try!! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"I've been here four times: brunch twice, lunch once, and dinner once. The food is excellent. It's inventive and perfectly prepared. The cocktails are also amazing. So for food: 5 stars. But oh, RT, get your act together with your service! The waiters are pleasant enough, but we just waited fifteen minutes with three other parties (one of which left) to be seated in a nearly empty restaurant. After we ate dinner here, we moved to the bar to get a drink, and waited at least ten minutes for a bartender before we left without ever being acknowledged. I hope they fix this because I really want a good place to eat in NW Phoenix, and again, the food is delicious, but if the service issues aren't addressed, I can't see myself recommending this place to friends."}
{"text":"Seriously so good! Just finished Sunday breakfast here and will definitely be back. I had the breakfast frittata and my husband had the huevos rancheros, both came with their rosemary potatoes. Everything was seasoned perfectly, and we enjoyed everything. Delicious!"}
{"text":"We've now been to The Rogue 3 times since they've opened, twice for dinner and once for lunch. We like to support the local places as often as we can, but of course it has to be good. For us, it's been very good on all 3 visits. 
The decor is quite nice, great ambiance without being too dark. Nice bar with great cocktail menu and fantastic craft beer. Try the Deschutes IPA! 
The menu has something for anyone and done with an eye on being a couple of steps above your average bistro style restaurant. The crab cakes are amongst the best I've had. We've ordered them every time we've been in. I've had the bone in ribeye, the flat iron and one of their burgers and all have been excellent. It seems to be harder these days to get any restaurant to grill a steak to the desired temperature, but both times the kitchen hit it perfectly. My wife really enjoyed the pecan crusted chicken on one visit and the veggie burger another night. My wife's standard for a veggie burger is the version found at Houston's, and The Rogue's comes closer than anyone's. 
Don't leave without trying one of their desserts. The flourless chocolate cake is very good but I don't think I've ever had a better carrot cake. We've had it on two visits and the second time we took a piece home, as well. Trust me, maybe the best carrot cake you've ever had. 
The service has been solid and likely will become more polished as they progress. What we liked is the chef/owner came out and greeted our table and genuinely wanted our feedback. Nice to to see they care about making their place as good as it can be."}
{"text":"Lemon ricotta pancakes are delicious. 
Rosemary breakfast tomatoes were amazing. Fiancé also loved the rogue frittata. Cool atmosphere. Service was a little slow - we will be back."}
{"text":"Just discovered my favorite breakfast place. Opens early at 6:30. Great food and very friendly service."}
{"text":"Came here tonight because I've been waiting for this place to open near my house.  Started with the guacamole and chips for an appetizer which was great.  I ordered the vegetable lasagna for dinner and my friend ordered the Mahi Mahi tacos.  Both meals were delicious and very flavorful and fresh.  For dessert we shared the creme brule.  Will definitely be back!!!  It's great to have a restaurant like this in Glendale!!"}
{"text":"Tried out this place for the first time. The food was good, but average for the price."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh, well-made food. Great environment. Tasty seasonal cocktails. & the bill wasn't cringeworthy. Strongly recommend."}
{"text":"Great food, nice atmosphere, and friendly staff! Delicious, homemade food. I highly recommend the 59th Ave Burrito for breakfast. It's a monster!"}
{"text":"everything I've tried has been amazing and so fresh. guacamole is one of the best I've had. never had a bad experience here"}
{"text":"They're dinner was just amazing! I highly recommend their guacamole for an app! I love how it's kind of like a downtain Phoenix hipster restaurant that's made its way to Glendale! Finally! :-D The only downside to this place is that it's tucked in the corner. I feel like they have amazing food but need to be more visible. Course that doesn't beat the food :-D. Oh and went to their breakfast, and that was also just as delicious. Everything I've ordered here was superb!"}
{"text":"Brunch menu is great, good prices, service is good but can improve.

I have tried about a third of the menu, no disappointments so far, I love the 59th ave burrito and the veggie lasagna."}
{"text":"Stopped in for brunch last Sunday for our first time at Rogue Tomato. Was very pleasantly surprised. I really enjoyed the atmosphere. I felt comfortable and liked the live soft guitar music. Had the basic 2 eggs, toast, bacon and potatoes. Loved the seasoning on the potatoes, fresh jam for my toast and the bacon was great. Can't wait to go back and try lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Went in for dinner with my fiancé and we had such a wonderful experience. The bartender Andi is not only friendly, but also funny. She asked questions about what we liked and even offered samples of wines/beers we hadn't tried so we could find our favorite. I know now that she makes the perfect Prickly Pear Margarita. She and another server Brittney were attentive and seemed like a dynamic duo. I will definitely be here next week for Monday Happy Hour that lasts all day! YAY us. I'm soooo happy that this restaurant in near our home and can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the posts about having a dog friendly patio. I came with my wife and our dog and asked how long the wait would be for patio seating and that we had our dog with us. First, the hostess stated there was another dog on the patio, to which I asked if there were rules about having multiple dogs on the patio. Then, a gentleman asked if our dog was a service dog. I told him he was not, and the gentleman said that they only allow service dogs. Hmmm, that's not what the posts on Yelp say. I laughed on my way out the door. Needless to say, I'm no longer interested in this \"dog-friendly\" establishment. If you would like to go to a REAL dog friendly place, try OHSO Brewery."}
{"text":"This review is for their breakfast which I believe they just started doing recently. The service was a little slow to start and I saw a waitress help a man at the table next to us who was seated after my party was. Once our waitress did show up she was very friendly and helpful. I ordered a bloody Mary that tasted more like cold tomato soup. For breakfast I ordered the eggs benedict which was very tasty but I probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"What a wonderful culinary delight!  We started with the cask wines (vine capsule cabernet, n2 red blend, and ranch radio merlot), all were very good to excellent.  I had the red pepper bisque which was excellent with just the right amount of smooth bite. The four of us had different entrees and each person said it was great. My Sonoran filet was cooked to perfection and served with a subtle smoked chili sauce, small potato slices, mushrooms, and fresh asparagus that was slightly smoky and very flavorful. Save room for the best carrot cake any of the four of us have ever eaten (cumulative 250 years of eating cake)!"}
{"text":"Food was cold and took a long time to come out. Stood at the bar for several minutes and wasn't acknowledged by any of the 3 people behind the bar. None of them were helping another customer at the time. Watched many of the other tables wait long periods of time for their drinks to be taken to their tables.  
There didn't appear to be a manager in the restaurant that evening, had there been one there I would have expected them to come check on us after we complained about our food. 
This place has a lot to improve on. I don't want to wait 10 minutes for my drink to come after I ordered it and I expect hot food to come to my table hot and in a timely manner when the place isn't busy.  Won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in the Phoenix area. Real good food, super fresh, clean and inviting atmosphere. Our waitress Lisa ROCKED! I make a pretty good chimchuri  sauce, so i tried their flat iron steak with chimchuri, the only thing i have to say, is don't fear the chimchuri I wanted more  sause. The flat iron steak was great, my wife had a delicious meat loaf. We followed it with their carrot cake. The Best"}
{"text":"Very excited to have the feel of unique phoenix restaurant in Glendale. Great food (salmon, calamari, fish tacos, Cajun shrimp) !!!  Service was incredible ..for those prior poor reviews..come back ..our server Jennifer was attentive and prompt."}
{"text":"So we've had breakfast, lunch and dinner here.
I'd give the food a solid 5 stars, but the service is just utterly horrible. I ordered a Bloody Mary spicy that was so sweet I couldn't even drink it. No Tabasco available to try and make it at least resemble a Bloody Mary. Food took forever to come out and when it arrived it was warm at best. I'd like to say it was the \"Father's Day\" rush, but Mother's Day and every other day service is just truly not up to par. The only good service I've received here was during happy hour when the bartender was taking care of us. 

Again food is fantastic..... But I sat here and watched folks almost walk out waiting for service"}
{"text":"New best deal in town.  Dinner for two - $65 Friday night
choice of appetizer, two entrees, dessert and a bottle of wine - $65
we had the grilled asparagus for the appetizer - good enought to kill for
my wife had the beef stoganoff, I had the cajun shrimp - both excellent
followed by the chocolate torte which we actually brought home.  Enjoyed a good chardonnay with dinner.  Good fresh coffee and a little Bailey's completed the evening. Will certainly return for more Friday night dining out."}
{"text":"This place is going to be my new go-to.  My girlfriend had the Reuben (after she had a lousy one at Nosh the day before) and said it was great.  I had the salmon sliders (sans buns) and the shoestring fries. The salmon was in big cubes cooked to perfection. The fries had some kind of mild yummy flavor, while still being crisp.  Great presentation too.  My friend is going back tonight for the Monday all night Happy Hour, and she's going to get the Salmon Sliders for herself.  
We sat at the bar and Tara took great care of us.  We had a view of the big screen that was showing old black and white movies.  Very nice ambiance.  Easy location too, right off the 59th Ave exit of the 101.  I hear its run by two chefs... after eating there, that became obvious."}
{"text":"My family and I went for dinner last night.  We wanted to try as many different items on the menu to see if we would like this place. We had the steak, vegetable lasagna, cajun shrimp Alfredo, rogue burger with fries, kale salad, lemon chicken and for appetizers, we had the fried calamari and grilled asparagus. Everything was simply amazing
 The steak was cooked to perfection, sauces on each plate were delicious. We, of course  had to have dessert and again we tried the ALL of them and believe me, we were not disappointed.  The cheesecake was the best I've ever had, the chocolate torte was very rich and amazing, the creme Brule was perfect and the carrot cake was to die for.  
As for the service, it was outstanding.  Our waiter was attentive and very personable.  He was quite knowledgeable of all the items on the menu and was able to help me decide what to order.  He took time to answer any questions we had.   This is one place that my family and I will go to regularly.  
Barbara B."}
{"text":"I get the story they are going for; hip, chef restaurant, a downtown feel but in Glendale. Unfortunately, it feels like they are trying and missed the mark in one of the most important areas, the food. 

The good- 
3pm til close Happy Hour on Monday. 
The inferno Margarita - Spicy,refreshing combination of a margarita adorned with                     sweet cucumbers, slide of Jalapeño, and paprika salt rim
Host/Waiter/Bar tender (one person) - Helpful, jovial, and attentive
The table water- liked the accompaniments, cucumber, lemon, jalapeño slice,  that were on a separate plate to add as one wished 
Live events (occasionally- not on my visit)

The Bad-
The Focaccia bread first brought to the table, was extremely hard. My guess was it was day old bread. Took one bite and that was enough. 
Pretzel Chorizo Fondue- Pretzels were dry suspect they were also a day old. A smidgen of Chorizo in the dip. The cheese sauce was underwhelming lacking flavor and the consistency was off. The flour and cheese had curdled/separated and had a gritty feel. 
The HH tacos- $6 for two tiny tacos. Each Taco had a shrimp and half. Taste was okay, but certainly not gourmet tacos that warranted the $6 (discounted price). 
Server was running around trying to wear several hats. He did the best he could, but it was apparent that he had too many tasks and not enough time or help. 
Flies indoors- no one likes to swat away flies as they are trying to enjoy their meal"}
{"text":"Lunch was great.  Everyone in our group really enjoyed their meal.  Cool ambiance.  I will definitely be back! Excited to try breakfast."}
{"text":"I was really excited to come here, this is the type of atmosphere I wanted for this part of town. The food was...okay... but that could have been  resulted from the experience I got from our waitress. She was not attentive at all. Forgot about our drinks (soda) and us pretty much the whole time. Unfortunately, even tho it's down the street from my house, the experience is not worth going back again.   

I wouldn't necessarily give it 2 stars, more like 2.5 but not worth the three, sorry."}
{"text":"We have dined at Rogue Tomato for both lunch and dinner, and the food and service have been consistently excellent.  The sliders (BBQ pork, salmon) were perfect for lunch, and the rosemary parmesan fries they are served with are very addictive.  At dinner, our party tried a couple of the flatbreads, the Caprese salad, mahi tacos and the wild salmon.  Everything was fresh-tasting and delicious.  Our servers have been friendly, attentive and knowledgeable every time.

The one suggestion for improvement that I would make concerns the wine. Red wines should be served be at cellar temperature (around 58 F), not room temperature (especially in AZ!)  We had to request an ice bucket for our bottle.  A wine cooler for bottle storage is an easy fix.  We'd also appreciate a few additional bottle selections at a variety of price points.  

All in all, I'd certainly recommend Rogue Tomato.  It's a great addition to the West Valley that is so sorely lacking in non-chain dining options."}
{"text":"One of our favorite weeknight happy hours...Monday until closing!!  Crab cakes and meat loaf are amazing!  Friendly wait staff and nice ambiance. This chef-driven bistro was MUCH needed in Arrowhead and west valley. Support this place!!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal food! Phenomenal service! Love this place! The atmosphere is great and I will be back and I will definitely refer friends and family here."}
{"text":"I discovered this place based on some good Yelp reviews. If you like supporting small businesses (rather than franchised establishments) it's definitely worth a visit! The atmosphere was cool and I loved the music! Although our server (Johny) was running the bar and the dining area, he never let us see him sweat! 

The food: Yummy! Try the pretzel & chorizo  and the Rogue fries! The build your own burgers were a little dry, but what do you expect when you order it well done?

The location: Keep your eyes peeled, and don't blink or you might miss it! Our group arrived in separate vehicles and we all agreed it's hard to spot. It blends into the building and you have to be looking at the right angle to see the signage. A couple A-frame boards were set up street side, but they didn't draw your attention. If it had additional signage on the complex reader board, I didn't see it.

Overall I'd recommend this joint! I can't wait to got back when they've got live music!"}
{"text":"I took a group of 5 there today at 11:40am on a Friday and a barely silhouetted voice from the dimly lit host station told me the wait was 25 minutes. I saw a few tables open but they looked like tables for 4 only so maybe they can't put them together or something. There seemed to be some confusion at the host station and a list of names was being kept on a sticky-note which seemed tacky :-). I will likely try again, but perhaps they have front of the house issues to work out. Someone told me the service was really slow but the food was really good, so I guess it would be a place to try when you are not on any time constraints, like your lunch hour. Not that we don't have plenty of other choices in the area. Hopefully they can pull it off in the long run, menu looks great!"}
{"text":"I visited Tuesday (March 15) at 2 PM and stayed for more than an hour.  This was my inaugural visit.  Friends of mine told me about the place.

My server was Renia (Amanda).  She was attentive, polite, and friendly.

Taco Tuesday was in effect.  All tacos were $2.50 each, as was the cilantro rice with corn.

I tried one of each taco:  Carnitas, Carne Asada, and Mahi Mahi.

Tacos had small-diameter soft taco shells.

Carnitas and Mahi Mahi tacos were both very flavorful.  I liked the Carnitas so much that I subsequently ordered two more (calories don't count on Taco Tuesday!).

The Carne Asada taco was disappointing.  The steak had a bland taste, a slightly fatty texture, and was shoe-leather chewy.  I could not eat it as a taco (folded and held in hand) because I could not bite all the way through the steak.  I had to cut the steak into smaller pieces with a knife and ate the taco open-faced with a fork.

The cilantro rice with corn had a nice texture and flavor, and it complemented the tacos very well.

I had iced black tea to drink.  It was fine.

Overall, I enjoyed my experience at The Rogue Tomato.  I liked the Taco Tuesday promotion, but I think that $2.50 for each of these tacos was still a bit too pricy.  My server \"Ren\" did a splendid job.  I recommend that folks give the place a try, especially on Taco Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"I'm giving them 1 star because the service is a nightmare. I've been several times. The food is great but the employees are terrible. The first few time it was just bad service. The last time on Tuesday 9-5-2017. We ordered an appetizer and tacos. The wait wasn't bad. The problem was that the waitress came out with my hubands tacos and acted like that was the whole order. Asked her about the appetizer and my tacos. She said oh I'm sorry that's my fault. They didn't see it on the ticket. We said ok. She said she would fix it. More than 15 minutes past still no food. We asked her to take my husbands food and just bring it all together. She did. 10 - 15 more minutes pass. No food no waitress. I finally asked to talk with the manager and he assured me the food would be out soon and that my husband food was being remade. The food did come out it was another 10 + minutes. (Don't forget we're talking about tacos) The appetizer looked great. The tacos that the manager said would be remade were not remade. My husband poked a hole in the avocado on one of the tacos and that same hole was there and the tacos were so dried out you could tell it was the same plate. We ended up going to a different restaurant to eat. I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and check this little gem out. Awesome relaxing vibe, great service and the food is AMAZING. It's nice to have a locally owned business on this side of town that serves up great food with style. Cajun shrimp Alfredo and pecan crusted chicken were so good. And if you are too full for desert, take it to go. You will thank yourself later."}
{"text":"We live downtown, but were up in Glendale for a night after we dropped our baby off at grandma's and wanted to check this place out.

The ambiance is what you'd imagine from a strip mall restaurant. It appears that they're trying to be cool, but the crowd is mostly seniors.

Food:

The pretzels and chorizo cheese dip were just ok. The cheese was gritty, and the pretzels appeared to be doused in butter for no reason and way over salted.  Chorizo was nice, but there needed to be more of it. 

My wife had the Pecan \"smoked\" chicken dish which was absolutely awful. I've never tasted such flavorless chicken in my entire life. It's VERY difficult to cook a piece of chicken breast this poorly. The sides and orzo were also flavorless and unseasoned. 

I had the ribs, which were pretty delicious. The BBQ sauce tasted like it wasn't homemade which is disappointing, but the meat was cooked well. Coleslaw was fine, underseasoned. The \"vegetable medley\" was a bunch of unseasoned (are we developing a theme yet?) sauteed vegetables.

Everything is also slightly overpriced. $16 for one chicken breast and some rice is pretty hard to swallow, especially when it's so poorly executed. 

Pros:

The bar seemed cool and well laid out.

We won't be back."}
{"text":"Truly enjoyed my breakfast here, their rosemary potatoes are so bomb! Their prices are marked what the food is worth. Would come back(:"}
{"text":"Best meal, wine, & carrot cake i have ever had in the valley!  Kudos to the chef sous."}
{"text":"We were visiting Glendale to see our daughter and grandson. We all wanted to have something different and local.  We were interested by the name and close location. Upon arriving we were greeted pleasantly and promptly; being later on Sunday afternoon it was reasonable that the place was not extremely busy.  Having said that, the atmosphere and music were very pleasing and Lisa the waitress was cute and charming.  A nice smile goes along way in a new place. The menu was interesting and diverse for all palates.  We ordered the Rogue fries and guacamole for starters. The drinks arrived promptly and we ordered the entreé.

The Mahi Mahi tacos were absolutely delicious; crisp batter on the fish made the lightly seasoned slaw blend together perfectly.  Our grandson had the house special, Rogue sliders. He choose the Prime Rib style with fries. The sauces that came with the sliders were unique. Homemade ketchup and special Rouge sauce (mayonnaise-w Sriracha.)

My wife had quesadilla's and was impressed with the presentation. The taste and quality were excellent. All of us agreed that the food some of the best in the area that we have sampled. 

The inside decor was very pleasant with brown tones and and unique \"Chalkboard\" painted signage. We noticed a side area for outdoor seating that looked very inviting. The prices were reasonable and everything that was important to the customer was satisfied; prompt service, quality food, and pleasant atmosphere.

We will be back."}
{"text":"Best place in the west valley! The food is always delicious. We've had the bartender, Amanda, as our server multiple times and the service is always outstanding! She is always patient when our 5 year old wants to tell her a story, and never blows him off. The spinach kale salad is by far the best thing on the menu, what a fun combination! Don't be fooled by the reviews saying the service is lacking, because the team working last night made sure we were taken care of! If Amanda wasn't over checking on us, then the host or busboy was helping out, great teamwork! Good job Rogue!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful meal with friends and family!  The food was exceptional and the owners and staff were friendly and attentive.  Great addition to the neighborhood!  Our friends have been here 5 times and have reported that every meal was great.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I met my husband here for lunch and loved the atmosphere. It's a cool little restaurant with a great menu. I really wanted to try everything. I ordered the Cuban and my husband ordered the salmon sliders. The sliders delayed our order a bit but was worth the wait. I will definitely come back to try something new."}
{"text":"I was happy to find a new restaurant on this side of town but the food was disappointing. I got the queso and chorizo for an appetizer and it was way too watered down. As my meal I chose the carnitas tacos, they were ok but didn't have everything they said it would on the menu and way too much onions. The green salsa was amazing tho"}
{"text":"Friday night drop in. This place is new and im loving it. NW Valley needs more small, great joints. I love that its not a chain and the owners are very welcoming. Great place."}
{"text":"My family and I came in for breakfast, and it was delicious! I had the lemon ricotta pancakes, which were divine. They were the best pancakes I have ever had. The service was fantastic, and the atmosphere was great. By the end of breakfast we had to roll out of the restaurant because we were all stuffed. We highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Live in the neighborhood, thought we would try this new restaurant.  Will not go back.  Breakfast $35.00????  for Huevos Rancheros?  Took over an hour!  Service was OK, Food was OK but i can make better at home!  Tried it, will not go back.  Sorry"}
{"text":"Great food!.....less then great service. Came in for lunch with a friend on Sunday afternoon I had the salmon sliders and calamari app both were delish! But we were there for over 1.5 hours and not because we wanted to be. The service was terribly slow and had to practically beg to be acknowledged to refill our drinks and get the bill. I honestly think it is just due to growing pains and undertrained staff. Because the food was so good I will definitely be coming back to give them another try but maybe after a few months or so...."}
{"text":"I know this is a fairly new establishment, so I was willing to be somewhat lenient, but the more I think about our experience, I just don't think I could return. I guess what really got me is then they accidentally served my 10 year old alcohol. She ordered an ice tea and when she got it it tasted funny, we all tried it and it basically was alcohol. Even the waitress was shocked (yes we had her try it). I ordered the heirloom salad with chicken and it was bland. They used zero seasoning on the grilled chicken. My husband ordered a burger and it was too salty. My kids ordered the cheese pizza and they brought them out pepperoni. When I brought it to the servers attention, she apologized and took them back. 5 minutes later she returned with the pizzas that they had obviously just removed the pepperoni and added cheese too. I tried the pizzas and they were definitely frozen pizzas, not even fresh. To make up for our experience, they did offer us dessert but we declined. The positive thing about this place is the decorations. The decor is super cute and the chalk art on the walls are fantastic. Unfortunately we won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Our first time at the Rogue Tomato.  Atmosphere is decent w good music playing. The food was above average. We had the blue corn crab cakes, tomato bisque soup and the filet entree. We went on Wednesday which is apparently their \"wine night\". The bartender failed to inform us of this even though we asked about glasses vs. bottles. When I asked about it after seeing the \"Wednesday Wine night sign\" he got defensive vs. apologetic.....which is what he should have been. 

The food us decent enough we'll go back."}
{"text":"Nice place for a date (but not a cheap one). Service and food was above average. The laid back hipster vibe was relaxing and comfortable as well."}
{"text":"Husband and I were looking for a lunch place near Bell and 59th Ave. saw that Rogue Tomato was close and had some decent reviews. When we walked in they were empty at 3:00 pm just in time for their Happy Hour. I never like being in a place that has zero customers, so we were a little tentative. No worries, they have very good food especially their craft beer on tap. Unusual and excellent! Had an app of mixed things with hummus. And my husband had the Rogue Burger. He loved both. Glad it was HH pricing, otherwise a little expensive for this shopping strip. Oh BTW great service!"}
{"text":"First time dining at Rogue Tomato tonight. LOVED every bite! Started with the yummy fresh bread. Hubby had the Garlic Crusted Flat Iron Steak and house beer on tap. I had the BBQ Pork Flatbread and house margarita. We shared the Chocolate Flourless Torte. OMG! Everything was delicious. Our waiter, David, was personable and efficient. All in all a great experience. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"What the heck happened?  How can a restaurant deteriorate like this.. The burger which was my favorite is now just a \"Meh\"  The chef must have quit or moved on... If this keeps up they wont be around very long... just sad."}
{"text":"I love eating at trendy, locally owned restaurants.  Finally, Glendale has a restaurant with a downtown Phoenix vibe.  I read the back story about the owners of the restaurant. Amazing.  I could not tell you about the food because we waited, and waited and waited some more to be seated.  There were plenty of open tables, and other families were seated before us. After waiting an hour, we left. Despite living just North of the restaurant, we will not be back."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and had the bacon cheese burger. Super yummwy, hot and juicy. My friend had one of their salads and that too was very delicious.  Staff friendly, establishment clean and welcoming. Will go back again."}
{"text":"After having been here for lunch a few times we liked what we ordered.  So we entertained having dinner there.  We ordered the Salmon dish. It was (2) items only. No vegetables or potato was served with this dish. The price for these (2) items was $23.95.  We will not be returning anytime soon. There are far to many restaurants to choose from who offer this dish with all the trimmings for the same price or less."}
{"text":"Lovely place been here 3 times glad to have somewhere to go that is not a chain on this side of town. Tried the ribs tonight was delish."}
{"text":"This is what dining in AZ should be- I like seeing green chilies on several menu items!!

Finally a non- chain restaurant with inspired dishes beyond what you typically find in this neighborhood. My mom and I tried this spot in the mall behind Sonic and by Starbucks after a slow greeting at another nearby go-to.

Unfortunately we arrive for breakfast at 11:02 and the kitchen was \"switched over\" for lunch.

I opt for coffee & carrot cake... This is my dream breakfast as the coffee is hot and tasty and carrot cake not overly sweet.  This carrot cake has pistachios instead of walnuts and the highlight of this 3 layer masterpiece is the rich vanilla bean cream cheese frosting.

My mom gets a burger & fries which is charbroiled nicely though the patty was previously frozen and not fresh ground.  The brioche bun is a nice touch and the fries are hot & seasoned well.

Our server Lisa was professional, efficient, and accurate.  When she checked on how we liked our food (we said it was great!) she got a big smile on her face since we started as a tough crowd wanting breakfast."}
{"text":"So I've been here three times and have had some ups and downs. One time for a late lunch with my husband - the atmosphere is really cute and the food was good but not great. A few days later we had breakfast and I really enjoyed that - the healthy pancakes were awesome and the potatoes were to die for.  The third time we went the staff were super overwhelmed and were taking a very long time so we left. Each time we've been there the staff have seemed overworked and tired - not sure why but I think it needs to be addressed by the owners. 

Overall I do like it and I'll go back, but think there are some staffing issues to take care of."}
{"text":"My husband and I just had the best meal we have had in Phoenix in a long time.
From the appetizers to the desert- eveything was prepared fresh and was so delicious! ! 
The atmosphere was very welcoming and the wait staff was fantastic 
We will be back for sure..
I would highly recommend this to anyone.  You will not leave disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great food and ambiance here!  Glad to see a nice non-chain restaurant in Glendale that's not a sports bar or too casual. This is the type of place you may see in Scottsdale. I've been here several times and they don't disappoint."}
{"text":"My colleagues and I visited many times and enjoyed all about the restaurant. Over the past few months, things have gone down hill. Service, food quality, etc. No more breakfast. Salad ingredients are not fresh. This is sad overall. When my party asked about changes, there was little to no response from the server nor hostess. We even asked to speak with the manager. Not to be found.  Is there new management?"}

{"text":"Awesome food. Really fresh. Jennifer was an excellent server. She explained all the specials for the night and gave us her recommendations.. She was attentive and very timely with our courses. Great food and great service. The server assistant Jesse eleven was great, refilling drinks and clearing get plates."}
{"text":"Excellent chef owned restaurant. We were there for ther taco Tuesday and great margaritas with homemade desserts."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night.  The food was pretty good - not outstanding, but good.  Both my husband and I had the Rouge Burger.  Burger was good, fries were so-so and barely there.  The service was horrible.  Our waitress was very slow and never came to our table to see how we were doing.  We had to flag down other employees to get drink refills."}
{"text":"We just had the BEST lunch at this brand new gem of a restaurant.  From the moment we walked in and Chris, the manager, greeted us and Natalie served us, it was an excellent experience. Both Chris and Natalie have wonderful personalities and that made this experience even more fun! The food is to die for. My husband had the \"two for two\" - a chicken panini sandwich and tortilla chicken soup.  I had the chicken quesadilla - both dishes were excellent.  Be sure to save room for their Creme Brulee and Carrot Cake-the best anywhere!!.  All food is fresh and made on the premise.  We look forward to going back and, in the meantime, telling everyone we know what a wonderful dining experience we had. We are sooo lucky to have this restaurant on our side of town!! To the owners:  Thank you for choosing Glendale to open your wonderful restaurant.  We welcome you and hope you stay here a long, long time."}
{"text":"This restaurant has definitely raised the bar in the Arrowhead Ranch area.  First of all, it is locally owned which is a must for me.  The chef Devin and his wife have stopped by to visit during a few of my meals.  My wife and I have tried virtually the entire menu and have loved all of it.  We have brought several friends, neighbors, and relatives and they all have raved and gone back to enjoy the great offerings from this local gem.  We have had the same server, Austin, on probably 8 of our 10 visits and he has been very attentive, passionate, and personable to us.  The live entertainment is a great accompaniment to the vibe of the restaurant.

My wife and I normally do not have dessert, but it is a must at this place!  The carrot cake is second to none and has a nice blend of flavors from the ginger to the pistachios.  I have read the negative reviews about the service and can only suggest that the restaurant is new.  Trying to balance staff with with guest expectations (with no historical reference) is difficult and will be worked out with time.  

Give this place a try and get ready to be impressed!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants in Glendale!! Great customer service and food is amazing! You can't go wrong with anything on the menu!! Their fries are the best and they have great drink specials! I have yet to try their dinner but lunch and breakfast are AMAZING!! The atmosphere is nice and cozy! I come here often!!"}
{"text":"One of the best experiences we have had checking out a new place in the nw valley. Great ambiance inside. Cozy and friendly. Good happy hour prices and a fun menu with both staples and unique items. We had the Sonoran quesadilla and the pork verde. Both we great. The peach mule was also very good. Live music on Saturday's, which we are excited to go back for. Also, they have a patio. They were on top of it in terms of service."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this place...close to home and what we thought (by the name) might be decent Italian food.  FYI this is not an Italian restaurant.  

The service was slow for sure, especially since there were only 3 other tables in the whole restaurant.  We started out meal with the cheese and chorizo fondue.  It is a house made cheese sauce with pretzels to dip.  The cheese sauce looked good, but was floury and separated.  The amount of sauce is also excessive.  The pretzels were delicious!  Our server mentioned maybe ordering 2 extra pretzels for dipping since there was a lot of cheese, we were glad we did.  

My husband ordered the ribs.  I was not starving so I decided to try two soups:  green chili verde and chicken tortilla.  The ribs were good and fall off the bone, but the bbq sauce had so much vinegar!  However, their French fries were amazing!!!  I will come back just for those babies.  My soups were good.  The chicken tortilla had a strong tomato flavor which was different but good.  The pork verde was also good!  

The atmosphere was great...really nice decor and restaurant!  Someone previously mentioned a brunch menu...that would be awesome!!

I was going for maybe a 4 star....but after watching our serve chit chat with another worker for almost 15 minutes irritates me.  I just worked 13 hours and I'm tired and want to go home.  I will not come back here if I'm on a time restrictions, speed is not their specialty.  For this I go with 3 stars....will probably give them 1 more shot but time will tell."}
{"text":"This was a hidden GEM for us also. The Rogue Burger is AWESOME and all the other food is excellent. My fiance loves the Bloody Mary's here also. We go at least once a month since locating this place over a year ago. Keep up the great service and cooking the great food.  Thanks, Tom and Jennifer"}
{"text":"Amazing. My husband got the ciabatta burger and I got a salads and soup. It was awesome! And the staff was outstanding. I've been telling everyone about this place. I love it."}
{"text":"Had lunch with 2 other family members. Everyone loved their food and we all ordered something different.  It was really delicious. We did have to send back our first cup of coffee as it was not hot for some reason and it took a long time for the server to bring us another.  The ambiance was nice, bathrooms clean and seating comfortable.  The only real thing lacking for us was the service.  We seemed like an afterthought to our server and it was not busy."}
{"text":"Ok  food, horrible service.

And 3 strikes you're out..went in for breakfast giving it a 3rd chance since the place is close to home. Asked for extra crispy potatoes..received cold soggy ones. The waitress( think she was the bartender actually) apologized and brought some out that we're at least hot but still a bit soft. They forgot the toast and I waited 20 minutes for toast to eat with my dry frittata. Finally the waitress came back and asked if my toast was brought out. After I told her it hadn't and that the rest of my food was now cold, she said she would bring out a whole new order and brought me another cocktail that was \"on her\". I appreciated her efforts and she was pretty cool. I don't think the service was her fault but this place will never get my business again.

***I was brought a fresh plate of food that was cooked much better and with toast. Bartender is awesome but still not going back."}
{"text":"Went last night with a group of friends for the Monday night happy hour. We ordered the ginger margaritas, the bruschetta,  the quesadilla, and the rogue fries. The ginger margarita was strong (in a good way) but had no ginger flavor to it- still delicious though. The bruschetta was more of a do-it yourself board with hummus and olive tapenade, and minimal tomatoes and cheese. Wasn't really impressed with the spread of toppings here, the hummus tasted store bought. The quesadilla was stuffed with peppers and onions...along with all of the oils from cooking the veggies. This along with the generous helping of sour cream on top turned the quesadilla into a greasy mess. The rogue fries were great- thin and crispy with great aioli on the side- no complaints with that! Overall, great atmosphere and drinks but would pass on the food unless you stick to the rogue fries. These were all item off the happy hour menu, hopefully their full menu is more promising."}
{"text":"This is the place we have been wanting in north Glendale! The atmosphere is amazing, they did such a great job on making the place feel warm and comfortable. The servers were extremely friendly and attentive. The food was amazing. Every single person at the table could not stop talking about how perfect all their meals were. You can tell the Chef put thought in every single detail of every plate. Then came the dessert.... The carrot cake! Holy cow, best carrot cake I have ever had.

They had an amazing wine and beer selection too so we cant wait to come back for dinner and try them out.

If you are looking for a top notch place to eat, this is where to go. Simply incredible!"}
{"text":"Loved everything prepared... the Crab Eggs Benedict was fantastic and the Rosemary Potatoes were *very* tasty!  Friendly staff and relaxed atmosphere made it a great place to dine.  I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Highly highly impressed... I am such a foodie and have worked in many chef driven restaurants. The Cuban panini was spot on delicious and they were kind enough to sub out the fries for a very tasty side Ceaser Salad instead. Most Chef driven restaurants would not allow substitutions so I can appreciate this place for accommodating the guests in this way. I can't wait to come back and try everything else on the menu and enjoy the weekend live music. My son is 4 and he had a cheeseburger and fries... needless to say he gave it a thumbs up....I also appreciate the price point for kids items.. very low for the high quality we received. 
The decor inside is very updated and makes you feel comfortable. Love the chalk wall full of fun things to read. David was our server and very attentive and sweet, he made all our requests possible with no hesitation. Thanks again!"}
{"text":"The hubby, mini-me, and I went there for breakfast. The food was delicious. Took a little bit to get waited on and they weren't busy. But once the server came it was great service. I ordered the crab eggs benedict while the hubby got the 59th Ave Burrito. Oh, by the way, the hubby told me to rate them low so no one finds out about it and gets crazy busy lol. We'd like to try more options from the menu before I give anything five stars."}
{"text":"This is just what Glendale, AZ needed, The Rogue Tomato a Fresh and Fun food experience in the West Valley!

Best thing about The Rogue Tomato, it's a restaurant run by 2 Local Chefs! To me that is a true recipe for a WIN WIN WIN. Wait til' you see the food pics...

Looking for a great spot for Happy Hour? How'd you guess  - go Rogue! 3pm - 6 pm and mark MONDAY on your calendar 3pm - CLOSE. Appetizer specials and Drink specials to choose from. Live Music Saturday Nights and an amazing brunch on Saturday and Sunday.

Burgers, Salads, Soups, Seafood all at your fingertips when you eat at The Rogue Tomato!

Now the FUN. I am always looking to try anything New, Different or with a Twist. I  got my wish with the Rogue Stuffed Poblano OOH YEAH! Grilled beef tenderloin tips, roasted eggplant, charred onions, cotija cheese and served over  a yellow pepper cream...my fingers are out of breath just writing this up! Cooked to perfection with all those flavorful juices, you will be savoring every bite.

Staff is awesome and the food, go try and let me know what you think!"}
{"text":"The drinks and food never disappoint! Our servers are always in a good mood and very friendly. My personal favorite is the rogue burger or the stuffed poblano. We love coming here when they have a live band too!"}
{"text":"This was our 1st time here. Found this place on Yelp.  Breakfast was delicious. We had the huevos and centenos. Cooked perfect.  Great service!  We'll definitely  be back!"}
{"text":"OMG!!!!!   After getting a note from the owner we came back and TRIED to get breakfast today....there were 6 tables of patrons rest were empty.  We were promptly greeted and sat but once again....IGNORED AND FORGOTTEN!  We waited 5 full minutes at the table and no one even GLANCED our way!  We had the menus pushed to outer edge of table and we're not ever offered drinks or acknowledged. This was our second time here and this visit mimicked the prior.  But this time we walked....they cannot say they were understaffed because there were four gals on the floor with 6 tables being utilized we should have been acknowledged.....they never even bothered to ask why we were leaving.   Won't happen a third time.....good riddance."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised! They had great options from fish tacos to pasta to vegetarian lasagna. Staff was extremely nice and accommodating for our our large group. Oh, and the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"The food was fair. The crab cake was TERRIBLE. Had the worst service ever. Our server ignored us except to come to our table to tell us how busy she was. Extremely disappointing. I was looking forward to having a unique restaurant in the area"}
{"text":"They did a great job of decor at this place.  Other than that, it was a complete disappointment.  We waited over 15 minutes for a server to come over and we were told there were only two servers.  Servers that were there seemed friendly but were so busy that they would not make eye contact as they walked because they knew every table needed something.  Ordered the tortilla soup.  It tasted more like a bland chili.  Also ordered the meatloaf, which i was told was very good and the fish tacos.  All food lacked any seasoning and all entrees were cooked on a panini.  This resulted in a crusty meatloaf with flavorless gravy and tacos that were hard and crunchy.  There must be a shortage of seasonings in the whole restaurant as it was missing in the kitchen and none of the tables had salt/pepper.  I will try again in a few months.  Hopefully they can get their act together as this area really needs a good restaurant."}
{"text":"I went here with my mom for a little lunch. We were greeted promptly by two nice gals and seated right after. Our server, Dave, was stellar! He was friendly with a good sense of humor and knowledgable about the menu. The restaurant was quiet, due to it being a Tuesday afternoon I'm sure, which I enjoyed. To match the awesome service, the food was perfect. My mom and I both chose a sandwiches. I got the Cuban sandwich, and my mom got the southwestern sandwich. They were both so tasty we actually decided to share. If you're looking for a good happy hour, they have some delicious cocktails on their menu. I like that Uncle Bear's, a local brewery was featured. Overall a great experience, friendly staff, delicious food and I'm looking forward to future visits!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, awesome drinks, awesome atmosphere. Our waiter was also very nice and polite. He gave us a run down of the menu. I ordered the mahi mahi tacos and a mimosa. The tacos were delicious! Crispy but tender, the tortilla was thicker than usual but was an wonderful twist, and the veggies were fresh. The mimosa was strong but not overbearing, just right. My boyfriend ordered the Belgian waffle and the rogue chilaquiles. The waffle was light and fluffy and the fruit served on top was fresh. The chilaquiles meat was flavorful, tender, and crispy. Not sure if it was carnitas but it tasted like that. The tortillas were cooked just right! Overall the dish was wonderful. We're so picky with Mexican food and this place was definitely an awesome twist. Definitely will be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Was scouting for a new place and Rogue Tomato didn't disappoint. Loved the casual atmosphere. Daughter ordered the 59th Ave Burrito (chorizo, egg, bacon, potato, cheese) and I had the Rogue burger (ciabatta roll, shoestring fried onions, Aioli w/kick, passed on avacado). Good burger! Shoestring fries were awesome and daughter loved her burrito. Excellent service, non-stuffy, comfortable dining experience. Wholeheartedly recommend."}
{"text":"I really would like to give this place a better rating and review but I ordered the crab & egg Benedict for brunch and the crab was very fishy tasting and green so I ate the egg and some of the potatoes. I mentioned it to our super sweet waitress apologized and went to tell the manager. I didn't get an apology, or even and offer for something different or even a credit for another visit. Not that I'm looking to get a free meal but a restaurants courtesy should be to make sure your customers are happy, and that they spread the word about your restaurant, staff, ambiance, food and experience that others would want to visit. I visit many restaurants everywhere in the valley and this has to be one of the worst experiences I've had. The waitress was excellent! She gets 5 stars."}
{"text":"Looking for something new and not a chain in our area and this looked trendy. Great daily specials, but the crowd was a lot older than expected - average age probably 78 on a Thursday at 6:30pm, so that was odd. 

Food was just okay. Kids meals are a deal at $4.95. Prices are good, but food was kind of bland and there aren't a ton of options on the menu. Beers on tap were different choices - not the regular Bud/Coors, etc. and $2 off on Thursdays. Wine is $2 off a glass or $10 off a bottle on Wednesdays. 

We may try it again, but was hoping for a little better local place."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town. Pleasantly surprised by the sophisticated menu. The chef/owner came out twice to talk with us and make sure the food was to our satisfaction. The service was fantastic and we enjoyed the live music. Five stars plus!!!! Definitely recommend  the carrot cake topped with macerated rum raisin and pistachios."}
{"text":"Closed on a weekend afternoon for a \"private party\" with no mention on their website. I guess money talks, but we won't be back."}
{"text":"Went to the Rogue Tomato with my boyfriend & parents for lunch during the week. I live near the area and didn't even know this place was here! When we went the restaurant was fairly empty, had a cute atmosphere, fun stuff on the walls. The food was great! American food but not too heavy. We all loved our meals. I will definitely be going back to try brunch! I absolutely recommend it!"}
{"text":"We tried this place for breakfast one morning, very bad service from the start. Waiter would forget items over and over. This place is very gloomy for a breakfast spot. Food tasted mediocre, nothing special besides the  presentation of it."}
{"text":"Great local concept, farm fresh. Was excited about trying the menu. But the service overshadowed our food experience. We were a table of 12. Split in to 3 tables. Fine. Except the 2 servers didn't communicate to each other over who had which table or duty. Duplicate orders taken, then the 3rd table neglected. Then 1 table got drinks, the 2nd table- not kidding, 15 minutes past by, no mule drink or Irish coffee, 3rd table, drinks not taken. But same servers taking other tables' orders. Fast forward to the food finally arriving, food runner brings wrong entree to my friend sitting across from me. Friend tells her it's not her entree, runner gives my friend the eye roll!!! Then when friend tries to explain it's probably our other table but friend will track down who has the entree, food runner gives her the hand & eye roll! At this point we are taken aback and the food is taken away, to find out it was the 3rd table. Anyways, service was just chaotic for being end of the day and 1/2 empty. We never got our Irish coffee or mule, but was charged for it. And staff seemed to busy to check on us.
The chilaquiles i had were great. A little confused about the hashbrowns with it, but flavors were great. Just staff needs to work on their customer service."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I would definitely recommend checking it out. The huevos rancheros is the best I've ever had. The staff is great and atmosphere is super cool."}
{"text":"Always a pleasant dining experience.  The food is excellent, the servers attentive without being a pest, and the patio is comfortable.  Alicia was my server this morning and was very engaging. She made sure my dietary restrictions were addressed by offering to check with the cooks about whether or not certain ingredients were used. I highly recommend checking this place out especially if you enjoy great dining."}
{"text":"Hello hello Az this little gem has been open 4 months !!! Great food , great services, great prices , amazing live entertainment on Saturday nights. Hopping bar etc!!! Grab your dates, hubbies, friends and give it a try ."}
{"text":"Great local restaurant.  Food tasted amazing.  They have a scratch kitchen  and a good selection for everyone!"}
{"text":"This place is super good and the atmosphere is cute too. I come here for brunch often and I have had the breakfast burrito and the crab cake eggs Benedict (which is sooooo good). The service is always good. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Love the music, mellow, beautiful and enjoyed the TMC 1930's movies on the tv. Would prefer a larger menu. Would like to come back frequently."}
{"text":"First time here. The food was very good. BBQ pork flatbread and the crab cakes were delicious. Our waitress was extremely attentive and enjoyable. I definitely recommend the rogue tomato."}
{"text":"If you only have an hour for lunch don't stop here. Around 1 pm I headed to lunch with a few co-workers for a quick bite to eat. We had heard there was a new restaurant in the neighborhood and wanted to give it a try. It looked closed from the outside but it was open. There was only one other table so we figured timing shouldn't be an issue. The hostess was very polite and seated us right away. The server quickly came over and answered our questions about the daily special, taco Tuesday. We placed our order and the wait began. After awhile we motioned to our server explaining we only had an hour. After a few more minutes the food arrived and we let our server know we will be needing the check. I ordered the carnitas taco and the carne asada taco both with corn tortillas. The corn tortillas were cold, stiff and hard to eat. Unfortunately there was no time to send it back so I either ate them or went hungry. The server still hadn't returned with our check and we asked the hostess, who was refilling our drinks, if she could find out where our check was. She quickly dashed off in search of our server.  A few minutes later and well beyond the hour we had for lunch my coworker went searching for our server and asked again for our check. The server finally brought our check and we returned to work 20 minutes late. The restaurant will continue to be empty if they don't address the issues we encountered today. Customers will not return after they have an experience like we did."}
{"text":"Decent food, when it's right, but inconsistent. Staff have little, to no, personality. Returned against my better judgement, after being told they were about to close one Sunday afternoon- management  had adjusted their hours and then didn't advertise it. Came for the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes this am. They were not the same as previous visit. I returned them. Nobody cared, not the chef or waitress and management never even came by. For a restaurant \"trying too hard\" to be something , they have really poor customer service. We really wanted to like it here. It's cute, not much else nearby... but sadly, the inconsistency of the food and the lack of staff personality and clear indifference- we won't be back, and they won't care."}
{"text":"Amanda was the greatest waitress/bartender ever. Even though there were like 20 of us she made each of us feel personally accounted for.  The hostess was ready to turn us away then Amanda agreed to service all of us.  Great service."}
{"text":"I had high hopes after seeing this featured on a local food blog, but was extremely underwhelmed. The food was all quite bland (and no salt or pepper shakers to try and give the food some life), and service staff, at least during lunch, seems more interested in hiding behind the hostess wall instead of checking on the tables. I had the salmon sliders and I can't decide what bugged me the most. Was it the odd-shaped triangle dish that barely let everything fit on the plate? The overuse of fresh kale that covered up the barely could taste it lemon aioli? Or was it the tablespoon of ketchup I was allotted for my mountain of dry fries? The person I was with also had a crowded plate of bland food and questionable side of \"cilantro rice\" that featured corn as well. 

I'll chalk this up as new restaurant syndrome where they're still working out the kinks and might try again after a couple months to see if they've improved on anything. 

Although for service, even if you only have one table, peek around the corner every five minutes to check on your patrons. I think it was about 15 min of sitting and being done before I saw our server again, but heading in the other direction. Once we did get a check and the card swiped, there was no pen to sign with and the server didn't hear us when we asked for one."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, yes really, great food; but the worst service ever.  The entire process took almost two hours, not because the meal took that long, no, it was because we waited a long time to be seated, longer to have our drink orders taken, longer to receive the drinks; and still longer for our orders to be taken.  It was not that busy, there were several tables available and open, so there was no reason to almost be completely ignored (6 people).  Even the waitress herself knew she had forgotten us for long periods of time.  She did apologize, but sadly continued to do it.  Our appetizers were brought out without no plates, but that was not a problem because at the same time so was our dinner.  Then my favor part of the night, two in our party order the same entree but in different ways.  Two waitresses stood there eyeballing both for several minutes trying to figure out which was which.  And of course you guessed it, they handed the wrong plate to the wrong person and we did not realize it till we both took our first bit and had to trade plates."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch , first visit . Staff was very friendly and on top of everything . The food was fantastic and the drinks were perfect!"}
{"text":"The Rogue Tomato is awesome - great service, great food!"}
{"text":"On the fence with this one. We came here on a Saturday night and it wasnt too busy. Live music playing, but it wasnt obnoxiously loud and 
 was enjoyable. We ordered drinks and then our food order. Our pretzel appetizer came out with no delay and was great! However the fun stopped there, we ordered a second round of drinks and before we knew it our waiter came and said there was a small hiccup with our food and it shouldnt be much longer (30 mins had passed since our appetizer was finished). Well cut to another 30 minutes and there still is no word on our entrees. Finally after an hour and five minutes we asked for our check. The manager came over and it seemed like she genuinely had no idea we were waiting for so long. She ended up having our food boxed up and comped everything even the drinks. 

Now for the food review, I had the cajun shrimp alfredo and it was exactly what you would expect it to be. The seasoning wasn't overbearing and the alfredo was creamy."}
{"text":"Met up with a few of the grade school buddies for brunch this weekend and had a yummy meal!

  This place takes reservations and we were seated on time and set about catching up.  We ordered mimosas all around, some with orange and some with pineapple juice.

Brunch was still being served and most of us settled on the benedict while others opted for scrambled eggs and french toast.

We had a great time catching up and enjoyed our meals.  The eggs were cooked to a perfect consistency, the breakfast potatoes were delicious, and the drinks were perfect.

One thing that could really use some help though is the service.  We had to ask numerous times for salt&pepper and additional parts of our orders, then wait for them.  Our waitress also rushed us and seemed a bit put out that we were taking our time.

I REALLY want this place to succeed, especially since it's located in an area that is sorely lacking in good dining choices!!

Get the service thing figured out and you're 99% there!!"}
{"text":"Originally visited the rogue tomato with friends for a glass of wine and appetizers but ended up spending 3 hours there trying the different foods. All of the appetizers were great and the hamburger was delish! I plan to go back soon to try the crab cakes and a few of the other dishes. Excellent service and great ambiance."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch with my mother and the food was delicious! The restaurant is oddly very dark.. And the service isn't amazing either."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing. Every meal on the menu is delicious. I go here frequently with my family. A definite must try. Plus the restaurant set up is super cute."}
{"text":"Great new place in the neighborhood and even better because it's not another chain restaurant! Food had incredible flavor, drinks were tasty and affordable for brunch, and the chalkboard walls of quotes made for a fun atmosphere. Looking forward to returning for lunch or dinner next time!"}
{"text":"This is a difficult review. I love the ambiance, food and free music. We split a burger and it was done to perfection. The fries were good also. Service alright even though they had a lot of mishaps while we were sitting at the bar. The behind the bar area is soooo small that only one person can move around back there. The counter space is extremely limited so when the dirty dishes and glasses started piling up we thought we'd get to see them topple. I noticed the staff did not help each other out at all; showing lack of teamwork and fun. The prices are too high, that's the bottom line, especially the drinks. We can't get out of there with only 2 small drinks for under $20. If you go on a night with music, usually a weekend, they have a variety of music genres. Always quality music choices. So bottom line: Food taste and choice/ambiance/music 4 stars. Price/service/staff teamwork 3 stars."}
{"text":"We went yesterday to brunch and had an amazing bloody mary one of the best we have had in a long time. We ordered the crab cake egg benedict and the pork verde. Both of which were delicious beyond words. The issue we had was the portion size. The egg (key word) benedict was a single egg on a half of a english muffin with 85% of the plate being potatoes. The other dish was the pork verde which consisted of a cup and a half (approximately 8-9 oz) of stew with 2 massive tortillas on the side. We were not sure what to do with the tortillas as they were not listed on the menu as being part of the meal. So I ate a tiny portion of pork verde which consisted of 2 pieces of roasted pork in a very good green chili stew. Needless to say we left $54 lighter in the wallet and stopped to get some pizza since we were still hungry. What a shame that this place can produce some very good tasting food but clearly is looking to run a sub 15% food cost or less. Great if you can get people to come in more than once for a meal but we won't."}
{"text":"We were hopeful this place would be as good as the ambiance. The food was mediocre at best and the wait was ridiculous. Our drinks would sit empty for at least 15min. We waited over 30 min for our food they forgot several items we ordered when they brought our food and we had to ask 2 different people from the wait staff to bring them. So an hour and a half wasted on this place."}
{"text":"First time here... looks like it's closed but it's open!Delicious food!!! Paige the bartender was awesome! Great cocktails & food. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is one of a kind! I love the atmosphere, and you can tell the owners take pride in their place! Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Service very good, atmosphere very nice, food so \"hit and miss.\" Sometimes good, but not always. I had the Cajun Shrimp Alfredo recently. The sauce was completely broken...oily, oily, should not have been served. The shrimp had seasoning, but not spicy at all, rather bland for Cajun. Disappointing really want this place to be successful."}
{"text":"Wednesday night... 4 other couples/people in restaurant.  Nice decor,  warm, cozy seating.  I loved the chalk art on the walls.  Our waitress was new,  but did a great job, imho. Service was great. Ordered a couple cocktails... very strong and yummy.  So far,  so good. Skipped the appetizers and went straight for the dinner entrees. Glancing at menu, prices were high. Too high in my opinion.  Hubby ordered pecan smoked chicken with carrots and orzo.  Chicken was overcooked and very dry. Also a very small breast. Orzo was overcooked and mushy.  The carrots were undercooked, pretty much raw.  I could hear them crunching as he bit into them.  No joke.  His plate was a mess.  I ordered the grilled Mahi Mahi tacos.  The fish was overcooked, totally dry.  The tacos came with a side of cilantro rice.  The rice was hard and crunchy. Not good.  After our meals my husband was still hungry. His $17 meal was not enough to satisfy him.  We ended up across  the street at sports bar, so he could order more food.  Not a great experience.  We will not be returning to the Rogue Tomato. :("}
{"text":"Wonderful!!!! We came in for brunch on Sunday. The atmosphere was terrific with soft live music playing. It was me & my mother & my 3 year old daughter. They have something for everyone. The food was awesome and the service was perfect. I can't believe we have overlooked this place for the past year. It's a hidden gem! Going back very soon!"}
{"text":"The rep from Foothills Physical Therapy recommended this restaurant.  Oh my goodness so good.  We had the spinach artichoke dip, meatloaf, kale salad, shrimp pasta, and ribs plus the carrot cake!!! I give this place 5stars.  I am glad these two chefs from Sedona came to Glendale.  Not one single complaint, service was fabulous too.  They played old black and white movies too:)"}
{"text":"Great new neighborhood gem! We've been several times and the service was friendly and everyone in our parties enjoyed what they ordered. So glad to have a fresh flavorful menu to add to our go to spots! Love this place."}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped by here on a Saturday night mostly to hear a blues duo that I know and like. Not only was it great to hear live music westside, we had a fantastic time listening and dining at the bar. Our bartender, while very busy when we first got there, was attentive and had a great sense of humor, somewhat droll (which I like). The food was excellent; my friend had the meatloaf, I had what was basically a deconstructed chili relleno, which I loved. We look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"This is mine and my husband's second visit here, the first being shortly after it opened last year. I have to say that I felt the service tonight was way down on last year. We enjoyed a cocktail at the bar while we waited for our table which took about 20 mins. We were then seated at a table that had not been occupied the whole time we were sitting at the bar, which could indicate low staffing numbers which was surprising for around 7pm on a Friday. We then ordered our meals (we both ordered the Rogue burger). The food eventually came and was very good but just prior to it's arrival I ordered a glass of red wine to drink with my food. I waited and waited and waited and the place was not very busy. I eventually asked our server where it was and was told there was a problem switching out the kegs and did I want something else. I would have happily ordered something else if I had been told this right away but not now as I had almost finished my meal so I told her I didn't want one now. This may sound like a nit picky thing but the server knew there was a problem but didn't come to our table to inform me. She was at another table when I asked her and gave me this answer so she already knew but didn't say anything. This combined with a very loud table's noisy kids who kept running in screaming, and us having to ask to have our water topped up, led to a rather disappointing date night."}
{"text":"Awful customer service. Only one server works at a time. One server even used foul language while talking to us. 
We have been frequenting the Rogue Tomato for a little over a year now and I'm truly disappointed in the poor quality of service in the past few months. 
Yesterday, we had made a reservation for a party of about 12. We were called about 3 hours beforehand and told that they couldn't accommodate us. We had to scramble at the last minute to find a place to our friends birthday."}
{"text":"I give it 4 stars because the atmosphere is most definitely worth extra star. Food for lunch was decent, tho my BLT was missing the B. They brought me another. Food was a little slow, but staff very good. Food a solid 3 to 3.5.  Atmosphere is top notch. Will try for dinner and drinks, see how it goes."}
{"text":"I think this is the best happy hour in the area but I wish they had better wine deals for happy hour. The blue crab cakes are a must!  We've been here a few times in the past few weeks and will continue on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Great food but maybe a little more than two $$. Had a veggie burger, which was great, and they substituted a salad for the fries at no extra charge"}
{"text":"Has potential, decor is lacking but that's not the issue. Pretty sure half the staff we encountered were on drugs, not the slow you down kind, but the speed you up kind. Fine, but when my plate of bruschetta is thrown across the table into my wine glass I think they should calm it down. My boyfriend asked for no cheese and the waitress reacted \"negatively \", even after he said it was fine to just scrape it off. Don't get the rogue fries, they are the exact same fries you get with your meal, not impressed. As a bar manager myself, the wine selection didn't seem effective yet I was surprised and satisfied with my provisioner white blend ( as a predominately red drinker). Unfortunately we probably won't be back as the menu doesn't leave much to desire, food wasn't bad just better options out there."}
{"text":"This was our first time in! Wednesday afternoons are usually quiet in small restaurants just how my boyfriend and I like it. Our server, Heather was wonderful. She was sweet and attentive and checked on us regularly. The food was absolutely amazing. I'm super picky about burgers (beef just doesn't sit well with me sometimes) but the one I had was fantastic. The bacon was crispy and juicy and the beef was cooked to perfection. Their avocados were so fresh they tasted like they'd been picked that day!

My only \"complaint\" is that we had ordered a crab cake for an appetizer and, partly my fault for misreading, I thought there would be multiple for the price of $10. I feel like it's an odd thing to put as an appetizer. But this did not take away from the overall wonderful experience."}
{"text":"We were seated promptly and entertained by a one man show of hostess, bartender and waiter. Our waiter was a very polite young man who we decided to test in his bartending skills. He served us with a house cocktail called the Inferno Margarita which was jalapeño, liquor infused cucumbers and tequila. Definitely the best part of the meal.
The bread served to us was unfortunately very dry and so dry that the accompanying oil did not help moisten it. We also got the pretzel and chorizo dip which was ok but not particularly remarkable. We also got the shrimp tacos which was also good but not particularly impressive. Overall will return for drinks but food needs to improve."}
{"text":"Cold unappetizing food, slow service and our waiter kept forgetting to bring what we asked (like butter for the pancakes).  Cool name but overpriced breakfast and we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today with my family! It was excellent. There were 10 of us and everyone was completely satisfied with their food! If I lived in the area I would be back frequently!"}
{"text":"So I haven't lived in Glendale for 3 years now but I was back in town for graduations and Mother's Day. Normally, to get a nice brunch/breakfast meal you have to go downtown or to the east valley but I saw the food and thought alright I'll take a chance here. 

A chance well taken if you ask me as we came here for brunch and it was pretty busy. We were seated quickly and they even accommodated us with a high chair for my niece (after a few reminders but that's ok). They had some really nice options but we ended up getting the crab benedict, lemon ricotta pancakes, vegetable lasagna, and mahi mahi tacos. Food came out quickly but they gave me a regular benedict instead of the crab. I notified them and they quickly got the order corrected so I appreciated that. Portions were the perfect amount to get you full and make you feel like you got your money's worth. 

I'm happy to see Glendale finally has a good brunch spot after growing up here and always having to drive 30 minutes for brunch. I will definitely be back when I'm in own again!"}
{"text":"This has become a favorite spot for my husband and I. If you're looking for good food and atmosphere this is the place. Try the meatloaf - it's the best in town. The inferno margarita - yum. You can't go wrong with any appetizer on the menu."}
{"text":"Cool place, I went for a Sunday brunch and ordered the huevos rancheros. Can't really be too descriptive there it was exactly what I ordered and it was pretty good. The prices were like 10-15 per person so not too bad, I hear there are some cool events and I will definitely write another review when I come for a dinner date."}
{"text":"For the area, this place is pretty good food. The dining room is clean and well appointed. The bar is a bit awkward and needs more TV's to be relevant. Although it is a \"full bar\", it does not appear to be well stocked, so I didn't order my usual cocktail. The food was excellent quality and more importantly it was well executed by real chefs. The Rogue burger was cooked properly to my temp. It was seasoned properly, the bun was grilled, and the bacon was properly rendered. This makes it better than most places with the minimum wage \"cooks\" that don't care. The shoestring fries are tasty and hot. My wife's Mahi-Mahi tacos were hot and tasty although she did get one bone. Make sure you check the fish for bones before cooking! Her rice was under cooked, but who cares about rice anyway? The service was friendly and attentive without being pushy. All in all this is a good new place for dinner and lunch. They might get to 5 stars if they can make the bar look and feel a bit more professional and have more than one TV for my viewing pleasure."}
{"text":"Very good. Great atmosphere, food was very good. Portions didn't fit the price but that won't detour me from going back."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW! Great staff and great service.  My recommendation would be the Cuban Pork Belly with Hash Browns and Eggs Benedict."}
{"text":"Had lunch here and it was great! Excellent food and great service. Michaela (our server) was friendly, efficient, and did it all with a smile! I highly recommend the spinach, kale, quinoa salad and the southwestern chicken panini."}
{"text":"Here is a perfect example of why I trust YOU, my fellow Yelpers.  Rogue Tomato was EXACTLY what I expected so thanks for the spot-on reviews.

My dining partner and I were greeted warmly when we entered, and seated promptly (around 5:30pm on a weeknight). Our host pointed out that Happy Hour was in full swing, and pointed out the Thursday Burger Special; $12 for custom burger, draft beer (or soft drink) and fries.  As a side note, I noticed that \"double meat\" was available.  What kind of human being could consume that much food in one sitting?  What the what!

Anyway, both of our burgers were cooked as we requested, and the overall presentation of all the food was \"fresh.\"  You will really feel that every item is made just for you and not siting in the kitchen waiting to be ordered.

We also ordered the Rogue Fries as an appetizer and they happily accommodated our request to substitute sautéed vegetables for our fries that came with the burger.

With tip, less than $35 for two people.  Not bad.  I will return!"}
{"text":"Found this place by chance on Yelp the other day ans decided to give it a try. It is excellent. Cute, modern atmosphere and great service. The food was wonderful and inventive. This will definitely become a regular happy hour spot for us. Plus I always love to support the smaller, nonchain restaurants."}
{"text":"We really enjoy the happy hour options.  The shrimp tacos and pretzels are delicious.  We also split the Garden salad which was awesome and not the normal bland salad mix.  We like the atmosphere, it is easy to have a conversation.  A great date night spot."}
{"text":"** This place is a solid 3.5 stars. **   Almost left thinking they were closed because they keep the front screens on the windows down blocking everything out so it looks like no one is home.  You would think as they bus the window side tables as people leave, they would raise the sunshades.  Decor is super hip and trendy.  The host stand is cluttered and looks a mess like the hostess with her jacked up hair looking like she just rolled out of bed at 8pm at night. 
 Organize everything or turn it so your housekeeping issues aren't seen by your guests. Not sure about the bar, it's kind of right in the middle of everything.  There's a TV playing old movies, but it's completely obstructed by a vertical bar shelving unit.  I totally get that this is a chef driven bistro, but I am hesitant at the price point surviving in this shopping center since three new lower cost, quality options popped open in the last few months.

We had the house burger and flat iron steak.  Flat iron steak was cooked well, tender, and nice presentation.  It was on top of some flatbread, which got soggy.  Needed salt but other than that it was a nice dish.   The house \"rogue\" burger was actually pretty damn good.  Cooked perfect, nice seasoning on the meat, really good bacon, nice flavor and spice in the mashed avocado."}
{"text":"Has came a long way since they opened. They have great burgers, drinks and service. Good little neighborhood spot!"}
{"text":"A little late in writing this review, I believe my first visit was so vividly delicious that we returned the same week, well, Cinco de Mayo weekend! Great deals on margaritas, and it was live music night (every Saturday at 7pm). We ordered a 3 taco deal meal for the each of us, paired with the live music and cheap, fabulous drinks...twas a good night."}
{"text":"Got here around 1pm for brunch on a Sunday, was told the wait would be 15 minutes. Two families were seated before us, we waited a total of 30 minutes, and no one said anything to us, there was hardly anyone in the restaurant, TONS of empty tables. It's common courtesy to at least say \"sorry about the wait\" but we got nothing. Will never be coming back here."}
{"text":"This is a great little place in Glendale! We started with the calamari as an appetizer and it was done perfectly. The marinara was flavorful but the tarter sauce was amazing! Since we were here on a Tuesday, we tried their taco Tuesday special. $2.50 a taco- they have carnitas, mahi mahi, and carne asada. Each was perfectly cooked and the accompaniments were perfect. The pickled onions on the carnitas taco were delightful. Service was prompt and efficient and they have a good beer selection! This could easily become a new favorite place!"}
{"text":"Had the lunch special, the chicken tortilla soup & garden salad. Unfortunately I thought the soup was horrible & unlike any tortilla soup I've ever had. Salad was fine but I can say the French fries they give you were seriously delicious. For my first visit to this place it didn't make a mark on me so I personally wouldn't do lunch here again. Perhaps breakfast or dinner might be better."}
{"text":"A friend and I had lunch here a recently and we both were impressed with our experience at The Rogue Tomato.  

The interior of the restaurant has a modern and relaxed feeling, with tables and aisles spaced enough apart to not feel cramped.  It also seemed like the staff does a good job of keeping the place up, as everything seemed new and clean.  

The service was outstanding, and while I can't remember our waitresses name she did an amazing job and was very friendly and accommodating.  She even asked if we wanted more tea to go when we were leaving and came back with to go cups for us.  

As for the meal, both of us choose the lunch special, which were a selection of wrap sandwiches with a side salad (there were other options, we both chose the salad though).  I had the chicken Caesar wrap, which was the best wrap sandwich I can remember ever eating.  My friend had one with bacon and avocado, which he said was amazing.  

This was overall one of the best dining experiences I have had in a long time.  We will both be coming here more often in the future."}
{"text":"The west side has been in need of a cool, privately owned restaurant with an awesome bar. Everything on this side of town is a chain, and this restaurant is a breath of fresh air.

The atmosphere is fun and hip, with old movies playing in the background and a chalkboard wall with interesting quotes written on it.

The menu isn't overwhelming, but has a nice variety with differing options for those with dietary restrictions. I've been here several times, and have had  both the meat and black bean burger options (both incredible, btw), and tasted my dining companions' food. EVERYTHING is good. Like, everything. 

Do yourself a favor and try the meatloaf, cuz Asiago mashed potatoes.... You're welcome.

Oh! And that beet juice cocktail. Get that, too! Have fun!"}
{"text":"I have driven past this place several times and wanted to give it a go. I had brunch with my girlfriends here this morning and it was sublime. I had the eggs benedict and they were cooked exactly to my liking. Everyone at this establishment was friendly and the place itself was very clean. Great Sunday brunch atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! They meet and then exceeded all expectations! I have been wanting to come here with my fiancé for some time and we finally went for dinner. The outside of the restaurant has a cool look, all rounded and such. Going in it is big and open with a modern look. They had some Christmas decorations still up. Their menu is simple and straight forward.

Now let's talk about the food because it is amazing! Their presentation is a 10/10 and my dish was so flavorful. I liked the bread too. It had a smokey taste like it was grilled on the barbecue out back. I got to try their fries too and they were on par with everything else.

The service here was outstanding. They were helpful and fun. The food came out with no delay.

Wow, I got to say it again, this place is amazing! Such a great experience here. I encourage everyone to stop by and try it out if you are ever in the area. You will not be disappointed. Keep up the great work Rogue Tomato!"}
{"text":"Great food and what a nice atmosphere.  Dim lighting,  cozy seating and friendly service.  No complaints here."}
{"text":"Rarely do I give a place 5 stars, but we had killer service, GREAT happy hour, and even better tacos for taco Tuesday. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Decided to explore more of Glendale with some friends between classes. The restaurant wasn't very busy and our orders got taken quickly. The staff were all kind and attentive. We got really excited when we saw the glasses our drinks came in. Tall mason jars, which were super cute! Great touch! Our food was delicious and a decent portion size. I got their Bacon Avocado Wrap and my friend got the Turkey sandwich. We had couple bumps with things forgotten in our orders, but their lunch specials were awesome and we had a good time."}
{"text":"My first visit was Happy Hour. I enjoyed the shrimp tacos and cabernet. Second visit was dinner. I had flat steak rare. It was tasty. My daughter had Cajun pasta. Cream sauce was bland and definitely not spicy or cajun. Other daughter has salmon, also tasty.  Overall the food was good, but slightly overpriced. I do like the fact that this is not a chain restaurant in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Stumbled into this place for dinner one night.  What a great find!  Wonderful craft cocktails and a good selection of beers.  The bruschetta and pretzel/chorizo fondue were great appetizers. Have had the St Louis ribs and lemon chicken pasta, both tasted wonderful.  Also have eaten breakfast/brunch here and their Classic Eggs Benedict is as good as any I have ever had. They make the hollandaise sauce every day from scratch.  Have also enjoyed their cheese omelette and their 59th Ave. Burrito. . . filled with eggs, cheese, spicy potatoes, and chorizo.  They also have live music on Saturday night. Great hidden Glendale gem, though kind of hard to find. Located at the South East corner of 59th Ave and Union Hills, next to the Deer Valley Credit Union."}
{"text":"For some odd reason you can't get in on a Friday night without a reservation. I can only chalk it up to us Arrowhead ranchers being so desperate for a local neighborhood restaurant. After eating here, you'd have to be desperate. 

The drink menu says \"we're trying really, really hard to have trendy drinks, but we're failing miserably.\" Every drink has ingredients you have to google because the server doesn't know what they are. Turns out that chartreuse is an artichoke  liqueur. No thank you. Even the sparkling lemonade and cucumbers couldn't make the drink seem appetizing. I ordered the \"sucker punch\" - another concoction of 7 or more unusual combinations of ingredients. You'd have to be a sucker to order and drain this $11 drink. It tastes like old black licorice.

The entrees were expensive: $29 for an 18-oz ribeye. Eighteen ounces? Who eats a steak large enough to feed a family of 4,  except for a family of 4? Lost my appetite. So I ordered the blue crab cakes and the caesar wedge salad. The crab cakes were like wet mush and were absolutely flavorless. The Caesar wedge was ok, but it's $9 worth of stems of romaine, 2 croutons and a dime-sized dollop of dressing. Equally as unspectacular as the crab mush.

Btw, my companion requested the house Chardonnay. It was tasty and she had 2 glasses. When the bill came, the \"house\" Chardonnay was $9 a glass, and a chintzy pour at that. We questioned our server as to why the house wine is as expensive as a high end glass of wine. Her response- we don't actually have a \"house\" wine, just a wine list with 4 selections. Well then missy, I suggest you tell the next customer who requests the \"house\" wine that one such wine does not exist.

My final evaluation- D minus. Too expensive, tries too hard to be unique and trendy, food is forgettable. Our $71 check plus tip did not reflect $71 worth of dining."}
{"text":"We started with the Pretzel And Chorizo Fondue, and the pretzels tasted like the frozen kind from Costco, but the cheese was OK. The carnitas tacos were greasy and unpleasant, and my wife's \"prime rib\" sliders were bland and the meat did not taste like \"slow cooked prime rib.\" It tasted like Safeway lunch meat. 

I'm going to be frank and possibly a bit mean here, because the reviews of this place seem to be glowing and frankly I don't get it. This restaurant looks nice inside, but the execution on the food tastes like someone ate at a nice place, and thought \"I can make stuff like this!\" But they can't. It just tasted bad. I felt like I was watching an episode of kitchen nightmares. Nothing tasted fresh. I was really hoping we were getting a new local offering on the west side that we could frequent, but this isn't it. Someone else should try, because clearly people are hungry for one, but I personally don't think this place does the trick. Nothing tasted fresh, which is not what you expect from a small somewhat focused menu and a place that bills itself as casual fine dining.

I'd like to try again, since clearly some others have enjoyed their experience, but ours was so bad I can't justify it."}
{"text":"My first visit for lunch and it was delicious! It's a really nice space and the menu looks really good. 
Crab cakes are yummy and they have mango iced tea, unsweetened! 

I had the Spinach, Kale & Quinoa salad and had them add chicken to it. Very tasty. 

Service was very slow, they are new so I'm sure they will work it out. I will be back to try more items."}
{"text":"Love eating here for breakfast, tried it for dinner... it was decent, not great. Margaritas were good but small and mostly filled with ice, definitely not worth the price."}
{"text":"Breakfast was great.  Restaurant is clean and staff was friendly and attentive, but not annoying."}
{"text":"Disappointing dinner.  All of our dishes were very mediocre to say the least.  The salmon was over cooked and covered in a sauce that wasn't very tasty.  I had the Pecan roasted chicken and it was bland and not flavorful at all.  The waiters favorite food was the burger and ribs and maybe we should have gone with that.  Normally we are not disappointed by Yelp reviews but this was an exception.  Definitely won't be back.  Service was slow too."}
{"text":"Every time I've come the food has been excellent. The service has been hit or miss but usually friendly nonetheless. (Friendly but not outgoing if that makes sense) Breakfast and dinner were both great."}
{"text":"Came here to try a new place and saw it had good reviews. Unfortunately don't need to come back. Got the pretzels with cheese and pretty sure the pretzels were frozen Super Pretzels. Which I could have just bought at the grocery store. So disappointing. Also had the three meat flatbread. Wasn't really a flatbread. Just a regular pizza that was just ok. Decor and service were great but that's about it."}
{"text":"Loved our waitress! Everyone was friendly and great service. The food was so good and the prices decent. We got the Rogue burger, red pepper soup, chicken pesto flatbread, and the green chili dishes. No complaints about any of them. I think the only reason we didn't give it a five star is we felt like the menu was a little limited."}
{"text":"I really want this please to make it.  Have been there twice and the second time was better than the first.  Give them a try."}
{"text":"Awesome brunch! I ordered the delicious Munster and cheddar cheese omelet with fresh spinach and roasted portobello mushrooms. It came with yummy rosemary potatoes and toast with fresh-made berry jam. We also got delicious sausages and fluffy pancakes too! Super tasty and fresh- this place is really cute inside and has great service! We will definitely be back! The coffee was nice and strong so I was a happy camper!!!"}
{"text":"Rogue Tomato fits the bill when it comes to what we were all looking for here in Glendale. Something new and modern. A Place with craft beers, fun yet different menu, cute inside and out. Rogue Tomato has finally brought that to us. All they are missing are the Craft Cocktails. But I have a feeling that might be coming. ( Update: CRAFT COCKTAILS IN THE HOUSE!! :) )

I loved my first impression. Even as you walk up to the door, you are greeted by 2 giant round, Metal, \"Rogue Tomoato\" signs on each door. On the inside they have dark décor; Dark wood, and brick line the walls and floor. There is a Floor to ceiling, and almost Wall to Wall Chalk Board that lines the back of the room with beers, specials, desserts, and all kinds of quotes and goodies on it. Parts of the ceiling are lined with that beautiful bronze, metal, regal, cathedral looking tile. There is a Bar towards the back with high-top backed chairs. High Top Tables and Chairs also around the bar. There are booths, and table seating through the restaurant. There's also a nice cozy corner with some sofa's and a table. A small side, dog-friendly patio with seating outside. Its a very beautiful establishment.

I came here for lunch with my husband and some friends. We started with the Pretzel And Chorizo Fondue:House muenster cheese fondue topped with chorizo and served with warm, soft pretzels. The pretzels could be little softer but not bad. There was plenty to share. Then I got the Southwestern Chicken Panini: Grilled chicken, bacon, roasted jalapeno corn relish, chipotle mayo, pepperjack cheese, and crisp romaine on artisan white bread served with fries. That Jalapeno Corn Relish was so flavorful. All the flavors came together really nicely. The fries were crispy and seasoned well. There were  6 of us. Everyone got something different from the lunch menu and not one complaint. We all cant wait to go back. I am looking forward to trying the Pumpkin Pie. YUM! 

Chef Devin came out and greeted us with his Wife Genna. They were both so pleasant and full of information. They said they were looking to fill the niche here in Glendale and to give us great quality food. They said they were going to play a little bit with the menu. Get rid of some things that don't work and more things that they think will fit better. They are very number oriented. It seems that they are looking forward to having more and more business. They were welcome to suggestions and input. I think they know what they are doing. I hope they keep the ball rolling. 

Thank you again to Devin, Genna, and our most adorable, fun, and funny waitress. I did not catch her name. She was a peach though. Long dark, hair, dark eye's and a great sense of humor. We will be back to visit you and your great food and drink soon."}
{"text":"Love this place. My husband and I have only been here for breakfast. Hubby loves the frittata and I have basically had a taste of everything...all great. Especially like the breakfast potatoes. Even the bread is special. Pure quality food. Also love the Bloody Mary, it's spicy and flavorful with the perfect amount of alcohol. All the servers are wonderful and friendly. Good way to start the day. Can't wait to stop in for dinner."}
{"text":"Second time here for breakfast and was impressed again!  This time was the Huevos Rancheros.  Deee-lish!!  Gonna have to come back for dinner, drinks & some live local music."}
{"text":"We have now been to The Rogue Tomato twice. Both times for dinner however I'm curious to see their lunch menu... The first visit we had the crab cakes, the pecan crusted chicken and the flatiron steak. All were fantastic!  The second visit, we went as a family. Again we had the crab cakes (yum!) Then we ordered the veggie burger, the steak, the salmon and the halibut. There was not a single morsel left on anyone's plate. Stuffed as we were, we ordered dessert. The carrot cake, the flourless chocolate cake and the cheesecake. I don't think I could choose a favorite. 

What I like most about this restaurant is the ambiance. Good music, set to the right level so you can still have a conversation. Clean décor that appears to me a mix of contemporary and traditional. This restaurant, by far, is our new favorite place!"}
{"text":"Found this lovely place on Yelp and so glad me and my boyfriend went! The ambience was so rad inside and looked so cute ! The servers were attentive and the sweetest and the food was to die for! Their salmon was amazing ! I got the salmon sliders and they were perfect! I actually can not wait to be back! See you guys soon !"}
{"text":"We drove half an hour to get here for brunch. Heard great reviews. I had the pork belly Benedict's, could have used a bit more pork belly. The home potatoes were cooked and seasoned perfectly. My hubby had the huevos centenos with the potatoes and we both thought they were very good. I would have given this place 5 stars but the server took quite a while with drinks. We had to ask 3 times for lemons for the water and the mimosas were soooo full of oj, I could've just had plain juice. Tasted nothing like it may have champagne. But over all food was good and the atmosphere is very chill. I think they need a better bartender, after all, coming out for brunch is all about Drinks and we only had one mimosa. Not worth ordering it. But we'll come back during the week and check it out again."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. Slow service. Over cooked and undercooked food at the same time. Minimum selection. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast after seeing great reviews on Yelp. It's not a terrible place, if I lived closer I may have given it another chance. The dark decor and lighting made me feel like I was walking in at 7:30pm, great for a romantic evening I suppose. We chose to sit outside to get a little more light on our breakfast. We wanted mimosas. They were out of champagne...major tears. Service was lovely but the food was so greasy I had to ask for some napkins to try to soak it up off my eggs and potatoes. I tried to like it, I did. Feeling like I just ate fast food. :("}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants on that side of the town. Good food, great decor and wonderful waiting staff."}
{"text":"I've just had The Rogue Burger. It.may be the best burger I've ever had: a big, prime beef patty seared on a flat top so hot it gives the crust a bit of a crunch. Other excellent ingredients are served in a perfect, slim ciabatta roll. Even the matchstick fries are wonderful."}
{"text":"Love this little place.  Have been there many time for Happy Hour and appetizers.  They make an awesome Blood Orange Mojito that's on their Happy Hour menu.  We haven't had lunch or dinner there yet but will and will respond after.  I like the atmosphere and how it's decorated.  It's kinda nice to get away from the national chains and this place is neat."}
{"text":"Haaaay... 

So, Hi. 

And I'm not gunna pick on you, guy. You guys do a lot of good things. 

We--my different minds & I--like you. And we really wanna like you guys more, cos you're close, affordable, and you're not a fad, or trying to be a trend. Can't stand restaurants trying to be what they're not. 

But I just can't give you 5 stars. At least not today. Ok?

Taco's are everywhere in AZ. And yours were promising where I was almost overlooking the lack of seasoning in the Carnitas itself. And it had browning in it but as advertised (Crispy) it was thoroughly not. Stewed? I'm mean it didn't taste boiled, but it was almost, soggy-boggy, wet?

Marinated onions on the tacos (Visually appealing) were just kinda meh. I would suggest using rice wine or apple cider vinegar. And maybe a pinch of pickling spice. 

Ok, now that that's over, now we can be friends again. 

we loved your Cuban sandwich. I'm not gunna say I bit into it and my eyes rolled back and I could see the Florida beach and feel the sand between my toes or smell the cocaine beneath my nose, but I did get some horripilation outta that, yeah. 

And the drinks... From the mid-morning alcoholics, to you Rogue Tomato, we Salute you!

So 2nd time back, and we're looking forwards to a 3rd."}
{"text":"So amazing! I can't recommend this place enough! Locally owned and operated. The owner is a chef, so there is a lot of pride in the food that comes out. Awesome happy hour specials with a decent beer list. Had pretzels and muenster cheese dip with chorizo for an appetizer, delicious. The rogue burger was one of the best cheeseburgers I've ever had. Skip a chain restaurant for dinner and check this place out instead. You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant out for Mother's Day. The decor is really nice and modern looking. It seems a bit overpriced. Had the veggie burger. It was okay. The fries it came with were overcooked and stale.  I didn't get the opportunity to mention it to the server as she didn't come back to the table, and I really wanted to eat them so that was disappointing. Our server was very friendly, but left us waiting way too long to clear our plates and drop off the bill. It was too quiet and empty which made for an awkward atmosphere. Not a very good experience for us, but I hope this place works out. It's nice to have a modern restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"We've gone twice now - once for dinner and today again for lunch. We had guacamole, pretzel with cheddar dip and quesadillas. The serving size of all three were massive and appropriate for a party of four or so. Both the guacamole and pretzel w/ cheddar dip were absolutely amazing and I could eat those everyday for the rest of my life. I didn't personally care for the quesadillas due to the amount of veggies in them, but my friend thought they were great. We came during happy hour so we got quite a bit off our bill. Service was efficient and friendly. The place is all brand new and quite nice inside. I'm glad there's a nice place like this in the area and I'll be returning. 

As we were drowning ourselves in guac and cheese we both had the same thought - We would love to see elote on the menu!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately not so great second time around. Do not order the Bloody Mary! It was awful. I came with family for breakfast and was sorely disappointed. Our food was cold, which I didn't understand especially when they were half empty. Service was mediocre at best. Sad that they couldn't keep the ball rolling."}
{"text":"Finally great foodie spot in the Northwest Valley! @theroguetomatoeatery has such a cute, rustic atmosphere - very clean and a nice open space. Service was great, awesome recommendations and very attentive staff. I had Chilequiles with poached eggs and green chili - mmmmmmm - little spice, super savory! Coffee was great too! They even offered a specialized boozy baileys coffee for brunch."}
{"text":"There are pretty slim pickings in Glendale and given that The Rogue Tomato is pretty good given what we have here. 

My friend and I split the artichoke dip and he had the tacos while I had the skirt steak. The artichoke dip was a little runny with a little less flavor/cheese to it than I would like. In terms of artichoke dip my bar is California Pizza Kitchen's dip. My steak was pretty good. The fries were seasoned which is always a huge plus and the chimichurri sauce that came as a condiment was a great touch. I thought it was a bit peculiar to also have a piece of pita bread beneath the steak smothered in chimichurri though. I would've preferring the chimichurri to be above the steak and not making the pita (which itself was sort of a strange accompaniment) all soggy. The real highlights though were my friend's Mahi Mahi tacos. A nice piece of fish in a great soft taco with generous toppings. I've been trying to find time go back just to get in on their taco Tuesday deal."}
{"text":"Had an awesome morning breakfast in the middle of the week.  I ended up having to take a fitness test on the west end of the valley and was in search of a great breakfast place in Glendale.  I found it here in the Rogue Tomato, being off set from the street may have something to do with the lack of a crowd, but I found it just pleasant for myself.

I sat at the bar, ordered up my usual which seems to be 2 eggs and 2 eggs and sausage right now.  My waitress kept my coffee full and my water right when I needed it.  The jam was awesome as well as the salsa.  Awesome and fast, no complaints to be had. Can't say I'll drive on a Saturday morning for brunch but when you waitress keeps a good conversation it's sure to be a good morning and day."}
{"text":"Stopped by because we were in the area.  It was fine but forgettable.  I would call it a \"safe\" choice but not a destination."}
{"text":"Our waitress looks drunk ..took 15 minutes to get a cup of coffee..and then when I did get coffee ..she ran out while pouring ..did she come back to fill up my cup..Nooooo, not to be completely negative she was friendly enough. So when I did get my coffee I didn't get a spoon..I don't know the coffee rules but I don't think stirring coffee with the butt end of the knife is one of them. With all that being said the food was great..its obvious that the owners are on top of the back of the house operations. But the front needs some work. I just hope they"}
{"text":"Came in with some coworkers for lunch one afternoon and was pleased with how accommodating they were for our party of 12. The menu had a wide variety of choices and their service was very quick. I was happy to see the high quality of ingredients used in their meals."}
{"text":"Very good.  I highly recommend checking this place out.  Very nice decor and the food was delicious.  They have a pick 2 for lunch.  I had roasted pepper soup and the caprese salad and all come with the shoestring fries.  The soup was okay, but the salad dressing (Cabernet vinegarette) was amazing and make sure to try the fry sauce."}
{"text":"Oh boy!!! I don't know how we missed this place!! It's been open since February 2016,  no excuses!! Upon entering this trendy place, the decor sets the tone.. subdued,  chalkboard walls, mixed with brick and wood, and industrial piping. Gorgeous!! 
Hubby ordered the Bloody Mary.  Now, I have to say, I am very pickey about Bloody Marys and this one rose to the occasion!! Now this one is #1 on my list!!
I ordered the Huevos Y Centeno, substituted bacon for the corned beef. What a taste sensation!! The Swiss Cheese sauce was soooooo yummy, the eggs poached to perfection, and that chilli rye bread is to die for!!
Hubby ordered the Classic Cheese Omelet, without add-ons. He has to try items \"as they come \" first,  then he ventures forth with add ons.  His portion was generous and he loved it.
We both had the Rosemary infused potatoes and boy,  they were delicious!!
We asked for the lunch menu, thought about just staying till then,  we are so impressed with this place!! 
As I am writing this, hubby reads the lunch entrees and I am salivating - they all sound soooo yummy, it is gonna be hard to choose!! He keeps chanting \"Caesar Wedge, why has nobody done that before?\" That will be the first he tries, I reckon!!
Ya owe it to yourself to try this place!!"}
{"text":"I am out of the loop, because I have never heard of this place - but found it on Yelp when looking for a Brunch Spot in the Northwest Valley. Two Words: Yum and Wow. 

The brunch menu is extensive, the drink specials (prickly pear mule for $5.00) were bangin', and the server Suzanne was super sweet and attentive. I think I found my new favorite brunch spot in the area. There was no crazy long wait, the food was SO GOOD.  Usually choices in the area are IHOP or Dennys for breakfast/brunch in the area, I am SO excited to have found Rogue Tomato!"}
{"text":"Walking out the door the resonating reflection is..man I forgot how expensive food is in Phoenix. 

Okay, so rogue is not a bad spot. It's really pretty cool inside. And our server was the sweetest whippersnapper ever who kept up with our every request. But breakfast here was overall just fine. The lemon ricotta pancakes were not noteworthy. Neither was the coffee or the frittata. If anything, the frittata was rather greasy. The bacon was good. But sheesh I walked out the door with a 15+ bill for breakfast. 

I bet lunch and dinner are much better. Over the years, this location has taken shape as different restaurants. Let's see what sticks."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and ordered completely different items each time. Every single thing was amazing! The drinks are so yummy and unique and the food is delicious! The atmosphere is clean and cozy. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It's a hit and miss with these guys I've been to this restaurant twice now. My husband and I ordered the pretzel and chorizo fondue it was really good the first time had a lot of flavor and spice the second time was okay. Their burgers, fish tacos, and shrimp taco's are good though. I would go back every Tuesday just for the taco's alone and it's at a great price."}
{"text":"And once again they did not disappoint! The French toast melted in my mouth. So good."}
{"text":"Wonderful service, overall nice place to eat with good options.

I would recommend the brioche French toast!"}
{"text":"My wife and i have eaten here a couple of times and they never fail to deliver. Their fish tacos are exceptional, the atmosphere different than most places on the west side. Support this great place in the north west valley."}
{"text":"Thought we would come back and give this little local restaurant a try for breakfast...  Waited for over 5 minutes...not busy... never got acknowledged... No coffee...no water... No one came by to say they would be with us shortly. We were very disappointed... We got up to leave and a server behind the counter said... Have a nice day! I replied we didn't even get breakfast! But no one said anything as we started for the door... They just watched us walk towards the door.  We left to find another breakfast place with service!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is cool. Good selection of alcoholic beverages and micro brew beers. I had the Cajun Shrimp Alfredo which was really good. My wife had the Pecan Crusted Chicken which she said was good as well. I gave four stars because it was a little on the expensive side but i will definitely be returning in the future."}
{"text":"This place absolutely deserves 5 stars! The appetizer and the entrée were delicious,  the service was friendly, and the dessert ( lemon mascarpone cheesecake )  was superb.  Well done..my wife and I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Clean restaurant, food is very good & has an upscale feel to it but I wish they had more standard breakfast items, not all fancy foods. It's also strange that you have to ask for every little thing instead of them just keeping it on the tables (salt, ketchup, etc). The wait to get your food can sometimes take a while also but again, the food is quite good."}
{"text":"Amazing!  My wife and I stopped in for breakfast after a hike at Thunderbird park.  The place is beautiful. Atmosphere, food, service... exceptional!  I had the Frittata with rosemary potatoes, and toast w/ rhubarb jam.  Coffee delicious.  Glendale has been waiting and wanting more options for unique, relaxed, fine casual dining experience that doesn't feel like a chain restaurant.  Highly recommend to all!"}
{"text":"Wow! Ate here for the first time today. They officially open the 11th of February. Everything on the menu sounds delicious and, from what we ordered, tastes delicious. It is a more upscale American bistro with some clever flavor twists inspired by the Southwest. I had the grilled salmon which was amazing! We also ordered crab cakes and spinach artichoke as appetizers. The crab cakes were perfect and came with such a good sauce. The spinach artichoke was probably the best artichoke dip I have ever had! For dessert our favorite was the carrot cake. This place is so well decorated inside and the decor is complimented by the very classy staff who treated us very well. This place is a must!"}
{"text":"My family and I just ate dinner at \" The Rouge Tomato\"the service was great.  The food was just ok but the prices are really high.  We ordered one kids meal 2 adult meals and one salid . We drank water that's it . Our bill was $70.00 . We left w no left overs .  Sad to say for that price  most likely won't go back there again ."}
{"text":"First off, if you order the red bell pepper soup don't order the cup, order the bowl! It is so good, I kid you not! You'll regret it if you don't. I also tried the caprese salad with chicken and it was good, but I did feel the plate was too small for the salad. This made it possible for some green leaves to fall off the sides of my plate. I also tried the torte, which was so tasty. When there waitress bright it I could smell the raspberry coulis too! The staff was super friendly and made great conversation. This place is a gem and a great bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time for breakfast.  I like what they did with the decor...very rustic trendy.   A decent breakfast menu but limited on gluten free options.  I had the cheese omelet with sausage and potatoes.  Neither were very large in portion.    A scant helping of potatoes which did have good flavor.  The omelet was average tasting.  Coffee was good and that is important to me. Would like to try out their happy hour and see what they have to offer."}
{"text":"Me and one of my girl friends were looking for a decent brunch place on the West side. Saw this place on Yelp, and decided to give it a go.
We started off with the Pretzel and Chorizo Fondue.   And a Mimosa a piece as well. It's not Brunch without an adult bevy or two. The Fondue was so good. The Pretzels for dipping were gone in no time. And, we mutually decided to keep what was left of the Cheese from the Fondue for our entrees as well. My friend got their Salmon Sliders they came with Shoestring French fries and looked very appetizing. I chose the Mahi Mahi tacos which came with rice and were very tasty as well. The mimosas were so thirst quenching we both had a second one each for dessert at the end. Our waitress was very friendly, and engaging. The rest of the staff were quite hospitable as well. When I looked around the restaurant before we were about to leave I noticed the other tables that arrived at the same time as us still there. We were there a couple hours catching up on life. The restaurant itself is nicely decorated comfortably lit, but not too bright for a longer stay. Overall for the price, quality, and service it was well worth a try. And I will definitely be going back again for more. Nice to know there is a close, delicious brunch place."}
{"text":"This was our first time.  Our son and daughter-in-law were visiting and we decided to come here.  It is FANTASTIC!!  Loved everything from the greeting at the door to the awesome waitress and the food was wonderful.  Can't wait to come back.  Thanks for a great experience!!"}
{"text":"Always happy to see a new local place in the neighborhood!

This is a solid four-star restaurant, based on my first visit, which was a take-out order.  Will definitely come back and see if dining in pushes The Rogue Tomato up to 5 stars. The dining room is very cute and looks like it would make a great date spot. The bar also looks like a cool place to grab a drink. However, the hostess seemed a bit overwhelmed and flustered handling more than one guest at a time. 

We ordered two Rogue Burgers to go. I was very impressed with how well the french fries held up even to go. When we got home they were still nice and crispy, without being greasy. They have a really great flavor too. 

The burger itself was pretty tasty - a nice thick piece of beef that was cooked exactly as ordered. The bun was sort of unremarkable. Not bad, just nothing special. The aoli sauce was SO tasty with just a hint of heat. It was just very sparse and I'd have liked a bit more of it. 

What would have made this 5-stars would have been:
-a toasty bun
-a little bit more generous toppings 
-staff being a little bit better prepared to handle guests

Will definitely be back to try dining in!"}
{"text":"We visited with our family and left very impressed! As an appetizer we had the chorizo & cheese fondue. It was melted cheese with a a good portion of chorizo on top and pretzel type bread. It was delicious! We had a few kids meals. My kid loved the pizza and the other had a burger. They were happy. I had the adult cheeseburger. Delicious does not describe it!!! It was cooked perfect and was amazing! I highly recommend the burger. We also had the salmon and the shrimp alfredo. My family members were very impressed and satisfied. THEN, comes dessert!! We had the crime brûlée with fruit compote, carrot cake and lemon cheesecake. We highly recommend all three. My favorite was the creme brûlée!! But I ate all three as leftovers and was content throughout the week!! We highly recommend the restaurant. The atmosphere is very pleasing to the eye and comfortable. The staff was very accommodating and friendly. Go try this place!"}
{"text":"I would have given 4 stars if not for the adulterated \"pure\" maple syrup that was so obviously pancake syrup made with high fructose corn syrup. I have noticed a trend in restaurants trying to save money by advertising syrup as \"real\" or \"pure\" or even \"maple syrup\"- the truth is they either sell straight up Aunt Jemima, or blend the corn syrup concoction with pure maple syrup whilst still claiming it to be pure.

Secondly, the Bloody Mary: I could tell by the smell I was going to be disappointed. I tried to find some way to enjoy it, but I could not. The balance was way off. The presentation was sloppy. It just was not good. Too many mystery chunks getting caught in my straw. An off fishy smell was incredibly off putting. Bloody Mary's are usually refreshing- not this one. 

However- the brunch food I ordered was delicious! 

The coffee was also very good considering you never expect much out of restaurant coffee. I do believe prices could be better when substituting egg whites, though. The French toast, while still delicious, was likely not soaked long enough, as it was incredibly dry.

I will return for a dinner menu visit. Hopefully all will be delicious as the many positive reviews suggest! This place seems promising, so perhaps we sat in on a Saturday brunch at an off time.

Will update my review with next visit."}
{"text":"Not very happy with our lunch experience on 03/16/16 we got seated right away but took a while to get waited on.  There was some confusion guess they thought our order was taken already.  I order the BBQ sliders WITH OUT the onion things well it came out with them on it. I told her I ordered it without Onion and she said I didn't here you tell me that if you did. I hate Onion.  We were in a big hurry so I just picked them off because I know that all they would have done in the back.  It was only okay because in the back of my mind I new there were onions on it fried or not I hate Onion  my GF hot the prime rib sliders it was very tuff and fatty she did not eat but 1/2.  No one came back to check on us even.  We had to ask someone else for refills X2.  When she did come back with the check and saw my GF didn't eat much she first said those are so good you get fill already.  We told her how it was showed her the fat and all she said was do you want a box.  Lol no its not eat able.  Oh okay is there anything else you guys want desert.  After telling her no gave our check.  No sorry or let me get the manager.  She seemed very new scarred and unsure of her self. Was hoping this was going to be a lot better because I wanted to do my parents anniversary here. I really hope things get better and this was a off day.  I wish you guys the best of luck and welcome you to Glendale. God bless"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! I've been to brunch 3 times, and dinner once. I've never been let down by the food. The servers are stretched a little thin - all four times that I've been there it was the same. The server was taking care of too many people to take GOOD care of them, so service is slow, drinks are slow to come out, etc. That being said, the food is worth the wait. Beef stroganoff? Holy crap it was so good. The brunch is amazing - I've had the 59th Ave burrito and the chilaquiles. Both were out of this world. So, when you go, expect amazing food with slow service, and you'll be happy."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time this morning for Mother's Day Brunch. OMG so good. The staff is friendly and attentive and the prices are reasonable. I got the Mediterranean Eggs Benedict and basically licked the plate clean + mimosa!  My Husband got the Chilaquiles.. Very flavorful! and the bloody mary he got was tasty too. nice and spicy; not too much of anything. We'll for sure be back."}
{"text":"I'm so glad my wife and I went random Yelping today for dinner. The Rogue Tomato is a welcome addition to the usual chain-resturant options on the west side. We both enjoyed the Kale Quinoa salad which featured pineapple and fresh bacon pieces. So good it eclipsed my previously favorite Kale-Quinoa salad from Le Grande Orange, in Phoenix. Fabulous is a word I don't use often when describing food. The vegetable lasagna was easily fabulous. Such a delicious slice of heaven covered in flavorful marinara! Wow! So great! A side of grilled asparagus and blue corn crab cakes are the other items I tried -- stole from my wife's plate:) Again, everything was fab. The Chef and his wife prowl about making sure their guests are happy. I was. My lovely date (wifey) appreciated the stylish atmosphere. Thank you people for bringing something interesting, creative, and extremely pleasing to our side of town. 

Finally, this is not an inexpensive resturant. You will find that you will most definitely get your money's worth here. Quality ain't cheap. Time for us west side rednecks to step up and support an excellent family business. The Macaroni Grill doesn't really love you.

Note: Comments mentioning the slow service are typical for new restaurants. It takes several months to sort out staffing and culture issues. Don't let the bad service reviews keep you from enjoying this culinary labor of love."}
{"text":"I have been here at least a half a dozen times for either lunch or dinner. The menu is on the small side but a great verity. Haven't had a dish that I didn't like. Give it a  try!"}
{"text":"Great spot with quality food and cocktails. 

Came in for lunch and this place had a really nice atmosphere, fun decor with cute quotes all over the walls. For drinks we went with the cucumber mule and the blood orange mojito. The mule was aaaaamazing - crisp and light and incredibly refreshing. The cucumber made it 11/10. The blood orange mojito was super tasty and very very sweet. 

We had the pretzel with chorizo fondue and the rogue burger. Absolutely must order the lemon aioli on the side with the fries, this stuff is bomb! The pretzel was super good and the fondue with chorizo on top was good but not the most flavorful cheese I've ever had. 

I'd definitely want to come back in here and try some more menu items, they had a lot of great looking options! 

Have to say though that I saw the butternut squash soup pic here on yelp and was pretty bummed to see that they didn't have it on the menu"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere, freakin delicious brunch, reasonable prices for the quality of food, and great customer service. Love love love the cave creek coffee!"}
{"text":"Food, Service, Atmosphere all very good! The pretzels are to die for!!!

Happy Hour? Beer prices? $$$$. Sorry Way too expensive! Would be a GREAT place to frequent for H.H. but too many cheaper options guys..."}
{"text":"Our waitress was so nice and friendly! She continuously checked on our table and refilled our drinks. The mahi mahi tacos were lightly fried, and came with a creamy avocado sauce and a flavorful side of rice. They were served on a fresh flour tortilla. They were so good!! Some of the best I've ever had. I definitely recommend this place. The reviews are true"}
{"text":"It's ok. The service was good, they were friendly. It has kind of a hipster look and feel to the place if you're into that. The breakfast menu is kind of lacking, probably more of a lunch place I suppose. The reason I'm giving a three star review is because of the price. It was very expensive for the portions they give. Pancakes are $10, and that's with no sides at all. Come on, that's insane for pancakes and no sides.. I can get endless pancakes for cheaper than that. The huevos rancheros had a tiny amount chorizo as a garnish scattered on the side, might as well not even have it in there at all. Felt like I was eating in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"The paper thin corned beef on the ruben sandwich gets very high marks from us. The caprese salad was also very nice. Finished by sharing the pistachio carrot cake. Mmmm. This was our first time in and we highly recommend spending time at the Rogue Tomato."}
{"text":"AMAZING LOCAL SPOT!  It is nice to see the West Side stepping it up with the Chef Owned and Inspired restaurant.  COME HERE!  

The atmosphere is great and the service was top notch.  Food was a whole other realm of flavor.

I want to come back for breakfast."}
{"text":"Great food, good service, and a WONDERFUL atmosphere. Stopped here for a delicious brunch and enjoyed mellow, beautiful live music while we ate. The design aesthetic of the interior alone would have been enough to make us come back. Add on the service and food and it's one of the hidden gems of Glendale!"}
{"text":"I am happy to update my review and I can now be a fan of this restaurant because on my latest experience the food was great tasting and technically very improved.

The Rogue Tomato is a fun new restaurant that recently opened in Glendale. The menu is mostly American with some Mexi American offerings.

This time we came for lunch on the comfortable umbrella covered patio that is also dog friendly. We came with our dogs and the kind server gave the dogs water right away.

I had the salmon sliders. They were very tasty and sort of fancy and different with a delicious lemon aioli and other toppings like cucumber and arugula. The fish was flaky and moist and even the bun was carefully toasted and seem buttered. My platter came with fresh hot crisp fries that were detailed with tasty seasoning. I also received ketchup and a fry sauce for dipping. 

My husband had the Rogue Burger. He said the burger patty was a good tasting beef and he liked the crispy onions and everything else that came with it. It did come out a little more done than he likes but other than that everything was terrific about that plate.

Our server was really great!

You might want to check this place out when your in the neighborhood!

NO LONGER DOG FRIENDLY"}
{"text":"Great Food! We had the mahi mahi tacos and the pretzels. The mahi mahi tacos were delicious with the right amount of flavors which made it amazing will for sure get those again. Then the Pretzels with Chorizo Fondue was just outstanding. Then great tea to top the experience. I will be coming here again for sure!!"}
{"text":"I will preface by saying I'm not a fan of strip mall restaurants so please don't be upset if your experience at RT was better than mine. I ordered a salad to start, a bottle of beer, and then some tacos with a side of rice. Not worth my time or money."}
{"text":"OMG. Place is awesome. North side needs a place as good as this.  I had the beef stroganoff and it was so delicious.  The night we were here they had a free wine tasting.  Love this place. Check it out."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast on a Sunday. It wasn't busy and we were seated right away. The waitress was nice but said it was her first breakfast shift so she didn't know anything about the menu really. We ordered the veggie frittata and the two egg breakfast. Everything was very very well cooked. The eggs were perfectly shiny and not crusty at all. The Rosemary potatoes were my favorite thing- really soft inside and crispy outside and flavorful. The sausage was really good. My fiancé said his frittata was bland but I didn't try it. Breakfast was kind of expensive but good. For the two meals plus coffee it was about $35."}
{"text":"Great food and happy hour.  The artist singing for the brunch has an amazing voice.  Joe our waiter is not only funny, but quick witted like me.  A little bummer that there is no appetizers, but maybe my fat butt doesn't need any."}
{"text":"Came in here late Saturday night. The decor is awesome, service is good (server was Stacey - he was great). The food?? Amazing! We ordered calamari for an appetizer. I was shocked at how good it was! The breading, obviously homemade, was one of the greatest things I've ever tasted. I would come back here JUST for the calamari! 
I ordered the rogue burger which was great. It had a little kick of spice. The shoe fries that came with it were cooked perfectly. Just crunchy enough. 
My only complaint was the Pom-tini. It was overall just a bad cocktail, all I tasted was vodka and it was supposed to have pomegranate seeds in it but.... alas, no seeds. 

I don't live in the area anymore so I'll only be back here on occasion but I'm definitely recommending this place to my friends in the Glendale area!"}
{"text":"Awful! I took my lunch break at a new place was excited to try and came out so disappointed. Ordered 2 bowls of soup to go after waiting about 10 minutes before anyone would help me. I was handled a bag of 4 take out bowls of soup and told they didn't have the large bowls in stock and I literally had to ask for the accompanying tortillas and another spoon for my co-workers soup. Mind you I paid $14 for 2 bowls of soup! And the soup has almost zero meat in it. Who puts crunchy Tortola strips in a take out soup?!?! Awful. Our office will not be running here for lunch."}
{"text":"It was our first time at Rogue! We stumbled upon it after attempting another destination for breakfast. The atmosphere is pleasant but a bit dark unless you're by the window. The meal was nice but the little things were missing. Coffee pitchers for refills, warmed syrup for pancakes(no butter on the pancakes) and offering of condiments. We enjoyed the meal but we have other destinations for breakfast that are more pleasurable with more attention to the details that take a place from Good to Great!!"}
{"text":"Went here with my husband and friend a few months ago. I was a little skeptical but blown away by the food and service. We happened to go on a night where they lost all connection to their POS system and couldn't ring us out so our meals were free (we paid with whatever cash we had anyways). Everyone handled it with such grace and we were excited to go back. 

We ended up making another trip a few weeks ago and were very disappointed. Our needs weren't met by the staff. The whole experience was just very awkward. No one seemed to know who was taking care of us, where to put us, when to check on us. It was very strange. Our food came barely cooked. It was not what we expected, at all. 

We will likely give them another shot. They have great happy hour deals and we are holding onto hope that we will be blown away, again!"}
{"text":"Finally a chef inspired modern restaurant on the Upper Westside! Love this place. 
Every person I bring loves it!"}
{"text":"The drinks are good here & we had the calamari for an appetizer it was good. We came here after being disappointed at another place for the beers being flat & taps not clean & we're very happy with the beers we had here. Small place off the road a bit my concern is they have not been open very long & it's not very busy we were there on a Saturday around 4-5pm. If you don't want to deal with the crowds this is the spot for you."}
{"text":"This place is so nice. The ambiance and live music. Haven't ate here yet but are planning to this weekend.  We just stopped in for a cocktail."}
{"text":"Grilled asparagus? How special/great could it be? Hubby wanted so we ordered. Wow! Amazingly good! We could have licked the platter it was so beautifully served on because yes, it is that good! As were the crab cakes, pretzel fondue, and calamari... and the pistachio ginger carrot cake!  Go--you won't be disappointed! Best new restaurant in the area since Arrowhead Grill. Ask to be seated in Austin's section, he was a wonderful waiter. Hope this place is around for a long time!"}
{"text":"A new favorite go to place for dinner. You will not regret the rogue burger... Amazing! The shrimp alfredo is also a delicious choice, and save room for some carrot cake:) The chorizo fondue is a personal favorite. Great new place in Glendale, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Brought my wife here for a dinner without the kiddos and we were both really impressed.  The decore is modern bistro and to pur surprise there was a spanish guitar player providing wonderfully soothing tunes.  We started with the bruscheta and shared a cesar wedge.  I told our waitress we were going to share the salad and she brought it out on two plates without asking. Our entrees were the bbq pork flatbread and the garlic crusted flat iron steak.  The flatbread was excellent, the pork tender and the bbq sauce was thick and smokey with just the right amount of sweet.  My wife had the flatiron steak and is very picky about her steak.  I heard her moaning over there a few times.  In a good way without a doubt.  I had to try some for myself and not only was it perfectly seasoned it was perfectly cooked.  Lightly crusted on the outside and cotton candy consistency on the inside.  We ordered the creme brulee for dessert, the top was freshly carmelized and still warm and the custard was better than most.  We will definltely be back.  Often."}
{"text":"Love this place, especially for breakfast.  The eggs benedict are top notch and a great drink menu as well.  If you come in for dinner on Saturday night there is usually some good live/local music too."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a new spot to call home The Rogue Tomato is where it's at! Amazing specials EVERYDAY! Cozy and amazing decor with a fine dining twist. Also brunch on Saturday and Sunday mornings is phenomenal, The Union Hills Platter is delish, yummmmm!!! Love the live music every Saturday night, gets you grooving! The owners engage with the customers which is a plus and all the employees are always smiling which is hard to find these days! This is exactly what Glendale/North Phoenix needed!"}
{"text":"I am a Saturday brunch regular here. I love their discount mimosas and mules every weekend. The bartender is the best and all the staff is friendly. I've tried everything on the brunch menu and I've only been disappointed once and that was with a new chef being hired. We let them know our displeasures and by the next return things had improved with the food. 

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the set up of the place. Nothing to do with the awesome staff.  But I always notice the bar tenders leaving their station to take orders and serve food and drinks. That just blows my mind and I've never had that happen before. At just about every establishment I can think of, the bartenders do not leave the bar. Waiters take drink orders to the bartender who makes the drinks.  Every time you force the bartender to step away you slow things down. Plus I'm a very patient person and a regular so I know how it works and I'm okay with it. But I know many people that would get sick of not being able to order a drink because the bartender is off waiting tables. I think management needs to change things up a little."}
{"text":"I've had two experiences here and they couldn't be more different! First time in, I really enjoyed the food and service. The second time, the food was delicious but the service was horrible. Frankly, it was not even the servers fault, the management and kitchen were not communicating well with regard to what was available and if orders were being prepared."}
{"text":"Rogue Tomato replaced the Chinese restaurant, Shangri-La, and completely red-did the space making it a more warm and intimate setting. The bar divides the restaurant into 2 sections. One side has a rustic brick wall while the other side has a wall sized chalk board with creative drawings and words on it. 

My husband and I came in today at an off time of 4pm while waiting for our tires to get replaced at Discount Tire nearby. The cocktails are $2 off during Happy Hour so I enjoyed a Jalapeño Margarita. It was a refreshing drink with a hint of spiciness but not that \"hot.\" I also really enjoyed the duo of shrimp tacos and the pork chili verde cup of soup. The description said the soup included tortillas but I think they forgot to bring those tortillas to me and I forgot to ask for them. 

My husband had the Rogue Burger. It seemed to have a leaner type beef used but the taste was good because of the bacon, avocado, onion string rings, and Münster cheese. He was a huge fan of the shoestring fries, as was I. We also really enjoyed the calamari. Only a few pieces were a slight bit Chewy but the rest were perfect. 

There was a little mishap with our bill and there was a bit confusion when trying to decide which menu to give us since we came so close between the tail end of lunch and barely dinner but the staff was super nice! We definitely want to return because there were quite a few main dinner entrées that were creative and sounded interesting!"}
{"text":"Such a wonderful locally owned chef inspired restaurant. The food is fantastic and if you like drinks they are also very tasty. Well worth trying them out. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is our new favorite, the food is amazing! Everything we have ordered exceeded our expections,  recommend the pecan chicken or stuffed pablano!  The staff is fantastic and even the chef,  if your lucky enough to meet him,  is amazing.   We can't wait to go back for brunch!"}
{"text":"I have mixed emotions on this place. The service was good but the food needed help. I ordered the pecan chicken and was very disappointed. The portion was very, very, very small. I had a hard time finding any meat on the chicken. It almost looked like the meat had been removed from the chicken breast or it was the smallest chicken I have ever witnessed. The rice was over cooked and the carrots under cooked. I see no reason to return and I hope you all have better luck than I did."}
{"text":"Saturday 4 of us had brunch. This was the first time this year that we ate there & the first time ever for brunch. The menu was very interesting but the entrees didn't live up to the descriptions. And the service was poor. My husband ordered eggs benedict which he returned because the poached eggs resembled hard boiled ones. My crab benedict was skimpy at best plus my potatoes were very cold. Since we had guests with us & my husband was already complaining  I decided to just be quiet. We ordered the carrot cake which we had loved in the past but threw away this time.  The waitress didn't even ask us how our meal was. My husband had to look for her. I don't think we will ever return."}
{"text":"Stopped here from Flagstaff on the way home to Scottsdale, and we are pledging to take the 34 minute journey to become regulars. The food is amazing with quality ingredients! 

I got the mahi mahi tacos, which were bursting with flavor that left me full and more than satisfied. My boyfriend got the Rogue burger and I couldn't stop asking for bites of his as well! The food is just too yummy! We also got a short stack of pancakes to split as an app just because everything on the menu just looked so amazing.

Service was friendly and fast. We hope to be back very soon, maybe for dinner when there is live local music playing!"}
{"text":"Had an excellent dinner here. Arrived at around 7:30 and was seated right away. Waiter was incredibly friendly. Complimentary focaccia was really good. Ordered the beef filet poblano pepper and it was delicious. My companion ordered the Cajun shrimp alfredo. The noodle I had was also delicious. 

Great dining experience. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I know that a new place has growing pains but holy cow did they hire anyone with service experience?  Sat at the bar 2 other couples and one other person. Took forever for a server( not the bartender) to ask us if we would like a drink. The food was ok. Mine came out cold. Said it was a Cajun dish. Nothing Cajun about it but ok. Wasn't anything I would eat again. The bartender would never make eye contact with you when speaking to her. Seemed she had more pressing items to do like clean or organize her credit card slips. I hope they get better bartenders since the bar is a big part of that place. I wish them the best but knowing what it takes to open and work out the kinks of a new restaurant I don't think they have a shot with the staff they have now or the way the bar is set up. Not efficient at all. Good luck."}
{"text":"Was excited to try a new restaurant in the neighborhood with the family that isn't a chain restaurant.  The food was good and the cocktails even better! Nice decor and hubby enjoyed the lighting.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Saturday noon lunch. We both ordered Reuben's which were very good. My disappointment was their condition upon arrival at our table. First sandwich was slightly burnt on top and burnt on bottom. The second sandwich was totally burnt top and bottom. The waitress immediately removed the second plate and had the sandwich remade. 

There were about 5 other tables of guests so this wasn't an over busy time. Our waitress was very good. We wouldn't make a special trip here but may stop in if we find ourselves in the area.

The bill with tip was $31 which includes one soft drink."}
{"text":"Front of building is dark. Windows are blacked out. You can't tell it's open from the outside.   Mentioned it to hostess but she didn't seem to care.  We were shown to a booth and given menu. 1 page starters and 1 page entrees. Ordered 2 Blue Moons.  Found out when we got the bill they were Mud Sharks. Tasted about the same.  Beers sat on bar for quite a while while wait staff did other things.  Mentioned beers to our waitress and she brought them over.  Orde red ribs and lemon chicken pasta.  After a while, server asked if we wanted bread and announced that it was in the freezer. We said sure. After a while a couple of breadsticks were brought out with some dipping oil an vinegar. Short afterward the entrees arrived. Lemon chicken and pasta was good. Ribs were good except for some gristle.  For a restaurant called the rogue tomato, there weren't many dishes ghat had tomatoes as an ingredient.  The lemon sauce in the lemon chicken pasta was good if a little sweet. Rib sauce was sweet and clung to the ribs. Fries were hard and cold. Coleslaw as good. Cornbread was dry.  Overall the food was good but not spectacular.  It was,a bit pricey for what you get but we'll come back to support local business and to try some of the other menu items."}
{"text":"Went in for dinner- looking for not a chain restaurant. Was pleased with the atmosphere and the hostess was very accommodating. They sat us at a high top in the bar area even though we made a reservation, I would think you'd get a normal table but ended up being ok. Just strange that they didn't mention it before we were seated. The food was good and creative. Service was definitely slow- seemed to need to have more staff because food took some time to come out."}
{"text":"Wow! Food amazing, service great & atmosphere is very unique and charming! Truly love this place after first visit, can't wait to come back for dinner. FYI- Crab Cakes soooooo YUMMY!"}
{"text":"Modern ambiance, cozy, and a great menu coupled with amazing food make this place a must. It's a rarity to see such a place on in the Northwest of Phoenix. Live music on Saturdays make this a must for a date night. I highly recommend the Rogue Burger, which was very, very good."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch due to all the good reviews. Just happened to be in the area so it worked out. Ordered the shrimp taco meal. It came with three street style small taco shells and side of Mexican style rice with corn in it. The rice was unfortunately undercooked and Luke warm when it arrived at the table. The shrimp tacos were also the same. Luke warm. However the food was delicious. Shrimp were good sized and tasty. The tacos came with cabbage and avocado based dressing. I will come again but hopefully next time the food is hotter.

On a side note:
Thursday was build your own burger day. See picture for meal options."}
{"text":"Went today for Sunday brunch....beautiful day to sit on the patio, sipping mimosas and enjoying their eggs Benedict and rosemary potatoes. Hubby had the caprese salad with a bowl of the pork chile verde- both were delicious. The atmosphere is casual but classy. Very comfortable environment, with a fairly decent craft beer selection. Although they could use a few more IPA's...ha. We will definitely come back and try the happy hour menu!"}
{"text":"Coming here for lunch starving for food. Good thing this place was not packed. I decided to order Rogue Burger and Reuben Sandwich, both came with french fries. This place have mostly great reviews and I was very glad we came here. The burger was possibly one of the best burgers I have ever had. The fries was also awesome and perfect! The Reuben Sandwich was tasty and did not disappoint. I was so impressed with the food, I asked the waitress the name of the chef that day, Saul. Will for sure come back here again especially when Saul's working. 

10/6/17: Came here during dinner. Ordered 5 Rogue Burgers and 2 Carrot Cakes to go. Got my orders fairly quick. Three of the burgers were eaten right away in the car, only two out of five came with pickles, fries and burgers were both greasy. The fries tasted similar to the first time I ate there, but the burgers were not. They were very bland and some of them had burnt edges. Roasted chili aioli was runny and tasteless. I asked the hostess who the chef was for that night after I ordered the food and it was not Saul. I was worried that there might be inconsistencies with the food and I was right! 
The carrot cake was not for me, it was very rich and too sweet for my taste. 
Very disappointed about the experience big time, I was so happy before that there was an amazing burger place close to home. 
I will give this place a try one more time only when Chef Saul is working. If I get the same first fabulous experience, then I know where the problem is."}
{"text":"It was okay.  I assumed it was italian, but it was good, but not great."}
{"text":"I think they made a good try but this place is mediocre at best. Went here with my Mum for brunch, we split Pork Chili Verde and Lemon Ricotta Pancakes and I also ordered a mimosa. The bill was about $30. Portions are un-American in that they were small. The Pork Chili was more of a soup served with tortillas but it was much too watery. I've had this dish at multiple places and this was the worst rendition. It was bland too, not spicy enough. Both orders were small and left too much empty space on the plates they came with. My Mimosa was only filled up half way and it looks very frugal on their part. You wonder if they are running out of food or trying to make end's meet but I would not come back."}
{"text":"went there for a power lunch -- HA!   Actually, it was to discuss business for a committee I'm on.   Weekends are brunch time; therefore, we ordered off the brunch menu.   I ordered the pork chili verde.   I've had that at other restaurants and was expecting something tasty.

It had huge chunks of meat in it, and it came in a sort of starchy sauce.   It did have the green chili and bits of onion with a light dusting of cheese.

It was rather bland and starchy.   I can't say it was tasty at all, quite frankly.   I was thinking of ordering eggs, ham, and hash browns, since it was brunch, but thought I'd go with the chili verde since I've liked it when I've had it prior.

Next time I'll stick with eggs, ham and hash browns.   After all, one can't really do all that much with that."}
{"text":"The food is imaginative and always delicious. Nights with live music get pretty busy. We were a little disappointed when they raised their menu prices. The food is still as good but just not as good a value as it used to be."}
{"text":"Very, very slow wait staff and food. Eggs were luke warm after a long wait too. Not very busy to justify slowness . Waitress was not efficient or friendly .Appeared like she was trying to get through the morning"}
{"text":"My criteria for a good restaurant is as follows: Great ambiance, fantastic food, good service, and well thought out wine list. \"The Rogue Tomato\" exceeded my expectations in all areas! Love, love, love the feel of this place! I took my teens with me the other night. My son's words were, \"This is the best burger I think I've ever had.\" My daughter expressed, \"I really wish this place was closer because I think we'd be there all the time.\" She is right. The only downside is it is not close to us in 'tukee. :( ...definitely worth the drive, however! The chefs take great pride in giving customers what they want, so they're very open to suggestions, yet are providing tried and true dishes on the menu from their vast experience. 

I absolutely LOVE their crab cakes. I see someone else mentioned that as well. And, the Cajun Shrimp Alfredo, recommended by Chef Devin himself, was out of this world! So glad I ordered it and paired with a nice wine. I tasted a bite of my son's \"Rogue Burger\" and I have to agree. It's the best I have tasted anywhere and could potentially become their most famous thing on the menu. 

But then, there's dessert, so you can't stop at the entree!!! The three of us tasted a very intense flour-less chocolate cake, carrot cake, and lemon/raspberry cheesecake. I usually can't make it to dessert from being stuffed on everything else, but I made an exception this time. So glad I did!! Everyone around us was raving about the carrot cake and I can see why. It's absolutely perfect in texture, moistness and flavor. If you like chocolate, I mean REALLY like chocolate, just one bite of the chocolate cake will satisfy. I'm a big cheesecake eater and this was better than any New York specialty. I could see going to The Rogue simply for dessert and coffee after a movie or a concert.

Last mention, the manager, hostess and our server were all so friendly and the chefs made it a point to come around and get feedback from customers. That's a class act! It feels like they really want to serve the very best and be that restaurant that's a step above the rest. It's so great that they're not a chain and are serving dishes they are passionate about - so tired of chains in Phoenix! It's casual, but it's classy too and there are so many good things to choose on the menu that I know I will have to return and return again to get to them all! Great job. I will be back ... with all my 'tukee friends, so they can have the same great experience I had! Gotta share the love!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad the Rogue Tomato is in my neighborhood! My favorite item is the avocado taco, but they only have it at lunch. Why???? I'd be here once a week for dinner if you had it for dinner.  #moreavocadoplease

Seriously. Even if you're a carnivore. Get the fried avocado taco. 
(One complaint - the mixed drinks are usually very sweet. Just get the wine.)"}
{"text":"4 stars bc of ambiance and lunch specials. Glendale really needs more places like this and since there aren't many, that's why I bumped it up a star. Food is decent to good. The lunch special is a great deal. The first cocktail on the menu was terrible. I was almost forcing myself to drink it bc it was pricey, but it just wouldn't go down. The calamari appetizer however was delicious! The Cajun shrimp Alfredo was nothing special but didn't taste terrible. I would like to try this place for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Excellent crab and egg Benedict and lemon ricotta pancakes to balance it off - must try!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Ordered the Rogue Burger, it was perfectly cooked. The fries were good. My husband also had the red pepper bisque which he said was very good. 
The best part was the service. Kyle is the best waiter we've had in all of Arizona. He was very friendly and attentive. 
Definitely will be back!
Wanted to try the carrot cake but unable due to walnut allergy. Opted for the lemon cheesecake, was very good as well."}
{"text":"The food is good and the people who CV work there are friendly and eager to please. Terrific design inside , really cute"}
{"text":"Coming here is a risk.  The food is great but customer service sucks.  Also don't attempt to come here without a reservation.  If i would of invited 2 less people they might of still gotten worst table in the joint.  Something told me that I didn't get seated because of the color of my skin.  My money is still green and my debit card is still plastic."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place! Wow!! Absolutely delicious! The beer cheese is phenomenal but everything was excellent!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast or brunch. Food was fantastic and service was great. Great atmosphere and a nice outdoor seating area."}
{"text":"Wow! What a hidden gem in Peoria! I found Rogue Tomato via Yelp and I am throughly impressed. The decor is great. The service is fantastic, (I had a minor hiccup with my meal and the entire team was so egar and willing to fix it right away) and the food is wonderful! Get the bacon, I dont care what you get it on, but get the dang bacon! We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Monday night, found out happy hour was 3 til close. Weren't very many tables taken but that was probably a good thing because the service was great. Food was amazing too, will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Review update:
Have been back twice since first visit and the food is on point. But the service is consistently incredibly slow. It doesn't matter if it's 2 people or 11 ( like we had last night for my MILs birthday). We waited 45 minutes, 45 MINUTES from being seated until we got our first cocktail. Our server was doing her best and her manager should have been helping her out. There was no apology or anything. Plan for a minimum of an hour during non peak times and more for a Saturday night. I had made a reservation for our large party and it took them 15 minutes to seat us -- no apology. What's the point of making a reservation? When I made the reservation, they knew it was my MILs birthday and said she would get a  complimentary dessert but that didn't happen. Bottom line--the food is great but I won't come back until they get their sh*t together. 

This is a cool spot and I can't wait to go back and try dinner. Breakfast was pretty good! They were really short staffed but our server hustled and really did her best. That was all I could complain about.

I had the frittata of which was good. Lots of fresh veggies, a nice sausage and cotija cheese. I'd eat cardboard if it had cotija cheese on it. While I liked the frittata, the star of the show is those rosemary brekkie potatoes!! Wow! They should make an entree with those as a base with runny eggs and some sort of gravy. That would be sassy.

The hubs had the Benedict. We came here because my SIL has been coming here and found out the chef used to be at L'Auberge de Sedona and we used to dream about their benedicts! He was not disappointed!

The child enjoyed her pancake. I had a bite and it was light and fluffy and they use real syrup so that's always a good sign. 

Good spot, will def return!"}
{"text":"Went in for brunch this morning before bridal dress shopping. It was all our first time here and we chose it because we were able to make a reservation for the 8 of us and there was great reviews on yelp. The decor was fun and modern with a rustic touch. Lots of room and a big bar in the center. Our server was Colleen and she was amazing! She was so friendly and made sure we always had full water, bloody Mary's and coffee.

The bloody Mary's were good and they have great coffee! Server made sure to keep the cup full! All the food was delicious too. We got a little bit of everything and there was no complaints. I have been eating healthy so I got the tossed caprese salad and it was so good. The dressing was refreshing and the salad was crisp. I could of licked the plate clean. 

Everything was great from the server to the food. Everything was quick too which allowed us time to talk and enjoy company after eating. Everyone was talking about how we are excited to come back for lunch or dinner and bring our significant others. Highly recommend to try! Can't wait to come back! Thank you (:"}
{"text":"Waitress was very nice, a bit slow on drink refills, food was average. A bit pushy to clear our whole table including drinks that we are not finished with. Our table was a bit wobbly, hostess said she would try to fix it and she never came back."}
{"text":"Nice breakfast! Tasty, light frittata. My wife had the corned beef Benedict (Huevos y Centeno). Well done! Good, friendly service."}
{"text":"So yummy! Went on Mother's Day for brunch. They had the Californian Eggs Benedict. Crispy bacon instead of Canadian bacon and added avocado. The side of rosemary potatoes were so flavorful and good. So delicious. Hubby got the rogue burger which he said was phenomenal. Stole a couple of his fries and hey we're delicious. Also had their version of the Moscow mule, was amazing."}
{"text":"This place is the effing bee's knees. I've been a bunch of times and am always satisfied. The burgers are delicious and juicy. The appetizers are all top notch. The beer selection is great. The breakfast and brunch options are unique and all delicious. The atmosphere is comfortable and clean I love all the stupid hipster crap on the walls. The service is quick and friendly. I spilled half my burger on my lap and they still treated me like a normal person not like the trash that I really am. I'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"This was actually my second time here. The first time was with a bunch of friends for lunch and it was really good. Yesterday Ashley S mentioned they were now open for breakfast so off I went. Got there just before 7 and were the first customers. Even though the forecast for the day was 117° it was still cool enough in the morning to enjoy the patio. I had a friend with me who had never been here. Because the breakfast menu was not yet on line I had to warn him I had no clue what I was dragging him in to. They have only been open for breakfast since Monday. Not to worry, I had Eggs Benedict and he had Huevos Rancheros and they were both great. Speaking of great, the coffee is excellent. I always drink mine black and my friend cut way back on his cream and sugar so he could get more coffee flavor. I really have enjoyed both of my visits here and being only a couple of miles away I am sure I will come again."}
{"text":"Based on three visits, I'm giving this place a thumbs up. My first visit - lunch - was a meh affair. I had Salmon burgers and they tasted mostly like charcoal; but I appreciate non-chain places and Rogue Tomato tries to bring a little bit of trendy to the West Valley. You'd expect to see a place like this in Scottsdale instead of Glendale/Peoria. So I gave it another try for breakfast and it won me over. The food was fantastic (oatmeal pancakes) and the coffee was good. Same good quality for the next breakfast. And the fancy little touches don't hurt either. Plus the staff is always friendly. Worth a shot if you want a local restaurant that is more than a hole in the wall."}
{"text":"We were bummed when we first arrived because we were unaware that on Sunday's they only offer their brunch menu, which is super limited and doesn't offer any appetizers. The wait time for the food was pretty long but well worth it. The food was delicious! We got the chicken flatbread and classic burger. The dessert, again, took a very long time to get and we wouldn't order it next time, we tried the lemon cheesecake and it just wasn't very good. Our bill came to $67 (without 20% tip) which is pretty pricey for a brunch menu but we did get drinks. Over all, the food was amazing but we probably wouldn't come again unless we wanted to try a live music night."}
{"text":"I was invited for a celebration dinner.  My bro got a promotion!!   We made a reservation for 8.  We arrived and was seated within 5 mins.  The place is nice, clean, and open.  The bar is in the middle of the place.  They have indoors and outdoors for seating.  Menu looks good and lots of selections.  Our server was nice but she was very forgetful.  We had a kid and he needed a kid's menu.  Never came, I got up to ask for one at the hostess' station.  She took our orders then 10 mins she came back to confirm our orders.  Then she came back to inform us that one of the dish they were out, but she did not remember who ordered what.  OMG!  The service was so so slow.  We had to ask anyone working by for refills.  I ordered the St. Louis Ribs.  Ribs were good and tender.  That was the highlight of the visit."}
{"text":"Outstanding Food & service. I had the chicken pesto flatbread. Excellent & well priced. Cool place! Definately will return."}
{"text":"Seems like everytime I come, my food and experience just gets better and better! Their breakfast is delicious and beautiful - my favorite is the lemon ricotta pancakes so far, but I haven't had a full tour of the menu yet. ;) Lunch is perfectly portioned, and each dish is unique and inspired, but feels like cozy home cooking at the same time. The salads are well balanced and fresh, the burgers are godly, and the sides and apps almost steal the spotlight from your meal! 
Gotta say though - I can't come here without ordering a cocktail. And you shouldn't either. 
And to top it off, the waitstaff are super friendly and attentive. Smiles, jokes, fast service - everything you could ask for!
Now the real test will come once I finally have dinner and dessert here... But I'm sure they'll once again, exceed my expectations."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by last night for our first visit.  I love the atmosphere and was dying to find a good neighborhood eatery to take out-of-town guests and I think I found it.  

I ordered a Jeff's Hot Rum and it was just perfect on a rare cold rainy night.  I thought I saw it for $5 on the blackboard but it appeared for $7 on my bill.  I selected the pretzel chorizo fondue for appetizer and it was delicious.   

For the main course I selected the pan seared scallops served in a Sonoran style polenta.  The presentation was good. I was a little disappointed that my five scallops were barely medium size but worse, they were overlooked.   I understand rubbery but these were completely overdone.  My wife ordered the Flat Iron Steak medium but it came out medium rare with plenty of blood draining out.  

Overall our experience was great, server professional, but I left a little disappointed due to my scallops.  

Since this is a local joint we will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I was excited to get a non chain breakfast spot in the area!  We went on a Sunday morning and it wasn't very busy.  Service was very slow and menu was a little pricier than it should be.  Food was good and loved the ambiance."}
{"text":"Great service, awesome food and yummy drinks! Thank you Ren for being so helpful and super funny! We had an awesome time!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Large variety to choose from (went for dinner). Staff was very friendly and polite without being pushy, they took care of us well! Will be back soon I'm sure."}
{"text":"Great food, fantastic service! Austin provided the best service! Portions were perfect. Loved the atmosphere. My sons ate their entire meal, and thats saying alot because they are very picky. We will be regular customers."}
{"text":"The server was a super nice lady, aside from that the decor was great. That's where the positive review ends. Food took forever to come out... why? One guy in the kitchen... on Friday night. Never going back I over paid for food I could have made I. The dark, drunk. Waste of my hard earned money."}
{"text":"The people here are amazingly friendly and efficient. The food is great and I can't wait to go back and try the breakfast menu!"}
{"text":"Almost 30 minutes for our mediocre food to come out on a slow Thursday, and our waitress asked, \"did that take a while for your food, it sure seems like it\", and then walks away. Serious? Fries were room temp and oily, burger was very undercooked. Service was OK, and the bar and quality of drinks were the only saving grace for this place. Seems like a great place for retirees from the Midwest who consider Red Robin as a solid food choice."}
{"text":"I found this place on accident and will definitely be back. The bartender, I believe it was Brittany, was nice and conversational and her choice of the rogue burger was delicious. The atmosphere was exactly what I like and there was live music that wasn't overwhelming."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night, the place was busy but the staff made us feel welcome. Food was delicious and beautifully plated, this is definitely a place to check out!"}
{"text":"This review could've been 5 stars but the service was bad. 

First off, we wanted to try something new and exciting so we checked out the Rogue Tomato. The food was incredible! The Sonoran Quesadilla is a must try!  

Everyone was polite upon arrival and when we left but our server forgot about is after the food was delivered. When he brought out the food and asked was there anything else, my pregnant wife asked for more water. He never came back with any, never came back to check on how the food was and I assumed his shift was over after not seeing him for 20-30 minutes. Had to stop another waiter just for a to go box and our check. When our waiter dropped the check off, he apologized and said he left been busy serving bigger parties. While I understand that, you can't forget about your other tables.

I'll definitely be back snd would recommend this place. Awesome concept, great decor and incredible food! Hopefully the service will be better though next time!"}
{"text":"My husband and I got some great news today and wanted to go celebrate with a nice breakfast.  Breakfast food is by far one of our favorites and The Rogue Tomato certainly met our expectations.  We had never been there before today, so we were open to anything.

When we got there we weren't really sure if it was open because when we entered the building we didn't see anyone and the lights are pretty dim inside.  Shanda came and greeted us within a few moments and sat us right away (would have been shocked if she didn't since we were the only ones there!)...and she offered us hot coffee or other drinks to start.  She was very friendly and smiley which is always nice as it seems nobody smiles anymore...

She went and got us our drinks; the coffee was fresh and came in a nice cup with some creamer that wasn't in tiny plastic cups.  I hate those tiny plastic cups of creamer as you never know how long they have been passed around table to table.  The creamer was served in a chilled metal dish...anyway, enough about the coffee...our food was DELICIOUS!!

I ordered the cheese omelet with spinach added to it.  This came with potatoes and toast.  My husband ordered the fritata which also came with potatoes and toast.  The presentation was beautiful and came with nice garnishments of sliced strawberry on a slice of orange.

My egg omelet was very fluffy and cooked perfectly.  The potatoes were really good and seasoned with rosemary.  The toast was served with fresh strawberry jam.  My husband said his fritata was really good (and he isn't really a fan of eggs).  We definitely will be back to try their lunch and dinner menu!"}
{"text":"Wow! You need to come here. My husband and I just had some of the most delicious food you could ask for. We started with nice fresh salads with homemade vinaigrette. I had amazing Mahi Mahi tacos which were to die for and he had salmon with a curry sauce which was also amazing. Then to top it off homemade Creme Brulee and Pistachio Ginger Carrot cake. Now I am waddling to the car! Lol but oh so good..."}
{"text":"I would give a 5/5 if the service and lighting inside were a tad better. We have been here 3 times, every time the food has been so so delicious (Eggs Benedict, Pork eggs Benedict, Rogue burger, so good!) But when we walk in sometimes we stand there awkwardly for a little bit before being sat even though other workers like behind the bar can obviously see us. And after we sit it's a little while before we are approached. The workers we have dealt with are all pleasant! Just the wait and inside is a little dark. Food excellent!"}
{"text":"The food is very good, I loved the meat loaf and the lemon mascarpone cheesecake was terrific. The waitress was very friendly."}
{"text":"Living in the West Valley, we are extremely limited in locally owned restaurants that are good. The place was fantastic. Hidden away in a neighborhood mall at the corner of Union Hills and 59th is Rogue Tomato and I highly recommend it. Service was great. Very friendly atmosphere and the food was excellent. My wife had the Portobello Mushroom panini and a Mudshark Full Moon ale from Lake Havasu City, now her favorite new brew! I had the Carne Asada tacos there were extremely tasty with bits of pineapple that made it taste even better! The rice had corn and spices and was delightful. Presentation was splendid and we met the owner as we left and he was quite genial and happy to see us. This is our new \"go to\" restaurant and we both give it two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with high expectations. I am giving the rating that I am because of the limited options on the brunch menu I received, and the lack of affordable options. Nothing really caught my fancy, so I just went with the basic 2 eggs any style breakfast. Our server had poor memory despite writing things down. Maybe their lunch or dinner menu is better but I don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"First time going in and was not impressed. Slow staff where one of the gals was writing on the chalk board for the whole time she was still writing when we left an hour later. 
There was 6 of us and took forever to get our food. Never offered another drink. 
Liked the environment but service was slow with a lot of employees doing nothing. Food was just OK. Overpriced for what you get in this area. 
We are not in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Simply amazing top-notch service we reserve the table when we got there our table was already ready with water glasses there., could not of asked for better service completely amazing attention to detail. Definitely going back., have the mahi-mahi tacos to die for"}
{"text":"Both times I went here I made reservations and sat there while they seated walk-ins before us. The first time we waited 30 minutes and the second time we left because they seated a walk-in party with the same number of people. We had hoped they had resolved their service issues from our first visit, but clearly not."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times now and have always sat at the bar. Bartenders Alicia and Johnny are great. Very knowledgeable and friendly. The food and wine is delicious, decor beautiful. 
It's so refreshing to have a restaurant like this in Glendale. They also support local business and have music most Friday and saturday's.
I highly recommend going! I'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"Eggs any style ..... great place and vibe. Not a long wait. Homemade jam yummy ... great sausage and potatoes actually just great breakfast!! Finally found a brunch spot after Church yay"}
{"text":"My husband and I were in an unfamiliar part of town for a morning doctor appointment. We wanted a little something for breakfast and saw a sign for a fast food restaurant. We pulled into a parking lot to find it and saw a sign that said now serving breakfast. We looked up and the restaurant was called Rogue Tomato. Always up for new dining experiences, we decided to go in and check it out. 

When we walked in the décor was delightful. It was very distinctive and created the perfect ambiance to feel welcome. There was a chalk board wall that accentuated the room and had a welcoming feel. The menus were unique and displayed the food in a very creative manner.
  
I had a hard time deciding what to order. There were so many creative options that looked enticing. I decided on the Crab Egg Benedict. It came beautifully presented on my plate. My husband ordered Eggs any Style, also beautifully presented. Both dishes came with rosemary potatoes. My husband's plate came with a freshly made jam. All of the food was amazing. The rosemary potatoes were the absolutely best breakfast potatoes I have ever eaten. I ordered a mimosa with my meal. It was very yummy as well. 

The service was just as amazing as the food and décor. Chanda was the server that waited on us and she has an outgoing, welcoming, professional personality. Overall I was impressed enough with this restaurant to take my time to write this review. Even though it is 54 miles from my house, I will be back. I want to try some more of the menu options."}
{"text":"Great little place.  My niece and I went for lunch last week.  Food was good but the defining aspect was the service.  So attentive.  The beer and wine selection was great.  The menu was decent.  Definitely will return"}
{"text":"What a lovely breakfast experience. Austin was our server and he was attentive, informative, and very nice. The restaurant itself is beautiful and cozy and a nice break from the regular Glendale scene. It's very refreshing. The food was BOMB. I had the crab cake Benedict and it was fresh, seasoned well, and the potatoes are perfect! My boyfriend had the huevos rancheros and he commented \"tastes like Mexico!\" And we both cleared our plates! 

Overall a great experience, I'll be bringing my girlfriends back for a wine and dinner night! And happy hour of course! It's a good place for adults but I wouldn't bring kiddos here - it's not that kind of place (my own personal opinion)"}
{"text":"This is a nice little gem in the area. A little more upscale for when you want to dress up but you could also go casual. The food is awesome. I loved the meatloaf. Service was really great. Very friendly, attentive staff. Just all around a great place. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I visited The Rogue Tomato today with a group of my colleagues. We started with the pretzel and chorizo fondue which was pretty bad - the cheese sauce had broken and was very grainy. Our server was nowhere to be found, so we waited until our entrees were being delivered, and advised the gentleman bringing our food. He was very nice about it, and immediately offered to either have a new batch made up or to take it off the bill. Since our food was already arriving, we opted for the second option. For our entrees, two of us split the prime rib sliders and the roasted green tomato bacon melt. Both were delicious, as were the fries that came with them! The horseradish aioli on the prime rib sliders was a bit much for my taste, but that's just a taste thing. Even with it, they were great! 

Unfortunately, overall the service was very poor. As I mentioned, we didn't see our server any time between the delivery of our appetizer and the delivery of our entrees. Then, we had to try several times to flag her down for drink refills. After we got her attention and indicated we needed something, we watched her head back to the kitchen, deliver other items, enter an order into the system and check in with another table before stopping by to see what we needed. By then we had all been out of drinks for about 10 minutes. The table behind us also tried flagging her down several times, and finally went up to the counter to make their request. We were planning to order dessert, but when the server later returned to our table, she just asked if we wanted separate checks. So, we took that as our invitation to leave.

Overall, I would definitely come here again, but hope that with time they can work out the food service kinks. The restaurant was not full, so I'm not sure if it was a matter of under-staffing or new staff. Either way, most of the food was good, and I have high hopes for a good experience on my next visit."}
{"text":"The menu is short and basic, not much selection or variety- and expensive for the amount and quality of the food you get. The restaurant had 5 full tables and they thought it was a good idea to sit us between the kitchen door and bathrooms..so unappealing (they also have a room spray over the kitchen door which makes it even more unappealing). We ordered the Belgian waffle ($9) and crab Benedict ($13) - you get a basic waffle, no more than a dozen blueberries and 2 small cut up strawberries, the Benedict was simply disgusting! Served with a stingy side of the previous night's left over potatoes (overly seasoned and lukewarm at best). I'll wait in a 30min line at the place or black bear next time - lesson learned!!! Will never go back to this place."}
{"text":"Great Food and Service! We stopped for a quick meal on a Monday night and were not disappointed. Happy Hour 3PM to close on Monday's, so were enjoyed some fantastic shrimp tacos. Can't wait to try more items next time! The restaurant is very clean, with a nice atmosphere. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere and great food. Everything on the lunch menu looked good. We got the quesadilla and caprese salad and ate every bite. We also got the carrot cake which was delicious. Our server Kellie did a great job giving us suggestions on what to order and you could tell she had a real passion for the restaurant which is really nice to see. I'll be coming back here many times, the breakfast and dinner menus looked just as awesome as the lunch menu did."}
{"text":"Turned away by inexperienced and rude hostess. Said they were short staffed and quoted us an outlandish wait time despite several open tables and an open patio. Pretty disappointed and sad we didn't get to try the new restaurant. Not inspired to come back. Nothing like a sarcastic and condescending staff member to turn you away from a business entirely."}
{"text":"Terrible service, food was cold and not delivered at the same time. My husband had to wait for his food because they messed it up. Manager was rude when she apologized, but didn't mean it it was not busy at all and we waited 40 minutes for cold food"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to here today on our lunch break. We arrived at 11:45 and there were 2 parties waiting to be seated ahead of us. As we were waiting to be seated, 4 more parties arrived after us. We were waiting well over 5 minutes for someone to come greet us. Finally a lady came over to the hostess area but we were told that there would be at least a 15 minute wait to be seated even though the restaurant was practically empty. We counted 3 tables that were taken. My husband asked why there was a wait when the restaurant was empty. The lady kind of laughed and said there were only 2 people working at the moment. My husband then asked if we could just go sit at a table and the lady said, \"sure but we still won't get to you for at least 15 minutes\". She was rude and never even offered an apology. Even if there were only 2 servers, there is no reason in the world to make customers wait \"at least 15 minutes\" to be seated during lunch hour in an empty restaurant."}
{"text":"New restaurant you will have to come and try! The Rogue Tomato is the perfect restaurant for this location. I had the calamari for an appetizer, the ribeye and Asiago mashed potatoes for dinner and carrot cake for dessert! The calamari was breaded perfectly with a tasty sauce on top. My ribeye was grilled to my liking and the Asiago mashed potatoes were creamy and savory. The carrot cake was garnished with pistachios which made my mouth water! I was delighted to hear that the desserts are made in the kitchen and not frozen out of a box. I can't wait to come back and eat here again!"}
{"text":"Under new ownership and it's really so disappointing. Why people mess with a good thing is beyond me. This place was great, downtown vibes in Glendale. Great food and service. Well, that's out the window. 

It's still a cute place and the food is still good, but damn... it's called the service industry folks. Gotta know how to to serve. 

We called the day prior for a party of 6 and two little ones and were told, \"Don't expect the server to do split checks, some will refuse.\" Um... Awkward? I called back and asked for a manager because I didn't want the headache when we got there; Manager Dan said it was no problem and the communication has been lacking regarding new policies. Sweet, we're good to go. 

We arrive ten minutes early and sit promptly at 7. Order everything by 7:10. Drinks are served about 7:25, appetizer pretzel served cold at 7:50, entrees served at 8:15. Everyone around us looked piiiiissed. Tables weren't getting greeted for a long time, credit cards sat waiting to be processed. 

No manager on shift. Our server was trying but had 6-8 tables all over the restaurant and only an inexperienced hostess to help. There was a bartender but she didn't do much the hour forty five we were there. One server on a night where you're offering 3-close happy hour might not be the best policy. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Ohh my goodness! The reviews did not disappoint!! I got the strawberry lemon sangria. It was sooo good, definitely on the sweeter side. So I can only do one. We had the bruschetta appetizer. IT WAS SOO GOOD!!! 
I had the Rogue veggie burger which one of BEST VEGGIE BURGERS I've ever had. Probably cause they make it fresh in house. I asked for a side of BBQ just in case. Which I didn't need but it didn't hurt. There BBQ sauce is BOMB!! My husband had the Rogue burger and he LOVED IT!  Service was excellent!!!! I would definitely eat here again and again and again and so on. Lol"}
{"text":"Great food! I had the rogue burger cooked medium. It had delicious thick bacon on it, guacamole, crispy onion straws and came on a ciabatta bun. The fries were also delicious and fried just the way I love them, just crispy enough without overdoing it. Service was also fantastic and very a tentative. Real cool place/ feel."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. Nice trendy place. I ordered the lunch combo with calamari salad and bisque. It also came with a side of fries. Portions were on the small side. Calamari looked a little on the over cooked side but salad tasted great otherwise. My uncle got the carnitas tacos and he said he enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Finally, a locally owned gastropub-type restaurant for us in the West Valley. They've got a unique menu, and it's apparently owned by the chefs. I always feel good about a place that's food-first.

Two things keep me from giving them 5 stars: the service was SLOW at our last visit, and the prices are kinda high for some of the things you get. Take the fish tacos, for instance. Clearly frozen fish, but I'm paying the price it's be if it was ocean-caught that morning. That kind of stuff will work itself out the longer they're open, though."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was good. Server we had was good. Wait time for brunch was very long over 45 mins. Spoke to duty manager Jenn who apologized but did not seem genuine in her concern. Once we received food it was okay not worth the wait time however."}
{"text":"Poor service and food was not that great either. It took a while to be seated and the waitress never checked on us to refill drinks."}
{"text":"Absolutely bad ass food. Cajun shrimp fettuccine BOMB! Rouge burger and fries, BOMB! Oh and we had the pretzels with munster cheese sprinkled with Chareeso, also BOMB! When we went it wasn't to busy and our server Austin knew his stuff great server. Almost forgot, the lemon cheesecake is AMAZING. Bottom line... GREAT FOOD, AND GREAT SERVICE. well be back soon to try more."}
{"text":"Very good quality food for a local restaurant in glendale! Great service and bar selection as well!"}
{"text":"I had a party of 6 friends for brunch on a Saturday and we tried the Rogue Tomato. It wasn't busy and I was surprised since it was a prime time for breakfast or brunch. But, now I know why. The food sounds great but doesn't perform. The Rogue Chilaquiles was cold in the center. Friends' comment was that it was nothing but a plate of nachos. Not really a chilaquiles at all. Nothing was outstanding of the 7 dishes we ordered. The blueberry oatmeal pancakes that we shared was the best of the bunch, but $10 for three small pancakes with a couple berries rolling around didn't impress. There are too many awesome locations for breakfast and brunch to waste money here."}
{"text":"About time we  have a restaurant of this uniqueness in the west valley.  Food is fabulous, atmosphere is great and you have to try the pork tacos mmmmm"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast and had the ricotta pancakes, rosemary potatoes and eggs. The food is gourmet quality.  Prices are reasonable in return for both high end food and atmosphere.  The atmosphere is one of a kind along with extremely friendly staff. Live music every Saturday night too. With this part of town being over saturated with chain restaurants, this place has a charm of it's own and is our new #1 spot for breakfast, dinner, weekday specials and live music on the weekend."}
{"text":"Came here from a recommendation of a friend. Glad I did ! Had the Rogue Burger. What a delicious combination of toppings!  $12 for a burger? It was WORTH it!                                      ."}
{"text":"I love this place! Sometimes we go for drinks after work (the drinks are amazing!), sometimes for lunch and sometimes for Dinner too. Everyone is always attentive, fun and pleasant. As I mentioned some of their drinks are delicious. The cucumber jalapeño margarita is very yummy! Speaking of yummy, their fries with the special sauce are a fantastic choice to pair with your adult beverage. As for their meals, everything is delicious. Their burgers are to die for. Always enjoy my time there."}
{"text":"We came here once and it was great. Today we came in and they didn't update their hours so we sat down and it was last call. They close at 3:00 pm now on Sundays FYI. Hours have not been updated."}
{"text":"The food here was amazing and the service is great.  It's a cool little place with a comfortable, welcoming atmosphere.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Tucked away in a spot, we found a Groupon. The food was pretty tasty and they have a good spin on some classics. I recommend it if you are in the area."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very delicious and not another chain restaurant.  The food is very fresh and homemade and it has a very good vibe inside."}
{"text":"Let's face it. This area of Glendale isn't really what anyone considers to be a culinary destination. In fact, when I first saw reviews of Rogue Tomato, I didn't really take them seriously. Standards in this neighborhood aren't really what I consider to be high. Initially, after putting them to the test a couple of times, I felt those positive reviews were completely justified. Unfortunately, it appears that after every visit, our opinion of them keeps dropping, which I mostly blame on inconsistencies with food preparation.

Their brunch, which impressed us at first, seems to be their biggest offender. Everything from undercooked pancakes that come out like mush, home fries that are soggy and old, and an unforgettable instance where they forgot to add cheese to my eggs and offered to nuke them in the microwave. Ugh! Even their jam, which at one point, tasted homemade and filled with chunks, is practically just fruity syrup now.

As for dinner: it's tough. The one (and only) time we ordered their Rogue Burger, it was excellent. In fact, I declared it one of the best we've found in Phoenix - so I wasn't surprised to see it pop up on a local critic's Top 25 burgers list recently. I'm glad that they can still deliver in this regard.

We did a Thanksgiving Dinner here once year to deviate from our usual choice, as well as Valentine's Day. Both were okay, although I believe a different chef was running the kitchen back then.

They put their carrot cake over pretty hard here. I'm not a fan of carrot cake regardless, but my girlfriend, who appreciates it more than I, definitely believes that it's one areas that they've really nailed down to a science. So kudos to them for their carrot cake, or at least for the one time we did try it.  

Overall, I have mixed feelings on Rogue. The vibe and décor is incredibly cool and a welcoming addition to a bland neighborhood that desperately needs great restaurants. I like their live music and on a good day/night, their food can really deliver. But over time, with all of the inconsistencies with service and food quality, I think Rogue has gotten a bit too comfortable, which hopefully won't hurt them in the long run.

If the kitchen is firing on all cylinders, you'll be pleased. But my girlfriend and I have dined here enough times to accept that it's not always a guarantee."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place for brunch but turned into a disappointment. Arrived at 10:30 on Sunday and had a 10 minute wait even though they were only about 70% full. The hostesses seemed disinterested in extending any unnecessary human contact. Not a good start. Ordered bloody Mary's once seated. Drinks came quickly but the pre-made mix was not my style; no spice, no horseradish, tasty like lime juice. On to the food! My Dad had chilaquiles which he enjoyed. I had the breakfast burrito which was okay, but again no spice. It was odd to have rosemary potatoes in a chorizo burrito. Not bad, but not my fave. Cholula helped! Server was very nice but it was sooo slow. Maybe they were short staffed? Plus side, the decor was nice! Sad to say I won't be back."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere were really good, especially for a first date. Not too dark or too light. The server mixed up our dishes, but we still enjoyed everything. Both had the garlic crusted flat iron steak and it was delicious. Very filling for a smaller cut as well. Did not need to salt or season the food at all. The chefs know what they're doing here. Going to try the Rogue Burger, on a Thursday as suggested by our wait staff, the next visit. Would recommend to anyone and everyone."}
{"text":"Delicious! I had the Mahi Mahi tacos with cilantro rice and my fiancé had the BBQ flatbread. Very delicious! Everything is made fresh! Can't wait to come back for brunch!"}
{"text":"This place is just marginal at best. Our hostess wanted us to wait while she cleaned a booth with at least a dozen open tables. Both my breakfast companion and I were very disappointed. A $12.00 breakfast with one price of toast. The portions are small and the overall service was lousy. I wouldn't recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"This place is providing great quality food and very good service. Their breakfast (my favorite meal of the day) is made with skill. The blueberry oatmeal pancake and good old eggs bacon and potatoes are my favorites. 

I have also had their fish tacos during happy hour. If you don't like it fried, no problem. They will grill the fish for you. This is not fast food so don't expect your meal in 5 minutes. But, It is worth the wait. 

The staff is very friendly and they got to know my name quickly and they make me feel welcome every time.

They also have live music on weekends."}
{"text":"Dropped in while traveling on business. Great food (flathead and taco Tuesday) and great conversation with the staff. Will be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I am giving my experience two stars because the restaurant is new to the area and I hope they can work out the kinks. My husband and I arrived at the restaurant and waited a few minutes to be greeted by anyone. What I am assuming was a server told us the hostess was busy (getting waters for a table) and took our name. We put our name in for six since we were meeting some friends. We sat at the bar while we were waiting and we probably sat there for a good ten minutes before ordering our drinks. In this ten minutes...one person cleared the dirty glass that was in front of us, another person gave us waters, another person asked if we had been helped to which we responded no and she gave us a drink list, another person asked if we ordered which we didn't so we ordered from her, she gave me my drink but there weren't enough clean beer glasses for my husband so he waited another few minutes, finally we both had drinks. The people next to us told us they had a similar experience. We immediately called our friends and told them to meet us at a different restaurant. The Rogue Tomato has a front of the house identity crisis on their hands, no one that attempted to serve us had a clear role.  I hope they figure it out soon, the atmosphere is what this neighborhood needs."}
{"text":"I have to take a moment to write this review. We were in for dinner last weekend. We drove out of our way to because we were craving the pretzel chorizo fondue (amazing! Promise me you will try it?!?).

We Expected to wait for a bit, it was a Saturday evening. Put our name down and sat in the little sitting area. We were pleasantly surprised to have Uncle Bear Brewery there sampling beer, plus some live music. Now, I am not a huge beer drinker and neither is my husband, but we sampled it and enjoyed what we tried. We did end up purchasing a growler to take home (try the peanut butter port and the blue berry!).

Enjoyed our very delicious dinner and the wonderful service that we had. The environment is welcoming, the staff is great and the food is delish.

The reason I am actually writing the review was because when we got home, I realized I left the beer on table! I called the next day and the growler was no where to be found. Genna, the owner (I believe) went above and beyond to replace the growler for me. They don't carry them, it was just a promotional item brought in by Uncle Bear. When I mean above and beyond, there were several calls involved and she put more effort and desire into solving the situation than the beer was worth! My faith was lifted and I was surprised by The Rogue Tomato's desire to fix this issue. The fact that they truly cared.

I always love supporting small business. This is one that I will continue going out of my way to support. 

Thank you, Genna. We will be back."}
{"text":"Went to Rogue Tomato for lunch today and had a wonderful experience.  What amazed me is that they just opened last Thursday and I was expecting \"typical\" opening issues from service to culinary.  To my delight our service and meals were outstanding, a sign of great training prior to opening.  Chef Devan and Shane have put their passion throughout the menu, it was difficult to make up our minds.  Good reason to go back again for more!  Our Server Haeley was polite, attentive and knowledgeable with describing menu details.  It's a breath of fresh air when the owners visited our table, unfortunately in today's world, most restaurants seem to have lost this customer connection. We look forward to going again and again, however the only negative will be my expanding waistline."}
{"text":"Went for lunch.  Had the build your own burger.  It was a fantastic burger . Hand formed perfectly cooked, ingredients were high quality.  Yummmm that was a tasty burger.  That was definitely on the my favorite burgers in a long time. I'd go back def. for lunch."}
{"text":"My friend and I went on a Saturday for the brunch. I love the atmosphere and the food was great! I had the eggs benedict, cooked perfectly. And I got a side order of sausage, which I can honestly say was the best I've ever had! I love all the chalk boards, gives the place a neat vibe. Service was excellent, staff was super friendly!  Finally we are starting to get great places for dining in the west valley!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan. We went for dinner a few nights ago. They had a great singer there which added to the experience. I had the Cajun shrimp alfredo, it was delicious. I would go back for that again for sure. Friends had burgers and they said it was the best burger they had had in a good long while. The interior was relaxed casual but nice and comfortable. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"If your looking for a relaxed, rustic, super fresh and unique food, look no further than The Rogue Tomato! Tucked away in a strip mall, this small yet open, rustic feel (feels like your NOT in Phoenix) place will make you relax and enjoy the experience. The service is attentive, although the wait for the food time on this particular day (Father's Day) was a bit slow. The breakfast menu is not large, but its very unique and super fresh. And coffee...well the best I've ever had!! 

Happy Eating!!"}
{"text":"Grabbing lunch with friends today and decided to meet here. No wait since we came close to opening . I was impressed right away with the cute sayings on the walls with awesome wall art as well. The lunch menu was great. It included options like salad, burgers, sandwiches, and a  great appetizer list. My friend ordered a chicken salad and it was huge with a full cut chicken breast. Her kids had a pizza and burger. They both ate so quickly. Sauce on their faces and all it was a hit. I ordered the Cuban sandwich and it was amazing. Crunchy pickles, tons of shredded pork and cheese. The fries were perfectly crisp, and the bread toasted just right. Our waiter was a bit slow and it took a while to get refills, but he was pleasant and helpful. He seemed to be running all the tables so I don't blame him for being a bit slow getting to our table at times. The food was great and I'll definitely spread the word and bring the family."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to find out about this restaurant and decided that I had to try it. Didn't know what to expect in terms of what kind of food it was.

They describe themselves as American, though there is a definite southwestern flair to it. I tried the blue corn crab cakes and they were just okay. They were very wet on the inside (which makes me think there was an abundance of mayonnaise) and they really weren't flavorful. Kind of a disappointment. I also had the bbq pork sliders and the best part of this dish was the shoe string fries. The fries were amazing but the sliders were either super crunchy (from the bun) or super soggy.

My biggest complaint is that I went when the restaurant was not busy at all, but it took forever to get my food.

The restaurant is somewhere between casual and more upscale, but much closer to casual. The food is lackluster and as such, overpriced. I don't plan on going back."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times and we had excellent food. The service has always been acceptable, the staff is nice but there are too few of them if anything which is what I could see people having problems with the service. I can't think of anywhere else near by that I would be excited to take my parents to eat out at if they are in town because most everything else around here is chains or counter serve/fast food."}
{"text":"We ate here for the 6th and last time on Friday night. The fish tacos were inedible and completely different from the same menu item of 2 weeks ago. My wife sent 90% of it back. My flat iron steak was dry, chewy and overcooked. I ate it all and told the waiter for future reference. We were billed for all and not asked if there was a way to remedy the experience. Previously we were billed for asparagus that was too salty and overcooked. Disgusted we left and split a pizza up the street.
Don't get comfortable with this restaurant. With these policies they won't be around long!!! There is a reason there are very few people in there !!!"}
{"text":"The owner ambushed my wife and I with a printout of previous yelp review. He was grilling my wife about how mean she was for giving them a 3 star review.

This place was new and experiencing growing pains.  Service was  slow and wine was expensive when not on happy hour. 

We heard they had live music and wanted to give them another try.

He reduced my wife to tears, and all we wanted to do was give this place a third and final chance.

This guy was a dick and nobody should spend any money at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Good food but the live music is way too loud and kind of puts me off going here more often. Everything off the menu has been fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Love the Rogue Tomato!   Whether for brunch, lunch or dinner the food has been great!   Staff is friendly, atmosphere very cool and evenings with music are a treasure.  Our go to spot!"}
{"text":"This is what the north west side has been craving, especially close to my house!  The Rouge Tomato has a local feel with a nice dark rustic feel. Came here for the first time for breakfast. Not very busy at all which is hard to believe because the food was very good. Had the crab eggs ben and my wife had the French toast. Both were really good and I'd come back just for breakfast!  

Came for a reverse happy hour on a Friday night and with live music and a great happy hour menu. Ordered a craft beer for $2 off and a flatbread which was more like a mini pizza. Was a perfect combo and very filling. We also came for taco Tuesday where the street tacos are only $2.50. 

Each time I visited the Rouge Tomato I've had a good experience. Good service and good food. I look forward to trying more menu items in the future. If you live in the area then you need to stop on by!"}
{"text":"This place was Awesome! Ask for Jennifer- she was so friendly and helpful. We had the experience of home- welcomed, and professionalism- gave us great recommendations and service. Party of 4 with all great plates- ribs, stuffed Poblano pepper and 2 hamburgers. We'll we definitely be back! And I hear they have great happy hour drink specials and live music. Look forward to see you guys again...again!"}
{"text":"Tons of workers - but hardly any service. Food was good though. If I was the chef I'd be not thrilled that the service is what pulls this restaurant down. Great ambiance - yummy drinks - below average service."}
{"text":"My friend and I came in for our annual birthday dinner last month and loved it. We started with a bottle of wine (1/2 off bottles on Wednesdays) and a caesar wedge salad. The salad was delicious and plenty to split. I wasn't super hungry, so settled with a flatbread which was delicious! My friend ordered The Rogue Burger. She said it was so delicious and exactly what a burger should be. 

I love this place and the fact that everything is made from scratch. It is hard to find places like that nowadays. The service is also outstanding. I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Great drinks, we haven't had the food yet but it smells awesome. Lay out and the decor gives it a unique feel too it. No other place in the west side like it. Bar tenders and the staff are very nice to talk and deal with too. Try their daily drink specials."}
{"text":"My husband and I went late yesterday afternoon for the first time and absolutely loved it! The food was delicious, the decor and vibe were great. We also enjoyed the music they had playing.....although it could have been turned up just a notch. They also have an outdoor seating option but do not have misters. Hopefully they add them in the near future. We are very excited to have something like the Rogue tomato so close to home and We look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Nice quiet place with happy our and a good food menu. I like the flatbread and a glass of wine. No TV so can't watch sports at the bar. L"}
{"text":"Loved it!  On the smallish side, so noise level is down, attention from staff is up.  Had burgers, as they'd been highly recommended (for good reason).  Can't wait to go back to try more on the menu.  Our server, Brittany, was spot on.  Welcoming, knowledgeable, efficient.  Will definitely request her again."}
{"text":"Great place! The cheese and pretzel dip is a great appetizer. They have great burgers, I love the make your own option. The drinks are always delicious. And brunch is good, too! I've been here on multiple occasions and I will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast this morning for first time...great selection and food was great...can't wait to come back and try the benedict people next to us were raving about..Tara and her suppoort took great care of us at the bar! Great job you guys!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the environment of this restaurant; it's very appealing for so many occasions and the staff has always been so friendly. A nice variety when it comes to their menu, I never have issues finding something I want to eat. It's perfect for a birthday dinner, graduation celebration or just a night out with friends. This is definitely something Glendale needed."}
{"text":"Loved the breakfast I had there recently. Tried the Reuben for lunch, also. Very good. Dinner experience wasn't great but would give it another try. Love the location and vibe for this area. Looking forward to attend one of the Friday night music shows."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised to find this gem in Glendale. A sophisticated menu with unique flavor combos. Great service from Mariah and visits to the table from the chef. And live music!  Worth a drive from Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I waited 45 minutes for a table and then was told our table was going to someone else with a reservation in 20 minutes. The hostess did not communicate this to us at all when we checked in, and was not very helpful. Will not try it again."}
{"text":"Everything from the atmosphere to the service to the food was top notch!! We had the chorizo cheese dip, the grilled asparagus, and the guacamole. All three of them were phenomenal. We were too stuffed for dinner but had the carrot cake and creme brûlée for dessert and they were wonderful! I took half of the carrot cake home for my husband  . . . it didn't make it home! LOL 

Super family-friendly! I had my 15-month-old  with me and they were so sweet to him. Great to have such a great restaurant in the west valley!"}
{"text":"I was craving a burger after a hard week so we decided to go to The Rogue Tomato Friday night. I've been there before and recalled their burgers were fabulous. This experience was a HUGE let down. I ordered the Rogue burger cooked medium well (a little pink), when my meal arrived the burger was burnt, literally charred black. The server quickly shuffled my burnt meal back to the kitchen to have the cook prepare a new one. ( I would like to add the server was very friendly, this review has no reflection on her job performance.) I told my boyfriend to continue to eat his meal as I didn't want his dinner to be ruined by getting cold. The second Burger came out 15 min later, it wasn't burnt however it was extremely WELL DONE (absolutely no pink)! My original burger came out with two large pieces of bacon that stuck out way past the bun. This new burger had one piece of bacon that look like it was cut in half and placed  on the burger. CHEAP shortcut. At this point I'm starving, and took a couple bites.  This is not what I ordered nor did it taste good. Frustrated, I sent Burger number 2 back and opted to throw in the towel and not order anything else. The server did ask, but by this time my boyfriend was done eating his dinner. Our server informed us that they are training a new cook and she will provide feedback to the chef. So here is a tip, if a patron sends back their meal don't have the new cook prepare the second one. Obviously there was an issue with temperature and cooking time frame that he/she has not mastered yet. Our server did comp my meal however a manager never came to the table. In all honesty, I feel the entire meal should have been comped and a manager should have visited the table so proper feedback could have been provided. Very disappointed, after we left I went elsewhere to get a proper burger to satisfy the craving I was having!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place out with our friends for my birthday last month. We happened to go on Burger night (Thursday) and we all loved it so much we went back the very next time we all got together. They have live music on weekends and different themes every night of the week. We're so excited to find such a great place to eat so close to where we live!

Also, they brought out a really awesome and huge dessert for the table to share for my birthday, which was a definite plus."}
{"text":"This is a cute little restaurant with a good menu.  We ordered the Pesto Chicken and Artichoke Flatbread and the Blue Crab and Bacon Egg Benedict. The flavors of the food are delicious.  The only down side was the service we received.  We sat at the bar and normally that ensures good service but our bartress was occupied. She didn't take our food order for about 10 minutes.  Then never came back to ask if we wanted additional drinks (which we did). By the time she did ask,  it was too late. Missed opportunity."}
{"text":"This restaurant is an excellent choice for brunch. I loved the Crab & Eggs Benedict. The flavors were clean and I enjoyed that they exercised self control with their salt use. Great patio. Pleasant atmosphere."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from a friend so we decided to stop and have a late lunch after a doctor's appointment. Menu looked interesting. We had the pork chili verde appetizer, cuban sandwich and I had a turkey club one of there lunch special's. Really wanted the salmon sliders, but that will be for my next visit. My husband who is from Miami is always looking for a good Cuban sandwich. He said, this was the best he has had since he left Florida. They slow roast the pork and that made it so flavorful.The pork chili verde also tasty made from poblano chili's.  And even the turkey club was yummy. Will defiantly be going back. The service was excellent,too. This place is worth checking out and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"First off our server (I dont recall her name, but she is expecting) ...very nice. And even though she was also on bartender duty, was efficient with our table. We came right before the switch from the lunch menu to the dinner menu. The lunch menu is kinda...lunchy LOL. I wasnt trying to eat heavy so I ordered from the lunch menu but the dinner menu looked much better. No complaints on my lunch. I got crab cake appetizer with a lemony sauce. WAY too much lemon. It was better without the sauce. The crab cakes were OK. I also got a panini which was good. Would I come back, sure. But there plenty of other places Id rather try"}
{"text":"I had very high hopes for this restaurant after reading the reviews but my experience was not good. When we entered the restaurant there was an odor that was something like rotting eggs. I ordered the salmon sliders and my husband ordered the salmon Caesar salad. My meal was very tasty but my husband's salad was bitter and mainly composed of iceberg lettuce. After leaving I began having an allergic reaction. I have a severe seafood allergy and realized they must have cross contaminated their cooking surfaces. If this wasn't bad enough, my husband and I both became ill very shortly after leaving. This restaurant is a good idea but the execution is totally wrong. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Was in the area a few weeks ago for a business planning meeting, decided to meet here for brunch. The menu had a variety of drinks and entrees, and the vegetable lasagna was outstanding. Our server (older woman) very sweet and accommodating. She made it a point to check on us frequently (but not too much), and offer recommendations based on our preference and dietary restraints. Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Great small local eatery with American style flair. Great drinks and have a awesome build your own burger day! The famous rogue burger is my favorite item on the menu!"}
{"text":"Was not very busy when we came in for lunch, establishment took over 30 minutes to get our order for 4 people to the table.  Food was mediocre to decent at best.  Rogue burger was flavorful but over cooked , crab egg Benedict sucked. Best platter was huevos rancheros and cocktails.  Too many employees standing around doing nothing and so sloooow in this place to may employees and not enough customers customer service could be better and I was surprised they didn't have blue cheese dressing- also there was a girl at the bar writing on this little chalkboard the word pineapple-  she was still writing and correcting her visual appearance on this little board when we left and no she wasn't. Use the entire time.  seems to me like the owners like to waste payroll money to have so many ppl standing around doing nothing.  The table next to us was seated and took the server 15 minutes to come over and take a drink order- you'd think with everyone standing around someone would have used some teamwork and checked on tables and at least got the drink order started.  Next time I'm in Glendale I will NOT be eating at this place and between my group and I word of mouth is already getting out around campus how crappy the service in this place is.  Visually it looks nice but that's about all it's got going for it!"}
{"text":"I am delighted that this wonderful restaurant has opened in the Arrowhead area. The ambiance is locely, comfortable and inviting. The food is tatsy and of high quality. The most wonderful dish I tried was the quinoa salad ..... absolutely  AMAZING and a must try!"}
{"text":"Food was great, and price range was decent. Our servers were awesome. Definitely will be back here."}
{"text":"My family and I went here tonight because our first visit was not bad. The food was decent and we wanted to try it again. After tonight I hope they go out of business quickly!! My wife and my 2 year old sat at a table for 15 min without 1 single waitress or waiter coming to our table to offer us drinks or even take our order. 5 waiters and waitresses walked by our table without a single acknowledgement that we were even sitting there. The waiter who was serving our area felt it was more important to clear off the table behind us than it was to come to our table to ask if he could take our order or even offer us beverages. The pretentiousness of the staff was appalling!! If you dont want families with children to patronize your restaurant then say so and we will take our business elsewhere. If your gay waiters have problems with hetrosexual couples then thats discrimination, no matter who is doing the discriminating its not okay. Stay away from this place if u have kids!!!"}
{"text":"Found this place last night with family in town. Food was some of the best we have had in a while. Everyone shared a little of what they got and all was amazing. Love to see this type of place in the northwest valley. Constantly saying what a pain it is to have to travel for a quality fresh meal. Would love to see more small businesses that are unique like this joint on the west side. Will def be going again and spreading the word."}
{"text":"Great service, great atmosphere! Absolutely loved it. Amanda the bartender was fantastic, everything came out hot and in a timely manner. Definitely going back to see what the other specials are! 5 stars all the way!"}
{"text":"Good spot for dinner on the west side. My favorite thing on the menu unfortunately is only served during lunch (the carnitas tacos) which are AMAZING. They switch their menus out for each meal but there have been a few times the kitchen was still willing to put an order in off the lunch menu for me even though we were there for dinner (you just have to know what it you want off the menu cause they won't give you a lunch menu at night. The ribs are cooked very well but the BBQ sauce they use is a little bland. The drinks are good but a little overpriced. Servers are usually pretty good, we normally get the same gal at night and she does a good job. Not a bad spot for a dinner date, except that they used some kind of an acid wash on the floors or something and you can smell it pretty strong if you sit in the south side of the restaurant. North side I don't notice it, so ask to be seated over there if you're bringing a date."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner at this new restaurant. We decided to eat at the bar and glad we did. The bartender Rae was friendly and very informative. My husband took her suggestion and had the grill salmon. It was delicious. I had the meat flatbread and it was also very good. The manager Chris talked to us for awhile and told us about their nightly specials. We are so glad this opened in our neighborhood. We will definitely be back, the food was good and the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"What a GREAT place to enjoy a wonderful meal.
  The ambience, service, menu selection , plating and taste were EXTRAORDINARY and no detail was overlooked.
  North Glendale has been in desperate need of an establishment of this caliber.
  Steak, poultry and seafood selections that are wonderfully prepared. This is not a microwave restataunt so be prepared for a gastronomical sensation.
  I will definitely soon return and recommend this restaraunt to all who enjoy incredible food."}
{"text":"First off the food here is just wow and the waiter are nice and funny. All the food is served looking beautiful, the flavors of everything we had i loved. Next breakfast i eat out will be here. I need to try all the stuff here. All the staff were so nice, helpful, and happy. Very good place to go eat!"}
{"text":"Had the calamari with roasted red peppers for an appetizer and the salmon with beets and cinnamon for dinner. All topped off with the pistachio carrot cake for dessert! PHENOMENAL! Hidden gem in Glendale that tops any food that I have had in Vegas! Love the atmosphere and the service was excellent!  This place is definitely my new favorite restaurant!

I love that the food is not your standard fare. I could not put my fork down!"}
{"text":"The food was great. Mojitos were really good. Our server was great. Such a great atmosphere.  Love the new restaurant"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful time during happy hour-  The food exceptionally fresh and executed superbly.  The cup of chili verde on happy hour was bursting with flavor, the Rogue Burger and perfectly-seasoned fries were delectable.  Service was quick, attentive and our server as personable as family.  Very excited establishments like this are beginning to surface around the 59th/101 area. I wish all the best for this restaurant...Highly recommended to all!"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this place two stars is because the food was good -- thanks kitchen. The service however was atrocious. They seated us in the direct sun and wouldn't let us move despite being the only ones on the patio and begging to get out of the sun. The restaurant was almost empty and drinks took 15 minutes each. Won't be back."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants on the west side. Service and atmosphere were great. My wife loved the pork green chile soup and I was impressed by the Cajun shrimp Alfredo. You should try it. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Must try the grilled asparagus. Also the music they bring every Saturday is amazing. I am usually generous with my reviews so I wish I could give 6* to this place. Also our waitress Jennifer A+"}
{"text":"Spent Mother's Day here with my family. Despite being incredibly busy, service was spot on and our food arrived quickly after we ordered. All 6 of us tried something different and  thoroughly enjoyed everything. Definitely a place we'll be going back to again and again."}
{"text":"Saw this little gem in the paper, glad we did.  Wonderful venue for the west side.  In the back of a strip mall at 59th Ave and Union Hills you would not expect gourmet food.  We started with the fried calamari which was soft, with a crunchy outside served with pickled peppers that made the dish come together.  I had the skirt steak and my hubby had the Pecan Chicken.  This was the first time in a long time that I wished I had ordered the chicken over the steak.  The steak was cooked perfectly for me with a layer of chimichurri underneath.  The sautéed vegetables were EXCELLENT!!!  Back to the chicken, when they say \"pecan smoked\" they were not kidding.  The smoke flavor was a pleasant surprise.  It was juicy, and cooked just right.  The sweet potato orzo was a good match.  My husband said, \"this was the best chicken I have ever had\".  Three weeks old, they are still working out some bugs, but handle it so well you don't mind.  I would like something other than fries with the steak, but my husband loved them.  (I keep mentioning him because he is a tough customer).  We will be back, more to try- the halibut, Caesar wedge, tortilla soup and dessert.  Natalie was exceptional."}
{"text":"Been here a few times for dinner and even tried their brunch on a Sunday, the food is consistently high quality and the service is the same. Great neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"The food was great! Had the Classic Burger and the Classic Rubens, both were perfect! One of the reasons I chose to go to this restaurant was because of the fact that they listed a TV, thought I might catch a sport on.... Nope! They had a Natalie Wood movie on, and the TV is hidden behind the bar shelves. With that said I would definitely return, as the service was great and so was the food. The TV would just have been a bonus."}
{"text":"Get the fish tacos and crab cakes...soooooooo gooooooood! We enjoyed the live music and sat at the bar (highly recommended as the staff is so friendly). Perfect for a fun night out with great service!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner one night, they had only been open for a week. There wasn't many people in the there when we went, there was one host, and one server/bartender. I liked that it was a slow night for them when we went, our server was very attentive, and was able to talk to us about the restaurant and the menu, the owner was able to come out an talk with us and tell us some information about himself and the other owner and why they opened. You don't get to be able to find out the background or speak with an owner at very many places. 
the inside was really cute and different from any other place I have been. it nice and spacious inside Their menu is a little small, but good choices they have a little bit of everything. We had the muenster cheese fondue with chorizo and pretzels which were good, the chorizo gave the cheese dip a little kick to it. My husband had got the The Rogue Burger, it was a good size burger, lots of flavor, it came with string fries which were delicious. I had got the BBQ Pork Flatbread and it was delicious. We were very satisfied with our options. I also the how they brought out our water they brought cut up lemon, cucumber and jalapeños to put in our water, I was shocked when they brought the jalapenos to put in the water, but surprisingly I loved the taste of the water with all three in my water.The portions are a good size, the prices are okay, your appetizers prices are just as much as a regular meal. Ive only been once but we will be going back to try something new!!"}
{"text":"We went for Mothers Day, 3 people.  They were not busy which was shocking, news may be spreading that they're failing on different levels.  First off the service is still bad, long waits, forgotten items, this is our second time coming here and I was disappointed in how long everything takes.  

The biggest insult was $6 for half of a flute of a mimosa.  Then when the food was finally brought out they forgot my bacon, and my OJ, cold pancake, etc. 

The food is a 3 out of 5, and getting worse.  And the service is a 1 out of 5.  Whoever is running the front of the store needs to be fired or trained, they are killing this restaurant."}
{"text":"A very lovely Sunday surprise. After my group of five decided we didn't want to go and wait at any of the traditional brunch or breakfast places on a Sunday, we wanted to find a place that would serve breakfast but wasn't labeled breakfast. We called ahead about 45 minutes and made a reservation. Upon arrival had to wait about 5 minutes for the table which is very nice. They have an incredibly nice but brief breakfast brunch menu. This includes everything from burgers to breakfast burritos to eggs Benedict etc. I am not a very foo foo eater and this was a very hearty meal. Bacon could not have been more perfect. 
Not loud at all and we could easily have a conversation even with a packed restaurant.
Overall incredibly pleased and certainly will go back."}
{"text":"My experience here felt like watching a disastrous soft opening for somewhere on bar rescue. 

My family went there for dinner last Friday night, and despite it not being extremely busy, the service was one of the worst I've received. 10 minutes to get a draft beer, a struggle to get attention for even salt and pepper for the table, and 30 minutes ( I kid you not, due to a mistake) to get the bill! Our waitress (Lisa?) was short with us and gave the impression we were a real burden despite our patience with her. She snapped at the hostess who was trying to help bring out our food, and was doing too many things in the restaurant at once to give us anything that would qualify as good service. I understand being short staffed, but at least apologize, or act like you care. 

Food was ok. Mahi tacos had an odd, burnt flavor and served with uncomplimentary rice. Not my favorite. Lasagna was good. My girlfriend got the caprese salad with chicken, and the chicken was a rubbery, inedible frozen chunk. We know it was frozen because when the chef (owner?) came out to check on us i informed him of the inedible chicken. He nodded and said matter of factly that it was a frozen 6 ounce cut thy use so it makes sense, but he'd have to try some. Thanks chef ..... 

They didn't comp the chicken despite it being the only thing left on my girlfriends plate, nor did the waitress even acknowledge it. Overall I'm not sure you could pay for me to go back to this place, and I doubt it has what it takes to stay open long enough for you to do so."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere and food was great.  We split the spinach artichoke dip, wedge salad, and flat bread (meat marina cheese)...the flat bread (pizza like) was wonderful!  I would order that every time.  Several other items looked really yummy too...their fish tacos and burger ordered next to us looked great.  Going to try that next time. Sooo, we ended with the creme brulee and it was OUTSTANDING.  We were too full to try a big dessert (carrot cake with homade frosting and pistachios sounded yummy) but so glad we tried the creme brulee....highly recommend if you like wonderful creme brulee!  So good, so good!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for breakfast. Wonderful service, lovely atmosphere, and delicious huevos. This is a great new more upscale morning option for this neighborhood. I need to come back to try the lemon ricotta pancakes and the crab benedict."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast..lemon pancakes yummy.huveros ranchero. Top billings.great service. Drink Specials nice touch.."}
{"text":"We've eaten here a few times and the food was great both times! We've tried the Classic Burger and Rogue Burger, Strawberry Lemonade Sangria (yum), and Lemon Mascarpone Cheesecake and I'd recommend any of it. We need more local non-chain businesses in Glendale. Has the feel of a cute central Phoenix bistro."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and I have decided its just ok 
Here's why.
Its a nice place when you walk in and the wait staff is attentive. They have really good flavored iced teas. Not too sweet. The appetizers are ok, the best being The crab cakes - they are very good. The pretzels are always a favorite among kids and adults but the chorizo cheese sauce is not good. They definitely need a different recipe. The calamari is meh, and for $11 I would expect fresh not frozen and served with hot marinara not a cold red dipping sauce with tartar sauce. The burgers are good and the veggie burger is good to. I've had pasta there several times and I don't understand how a restaurant can serve really mushy pasta. That's something they're very consistent on. Whether its a side of an entree' or a pasta dish right down to the kids pasta it all tastes like it was pre-cooked days ago and then cooked again to death. The salads are good the pork soup is tastey with nice chunks of meat. The chili was very salty. Another thing I always get to do is call a waiter over to clear the table of dishes after they ask how's everything? and then walk away. I literally have to hand empty plates to the waiters because they just leave them on the table. This is not once. every time we've been there this has happened (4 times this year). I have to say they have a really nice bathroom and it's clean. (I cannot say that about other restaurants). it's competitively priced. Maybe that's why I'm being so critical. But, when I walk out after $100 meal for 5  scratching my head thinking; this place is a 5 out of 10 at best, and there are so many places to try. The burgers and salads are good but if and when we go back I'll stick with those options."}
{"text":"I went to The Rogue Tomato about a week ago and had a server my the name of Natalie. She was such a sweetheart and even though she might have not known every thing on the menu, she was positive and found out the answer to all of my questions. 

I love the atmosphere and the ambiance that this restaurant has put together. And the design of the bar for me was to die for. 

The food was unbelievably delicious. I had ordered the Pecan Smoked Chicken and it was marvelous. Chicken was very juicy and the flavors were there. My brother whom I was having dinner with ordered The Rogue Burger and he said it was the best Burger he has ever had. We of course had to order dessert, I ordered the chocolate flour less torte (very chocolatey and very good) and my brother ordering the crème brulee both desserts very delicious. 

I loved the fact that the owners table touched every table to ask how their dining experience was. That sealed the deal for me loving this restaurant.

If you love a hipster vibe and delicious food with what seems to be an amazing staff, definitely stop by!"}
{"text":"Looking for authentic food with a relaxing atmosphere? Look no further! I've been here for dinner and brunch and fell in love! Their food is so simple yet full of flavor. Definitely check them out!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here. We were promptly seated and got our drinks shortly after. I ordered the classic Rueben. The sandwich was warm and the the meat ratio to bread was right on. But what made the sandwich was the homemade thousand island dressing. Was so awesome and had a salad also. 1 suggestion if you order a salad with a sandwich put salad in bowl so salad dressing doesn't run on sandwich. But overall service and food were awesome."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times for lunch and the food is pretty good. I usually sit in the restaurant area and the service is a little slow but very friendly. I sat at the bar today and service was great I had their shrimp tacos and they are always very good. They have a great atmosphere and the place is always clean. Only bad thing is they charged me for a club soda! I was pretty surprised it was a first."}
{"text":"Cute quaint place with great food and nice staff. Music every Saturday night! Tacos are legit and good fillings! Definitely a nice break from the typical chain restaurant and scottsdale scene!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Kids friendly, we had a little mixup with our order the Manager came right away and fixed our order you can see they are working as a team. We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch and ordered an appetizer and an entree. It was a good amount considering my boyfriend and I weren't too hungry.

Total for both dishes about ~$21 before tip.

BBQ Pork Sliders (~$11): Comes with 3 small sliders. Pulled pork is nicely seasoned with bbq sauce, yummy. Comes with shoestring fries, nice and crispy!

Blue Corn Crab Cake (~$8): Comes with 1 crab cake about the size of my palm. Comes with a tasty tarter sauce with corn pieces in it. Great taste!

Overall, I really liked the decor, service, and food. I would definitely recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Was so happy to discover this little gem. Outstanding menu with interesting breakfast choices. It was next to impossible to decide what to get so we did the next best thing and got multiple items and shared! Everything was awesome. Great breakfast adult drinks as well!! Bloody Mary please!!!"}
{"text":"Have been back several times since the first review in June and both the food and service have been consistently good.  Great happy bar menu with servings that work for a meal."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review after my second visit the other day.  My first visit I didn't really eat a full meal and I wanted to wait until I had a real meal to contemplate my experience.

Both visits were good.  My most recent one was for lunch and while the food was very good, I wish they had a more affordable lunch menu.  There was some service mishaps that prevented me from rating it the perfect 5 stars but I felt the food and the overall good service warranted a 4.

I ordered the Rogue burger and I didn't know they offered a Build Your Own Burger deal until after I ordered when one of the servers came by with flyers.  Like, wow - this would be something I would've done instead and something that should've been talked about right after being seated.  The Rogue burger was 14.50 and the BYO was 10.  I would've loved to save a little bit of money and eaten a burger I would've LOVED instead of just liked.

The burger was huge and I was not able to finish my meal.  Hubby had to step outside for a couple of minutes and I felt a sudden urge of sickness.  I don't believe it was food related but rather a small illness I was dealing with at the time.  Anyhoo, I went to the bar were my server and 2 others were and told them I needed to use the restroom but I wanted to take my leftovers home.  They all acknowledged me and I rushed to their restroom.

The ladies' room was clean but the regular stall has a broken lock.  The door thankfully stays shut without the lock and I was the only one there the entire time.  I'm not fond of their above-the-counter sink bowls as I found keeping all of the water inside while washing my hands was very difficult with where the faucet was.  It was just poorly designed in my opinion.

I must've been gone 10 minutes and my table has been completed bussed.  I was trying to find my server and a different one approaches me as I came out of the restroom to apologize for clearing my food and that she wanted to make a new full order for me to take home.  I wasn't even mad; I was just sad that I told 3 people that I was coming back and no one saved my leftovers.  I was still stuffed at that point and I felt that making a new order was excessive as I already finished 90% of my meal.  I pretty much said, thanks for being so generous but I'll pass this time.  My original server came back shortly after and again apologized for the mishap.  She took off my iced tea from the bill and gave me a new one to take home.  Again, I wasn't mad but appreciated the gesture.  And I wasn't looking for any compensation either.

I would love come back to try different stuff on the menu.  And now that I'm aware of the BYO burger, I'll make sure to ask for it next time."}
{"text":"Came here at lunchtime and sat at the bar. All the booths were occupied, which was a good sign. We were greeted right away and ordered drinks and looked over the menu. Husband had the Cuban sandwich, which he loved, especially the bread. He always says \"the bread makes the sandwich\". I had the mahi-mahi tacos. The amount of fish was not reflective of the high price and the fish was not crunchy, but, on the chewy side. They need twice the amount of fish per taco to reflect the high price. They have other things that looked interesting on the menu, but, for the price not sure I will return. Two drinks, sandwich and tacos and the bill was $40.00."}
{"text":"This review is based on the value I got today. The taste was great the homemade noodles were good flavor and stroganoff sauce was perfect. But for $18 I should have had more meat. There was 3 small measly pieces size of a quarter, I left hungry. It was all long hefty strips of mushroom I mean over 50% of the dish was mushrooms. I didn't drink my soda after I ate my noodles and I didn't want to slurp up soda. Anyhow the whole soda was there it was $20+ down the drain"}
{"text":"We recently ate at the Rogue Tomato and found the establishment to be excellent. My wife had the signature Rogue burger and I had the classic Rueben panini. Both were prepared perfectly and were plentiful, overall, we were very pleased with our choices. To top off our main meal we had the chocolate flourless torte for desert, OUTSTANDING! We had great service from John our bartender/server and he made us feel extremely welcome for our first visit by helping us navigate the menu and select our entrees. We will return in the future to try other entrees and enjoy another relaxing evening."}
{"text":"I had brunch here with some friends and I absolutely love this place! The menu is very interesting and diverse, their drinks were good, and the employees were very friendly. I will definitely be back here in the future!"}
{"text":"Wow!! The food was amazing!!! Great selection, the chicken tortilla soup was amazing. Burgers are super delicious.  I love the shoestring fries. Our waitress was delightful.  I wish I had Room for dessert.  I can't wait to go back and try something different."}
{"text":"Great place for weekend breakfast. Higher end entrees, not just eggs and pancakes but Eggs Benedict or lemon ricotta or blueberry pancakes.Sunday's they do a brunch ( breakfast and lunch menu items)."}
{"text":"4 stars here's the reason: our appetizer came out before our drinks.  This was a hot appetizer by the way, something that needed to be cooked, and we ordered beer, not a mixed drink. The food and beers were awesome! Just come prepared for really, really slow service."}
{"text":"Went there with hubby on St. Patrick's evening for dinner because we didn't want the \"green beer drowning\". The hostess was new and nice, the waitress was nice. It's hard to say anything more about them because they were overshadowed by Grandma's menu with a spicy spiff. 

If you want peppers or spiciness in damned near everything in various forms with different levels of heat (picante) then this is your place. Green chiles, chimichurri (close enough), salsa verde (green), zesty shrimp, stuffed poblano pepper, curry potato mash with Salmon (blech!), zesty this and spicy that in.every.dish. I don't know if the Jack Daniels BBQ sauce is zesty but you might assume since the ginger pistachio risotto might have a kick of heat from the ginger. No peppers in the veggie lasagna!!! Also, the fondue appetizer with chorizo that you would expect would be spicy was not and the cheese fondue was grainy and cold!

Sorry to have spent $50. I like highly flavored foods but trying to \"influence\" burgers, steaks, salmon and pork with only spicyness is a mistake. Not to mention that it is an allergic nightmare for anyone with a nightshade allergy.

For a run of the mill menu that's tasty and done well I'd go north on 50th Ave to Dillons. Better salads too."}
{"text":"Probably one of the better options for brunch/lunch in this area (north glendale). The service can be slow (although friendly), and wait for food has been pretty long most times that I've been here, but the food hasn't disappointed. Sometimes there is live music on the weekends as well, and they have a nice outdoor patio to sit in (especially now that the mornings are finally getting a bit cooler!). Would recommend if you are local to the area and not looking to drive very far to get some good food"}
{"text":"Had the beer smash and moonshine punch and they are delicious. Awesome folks that work here and beautiful place overall. Next time hope to try the food. We r watching a live blue grass being played and they have flamenco and Brazilian guitarist coming."}
{"text":"Great find can't wait to come back for brunch . The breakfast options look fantastic with live acoustic and other music. There is an option to call ahead to reserve a place here as I hear it gets busy.  Lunch was great service perfect .. would like to see more local IPA options but what they have is good .  Again the atmosphere is real cafe micro pubish yea I made that up !"}
{"text":"We were very excited to try rogue tomato and took our 2 kids, 3 and 20 months, with us on a Friday night. We were seated fairly quickly which we thought was great for a Friday evening. However our server seemed very annoyed at our questions about the menu and wasn't very helpful. After placing our order we waited about 30 minutes (normal) for our food. They brought the wrong kids meal for our 20 month old and our server quickly took it away (chicken fingers) and said she'd immediately bring him his pizza. Well we waited over 40 minutes, on top of the 30 original minutes, for them to bring my baby his food. Luckily I had some snacks in my purse and he ate the fries from my order but I found it absolutely ridiculous they couldn't bring a teeny pizza to a baby. We all finished our food when they finally brought the check at the same time they brought his pizza. Needless to say we were very frustrated. Server never apologized and just said \"we took off his pizza from your order\" (3 bucks). Our food was lacking in flavor and was nothing special. We definitely will not be returning."}
{"text":"Steve is an awesome bartender, and we really enjoyed his service along with his affability on life and experience. As for the food, the stuffed pablano was one of the more flavorful dishes you'll order around town. This place isn't loud at all, so it makes for a great first date or as a place you'd love to catch up with friends. Terrific experience all around!"}
{"text":"We have been here twice, once at lunch and another dinner and both times were not very pleased. The cheese that comes with the pretzel appetizer tasted like rotten milk. Nothing really flavorful in my burger. The carrot cake dessert wasn't moist. Server filled our water once and only the bar had people"}
{"text":"Unfortunately this place has really gone down hill in the last 2 months. This is an untouched piece of their dessert . It tastes just as well as it looks. I'm bummed; I used to really love this place."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. We participated in burger night. My only gripe is that the bartender ignored us because her friends came in and were sitting at the bar. It was unprofessional to see them gossiping and carrying on with their friends right next to us while we were trying to have a nice night"}
{"text":"Ahhhhhhmazing! Super cute place! Great food! Downtown phx vibes but on the west side!"}
{"text":"Very cute and modern farm house style restaurant. Service was great, food was good, but very pricey. Breakfast for 2 was $33.00. Average portions, my eggs Benedict had very thin slices of Canadian bacon. The other breakfast omelette was very small but good. The jam they served with the toast was great. Going back to Peoria cafe next time!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! Finally a great non chain, non corporate eatery with truly wonderfully chef prepared food!! Great prices and so many great choices! Friendly and great service! So far I've liked everything I've had. Mahi tacos are sooo good and lemon chicken pasta to die for!! Salads are all good also and crab cakes delightful!"}
{"text":"Why I've never been here since it's opened is beyond me! The food tastes upscale and made from scratch, like restaurant food should be! Their use of spices is spot on, something other restaurants tend to lack! The staff was friendly and attentive. I will be back and recommending to others!"}
{"text":"I intended on sending this last week however, found my previous Yelp account had been hacked so here I am all brand new again. This place was a drive-by find and so glad I  did. Best burger I have had in quite some time (I'm  picky  about a burger), the ambience is quite simple and the detailes on the walls with such precision. Service, cheery and friendly. Found out they also have live music on some nights and were encouraged to make reservations for those evenings (sounds as though they can really pack a room)."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I wanted to try something new so we ventured out and tried The Rogue Tomato . I found this restaurant on Yelp and had a good rating so we wanted to give it a shot.

Good and friendly service overall, beautiful characteristics inside and good location. Why the 3 stars you ask?! A few reasons but I think they could get it right or maybe it was an off day for them...

We had the soft pretzel and chorizo dip which was good; however the bowl with chorizo was way too big. They need to use half the size of the bowl they use because there was an absurd amount of dip left over and we felt bad about wasting it. 

For my entree, I had the meatloaf dinner that came with mashed potatoes and carrots.  The portion size was perfect, but the meatloaf came out a little burnt to the point it was crunchy almost every bite. It didn't have much flavor and that also goes for the mashed potatoes. It needed more flavor in both for sure. 

My fiancé had the soup and asparagus appetizer and she also felt that the asparagus appetizer was missing flavor. I agreed as I tried it also. 

At the end of the night we both left there saying we weren't impressed with the food but that the ambience, location and character this place has is good and could really thrive. It just needs a bit of a makeover on the items we tasted. Not worth a $60 dinner In our opinion. I don't believe they deserve anything less than 3 stars because again, the service, atmosphere, ambience, and potential is there and was good.

Better yet, What this place really should consider focusing on a breakfast and brunch spot. If they could go that route in this location I feel they would do great. They already have everything there (character, layout, location, etc) just get a solid brunch  menu and breakfast selection, champagne, mimosas, bloody Mary's and other typical brunch items maybe a local musician to play and go that route. It could really get a great crowd since not much is around there.

Maybe we'll give it a shot again in a few months or so and if so, I'll be sure to update my review.

I really do feel that this place has potential, just didn't live up to what we were hoping and expecting with our experience."}
{"text":"This place has a nice ambiance, a good Sunday brunch, a good Sunday brunch singer, and good tequila."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today and was blown away!  Inside the restaurant is open and nice, looks like there is plenty of room and everything is really clean. Service was great. The food was Amazing!  We had Mahi tacos and a lunch combo with Chili Verde soup and the chicken panini. Then finished with carrot cake for desert. I would recommend any of them,  it was all incredibly fresh and tasty!  This is an awesome place, I will return often."}
{"text":"Had the carnitas tacos...2 of the 3 tortillas were burned.  Carnitas was OK but I make better at home. Hubby had the Rogue Burger and said it was good....but it should be for $12.95.
Wont be back."}
{"text":"Just got back from Sunday Brunch and this place is hands down the best in the West Valley! Food is amazing and the ambience makes it a special place for brunch. I had the Rogue Chilaquiles and it was amazing! The pork was juicy and the eggs cooked perfectly. Great selections in their menu, I can't wait to go back again. Live music in the background, not too loud so you can hear each other talk, just right! Definitely 5 Stars! A must try! Thx for the recommendation @ontheroadeats"}
{"text":"I have been here about 6 times now.  The first time was when they first opened and thought the service was a little rough, the food was great.  I was hosting a business happy hour and we had several appetizers and a couple of their flatbreads.  Everything was really good.  The other times we have been there have provided equally awesome food.  The service is a little hit or miss, never bad, but slow at times and not consistent.  The food is good enough that it has not stopped us from returning but they need to work on their flow."}
{"text":"Oh yum--we just had lunch in this 3-week old restaurant and we are smitten! The ambiance is upscale modern, the menu appealing with wide range of lunch items. Hubby had the kale & bean soup with portabella & hummus panini; I had the Mexican soup and their version of a BLT (thick bacon, fried green tomato & arugula). All delicious & served with French fries nicely touched with truffle oil. We will definitely be back with friends in tow."}
{"text":"The food, service, specialty drinks and atmosphere was divine. I will be back soon! Way to go Westside for something original"}
{"text":"First time here..Great experience! Nice atmosphere! Delicious made-from-scratch food..service was exceptional! Italian bread was best I've ever had! I would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Thought I would try this place so we ordered two fish mahi-mahi tacos to go at $14 something apiece what a rip-off!!!! Got home and found one tiny fried piece of fish in each taco. About the size of a French fry. The rice that came with it was tasty but \"get real\" this shouldn't have cost more than 6-7 bucks! Don't waste your money on this place."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Loved the food! Excellent service! The decor is pretty cool. They have excellent selections for me and my husband, whom is vegetarian. I will definitely come back and try something different."}
{"text":"We went Saturday night for dinner about 7pm. Place was pretty full and there was live music. We received warm bread right away. We ordered the Spinach and artichoke dip, it was pretty good. We also ordered the Poblano pepper and beef tip entree. It was awesome! Good food, good service, great environment. The live music was nice people got up and danced very fun! We'll be back."}
{"text":"Very nice place for brunch . LITTLE PRICY . 
Beautiful Decor and service with a smile . Waiters are really nice and suggest great options for  vegetarians . 
My husband has Breakfast Burritos, I had egg white omelet with spinach and Mushroom came with potatoes and toast . 
My son has Waffles with berries. The syrup was regular . Could have real maple syrup. Nothing to write home about . 
Coffee was really good with some unique blends . 
The owners really took time in designing the place. 
Menus could be better with some NEW AGE TOUCH . 

Wish the food had more flavor with more spices and better salsa ."}
{"text":"The food was good, but the service was TERRIBLE! The restaurant was about 3/4 full. Once we were seated it took over 5 minutes to get our drink order. It was longer than usual to take our food order. We asked for more bread which never came. Once our food came we had to go up to the bar to get our own lemonade refills. When we were finished, our bill came right away but we had to walk it to the bar to actually pay. 

Throughout the evening we could see our waitress talking and laughing with friends. We tried to get her attention but she never looked our way. 

It's a great place that I'd like to try again but with a different waitress."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar this evening an Carina was our bartender.  EXCELLENT service, very attentive an she knew her drinks an the menu.  We decided on the Friday. $50 special, bottle of wine an 2 entree's with salad.  It was fantastic can't wait till next Friday.  Great place!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing!! My boyfriend and I came here for the first time and this place did not disappoint. Atmosphere was very chic and inviting. Our waitress was super friendly and awesome except for a little \"whoops\" on my order which she fixed promptly. The food and drinks were nothing short of amazing. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"This place was very good and one of the best burgers I have ever had. If you go after 5 they give you bread with oil to start with which is a nice treat. Good atmosphere for a date night but the food will get you coming back. Lemon chicken pasta is also very very good. And they have Tank 7 on draft for all the KC people in PHX."}
{"text":"This has turned into our favorite neighborhood spot for a nice dinner or a quick tasty lunch. Great music venue on weekends, refreshing beverage menu. Always happy to go in and see what's cooking."}
{"text":"Amazing food, excellent service and great atmosphere!!! My new favorite place!!! It's great to have a local, non-chain restaurant that employs only trained chefs!!! Pretty awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Food? Amazing! The presentation was reflective of the quality of what we ordered. The crab eggs benni tasted like I was sitting on the beach with the sound of waves crashing... amazing. Service? Also amazing! Tara made us feel like we've been friends for years. Those friends that don't talk all the time but can pick up where we left off."}
{"text":"My 1st time here, yum!! My husband and I shared a house salad, big and yummy. I had the shrimp tacos, so good and he had the carnitas tacos, also amazing. We will be back!"}
{"text":"The service was a tad on the slow side. But the real disappointment was the fact that the guacamole looked and tasted pre-made. Also the chicken on the Southwest chicken salad also seemed pre-made or from frozen. The decor was very nice and felt modern but the food didn't live up to that standard. The salad was the best part of the meal and if I only wanted a salad I would consider going back."}
{"text":"Truly a bright spot in the middle of bland. Come try this place. Good atmosphere. Good people and good food. We had \"The Rogue Burger\" and it was quite tasty!"}
{"text":"Tried many of the appetizers. .. delish!  Crab cakes are next with the hubby, for date night."}
{"text":"This is actually my third time here but I'm just getting around to posting a review. It is my new favorite local spot. There are so few non-chain options in northwest Phoenix, so Rogue Tomato is like a diamond in the rough. The service is friendly but not overbearing. The drinks are unique - I definitely recommend the El Inferno margarita. Decent happy hour. Best of all the food is amazing. Very fresh and hearty portions. It is somewhat quiet here on a week night but every table is full on the weekends. They also serve breakfast which I hope to try soon."}
{"text":"I was told they were understaffed in the kitchen but after waiting 20min to be greeted by my server when I already knew what I wanted before I sat down and after waiting 1 hour and 20 more minutes to get my food I was pretty turned off the place. I ordered with the woman who seated me then went over my order with her and my server then went over it again with just my server and STILL the omelette came out wrong. I ate it anyway cause I'm not waiting another hour for it to come back out. It was horrible they basically cooked eggs and slapped a spoonful of soggy sad spinach in the middle of it and called it an omelette, no seasoning no cheese (as it said it came with on the menu) nothing, just plain eggs and plain spinach. 
They told me the pancakes were a \"good size\" I still ordered a side of 3 even tho the side comes with 2 and they were \"dollar\" sized pancakes. 3-4\" diameter. I basically ordered two meals and it still wasn't enough food to fill a person.
Aside from the ambiance and decor which I loved, this place was horrible."}
{"text":"I could, should say more but let spectacular suffice. We'd been here for brunch twice and decided to take the plunge for dinner. Laid back atmosphere, great live music and the food ... the roasted stuffed poblano is legit, the pork chili verde is great and the lemon pasta and lemon cheesecake are to die for."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a great late lunch here yesterday .. We arrived around 2:00 Sunday afternoon , warmly greeted and seated immediately.. The restaurant was 1/3 full, a couple tables occupied outside as well as a few tables inside.. Sat about 10 minutes before a friendly waitress and took our drink and recommended appetizers .. We started with a delicious cheese and chorizo fondue served with warm pretzel bread.. Our family ordered a variety of food, Sonoran Quesadilla, Pork Chile Verde and a Jack Daniels Burger..The food is large portions, great prices and every bite was amazing .. My only complaint was the very slow service .. Although our waitress was very friendly and knowledgable, she may need a little more practice  in multi tasking .. Our drinks were empty for a while several times, we would have to ask for a refill.. She would then take one glass at a time to the bar to refill our soda instead of being aware that we are low on our drinks and bringing fresh beverages to the table and remove the old ones..Restaurant is decorated beautifully along with a welcoming bar.. Will definitely return for dinner again soon.. I am sure with a little bit more training, the staff will shine!!"}
{"text":"I arrived here at 10:30am during breakfast hour. After reading reviews on the fish taco, I decided to wait till 11 to get the fish taco on lunch menu. The waiter was very nice.  At 11:15, he started telling me my lunch is coming out soon.  At 11:30, after seeing other people getting their lunch, I questioned the waiter what was wrong.  He came back and said sorry and was going to take half off my order.  Then 11:45am, I finally got my fish tacos and cilantro rice. 

I figured, if it's good then it's worth the wait.  However,  the fish were soggy and the flavor was blend.  The cilantro rice was sticky and soggy too.  I could not even taste the cilantro.  Total disappointment, especially after the long wait

I had high expectation, so maybe I felt more disappointed than I would have.   

I like the atmosphere and was going to come back for happy hour.  Maybe I will try another place now."}
{"text":"My husband and I are going somewhere New every time we go out. ! It's been a lot of fun and we get to see the city!! Tonight we went the The Rogue!! Wonderful. Wonderful. Wonderful!  Food was great. We both had flatbreads. We both had never had one. Isn't that odd!!  I had the pesto chicken and my husband had the the meat one. The atmosphere was great. Oddly enough my favorite part was when I looked up and saw an old classic movie playing. What a nice change of pace. No noisy sports to interrupt. Beautiful music playing in the background. Very classy!!  I don't give 4 stars ever!! This one. 4. No one gets a 5 unless, we'll who knows what lies ahead!"}
{"text":"Went with a date on Saturday night. They were very crowded but could not bend over backwards to make sure that we got a good table where we were able to enjoy each other's company. It felt like the staff were friends with some of the best service of any restaurant i had ever been, and I have dined all over the world. I haven't even mentioned the food yet but it was fantastic. This is the place to go if you live in Glendale, like great food and exceptional service. 
Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"The food was great and so was the service! I can see this being our new girls hangout!"}
{"text":"Just discovered The Rogue Tomato and I'm completely wowed.  Jennifer was an outstanding server, congenial and attentive, and Chef prepared unique and delightful dishes. Our party had the Stuffed Poblano, the St. Louis Ribs, and the Rogue Burger. Also had the Rogue Burger \"protein style\" (served on lettuce with a side salad vs a bun and fries). All were delectable! They also have a full bar, and Happy Hour specials.  My favorites are the Stuffed Poblano and Cream Brûlée for dessert. This is a Must Visit place for all tastes when in Glendale. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Nice place for dinner.  I like the decor of the place.  Meatloaf was awesome and I would get it again.  We also had the carrot cake for desert, it was a huge piece and was good to share. You should go check it out! Much better than any of the chains in the area."}
{"text":"My new favorite lunch spot.  Had the soup and salad combo complete with a perfect number of Fries!! I will definitely be coming back for dinner, you are just what this neighborhood needed!! Hip place, with great food and beer selection!"}
{"text":"Colleen was a fantastic server and personable!  Food was outstanding!  Will come back the next time I am in town!"}
{"text":"Lets talk about delicious food and awesome service! I believe I went the day after I opened and it surprised me how amazing it was. 
I got a burger, for app I got chips a guacamole  I almost died it was so good! Lol
Can't remember what my husband got, not that I had enough room in my stomach to even try his food, but he was also a happy camper.
I'll definitely go here again!"}
{"text":"I had the prickly pear margarita and it was perfect  bruschetta was different but very tasty!! Love this cute little place."}
{"text":"This place has some really good food. I have been in the restaurant business for about 20 years as a chef in the valley. I will say that it is nice to see some chefs on this side of town that open up a place and have really good food. Need a little help with the service but this is my second time here and will be back again. Give these place a try if you in the restaurant business you will like it."}
{"text":"Southwest chicken sandwich was excellent! Menu is limited for lunch, I guess they are trying to keep it simple. Service a little slow, had to wait 15 min for sweetener for ice tea."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant yesterday for Mother's Day and have to say that we were not impressed one bit. We arrived shortly after the Mother's Day brunch ended and at that point the place was pretty empty. We made reservations a week prior but upon arrival they told us that our name was nowhere to be found in their reservations. It didn't really bother us at that point due to the fact that it wasn't busy but it was still surprising to hear! So we decide to sit outside and again the outdoor seating was empty. There were 4 adults and 3 children in our party. After receiving the menu my husband decided to order the calamari as well as the artichoke and spinach dip for everyone to share. The calamari came with two dipping sauces and was pretty good. The artichoke dip came with about 5 slim toasted bread slices. I'm sorry, but I couldn't even call it a dip. It was basically a smear of artichoke and spinach on a small plate. I think all 4 of the adults only had a few bites because that's all that it served. So that was disappointing! After that, we all decided on our entrees. My sister in law and my husband ordered the Mahi Mahi tacos, I had the shrimp tacos, and my mom had some chicken with what looked like some rice pilaf. We were all so disappointed with our food! All of the tacos were served with guacamole smeared on soggy corn tortillas which it didn't mention in the description. It mentioned salsa Verde which was nowhere to be found unless that's what they're calling the guacamole. If that's the case, they have that wrong.  And because my sister in law hates avocado, she had to have her tacos remade for her. The tacos came with a small side of cilantro rice which sounded good on the menu but was actually terribly crunchy as if it wasn't cooked entirely. The corn in the rice also threw me off because that was also not mentioned in the description on the menu. I attempted to try it but it was so terrible. The shrimp itself had good flavor and was prepared well. I tried one of my husband's fish tacos and it was soggy with a bland flavor. If the fish is supposed to have been fried in a batter, that's not how came out at all. My mom said her chicken was also extremely dry. My daughter's cheeseburger came out looking like it came from a cafeteria. My son ordered chicken fingers and they looked like they came out of the frozen food section. Yuck! Our service was also extremely slow which didn't make sense since the place was pretty much cleared out. We decided to try some dessert and to our surprise this part was pretty tasty! We had the lemon cheesecake and creme brulee. All in all, this place only had dessert going for them. We were highly dissapointed with rest of our meal. I'm sad so say that we won't be back! My mom and I had been here once on two different occasions and had really good experiences with excellent food but this time around threw us in the complete opposite direction. This was the first time for the rest of our family and they all had a look of dissapointment on their faces as they tried their food. We really wanted to like this place but based on our current experience we will be writing this restaurant off on our list of places to eat. Maybe we got the short end of the stick after their brunch rush but it still doesn't make it right to slack on the rest of the meals that they serve."}
{"text":"Good food and good service. I had a breakfast with rosemary potatoes and sausage. Excellent local sausage. Nice atmosphere and the French toast amazing!"}
{"text":"I TESTIFY!!!!!  Amanda up at the bar just served me up the BEST margarita I've ever had in my life!  And I've had many in all my years :)
Ask for the \"inferno\" margarita. It's bomb. On point! You can taste the cucumber, the jalapeños oh so subtly but there's that nice smooth sweetness that comes thru all in one, omg DELISH!  I'll have another!"}
{"text":"This is my second visit in two days! Why did I not know about this place? Lunch yesterday was the Pork Chili Verde and it was amazing! This morning's breakfast was Lemon Ricotta Pancakes. I can't say enough about how tasty they are! I can't wait to try dinner and live music on the weekends! This place is a keeper! 
UPDATE: The crew at Rogue Tomato continue to bring their A game. We are now Sunday morning regulars and tried dinner this week. Ginger Margarita? Yes, please! Also-Tara is a wonderful server! Request her section and you'll see what I'm talking about!"}
{"text":"Food here is really good, no complaints. Always wind up here for Sunday brunch. Haven't had lunch or dinner yet. So far, everyone in the family always likes everything they've tried. Service is on point. Inside is trendy with a hipster vibe- chalkboard writing on the walls. I'll return because they have good food with great service."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place after having an appointment in Glendale and what a lucky find it was! Had the Rogue burger and fish tacos. Both were excellent, so many layers of flavor in each dish! The atmosphere is great and service was perfect. We will be taking a drive to Gendale more often to check out the rest of the menu! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed! The reviews are promising and the food sounded great but alas....we did not get to find out. Came in for breakfast, restaurant was not terribly busy, about 10 tables or so and 3 or 4 waitresses. Took a bit for our drink order to be taken and then a bit more for our food order. Two tables that came in after us and ordered after us, received their food and were happily eating before we ever saw our food. Our waitress seemed disinterested in giving us an update on our food so we waited about 15 minutes more and still no food. We ended up leaving.....I wonder if our food ever got made? Regardless, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Fun place, no wait time!  a little low on the orange juice in the mimosa but the pineapple Moscow mule was great!"}
{"text":"Thank u Diann for recommending your brothers restaurant it was great. We sat on the patio & had a great Sunday brunch. Food was excellent & fresh. We all loved the thin cut fries. This is a hidden gem on 59th.Ave & Union Hills. We will make this restaurant one of our regular stops when visiting the Peoria/Glendale area."}
{"text":"Found a great new spot in the west valley.  The Rogue Tomato has a great look and exceptional food!  One of the best things on the menu was the Rogue burger.  The appetizers are unique and delicious and the menu has a choice of delicious choices for all palettes. 

I'll be be back very soon!"}
{"text":"So I went here tonight after reading some reviews.  It is always hard to sell a new place to my husband, he is super picky.  We went and there was a nice ambience as you enter. We got menus right away. Getting water and drinks took a little longer. There were only 4 groups there with one being a larger group. The service was a little slow but they treated us nicely.  

We will start with the appetizer. Muenster cheese and chorizo fondu with 4 mini loaves of pretzel bread with a squirt of spicy mustard in one corner.  We all loved it and my husband kept getting more even after the pretzel bread ran out.

We then went into dinner. The daughter had the spinach, kale, & quinoa salad. She ate it up and enjoyed it, I tried it and liked it.  The husband had the wedge with steak and actually used the word good when describing it.  I had the Sonoran filet with asparagus, fingerling potatoes, portobello mushrooms with a chili coulis. Every bite was delicious. Everyone had a bite and loved the flavor in the chili coulis.

It was a little pricey but the food was good and the husband said we should go back. This is high praise from him."}
{"text":"First time visit today for breakfast. Service was excellent and the food was great. Prices very reasonable. Our party had waffles, french toast and I had huevos rancheros. Everyone loved the food.  We have found a new place and will definately return. Next time for dinner."}
{"text":"I was questioning why we were driving so far for tacos; then I found out it was well worth the drive.  The Tuesday Tacos were wonderful!  Even though I'm not addicted to chocolate, I must say I tried the chocolate flourless torte and it was very good.  I liked it.  It was slow getting the bill, but while dining, people did check to see if the food was good."}
{"text":"I adored my visit here. Everything was just so spot on. I wrestled back and fourth between a four and a five star review. Yelp does not give half stars and I rarely give five. ( I wish they would give half stars) so I decided to vote up due to my server Austin and the wonderful service I had for lunch today. The staff made me feel like I was a guest in their home. 

I love the eclectic, feel to the place. The brick walls give me a Chitown/NY bistro feel to the place. All the food was absolutely delicious! I had the Crab cakes, lunch special with the Kale  and quinoa mini salad and Portabella Panini. I was surprised I actually liked their shoe string fries which I rarely enjoy. (Aioli chili oil, yum!) I also ordered a cup of coffee based on the reviews and yes it is good. I also liked the Mango Ice tea for once. It was not too syrupy sweet and gross like at other places. I did not have dessert but that pistachio ginger, carrot cake has my name written all over it for next time. 

I can't wait to go back. Oh yeah, did I mention they have activities? Flamenco and Jazz guitar and Paint Nights? Waaaaaaaaa???? Yup, many returns predicted."}
{"text":"Came in for breakfast and had to wait ten minutes for a waitress gave her out drink order which was coffee and orange juice and then has to wait another ten minutes
and they only served the orange juice. When I asked the w"}
{"text":"My wife and I rarely go outside the box. By chance, we found this place while looking for a Quiznos. We've had brunch and dinner and both times the food has been overwhelmingly good. Service is also top notch and we will always go out of our way to eat here. Stop supporting the chains and try a place that serves food they actually stand behind."}
