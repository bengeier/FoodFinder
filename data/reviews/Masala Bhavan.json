{"text":"What a great find ... authentic S Indian cooking in  SW Calgary. We loved the dosas, and we know a good dosa when we see one. A pleasant surprise, esp the discounted price on Friday nights. 

We had the masala dosa and the plain \"paper\" dosa which were perfectly thin and crispy. The condiments were tasty too. 

The fish curry was tasty but a bit spicy for me. The mango saffron rasmalai was yummy and the chai very good too.

We will be back often!"}
{"text":"Very great Indian food. The price was good and the portions were large. 

Highly recommend the fish pakora, they were very good, fresh and tasty. Also enjoyed the Chinese fried rice. Great service as well. We'll be going back there again for sure."}
{"text":"I ordered the Chili chicken, Manchurian Cauliflower and Hakka beef noodles. 

The noodles had good flavour but didn't have very much meat and veg, the portion was decent but isn't enough for $11.95

The cauliflower had good flavour but was mush and was a container that weighed less than a pound for $11.95. 

The Chili chicken was by far the most disappointing Chili chicken I've ever had - the flavour was weak and cost $12.95 for a container that weighed JUST over a pound. 

This isn't to say that their food isn't delicious or the dine-in experience isn't great. This review is solely based on the food I ordered for take out. I would still consider checking out the buffet but I think they need to add more to the portions for those prices."}
{"text":"We were their on Friday night with family. Awesome selection of menu' good food and friendly services. We ordered veg samosa, butter chicken, chicken Britain and lamb dosa. The portion was perfect, tastey and we enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I live down the street from the strip mall and have seen at least two restaurants fail at his location so I wasn't all that optimistic that the doors would be open long.  However, they seem to be making a go of it so my friend and I popped in late for some butter chicken, a chick pea curry, some coconut rice and (or course) naan.  I'm not sure what they did to their chicken but it was, by far, the most tender and delicious butter chicken I have yet to try. I think about it every day might take a photo next time I go to put above my bed so it's the last thing I see before falling asleep and first thing I see in the morning. I really am rooting for this place as they seem to have some made skills."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place.  The flavours were very good and complex.  We ordered a couple of dosas which I thought were delicious;  thin and crispy chick pea flour crepe with different fillings.  The butter chicken was very tasty but we only got 6 small pieces of meat in the dish.  Very disappointed with that.   The curry eggplant was very good but a touch to greasy for my liking.  The prices were reasonable but the service was very slow, but at least friendly.  There was only one woman on front end and the restaurant was near full.  Not sure I would go back but definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"You will find great service and food here. We have ordered take out from here multiple times and we have always enjoyed it. We dined in for the first time tonight with some friends and we all really enjoyed it. The garlic naan bread is highly recommended! My favourite was the khorma and butter beef. Glad we also shared lamb Biyani, chicken tikka masala, beef vindaloo and the curried cauliflower dosa as well. Will definitely be coming back next time we carve Indian food."}
{"text":"We are huge fans of the dosa. A dosa was our go-to quick, inexpensive dining out meal when we lived in Vancouver so we are determined to find a good one now that we are in Calgary.  Unfortunately Masala Bhavan is just so-so.

The chutney, sambar and \"pancake\" were all good but the fillings (I had the paneer and my husband had the chicken) were ground to the consistency of dog-food and were indistinguishable from each other.  Added to the filling was way too many peas, and it was not too appetizing. The flavour wasn't bad but the mouth-feel was horrible. 

We love Southern Indian food so maybe we will give their other dishes a try but we will definitely pass on the dosas."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Everything is so fresh. I've been to many Indian restaurants in the city and this is by far the best. Fresh ginger, fresh whole spices, tender chicken! I prefer ordering dishes compared to the buffet. My favourite is chicken curry. I really hope this place does well and stays in business for long time!!"}
{"text":"We have a diet restriction for one of my family members.  No salt at all.  I asked Karthik, the Chef & Owner of Masala Bhavan, if he could prepare dishes I pre-ordered with no salt and he complied.  It was wonderful!  We ordered Vege Pakora, Vege Samosa, Shrimp Biryani, Chicken Biryani and Eggplant Curry.  All these dishes came with raita, also prepared with no salt.   All were done without salt and tasted really, really good!  Karthik was able to enhance the dishes with the different Indian spices to compensate for the lack of salt.  I am so appreciative of restaurant owners like Karthik who can prepare meals for people with diet restrictions.  

Will DEFINITELY be back!!"}
{"text":"Masala Bhavan is just really excellent. It is probably the best South Indian food in Calgary. The South Indian fare is exceptional but all the food here is fresh and tastes great. And, I love their filter coffee. The chef here is awesome and very sweet. The weekend buffets are worth trying but their ala cart menu is a must try."}
{"text":"A very good restaurant and excellent Indian quinine too!

The eggplant curry dish is the best I have had for one with eggplant as the main ingredient.  The nan was very good as well - and served piping hot.  The Chicken Tikka Masala was very tender and had excellent flavor in the sauce.  The third dish we ordered was the Aloo Gobi and it also was an excellent example of well done Indian food.

The prices at this restaurant are very reasonable and the d√©cor is modern and clean.  The service was fairly good, I suspect that they did not expect an almost full house this late on a Sunday when we dined so they might have done a bit better with another person.  The service was very competent, and fortunately we were not in a rush to eat and get somewhere."}
{"text":"Awesome Hakka noodles 
We were visiting Canada and tried this place . Turns out it's not too big but good is really good and they seem pretty busy . Even had food to go for next day !!"}
{"text":"First time here, tried lunch buffet and enjoyed it very much. I personally like butter chicken and the deep fried rings made from beans or lentil. Nann and dosa are good too. Would recommend to others."}
{"text":"Have been there twice. Both times masala dosa and fish curry were great. We also ordered the paneer pakora appetizer. That was terrible. The batter was raw and the paneer inside was cold."}
{"text":"This place is one of the biggest disappointments in the city, everything we ordered was bland, the portions were pathetically small, especially for the price. Really not worth the visit."}
