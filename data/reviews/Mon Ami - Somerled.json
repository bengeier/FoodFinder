{"text":"I go to montreal quite often and come here for a cheap meal.    I always get the whole chicken (no sauce)   very crispy skin and not oily.   The Bibimbap is also very good.    I live in toronto full time and there is a lot of great korean placea to chose from.


This one holds up to them .  I tried other items like the rice cakes  and they were only ok.


They are closed for vacation for a few weeks so check before going there.

{"text":"Came here with my girlfriend to try korean fried chicken for the first time. Juicy and delicious. I also ordered the fried chicken gizzards (which she wouldnt touch) and they were well fried and fun to eat. Big portions. Very cheap lunch specials."}
{"text":"I guess fried chicken is the only way to go at this place. My friend and I tried two of their noodle dishes and both were so disappointing. His was the spicy octopus dish - the octopus was tough and practically inedible. I had the black bean noodles - a gloopy and tasteless mess of a plate. So sad. I really wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"-Really, really good and cheap! (You'll crave it a week after going)

-Enjoyed the fried chicken which comes with a plain coleslaw type salad and ordered seafood pancake for starters. All A+++

-It gets quite busy around 7pm on Saturday so prepare to wait in line or get there earlier.

-Service was nice and polite, not overly friendly which is fine, but there was always a waitress whenever we needed one and that's perfect.

-Atmosphere is very plain but cool Korean music videos play on big screen so that's fun and different! Anyway, it's about the food and company, so NBD

* Bring your own wine/beer - SAQ across street but I think it closes early sometimes. If not, convenience store across street too.."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple of times now- taking food to eat at home. I never associated Korean restaurants and fried chicken, but theirs is amazing- I haven't had such good chicken in years. The meat is high quality, the fry is crisp and not greasy, and the portions are generous. I also had a pork and kim chee stew- it also included mushrooms, tofu, and some vegetables. It was nice and spicy and loaded with ingredients. Definitely a favorite now. I haven't tried the lunch specials but they look good and super cheap. The counter staff have been friendly and helpful (they talked me out of ordering ramen as takeout because they felt the noodles wouldn't hold up). The menu has some more exotic offerings as well- looking forward to trying more. This area of Somerled hasn't had a Korean restaurant - so this is a perfect addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Fried chicken is a big deal at our house us and not all restaurants are created equal. We tried Dawa and found it was overpriced and not even in the same league as Mon ami where I discovered delicious food, friendly helpful and efficient service for take out that was ready to go in 15 minutes. I ordered  the 14 pieces of # 1 fried chicken over the phone for a pick up. We will definitely be back to try the dining experience !"}
{"text":"Oui c'est un peut cher mais c'était vraiment bon. Les tteobeokki étaient à tomber honnêtement et leur kimbab également j'ai vraiment aimé cette cuisine. Bémol le temps d'attente penser à commander à l'avance !"}
{"text":"The fried chicken was almost same taste like Jolibee fried chicken in the Philippines!And their Bibimbap was so good! This place is highly recommended. Order for pick up is okay."}
{"text":"Service is extremely slow. Tables are empty for 15 minutes before anyone starts cleaning while customers wait on the street. The staff takes another 15 minutes before the table is clean. Waiters are standing in the restaurant looking around, walk at turtle pace, look confused. Don't come here unless you are willing to wait."}
{"text":"We ordered for takeout fried chicken, sweet fried chicken, chap chae, and ramen with rice cakes. They do not provide ban chan for takeout so asked for a side of kimchi (3$). Overall the fried chicken and chap chae were delicious! The fried chicken with sweet sauce was ok for me but my fellow diners really liked it. I thought the rice cakes were gummy and the sauce had an unpleasant texture. Kimchi was fresh. Would order again !"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden paradise. Drove from south shore for this and it was worth every kilometers. The fried chicken is the BOMB!!! I'll be back with a vengeance for more !!!

The service is also excellent."}
{"text":"Got a chance to check out fried chicken here and hubby and I slightly prefer this place over Dawa a few blocks away. At first the prices here seemed a bit steep as there aren't many \"single\" size boneless portions that you can get compared with Dawa. So we got a full-chicken sized boneless order ($20) and were surprised at how much bigger the portion here seemed compared with a full-chicken sized order at Dawa. Flavour-wise we also slightly preferred here. But you really can't go wrong with either place. 

Bottom line for me is that if I'm eating solo I would likely go to Dawa so that I can get some boneless chicken for about $12. But if I'm dining as a couple or a group I would recommend this place as there is also a greater variety of dishes in case someone in the group does not want fried chicken. Atmosphere is a little bit nicer here as well..."}
{"text":"Went to the \"6290 Avenue Somerled, Montréal, QC H3X 2B6\" location.

What a pleasant surprise. Definitely wasn't expecting a cafeteria take-out-ish decor, but this does not make the food any less tasty. Like 90% of all Korean restaurants I've been to you have to expect the K-pop music video's playing from a tv in the background, although barely audible.

Tried the Fried chicken as well as the Bulgogi (beef) Bibimbap.
I really enjoyed the chicken, with a wasabi sauce (extra 2$).Crispy on the outside moist on the inside with a slight zing. I'm warning you the whole chicken serving is definitely as advertised, \"One Whole Chicken\". 
The Bulgogi was fine, but I think this had more to do with the fact that I ate all the chicken before I even started on the Bibimbap. Staff were very friendly.

I can't forget to mention the complimentary side dishes. Pickled daikon, cabbage and onions, kimchi cabbage. I'm a big fan of pickled vegetables and I have to say these were very fresh and crispy. I can't be sure they were made in house but they definitely tasted that way,

This a BYOW joint, an SAQ is across the street. If you come after the SAQ closes, there's a CoucheTard at the end of the street."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just discovered this place, and we must say we totally fall in love with it. It's a really small korean restaurant but their food was more than we expected. They give side dishes that were really good and in good amount. We ordered their fried chicken, and it was better than we thought (we've tried Dawa's chicken and we were a bit disappointed). We had their fried mandu and kimchi jiggae. Although, their soup was a bit spicy for me, I really loved the taste. Will come back for it again :]"}
{"text":"Love this one! The food is delicious but the quantity isn't enough! The prices are alright and good services!"}
{"text":"I've come to this location several times. On one occasion over the summer, I ordered multiple dishes with a friend and we were not given any pickled appetizers. When I questioned the waiter about it, he claimed that the pickled appetizers only came with certain dishes. I thought that this was suspicious as everyone in the restaurant was receiving appetizers and there was no indication on the menu which ones came with them. 

So, I decided to follow up months later by telephone to verify whether the appetizers came with all dishes. The woman on the phone confirmed that they did. Yep, I was blatantly lied to.

Is this how you treat paying customers? By lying and disrespecting them?! Shame on you, Mon Ami. Shame on you. I'll make sure to spread the word about your unethical practices."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and that delicious crispy chicken with a hint of heat is just fantastic. So were the Korean ribs. The decor is minimal (this ain't the place for a romantic meal) and the seating was awful. But the food.... was divine!"}
{"text":"I love this place so much! Even it's far away from my home.The fired chicken is super delicious that you cannot image it. And the rice cake is incredible. I must say if you don't want to miss the best fired chicken in Montreal, you should go to try it?"}
{"text":"I tried a ramen dish and kimchi.  They were both excellent.  The owner offered free slices of a Korean radish,which had a lovely sweet flavor.  I think the menu could be narrowed down for the sake of simplicity."}
{"text":"Awesome ! I had fried chicken and pig's feet for dinner with my friends. Those are super , super delicious. Chicken is really crispy and well- seasoned. If you want to try real korean style chicken, you should try  this restaurant. I'm sure that you love it. For pig's feet, well cooked, comes with two kinds of sauce and leek kimchi. The texture is kinda chewy, actually I don't know exactly how I can say that in english. Anyway pig's feet is also really nice as well. Also they serve generous portion I think. Washroom is very clean. That is one of the most important point when I recommend sone restaurant to my friends. Staffs are super friendly and serve kindly their customers. I strongly recommend this place :D"}
{"text":"Best korean place in town. Their chicken, fried or baked, is a must! Other dishes are pretty yummy also, such as the soon dubu jigae or the rice cake skewers. Staff is always friendly and the service is quite fast."}
{"text":"The place is very spacious, but my friends and I sat at the patio since it was an absolutely beautiful day. 

I was told this place has amazing fried chicken! It's a little further away from downtown, but my friend drove a few of our friends here to eat. I ended up ordering pork and kimchi soup. I didn't really like my pork and kimchi soup that much, but the chicken was VERY good. Crispy with sweet and garlic sauce was definitely a good choice for me. The price of the dishes are also very good - I think my soup order was $8. That isn't too bad compared to other locations. Their side dishes are slightly more disappointing though - there was a lot of radishes and cucumbers, along with kimchi of course.

What I did find really impressive was the service. Our waiter was a star and highlight of the night. He was so polite, knowledgeable, courteous, prompt and so forth! I'd definitely return here."}
{"text":"Do not make the mistake like I did twice! I went to the one on Saint-Catherine thinking it was the AYCE bbq it wasn't, we actually walked out. Now I went to this one and it STILL wasnt the one I was looking for. This time we stayed. Now I know its the other location on the same street. 
I suspect they have a different standard for spicyness because I was dying. Everything was delicious though, but so spicy!
We had the sweet and spicy fried chicken, some bulgogi soup, the little red rice sticks and some fried dumplings. The soup was amazing, so tasty and different than Pho. 
The reason I have 2 stars for service is that they gave us the wrong bill. With all the commotion at the front door I didnt check right away. We ended up paying close to 10$ more than what we were supposed to."}
{"text":"Service was horrible. They were slow and keep on forgetting our table, such as side dishes, rice and water. I also expected a big plate for hot and spicy chicken with cheese, but i get 1/4 of the plate, i had to pay 24.99 for that crap!"}
{"text":"We were craving fried chicken and decided to make our way to Mon Ami. Went there a few times already but the place used to be packed on evenings. But with more franchise opening around montreal, we didn't have to wait and the restaurant was not overly crowded. It was easy to find free parking nearby. 
Went there with a party of 4 plus 1 toddler and ordered about 4 meals to share (the whole fried chicken with their seasoned sweet sauce, hot stir fried rice cake, bulgogi bbq, the seafood and green onion pancake along with 2 rice cake skewers). 
It was super tasteful!!!! Their fried chicken is AMAZING. My son enjoyed the rice cake skewers (sweet grilled taste). 
We are never disappointed when going to mon ami. On top of good food, they have a really good customer service. Quick, efficient, polite, they never made us feel rushed or them being bothered. 
Would definitely return when craving for koream food!!"}
{"text":"I saw the reviews on Yelp and wanted to try this restaurant for a while now. Had the chance to go there the other day. We were greeted by a very friendly gentlemen who told us we could sit anywhere since there was no one in the place.  When I first try out a restaurant and there's no one when I get there I always prepare for the worst, especially when the restaurant is only a couple of tables with some chairs and doesn't even really look like a restaurant. Still we sat down and took a look at the menu, the waiter came and helped us since there was a lot if Korean items to choose from. There is about 50 items on the menu but we came there for the chicken so that's what we settled for.  We took a the boneless spicy chicken with some rice and it came with pickled raddish and a salad. Now at first the raddish and salad didn't look really good but I still tried them out and let me tell you it was delicious, I ate the whole thing. After a few minutes the chicken came and I have to say this has to be some of the best chicken I ever ate.  It was cut to perfection no nerves or anything nasty in the chicken, the meat was perfectly cooked and super crispy, as for the sauce it was simply amazing, so hot and so sweet at the same time that every bite would leave your mouth burning but you couldn't resist going for another one.  At the end there was nothing left in the plate.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE WORTH THE DRIVE EVEN IF YOU DON'T LIVE CLOSEBY!"}
{"text":"Not much more to add than what was already said. I also preferred Mon Ami to Dawa. The fried chicken is so crispy, it's off the hook yum. I also had Bibimbap and the amount of beef in it was the most generous out of all the Korean places I've visited in Montreal (Chez Bong, Ganadara, Kantapia, a place near Decarie, and several others, the names of which escape me). The flavoring is really on the spot and the staff is super sweet. At first glance, the prices of some plates (such as the specialties and the fried chicken) look expensive, but then you see the huge portions. Our small order of chicken for $10.99 was actually 7 pieces of medium sized meat. Very generous. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Get the fried chicken.   I know you go to Korean places for the bibimbap (which is good here) but seriously....order the chicken.     These folks make some mean Korean fried chicken.    I've had it from a ton of different places and this place does it very well."}
{"text":"MUST TRY!!! Well worth the travel. In a vibrant and bustling city, this little restaurant is definitely a gem to mine. Each and every time, we have yet to be disappointed. Service is fast and straight to the point, food is uncomplicated yet leave a lasting impression that leave us wanting more. This is simplicity at its best. I've only ever came back for one thing - their original fried chicken is the best of its kind, an experience I've yet to match anywhere else I've dined before.

Their fried chicken is perfection. The meat is perfectly seasoned to the bones, skin so light and flakey yet sported a wicked crisp. The meat is impeccably tender and moist; even the oh-so-often undesirable white meat was delightful enjoyed. Price, quality, and taste unmatched by none. We ordered 2 whole chicken for 4 diners, which left us at a good spot. There are a variety of different dipping sauces at a charge (we all favoured the spicy sweet sauce and the soy garlic).   

Overall, I would make the drive from Toronto to Montreal again, just for another order of this. Overall, the best fried chicken hands down, bar-none. MUST TRY!!!"}
{"text":"Been there maybe 2-3 times since my older review and I really feel like the \" quality \" in the plates is lower than it was. The waiters didn't even bring us banchan last time, the ramen and the rice cakes are not cooked well and the taste of the plates(think soon tofu...) has really changed. It was our last time at Mon ami unfortunately :("}
{"text":"The fried chicken and the corn cheese.....Party in the mouth. 

Must try, you won't regret."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out today for lunch as I saw they had the lunch special. The girl was nice and sweet, mentioned that it was my first time here; she gave me some recommendations on what to have. She did mention that they're more famous for their fried chicken but I finally decided to go for the bibimbap. It was delicious. Loved the presentation of the food. 

I had my first bite and I really liked it. It was piping hot and spicy. I enjoyed the consistency and it did fill me up. The portions are quite huge. I even thought for take out but finished it all in the end. The restaurant was quite empty but the service was great and the food is amazing. I would definitely recommend it for the Korean food lovers as they have a variety of specialities on their menu.

I would come back for their fried chicken next time! :)"}
{"text":"Verrrryyyy slow wait and service throughout the night. We waited about 30-40mins to be seated (we were a group of 3 at around 7pm on a Thursday night). There were only 2 employees working all tables and the cash so yeah, makes sense that service was slow.

After we put in our order, the waiter informed us that kimchi is extra for $1 whereas at the Downtown location, it was complimentary. The food was delicious but not as good as the Downtown one (probably because they have so many more employees so the food comes out faster). Loved the hot stir-fried rice cake - not too spicy, the vegetable dumplings, the kimchi, but the highlight is that friend chicken yum! We got a whole fried chicken shared between 3 and we were in a food coma by the end of it."}
{"text":"I will definitely went there second time. Their fried chicken is the best I have ever eat in Montreal. I will try the boneless chicken next time. I also like the fried shrimp and pig feet, both the quality and quantity are very good. I do not like their steam dumplings. This place is awesome."}
{"text":"This chicken is so good you'll fall to the floor!  Literally, the woman sitting next to us had to go to the hospital cuz she hit her head so hard falling down from her chair!  She brought the chicken with her, dontworry"}
{"text":"The quest for a good Korean restaurant in Montréal has officially come to an end, my friends. THIS is the place to go for some good, solid, home-cooked Korean food, and if the fact that I basically downed all of it in one sitting isn't a clear indication, then brace yourselves.

Upon walking in, I was greeted with a wait time of approximately 10-15 minutes, which totally was okay with me despite having travelled by metro and bus to get there. Hey, you gotta do what you gotta do to get good food, right? Anyway, it seemed popping with a mostly Asian crowd gorging on KFC (Korean Fried Chicken, that is) and other Korean specialities like soft tofu stew and bibimbap, which is always a good sign. After being seated, I decided to go with the half order of fried chicken, a plate of fried mandu (dumplings), and a kimchi jjigae (pork, kimchi, and tofu stew served with rice). It may seem like a lot, but it was all worth it in the end.

Besides the fact that they actually give you a decent selection of banchan (things like pickled radish cubes, side salad with thousand island dressing, kimchi and other pickled vegetables), everything clearly seemed to be freshly made in house and comes out piping hot. The kimchi jjigae was served with its contents boiling in the pot, just like it should, and it was perfectly spicy and contained just the right amount of each ingredient. The rice soaked up the broth and made it so much more dimensional that it would have been if eaten plain. The mandu were crisp and contained a nice meat filling, and even though I've had better, it came with 12 of them so I didn't really care because they still tasted good! Finally, the star of the meal came out, and it was - you guessed it - the FRIED CHICKEN. OMG. I think I died and went to heaven upon biting into the super-crispy, twice-fried outer layer and sunk my teeth into juicy meat heaven. It helped a lot too that KFC is mostly served with dark meat instead of white because everyone who knows chicken is aware of the fact that THAT'S where all the flavor is. The batter was also well-seasoned and served as a perfect soggy-proof coating for the chicken. Basically, all of these criteria are what make Korean Fried Chicken the absolute gold standard, especially when compared to its often-soggy, underseasoned American counterpart. 

At the end of the meal, I was almost completely stuffed but over the moon at the same time. Even though I have to travel 4.5 miles (sorry for the Americanisms, haha) by public transportation to get here, Mon Ami deserves nothing less than a 5-star rating, and I would 100% come back at the next opportunity."}
{"text":"If you're in Montreal and looking for Korean BBQ, look no further. All the ingredients that were served to us were fresh and tasted delicious. Service was quick and the waitress was fun and friendly. The wait to get your food was short. Fun place to eat!"}
{"text":"J'ai commencé par cocher 4 étoiles, mais je vais donner 5 étoiles à ce resto parce que mon expérience totale était super! Je m'explique:

Dimanche dernier, mon chum et moi avons décidé de finalement y aller. Ça faisait longtemps qu'on voulait découvrir Mon Ami, mais ça adonnait juste pas. Premièrement, c'est BYO, donc on a apporté bières (Tsing Tao) et Saké. Pourquoi pas?

Le serveur, très poli mais un peu gêné, nous a gentiment amené de l'eau, un seau de glace pour l'alcool et des petits hors d'oeuvres (inclus - comme le pain dans un resto italien) Du kimchi, du daikon mariné de 2 façons.. vraiment trop bon et une salade de choux avec une vinaigrette genre Mile-îles qu'on a trouvé sans intérêt. 

Nous avons, selon tous les avis positifs sur le poulet frit.... commandé du poulet frit. MY GAAAWWWDDD c'est vraiment vrai que c'est le meilleur. J'suis généralement pas une fan de poulet frit, mais il était parfait. Pas imbibé de gras, juteux, savoureux et les épices dans la panure ont fait toute la différence.

En plus, nous avons commandé un rice cake. Bon, j'étais curieuse et c'était 1.50$ fait que why not? C'était bon, lourd par contre, et la sauce était franchement délicieuse et sucrée/épicée à point.

Comme plat principal nous avons chacun commandé un Bibimbap + Bulgogi. La viande était délicieuse et bien marinée et le plat très bon, mais l'hésitation d'enlever une étoile c'est que ce n'est pas le meilleur Bibimbap à Montréal.. Bon, mais il manquait un petit quelque chose. La sauce à Bibimbap, fait par le/la chef est juste trop bonne par contre... J'en ai mis un tas. J'aurais bien aimé leur en acheter une bouteille, mais malheureusement c'est impossible.

Mon Ami, je reviendrai c'est certain!"}
{"text":"When I go to try a restaurant, I always go to the original one because ppl always said first always better which is true. Overall foods are good! I cannot said the fried chicken is the best as I rarely eat but definitely greater than KFC!! Must try!!"}
{"text":"Tried Mon Ami tonight and it was delicious.
Sweet and spicy fried chicken is a must, seafood pancake, steamed dumplings and sides were very tasty as well. Prices are reasonable, atmosphere is quaint and service pleasant. Definitely a place my husband and I will frequent often!"}
{"text":"Its my first review about this place but i have been there many many times! Nice little place serving real asian comfort food.

Their specialty is the fried chicken.

Im a huge fried chicken fan and i tried it at many place and this place got me hooked!

One of my favorite place for this delicacy in montreal :)

The breading is rice based and it does give a nice crunchy and not greasy, that is why i like it.

The chicken has a little spicy seasoning in it which is a nice touch.

The bibimbap and tofu stew are really good but the fried chicken is a MUST.

I tried southern style fried chicken in the states my places and this korean restaurant is on the top of my list :)

Its a BYOW too which is nice to have beer and chicken.

Conclusion: you have to try this place if have not and im Coming back for sure! happy belly"}
{"text":"Best Korean BBQ in montreal, we tried other places around mtl and also some downtown which are hyped up so we thought it would be good but it wasn't. This place offers all you can eat just like the rest and also it is cheaper. $25 a person and u get unlimited drinks and also Korean side dishes such as bibimbap, soup and gimbap sushi rolls. They also have fried chicken which I personally didn't find all that great but still good that there is an option. I love making wraps here!"}
{"text":"Read about the good reviews for their fried chicken so came to try.

Went for the half fried chicken with sweet garlic sauce. The chicken was super crispy from the outside and juicy inside.  Not dry like most fried chicken places.

Also had the japchae, bibimbap and seafood pancake which were just ok.

Definitely would come back for the fried chicken."}
{"text":"Two words: HOT DAMN! That's right I said it ;-) 
Alright,the actual two words I wanted to use were: FRIED CHICKEN! Followed closely by BYOW,enough said people.

My girl Cat D. suggested it & she hasn't steered me wrong yet,so off I went. I've just moved back from the southern USA & if I learned anything there,it's how to tell lip smacking well seasoned fried chicken from the KFC/PFK stuff.

It's clean,has K-pop music videos playing on the TV & takes reservations if you can get anyone to answer the phone. Did I mention it's a BYOW? Just making sure. Staff is amicable but are easily distracted & not always attentive but they get really talkative if you use kakao talk. Prices are good for what you get. Word to the wise,don't let your eyes be bigger than your stomach. The 10.99$ fried chicken comes with 7 pieces.

The food is delicious. I don't mess with a good thing & I always go for the fried chicken without any sauce,I heard that they are too sweet. It's moist & crisped to perfection on the outside. I have been tempted to try the oven baked chicken as well. The mandu (fried dumplings) are good but I've had better. The seafood & green onion pancake is worth it. The bibimbap has a decent amount of bulgogi in it. Thinking of trying to the corn cheese next time I pop in.

On the flip side,the ramen is meh & I wish they had more of the small side options that they bring before your meal is served.

Definitely worth going out of your way to stop by but not on Tuesdays,there are closed on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"Only go for the fried chicken. It's delicious! Everything else is very average (bimbimbap, dumplings...) Service is pretty slow and disorganized, but whatever."}
{"text":"One of my really good friends brought me here and told me it was the best fried chicken ever. 
We were 4 on a Sunday night (October 2nd 2016) and we got a table right away. However around 6:30, people had to wait x 1 hour to get a table. 

I said in a previous review I really enjoy Korean food. This restaurant is over 30 min away from my place, but seriously, it was worth it !!! It cost about 50$ per couple, and we really really ate too much.

We preffered the garlic chicken to the regular one.
Absolutely loved the potato noodles (transparent one!!)
Bugangi beef was really good too.
I can't really give back comments, coz It was one of the best korean i ever had 
it's a BYOW, we didn't know before going. 

Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"It was overall a great experience. This is not the kind of place for a fancy nor romantic dinner, more suitable for a quick bite. The fried chicken is definitely a plate to try especially fried food lovers, a bit too plain when no dipping."}
{"text":"Quite possibly one of the better Korean restaurants in the greater Montréal area. If you're coming here, the best thing to get is the fried chicken. This is their specialty and you definitely won't regret it. According to my friend, this was best-fried chicken he had eaten in his entire life. Ordered the tofu stew (soondubu) and was pleasantly surprised by how flavourful and tasty it was. I've been to my fair share of Korean restaurants in my lifetime and this was definitely one of the tastiest tofu stews I've had in awhile. 

A surprising little gem tucked away in NDG, don't overlook this place! Every time I recommend it to a friend, they always come back. Also, they're BYOB which is a delightful surprise considering they're right across from the SAQ haha. Bring a group of friends for some tasty fried chicken and beer. Unpretentious place with Korean comfort food to warm the soul, I'd highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Awesome fried chicken!!! Get the saucy one!! The plain one is bit dry but still better than most places!!

I went in summer time, it is good to have an open window concept. But it was a bit hot in a hot day to eat spicy Korean food. I suggest to not being cheap in electricity bill and provide a comfortable environment for customer to eat. 

Aside from fried chicken, the other dishes are decent. Nothing special, other Korean place has more favorable sane dishes. But the fried chicken is still worth to go for!"}
{"text":"The BEST fried chicken in the city, the staff is great the menu is very well priced AND it's a BYOB. You will not be disappointed and you MUST order the fried chicken!"}
{"text":"According to my friends, this is the best fried chicken in town. It would be better if the chicken is marinated a little more or the batter has more flavor in it."}
{"text":"Best Korean restaurant I've had yet. The spicy tofu seafood stew was incredibly good. Me I'm not a big fan of fried chicken, but it was good though. Cozy warm ambiance and the hostess was very nice and surprised by how much we ate XD"}
{"text":"Among the best fried chicken I've ever had. Stays crispy even if you takeout. Perfectly spiced. Juicy. This place is a hidden gem."}
{"text":"What a great place to stumble upon by accident!  In town for work and my coworker and I were looking for dinner in the area. Read some reviews and everyone mentioned fried chicken, so among the dishes we ordered I got the soy garlic sauce fried chicken, and it was perhaps the best chicken I've ever had in my life. Everything else was very good too."}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for fried chicken but don't want KFC look no further!! 

After I eat KFC I honestly feel like crap but I don't feel like that after I eat here. There chicken is so good and not overly greasy! Also it's a BYOB so its awesome! I like to get a regular fried chicken and order the sauces on the side to dip. It's slightly cheaper to do so. If you like the sauces already on the chicken it becomes a bit like a general tao

The plate of fries is huge! The fries are crispy and super long and super hot! 

I once tried their hot & spicy chicken with cheese and I was dying! Avoid at all costs! I love spicy and I could not handle it! The waitress warned me it was very spicy and I was like yeah don't worry about it! lol 

I've been here a few times and I will definitely keep bringing people here. The food is good and it's fun to drink and get your hands dirty!"}
{"text":"You must try if you like fried chicken or korean food. We ordered  soy sauce with garlic fried chicken, tofu soup and pig's feet. Everything is great!!Even the side dishes!! 
Definitely come back again if I visit montreal."}
{"text":"Best fried chicken ever. We've only gotten take out from this place and somehow the crispy deliciousness of their chicken still survives a winter car ride home. I can't drink right now but once I can, I can only imagine how amazing and heavenly a box of the garlic crusted fried chicken with a side a beer will be. Their pancakes are so so, but I've only gotten it as takeout and that did not survive the ride home well. Was a bit of a soggy mess when it made it. They have deep fried giblets and stir fried. Deep fried for me is the hands down winner. Crispy and crunchy exterior, soft and chewy interior. All in all, I'll probably never go to kfc again for fried chicken."}
{"text":"LOVE THEIR FRIED CHICKEN! The terrace where we ate was spacious whereas inside the restaurant was quite crowded. Their side dishes have much bigger portions than other Korean restaurants I have been, especially the colesaw. The bibimbap was average but seriously, I really enjoyed the fried chicken dipped in the bibimbap hot sauce (what a mix haha)!"}
{"text":"We were in Montreal for two days, and our only food priority was really to try some poutine...the rest of our itinerary was blank. So, when searching restaurans, we thought trying some cuisine in the \"Koreatown\" of Quebec sounded good. It turned out to be the best meal of the stay.

Our group of four ordered bulgogi (beef) hot pot soup, seafood/green onion fried pancake, 12 pieces of Korean fried chicken, and ramen (we added bulgogi for an extra $3). 

The \"appetizer\" we received was in the form of three toppings: cabbage, kimchi, and turnip. The turnip was surprisingly good to eat alone.

We loved how the fried chicken arrived with a cute little trash can for the bones. The pieces were pretty small, but every bite was packed with tender, crispy goodness. Luckily there was an ample supply of napkins. The ramen was slightly spicy and salty with thin noodles. The bulgogi in the soup was also good, but the rest of the dish was underwhelming. There were just a few cheap vegetables and glass noodles.

The seafood pancake was the best! It had pieces of scallop, shrimp, and other unidentifiable yummy things. Although it look super fried, it tasted light and not excessively oily. Highly recommended.

All throughout, our server was very patient and understanding. Even as he escorted other customers to their seats, he still was attentive and welcoming. If we're ever in the area again, we will come back!"}
{"text":"So my cousins have been raving about this place. They kept on saying how good the fried chicken is and boy were they right! Moist, super crispy with a hint of hotness to it. I now understand their enthusiasm. I also ordered a dolsot bibimbap and to be honest, had better elsewhere. The seafood pancake was so big and scrumptious and the kimchi ramen was comforting for the tummy!  Hidden in NDG, this place is worth the detour. Be sure to get there soon or make reservations. The place fills up quite fast at around 7:30 pm. Very reasonable prices and the waitresses were very nice. Before leaving the restaurant, i have ordered a big serving of fried chicken for 18,99$+tax and two different types of sauces to take home. Had some for a late night munchies and it was still crispy! Hmmm!!! A very pleasant discovery and i will be back soon"}
{"text":"Mon Ami just opened yesterday.  Ordered some fried chicken, spicy pork stir fry and steamed dumplings to go.  Fried chicken was amazing. Light, not greasy at all, extra crispy and very high quality pieces of meat.  Spicy pork stir fry was outstanding, nice and spicy, and the steamed dumplings were extremely fresh and delicious.  Waitstaff were friendly and prices were very reasonable.  This place is a gem!  I really hope it sticks around."}
