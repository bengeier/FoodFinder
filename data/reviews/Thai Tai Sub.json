{"text":"This is my \"Go-To\" place for Vietnamese subs. The price is right at $6.45 for a foot long chicken sub with cheese and veggies. They are very busy but they are also very friendly and customer service oriented. I highly recommend coming here."}
{"text":"The ultimate sub is just fantastic - beef, chicken, cilantro, carrots, and thai sauce. Get an order of spring rolls as well. Great for lunch, dinner and late night. Very delicious and good value. Not traditional Viet sub, but definitely hits the spot. Try one of these and you will never want to eat any other type of sub again!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, very friendly we had the chicken curry and the wonton soup with the salad rolls. All very good very convenient from our fairmont hotel, open late!"}
{"text":"I eat too much at this location, probably to the point where I am beginning to consider it decent Vietnamese food. Usually I order the combo 1, which is pork coated in some undefinable sweet sauce, the beef-with-sweet-onion skewers, a couple of spring rolls and rice or vermicelli. It's ok I suppose, but lacks inspiration. Kind of feel like its the McDonald's of Vietnamese food in the city. For that reason I feel guilty for eating here, so recently it has been less and less. They are relatively quick and the price is very reasonable for what you get. 12/30"}
{"text":"Quite possibly the greasiest sate beef sub I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"Imagine my excitement when I turned the corner after a long day of work and right in front of me, in all its glory, stood this downtown location of Thai Tai. *Cue heavenly music now*   I LOVE the bubble tea at Thai Tai, so I rushed in and ordered my favourite: Strawberry Mango with pearls please.   The woman working the front was friendly, sweet and efficient. I had my bubble tea in hand within moments and was well on my way.   The prices are great, the service is awesome, the bubble tea is heavenly, and the music they play is catchy! You can't help tap your foot while you wait for your meal.   I'm a Thai Tai girl, now and forever."}
{"text":"The service provided by the ladies in the kitchen is very efficient and robust. As I am very busy during the day it is a great stop to get something quick. I love the amount of meat they provide on the dishes they provide and at times I would recommend they put on less? Not sure if that is a critique. As Thai/Vietnamese is definitely my favourite type of foods I like to keep abreast of the various different fast food Thai/Vietnamese places out there. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent staff! I really like the sauce they use for their noodle bowls"}
{"text":"What is it about Thai Tai that always sucks me in as I walk past with every intention of eating a home?  Maybe it's that their quality is consistent all the time. Or the fact that it delicious. Or that even though you wait a little it means no one is microwaving your meal at the back. Or that the combination of bubble teas is endless even though I always end up choosing the same one. Maybe its all of those things.  I am a sucker for the lemon grass chicken sub - with hoisin sauce please and thanks. Love that the toppings are always fresh and crunch and you can choose what you want depending on the day. The spring rolls are delicious, just remember to ask for the veggie ones if that's what you want cause meat spring rolls are the default order. I always ask for extra hoisin to go with them and never an issue to grab me some.  Bubble tea options for me always end up with a combo of watermelon and lychee with no bubbles. Its so good! And think it is the best cure from the terrible decisions you made at the bar the night before. I always go sans bubbles - not a fan of tapioca - but you have your choice of bubbles or flavored jelly too.  Service is always quick, efficient and friendly. Sufice to say I am not sure if you could stop me coming back for more."}
{"text":"Oh, Thai Tai. I love how eating one of your delicious Buddha Veggie subs makes me feel like I'm being healthy, even when I stumble in to your location on a Saturday night; drunk as a lemur. I've only ever had great service here, and unlike your 17 Ave location, your bathroom doesn't have signs on the door that lie to me.  Bonus star for always giving me extra tofu. Or maybe the 17 Ave location is just stingy, and this is the proper amount! Oh, well."}
{"text":"I love this place. It is right across the street from work, so I am often frequenting the grill. I kind of feel like it is fast food, but not that crap you get at McDonalds or Edo. Its fresh, tasty and quick. I always modify the order, add BBQ pork or hold the shrimp. Some tweak that is always accepted and I agree with previous reviewers. The bubble tea is great. If you're down town give this place a try."}
{"text":"The Vietnamese po-boys are great here. Like some others, I thought it was a little unusual to have the subs on brown bread, instead of regular French bread. But Very cheap, very casual, and fantastic taste. Highly recommended for a quick sandwich in downtown Calgary!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, good portions. Doesn't dazzle tho.  Pros: Nice guy behind counter, food is decent (maybe good by downtown Calgary standards even), price is good (less than $8/meal) Cons: Long waits depending on time and luck (I go around same time each day, sometimes long lines sometimes no line)"}
{"text":"The best Vietnamese at a price you can't beat. The subs are delicious, love the vegetarian options and they are always accommodating to customize your order. The satay soup is also one of the most tasty in the city!"}
{"text":"This place was just around the corner from my hotel, and I'm glad it was!   The guy working the front was incredibly friendly and welcoming.   I ordered the lemongrass chicken sub and 3 salad rolls, and it was a lot of food. All the toppings on the sub were fresh, and I really appreciated that you can choose what to put on (helpful for the cilantro haters out there).   I wish I was in town longer to visit again."}
{"text":"I love their subs here.  The one I always get is the LEMONGRASS BEEF SUB with everything on it and extra Thai chillies.    Love it if you like spicy!!    Oh yes, they have BROWN BREAD!!"}
{"text":"I crave the butter chicken sub. There are other great kinds, but the butter chicken is the one I think about when people suggest boring pizza again. Loaded with fixin's of your choice including cucumber, cilantro, picked julienne carrots."}
{"text":"This is the last remaining Thai Tai in downtown after the one in Chinatown closed. It's my favourite Vietnamese sub hands down.   I rarely get to this area of downtown, but I've been fortunate enough to be nearby twice in the last two weeks! Chicken Sate is all I ever get cuz I love it too much to ever order anything else. Fantastic baguettes - soft yet crusty, dense enough to support the toppings while still being light. They use great quality flavourful chicken and fresh veggies and always use the perfect amount of sauce. Love it!"}
{"text":"This is the best value in downtown Calgary for a tasty yet filling meal.  I come here at least once a week for a Vietnamese sub (banh mi).  The service is friendly, food quality is high, and  prices can't be beat."}
{"text":"After 8 years of living in Mexico and having some of the most amazing food I have ever eaten, I sure was impressed with eating at Thai Thai sub.  What a different taste sensation to savor fresh cilantro, lemon grass and tai chili beef in a sub sandwich.  The bread is also brown!  Plus the price, all this goodness for less than seven dollars is that possible? Tai Tai, great healthy food for affordable price with a fast food slant."}
{"text":"The sub is a bit disappointing. I ordered the lemon grass chicken sub and it was pretty dry. Just not enough sauce. The rating here is so high and I am not sure what went wrong. Well the portion is huge. Well, I mean the sub is quite long.   There are no seats here. I mean there are stool bar seats that faces the wall. But during lunch time, people walk in order and end up sitting at those stool bar seats waiting for their food. So really, you might just take it to go instead."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick lunch. Avoid 1230-1pm because it just gets crazy in here.   Subs go for $6.15 which is a great deal. Sate beef and sate chicken are staples here.   It usually comes with cheese which is definitely not a Vietnamese thing so I usually opt out of the cheese. You can also them to go light on the mayo too. There is also a choice of white or whole wheat bread.   After you order, you can pick from a variety of toppings. Add them all for full effect and bam, you now have a glorious Vietnamese sandwich in your hands.   You can thank me later."}
{"text":"We discovered this place while in Calgary for a conference. Calgary had been expensive for food until this dive, which runs about $7 per sandwich. Great banh mi, I had the chicken sate and the chicken curry-- the latter had more flavorful meat. They have bubble smoothies that are large enough to be a meal, and cost $5. This grill was a great break from the high food prices without being a meat-and-bread place. Only bar seating, and people will be brushing you, so better to do takeout. They also have noodles and soups. My friend had the fried spring roll noodles and it was too much for her to finish. It came with \"dressings\" of chili paste and vinegar."}
{"text":"I was in Calgary for business and was trying to find a nice quick place that I felt comfortable eating on my own.   I saw the good reviews for this place and I was not disappointed. The staff were both very friendly and seemed to genuinely enjoy working there and making the food. The relaxed atmosphere made me feel comfortable to hang out for a bit and eat my food there.   The food itself was excellent. The sandwiches are far bigger than I was expecting which was great as I was pretty ravenous.   I got the sate pork sub and the flavours were great. A nice hint of spice from the chilis and hot sauce but not overwhelming. I also tried the spring rolls which were crispy and hot, freshly made.   I'm from Vancouver and we have quite a high standard for Asian restaurants so it was such a pleasant surprise finding somewhere just as good if not better in Calgary."}
{"text":"Great Thai Tai location.  The person helping us was quite friendly and even offered us water when we decided not to get anything to drink.  Would have gotten 5 stars but the dining area was a bit untidy."}
{"text":"The subs here are really fresh and delicious and have it's own unique blend of flavour. The brown bread they serve kind of threw me off, I'm a fan of the original white bread for Vietnamese subs. Sort of like how Chinese food just ain't the same without the MSG. Anyway, the bubbletea was awesome I highly recommend trying watermelon. If you're walking by and in the mood to try something different definitely pop in and give Thai Tai a try."}
{"text":"Very good Vietnamese subs in downtown... The bread is very good and very fresh... Also, they fill it with great stuff....Plus the location is very convenient... I am a big fan of those subs!!.."}
{"text":"A decent vietnamese sub, nothing special.  I had some summer rolls, which were kind of old and didn't taste quite right.  Not a bad place to catch a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Urghhh.  Maybe I'm just spoiled because I come from a place in California with a ton of really great banhi mi places, but ughh...  Don't be fooled by the name, this isn't a Thai food place but rather a Vietnamese sandwich place with other boba teas and grilled noodles/meat dishes.  A few soups, but no pho.  The flavor with the sandwich would be OK if the meat weren't such poor quality.  The Thati tea I had too was also awful.  It tasted like bad tea powder and too much milk.....probably exactly what it was.  do your self a favor and just don't eat at this chain, for real."}
