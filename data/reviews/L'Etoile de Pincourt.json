{"text":"My favourite place to dine the best food. Not too pricey and not at all greasy so you don't feel fat and nasty after eating. The food is made with care I'm in love with this place I've eaten many dishes from here and the pizza is my favourite it's so good. The service has always been the best. I highly recommend this place is beats anything in the area"}
{"text":"I'm biased cause I grew up eating l'etoile food my entire life!!! But It's legit delicious. And now I'm vegan and they make me the best vegan dishes  I'm always enjoying comfort food there and everything is homemade I'll always love it."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza from there it  was extremely salty tasted as if somebody had dumped half the salt shaker in.I was trying the restaurant since it had been reopened but unfortunately the food seems the same as it was before."}
{"text":"Honestly,after it burned and came back years later.i was skeptical,I heard the first month being reopened it had lost it's touch.i went tonight and it was just fantastic,highly recommend,hope they still use the same sub sauce"}
{"text":"Always fresh and tasty! Whether dining-in or delivery, the food is always warm, portions are perfect and staff is nice. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"After burning down and being closed for years L'etoile has open its doors again. I dismissed the place for the same old pizza joint that existed there before, But with all new decor that feels classy and a new menu that has some great choices on it, its back with a bang! I ordered the L'etoile burger with a side order of yam fries and spicy chipotle mayo, it was delicious. It was topped with fresh veg and well sauced so you can still taste the burger meat. My buddy had the L'etoile sub and agreed with me that this place easily has the best burgers and subs on the island. You gotta give this place a try !!!"}
