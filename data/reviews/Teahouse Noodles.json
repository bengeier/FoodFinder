{"text":"Extremely quick, well priced, and a variety of options. Those who complain about the lack of taste must be used to extremely sugary and salty foods, because Teahouse manages to strike the perfect balance between flavor and healthiness, in my opinion. Also, the staff are really polite, down to earth people.

Also, you should try a bowl with a combination of the rica, curry, and peanut sauces sometime. One of the workers turned me on to it and I get it every time I go there. How's that for some flavor?"}
{"text":"Get the rica rica sauce- there is no better option!!!  

They are very asian fusion so don't go expecting to have a  traditional pad thai or lo mein dish.  

It is all very fresh and everything is steamed for you upon ordering.  

My favorite and only thing I get there is a noodle bowl with tofu and rica rica sauce and it's delicious every time :)"}
{"text":"I like the variety of options here.  I also like that the staff is willing to help make decisions, because I'm so awful at deciding when there's a plethora of options.  
I've never had anything I didn't particularly like here.  Just remember to mix your noodles, or you'll eat all of the sauce first!"}
{"text":"Super delicious. Super cheap. Super quick.

The carb conscious can even skip carbs altogether and opt for a bowl full of steamed veggies and sauce. The curry noodles with chicken is definitely the best item. 

There is a small parking lot in the back which never seems full. But, if you're in nearby Case or UH, I recommend walking over on the off-chance of hearing the air wolf theme song emanating from one of the nearby residential buildings."}
{"text":"I went to teahouse noodles while walking from the train station at university circle.  I was tired after a long trip and was hoping for some good food, but unfortunately that's not what I got.  I ordered pad thai and got something that wasn't really much like it.  The spicing was not good at all and that is what makes or break it.  And they didn't even mix the sauce all the way, the bottom portion was just plain noodles!  It was so bland I almost didn't finish it.  Which is saying a lot for me.  Unfortunately on campus there really isn't an alternative, but I won't be coming back here."}

Pros: The food comes quickly, very quickly. They have all the ingredients ready and at hand and all they have to do is mix. The pricing for a \"make it yourself\" noodle bowl is $7 for the average bowl, I believe. I have to say that the ingredients are healthy. Unless you drink the leftover sauce, the food does not contain a lot of oil. Why? see below.

Speaking of sauces, the RicaRica sauce is good: light and similar to sweet and sour sauce, which I really enjoy. Yea. This review is biased.

Cons: 
1st, the noodles are just plain noodles. Bland. Nothing at all like noodles you can get at Superior Pho or 99 Pho.
2nd, the chicken, is bland as well! Fortunately, it is not dry. However, it is simply cut pieces of baked chicken breast. Healthy, but insipid.
3rd, the portion is not very big. It is not enough to fill you if you are a hungry and growing boy..

Bottom Line: this is an asian fusion restaurant.........."}
{"text":"I work at UH, so it's conveniently located and the positive Yelp feedback made me think it could be a good lunch option. The first time I went there, I ordered noodles with tofu and lemongrass spiked chicken broth. While it was tasty, it was a meal that I easily could have created at home for less than half of the price. I also didn't love that there wasn't enough broth to be much of a soup (maybe I misinterpreted what I was getting...). 

Take 2, I tried Teahouse again for lunch today and ordered the veggie bowl with chicken and rica rica sauce. While the sauce was really good, the veggies and chicken were swimming in the sauce....there was at least an inch of sauce at the bottom of my takeout container. I found myself straining the veggies and \"ringing them out\" with my fork...not something you should need to do with a good meal. So much for a healthy lunch - I feel like I just ingested an unnecessary few hundred calories worth of sauce (I don't even want to think about the sodium). 

I wish the food was better. There's a good chance I'm just not ordering the right thing, but I don't want to waste any more money or calories playing roulette trying to figure out the winning combinations."}
{"text":"After seeing the signs plastered to telephone poles all around University Circle for ages I finally ate here; and I've been looking forward to coming back ever since. The owner was in when I ate here, and he was really friendly and provided excellent, quick service. I sampled all the sauces before choosing, and the Rica-Rica is AMAZING. I'll need to try that (and possibly buy a bottle) next time. 

The vegetables are steamed right when you order, and are served with either rice or noodles, and your choice of protein and sauce. The tofu is really peculiar (in a good way), and I can honestly say it's the best tofu I've ever had. 

Overall, this place is awesome. It's cheap, healthy, yummy, and very quick."}
{"text":"Yom, yom, yom.. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.

Like any restaurant, what you think of Teahouse really depends on what you're expecting.  Personally, I love the Pad Thai (especially the peanut sauce), the spring rolls, the smoothies, and the noodle bowls.  Sometimes other selections can be a little bland, so if you're there for some major flavor, and you're not sure what you want, make sure to let them know.

The employees are 100% awesome.  I've eaten there at least 2x/month since they opened, and the food is really consistent and the staff is nice and helpful.

If you're in a hurry, call ahead, and you're food will be waiting for you."}
{"text":"I was craving some chinese-flavored food (I'm not a stickler for authenticity in this department, just settling for good-tasting food) one day and decided to give this place a try. I've only heard good things about it so I was pretty excited. The service was really fast and the staff was very nice, taking the time to explain to me how to order and what to expect. However, there was a special on the sign outside that they put out daily and when I asked about it the guy had no clue what I was referring to. Odd, if you put the sign out promoting the special everyday.

I ordered the chicken veggie bowl with teriyaki sauce. I don't know how they can even call that sauce teriyaki. It was too sweet and watery, which ruined the entire bowl with the sopping sauce. Also, the veggie list included many authentic Chinese vegetables like snow peas and bean sprouts, yet my bowl didn't have any of those and instead was filled with shredded lettuce. The chicken was dry. The only semi-authentic thing I found in my bowl was the use of green onions. I will not go back here despite the fact that I live just around the corner here, I'd rather go pretty much anywhere else."}
{"text":"I can't believe two things...one, that I didn't review this place while I was living in Cleveland. Two...that nobody else has yet reviewed this location. Shame bombs to all.

Based on reviews for the other location (which I never visited), I imagine this location is similar. It is small, cozy, and inviting (just watch the first step...or was it the second?). You check out the menu, you ask questions that the dude behind the counter is all too happy to answer, then you place an order. Said dude behind said counter quickly conjures up your selection, and then you eat it. And it is good. Fresh, healthy (unless you really don't want to be, I guess), hot, satisfying...all good things to have in Cleveland (especially during the winter).

The noodle/rice dishes are the main deal, but their steamed buns are amazing as well. Soup, too...plus a very extensive smoothie/tea selection. 

Places like this are what make Cleveland great...they are super awesome in every way, plus affordable on top of all that. People in Cleveland loved to hate on living in Cleveland, but when/if they leave they get annoyed that they don't have a Teahouse Noodles to stop by whenever they wanted. Food for thought...chew it well."}
