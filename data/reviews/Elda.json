{"text":"Excellent petit resto de quartier! Souci du détails dans les assiettes, produits de qualité et tout simplement délicieux! Bonne sélection de vin et serveurs sympas! Le tout pour un prix très correct! J'y reviendrai!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite bistros in Montreal! But don't take my word for it, try it for yourself. Here's my breakdown:

Food: amazing food, fresh ingredients, interesting twists on classics like fish+chips and burgers in addition to more modern plates. P.S. Try the crab cakes!

Prices: incredibly reasonable prices on both food and drinks 

Service: Amazing staff is welcoming, courteous and always have a smile on their face.

Ambience: what a great vibe, I've been for both weekend brunch and weekday lunch and the vibe has been warm, hip and fun every time.

Wouldn't hesitate to return!"}
{"text":"Lovely bistro with a nice variety of food. We checked it out in the evening and had their cocktail of the moment Ti' Punch, which was delicious. 

One friend had the burger and the other had the veggie burger. I had the artichoke tartine. Both my friends loved their dishes, including the salad and potatoes. The tartine I had is cut into four which would be perfect as an appetizer to share. I still ate it all and quite enjoyed it. 

Also on the menu: beef tartare, house made gravlax, chowder, and salads. Daily specials included a duck, a mussels dish and a soup. 

The wines, cocktails and food were all on point. I will definitely be back for brunch. The place was full of happy patrons and the vibe was quite nice so I'm sure Elda will soon be a staple in the neighbourhood. The team behind Mile-Ex did well with Elda."}
{"text":"Had the Cochon Braisé à l'érable. One word: AMAZING. It says they're closed on Sundays but they just started it three weeks ago. Food presentation is nice and the taste was beyond my expectations. Definitely give it a shot, especially if the other brunch locations (Fabergé and Lawrence) have longer wait times. You won't regret it"}
{"text":"My dinner review for Elda:
Came back for a friend's birthday last weekend and unfortunately, still not a fan of this place, although I do have mixed feelings. So the waitstaff and prices are very good, I appreciated the attentive service both times I came and the prices are very reasonable, especially for wine bottles (you can get a good bottle for under $45, I think they start at $32).

However, when it comes to the actual food, I'm not a fan. I ordered the beef tartare which was a very good portion and came with a house salad and baked potato wedges, all for $17, which is good. However, the tartare was cut very poorly, with some inedible and very chewy chunks of raw beef I had to discreetly spit back out... my tartare was very average, I've definitely had better. They also have a very small and limited menu (about 7 items + a few daily specials) which for me isn't enough choice cause I'm a picky eater. Will not be back, sorry!

My brunch review for Elda:
Went here for a friend's birthday back in March, and we were a party of about 20. Since we were a very large group, definitely kudos to the waitresses who took care of our table; the service was good for such a large group.

The menu seemed interesting, although not what I would typically want in a brunch menu (where are the eggs benedict?). I ended up opting for a latte and the vegetable omelette with chorizo, which was served with a garden salad and roasted potatoes. Alex came too and got the brioche dorée with poached pears and maple caramel (served with ice cream!). I ended up eating a bit of both dishes and thought they were good, but nothing special. The omelette was very average and so were the potatoes. I did enjoy the brioche more, but it was a very sweet plate for a brunch dish, it may have been more fitting as a dessert. The coffee was good though, so no complaints there.

Overall, it was an average experience, both in terms of the food and the actual outting.

{"text":"Excellent brunch au Elda! Choix originaux, variés et pour tous les goûts.
Nous avons pris la quiche au butternut et les huevos rancheros, et les 2 plats étaient vraiment délicieux. La salade qui vient en accompagnement aux plats est vraiment bonne, sa vinaigrette aussi!
Prix corrects, très bon service.
A essayer!"}
{"text":"Faberge and Lawrence had waits. This place was only 25% full. Excellent meals (two had the assiette de cabin and one the braised pork), unusually great service for Montreal, and a nice space. Loved it."}
{"text":"Updating review - two brunches later, I'm up to 5!

Fantastic huevos rancheros. Crunchy and fresh and delicious ingredients. 
Beautifully presented smoked salmon plate - literally looks like a painting. 

The plates next to us - the granola bowl and the veggie burger looked amazing. 

Filling, great quality, fair price.

I love that the menu keeps changing, as it keeps me coming back :)"}
{"text":"Great service, great food for some American tourists who had no idea what they were doing."}
{"text":"Initially many of the other brunch spots had big lines and this wasnt quite there yet. But gradually began filling up. The setting here is sort of classy with the wine rack on display and sort of kitschy with the 50s style shop counter. The menu is small and the place seems kind of new even though it looks like it's been there for awhile. The waitress staff were friendly but didn't sound convincing when asked about the items on the menu, which makes me think it's new. This is a good thing though, I feel like being among the first in a recent spot helps it take off. My meal delivered. I don't remember the exact meat but it was pulled with cornbread, eggs, cream and lard added with potatoes and canteloupe. Not all of it sounds good but it was actually pretty damn good and the presentation was excellent. The entree reminded me of something I order near my home amexcept with a French twist. The setting is open and bright but small and more intimate like a small cafe. Definitely drop in if it's 3 or less in your party and don't want a lot of choices."}
{"text":"Gotta say I was a bit disappointed. There's been lots of good reviews and press and hype but at the end of the day the food was just so-so. Pretty much every dish (except for the ceviche) was missing that extra spark or flavour that makes it memorable. 

Our server was friendly and cool, the ambience is fine, but doubtful I'll feel the need to go back."}
{"text":"Looking for a good brunch and very hungry, we came here instead of waiting in the huge line around the corner for Faberge. So glad we did! It was quiet when we first sat down but by the time we left it was full since it's not a very big place. The ambience is really cool. It's like an old diner but with high-end food. The service was very good too.

Although the menu is small, the dishes are carefully prepared and thoughtfully presented. I went with the toast and lox. It was so pretty. I especially liked how they matched the orange color of the lox with orange mandarin pieces! The creamy spread it comes with is to die for. I also tasted some of the pork and wow, it just may have been the best I've ever had. Huge portion and very very tender and flavorful. Don't forget the bellinis, they make them with fresh squeezed juice!

They also have free wifi which is a nice perk."}
{"text":"Great decor. It's fresh and inviting.

However, service was below par (took forever to take our order, didn't bring out our coffee until our meals came, no milk and sugar for th coffee) and the food merdiocre (far too salty)."}
{"text":"Bien qu'il soit ouvert que depuis quelques mois, Elda est l'un de mes endroits préférés! Je savais bien que ce petit bistro n'allait pas me décevoir. Après tout, c'est le nouveau projet de Grégory Paul, chef du Mile Ex (mon resto favori, allez-y). 

Nous retrouvons certains classiques du Mile Ex, ainsi qu'une variété de plats à partager. C'est bon, c'est frais et en plus, c'est pas cher! La carte de vin, elle aussi, est plus qu'abordable.

Ce restaurant convivial marque aussi des points pour la qualité de son service. Eléonore et Gabriel sont d'excellents hôtes. J'ai déjà hâte d'y retourner encore!"}
{"text":"Great place. Quality food, good people trying hard to please. Big group, so we tried a lot, and all was good. Tacos particularly delicious."}
{"text":"So, for a breakfast place to be excellent, it needs amazing coffee and great food! This place has ok coffee and great food. Cappuccinos are your standard quality. Not bad but no wow factor either. Food is very good with beautiful presentations! There are options for people who dont like eggs. Service is nice and rapid! Best of all, they take reservations! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This new restaurant is very small and its kitchen takes half the space - from a profit point of view, it is probably not the best design. However, you should know that when the chef is happy with the work environment, your belly will be happy with the food he provides! We came for brunch and I would say it has the best quality/price ratio in mile-end currently. I almost don't wanna share this review so i can continue to drop in without a reservation while laughing at those who line up for Laurence across the street. Besides brunch, the dinner menu looks great and the wine selection is interesting (private importation ?), definitely worth another try! 
tip1: still make a reservation because the bar seats are not comfortable. 
tip2: salmon gravlax portion is huge and inexpensive, boudin burger with pineapple is great, and the pork belly that melts in your mouth is worth a try."}
{"text":"I have been to Elda multiple times and it is always a pleasure! Ordering a main, splitting a bottle, and getting a dessert you can expect to pay $50 a head. 

By the same owners of Mile-Ex, this bistro offers high-end plates at a very reasonable price considering the quality! 

Be aware that this is in no way a \"speedy-service\" joint. Would not recommend for a fast in-n-out. However, you will have a great dinner experience. In this regard, Elda is a great date night spot, or place to catch up with friends! 

Rotating specials menu tends to propose a fish of the day, meat of the day, and oysters. Prices for these plates hover in the $20-$25 range. Food is beautifully plated and well thought out. 

Standard dinner menu offers something for the foodie (beef tartar etc),the more down to earth (burger, veggie burger), and even many solid vegetarian offerings! 

Great wine menu with bottles that are extremely reasonably priced considering the more \" high-end \" feel of the restaurant. Bottles range in the $32-$45 range. Waiters are well aware of bottles and are able to propose great tips!"}
{"text":"A very welcoming and delicious spot for Brunch! I ordered the omelette of the day and coffee. It came with a green salad and perfectly cooked fried potatoes. It was a little pricey, around $23 CAD with tip, but I would return."}
