{"text":"Actually I would give it 2.5 stars. It's a good way to get out and taste some restaurants around Calgary. But it really seemd like a repeat of last year. I felt that the booths were cramped together and they could have used a little more space giving room for people to move more freely. 

Tickets were $1 each, however most items were 2 or 4 tickets with the odd 3 ticket sample in there.

Overall it was a nice sunny day but really I think I will hit up a different festival next year and skip this one."}
{"text":"Taste of Calgary is an awesome summer event that I look forward to each year! Food, sun, live music... what's not to love? My friends and I usually go down for sweets and deserts, but you can easily enjoy lunch or dinner too. What's great is that you can get a variety of different cultural foods, and it encourages you to try foods you normal wouldn't... like ox tail!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst taste of/bite of festival I have ever been to.  The tickets are a stupid idea, the venue is cramped and the food is poor overall.   Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"The idea is neat, you get to sample all sorts of different foods, I really like that. Not keen on buying tickets up front and then pay with these for your food, but I can understand why they do it. What disappointed me was the price of the samples. I thought it was overpriced as the samples were pretty small most of the times but the price was usually $3-$6 or more. Isn't this whole event a great advertisement for the participating restaurants? I think they should see it more like this instead of an opportunity to make money. I would have sampled more if the prices would have been a bit more reasonable."}
{"text":"This was my first experience with Taste of Calgary and it wasn't too bad. It wasn't quite as big or as busy as I expected, and the dessert selection was sorely limited, but the food I did try was excellent. I wish there had been more restaurants in attendance, as I came ready to spend! At Taste of Edmonton I always went multiple days and spent about $60-$100 on my favorite eats, but at at Taste of Calgary my boyfriend & I together only spent $30! Overall a great way to spend a few hours, but definitely needs a boost."}
{"text":"You came here to eat ergo spend lots of money on small samples, but if you are a foodie, you will be at home and skip the traps that a noob would fall for like paying 4 dollars for a slider thats all bun lol.  

Lack of bevvys aside from water or beer, would have loved more choice there.  

Overall was a very chill and fun walking festival.  

Spent 55 dollars but was decently satisfied.

Props to:
banana cake
Hong kong shaved ice
Steak bites
Cabbage rolls / perogy / sausage combo : best value at $5"}
{"text":"Fun in the sun! It always seems to be a super hot day for this festival! 
It is in Eau-Claire and we never have an issue finding free parking on the street.
The set-up appears to be the same every year - I always know where the free pizza sample truck is!
You buy tickets and then you roam around to the local food stands and pay as many tickets for whatever items that they are serving up.
There is a beer garden area that also has wine and whiskey - same tickets apply bought from the same place and all tickets are $1 each. The average drinks sample is $3 and food is about $4 for a small plate to try. 
I had some saffron ice cream today, that was the best!
There are a few clothing vendors too, an Ipad repair stand, Car To Go stand, Shaw, etc.
It is crowded, I find it a tight space to go through the throngs of people, strollers and doggies but it makes for a fun time and we like to see what the local offerings are and support these businesses!
After you are done roaming around, you can head over to the beautiful Prince's Island Park by the river to walk off any calories you have consumed!
For 2 people with drink and some food, we paid $25 for tickets. Not bad. Free to get into the festival."}
{"text":"This is my 3rd consecutive year going to Taste of Calgary but first year attending not as a volunteer. When I would volunteer for Taste of Calgary it would be apart of something called the \"Free nTeam\". This is because the Taste of Calgary event produces so much waste that the city almost shut it down. If the event did not want to be shut down then it had to make changes because one busy weekend was producing a lot of garbage. They made everything compostable from utensils, to the bowls. I love that idea. 
The reason that this event is only a four start though is because they have very very little seating, which for elderly people or children who may need to sit while eating- this makes it impossible so I wish they would improve their seating options."}
{"text":"Weak

Overpriced and underwhelming. This is basically an opportunity for restaurants to cash in on mass prepped food. If taste of Calgary is supposed to be a culturally diverse  eating experience they failed miserably. When you have a food truck cooking frozen pizzas and selling them by the slice you know you have missed the mark. Lets try and make this about the small guys with the authentic food next time...not places like the Canadian Brewhouse chain."}
{"text":"As my it was my first visit to Taste of Calgary, I was happily surprised with the festival.

I have to say that I don't agree with the majority of reviews currently posted. First of all, being a festival you have to recognize that you probably won't be saving money by attending one of these events. There were also a lot of people there and you could easily find the most popular items based on lines alone. I sampled and enjoyed many of the food dishes as well as a lot of the samples available in the liquor area. Being that it was a few weeks ago now, I can remember the one thing that stood out for me and that was the watermelon juice with mango pearls from Bubblicious. I would never have known about this place as it is located so far in the North East but now I will go out of my way to travel there again some time.

I had a lot of fun at the Taste of Calgary and got to enjoy many dishes that I would have otherwise avoided. I'll be back next year."}
{"text":"It has a long time since I attended the Taste of Calgary event and it seems that it will be a long time again before I consider taking the time and interest again.  Prices for food samples were overpriced for sizes available.  The beer garden was even a bigger ripoff.  When I think of beer garden the picture in my mind is fair pricing on decent-sized glasses of beer as an example with proper places to sit and savour the experience..  What I experienced was receiving  a little plastic cup with about three swallows of beer that barely lasted a few seconds.  I felt ripped off with the price too.  After spending twenty dollars for tickets unaware of what I was getting into, made me feel further cheated.  It seems someone wants a big buck at the customers' expense.  Thanks a whole heap for ruining an event that I so looked forward to attending."}
{"text":"Well the event is not big. Its my first Taste of Calgary event and I have to say it was ok. Its basically a big spot where all the food trucks are in one location. It also seems that every food truck is selling the same stuff. 

There are some other stands like TD and Car 2 Go where you get to spin and win. Nothing too WOW. 

Just ok."}
{"text":"I've been frustrated by ToC's recent history and in particular its having the exact same menus and tired list of vendors every year, but this year's event is hitting all the right notes. There are some very innovative tents like the ones from Pure Vietnamese Kitchen and one selling BBQ duck neck (I'm almost intrigued!), good coffee at last from Kaffeeklatsch, a great representation from our exploding craft beer community and a very diverse assortment of food trucks in the spot furthest to the east side of the plaza. I dropped $20 on tickets day 1 and will be back to more damage on day 2."}
{"text":"This was my first Taste of Calgary and I did enjoy it, who doesn't enjoy eating and drinking in a public park on a beautiful summer day? 

I thought it was kinda expensive and it was a lot smaller than I thought it was going to be. There was only a handful for restaurants to sample from and they shared similar palates e.g., African restaurant that served curry-like foods across from an Indian restaurant serving curry-like foods. 

If there were at least 30 restaurants participating each day from different parts of the world, then it would be a real taste of Calgary. I was expecting less known establishments to be there-- not franchises such as Brewsters and Coco Brooks, who had tents there too.

So some of the positives:
-great location
-great human crowds (non-human crowds like wasps was not so great.)
-great drinks!** 
-decent parking

Some of the \"oh nos\":
-not enough variety of food (but what I did taste was delicious)
-kinda expensive, I spent $25 and went home hungry
-the music wasn't loud enough-- and there was a great live band, so this was a major bummer.
-WASPS!!! I feel like every wasp in city was at Taste of Calgary. 

Overall, I think I would go again but maybe just for the beverage garden! It's the best place to get your monies worth. Many of the drinks were a good size for 2-3 tickets. For rum, whiskey, long island ice tea... so most likely, you'll find me at the  beverage garden next year :)"}
{"text":"So I was struggling between three and four stars for this event. Part of me is frustrated by some of the ticket prices and portion sizes of some of the vendors yet the other part of me loves the variety and the excellence of the food presented. However, the latter part of me is much stronger than the former, so I ended up with a 4-star review. 

There are tons of options from Thai, to Indian, to Caribbean, to Greek, to Canadian, so there is something for everyone. The diversity is just amazing and it's a great chance for you to try something that you might not otherwise eat or for you to try a new restaurant all together. I now have a couple of new places on my list of places to frequent (which is already getting quite long.) 

A review from last year did mention that there needs to be a great spread of places. I don't have any comparison, but there did seem to be decent geographical representation this go-around. It was a little odd, though, that Jackie's Thai (which is in the food court at the Market) was also one of the vendors, but that was the only oddity I could see.

The venue is in the entirety of the outdoor space of the Eau Claire market and it's really well used. There are multiple places to buy tickets which are $1 each (so try not to get caught in the one long line at the entrance.) There were about 25-30 vendors this year and then another good group that were in the beer garden area. Like I said earlier, the variety was excellent and most places also had a good sampling of their menu with an appetizer-style dish, a couple of entrees, and maybe a dessert. There were also a couple of dessert-specific booths, such as ice-cream melts. 

Because of the way the space is laid out, it's perfect for small/large groups, families with kids, and people with dogs. It really is a great way to spend the day and eat some great food. There are also live bands and other vendors to keep yourself occupied while you are digesting your food. 

The only thing that I would say was that there was a time during the afternoon that it got pretty crowded and the lines were pretty long. Also, towards the end of the afternoon, many of the vendors were selling out of their premium items. So, I would say that getting there earlier rather than later is a good idea. You also need to find  a place to park downtown (or take the train) so an early arrival is good all-around. 

I will definitely be looking forward to this event next year, and I will arrive much earlier."}
{"text":"If this is supposed to be a taste of Calgary then where is the diversity from around the city?

For the most part, they take the Eau Claire food court and move it outside into tents. Sure there are a few other businesses like Pegasus, but when one of the \"tastes\" is Mini Melts, a large corporation, that doesn't really represent what Calgary has to offer.

Now don't get me wrong, I did enjoy myself, but I just expected more from this festival. They advertise that you can get a taste for only $1, but you're going to be hard pressed to find anything for a buck. I saw one place that had a piece of bread. Everything else was at least $2 but averaged between $3-4.

The best area was the beer gardens. This is truly where the festival lives up to its name. There were about a dozen different breweries and liquor vendors to sample. You could get beer, cider, mixed drinks, tequila, rum, whiskey, and more. This area is probably the only reason I would come to check out this festival again."}
