{"text":"We enjoy finding small cute cafes like this one with a covered patio out front.  Considering the size of this café, we were surprised to see the number of tables inside and a good selection of mouthwatering baked goods.

What we ordered:  
- Quiche Lorriane (Black Forrest Ham and Emmental Cheese).  The crust was light and flaky, different from traditional quiche crust.  The filling was decent and it came with small fresh salad.  
- Ontario Sweet Peach Pie.  The pie came out warm, just the way I like it.  Loved the buttery and flaky crust.  \"Sweet Peach Pie\" wasn't sweet at all, it was a bit tart.  But that didn't stop me from eating every bit of it.

Café Florentin is a great neighborhood joint.  We liked the atmosphere and decor.  Service for us was a bit slow, 15 minutes to warm up a quiche and cut a piece of pie?

Next time, I'll have to give their coffee a try."}
{"text":"Happy to report that the cafe is bug-free.  I've been here for two hours and have enjoyed myself so much that I have not done any work.  Instead, I've surfed the web using the free wi-fi, given myself the caffeine shakes with a delicious latte, and then tried to get rid of the shakes with a  tasty soup and salad combo and a pot of tea (alright, and perhaps a small pastry). I may never leave, especially since I refuse to be productive and instead bask in the glory of nothingness! 

I love this place!"}
{"text":"The hours are dynamite (7am-10pm daily - I can't think of a single Toronto cafe, not even Starbucks, that is open that consistently) and the baked goods are smashing (I tried a mini lemon tart and linzer cookie - $0.55 each). The chairs are crazy comfortable and I could sit here from morning to close as the wi-fi is free and reliable. Only one problem: flying insects. Scads of them.

I have a phobia of flies and there were dozens upon dozens swarming around the food and throughout the cafe. There were wasps in the dessert display case and even though I wasn't ready to eat my cookies I had to hurry, because there was a wasp party taking place on my plate. Therein lies the problem with having an open storefront/doors, I suppose. Because of this I'd hesitate to make this a regular place during warm weather.

Also, there are two sparrows in here with me right now. Like, right next to my table, practically perched on my laptop lid. And it smells faintly of diapers but I don't see any children or adult babies. Funny how that shit lingers."}
