{"text":"We've eaten at Room Service many times, and love the mixture of its being a nice place to sit, and  its being friendly.  Elegant comfort food. Tracy and Washington are welcoming and get to know the customers.  We'll add our praise to all the dishes mentioned in the other reveiws, but also mention the superb, light, fried chicken, and the world's most flavourful bread pudding. It may be the world's best bread pudding."}
{"text":"Never been to this restaurant but buy a coupon on an online site. We seldom go to this area, so we give it a try. It is a small restaurant with a bar, red walls and chandelier. It is a family restaurant. The owner is very nice and friendly and the baby she is carrying is so cute. She introduced us the restaurant with her husband Chef Washington. It is a Caribbean restaurant more on the Trinidad flavor fusion with French cooking.   We ordered the plantain which is very good. It is a stuffed banana. The look is a brown banana but the taste is awesome. I have never tried food like this. Then comes the shrimp soup. We have the ox tail and the chicken roti. The chicken inside is so tender and juicy. They must have secret recipe to achieve this. Of course we would miss the bread pudding. It is moist and soft, tastes a little bit like the Christmas cake.  It is very different from any traditional Caribbean food that I have before. I will come back for the Jerk Chicken."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, food & service.  I had the Stuffed Plantain (appetizer), the Jerk Tofu & the Bread Pudding. My friend had the Stuffed Chicken Breast. Both of us loved the food! The Stuffed Plantain was a great combination of salty and sweet, the Jerk Tofu was spicy enough, the vegetables were delicious, the rice and peas was perfect. The Bread Pudding was to die for.  Food took awhile to come, but everything tasted so fresh that it was worth it. Also the wait staff checked in with us regularly to give us updates on the food and to refill our beverages so it was a pleasant wait. The Chef came to speak to us during our meal to ask if everything was to our satisfaction.  The ambiance is really nice - the music (old reggae, motown) was nice and not too loud; the art and decor was welcoming; the restaurant had a really nice vibe.  A charming slight upscale Caribbean restaurant. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"If you like appetizers you MUST order the stuffed plantain with Ackee!! It was by far the best thing on their menu! The atmosphere is definitely cozy, yet elegant.  The waiters that assisted us were in training, therefore I wont comment on the service since they were clearly still gathering their wits! Room Service is special because they cook your meal from scratch once ordered (jerk chicken and all) !! Although this is good for people with food allergies, it can be very time consuming.  Waiting for a meal for over an hour is a bit much. Because i genuinely  wish good for them I wont harp on how inadequate the service and wait times were :( The point is that the food is definitely tasty..and maybe on a day when I'm in the mood to seriously wait, will I try again"}
{"text":"This is not your average jamaican food restaurant. The place is trendy but cozy and it is good to bring your family, bring your date, have a business dinner, or if you in the mood, just have a cup of coffee and bring your laptop and do some work. The food is delicious and affordable. I can say I am already a regular.  My recommendations: If it is breakfast you're looking for, ackee and salt fish accompanied of a cup of  gourmet blue mountain coffee. Regular dinner or lunch, red peas soup (the bowl of soup is huge and for me this is more than enough, no need of order anything on the side), the veggie rotti is fantastic and again the serving is quite a bit, Stuffed Chicken breast is delicious to say the least. And if you are in the mood for dessert: bread pudding. The sorrel drink is something unique to this place and I totally recommend it.   Also worth to mention is the attention you get, nice people who makes you feel at home."}
{"text":"I walked into Room Service by fluke when my initial plans for a late lunch at Khemer Thai were botched. I was pleasantly surprised. I am a newbie when it comes to Jamaican food but was easily won over by the flavours. I sampled the chicken roti and the Jamaican chicken stew. The chicken roti was big and came with a side salad. The curry flavour was dominant and the chicken/potato mix oozed out. Extremely filling. The Jamaican stew came with rice (choice of other sides) and veggies and had a sticky sweet sauce - although not too saucy. The prize accessory to the dish was the super hot, yellow hot sauce that came on the side. To finish, my friend and I split a sorrel drink made with hibiscus flower, cloves, ginger, cinnamon and something to make it taste sweet.  Room Service also serves brunch in addition to its lengthy Caribbean dishes. I would totally go back. This place is affordable and tasty."}
{"text":"When I called to make the reservation for mother's day, I specifically said I wanted to have lunch. To my surprise, when I got there I was told that only breakfast would be served because they'd be closed at 1 PM for a private party. I had just been about to ask a question about the chicken and the server said \"You can ask me a question for next time\". That showed extreme arrogance in assuming this first time customer would return.  They must have been concentrating on the private party more than the other guests because our experience was terrible. The lackluster breakfast took a very long time to arrive. The server said \"everything here is made fresh\" however the food's appearance and taste contradicted this. The service was so careless, that while waiting for the bill, the server accidentally served us another table's food. Considering that table waited longer than we did, it was quite the oversight.   Overall, it wasn't a good mother's day and this restaurant needs to be avoided especially for any special event dining."}
