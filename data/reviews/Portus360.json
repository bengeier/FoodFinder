{"text":"The food and view was great but I can not recommend this place. If you have a food allergy DO NOT go. We had dinner Saturday night and tried the tasting menu but explained to our waiter in both French and English that my wife has a severe allergy to shellfish (shrimp, lobster, crab) which means nothing can touch or be prepared with those items. The first sharing plate came out with a lobster salad on the same platter with the cod, ray and other fish. The server described everything to us except the lobster salad and when we asked what was in it he couldn't tell us. We got our waiter over and asked and he said it was the lobster salad and we reminded him of my wife's allergy again and that she couldn't have anything on that platter.  Soon after this they brought a number of dishes including fried shrimp and the waiter carried the shrimp platter and other platters together.  It seemed they didn't get or worry about the allergy so one has to wonder if the kitchen is careful in their prep and transference."}
{"text":"The best thing about this restaurant is the great view. The room is spacious and the windows are huge. The prices are not cheap, it's no secret that you are paying for the view first and foremost.  The food was OK. I liked my dishes (despite being somewhat over seasoned) but some of my friends were not impressed.  The service is what brought down my rating. It was never hostile, but increasingly unpleasant as the evening progressed. The server looked like she was tired of being there and annoyed with us. Maybe her behavior was caused by external circumstances, nonetheless it's not a nice impression to take home."}
{"text":"This place unfortunately is a gimmick.  Food is ok.  Service is really not good- not at these prices.   This place has so much potential and the view is magnificent.  To bad the view is so nice- they don't stay open for the food."}
{"text":"Views wonderful..It takes 2 hours total to do a 360n. Food decent.. Service leaves much to be desired."}
{"text":"My wife and I went out on a date, a nice way to put some extra spark in our relationship.  This restaurant is quite nice looking and the revolving room lets you get a great view of the city.  For starters my wife had the fried octopus which she loved. I had the salad which was ok but for the size, and quality it was way over priced at $16. But still we were impressed that we started to make plans to come back with my wife's parents and our kids.  Then came the extremely long wait for our main course. I was starved. Yes we got 4 small pieces of bread in a quaint bag. But do they fisinfect it between customers? You have to put your hand inside the bag and it is the flu season. Then despite making it very evident that the bag was empty, I had to ask for more.  Finally the main courses came.  My wife had the seafood risotto. The seafood was ok but the rice and sauce were inedible because of the extreme saltiness.  I had the steak. A very small piece of meat, which would have been ok except for all the gristle. I even had trouble cutting the meat despite using a steak knife.  Why didn\"t we send our food back? We were hungry and tired, and really didn't want to wait another very long time.  We had a dessert that was very average, and I had an ordinary green tea for $4!!!  So our second time here - first and last.  So the place is nice and the revolving part is very nice. But unless you love salt or gristle, I suggest you go somewhere else."}
{"text":"We had no idea they had moved here from St Laurent, we found it by fluke on OpenTable last minute on Saturday night. The space is awesome and even though in the evening you don't see as much its great view of the city lights. It does take 2 hours to do the full 360, we managed to get great sights of the igloo fest on the cold snowy night. Beware that people with motion sickness might be a tad sensitive to the movement. We opted for the tasting menu which was broken down into 4 services. The scallop ceviche and asparagus salad were delicious and left us inspired to try and replicate the recipe at home. Next up were the razor clams and shrimps, both came with sauces to die for. Our main meals were red snapper and sides of vegetables, the fish was a little on the cold side as I'm guessing our waiter was busy with other tables. The dessert was an assortment of sweets such as fresh baked paste de nata, carrot cake and a Natas do ceu  We loved the fact that the first person we saw was Helen and she was working away making sure the ship was running just right."}
{"text":"Had an amazing time at Portus360 today. Our reservation was for 12:30 (party of 5) and we were seated very quickly. Firstly, I have to mention that the sun enters beautifully in the room and makes it very peaceful, the reason I mention it is because I have recently tried another restaurant with \"a view\" in the same area and everything seemed so dark (the dark decoration probably didn't help). We ordered from the lunch menu (25$) and weren't disappointed...Everything tasted amazingly well from my beef teriyaki to the duck and the peach dessert all the guests were unanimous they had a great time. My only negative comment would go to the time they took before taking our orders apparently because of a miscommunication between waitresses but they apologized for it and it was much appreciated. I definitely recommend this Portuguese restaurant if you're in the area, you won't regret that 360-degree rotation view of downtown Montreal."}
{"text":"Le prix est fixe, pour environ 70$ vous avez l'entré que vous partagez, (je pense qu'il y a 4 petites entrés), le plat principal, j'ai pris une fois le poisson et une autre fois le riz au fruits de mer que je n'ai pas aimé, et le dessert, que vous devez aussi partager, le dessert est super bon. Pour le prix, j'ai trouvé que c'est assez ordinaire, rien de special à part la vue qui est magnifique (1 étoile de plus pour la vue)."}
{"text":"Want a 360 degree view of Montreal while dining at a unique rotating restaurant with authentic artisanal cuisine (?!!!!)...This is your spot!  Location- Located on the 31st floor of a skyscraper in downtown Montreal you will find a mostly locally known restaurant called Portus360 featuring Portuguese inspired cuisine from up and coming Canadian Chef Helena Loureiro.  Upon exiting the elevator, the team member will lead you up some bright orange steps to the tiled, circular rotating restaurant.  The Views- While it was winter and a snowstorm was impending-it was nice as we \"rotated\" at our table to look out the windows which were labeled with the area that you were viewing on the window.  The entire rotation takes two hours.  The Menu and Food- The Menu is in French.  It was Canadian $25.00 fixed price selections of an appetizer, substantial main plate, and dessert. (Keep in mind that the USA Dollar exchange is $1.28 in Canadian dollars-so it is an excellent deal!).  The staff is bilingual and if you do not understand French they will describe the options in English.  Our Orders:  The meal starts off with authentic French Baguette with olive oil and an olive medley.  I had the Octopus appetizer which was a tender leg with radicchio on top with a accompaniment of caviar and greens.  For the main Meal=Pork Medallions with Fingerling Potatoes and a pickled beet and grilled zucchini medley.  My parents had-a creamy soup (I forget the kind as I was into my Octopus!), Portuguese Seafood Stew and Monkfish.  Dessert was an elegant chocolate Cheesecake with pistacchios and creme fraiche.  Outstanding meal and view. Will NOT dissappoint.  About Chef Helena-\"Helena launched her second book, Helena's Portuguese kitchen, at Éditions de l'Homme, in the fall of 2015 (available in both French and English) and announces the relocation of its first creation: the Portus Calle will be reborn Portus360 in the spring of 2016 in the premises of the former \"Tour de Ville\", beacon of Montreal culture.\"   Source: https://portus360.com/en/  FYI- My favorite part is the inception of the meal when your food is served-the wait staff always says \"Bon Appetit!\"  Also all food is FRESH...there was a seafood bar displaying the fish and seafood."}
{"text":"Went here for our 1st year wedding anniversary. We had gone to Portus Calle a few years ago and loved the food and ambiance. The view is very nice from above and it took a little over 2 hours to do a full turn. It is a lot bigger and less intimate than Portus Calle. The concept is a bit touristy but pleasant for a special occasion. As the evening crowd came in, it does get rather noisy....  As for the food, we ordered the asparagus salad, the seafood platter for 2, razor clams and a whole fish to share. The seafood is prepared expertly, fresh and well seasoned. It was nice that the whole fish was served table side by the waiter. Our waitress was curteous and efficient though I was disappointed that she didn't have much knowledge of the daily catches. A few of these were commonly consumed Portuguese fishes (we chose something called the Goraz only because the  name sounded funny :P) and when asked what their taste or texture were, she had no clue....we took a chance and luckily it was delicious.  Overall nice experience."}
{"text":"What a wonderful restaurant.  It starts revolving at some point in the evening during dinner.  Our waiter was super great and brought out our dinner once the restaurant started moving. He told us he delayed it on purpose so that we can have a nice view of the sunset with our dinner! We started off with the cod croquettes which were perfect!  They brought out complimentary bread, chorizo butter , and olives !  You can ask for more bread if you want For our main dish we got the seafood platter that feeds two.  This was so worth it.  Lots of seafood and super fresh. The sauce was delicious I wanted more bread to dip it in!  Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"On y va clairement pour la vue et l'expérience.. C'est vraiment un très bon concept, le resto tourne très lentement, ce qui fait que vous changerez de décor régulièrement... ça prend 2h pour un tour complet, soit un repas non pressé Le menu midi, à 25$ pour entrée, plat, dessert, vaut vraiment la peine! Excellent service, excellents plats, copieux et raffinés! Seul petit hic, le verre de vin à 14$..  Un must do à Montréal!"}
{"text":"This review is for the diner menu, which is awesome. Lunch is good also, but nothing compares to the diners. The food is spectacular, both in quality and quantities. The view of the city is outstanding and the service is great. One of my favorite spots in Montreal for the complete experience."}
{"text":"The entry looks like appetizer size and price higher than I had in the City. The Bacalhau Nata with more potato and found small layers of Cod. Other than that the view is spectacular."}
{"text":"The view is just spectacular. I ordered the Lamb which came with veggies,  also order short ribs tapas which was excellent! Dessert was refreshing. Always nice to check out a new place!!"}
{"text":"If you're willing to pay for under seasoned seafood, tough lamb and small overpriced portions with a beautiful view, Portus 360 is for you!   I've been to these types of restaurants multiple times. I know that you're paying more for the service and the view than the actual food itself. So i came with very low standards knowing that the food wasn't going to be good.   With that being said, I received the seafood rice and there was no seasoning. I had to wave down one of the waiters to get salt and pepper that they had placed on an awkward separate table decently far from us (I didnt know if it was a self serve and the waiters never came around to check up on us). You should have seen the amount of salt and pepper that i had to put to make the plate okay-ish. My sister had the lamb and it was impossible to eat. The meat was so chewy and tough that I just gave up and didnt want it anymore.   Some restaurants redeem themselves with the service but it was not the case here. We were served the salted cod croquettes and the whole table thought it was overly salty. I've been to Portugal and I know salted cod, but this was veryyyyy salty, so much that our lips were so dry after eating it. We mentioned to the waitress and the first thing she said \"oh that's how it's suppose to be\"... okay..... I know but that's not how you're suppose to approach the situation. I wish she was more polite about it. To top it all of, towards the end of the meal the waiters were rushing us to finish and wanted to clear our the plates before we were even done. Instead of taking into consideration the feedback and learning from their mistakes they were so quick to give us attitude and brush us off. I've never experienced such disrespectful waiters in all of the hundreds of restaurants I've been to all over the world!  I understand that we were a big group of 20 people & it might have been overwhelming but that doesn't excuse the poor service and below average food. Out of 20 people, everyone had something negative to say about their food. When the WHOLE party isn't satisfied, you know it's not us being picky or trying to be an ass; it was just a horrible experience at Portus.  Gave it a two star for food, then minus one for the service.  TLTR: One of the worst experienced with food and service and price. I will never ever be returning and will surely never recommend it."}
{"text":"I went to Portus twice. The first time was for a business event for which the appetizers they served were quite good and the view offered on the restaurant reception floor was quite nice. The second time was during lunch. The price for the lunch menu is quite reasonable for a three course meal."}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite restaurant in the entire city. Not only is the staff super sweet, but they always seat us by the window and the view is always incredible. The food is also very good and I highly recommend the rosé! Portus has such a special place in my heart and the experience is totally worth it."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best restaurants in montreal. Service is excellent, food is decadent and the view is outstanding. Largely worth the detour. Memorable night garantied!"}
{"text":"Nice ambience, and good spot for a special occasion but overpriced for what you get on your plate. Guess you pay extra for the view (which is amazing).  Had the tuna for main, and while the fish was amazing the \"rest\" on the half-filled plate was disappointing: 4 pieces of cauliflower and a carrot, all very al dente. There was a squash mousse somewhere but that was literally a tablespoon smeared across the plate for deco. A shame.  The dessert was nice, both the Natas do céu and the pasteis de natas were lovely.  Three stars for ambience, desserts and service."}
{"text":"We made a reservation here for a late Valentine's Day dinner since it seemed to be pretty booked for dinner on Fridays. Located on the top floor, this place has a gorgeous 360 degree view of the city!! The platform of the restaurant actually slowly rotates, giving you the full panoramic view when dining.  Our waitress was very pleasant and helped us in our choice of wine pairings and tasting, and guided us with the menu and specialties of the place.   We ended up starting off with bread, olives and confit along with our cod croquettes entrée which were pretty good, being soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. Next, for the main course, we ordered the seafood creamy risotto and the Portuguese beef sirloin steak. The steak was well seasoned and juicy, pairing well with its sauce and the red wine that was recommended. The risotto was deliciously creamy and cooked to perfection, and they were very generous with their seafood!! This is a must try for seafood lovers!   I would definitely recommend this place, for dinner or lunch and it's perfect for dates. The view is beautiful, the staff are great, and the food is decently priced and worth it. The only small con would be the wait time for the main dish, but the food is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Lunch menu $25 for 3 course meal ~ definitely worth it.  I find that it is so much more worthwhile to try fancier restaurant during lunch because they have decent lunch menus at affordable pricing which gives you a taste of the quality of their dishes.  I must say before event tasting the food that he restaurant has an amazing view of the city. Although it was rainy and grey today, the view was still pretty good. Took us a bit over 1 hour to eat lunch and we turned about 180 degree (I suspect you can see the 360 degree view in about 2 hrs).  We were seated quickly and the waitress took our orders in a timely fashion which is important during lunch when most people only have an hour to eat.  Had the calamari and potato salad and my friend had the soup of the day. I must say that the entree came extremely quickly...I'm pretty sure it was already prepared in advance. Nonetheless, the salad was very good. I expected big chunks of potato and small bits of calamari but presentation was fantastic. Bits of calamari were incorporated into the potato and green peas salad with fried calamari tentacles on top. The fried calamari added a really nice texture to the salad.  The main course was a seafood dish...I must say that the portion was pretty generous. The spicy buttery sauce went really nicely with the shrimps, octopus and calamari.  Dessert was also delicious...the light mousse with raspberry jelly went well with the more chocolaty cake/brownie.  Definitely recommend going there for lunch with customers, friends or date. Will absolutely come back try their dinner menu."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a nice view ! The dining area rotates around so you get a 360 view of the scenery but you'd have to be eating at the restaurant for around 3 hours before it makes a full turn. You barely notice it move because it moves really slow.   The place is designed very nice. They have really nice decor. The washroom is on the lower floor. So is the coat check.    They have menus in both English and French.  Staff here are very friendly. They are willing to explain the menus in great detail.   However the food here is not that tasty. The bread and butter is good though.    All in all. Good for the view but food is meh."}
{"text":"Beautiful Portuguese restaurant located on the 30th and 31st floors of 777 Robert-Bourassa Boulevard.    Its brilliant 360-degree rotation system allows you to take a \"tour\" of the city while you dine.   This was my first visit to Montreal (with my mom) and I highly recommend this for scenic views of the city.  The food and wine are incredible.  The décor beautiful. The service super And the staff very accommodating . Worth every penny.   Will recommend!"}
{"text":"I have traveled the world and LOVE Grilled Octopus!!  This was by far the BEST I HAVE EVER HAD!!  The Asparagus Salad is to die for!! Everything was Excellent! The service, the staff and the 360 view of Montreal. If you are in Montreal don't miss this one!!"}
{"text":"Portus360 was such a great dining experience ! While it's not somewhere I would go every weekend or every month for that matter (because it is on the pricey side), it's a great special occasion restaurant ! The restaurant not only overlooks the city of Montreal , it spins so you get the full360 (pun fully intended :) ). The view is great in daylight and once the sun goes down and you don't feel the spinning, you are just made aware of it by your surroundings and view changing. The decor inside is chic but not snobby with lots of space for seating (even for large groups) The service is friendly and professional, they really make sure to check in on you and make sure you are enjoying your experience and that you have everything you need. Like I mentioned this place is on the pricier side but in all fairness the food delivers on freshness,presentation and  flavour. We were a group so we opted for the tasting/sharing menu which is a great deal because you get to try a few different dishes and the portions are large enough that you will leave full. We had a variety of items from Tuna tataki, shrimp, octopus salad , tuna tartare, asparagus salad, lamb , pork and dessert -everything was so well prepared and fresh/packed with flavour. (We had family in from Vancouver with us that night and even THEY were impressed by the quality of the seafood) They have a great wine selection to pair with the food as well. I would definitely recommend this place for a special occasion with a group or one on one."}
{"text":"I am blown away. Let Me start by saying I have been to many Portuguese restaurants in both Portugal and in Canada... this was an exceptional experience. Helena Loureiro leads by example by keeping traditional food in mind but elevating it to another level that is so sophisticated and beautiful at the same time. Every dish was just perfect, well cooked just as ordered. The view? What an experience, it was just a perfect evening. Thank you for an incredible meal! When in Montreal we will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing business lunch with a stunning view of Montreal downtown area. They are specialized in Portuguese cuisine and we got excellent service from our waiter.  Honestly, the food were excellent from the appetizers, to main course to dessert all so yummy.  I ordered the peas potage as appetizer and beef chin piri piri.  The potage was just enough to open my appetite then there is beef chin piri piri, yummmm mouth watering just by thinking of it. The beef chin steak was cooked to perfection combined with the sauce (I taste HB sauce and maple syrup) it's just a wonderful combination.  My coworkers ordered salmon and octopus salad, they all have the same delicious comment.  Must go back!"}
{"text":"First off I have to say I've been to Helena and Portus Calle and i enjoyed them both. Helena Loureiro knows what she is doing! So my boyfriend and I attended a a birthday dinner on Saturday. The group menu consisted of four different entrees which the whole table shared, then one main for each person and three different desserts to share. First we were given bread with a chorizo spread and olives in a tiny bowl. OMG The spread was so good! I wish i didn't have to share it! The entrees were: goat cheese and cherry tomatoes in olive oil, cod croquettes, shrimp in garlic sauce, and grilled octopus. The entrees were all very good. The goat cheese and tomatoes were warm. I'm used to having bocconcini or mozzarella with cherry tomatoes but goat cheese is also a very good choice. The cod croquettes were good but it was my least favorite out of the four entrees and I've had better elsewhere. If you like cod croquettes check out Chez Doval. It was so good we ordered another round. The ones at Portus360 were more dry and grainy. I guess if you like it more healthy tasting you will like the croquettes at Portus360 better. I really liked the spicy sauce that it came with. The shrimps in garlic sauce were pretty big. The grilled octopus was cooked just the way i liked it. I was pretty full and satisfied from all the entrees and the bread. For main I had the steak. It was on a bed of matchstick potatoes and came with a side of salad. The salad was just a mix of greens and some red peppers.. it was very simple but oh so refreshing and tasty. There were pieces of chorizo on top of the steak and I don't know what the sauce was but it was thick and cheesy. MMMmm... Everything together....the cheesy sauce paired with the crunchiness of the potatoes and the extra meat on top of more meat mmm delicious! The only reason I did not give this resto five stars is because they said they would cook the steak medium rare which is how I usually like my steak but mine was more medium than medium rare. There was a birthday cake that someone brought for the birthday boy. The waiters also brought in a platter of assorted desserts but I only tried half of a tiny nata because I was so full. I definitely recommend this resto. The food is good, the view is incredible and the fact that this resto spins makes it pretty special. This resto is perfect for a date night or for a night out with friends."}
{"text":"The lunch menu was cheap but not worth it. I ordered the fish plat and it has a very strong scent like it was apple cider vinegar. The view was also not that great."}
{"text":"I went there for my graduation with my family and everyone was impressed. Food was very good. Potage was excellent and scallops were good just a little bitter. The day was beautiful so we really enjoyed the view. The staff was very friendly and they made an effort to speak Spanish with us when they heard us talking. I would definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Wonderful view , nice service, nice washroom, they have a lunch 3 services for 25$, yeah its a good spot for a date."}
{"text":"Petit restaurant bien haut dans les air qui tournent sur lui même,  d'où le nom.  le service est très bon. il faut dire que la cuisine et tout le stock est au centre alors ils sont vraiment très près.   Étant très difficile sur la nourriture,  j'avais peur du menu.  beaucoup de poisson et de fruit de mer,  tous des choses qui me rendent malade juste à l'odeur. J'ai essayé la joue de boeuf braisé.  c'était bon.  j'en avais jamais mangé avant alors je ne peux comparer,  Mais j'ai trouvé qu'il y avait quelque morceau gras.  j'imagine que c'est normal pour la coupe.  elle était accompagné de chips et une petite salade de légume.   en entrée j'ai essayer le potage de patate douce.  Bien aussi.  j'aurais aimé ajouté du poivre mais aucun au table.  Il faut dire que ce genre de restaurant on mange le plat tel quel normalement.   J'ai goûté au boeuf portugais qu'un ami à pris.  Il vient avec un oeuf cuit sur le dessus et dans un plat spécial.  Il était rendre et tes goûteux.   C'est un bon restaurant mais pas le moins cher,  Mais la qualité est au rendez vous.  Je n'ai pas eu la moindre odeur de poisson ou fruit de mer et pourtant j'étais entouré."}
