{"text":"Great steak and potato dinner joint.  The service was friendly and somewhat prompt.  The piano player was nice in the background."}
{"text":"Rocky River location. Out of four different entrees ordered at our table only 1 grilled salmon was ok. A prime rib, filet and the beef tips were poor, margarine not butter.  Dressing tasted bottled. For the price I expected a better dinner.  Longhorn or Outback, blow this place away at a cheaper price.  For the same money you can go to Chez Francois in Vermilion and actually get what you are paying for.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"Good news! The privacy wall is up. Went back for dinner and it was great. The steak, salad, drinks and dessert were all very good."}
{"text":"I have been to Ferris's twice and both times the food and service was top notch, I do recomend this restaurant, if you can't find parking, use the valet service"}
{"text":"went here on a friday night about 6pm and noone else here before, during or after we left. waitress standing around BSing. food did not live up to price. another \"gem\" we were disappointed in. we will not be back."}
{"text":"Ferris Steak House in Rocky River, Ohio. I would bypass this place for steak. The service was poor. I had to call 4 times to make a reservtion. The woman seating guests were dressed inappropiately. The decor was nice but the outside patio will be a concern in the spring with an RTA bus stop out front. My steak was ordered med rare and came back well done. The salad dressing tasted bottled. The bread was cold. Basically, I could not find one signiture item to make me return. Longhorns would be a 4 star place compared to Ferris. If you want steak pick another place .  -pam ghaster"}
{"text":"I went here for Valentine's Day dinner and fell in love. This place epitomizes what I love about Cleveland. You know how food can taste better in the right setting? That's how Ferris was for me. There are better steaks, salads, sides, drinks, and everything else in Cleveland. But for me, Ferris was a sublime and unique and exquisite experience. This is a place without pretense and a place where anyone can be comfortable. Accessible, honest, unpretentious. Oh, yeah. And good. Yeah, some of the previous reviews are accurate. It ain't Morton's, but nor is it meant to be. It's cheaper for one thing, and it's not trying to be Morton's either. I got the scampi and filet and both were cooked perfectly. My husband got the porterhouse. The beef is not free range, dry aged or grass fed, but it's tasty and cooked to order. Yeah, the chef would do well to get acquainted with a salt shaker when it comes to the steak, but that's easily cured at the table. I don't think the more critical reviews are unfair, and maybe it's just me, but I'll be back. This place is old-fashioned in all the right ways, and I adore it. Rumor has it that this location might not be long for this world, so go while you can."}
{"text":"I came here tonight with my mom because she read about it and said it is a Cleveland institution. I had a great dinner. Mostly because it is always a great time hanging out with her and that kind of makes for a memorable experience. The service was good. Operated at their own pace though. I was dehydrated from drinking the night before and the server couldn't really keep up with my water intake. It was not too fancy inside. That appealed to me. We were the first people there when they opened and everyone was really kind and warm. The neighborhood is kind of dicey. They are allegedly moving to where Swingos in Lakewood used to be, the bottom level of the Carlyle. That may be a good business move as the location could deter people from eating there. It is a shame that they would have to do so, could benefit the nice family run business though. We both ordered the 14 oz strip steaks. They were good, not great. We both agreed that for the cost, they probably were not worth it. As the previous reviewer mentioned, the salads were a let down. They did throw in maybe 5 spinach leaves to the iceberg mix. The hummus appetizer was excellent. It was similar in texture to Nate's as it was a nice creamy hummus, not overly grainy. I will always remember the fun night we had there. There are many things that make it a unique dining spot and is worth checking out once at least."}
