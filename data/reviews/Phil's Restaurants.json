{"text":"My son and I enjoy going out monthly for our preferred meal of the day and have tried all the breakfast restaurants around town and this is our favourite! We always ask for Sue and of all the breakfast waitresses we have met she is like sunshine in the morning beginning with remembering us, some of the things we usually order and her general sunny disposition as there's nothing she won't accommodate from the HP sauce to extra napkins and sour cream and ordering my sons eggs based sunny side up and their little chubbies! This place has the Best potato pancakes I have ever had! I love that they leave the pot of coffee on the table and there isn't a waitress walking around the restaurant topping up your coffee. Prices are good, place is reasonably clean, people are friendly and parking is good. See you next month Sue!"}
{"text":"Phil's downtown was the best! Best pancakes! When is the new location going to open?? We need Phil's back!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this restaurant, and I must say that my food was delicious!  The Pepsi was flat, otherwise I would've given 5 stars. I love that they serve breakfast all day, that's a major plus for me! I will definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Skummy at best, walk in, hostess doesn't say a word wile she seats you, no hi, or good morning or server will be right with you... Nothing! Then the server comes, takes our drink order, leaves, comes back, takes our food order, comes back with food, pleasant enough I suppose, go to put cream in my coffee, every creamer in the bowl had nasty dark sticky stuff all over them, never mind I no longer want cream in my coffee... Picking away at my very bitter over cooked almost sharp tasting eggs Benny, I look up and there is our hostess, standing in the doorway to the kitchen absent mindedly picking at her lips and inside her mouth then walks back into the kitchen, nasty! Glad she wasn't handling our food! Throughout the remainder of out visit she had her hands in and around her mouth! Coming from a serving industry in my youth I know that hostesses still handle enough for that to be unacceptable, the menu's for one, just think... She picks her mouth (maybe a cold sore?) then grabs your menu and you grab you menu... Gross, the back of the WHITE till monitor was grey with dirty finger prints, think about that... She touches the monitor. Dirty as it is, then puts her fingers in her mouth. No sense of sanitary at all. That is all!"}
{"text":"Well went to phils for supper ordered the meatloaf  hmmmm never had meatloaf that was round and hard . This was a very disappointing supper the service was poor and I will never eat here again it was Glenmore trail"}
{"text":"Terrible first impression. My boyfriend and I went there for lunch while our cars tires were being replaced near by. The restaurant was fairly empty around 12:45pm. Took awhile to be seated. We were given our menus then not spoken to again for 30 min. No drinks were offered and no one checked up on us. We saw many waitresses come by. Even heard one yell at the cooks in the back for pancakes. Needless to say we left as we had only little over an hour before we had to pick our car back up. We couldn't afford to wait any longer to simply get a glass of water let alone our food.  Would not return.  No comment on food."}
{"text":"Quick service, food was hot and tasty, but they failed to deliver everything we ordered, when we asked for the items, it took an additional 20 minutes. Still - the meal was great , grilled pork loin fork bfast is always a win"}
{"text":"Waited 15 minutes for service, that's letting km them know what we wanted. Not until I yelled \"anyone home?\" Only five people in restaurant and we were there before the other three people yet we were the last to be serviced. We ordered then waited another 20 minutes for our food while the other three people were eating. I asked three times about our order. They said it was the frozen hamburger paddy that was taken time to thaw & cook. I requested that they serve our breakfast then the hamburger later. Still I said if it's not here in five minutes we are going; then, the manager comes over very upset. I asked her if she had a problem with me being there as she was very defensive. Asking if we had a problem with their service. Is being said our food immediately came out; however, my niece found s plastic string in her scrambled eggs and our young friend found small pieces of hair in his French fries. Our young friend told me about the hair in his fries after we left the restaurant.  I really think reading views on Yelp would've helped me make my decision not to go there. As I thought it was just me that felt their service was terrible. I told the manager I normally go to Phil's on elbow & glenmore. Even with a full house their service is fast & friendly & not confrontational.  NEVER GOING BACK"}
{"text":"Phil's and I have had a long, satisfying relationship.  My family would be on the road a lot and we relied on Phil's as one of the chains we could afford to stop at.    These days I choose Phil's because of the standard fare, good service and reliable prices.  In fact, I've started choosing Phil's because of the non-greasy, tasty healthier options!  Their chicken chubbies are lean and flavourful, their buckwheat pancakes are good and eggs are always cooked correctly."}
{"text":"Februray 1, 9:320am-Was looking forward to breakfast here for the last week.  My client and I often enjoy our outing to this Phil's location.  We decided to try the Eggs Benedict this time and were sorely disappointed in what was served.  It looked OK when it arrived except that the hollandaise sauce was a light colour.  Well, I'm pretty sure that the sauce came from a mix, it was clear to white in colour and no taste to speak of.  My clients couldn't finish hers because she was put off.  The hash browns were good and the coffee was good, service was fine but I couldn't leave much of a tip after leaving three quarters of the food on the plate."}
{"text":"I've come to love the Phil's chain throughout the city, not just because we share a name, but because it's a straightforward, easygoing breakfast restaurant. This location, in Forest Lawn, has some of the friendliest waitstaff I've met at any location and it may be my new favourite!"}
{"text":"It's not often that I give a review on a restaurant but the Phil's location on Glenmore Trail is my favourite breakfast restaurant and warrants a great review. I've been going to this location and others for 30+  years now and have known some of the waitresses that have worked there over the years. I know that the staff there have always done their best job serving customers. They have always been fast, friendly, efficient and helpful. The food has always tasted very good and is prepared well. Phil's has always had the reputation of preparing their dishes with a down home taste. It stands to reason why this location is always very busy. Their claim to fame has always been their pancakes, pork and beef chubbies and eggs anyway you like them. The coffee is always fresh and served to you in your own coffee thermos so you don't run out.  I was told by the waitresses that Phil's was the first breakfast restaurant in Calgary and Phil himself cooked meals at the first restaurant at the 14th st. location for a time.  I go the Glenmore location a few times each month, sit and relax with a good paper and enjoy a good breakfast to start the day. Phil's is a restaurant worth going to. I hope they stay around for many more years to come."}
{"text":"This Phil's is a favourite when we have the child for the week as there is a good range of breakfast and non-breakfast items for the whole family to choose from.   The decor is pretty dated and could use an upgrade but the location is generally clean and well looked after. The service has been consistently good from visit to visit and the food quality has been good as well.   We've been here for lunch, dinner and breakfast and the experience has always been good when the place is packed or empty. There are a lot of seniors that go there, especially for dinner which usually is a good indication of decent food and good value for money. The location is accessible to with a fair amount of parking. Tip: If the lot is full, its a good sign the restaurant is full too, so you might have to wait a bit. But it will be worth the wait."}
{"text":"Phil's is that breakfast place that you go to when all the other breakfast places are full on Sunday morning; and you'll still wait in line, but not for as long.  Phil's is that classic \"I've-gone-there-since-I-was-a-kid\" place and has a giant menu complete with mini belgian waffles, pancakes, those chunky hashbrowns everyone likes and crispy bacon.  There are a few things that stick out about Phils that I think are important:  - The fruit bowl is surprisingly good, it's not just full of melons and grapes but has strawberries and kiwis too  - The Chubbies are gross. Both in name and in taste.  - If you order coffee, they put a carafe of hot coffee on your table, brilliant  - They have a mega-cheap Li'l appetites menu with meals for the \"I'm not that hungry\" person in the group  - The hollandaise is a might bit greasy, get it on the side  - Phil's is good at the classics, fried eggs, bacon, hash browns, toast, pancakes, omelets so stick to the basics here  If you don't want to wait for 300 hours while tired, hungry and (probably) hungover for breakfast, go to Phil's. You'll get down-to-earth food at a reasonable price served quickly and efficiently.  T."}
{"text":"This used to be my family's favourite breakfast restaurant, before the prices went up. (I mean, who wants to pay around $9 for over easy eggs?) Besides the prices, the food is great. I normally order sausage links, eggs, bacon, ham and toast, which, if I remember is called the \"Traditional Breakfast\". The staff is friendly but, speed of service could improve. This is a great restaurant, if you don't mind the price."}
{"text":"Phils on 14th, a blue collar restaurant catering to families and the hungover denizens of the Calgary core! Each group looking at one another stating to their friends \"glad we're not them\"   This is a restaurant review so I should talk about the food right? They seem to get my eggs right about 75% of the time which is better than some places. I really do enjoy the Traditional Mixed Grill... I mean if I am going to go out and eat pork you might as well serve it up 3 ways! Sometimes I cheat on the mix grill and go with the pancakes... buttermilk please. I enjoy the pot of coffee at my table and its usually strong as all hell but it is on the pricey side. I sometimes bring a Starbucks from down the way and they don't seem to mind.   All and all an average little place to grab a decent bite with service that is usually prompt. A great place to build a base for an early morning round of golf or checking the Sunday morning NFL lines before heading off to make a proline."}
{"text":"Kinda gross. Came in for Eggs Benedict.  Eggs seemed to have been poached way ahead of time. Muffins were hardly toasted..  Hollandaise sauce was clearly a powdered mix.   The waitress was not very friendly and I got to hear her arguing with the other staff in our section as well as see her scowl at me.   For the price this was simply poor service . I will not be back."}
{"text":"Had dinner there a couple of weeks ago, their ventilation system must have been plugged as the reek of grease permeated our lungs, clothing, etc. Our server was excellent but I can't imagine how she worked in that for an entire shift. Had a Spanish omelet and the only thing Spanish about it was the onions & peppers, USE SALSA, NOT PASTA SAUCE!  Pretty sad when even Denny's makes you look bad!"}
{"text":"I have yet to be disappointed by any of the food here. That said, there's not really anything supremely special or unique that they do here that has me eager to come back. It's ok.  One thing I really like that they do is when you order a coffee, they give you a whole carafe for the table to use. I think it's a great idea, because then the only time you have to flag down a waitress for refills is for the carafe (which, if there is only 2 of you, takes a while to get through)."}

I went with my wife today to Phil's telling her how great it had been. We were certainly in for a surprise this place is known for its breakfast of course and when we ordered coffee they didn't have any they told us all will make up a pot right away. Then my wife decided to order a Monte Cristo with shredded hash browns. My wife was then informed that they were out of shredded hash browns but she was offered potatoes instead. My thought was hey yeah get the potato have them shredded up and give her some shredded hash browns oh no that would have been too hard that would have been too much work no Whole 30 seconds to make a customer's shredded hash browns okay I can let it slide. She also ordered the Monte Cristo with no ham. The waitress came back from the kitchen and informed us that they could not make the Monte Cristo without ham because they were pre-made. Pre-made Monte Cristo's? Really don't you make a Monte Cristo with eggs as I remember so they're just sitting around after they've been coded and battered and waiting for you to order them so they can throw them in the microwave or something. So let me get this straight we came in there ordered coffee which there was none made they could not make hash browns shredded and they refused to make a Monte Cristo without ham because they're pre-made. Well guess what we did we went somewhere else. If you can't make the food fresh or at least try and satisfy the customer in some way then maybe you should close the doors. Not once in all of this did a manager come out and see us at all especially over the Monte Cristo we voted with her dollars we took them somewhere else and I will make sure that I tell everybody on social media of our experience thanks for nothing Phil\"s... go to hell"}
{"text":"Hmmm, this is an update to my previous glowing review, which I beleive is still visible on this page. I must confess, that after coming to this location for over 30  years, I doubt very much we'll be returning again anytime soon. Reason being, the recent scaled down portions. I should point out that I'm very familiar with the menu, and portion size;  It's understandable that over a  period of time a restaurant will have to raise/adjust their prices accordingly. But what Phil's has done recently is adjusted their portion size (making certain things smaller), while keeping the prices the same. But who's to say that won't go up as well!?  We recently ordered the pancakes...5 per order. They used to be quite large...maybe 6\" in diameter. Now they're half that size, but cost the same. We also ordered the Canadian Pea Meal Bacon breakfast, which used to contain 3 large slices of ham/bacon. Now these slices are pathetically puny, just slightly larger than a table spoon!  When I asked our server about this, she said Phil's reduced the portion size of many items because the minimum wage went up! What kind of an excuse is that?  Bad (stupid?) business strategy Phil's...you just lost us as customers."}
{"text":"Sometimes all you want is a greasy spoon with good service. And this is definitely the place. Just being in the retro setting and being greeted by overly cheery (somehow) staff in the early hours of the morning is a hangover cure on its own. I am always impressed when I can get amazing service at horrendous times of the day. Critically, our server kept the coffee coming the entire time.  I had the chorizo eggs benedict. I'll admit that the sausage patty was a little odd. This was my first time trying their famous \"chubbies\". Maybe they aren't for me, but to be honest they did the trick, and I can't complain for the price ($10). It included two perfectly cooked poached eggs, awesome shredded hashbrowns, sauteed peppers and onions, and obviously two chorizo chubbies on english muffings. A ton of food, really.  Here we have a local staple offering well priced greasy breakfast food with amazing service. Can't go wrong if you're out for a hearty, massive breakfast after a long night."}
{"text":"Great breakfast restaurant. Had chorizo eggs Benny was so delish! Just your typical chain restaurant that's always busy and has a decent breakfast!"}
{"text":"Not sure why all the love for this place.   The place was dead when we arrived, with only one other table of customers. The decor consists of booths and tables that look like they are circa 1970. The containers of sugar etc. sitting on the table were dented, mismatched and grimy looking.   Because of how empty the restaurant was we felt that the safest thing to choose would be a breakfast since it is served all day and it would have to be made to order. It might have been safe from the food poisoning perspective but it was pretty horrible. My scrambled eggs were brown, oily and shredded into super small pieces. The buttermilk pancakes were totally doughy and served with 3 very thin, chemically tasting flavoured syrups and my sausage were these 5 silver dollar sized greasy, chewy nougats.   But for the very pleasant and efficient server this would have been a one star for sure. Eat here at your own peril."}
{"text":"Whoever said this is the crappiest breakfast place is insane. My husband has come to Phil's since he was a kid, moved to Ontario and come here every time he's back. First place he took me when we came to Calgary. First place we went when we moved back to Calgary. We love this place. Great strong coffee. He loves the traditional mixed grill. I love the stuffed French toast and omelets. You need to have to shredded has browns not the chunky. The service is always friendly, the place is always packed and the food is always awesome. You coffee cup will never be cold or empty because you have a carafe. They do the same for tropicana oj too. This place is the best in Calgary, London, Windsor, Toronto and Barrie."}
{"text":"I went to Phil's for lunch one weekend when visiting a friend in Calgary. I was told it was a hidden gem in Calgary. I hoped their food was better than their decor, but was a little disappointed. I had a waffle with strawberries and whipped cream. It was good, but there wasn't enough strawberries and whipped cream to spread around the whole waffle. I was, however, very impressed with the coffee. All Day Breakfast places (like Denny's and IHOP) usually have terrible coffee, but Phil's had great coffee. Unfortunately, the coffee was really the only good thing I can say about my one experience at Phil's."}
{"text":"WHY would a 5 or 7 year old WHO POINTED TO THEIR ITEM OFF THE KIDS MENU TO THEIR WAITRESS have ordered an adult size of anything??!?   We are thoroughly disappointed with the service at this place lately. The food is highly mediocre as well as of late. Toast should not be hard as styrofoam.   It will be a looooong time before we return.   Do yourselves a favour - save your money and go to Cora's or even Denny's."}
{"text":"This is a place that I enjoy for sit down breakfast food. They have a standard menu of eggs with this and that. They also serve waffles and pancakes. I like having breakfast with my father here because they leave an entire pot of coffee at the table if you order coffee. A great place to relax, have a good breakfast and enjoy some conversation. The prices are very reasonable. I especially like the potato pancakes. When I order them I ask them to hold the apple sauce and give me gravy (which they charge for understandably). I haven't tried anything other than breakfast here."}
{"text":"Okay - so, I've been back to Phil's a couple of times and my review has changed slightly. Service has been consistent - the server must have been experiencing an \"off\" day when I went the first time. Although, they never seem to fill my water glass. Food  has been good - not amazing but definitely better during my first round. I've always been lucky in getting a table - seem to come just after or before the rushes.  So, all in all, Phil's is an alright place to visit, but not generally #1 on my list.  (18/30)"}
{"text":"Of all the Phil's locations I've been to in Calgary, this has probably been the most consistent one. The food is generally delicious, the service good and lines not too bad (however, I usually make my way down for brunch as opposed to breakfast).  Love that they leave the pitcher of coffee on your table (as do all locations). A great place to go for a classic breakfast.  Making me think that perhaps I should actually visit a Phil's for lunch/dinner sometime, though!"}
{"text":"A truly awful dining experience. Came for dinner. Service was so slow it took almost 2 hours from start to finish. One person in the group ordered decaf coffee. It was so weak she called it \"brown water\" and sent it back. I ordered Pepsi and got diet. Sent it back. My wife had potato pancakes. She said they were the worst she's ever eaten. Her beef chubbys were so shriveled and overcooked they looked like meatballs. My ranchero was tasty, but I ordered medium poached eggs, and they were so far beyond hard they almost crumbled into dust when I cut them. Given that it took more than half an hour from when we ordered to get food the first time, I didn't dare send it back. All in all, one of the worst meals I've experienced in Calgary in the past year."}
{"text":"We had breakfast on a Saturday with a group of friends who seem to enjoy it.  I have not eaten at a diner stole place in a while, but honestly did not like their food. I didn't like their pancakes or eggs Benedict. Their hollandaise was all won't from consistency to even colour.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"This is one restaurant I find is always consistently great food and staff is more than friendly. The parking is sufficient but you better get a spot early because it's packed everyday right at about lunchtime. The chocolate chip pancakes are amazing there and they also have potato pancakes with sour cream and apple sauce that will knock your socks off. Overall I would definitely recommend this restaurant and have several times to anyone who is looking for a delicious meal at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Nothing wrong, but nothing spectacular either... Everything during our brunch experience was OK, but nothing that I would want to go back for. the place is big, so it's good for large crowds however it gets crowded around 11 or afterwards for brunch, so be early if you can. Note: The address shows up 1 block to the west on the map, and it's a bit confusing if you rely on the GPS... don't get lost !"}
{"text":"Food Quality: 3/5 Service: 4/5 Kitchen Speed: 4/5 Parking: 4/5 Value: 3/5  Phils are very hit and miss across the city. Fortunately, this location seems to be the best.  The food is consistent as is the service.  Its a diner style restaurant so set your expectations accordingly.  Its ultra family friendly so there are lots of kids, grandparents, and friends here all the time.  If you go on a weekend for breakfast, go early or be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"I've been to two different Phil's locations in Calgary and I have to say that they are VERY different. I like the decent, cheap breakfast foods and that's all I go for.   The location on the #1 highway is never a downer - fast service, organized, pleasant staff, consistent. So naturally, I expected this location on 14th Street to be the same. Nope.   I went in after the usual lunch rush because I wanted some quiet time to eat and collect myself. When I walked in, there was one elderly man drinking coffee...and me. Perfect. Sort of. It took a solid 15 minutes for the server to acknowledge my existence and take my order. I didn't expect much from the meal, but I swear the eggs benny are better at the other location. And it arrived almost cold. Fine, whatever. I eat my meal in peace and finish up, realizing that I haven't seen the waitress since she poured my first cup of coffee (the only cup, sitting empty now for some time). She was gone.   I waited TWENTY MINUTES for her to return from audibly gossiping with the kitchen staff so I could pay my bill and get to my meeting. Did I mention I was the only customer in there that was dining? I have never been so tempted to dine and dash in my life.  When she finally appeared, she rang me through while talking very very rudely to someone on the phone (\"Whaaaat? Are you stupid, he hasn't worked here for 3 years!...What? Oh. What do you want me to do about it?\"). How do people like this have jobs? She must have been into her 50s at least, and she should know better than to be so unprofessional.   This location would get one star if it weren't for the other location that I like so much. I will never return the the 14th Street location. Disappointing."}
{"text":"The place was very dated but extremely clean ( seats, vents, windows ) so they do take care of the place. The booths were very comfortable!   I got eggs ranchero ( flour base, refried beans, 2 eggs and sauce with hasbrowns ) it was cooked perfectly and tastes very good.   My husband got corn beef hash with a side of sausage and his main meal was delicious but his side of sausage wasn't what he expected and we didn't eat it.  All in all I would recommend this restaurant for a good wholesome breakfast."}
{"text":"Ok, I really really don't understand the line ups and the hype.  Why is there always a massive line up on sundays.  I admit it, their service is top notch with experienced waitresses that have probably been there for decades and really know how to treat their customers attended to.  Coffee is decent.  But decor is just dated and ancient from the 70s.  The breakfasts aren't really any more special than most greasy spoons.  And I find they're actually pretty stingy on the meat (the sausage medallions for example are basically barely quarter sized cross cut slices of normal breakfast sausages).  I'm mixed.  I'll go there as it's a great place to go as a family or with friends(love the great selection of syrups for pancakes, and their corned beef hash is actually quite good).  But honestly, it's not even in my top 10 when someone asks me for a breakfast recommendation unless it's pretty close by.  PS: when I mentioned the corned beef hash, this is a trick question.  When the corned beef hash is listed as a special of the day, THAT's the one to order.  If it's NOT the special of the day, and ordered a la carte, it is honestly done in a completely different unappealing way.  Keep in mind!"}
{"text":"Okay so the one I actually went to was in Banff, but rather than \"Yelp\" about that specific one, methinks (as a Calgarian) it would be best to cover all the Alberta Phil's locations in general... When in Banff, I looked at the menu and everything looked neat, but I had food poisoning from another source that morning and my appetite wasn't up to par. However, I wouldn't mind trying another location of Phil's sometime in Calgary because they are family-friendly, with an upbeat atmosphere, adept waitresses and very reasonable prices. I just loooove a place that doesn't cut off the breakfast supply after 11am :)"}
{"text":"We were the only two in the resteraunt, so I was a bit worried.  The decor is straight out of the early 80s, but the food was amazing."}
{"text":"Phil's is exactly as the rating says: it's \"A-OK\". If you're looking to take your family out to get some decent breakfast in a retro environment, go to Phil's. If you're looking for really good food or a trendy location, I'd recommend probably looking somewhere else. But, like I said, everything was still good. This most recent visit, we were sat in the dining area on the right, which I much prefer to the larger, seemingly more outdated dining area on the left because I find that sound travels extremely well and, as Phil's is VERY family friendly, it can get quite loud with all of the children around.  We got very good, friendly, and brisk service which, although it was nice to have, wasn't anything extraordinary. I tried the chicken and waffle and it ended up being extremely filling but not overly satisfying, and the gravy wasn't very well spread either: in some areas, it had made everything quite soggy whilst in others, everything was bone dry. The coffee was also good but not spectacular and overall, I was a bit disappointed by the food this time around, as it wasn't as good as the last time that I came in, even though it wasn't overly great, to begin with. Luckily, the friendly and homey feel of Phil's, as well as the good service that I received, made it so that the overall experience was still a positive one."}
{"text":"A classic favorite! Great breakfast! Friendly service, lots of free parking and tables."}
