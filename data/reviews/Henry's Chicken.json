{"text":"This was my first time at Henry's and I really loved it. The owners were really nice and the chicken was really good too. We ordered a whole chicken and we almost finished it between my husband and I.  I really liked the sauce and I asked for extra ones to take home . I also ordered rice and beans which were great too. Overall experience really good and I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time today. Awesome Chicken sandwich. I really look forward to trying the pulled pork next time but back to the sandwich... Hands down best chicken sandwich you will ever have for 6.99!!!"}
{"text":"I read a few good reviews and decided to stop by to try the food. Arrived at 7:15pm to find store hours posted at the door stating the restaurant was open until 8:00pm (also checked in advance on Yelp) and the door locked. I saw a woman behind the counter so went back to my car to get out of the POURING rain, gave them a call, and was told -- completely unapologetically -- that they were closed for the day. It's not acceptable to ditch early just because you're not feelin' it. Respect your own business hours, your customers, and the integrity of the information you distribute.  Update:  Gave it a second try.  Not able to increase the rating.  I really don't understand the positive comments.  Sauce tastes mainly like the green peppers that are used to colour it.  Chicken is flavoured from roasting but lacks any form of seasoning.  Beans seem like they're straight out of the can, unrinsed/undrained and entirely unseasoned."}
{"text":"If you hear a lot of clicks on your way in, you're in the wrong place. You've accidentally gone to \"Henry's Clicking.\"  What to get: Peruvian Chicken with amazing Beans and all the sauces! What else: If you think there's better beans and sauces in Toronto, peruve it!  If you want a house built, don't come here. Go to \"Henry's Bricking.\"  How to improve: Make the chicken a little juicier and wetter and more marinaded. Advertise the products more rigorously so that more locals in Toronto know about this amazing food.  If you are looking to hire a super cool assassin, instead go to \"Henry's John Wicking.\"  Forget your Hen party, let's have a Henry party. Toronto and Montreal both have a few good rotisserie chicken places, and this is one of the tastiest in TNT. It's a pretty special little place with absolutely wonderful employees and owners. The chicken is good, and the beans are even better. They taste garlicky and dreamy and delicious. Perhaps best of all are the amazing sauces that come on the side. They may be the best sauces in history, although I cannot reveal my sauces for this information.  If you need to have blood drawn, or inoculations, you could instead try \"Henry's Pricking.\" Ahem.  It's tucked and hidden away in a residential neighbourhood to the NE of Toronto (a couple of miles from the Danforth) where nobody usually goes. But it's well worth a detour if you want some pollo. There's street parking and the portions are both delicious and hefty. Definitely one of the tastiest things I've eaten in Canada, along with some of the most genuinely nice server.  And if you're looking for special favours, instead try \"Henry's Licking.\""}
{"text":"This is authentic as you can get. The lovely owners, Lisa and Leo, had their rotisserie oven shipped all the way from Peru. Everything is home made using fresh ingredients.   Their chicken is tender and tasty and comes with a generous amount of rice. The pulled pork sandwich is tender and delicious. It's best eaten there so your sandwich doesn't get soggy from the yummy bbq sauce. Fries are thick cut and crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. The special today was Colombian empanadas 3/$5: the outside was made of cornmeal and the filling was ground pork and potatoes. The outside was crispy but the filling was a little salty. Their mild sauce was perfect for the chicken and even the empanadas; their hot sauce was a little too hot for me, so I saved it for my hubby. On the way out my eye caught sight of a can of Inca Cola, it reminded me of cream soda which I oddly liked.   They've been in business for 7 months and take great pride in making authentic Peruvian and Columbian dishes. They Cater and they deliver, how awesome is that! They plan on adding on to their menu; I can't wait. Clean and bright restaurant with a few tables and exceptional service. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Quaint little shop not far from where I am staying. This was my first run in with Peruvian food but it hit the spot. I have the chicken wrap with all the fixings. The chicken was delicious and moist and the flavors of all the vegetables with some Mayonnaise and chipotle sauce was perfect for me. A nice light but rich flavor."}
{"text":"This was so disappointing. Some of the reviews were so good. The veggies were frozen, the chicken was 'ok', the dipping sauces unremarkable. The kale salad was really not good...overall disappointing and would not recommend."}
{"text":"Third time eating from this place and could not ask for better service and the chicken is top notch. Ive had the pleasure of eating there rice, coleslaw, mixed salad, fries and both the mild and spicy chicken sauces an must say they make some of the best tasting sauces I've had. They also have this Peruvian cola called inca that they threw in with my order tonight that went well with the food and had unique taste. Defiantly a hidden gem on st.clair. Going to recommend this to friends and will be ordering again soon."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to ordering from here for awhile now.  The chicken was not seasoned and bland, the sauce saved it.  It was also kind of tough, not tender.  If my cats won't eat the chicken, I tossed to them, then there is a problem, cause they normally love chicken.  Delivery was fine and free, fries fine, coleslaw bland, corn fine,liked the sauce.  Lots of room for improvement, please salt and pepper your chicken before cooking."}
{"text":"Chicken is really juicy and loved the coleslaw and veggies.  I will definitely order from here again.  Even my very picky family enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Hidden Gem:  Authentic Peruvian charbroiled rotisserie chicken. The chicken is so juicy and flavourful by itself, but goes to the next level with the delectable sauces try the green one. The corn side is also very good and different, as well as the not-overly-sweet Inca Kola drink. As a cook from the very popular 'Wren' myself, I highly recommend stopping by this place, or for takeout. You will not be disappointed."}
