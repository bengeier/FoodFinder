{"text":"Beautiful restaurant at the Phoenician! The food comes in generous portions that are great to share. Our server was able to help us with any questions we had and when the food arrived it did not disappoint. Bold flavors and so delicious I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We celebrated my birthday dinner and had a wonderful experience from start to finish. Our server was passionate, fun and very informed about the food and their creative cocktails and we had so much fun talking about the menu. We ended up choosing the semolina bread with crab dip (amazing!!!), roasted squash (served with whipped feta - OMG!), smoked spare ribs with a snap pea slaw and the whole striped bass to share. My son ordered the kids chicken and waffles which was super creatively served with waffle bites in a waffle cone, along with fries. The food came out perfectly, super flavorful, creative and we just loved everything we had. We will definitely be back to try other delicious menu choices. And soon!"}
{"text":"Sounds like brunch is good here but dinner was not great!   I was excited because the Phoenix Times said the chef  was great.  Trying too hard.  We had a pheasant salad, bones in it and not good.  The cowboy steak was fatty. Go to steak house to get a great steak. Scallops were good.  Beets ok. Desert just ok.  Nothing was great!  Drinks, bread were good and service was good.  Started to get busy so not sure service would be great.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"We have been going to the Phoenician for Christmas buffet for several years. So very disappointed with their decision to no longer have this event. They offered a Christmas brunch this year with very average tasting food. The New York steak was served rare. We asked for it to be medium well and they returned it seared and still raw. The sea bass was over salted. Dessert was a bread pudding that was dried out. We won't be returning to the Mowry & Cotton ever again. Our waiter told us several people were expecting the same Christmas brunch as years before and like us were terribly disappointed."}
{"text":"In the glossy pages of \"So Scottsdale\" magazine,  Mowry & Cotton looks like an upscale,  trendy,  and can't miss addition to the Scottsdale restaurant scene.  The reality of dining there however falls far short.    The food is only average with too many better local choices to make.  The service too is just adequate.  Even with reservations you will wait for a table.  There is a sense of chaos that the place is just one dropped plate from being out of control.   From multiple unbussed tables,  to serving stands randomly collected,  and disorganized drink stands,  the place is just unbecoming a resort like the Phoenician.  The one redeeming quality is the setting.  The property is still beautiful,  even in the midst of major rennovation. Go for the views and not the food or service.    With resort prices for moderly adequate food,  Mowry & Cotton will struggle when the tourists are gone as the locals aren't likely to frequent here."}
{"text":"Heard good things about this place finally got to come in for lunch and got one of their burgers was expecting much but I was pretty impressed really nice size Burger juicy at that love the condiments I think they're pickles Our House made which is really good Dario Lee was pretty good as well salad was okay who got the chips I also had their s'more pie which is really good could have been little hotter but Louie gooey goodness might just go back for that I said at the bar bartender was awesome explain different things on the menu you got to talking talking about different drinks they had four things are made made me feel at home make it was slow but definitely will go back again"}
{"text":"My family and I came here for a birthday brunch for my sister. PS: if you tell them there's a birthday when you make the reservation , they will have a plate of chocolate strawberries with \"happy birthday (insert name here)\" made beforehand.  At first impression, the place had a great open decor. There was live music on the patio (where we sat) and the service, despite some other reviews, was great. However, the service did go down in quality as the meal went on.   We got the patio platter (the 10-course meal for a minimum of 3 people). Since we had 4 people, we also order an additional starter and entree while 3 did the patio platter. My goodness, was there enough food! It was actually too much...we ended up having tons of leftover. While the quantity was there, the overall quality lacked in my opinion. The pork shank that I got in addition was fairly dry. We don't love blue cheese (our fault for not asking to remove this), and the kale salad had it as a main ingredient. The shrimp and grits was a mix of very garlicy (if you have the grits by itself) and salty (if you had the shrimp by itself). The donuts was presented in a fun way where you could drizzle it with your choice of topping, but the donuts weren't quite worth the calories. The best one were the steak tacos and the chocolate dessert. If I come again, that would be what i get. Because we did elected to do the preset menu, things arrived in four separate waves. I'm not sure if the waiter didn't want to rush us or whatnot, but he was seldom seen. Also, when I went into the dining area to look for him, I didn't find him.  Lastly, we sat on the patio. There were birds of course. The problem was that the station area with water and other drinks closest to us didn't have a napkin or something covering them. The birds, as you can see in the picture, were all around it. Clearly, this is a sanitation issue. Also, one of the servers' assistant collected our dirty plates and left them on a tray by the station...which only drew more attention from the birds...not ok. This knocked it down to a 2 star for me."}
{"text":"I can't RAVE enough about this place! I held my birthday party there on May 22nd and the experience was AMAZING!  Let's begin with the custom birthday cake. I requested a dark chocolate cake with fresh raspberries to serve 10 people. I was blown away when my cake was presented to me. Not only was it the MOST DELICIOUS CAKE I've ever tasted, it served 20 so there was plenty to take home.   Every single item on the dinner menu is worth trying so I can't single out any one item, but if you go there for lunch please order the beef brisket sandwich.  I can't wait to return. My new favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant with impeccable food. The Chef Tandy Peterson works magic with the menu.   The view of The Phoenician's swimming pool makes the setting that much more memorable. We went in the evening and the lighting was stunning.   Don't miss if you are visiting Scottsdale or Phoenix."}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed breakfast two mornings in a row here. The food was fresh and the menu was perfect. Great options but not too many so it wasn't difficult to make a choice. The service was also great.  The highlight was watching a hawk chase away the local birds from attempting to sneak food off of the tables. There was a service called Falcon Force which involved a friendly bird trainer who walked around the outdoor seating area with the goal of guiding his Harris Hawk named \"Tony Hawk\" to free the area of flying pests.  If I am ever in the area again I would definitely dine here again."}
{"text":"Solid brunch spot. This is a nicely decorated spot within the Phoenician resort. We sat outside and the misters were powerful enough to keep up with the heat. Our service was excellent. Our server, Myron, was absolutely stellar. The coffee was good and got topped off frequently. We shared the donuts which were good (the Bavarian cream inside was amazing). I went for lighter fare with the granola and yogurt dish. It was delicious and I appreciated that it was more yogurt than granola. The SO had the BLT (a breakfast version with eggs). I had a bite and it was very good, but probably not my favorite of that type of sandwich. At the same time it was tasty enough that I would consider ordering it in the future. Overall, this is definitely a nice spot for brunch, especially if you want to feel like you're not in the middle of the city."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best brunch I've had in Arizona. First off, the staff is incredibly friendly and highly knowledgeable about each item on the menu. They make great recommendations based on your personal tastes and will follow up to make sure everything is as you expected. The brisket Benedict was OUT OF THIS WORLD, and that's coming from a true Benedict connoisseur. The pork plate was a wonderful variety of meat from a whole hog but the real star of this dish is the crumpets, they're truly delicious. The Brussel sprouts were cooked perfectly. The sorbet mimosas are the perfect way to cap the meal. I highly recommend the passion fruit!  Outside, they have a falconer who is very friendly and will show you his falcon and explain all the intricacies or taking care of such a majestic animal.   Overall, I would highly recommend Mowry and Cotton to anybody passing through Phoenix!"}
{"text":"A wonderful experience.  Great food and wonderful service.  The staff was extremely friendly all the way from valet service, hostess, and our waitress.  They had great vegetarian options - we had a couple in our party and they really enjoyed the food. Hand crafted pizzas were amazingly tasty."}
{"text":"Mowry & Cotton is a restaurant located inside the newly renovated Phoenician Resort in Scottsdale AZ. I attended the yelp elite event there last week and had a great time. All staff received us very well, the appetizers, deserts and drinks were soooo good! See photos of meals & views. Definitely recommend this place! Thank you Yelp and Hailey P for the invite"}
{"text":"Tried it with a couple friends. Not quite sure what it wants to be. Tapas? Not really. Family style? Not so much. Food was hit and miss. Flatbread was great, pheasant was mediocre. Cocktail menu was okay, though a bit on the sweet side. Won't try it again."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to take part of their brunch along with either a Groupon/coupon that enabled us a free flight of Fro-Mosas with our meals.  Fro-Mosas are basically a scoop of sorbet topped with champagne.  (Yum) We ordered the theMonkey Bread, the breakfast tacos and the salmon salad.  The monkey break was just okay. I remember growing up making monkey bread and M&C's didn't quite compare, but it was still pretty good. The breakfast tacos were AMAZING!!!  (So much so that we tried to go back the next morning just for the tacos but we weren't able to get a reservation!) the tacos are stuffed with a fried egg, steak, little bit of guacamole and I'm probably forgetting some other ingredients... Last we ordered the salmon garbanzo salad which was pretty good. The dressing had an interesting flavor that i couldn't quite pinpoint what it was.  I've never really eaten beets before and that was a treat for me!"}
{"text":"First let's fix the lighting issue.... simple, just turn the dimmers DOwN! At least for dinner!! Way too bright if you sit inside. The patio seating, which is plentiful thank you, with heaters, thanks again, is a better choice.  Next the furniture.... shameful for the PHONECIAN?!!! Feels like you're in a run of the mill coffee shop. Again a simple fix.  On to the food. Everything we had was tasty enough to order again!   First the Mussels... big portion, plenty of sauce for dipping, w/ bits of chorizo... great! Next the Whole roasted Seabass. Perfectly cooked w/ tantalizing flavors, great! We also had the buttermilk buns with spreads and pickled veg. And with just this and a bottle of bubbly we were stuffed and had to leave with no dessert which we are totally going to have on our next visit.... maybe first!  We saw reviews on open table about poor service. Just ask for Sarah, knowledgeable about every detail on the menu, timing was perfect and she even brought a lap blanket for the wife 'cause it's kinda chilly in there too.... bring a sweater.  HEY MOWRY - fix the lighting and the furnishings issues and you'll be 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"I sampled this restaurant during Restaurant Week 2018. To my great surprise the restaurant was empty at 6:30pm. The ambience and interior design  are both rustic and chic. The restaurant has a variety of seating options, a lot of tables for date nights, families and even a private room for a special event! We ordered the meatballs and chop salad to start, which both delivered great flavor.  $15 cocktails were on a weak side.  Hanger steak was the star with a mushroom garnish.  To finish this elevated dining experience we had bread pudding with ice cream. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Awful restaurant! We live in the neighborhood, so we frequent the Phoenician. Because we enjoy J&G so much, we have given this restaurant three tries. The food is awful and the service is subpar. The unique thing is that this restaurant feels as if it should be better, yet it fails each time. Great resort, but restaurant."}
{"text":"Mowry & Cotton did not disappoint.  Starting with the beautiful view from our outside table.  Started with fresh kale juice which was good with a hint of ginger.  And yes, you could not tell it was kale.  My husband had a mixed green salad whch was fresh and delicious with tasty Toppings and a mild dressing.  I had the citrus plate offset by dates, pomegranates and pistachios.  A lovely, healthy starter.  My husband had the breakfast tacos with hanger steak and fried egg. He wished he would have skipped the egg as the steak had a wonderful flavor.  Next time egg on the side.  I had the crab avacado egg brushetta.   I loved it.  Scrammbled eggs cooked perfectly.  Had to take half home.  This is a great place for a special occasion.  Somewhat pricey for everyday."}
{"text":"Came here for a Yelp Elite BBQ event and had a really awesome experience.  The 3 food stations were beautiful displays of meaty greatness.  The taco station featured a whole smoked hog which was very similar to Chinese whole roasted pig so I liked it very much.  The meat was succulent and the skin was very crispy.  I would have liked it salted a bit since I ate it by itself instead of building my own taco with it.  The second station featured a delicious smoked salmon with some interesting toppings including pomegranate, rather dry bbq chicken, and amazing buttery shishito peppers.  I had 3 plates of shishito peppers as it was my favorite item of the night!  The third station had very tender ribs and brisket but they weren't very juicy.  They definitely needed the barbecue sauce to wash them down.  Overall taste was quite good except the dessert station.  There were Whoopi pies, some peach cornbread, and a brownie with a custard-like layer on top.  While the presentation was pretty, they were stale and tasteless.  The service was amazing however!  The staff constantly cleared our many plates and it was as if they feared the water would fall below an inch of the rim of our glasses.  The event gave me the impression it was a bbq restaurant but upon checking their online menu, it seemed like a typical mid-range American restaurant inside of a hotel."}
{"text":"We stopped in shortly after they opened last year to check the place out and enjoy a cocktail on the patio overlooking the pool.  I enjoyed The Boss cocktail - sparkling wine with strawberry and thoroughly enjoyed it.  We'll definitely come back in for a meal and see what all the buzz is about with the food."}
{"text":"Mowry & Cotton, as with the former ILTerrazzo, has a distinct home field advantage being located within The Phoenician.  From the moment you drive through the expansive grounds towards the entrance, you are then greeted by the well-mannered and eager valets as you disembark from your vehicle.  And you walk through the glass doors, and are warmly greeted by James.  For as long as we have been coming here, it seems as if James has always been here to usher guests in, and direct them towards their ultimate destination within the hotel.  James stands tall, friendly, professional and respectful. He represents the human equivalent of a digital personal assistant, directing those that may be directionally impaired or are uninitiated.  We've been to IL Terrazzo countless times; therefore, the new establishment that occupies its former place was a known quantity to us. A short ride on the elevator, and we were greeted by a more modern and functionally accessible entrance to the restaurant.  It was later on a Sunday morning when we arrived, and the place was bustling with many groups of guests. The hostesses greeted us and promptly directed us to our table facing the terrace. Providing us with a nice view of the premises, as we had gotten accustomed to over the years.  Nolan, our server, introduced himself on cue. He promptly introduces himself, asks a few questions, and proceeds to take our order.  The atmosphere was vibrant for a Sunday morning; especially with the background accompaniment of the DJ's mashups.  We ordered the House made Hog Breakfast Board, for starters. What an amazing and mouthwatering combination of freshly prepared breakfast favorites. This is a must for those that desire to get acclimated to chef's masterful culinary expression.   If that weren't enough, my wife opted to order the Chicken & Waffles. These aren't the Lolo's chicken and waffles kind. This particular dish is visually striking; as well as, being scrumptious.   I ordered the Buttered Buns. The Buns were freshly baked, and the rest of the accoutrements simply enhanced their flavor.  From start to finish, we had nothing but a first-rate experience.   Mowry & Cotton is certainly a welcome replacement to IL Terrazzo, and an outstanding addition to The Phoenician hotel."}
{"text":"A hidden gem tucked inside an oasis in the desert. Tandy created an exceptional menu flush with an amazing collection of flavors.  The buttermilk buns, hanger steak, charred tuna, smoked spare ribs, flatbreads, BBQ beats and the made fresh donut dessert (boom) and on and on....The staff works hard to deliver great service.   Dino, Jacqueline and Ahmet were friendly and personal. Made the experience complete.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Not sure where all the hate is coming from for this place. We had an awesome dinner experience here. I'm wondering if people aren't understanding the concept of the menu. The dishes are meant to be ordered family-style and shared with the table, and they also come out as they are prepared, creating a stream of food and a prolonged eating experience. If you are looking for your standard, quick app/entree/dessert dinner then this is not the place to get it.  The food was universally good. The buttermilk buns are fantastic. They have a deliciously soft texture and are served with two awesome butters. The brussels sprouts and roasted spring onion were good, but the crispy potatoes stole show on the veg side of things. Shatteringly crisp outsides with creamy insides coupled with a fantastic sauce made these extraordinary.  From the fish section, we tried the salmon and the shrimp, and both were very good. From the meat section, the hanger steak had a really interesting blueberry marinade that was as unexpected as it was good. But what really stole the show was the pheasant. Beautifully crisp, fatty skin and a sweet, salty seasoning made this my favorite dish.  This place is perfect for a larger group that's willing to share as you get to sample a lot of different dishes, which is exactly what the menu was designed to do. You also get plenty of time to socialize as a stream of dishes come out of the kitchen.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Just had dinner there! First,  service was out of this world! Nicole is fantastic. She was friendly and knowledgeable ! Israel was great at being there anytime without being overbearing! The food was creative and delicious.  Highly recommend the cauliflower and flank steak among many others. The view is a killer! Bravo."}
{"text":"Mowry and Cotton is a sort of New American Restaurant located in the Phoenician (a luxury resort). I'll note in my review that you want to go to the second level because the man at the gate incorrectly told us the first floor. You can get in at level one but you'd have to walk past the restaurant around the outside.   I didn't get the western theme this restaurant is suppose to have but the name Mowry & Cotton is of a tell Tail of Cowboys named Mowry & Cotton that settled in Phoenix to open an upscale saloon that was friendly and inviting.  The lunch and dinner menus offer a lot of variety. You are in a luxury resort and the food I tried is high quality and detailed.  I had the Jidori Chicken Sandwich. My sandwich was PACKED with lots of juicy flavorful chicken. It had a delicious apple bourbon sauce on it. It was suppose to contain fennel and I can't say I didn't get any but my sandwich only contained two tiny shreds. As delicious as the sandwich was I think if it had maybe at least a teaspoon of fennel it would have been much better. My plate also came with these really delicious pickles in a tiny dish. The pickles were made of cauliflower, blueberries, onions and cucumbers. They were gently spiced and pickled. I picked salad as my side option so I could save room for dessert. BTW- the sandwich was very large so you might want to take half home like I did.  My husband had the Smoked Brisket Sandwich. It was a very detailed sandwich and had more going on with it than the Jidori Chicken I was served. The sandwich contained nicely prepared brisket, house made pickles, Grilled Swiss Chard and this really delicious Carolina Mustard. His plate came with the same pickles I described above and he paid $4.00 extra for the Crispy Fries Option that were baked and fried twice. The fries were delicious with a creamy interior but the fries they served us weren't crisp. Our waiter did offer to get us another batch of them but we declined because the fries were delicious anyway.  The Dessert was out of the ordinary! (YOU MUST SEE PICTURE) We tried the Apple Crumble. They made blackstrap maple ice-cream look JUST LIKE A REAL APPLE! and served it with apples and an oat crumble. I have to say it wasn't like any dessert that anyone else serves. It was beautiful to look at and almost like dessert for people who don't like sweets. It almost wasn't sweet or spiced. Just mostly natural tasting. Really really different!  They had a team of people waiting on us that were very efficient and friendly.  The woman I spoke to on the phone said I could use my Scottsdale preferred Card here and I did tell her I had this year's card with  II Terrazzo in the spot where next years card list Mowry & Cotton. She said they would gladly accept this year's card that ends in November. But that was a different story when I ate at the restaurant.  Not a perfect experience but overall very good. I also note that this restaurant just recently opened at the time of this review."}
{"text":"Went for afternoon lunch on the patio with my daughter for Mother's Day weekend! What a gorgeous atmosphere located by the pool. We enjoyed the chicken pesto flatbread with a couple of delicious cocktails! Our server was very friendly and helpful with our choices! It was really cool because they had a falcon on the premises for guests to admire while they dined or swam! My daughter loved the Phoenician and Mowry & Cotton! She wants to return her next visit!"}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere, outside seating was full but we still had great seats inside. The food was great, the ratio was a little off on the Buddha bowl, would have liked to see more granola however the dragon fruit gelato was a nice (cool) surprise. Everyone seemed to enjoy their food a lot. Reason for taking away stars: drink orders for myself and another person were forgot (reminded the waiter after the food came), they forgot kids menus for the younger kids. The older kid wanted to order an app as the breakfast item and was pressured by the waiter to order an entree as well. One of the kids yogurts was brought out just plain, missing the fruit and other toppings. It was really hard to get a waiters attention and just had to wait while missing items etc."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here, have had two breakfast meals previously and first lunch experience was great.   Flatbreads yummy, ahi tuna sandwich on lettuce leafs fantastic,   Lamb Tacos tasty!   Chicken bowl over the top.   Fresh is the main theme here everything tastes so fresh.   Great cocktails as well!  I do not understand the average stars.  Service great.   Good alternative to your 3 meal a day typical resort restaurant."}
{"text":"I was in last night with friends for cocktails. M&C takes over the space formerly occupied by Il Terazzo on the ground level of the resort.  As you walk in the bar area is to the right and in front of you, dining room to the left and a big outdoor patio.  The service was friendly and the Western themed-vibe was explained to us.  We all ordered drinks from their cocktail list.  My Bourbon & Boujee was very good with bourbon, maple and brown sugar syrup, bitters and a piece of bacon for garnish.  The food menu looked pretty good but we didn't have anything to eat.  The biggest drawback was the design of the bar.  It was smallish and had a cold and unwelcoming feel to it.  Maybe a couple of area rugs under the two sitting areas inside by the windows, get rid of those gastly big light bulb lamps that my friend hit her head on and turn down the overhead lighting a little."}
{"text":"Really good experience! I wasn't sure if coming here was a good idea since this place has only 3.5 star average BUT I have it a try and I must say this is definitely a 4.5 or 5 star restaurant. My dinning experience was amazing!! Customer service was excellent and the ambience was relaxing  recommend this"}
{"text":"We are staying at the Phoenician for our stay here in Scottsdale and have been to this restaurant several times.  I'd say it's best for breakfast. I recommend the avocado toast, eggs benedict, or the stuffed French toast if you're looking for something sweeter.  They charge 4 dollars for a very small cup of orange juice, which in my opinion is a rip-off, because there are not refills.  The dinner was pretty good, but not anything out of this world. They do not serve complimentary bread, you have to pay about $10 for it. If I recommend anything for dinner, I'd recommend the krispy potatoes (side item)."}
{"text":"Wanted to check out brunch on their patio before the weather gets too warm. Though service was spotty, the food was beautiful and delicious.  I wanted to make a 10:30 reservation, but was told they don't take reservations before 11am. When I asked why since the website said they opened at 10:30, I received a confusing response about the reservation policy and actual business hours. Was told they could probably seat us, but no guarantee. When we arrived, just a few minutes before 10:30, the patio was already full, with several tables at the end of their meal. Very confusing.... Despite all that, we were seated right away, but then our server ghosted. Luckily, the patio falcon force kept us entertained while we waited. We eventually flagged someone down and things got back on track. From there, things were much smoother.   Recommend ordering a bunch of things to share.  - Citrus with dates and pomegranates were beautiful and so sweet - Bruschetta with fluffy eggs, chunks of avocado, and cheese didn't have much of the promised crab, but was still tasty. The thick slice of buttery toast made this really filling. - Roasted brussels sprouts- a huge pile of nicely charred halves served over a just-sweet-enough soy dressing and topped with beautiful bonito wisps. The pieces of pickled cauliflower balance it out perfectly - Citrus salmon salad- I didn't notice any dill green goddess dressing or citrus flavors, but the dish (cucumber, poached salmon, roasted beets, avo, cabbage) was still tasty. Dressing definitely would have brought it together. - Breakfast tacos- yum! These were filling with meat so tender it melted in your mouth  Overall- definitely a good place to brunch, especially if you have a group that likes to share."}
{"text":"We decided to give this restaurant a try to celebrate my fathers 88th birthday. We sat out on the magnificent terrace (with heaters) and had one of the most enjoyable dinning experiences in Scottsdale. Where to begin? Our waiter Tyler was so pleasant and professional. He recommended a few dishes and we ended up trying 16 I'm total for 5 of us. The quality of the ingredients, the presentation and taste was faultless. We all found the dishes to be reasonably priced and each one was absolute heaven. We chose 5 vegetables and it's the first time in AZ that the Brussels have been cooked perfectly. Blanched and then grilled. The bison carpaccio is so delicate. The lamb tacos truly scrumptious. The bass was a true highlight. All is so fresh that it is hard to really have a winner! The chicken flatbread was my mother's preferred choice (she only eats chicken!!!) Upon parking they asked the reason for the visit and one of the 5 desserts arrived with a personal birthday message. Wonderful touch to a truly magical evening. Thank you to everyone and especially the Chef who took the time to come out and meet us. I think she was truly impressed by the quantity of food we ordered. She's worked under Brinkley but I truly believe the food on offer tonight was far superior to her place of training."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite brunch spots!! I have been here at least 5 times in the last 5 months and it's consistently delicious!!! I haven't been here for dinner so I'm not sure why they have such mediocre reviews. The fromosa flight is always a good choice, especially on warm summer days. The food is also very flavorful and great when sharing with a  big group. Most memorable dish was the chicken and waffles, it had a very memorable smoky flavor, and the syrup complimented it very well. Aside from the food, the atmosphere is pretty cool,. They have a huge outdoor patio with tons of sunshine. If you are lucky they \"hawk man\" will come around with his hawk. They hawk's caretaker is very knowledgeable and answers all questions regarding his hawk."}
{"text":"This restaurant seems like it is trying way too hard to be some sort of trendy. We stayed at the phonecian and so ate at this restaurant multiple times purely out of convenience. The brunch had no items I actually wanted to order and when it was brought out was disappointing. Also, the eggs seemed fake and cold. For dinner we got the rolls, cod and salmon, all of which were just so so. I would not order again. It seems like they are trying very hard to be trendy and loosing focus of good food that people actually like to eat. For such a great hotel you would think they would have better dining options. That being said, the staff was great. Very friendly and knowledgeable, although I felt bad for them having to wear those outfits."}
{"text":"This place is a disgrace the service is beyond awful and the staff know it. It takes at least 20 minutes to get someone's attention upon seating. Prepare for long waits and zero attention to customer service."}
{"text":"Visited for restaurant week, food and service both excellent, good value for the money. very personable staff. Ordered veal meatballs and salad as starters, both were very good. We both ordered the hanger steak rare and it was properly prepared and nicely plated. Very tasty. Deserts were Bread pudding (cornbread and chipotle ice cream) and Lemon meringue pie both of which were not to our taste. We would definitely return in the future and highly recommend."}
{"text":"Resort breakfast with great vegetarian and vegan options for us. Though the classic breakfast entrees are predominant there are solid options for vegetarian. For me, blueberry and banana pancakes. For Jamie a Buddha bowl. And fresh fruit!  Awesome!"}
{"text":"They need to go back to the drawing board. For a great hotel the food and service is on par with Howard Johnson. I don't need to hear how much the staff lives the food and that it is the best food they have ever had."}
{"text":"Amazing ambience, friendly staff, and unforgettable menu! The dishes at Mowry and Cotton are comfort food with a unique twist. Every detail of the dish was intricately thought out and the flavors blend together so well. My group had the pleasure of having quite the spread but my recommendations are the buns, hanger steak, tuna, crispy potatoes, & spring onions! Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"Nope. Try somewhere else. Chris the bar tender was skillful but very involved in washing glasses. Peter, the assistant, after water service was nonexistent. David our waiter was a great orator. He even explained the dish that was not available. To the food. The bread was terrific. The muscles were well prepared. The snapper was very nicely prepared, flavorful and nicely prepared. The crab dip was a bit over cooked and dry. I really enjoyed the brisket soup. Our table service was abysmally slow. Empty glasses decorated our table for ten to 15 minutes at a time. The pace was deliberate which would be enjoyable if our empty plates were removed and the drinks consistently refilled.  We were treated to a complementary desert for our anniversary. In summary, food 4 stars, atmosphere 5 stars, service 0 stars. Or \"Come for the bread and stay for the soup\" then leave."}
{"text":"This place is horrible . Food is not cooked well. There was glass found in our drink and management did nothing about it. Phoenician needs to have a better restaurant then this place."}
{"text":"I want so badly to leave a great review, and the ambiance is beautiful! Unfortunately the service missed the mark. We were there for one hour, because the service was so slow that we left to go to another restaurant. Our server was nice and genuine, but it took over 20 minutes to get one cocktail. We were waiting for over 15 minutes trying to order, when our group just decided to go somewhere else. Sad, because it could have been circumstance or maybe our server was swamped."}
{"text":"Great breakfast! Had breakfast here every day during our stay at the resort. Ordered something different every day and enjoyed it all. Everything was prepared perfectly and was very fresh. Staff was also great, remembered our names and what we liked."}
{"text":"A friend recommended we check this place out. The Phoenician Resort is  beautiful so we sat on the patio that looks over the pool. Started with the buttery delicious rolls and then had the Fish, potatoes and cauliflower dish. Finished the lovely dinner with an apple cobbler. I like that the menu is designed to share a few items so you can try a little of everything as the potions are not too large but you will leave very satisfied"}
{"text":"My brother and I visited for an event a couple of months ago, and were very impressed by the quality of their BBQ - beef, pork chicken and fish - all were amazing.  The service was attentive and friendly, and the setting overlooking the pool wasn't so bad either.  We will be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant has fabulous food and drinks.  The fish tacos were perfect!  The whole fish comes to the table and you make your own little tacos for communal dining.  This restaurant would definitely be worth a visit to even if you aren't staying at the Phoenician.  When you go to the restaurant, your parking will be validated.  The ambiance is amazing!"}
{"text":"GROSS LACK OF INTEGRITY   This is only my second yelp review. I only post if there is something seriously wrong with the establishment. So here's my story:   Had a reservation for party of 7 to celebrate my mother's birthday. Saw this restaurant on Phoenix magazine Best of 2017-18. Appetizers were great. Highly recommend the biscuits and crab spin dip. Entrees were unfortunately underwhelming. However, the food is not why I'm writing this.   Upon receiving the bill I noticed a large gratuity percentage of 25%. It doesn't state the actual numerical percentage, having been a former server for several years I just did quick math in my head. I didn't know that our server, LUIS, was standing behind me. I laughed out loud with a spontaneous \"woah\" reaction. Got my Card out and paid the bill. Luis came back and said he changed the gratuity back to the normal 18%. This immediately tells me that he knew I saw the previously overcharged amount. He offered no explanation. I paid the bill.   Spoke with a manager asking what's the customary gratuity, he stated 18%. So how did I get 25. Luis had to of changed it manually he stated. He then said it's the computer screen malfunction and isn't registering inputs correctly and left it at that. No sorry, no deep apology for a very poor experience. He did not care. Upset I spoke to luis aggressively, making sure his dishonesty was recognized.   It's my belief that Luis stereotyped me as a young guy that could not afford the bill and therefore could not afford the tip. I would have gladly tipped my standard 20- 22% but instead he got the 18. Overall probably the worst experience I've ever had service wise at a restaurant.  There was also no acknowledgement about my mother's birthday even though it was mentioned twice, at the time the reservation was made and when someone called to confirm the reservation."}
{"text":"Very expensive for what you get but the ambience is great and the Phoenician is beautiful. Our waiter was very attentive but the food was so-so. Spare ribs were dry and a little on the tough side, dungenous crab dip was fishy, and the cauliflower had a rich creamy sauce on it and is basically a head of cauliflower plopped on your table. We much preferred Il Terazzo, the restaurant that used to be in this space"}
{"text":"We stopped after work in on a slow Thursday evening for some drinks and snack and left (disappointed) after one drink. If a local is going to deal with resort prices, you should at least get resort-level service.  The hostess wasn't warm or friendly and neither was our server. Additionally, service was slow and we didn't get water or napkins until we requested them.  The cocktail/mixed drink options seemed limited and sugary. The drinks we chose were fine but not spectacular and not sizable.  There weren't any \"happy hour\" specials.   Our only highlight (which wasn't even that great) of the evening was their signature Buttermilk Bun. It was tasty and large enough to share for the table. However, the specialty butters (citrus and fig) weren't all that special or flavorful.  Based on this experience, we will not bother returning for a full meal."}
{"text":"This restaurant has some serious issues. Whether it be seating walk up guests while making guests with reservations wait. Or the half hour wait for drinks. This restaurant  needs to get it together as the food is fairly good. But the price =/= the service."}
{"text":"Literally the worst service. It's $6 to park. The hostess was so rude to my gf and I, there was literally nobody in the restaurant and they wouldn't seat us. FOOD IS AVERAGE. DO NOT COME HERE"}
{"text":"Great drinks, amazing food, and super fast service.  I came here with a group of about 18 on a Saturday night. They set us at a large table already put together on the patio. Everything who worked there was very friendly and helpful. Our drink order was taken and delivered quickly, as was the food. I was very impressed at the speed at which the kitchen put great food out.  As for my favorites - you definitely need to try the meatballs, chicken flatbread, old fashioned, crispy potatoes, and the ribeye."}
{"text":"Mowry and Cotton with an interesting name and history behind the name of the restaurant.  Chef Tandy Peterson has assembled quite an awesome menu.  Our waiter Myron was very good and offered a indept explanation and recommendation of favorite dishes.  Lily the hostess almost ruined the entire evening. Of course I understand that a large portion of the seating is outside in the patio by the pool and what happens on Valentine's Dinner, it rains. So Lilly sits us at a table in the bar, I ask her if there are other options not in the bar, her reply is you can sit outside (in the rain and cold) or at the bar counter. So table in the bar it is. The table was by the entrance and hostess podium, so we see everyone who comes in and the next 8 couples get seated in the dining area within an hour. I almost blew my top, luckily my wife calmed me down or I would have confronted Lily the hostess. I was so pissed off!! Fortunately the food and Myron were incredible or I would have questioned Lily why everyone else was being seated in the dining room and we were not given that option. I made the reservations through Open Table about a month and a half ago for a special Valentine's Dinner with my wife.  Ordered the Cowboy Ribeye, the Grilled Black Cod, Crispy Potatoes and Apple Crumble  Cowboy Ribeye is prepared in smoked blue cheese, onions, pepita and chimicura. Cooked as requested medium rare. Looked like it Tomahawk Ribeye cut and very tender and delicious.   The Grilled Black Cod is prepared with parsnip, spinach, wildflower honey, cashews and finger lime. Very very tender and soft fish, just melts in your mouth and an awesome sauce to choose if you want to dip it in it.  Very impressive  Crispy Potatoes with Chorizo, Horesradish, Tomato Brava Hot Sauce. Potatoes are very crispy exactly as advertised and the way I like potatoes. The mixture is just plain awesome.  To top it off, we ordered the Apple Crumble which is served with ice cream. The Apple Crumble is served with apple, caramel and molasses. The incredible part is the ice cream. When served, it looks like an apple, with the Apple Crumble, but it is ice cream shaped and painted to look like a peach and the stem is made of chocolate. WOW!  Towards the end of the dinner, we see Michael Bidwell, owner of the AZ Cardinals leaving from the dining room. So if the owner of the AZ Cardinals is having his Valentine's Dinner here then we must have made a good choice.  Besides Lily the hostess, this is an incredible restaurant based on the food and service.  I will give this truly a 4.5 Stars with the half deduction of the hostess, but overall a 5 star."}
