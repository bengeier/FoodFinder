{"text":"Good food. They're going to ask if you want the bbq chicken bun for 2.00. Don't get it. It's really small and only worth a dollar maybe at most."}
{"text":"Yummy.  My daughter was throwing a tantrum so we were unable to eat at the business and even cold I enjoyed my lunch!  I will be going back when my Hawaiian BBQ craving hits!"}
{"text":"Food is very good but I'm extremely dissatisfied with there cheep credit card reader. 1st time I visited there, CC reader said invalid pin. So I left and went to bank, nothing wrong with my card or pin #. Today I went back and had same result, pin # invalid. I left restaurant after showing cashier the cash in my wallet and I had enough to buy many meals. My problem is they have made no effort to upgrade system. Card worked fine at Sprouts 5 mins later and then at Fry's."}
{"text":"Food is not bad, but compared to the ones I had in Kona n Hilo, they are not the same. Maybe just a different version?  Customer service from my cashier, the old man on the video, Stanley? is one of the worse I had (I use Groupon, and he had a hard time with his Groupon apps). Very long story short, it was straightened up but I am disappointed on how it was handled.   I hope they figure something out to avoid this in the future or just stop Groupon altogether to avoid further issues.  The younger cashier, was very apologetic about it, and did try to made it up with exceptional customer service, thus save them from one star, I hate giving locally own business one star anyway.  All things said n done, I wish them the best, since I like locally owned eatery."}
{"text":"Really good I love the food here I've tried  Bbq beef, Bbq chicken, chicken Katsu, curry chicken and they're all really good I'll be trying other items later."}
{"text":"Pretty good and prices are fair.  Got the Kalua pig and Chicken Katsu combo (with an Aloha Pass-O-Guava of course) and it was ok.  Kalua pig was same as in Hawaii and the Katsu was nice and crispy.  Didn't care for the Katsu sauce but everyone has their own opinion on what Katsu sauce should taste like.  Rice was good and sticky but the mac salad wasn't that great.  All in all, a solid place if you're jonesing for Hawaiian food in Chandler.  Lunch wait is a bit long (more than 20 mins) so go early or later if you're low on time."}
{"text":"Super nice folks. Mesa location cooks better than the Chandler one, meats are just more tender, including the kalbi. BBQ Mix of meats -- chicken, beef, and short rib, over cabbage soaked in meat juices, served with obligatory two scoops of rice, one of a delicious mac salad, and I hate mac salad, makes for a crazy tasty carbolicious meal. Love it."}
{"text":"I thought this place was just \"Ok\", the portions was my main issue. I ordered the chicken katsu. I usually expect larger amounts when you come to a Hawaiian joint but I left still hungry. The food was good though except for the cabbage, tasted weird, but the service was good. I won't be coming back here because I'm a big eater and I spent $10.00 plus left a small tip but again still hungry. I guess I'll stick with Leo's Island BBQ in the west valley, those portions are Ginormous!"}
{"text":"Great food Great service Try the Chicken Katsu"}
{"text":"Last minute late night craving, I wanted kalbi and some rice. I checked this place and it is really close to the hospital where I am staying. I called at 9:30pm to see if I can order to go. He was nice and said not a problem.  Looked good, kalbi, cabbage, rice and white Mac salad.   I cut up a piece and tried the end piece, I tasted something odd. Like some chemical not the sauce. My fiancé tried and he really liked it. I thought it was weird so I cut up middle part of kalbi and it was totally different flavor than the end piece I had.  Rest of the kalbi was good. I don't know how the end piece has different flavor than the middle, chemical flavor, I have no idea.  I guess I will try again but chicken next time."}
{"text":"Food was very hot and fresh.  Very tasty as well.  Portions were small for the price though. Can't compare with Ono though. Lady was nice"}
{"text":"Speaking from a Hawaiian, most authentic that I have had in the east valley in a long time.  There are other good places around and this one won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Very good Hawaiian bbq! The meat is seasoned well, and they also have seafood. Reasonable prices, I'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"Came In and ordered an egg roll and crab puffs to go.....28min later I got my order...there were 2 couples in the restaurant and 3 people in the kitchen...I'm a patient person but this is ridiculous....as for the food crab puffs were ok but overpriced and the egg roll was overcooked....not sure if I'd come back to try the entrees...have to plan for an hour of free time to get served. Don't like giving one star so an extra star for cleanliness."}
{"text":"Came in and tried the katsu chicken, my friend suggested me you cannot go wrong with it! Can't wait to come back again. Service was great too."}
{"text":"We ordered the spam musubi, bbq beef plate and manapua. The manapua had a lot of meat in it which was great because not all manapuas have enough meat. This place tastes better than other plate lunch restaurants I've eaten at (on the mainland). It would be nice if they offered some kimchi to eat on the side. :)"}
{"text":"The first time I ordered from this restaurant the food was good. This time was the exact opposite it shows that they will give fresh steamed vegetables in their order but it is watery soggy cabbage. Then they put your shrimp on top of that so that becomes soggy as well. Then they put the pasta salad in with all of your hot food so you're cold pasta salad is now hot and gross. The rice was super sticky and dry. will not order from this place again .... After 30 min chat w grubhub the restaurant refused to refund me. ...  WILL NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN."}
{"text":"We ate here a couple of weeks ago and were impressed with the freshness.  Just like Aloha Kitchen on Alma School Road, they don't cook food until it is ordered.  I am originally from Hawaii, therefore, the taste didn't particularly impress me, but the fact that my BBQ chicken was cooked for the perfect amount of time, at the perfect temperature was impressive.  It resulted in very tender, juicy, fully cooked BBQ chicken. I also loved the quietness of the takeout style restaurant. It had a peaceful ambience, notwithstanding they had a fair amount of patrons."}
{"text":"Great customer service and great BBQ. My family loves their food. Little pricey but worth every penny."}
{"text":"The food is filling and inexpensive. The place reminded me of small shops in Hawaii. A quick way to get your Hawaiian fix in the East valley."}
{"text":"i wanted to like this place but have to tell my honest opinion. the bbq chick was ok but the kalbi was just bad. the meat didnt look like it was fully cooked and about 80% was fat. mac salad was awful. I'm not eating there again. being from hawaii, i guess my expectation was high. I was just bad flavor. thx!"}
{"text":"I like this place in regards to what I normally order when getting Hawaiian food. They've got Lau Lau! This is one of my favorite dishes because it incorporates pork and fish and possibly some fat-back wrapped in green leaf and some thicker green leaves. You get to eat the inner leaf and meat and it is very tasty. This place's version was no exception. Came with some kahlua pork, cabbage, rice, and macaroni salad. This dish wasn't very saucy and its not supposed to be. The juices from the various meats and cabbage get soaked up by the rice for good flavor. The guy working (possibly the owner) was very friendly and we plan on returning for more."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday evening  (6pm) and we were the only ones in the place.  Ordered chicken teriyaki plate, chicken katsu and 4 manaupua for myself, hubby & 2 toddlers. Chicken teri was ono! Manapua was huge - much larger than Aloha Kitchen (although not as tasty; we only ate 2 of the 4 ordered due to the size. Both plate lunches came with traditonal sides of mac salad and rice. Katsu sauce tasted a bit like a mild BBQ sauce and I prefer our homemade version over theirs. Overall good value for the price  (less than $30 for my fam of 4).   Downsides? 1. When you order water you get a very small Styrofoam cup that you have to keep refilling from the room temp dispenser with no ice. 2. No diaper changing station in the restrooms.  Will we return? Absolutely.  They will need to get more people in there if they want to stay in business though.  We were there for an hour, on a Saturday, and were the only dine in customers and only 5 others ordered to go."}
{"text":"I was so thrilled to find this place while driving.  I frequently go to their Southern/Dobson location,  but it is so out of the way.  It's the same owners so the food is just as delicious and consistent as their first location.  Their bbq beef is like eating tender bulgogi, so flavorful and just delicious.  It is never burnt or dry like other Hawaiian restaurants in the Valley.   And they have loco moco!!!  That's the next plate lunch I plan to order on my next visit!"}
{"text":"Absolutely worse food I have ever been served. Will not go back. Hard to even comment any further."}
{"text":"Food was plentiful but mediocre. BBQ Beef was the best thing we had. I didn't like the macaroni salad at all, but to be honest I usually don't care for it unless it's from Aloha cafe. Atmosphere- well there isn't much to speak of, but the lady behind the counter was very nice! If your in the area not a bad place to stop for an inexpensive lunch."}
{"text":"I love the chicken here! The macaroni salad complements real nice. The rice isn't anything special, it's rice! But everything blends well taste fresh and reasonably priced. I'd recommend the teriyaki chicken plate! For about $8"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The food is amazing and the staff is very friendly ..I always get the bbq mix at least once a week lol bomb.com"}
{"text":"Since my years in the military and having been surrounded by Hawaiian friends, I have been very much a Hawaiian food fan.  I stumbled upon this place by accident, and love this place.  Spam Musubi is awesome! It takes me back to Hawaii and the many times I visited.  Loco Moco is spot on! Must try! If you love Hawaiian food this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"First of all my own personal experience at this place was excellent and very pleased! I am a bit surprised on what I was reading especially those negative comments and I guess \"you cannot please everyone\" and based on my experienced, I loved this place so much.... The place is very clean, with \"A\" standard ratings, affordable prices, friendly staff (Stephanie, cook) and had a chance to talk to the business owner \"Stanley\" he always make sure how's everything? And making sure that you are satisfied and well taking care of! I love ordering the kalbi dinner plate, spam masubi, vegetable noodle soup, very delicious and something that I can recommend that comes with a macaroni salad on the side and cooked cabbage. I would definitely recommend this place if you and your family is looking for a good place to eat Hawaiian BBQ around town and please see it for yourself! Keep up the good works and thank you so much!"}
{"text":"Great Hawaiian BBQ. Very clean restaurant and friendly staff. I recommend the Chicken Combo & the Loco Moco."}
{"text":"This place is the TRUTH!!!...great food..great staff..the mixed BBQ is for real!!..cheers GHBBQ!!"}
{"text":"This place is so yummy! I think I have had everything on the menu. I have nothing negative to say about their food. Love Golden Hawaiian!"}
{"text":"Food is consistant. While I've had better Hawaiian around here, this is still pretty good. Location is convenient, and people are mostly friendly.  They have a rewards program, which I like. You get free stuff for your birthday, and discounts. And for anyone wondering, they have Pepsi products."}
{"text":"I got the BBQChicken & Kalua Pork combo$9.27.  Staff was very nice food we good also. I make frequent trips to Hawaii and it's not Rainbow drive -in but if you are craving Hawaiian it will satisfy your craving. I'll be back"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken combo, and my husband ordered the pork combo, and a side of potstickers! All of the food was delicious!! (the macaroni salad was a tiny bit bland, but it was such a small portion of the meal, so w/e). We will definitely be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Yes! Hawaiian BBQ I love you so much! I used to work at L&L which I always thought was the king of Hawaiian BBQ however after tasting the cooked cabbage rather than fresh cabbage that L&L and other Hawaiian BBQ joints have I was pleasantly surprised at the difference.  I ended up going with the BBQ Mix and not only was the cooked cabbage an awesome change but the meat was the best I've had. You could tell that it was marinated well as it was so flavorful. And the beef and ribs were so tender that the knife that was provided was not even needed! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"After going to the Hawaiian Festival, we decided to go eat out at a Hawaiian restaurant where it would be shaded and cool. We decided to go try a new Hawaiian restaurant. We ended up going to the Golden Hawaiian BBQ. The restaurant was a bit small and hidden in the parking lot. The water cups were tiny - maybe for children. I had the teriyaki chicken and the meat was deliciously tender. The rice was good and the macaroni salad was yummy. The teriyaki chicken also came on a bed of cabbage, which I thought was nice. We also had the chicken katsu - which came out crispy, moist, and flavorful.  The chicken katsu also came with a dipping sauce, which was pretty good, it tasted like a combination between ketchup and something else. In the inevitable comparison to Aloha Kitchen - I would say the main courses are similar tasting, but the macaroni salad here is not as good."}
{"text":"I expected better from 4 stars. Guess I should have read some of the reviews. Maybe teriyaki would have been the safe choice but I was craving curry. WORST curry I've ever tasted. Unfortunate too because the chicken was cooked perfectly.  The macaroni salad was extremely bland so not much else to report.  The crew was real friendly but the food was anything but."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice now. Both times the food was really good. I have no complaints about this place. Its unfortunate when people jump on yelp to berate a business based on something petty. People need to realize the impact that can have on a small business. The food is good, the place is clean, SUPPORT LOCAL BUSINESS!"}
{"text":"Update September 2016: They changed their noodle soup recipe.  It's now a bowl containing a super bland oil slick.  I've never had my hands get super greasy from a bowl of noodle soup before!  Ate the noodles and wonton and then tossed it.  Very sad.  ---  Popped in here Sunday night.  It was pretty empty, so hopefully they'll get busier as people figure out they are open.  The windows facing Bashas' have blackout screening on them so the restaurant looks closed from the Ray road side.  The older Asian cashier was pleasant.  They were out of noodles, so I couldn't try the wonton \"noodle soup.\"  He also said the noodles were similar to \"lo mein noodles\" when I asked if they were ramen or saimin noodles.  We ordered loco moco, BBQ beef (more teriyaki than shoyu style), and kalbi (Korean BBQ) ribs.  The burger and BBQ beef were seasoned and cooked well, and my mom seemed to enjoy her kalbi.  The rice was properly cooked, though I wasn't a fan of the mac salad or soggy large leafy greens under the entrees.  I wish they had put the loco moco over rice instead of the greens.  One of the eggs in my loco moco was overcooked.  I have two spam musubi in my fridge right now that I am hoping make for a good lunch tomorrow!  The misalignment of the ocean paining in the dining room annoys me (there are visible gaps between the three sections), but their flatscreen tv is VERY nice.  All of the furniture is brand new too, and the place was very clean!  The three entrees plus the musubi came to around $35 after tax, without any drinks.  I'll drop by again to see how their soup measures up to the real deal at Aloha Kitchen."}
{"text":"We tried Golden Hawaiian to cater a birthday party with a Hawaiian theme. We ordered: BBQ beef, teriyaki chicken, kaluha pork, a ton of rice and Mac salad. We ordered a week before our event for approx 20 adults. Ordering was very easy-- family owned and operated and makes us feel good to purchase from a small business. They were so nice. We had so much food  for our event. Pick-up was ready when we arrived and they accommodated us when we asked for some extra rice. Everyone had nothing but good things to say about the food. We had very little leftover. We will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Had the short ribs with macaroni,  steamed cabbage, and rice. A+ on the flavor. Really really good. Portions were generous. Staff was super nice and the place was clean. Can't wait to try more from the menu."}
{"text":"Just finished my lunch. This was my first time in and all of the staff were friendly and helpful. As I waited, multiple people made rounds checking on the customers. Food was great! Lived in Hawaii 3 years. Authentic plate lunch. I had chicken & shrimp combo today. Can't wait to try the BBQ Beef."}
{"text":"I always passed by Golden Hawaiian BBQ and never gave it any thought. So in honor of the video game release of Pokémon Sun and Moon I thought it would be fun to eat some Hawaiian food. As you walk in, it's a little cozy! And not to many people were around. I also noticed how clean the environment was and how easy to read the menu is. The women was very nice behind the counter and let us decide what to order as she helped prepare food. When we were ready she was so nice and polite.  I ended up ordering the Manapua, which is BBQ pork stuffed in some sort of rice bread dumpling. It was so sweet it almost tasted like candy. Of coarse you can't eat Hawaiian food without having Spam, so I also had the Spam Musubi, and it was like a sushi roll with Spam and it was so delicious I'm already craving it again! The BBQ chicken and Beef are cooked to melt in your mouth and it tastes so sweet! This place as a whole is the best Hawaiian BBQ I've had in the valley and can see myself coming back for the Spam Musubi many more times!"}
{"text":"Chicken Katsu is delicious and comes with fair to good mac salad, rice and awesome steamed cabbage. It's the food that earns four stars. The staff seems new and not always sure what's going on. Hopefully the food quality is retained and the employees get a bit more comfortable."}
{"text":"Just ordered through Postmates and I felt compelled to come rave about the food! I got the lemon pepper chicken, crab puffs and my mom got the orange chicken. Every bit of food was absolutely delicious! Even the macaroni salad was incredible. We will definitely be repeat customers. Can't wait to check it out in person!"}
{"text":"I loved this restaurant.  Great food and very nice service.  My family and I have been ordering almost every weekend since they opened.  I really recommend."}
{"text":"I've never written a bad review before but the lady that took my order was so rude! When I first came in there for the first time and tried to enter my Five Stars which carries coupons she said it wasn't working but I wanted to try it anyway. Then she said that I didn't have anything on there but my phone said I did. So I asked her if I could put it in again. So my coupons came up and she only let me use one when the other one said free dessert with no need of purchase for my birthday. Then when I brought it to her attention, she lied and said she can't do two coupons. Yet when I said it's a free desert she lied and said there's no desserts today."}
{"text":"Good food at a good price, quiet atmosphere and good service. Definitely enjoyed myself"}
{"text":"My family and I love this place! Looks new inside or renovated! There are a variety of food items and the prices are great! The food is delicious and is a lot more tasteful than other Hawaiian BBQ place we have tried out...can't beat L & L tho."}
{"text":"A fantastic place for all types of BBQs, chicken, pork, beef. The BBQ beef is FANTASTIC! It's like Korean BBQ, but for a fraction of cost. I love this place! They give you a large portion for a fraction of price and the quality remains high. If you have a large party, then it's a place to go. Their catering service is awesome. I have dined in & catered out . The owners are nice and friendly. The place is clean.  If you crave for certain Chinese dishes, you can ask the owner to make some for you. Don't forget to try their tender BBQ ribs. Yum!!"}
{"text":"Pretty damn solid. I was born and raised in Hawaii so my taste buds are keen to Hawaiian BBQ. Spam musubi was on point and the Kalua pork and chx Katsu were solid. Also the mac salad was pretty authentic."}
{"text":"I finally found a true taste of Hawaii! I've missed the food so much. I wish they had more Hawaiian dishes and less of the various Asian dishes but the loco moco, kalua pork, steamed rice and macaroni salad were just like I had on Oahu. Now if they'd just offer some Hawaiian purple sweet potatoes I'd know I'd died and gone to heaven. I can't wait to go back and my mom wants a large container of the macaroni salad she liked it so much. I have to say tho that as good as the loco moco was the kalua pork is unbelievable. Slightly sweet, wonderfully smokey, so tender it melts in your mouth. These guys are doing great for a place that can't bury the pig in the ground. You simply must try it."}
{"text":"Try the Teriyaki Chicken Bowl! It's to die for!! This place is a \"mom n pops\" and they treat you right. They know my order, all I have to do is walk in and they start my food. Love that kind of service!"}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed with this place. We came here for lunch with our two little ones during my husbands lunch break. 35 minutes passed and still no food. 3 People that ordered after us even received their meals before us. When you have hungry kids it's definitely not pleasant to wait so long.  I went to the counter to ask where our meal was and the girl looked confused as things still had not been made. She turned to the cook (I'm guessing he's the guy that owns/runs the place) and proceeded to try ask him. He snapped at her and was like \"WHAT! WHAT DO YOU NEED\"! I was shocked that someone could talk to other employees like that. After all the wait, I asked to take it to go. There was no compassion that they were so long with it and forgot some of the order. We went back to my husbands office to eat and realized things were STILL missing for my daughters meal. This was not a good experience and I will not be returning. I wish I could give it less than one star."}
{"text":"This place is pretty new and my brother keeps ordering from them so we decided to go here and finally try it out...the place is pretty small but its very clean.  We just ordered to go.  We got the bbq mix (katsu, chicken bbq, beef bbq with rice and macaroni) we also got spam musubi  There were 2 ladies working there..I saw one of them pull out the chicken from the fridge...so It was freshly made lol...  We had to wait a little bit but that's okay since she just cooked it.  Their spam musubi was sooooo good!!! best one I've had in a while so go get some!  The food was also very good..the meat was soft and flavorful.  It was pretty pricey..but it's worth it :)  Would go back again...even just for the musubi!"}
{"text":"I was expecting a slightly bigger serving when my bbq beef bowl arrived at the table for lunch.  For $5.95, I found the amount of white rice, cooked cabbage and grilled beef didn't satisfy me.  I'm thankful for the Yelp 10% off for it made lunch a but more digestible knowing I paid a bit less for this small meal.  Cabbage was shiny with oil, as with most Hawaiian fast food cabbage I've had here but the beef was good-hence brought my rating up to 3 stars instead if 2."}
{"text":"Still on the fence about this place as it's been hit or miss. It's been my go to for Hawaiian food because it's the closest Hawaiian plate lunch place since it opened but both quality and quantity have been inconsistent. At times the portions have been skimpy and at other times they were normal. Once I got the BBQ plate and the meats were way oversalted. Maybe I just need to get weekly updates on what hours the most experienced cook works before going there. When they're on they are just as good as any Hawaiian place on par with L&L. Wait times also vary. Not much ambience but I usually get it to go anyway. In the same mall on the northeast corner of Dobson and Chandler with Hungry Monk, Denny's, Basha's, and Los Favoritos. Plenty of parking. Open later than most Hawaiian type places."}
{"text":"Something about the masubi is so flavor forward with a reminiscent crave curb appeal. Masubi is a traditional simple Hawaiian food which is comprised of a nice sized slab of spam, with a soy sauce-sugar based sauce and rice wrapped in a nori seaweed sheet. This places gives you 2 finger sandwich half sizes of masubi for less than $4. They also offer chicken masubi and beef masubi which I have yet to try.   The favorite among the meats is the bbq chicken, the bbq chicken combo (bbq chicken and Katsu chicken) ~$8 and the bbq special combo ( bbq beef, bbq chicken and Kalbi short ribs) ~$11. The meals come with a mound of rice, their version of cold mayo based Macaroni salad and the meats over a light layering cabbage bed.   Environment was very basic with fast food tables and booths. Service was normal. To-go order included only one set of utensil and napkin (not napkins) for 3 order items. That was a bit odd.   Hawaiian bbq is available on GrubHub for pickup or delivery which was very convenient. The app itself and the customer service for this app needed some work."}
{"text":"Food was decent. Ordered the chicken and beef combination $10 plate.. definitely not worth the money, too little food for too much money.. will not be going here again"}
{"text":"It's okay. Food is not crave worthy but is fresh. If you do go the barbecue chicken is decent. I would say pass on the macaroni salad."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I've never been disappointed. One person said their chicken was dry but they also ate their meal 2 hours later so. Tastes great. Fair prices. I will be back definitely. Never had a problem with customer service. They have a range of Hawaiian canned drinks that taste great. They have one tv that always has sports on:)"}
{"text":"So happy this one opened since this is much closer for us than their original location.  This will be our go to spot from now on.  Everything we've ever had is great and the staff is very helpful and friendly.  Highly recommend this to everyone."}
{"text":"Awesome food! I tried everything. The problem is trying to figure out what to order next time I go! I might have to order one of everything again! Staff was friendly too!"}
{"text":"I'm new to town and I have seen this place many times and I decided to give it a try  I walked in and started looking at the menu  I asked the gal upfront for a few minutes because I'm new to place  I asked for recommendations and she had little to say .. short answers  I asked another question and again little to say  I popped back with .. please help me out here .. I have never been here before  Overall the food was pretty good accept for the flooded bag of sauce I brought home  Something wasn't closed properly I would imagine  If you don't know what you want I wouldn't recommend  I won't be returning"}
{"text":"Finally a worthy alternative to Leo's Hawaiian. Only had the teriyaki beef and chicken plate but everything was done right so will be back to try others. Beef was very tender and chicken was cooked properly sitting on a bed of steamed cabbage. The all important macaroni salad was there and tasty."}
{"text":"We found this place when we moved into the neighborhood, their Katsu is really good. Great portion for the price, not a huge fan of their macaroni salad."}
{"text":"This place isn't fast food...In fact it isn't good food.  Be prepared to wait 30 mins.  I think they have only one wok.  I had curry chicken served on fried cabbage.  Also a large scoop of sticky rice and macaroni salad.  The cabbage was tasty.  As I dipped into the rice I found a long black hair.  My stomach turned.  We only tried this place because our faces were packed and this place had 3 people.  Now I understand why.  WEAR A HAIRNET!"}
{"text":"Nice family owned restaurant with a large menu of Hawaiian influenced meals. Inside is very clean and tidy. They have some of the items up with pictures to help you make your selection. Fish, Chicken, Beef, Shrimp, Salads, Soups, Burgers and more.  Ordered the BBQ Chicken and Seafood Mix Combo. It came with BBQ chicken that was very tender along with some fried White Fish and Shrimp. This dish was served on a bed of steamed Cabbage with a side of both white Rice and Macaroni Salad.   I thought the food tasted pretty good but it did not knock my socks off. Experienced what felt like a MSG headache afterwards as well. Hmmm?  Great value and large portions with party trays and family meals also available. They even have a dish called the Loco Moco with Spam Spam Spam Spam, some Fried Eggs smothered in brown Gravy.  3.5 SPAMS - I mean STARS"}
{"text":"Good solid place Generous portions on the meat skimpy on the rice  solid place not the greatest but will satisfy your fix."}
{"text":"It was pretty good food...from Hawaii myself my standard of local food or plate lunches are pretty high. I would say it's a place to try out."}
{"text":"Food is good. The beef bbq plater with the shorts ribs had the best flavor. Also teriyaki chicken was also very good. The is food is fresh. Cooked to order. It is clean and offers a nice environment with music at the right level! Friendly Staff  Caution* The soda machine was not cleaned, but the issue was brought to their attention. So I'm hopeful they clean the machines properly. I did drop a star only because of this issue."}
{"text":"This new place  right behind our neighborhood. It's nice and new and much bigger than it looks from the outside. I went to use my Groupon and ordered additional dishes, chicken Kathy was so amazing, same with orange and teriyaki chicken.  Their macaroni is THE BEST I've ever had from a Hawaiian place here in Az. A bit slow but worth the wait. Fresh food and nice staff."}
{"text":"My brother told me about this place so we tried it out and I must say that it is super duper good!! It's like I'm back in hawaii every time I eat there!! Now I tell everyone about it and I hope they go because along with the 5 stars I give them 2 thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"Found this place from a delivery service and was no disappointed.  Loved the different musabi as well as the moca Loca plate.  They definitely give you your moneys worth"}
{"text":"There are few places in AZ that sell authentic Hawaiian food and being from Hawaii I would know. Place does it right, glad they opened one up in Chandler. Hope they come to Gilbert soon though."}
{"text":"This place is great! In my experience going here I have only great things to say. The owners are very nice and accommodating. The food is always ready and hot when I get there to pick it up and delicious every time! I could go to Ono but I feel they are a bit inconsistent. I know what I'm getting at Golden Hawaiian."}
{"text":"New to the area and was looking for a place to grab some food. Glad I came here! Food is spectacular and their customer service is beyond friendly and professional. Destiny made sure that food was good and helped me choose between the pineapple chicken and bbq chicken. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Food was below average, Mac salad was a complete disappointment,,,cashier was incredible rude,,went as far as to accuse me of trying to pass a counterfeit $100 Bill off on her ,,she didn't want t to make change ,,I wouldn't recommend it ."}
{"text":"We tried the beef and chicken combo. I loved the flavors. Tasted like a cross between Asian and Hawaiian foods but still very good. The portions were perfect for the reasonable price. Staff was very friendly. Restaurant was clean. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The bathrooms are clean and service good that was the best part about the place.  The pineapple chicken was really crispy meat but the sauce was a sweat and spicy sauce that tasted a little bit like pineapple.  The pork was OK.  Pot stickers and crab puffs felt like they were from Sysco supplies along with the macaroni salad.  I don't plan to ever go back and I would not recommend it.  It gets two starts for bathroom and service the rest is a miss."}
{"text":"4.5/5  This joint is all about the meat.  It sure as heck isn't about the sides of white rice and macaroni salad.  Those must be traditional sides because I see other Hawaiian-themed joints have those, but they do nothing for me.  I wish they had some greens or something a little healthier.  But anyway, back to the meat.  On my first visit I ordered the BBQ mix to try a variety of meats, some crab puffs, and potstickers ($5.98).  My husband was working in Chicago, so left to my own devices I scarfed that down by myself and took a huge nap.  That was a great afternoon.    For my second visit, he was here so I had to share (boo), and yesterday we picked up another BBQ mix combo ($10.98), the katsu chicken and kahlua pork combo ($8.58), and some crab puffs.  I am a total junkie for crab puffs and theirs ($4.38) aren't the best I've had (Dragon Wok and Tott's) but they are pretty good.    The meats are all so flavorful and tender.  I don't really have a favorite because they are all so good.  I loved the lightly breaded katsu chicken which comes with a nice dipping sauce.  The BBQ mix combo is a good choice if you want to sample their beef, chicken, and ribs.  They all are so tender and each has its own distinctive flavor.    The restaurant is very simply decorated and clean with friendly employees.  I'm already thinking about going back and getting some more of that chicken and trying something else.  This was my first time trying any kind of Hawaiian food and I'm so glad it's delicious and close to home."}
{"text":"So I was driving around Mesa and was looking for something different but affordable. This little place serves up a variety of Hawaiian cuisine at a great price. A standard plate consists of the main entree with white rice and macaroni salad. You can choose from chicken, meat or seafood or combine a couple entree items. They also have a various soups, salads or bowls to choose from. I love chicken Katsu and got that along with their BBQ chicken. You just can't beat the price for how generous the portion sizes are here. The staff is friendly and the food comes out quick. Great find!"}
{"text":"It's a small but clean place.  The menu is pretty large with lots of different options.  I ordered the loco moco and overall really enjoyed it.  The food took awhile to complete (there was no lunch rush) but it was worth it.  I'm definitely going back and try something else."}
{"text":"This place is quick and delicious. The spam musubi is a must to try. The mixed BBQ plate is like tasting a piece of Heaven. My wife loves the Kalbi short ribs plate. She said it was the best Hawaiian BBQ we've had in a long time."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum. I was craving legitimate Hawaiian food. This place did not disappoint. Their Kalua pork was delicious. My kids ate the macaroni salad super fast. I enjoyed their mauna poa but I felt like something was missing, it needed more moisture. I was a bit disappointed at the katsu chicken. It was super overcooked and they gave only one tiny sauce for a family meal. Overall, I liked them a lot with a few minor tweaks"}
{"text":"Food is great, staff is new and you can definitely tell due to the fact that as a first time customer coming and asking questions.. No one was real informative and the answers to most my questions were \"I don't know.\" Going back a few more times, food is STILL great, but he stores presentation gets dirtier and dirtier. Tables aren't wiped down, floors aren't swept, etc. like is said, food is always great but now I would rather just take it to go is all."}
{"text":"I want to say the food is good, but this is the 3rd strike. The mess my order up every time and then tell me I'm lying. I got chicken and pork and for an unknown reason I got dry gross fish. My musibi is drentched and soggy and the rice tastes way over cooked. I wish I could give a negative star."}
{"text":"We went there with multiple people in our group. Some of us had coupons. The owner was very rude and told us that we were \"Cheating\". How is it when it says one coupon per customer. It does not say per group. Of course after we open up the take out boxes, the owner got their revenge with super small portions. Overall the location was not clean. The tables still had food on them. Certainly hope that they will get what they deserve with that kind of service. Even if the food was good (it was not) I would not go back. Congratulations, you have earned 1 star. If I could, I would give a zero."}
{"text":"Tried this place yesterday.  I was pleased --- food was pretty tasty and of decent quality.  Prices are not cheap; but then again, not atrociously high either.  I bought a variety of entrees --- kalbi, teri-beef, chicken katsu, and BBQ chicken.  All pretty good.  The macaroni salad is OK, but could be better.  The only complaint I have is that they don't have a green salad option as opposed to mac salad.  I also ordered an order of crab puffs for my GF since she likes that stuff -- she said it was pretty good.  So I will be back.  There are not many Hawaiian plate lunch places available for our enjoyment."}
{"text":"We love this place!! Food is delicious.. we eat here at least once a wk  staff is amazing!! Destiny is the sweetest!"}
{"text":"Being that I grew up in Hawaii, I am pretty partial to Hawaiian food but am usually disappointed when getting Hawaiian food outside of Hawaii. However, I'm very excited to have found a great Hawaiian restaurant here in the greater phoenix area! I got the BBQ beef plate. The meat was tender and full of teriyaki flavor, and came with a very good sized portion which is reflective of a traditional Hawaiian plate lunch. You could tell they use great quality meet since it was tender, juicy and fresh. If you're looking for a taste of Hawaii, definitely worth the time to visit Golden Hawaiian BBQ!"}
{"text":"Looking for a decent Hawaiian food place & found it here. Tried the BBQ mix-a great way to try the chicken, beef & Kalbi short ribs. All very favorable-could use another scoop of rice & Mac salad was missing salt. Sampled the Spam Musubi & Manapua too. All very yummy too!! Lunch time during the week gets really busy, but worth the wait. The gentleman taking my order was very nice. Will definitely come back for sure to try the other items on the menu!!"}
{"text":"The food was great, and the prices were not bad :) Our food was ready for pick up in 10 minutes. The cashew chicken was perfect and delicious!"}
{"text":"Food is great. I got the fish and BBQ chicken combo. Fish was perfectly fried and the chicken was tender. I think they put too much cabbage which makes the portions look a little deceiving. Mac salad was pretty good I would come back"}
{"text":"This place is very small and kind of hard to see because it's in the corner. I recently tried and loved their chicken katsu. The sauce is delicious!! I think their prices are very reasonable and I always feel satisfied after. I'll be eating here more often!"}
{"text":"I had always heard great things and finally decided to try it. I was not disappointed! Chicken Katsu is amazing and perfectly golden and crispy! I can't wait to come back with friends!"}
{"text":"Pretty good Hawaiian Bbq. We hadn't had some in quite some time and we were hesitant to try a random place.. but we did and it was really good. Cute vibe.. people in and out the whole time.. it was nice. Looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Read the reviews and decided to check this place out. I was not disappoint. The BBQ is on point. I really enjoyed the pork. One of the better Hawaiian BBQ places on my list."}
{"text":"I recently tried this place out with the boyfriend since our regular Hawaiian BBQ place was closed and that's what he wanted. The food was legit. I feel like the entrees didn't have a lot of flavor, it was all in the sauce served on the side. We probably won't return. It's a casual setting with a lot of take out traffic coming in, so it was obvious we were just looking for something else. Most people didn't even need to look at the menu and knew what the wanted, did there were obviously regulars - another sign that its good food. Make good choices!"}
{"text":"Not terrible, but not terrific.  I ordered the teriyaki chicken bowl on spam musubi over GrubHub and wasn't too impressed. Not sure exactly how long it took for the food to get from the kitchen to my plate, but things were a little soggy. The spam tasted a little mushy like it had been boiled not pan-fried. The cabbage leaves in the teriyaki bowl weren't chopped (which I'm used to), so it was hard to eat/cut with a fork. The chicken was okay but seemed like a rendition of home made teriyaki chicken I could make myself...I prefer more authentic tasting Hawaiian chicken that would be too hard for me to recreate."}
{"text":"Complete idiots here I ordered the pineapple chicken, this was my first time here and I sat down to eat and didn't taste like pineapple chicken so I ate it cause I only have certain time frame for lunch, I go to look at the picture and they gave me chicken katsu instead. I say something to the employee completely ignored me. I will never go back!"}
{"text":"Hawaiian BBQ craving satisfied! Came to Chandler to visit family and they brought me to this place. Fantastic! Got the BBQ Mix and the Short Ribs were great. Thick and not that fatty. Clean place. If I lived here, I would probably become a regular."}
{"text":"Worst Hawaiian food i have ever had....ate it hours ago and my stomach is aching .the macaroni was flavorless,bbq beef was so fatty ,kalbi ribs nohing but fat,even the chicken was low quality meat.growing up in southern California I expected more....best Hawaiian food i have had in Arizona is aloha kitchen in mesa only 5-7 mins from this nasty place and way better quality,taste,and portions. Dont waste your money here!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came out here as we were exploring a nearby (I think?) Asian market, and were looking for a bite to eat. I was surprised to find out my wife had never had Hawaiian BBQ, so I forced her to come. We have a ton of L&Ls and used to have a Da Kine's back home, so I'm thinking it was gonna be the same.  And it was, but the portions were bigger. I did a loco moco plate lunch, which is two hamburger patties with two fried eggs on top, and then covered in gravy. It was excellent. Here they served it on a bed of cabbage, and that cabbage was pretty good, too. Macaroni salad was good. Rice was rice.The wife had a kalua pork, and it was really good (I ate some) and a really large portion. Very tasty. I also got a thai iced tea which they made themselves and it was really excellent. Like, one of the better ones I've ever had.  I was really impressed with this place, and I'm glad to have found another restaurant that reminds of home. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp when looking for an alternative to my normal lunch spots.  I am a fan of Hawaiian BBQ even if I forget it from time to time and go awhile without eating it.  I got the mixed combo from here with chicken, beef and short ribs. They were all pretty solid for BBQ my only issues were that I like a little more sauce on mine than it had and I was a bit underwhelmed on the quantity as it looked like more but was just a bunch of cabbage underneath. The flavors were really good I think the chicken was my favorite but the beef was close, a bit more sauce could swing this as the beef needed a bit more moisture. Everything is clearly cooked fresh which is a nice bonus.   The macaroni salad which is key for Hawaiian BBQ was on point and very tasty, just wish there was a bit more.  The price was pretty fair but like I said would expect a bit more meat. I'll be back soon and try some of the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"me and my friend got a ton of takeout from this place for a baby shower!    probably the best Luau Pig ive ever had bar none! perfectly seasoned and fork tender, with juices  to compliment the dish.   also had the fried shrimps, nicely shaped in a ring! chicken teriyaki was another top notch dish...not dry and sauce was had the right twang!   also ordered chicken katsu..,a bit dry and breading too much. the sauce was so so...not the proper katsu sauce.    another awesome dish was the beef short rib Kalbi! smoky goodness, tender and juicy, a delight in every bite!   for my wife, she told me the macaroni salad was a winner too, very al dente...the sauce/ dressing was amazing!   very happy and satisfied customer!   happy eating!"}
{"text":"Agreeing with the others, excellent food, friendly staff. We had a good meal here. Highly recommending GHBbq!"}
{"text":"Excellent! I had the orange chicken with rice, cooked cabbage and macaroni salad and my friend had a pork dish that was very good. Prices are reasonable (less than $8 for the lunch plate).  The staff is friendly and helpful and the dining area and bathrooms are very clean. This restaurant is near where my friend lives and I was pleased to find out that there is a 2nd branch of this business near where I live (across the street fro MCC). I will be returning to one of these Hawaiian eateries. :-)"}
{"text":"Ah-mazing!!!! The service was great! Fast and friendly!  The food OMG!!!! the portion size was excellent and spot on with the price!  My new favorite place for lunch!"}
{"text":"So we have visited twice now.  The first time I really wanted a Loco Moco.  It really was nothing special.  Not bad, but not great.  Seems to me the one I had in Hawaii several years ago had more robust flavor, even though it really is pretty basic.  The second visit I had the BBQ platter and my wife had the laulau plate.  These were both similar to the sorts of plates you can get in a \"plate lunch\" shop on the Islands.  The laulau had really nice flavor (I had a bite), but they needed to trim the fat a bit.  I expect some fat in a dish like this, but this was too much.  The BBQ plate features chicken, pork short ribs (kalbi), and beef.  Of the three the beef was more flavorful.  Definitely.  I really liked that.  Both the short ribs and the chicken were less interesting.  Not bad, but less interesting.  Service was friendly, and they didn't mind giving you cups of teriyaki sauce.  I think if the fat in the laulau had been removed I'd probably have to go to four stars.  Except for the fat my wife really liked it, and I also thought it was pretty good.  My BBQ beef had really good flavor also, and the chicken and pork were fine.  I do think they deserve more than three stars.  Removing that large chunk of fat would have done it for them.  As it is I just can't bring myself to click on that fourth star.  Another situation where Yelp should allow half-stars in the ratings.  Two locations, but not a national chain."}
{"text":"Decided to try Golden Hawaiian delivery through Amazon after seeing the manapua and remembering how much I love manapua.  After checking the reviews, I tried the mini BBQ beef meal and was honestly surprised after reading how many people complained about the size.   The mini meal was about as big as any lunch combo I get at any other restaurant and for approximately the same price.  It definitely did the job of filling me up, except that the beef was a bit stringy and fatty for my taste.  I also included an egg roll which I didn't so much enjoy because it was far too hard to eat.  The pieces of lettuce and carrots were very stringy and long and I would end up with half the insides hanging down from my face after taking a bite.  That is always annoying.  I was also unimpressed with the flavor of the manapua.  It was dry and the dough was a bit too bland. I am interested in trying the katsu, so I will most likely be trying them again in the near future, but I can say I will not be eating the manapua or the egg roll next time."}
{"text":"Best spam musubi since we left Vegas years ago, the curry is pretty good, the orange chicken is so good and the restaurant is clean. Portions are huge! Food came out fairly quickly and we are satisfied of our Hawaiian craving. The Mac salad was simple and traditional."}
{"text":"Service is very nice and the Yelp check-in is a good bonus (10% off), Golden Hawaiian BBQ is not a chain which makes giving a lower rating more difficult but... While the restaurant seemed extremely clean, the steamed cabbage I received was not. A couple of pieces from the cabbage looked like they had dirt on them and probably should have been cleaned better. Unfortunately, the chicken meat seemed cheap and I ended up not eating parts due to the unpleasant texture. Also, the katsu sauce was not what I was expecting (not bad - just different). And it is important to note that after eating my meal I did end up getting a bad headache. Could just be a coincidence but if you are sensitive I'd keep that in mind before ordering here."}
{"text":"Definitely not what we expected....My family and I heard about this place through a friend of ours that lives in Chandler. So, my family and I decided to check it out since we have visited Hawaii before and really enjoyed the Hawaiian Cuisine. So, lets start with the review...  As soon as we arrived to this place my family and I walked in and we all wanted to immediately walk out because for a minute it smelt like something died in the restaurant..But we stayed anyways. The decor of the place was not very inviting, nothing really representing Hawaii but a large wallpaper like picture of Coconut tree's which me and my husband and I saw that it had bubbling and was not put up properly. Yes, Hawaii does have coconut trees but so do a lot of other places. As we went to look for a place to sit the tables looked really nasty and looked like it had not been cleaned for hours. We sat the kids down while my husband and I went to look at the menu.  Menu was to our opinion very minimal and the prices were outrageously high for what the were offering. So, when we went to the counter we were greeted by the cashier (not very pleasant at all). We ordered our food: Husband ordered the Loco Moco, I ordered the Barbecue Chicken, My oldest daughter ordered the Kalua Pork (in Hawaii they call it Kalua Pig), my youngest daughter ordered the Chicken Katsu, and we ordered our son his Spam Musubi. So, it took about 20 minutes to get our food and so when we took it to the nasty tables we opened our plates and not what we expected at all.. The portions are very skimpy, we all looked at each other and was like \"Whaaaaaat the heck is this\" so we all sampled each others food.  Lets start with the Loco Moco, it was not a Loco Moco like how its serve in Hawaii it was a deconstructed Loco Moco. In Hawaii the Loco Moco is a huge dish that all the surfers and construction workers love to eat..because it keeps them energized...everything is on top of everything. This Loco Moco was deconstrcuted..: two tasteless patties with over cooked eggs, and gravy on top, rice on the side and their version of mac salad.(truely not a Loco Moco), On to the Chicken Katsu: Chicken was to thin and very dry, no flavor in the panko breading, Katsu Sauce was to salty and who in the right mind would put fried things on a bed of nasty boiled cabbage, that makes the food soggy..(actually all the plates had boiled cabbage..Blehhh). On to the Kalua Pork: Ummm..definitely not the way Hawaii makes it...it was not fresh at all and it seemed like it was microwaved because some of it was still cold. There was no flavor at all to this dish. On to the Barbecue Chicken...omg!! yuk yuk and yuk...dry as hell, no char broiled grill marks like how its served in Hawaii looked like it was cooked on a flat top grill and there was no flavor. On to my sons Spam Musubi...he took on bite of it and did not want to eat it any more...My son knows his Spam Musubi and he said it was junk..we tried it and man it was nasty. Spam was under cooked and not marinated in sauce the sauce they used tasted like teriyaki salty sauce...blehhh.. Oh, forgot to mention about the mac salad, my husband and i tasted an unusual taste and we both agreed it tasted like chicken bouillon and MSG!!! Folks MSG can be very bad for ya..  This experience was really really definitely the worst of the worst Hawaiian eateries we tried and would not recommend this place at all to anyone who are wanting the taste of the Hawaiian Islands...We know that there are Hawaiian people that live here in Arizona and god forbid if a true Hawaiian went in to this place...Overall, food was terrible, customer service way below average. No, feeling of the ALOHA SPIRIT that we experienced when visiting Hawaii..We were all greeted with a big \"ALOOOOOHA\"..in Hawaii...Basically this place  misrepresents the Hawaiian Culture, its a mixture of asian fusion, american, chinese, nothing really representing the true hawaiian cuisine..  A huge suggestion for the owner of this establishment, maybe you should reconsider your menu selections and pricing, do research on the true meaning of representing the Hawaiian Culture and its food. Again, I will not represent this establishment to anyone. I wish there was a minus star rating system...because I'd give this place minus 4 stars..."}
{"text":"On a scale of 1 to Even, I can't... I truly don't know where to start.   After moving into the area 6 months ago, I've been hitting this plaza regularly for Chiba Hut, but never stepped in to GHB. Some folks I were meeting congregated three doors down instead and I have found my kryptonite.  Not lying, I got the teriyaki chicken mini-meal and it was like I was tasting for the first time. This fresh made, locally sourced meal was a revelation. The house-made mac salad has ruined every other mac salad for me. They will all just be pretenders to the throne.   I love food, but I'm no glutton. However, I did, after a brief internal debate, order a second meal.... the BBQ beef mini-meal was accompanied by a chorus of angels with a beat track laid down by demons. Nothing tastes that good without some kind of supernatural price. I considered finding a priest to hear the confession of what must surely be sins I was committing with my mouth.   They will be yelling \"NORM\" when i walk in before long."}
{"text":"I was recommended o this cute little place by a friend who was born in Hawaii.  I'm a big fan of Loco Moco and plate lunches having hspent a ton of time in Hawaii. This place is clean and casual in a fast food kind of way, except they made my dish from scratch.  It was excellent Loco Moco and the real deal. Definitely check this place out for a taste of home or just a great taste of Hawaii"}
{"text":"the loco moco was delicious , and well seasoned. We also had the Kalua pork and the chicken katsu mix plate  and it was also really juicy and full of flavor , the chicken was crispy but not dry, the mac salad was one of the best I've tasted in a while. Thank you Golden Hawaiian BBQ for a great meal !"}
{"text":"Tonight we went to the Golden Hawaiian BBQ in Chandler at Dobson and Chandler Blvd.  I had the Kalbi short ribs plate. I couldn't cut the meat with the plastic knife so I used my fingers to try to rip it.. But there was so much gristle and fat that I spit out more than I took in. Plus if it wasn't for putting teriyaki sauce on it there would not have been any flavor to the meat.  I'm not a rice person but the rice with some teriyaki sauce and the macaroni salad and cooked cabbage were better than the meat.   My husband had the BBQ chicken but it was kind of dry or overcooked.    I don't think we will be going back."}
{"text":"25 cent charge for under five dollars? Ok 1.95$ small portion frys? Ok Taking 10 minutes to cook said frys? Not ok I watched the lady cook another order full bbq plate in 8 minutes but my frys took 10 mintutes? Thanks but no thanks."}
{"text":"I've always had a good experience here. Good, fresh food. It reminds me of the great Hawaiian BBQ places that you'll find in LA. They're fast and friendly. You're sure to enjoy."}
{"text":"The taste of the food is very consistent, I just wish they'd put a little more in my plate! Clean, nice and good food, just not enough in your plate. I get more cabbage than meat most of the time, so you should definitely ask for a mini or just extra meat."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night. Not too busy but there were some customers inside as well. Parking lot is great as they have one. Inside is pretty clean and simple.  I ordered the hot and spicy chicken, not knowing what to expect. Upon eating it, it tastes like the hot and spicy marinated sauce was more of the Korean gochujang sauce. Tastes pretty close, might even be it. It was good with regards to the fact that I would eat it, but some of the grilled chicken had burnt ends, which I would prefer to not have that. Comes with a side of rice and steame cabbage I believe. Also a side of mac and cheese. Nothing to special about either siDes.  Pricing was around $9 plus tax. So not that cheap.  I also tried the spam Musubi. Just okay, nothing special. Pricing was around$4 something.  Will need to check out more Hawaiian places around here."}
{"text":"Friendly service and food was made fresh when we came in to order. The only downside is portions are small and the macaroni salad was horrible! I wanted to give this place a try because it isn't a chain hawaiian BBQ place and I'm a big supporter of mom & pop shops, but Golden Hawaiian wasn't as good as L&L or Aloha Hawaiian BBQ. We got the bbq chicken & chicken katsu combo as well as spam musubi. The musubi had way too much rice so it was thick and tall, the seaweed was falling apart and couldn't hold the musubi together. I was so disappointed with the mac salad that I stopped eating it after the first bite. The bbq chicken was good, but I wished they gave us extra sauce on the side. They only gave us the katsu sauce. Their chicken katsu was good! Very nice crunchy exterior and not too oily. I've been to a lot of hawaiian bbq places back home in socal so maybe I had too high of expectations after a long hike"}
{"text":"Great food. Chicken is actually breaded & fried so it stays crunchy not soggy. Everything is flavorful & delicious. Plus they have authentic Hawaiian beverages that I love & are hard to find. New favorite spot!"}
{"text":"So so good!!!! The food is delicious. I love the chicken katsu. Very fresh everytime! The spam musubi us to die for. Definitely worth it and very affordable!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy Hawaiian food when you're craving.  Only thing they're missing are the malasadas!  Great food and service!"}
{"text":"I was craving Hawaiian BBQ and thought I'd try this place. Service was great and the food came out quickly. That is a plus! The chicken was tender and flavorful. The shrimp was \"okay\" - nothing to write home about. The macaroni salad was average. Let's face it - part of the Hawaiian BBQ experience is the awesome macaroni salad and this didn't cut it. It was dry and tasteless. They didn't have napkins available nor did they have sauces available other than the prepackaged soy sauce. Meh. I'll stick with my regular place from now on."}
{"text":"This place is really nice. Walked in immediately got greeted ordered my food I had the spicy chicken my daughter had the Hawaiian bbq with Katsu it was amazing. All the tables were clean the staff was really nice made sure to ask if we were ok a few times. I will definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"Man I wish this place was good and close. Paid 12 dollars for this lol it's crazy to me. I did not get rice Mac but come on 12 dollars??? And this is what you give me. Smh last time coming in this store"}
{"text":"My daughter and I were headed for Jimmy Johns with the babbies for a bite to eat when I spotted the grand opening sign for this place and the word Hawaiian.  Screeeech!  We went here instead and were very glad.  Not only were the two ladies behind the counter as nice as could be, very helpful, very patient concerning a fussy baby and active toddler, but the food was fantastic!    When I saw the soups on the menu I asked them where were they two weeks ago when I was coming down with the cold from hell and wanted nothing but chicken soup to eat?    They evidently had just opened a few days earlier.  I got a BBQ Mix that included beef, chicken and short ribs, all tender and moist with wonderful flavor.  My daughter got a Chicken and Seafood Mix that included shrimp and white fish.  We traded bites and everything was delicious.  So were the Crab Puffs we got as an appetizer.  Nummy!   I posted pictures.  And to top it off everything on the menu was 25% off as a Grand Opening special.  So it was wonderful AND a bargain.  My only regret is the 25% off was only till Oct 31st and I meant to get back again by then but didn't.  I'll still try to return before I leave the area, though.  Parking is a piece of cake--there's a huge lot.  I highly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"I am so happy I found this place. Right across from Mesa community college. Authentic, delicious, relatively healthy... What more can one ask for? Really takes me back to my trip to the islands. There is seriously nothing wrong you could order on the menu."}
{"text":"This place is so good! The meat is amazing and the staff is so friendly! Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Ordered Loco Moco, not bad, not great. Easy enough, hamburger patty, egg, brown gravy. Served on a giant bed of.... boiled cabbage? Not sure what to do with all that. Anyway, mac salad was ok, nothing like home but it will do. Also, for any real locals who want to check this place out bring your own shoyu and tobasco/sriracha otherwise you'll be using taco sauce and 'kari-out' soy sauce, which I'm pretty sure is just black water."}
{"text":"It's good but not GR8! Their menu is a bit overpriced! Quality of the food wasn't the best! I should know, I'm only from Hawaii..i mean it's nice to have a hawaiian joint in Mesa but I wish it was L&L instead..."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I Love coming to this place to get Hawaiian food! So much better than Onos bbq! The BBQ chicken is to die for! it is so much food for such a great price! Only problem i have with them is they don't deliver and i am 90% of the time the food picker upper. So once they get delivery goin ill be more than happy!!  I cannot force myself to get anything besides the bbq chicken because it is just that good, the luau pork has so much in there i only ate a few bites and was stuffed.  And i have an appetite believe me.  My coworkers tend to get the crispy shrimp and the katsu chicken or teriyaki and love all of the food they ever try besides these as well.   This place does not use MSG to my knowledge otherwise my boyfriend would be throwing up every time we order since he is allergic to MSG.   My coworkers happen to love the crispy shrimp and the bbq short ribs as well along with the potsickers."}
{"text":"Easily one of the better Hawaiian BBQ restaurants in the whole valley. On most days the establishment is quiet with music playing the background with low volume. Perfect for those days when you're out and enjoying the day with your own thoughts. I recommend the spam masubi and BBQ mix. Can't go wrong with either of those."}
{"text":"I had the BBQ sampler and it was so great to try different flavors! Having been to Hawaii and loving the cuisine, I craved the short ribs - which I got to try in this sampler! The portion was fantastic - a full plateful - and the whole meal was $12! It came with a side of sticky rice and cold macaroni salad. I was very satisfied! I will come back for the taste, portion and price! The only part that didn't work for me was the presentation and plastic knife to cut the meat. The dining experience is \"diner-style\" with booths and chairs."}
{"text":"Great selection of meat, chicken and some fish. Everything tasted fresh and healthy. Really enjoyed the pork and the hot and spicy chicken. Staff was friendly and professional. Don't forget to check in and get your 10% off. Makes it an even better meal!"}
{"text":"Clean place in a nondescript strip mall. Decent, fresh food. OK service.  I've been looking for a good Hawaiian BBQ place here in the Valley since I moved here. I can't say that I really have found it yet, but this was decent. When I first came here, I walked in to a nearly empty restaurant and became a little nervous, considering that it was right at the time when there should be a lunch rush. But it turned out that we had beaten the crowd, and it filled up decently after we arrived.  When I ordered, the cashier wasn't particularly helpful. I asked if there were any substitutes for the macaroni salad, which I can't eat, and he said \"more rice\". I asked if there was anything else, but he said no. I paid and was about to sit down and noticed the pictures on the menu with vegetables on the very plate I had ordered. I asked him if there were vegetables, and he said yes, so I asked if I could have more of those instead of the macaroni salad. He said OK to that, so it worked out, but it seemed like a lot of effort to get there.  On to the food. They cooked everything fresh while we were waiting. The food all came out nice and piping hot. I ordered the chicken and pork combo plate, which came with rice, steamed cabbage, teriyaki chicken, and kalua pork (also, it normally comes with macaroni salad). Everything was good, but nothing was great. The chicken was nice, hot, and tender. It was a little under-seasoned, but with some sauce, it was good. And it was definitely cooked right. The pork was a little dry. Teriyaki sauce is available by request, but considering the lack of flavor and dryness, maybe it should come with the plate by default. Also, quantity: I am used to being stuffed when I go to Hawaiian BBQ places. I left here not only not stuffed, but a little hungry still. I acknowledge that I eat more than a lot of people, but it just didn't meet my expectations of this type of establishment.  Price: This is definitely a bargain. For a really low price, you get a decent amount of freshly-made, solid food. It's definitely a good stop for lunch. It won't blow your socks off--well, it won't blow my socks off--but it's a much better option than many out there for a good lunch.  I wouldn't mind coming back. But it's not at the top of my list."}
{"text":"Food was great, service was eh, I asked a question and the answer wasn't very descriptive but everything else was good and I would recommend this place. It's a nice little food shop!"}
{"text":"Went because it had 4 stars, tried sampler and manapua. Yuch. Low quality ingredients. Not good at all. Decided not to finish it because I worried about the quality. Hawaiian in name only."}
{"text":"I had the chicken bowl with extra veggies and no rice. Can't go wrong for the price but the portion was a bit small"}
{"text":"I love Hawaiian food. Large quantities, loads of sauce, and always happy people. I want to come back for more, but I will order the whole menu!"}
{"text":"I haven't physically visited this location, but have tried their kalbi and macaroni salad and enjoyed it. Their kileau pork is also the right flavor. I will update the review when I visit physically and share the experience."}
{"text":"This is a totally legit Hawaiian bar-b-cue joint.  The spicy chicken with rice and macaroni salad was absolutely delicious.  They have Spam Musubi and Loco Mocos!  I've spent alot of time in Hawaii and this place is the most authentic Hawaiian food I've seen in Arizona.  I'll definitely be returning soon."}
{"text":"This is our third time here and it is excellent every time. The chicken and beef combo is my go-to but my husband swears by the kalua pork. The meats are always tender, juicy and flavorful. The plates come with white rice, macaroni salad, which we both love and there is also steamed cabbage. The prices are decent for the amount of food you get. The service has always been friendly and fast. It's one of our favorite comfort food places to go to. So far we have not been too adventurous to try things like laulau or loco moco but I think one of the next times we're here, we will try something new."}
{"text":"I eat here at least once a month, always satisfied with the food.  I do wish the prices were a little lower though"}
{"text":"I was an employee here just recently. I quit after three days!! My first day there the owner, Stanley was soo horrible to me. I couldn't memorize the whole menu in only a few hours and he told me that I was wasting his time and that I'm not trying and that I need to learn a lot faster. He had people call me to test me and if I got something wrong or I made a mistake he would yell at me. I learned the whole menu that day and the next day I did a lot better and I worked my ass off even though I wasn't even trained properly. He expected me to know things I wasn't even taught. I asked him a question just to make sure so that I wouldn't make a mistake and he yelled at me because I should have known everything already. He told me that I was wasting his money and that he couldn't afford to train me. That day one of the employees that worked there for 3 years said it's taking a toll on her mental health but she stays because she makes good hrs because there's only 5 people working there. She told me that everyone quits after the first day of working there because of Stanley. Here's a tip Stanley... if you cant afford to train new employees, you shouldn't be running a restaurant. Mistakes will happen and maybe if you have a better approach you'll actually have some good business and some very well trained employees. Sorry but I hope you get shut down. By the way, no one eat here. Its disgusting. I dropped sauce cups on the floor by accident because they weren't tied correctly and he made me pick them up and put them back even though they fell on their nasty floor. I'd rather work at McDonald's."}
{"text":"To me, Hawaiian food is one of the best comfort foods out there. Give me teriyaki chicken and mac salad over fried chicken and macaroni and cheese any day. (well almost any day) So of course when I hear there is a new Hawaiian place in town I have to go check it out.  The boyfriend and I went to get our plate lunch on on a Thursday night. I would assume they since they across the street from MCC they do most of their business at lunch because at 7pm we were the only people in the place. If they don't get a lunch rush, this place may be doomed.  I ordered the BBQ beef mini plate and boyfriend got the chicken katsu mini. The food came out fast. If you've had Hawaiian food before you know the portions are generally quite large and this place is no different. The mini plate is plenty of food for one person - a decent sized portion of meat, a scoop of white rice and a scoop of mac salad.  The BBQ beef had a good flavor and was tender. Boyfriend enjoyed the katsu as well, good pieces of chicken. The mac salad was different. I think there may have been shrimp in it? It was pink and had a slight shrimp taste to it. Not a typical mac salad but not bad.  We both left satisfied but not blown away. However, a couple hours later I didn't feel quite right - like the kind of feeling I get if I eat MSG. Now I don't know for sure that there was MSG in the food but I felt weird and boyfriend couldn't sleep. Hopefully it was just a coincidence but if you're sensitive to MSH like I am, you might want to be on the lookout."}
{"text":"Awesome!  This place is inexpensive, quick and delicious.  No atmosphere.... it's like a truck stop and a school lunch room had a had a baby but the food is much more sophisticated.  If it's Hawaiian, they serve it here.  Get Manapua or a moco loco.  They have Hawaiian canned juices too.  The macaroni salad is traditional, the rice is sweet and plentiful, and the range of entrees covers everything from Laulau (pit smoked) to BBQ to Katsu."}
{"text":"This place is awful! Not only is it overpriced compared to other Hawaiian restaurants in Phoenix, they charge extra for teriyaki sauce & katsu sauce even when you order Chicken Katsu & BBQ Beef. The gentleman who tried to explain to me why I needed to pay extra for sauce with my meals (5 meals) was extremely rude and continued to tell me 'I just need to listen' excuse me...I will never return!!"}
{"text":"Menu : bbq mix  Food Rating : 4 stars Service Rating : 5 stars   Self service restaurant. Food was good and price was reasonable.    Comparison: Hawaiian Bbq(Tempe) vs. Golden Hawaiian bbq  I personally like this place than Hawaiian bbq in tempe. But Hawaiian bbq one has more bbq options and you can choose your sides."}
{"text":"Overall the food was ok. The crab puffs had a very tart flavor so I requested to exchange them for macaroni salad. At first we we're given a little bit of push back but after reaching out to their management they honored our request."}
{"text":"I usually order the kalbi short ribs with white rice and side of Mac Salad. I usually call and come to pick it up during my lunch break so I wouldn't have to wait, and they do a pretty good job at getting those orders ready. It's consistent but I've never tried anything else on the menu. They also do a lot of delivery services if you aren't able to pick it up - I saw tablets for Uber Eats and Postmates. If you're craving for something fast, definitely go here!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have frequented this restaurant since it opened.We used to go to Aloha Kitchen,but no more.Not only is the service much more pleasant,they also make their luau pork everyday.not just Wed and Sat.Can't go wrong with anything on the menu.Best chicken Katsu,bbq chicken,and fried fish are my wifes faves.I also luv the short ribs and luau pork.Please give these folks a try,you will come back."}
{"text":"I bought a groupon that was good for 3 visits. We live right around the corner from Aloha Kitchen on Alma School and Guadalupe so we will always be partial to there, but Golden Hawaiian was good.   Most of the entrees are average compared to other Hawaiian places in the valley, but the one thing that really solidified my 4th star for them is their loco moco. Their loco moco is one of the tastiest ones I've ever had (and I'm from Hawaii)! Their burger patty is big, well-seasoned and juicy and the egg/gravy is always well prepared.  I've had the orange chicken, katsu and musubi--all of it was so-so. The only thing I will get from here is the loco moco, but it is well worth the trip for me :)"}
{"text":"Hot made to order food. Always friendly service. Quick delicious lunch option when nearby for me!"}
{"text":"This place falls short of Ono Hawaiian BBQ, but still good portion for take out. Macaroni salad lacked flavor and dressing seemed thin. Teriyaki Chicken was flavorful and was well cooked. White rice was just that and the cabbage was not bad. It was clean and It has an A rating from the inspectors. I wish I could be more enthusiastic for this family owned business. I can say I will be back to give it another try."}
{"text":"We tried this for dinner our first night in town. It was ok, but we were glad we didn't order more food and spend more money. (We got two plates instead of the family dinner.) The short ribs and beef were way too tough and chewy. The shrimp was neither good nor bad. The chicken was the best thing we tried and I like that they cook the cabbage they use as garnish. I wouldn't come here again, though."}
{"text":"A surprising gem in the ho-hum stripe-mall-chain-store-suburbia sprawl that is \"heat stroke\" Chandler, AZ.   I was a bit scared; the menu advertised \"beef noodle soup\" and \"wonton noodle soup\", but no \"saimin\".  But, too lazy to find another place in the searing heat, I bravely went for the chicken and fried seafood combo, and took my mystery box back to the hotel.   Chicken?  Tender and delicious.  Macaroni  salad?  It's cool, not warm, even has bits of potato!  Seafood?  Well, so-so, but came with this awesome (and a bit addictive) sweet and sour sauce.    I don't know if this is authentic or not (ok, likely not), but this food was hitting my palate way above its $12 price should.   Chandler sucks (why would anyone want to live in this burning hell?!), but Golden Hawaiian BBQ rocks."}
{"text":"Large portions for a nice price.  It's nice to see the guys back there cooking the food freshly and not scooping out of a warmer.  I asked for extra cabbage vice the mac salad and they were happy to accommodate.  Close to work, quick friendly service, and a solid meal makes this place a regular lunch time spot for me."}
{"text":"We live near by and have been waiting for this place to open for the longest time. Finally got a chance to come in to try it out. I got tried the BBQ beef and my girlfriend got the BBQ Chicken and Shrimp. It was delicious!! We finally have a new quick Hawaiian place to eat at. The meats were not greasy or anything. The combos come with cabbage, steamed rice and everyone's favorite, Mac Salad.  After getting our meals, the gentleman at the register came around to ask how the food was and if we needed anything. He was very courteous and nice. Will definitely be coming back again!!"}
{"text":"Yummy!  Meats are all good and love the vegetables that come with the combos!  My  kids like the pineapple chicken and three of them split it for a kids meals.  I like the barbecue chicken  so lean and flavorful!  Meals are filling.  One thing. Ended at this place...some brewed unsweetened ice tea."}
{"text":"The Skinny: The food was plentiful and delicious, service was meh.... Details: We ended up ordering the family meal which was in essence quite a bit of food. So go hungry if you plan on going! The food tasted fresh and was plentiful and well worth the money. The food was fast-casual so it was ordering at the counter and the drinks were self serve which was a big plus for me and the kids.  Should you go: Definitely go. It was good The bad: The only \"bad\" thing was the person at the counter. You could tell she was just \"not feeling\" the work thing that day. She was very curt and sighed quite a bit when I had questions for her which did not seem to be the best attitude to have if you are in customer service. Again, she could have just had an off day so I will give her the benefit of the doubt."}
{"text":"Really great all the meats were tender and flavorful We had kalbi, BBQ beef, chicken and kids had teriyaki chicken that they really liked  Staff was very nice"}
{"text":"I read the reviews, and i have to agree with the one star reviews about the fatty Kalbi! I love the kalbi with a little fat, but this was what I would consider the cheapest cut of meat ever, pure fat and not tasty at all, also it seemed pre prepared! and had a boiled texture.  The rice did seem plentiful, against other reviews but who cares? when the food is no good why bother with the rice, my cats ate the garbage food, and my kid ate the rice. most got tossed out,  We went through Grub Hub cost 31 bucks, what a waste of money, We went to bed hungry!   The chicken in the mix... was dark meat, and actually tasted somewhat good but I hate dark meat. and the beef was dried up, and revolting!  the cabbage had no taste like it was boiled to long. I had always wanted to try Hawian BBQ, I love Mongolian BBQ and there is a Hawaiian BBQ next door after 7 years eating YC's We went for this. if not for my child being sick, I would have driven to YC's where we return often, I am off to brag about them on yelp this very minute."}
{"text":"I visited this place on a whim, browsing through Yelp to find a place for lunch near work and have been twice now.  Both visits have been excellent! I have tried the chicken katsu, and the spicy chicken.  Both were so delicious, served with rice and macaroni salad on a bed of cabbage. The flavors were addicting and the meal satisfying. Portions were good, and reasonably priced.  I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The food and service here is nothing short of amazing. Everything is fresh and the restaurant is very clean. The BBQ beef is my standard"}
{"text":"This place has delicious and fresh spam and bbq beef musubis! Definitely want to come back to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Being one of the few places open on New Year's Day, we ventured in wanting some slow-roasted pork.  The lady at the counter was very nice and friendly, and it took only a short time for the kalua pork to be made.  It smelled heavenly and tasted even better!  The pork was tender, juicy, and had a deep, smokey flavor to it.  We even got a coupon for our next visit.  The convenient location also makes it a great place for a casual lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Golden Hawaiian BBQ specializes in- you guessed it- BBQ. They offer marinated and deep fried meats in chicken, beef, pork, fish and shrimp. Vegetables don't really exist here except for the small slivers of carrot in the macaroni salad and the small chunk of cooked cabbage that comes with the lunch plates.   They offer single meat, combination meat plates, and mini meals. I went with the kalua pork and chicken combination. It came with a large scoop of white rice, macaroni salad, and a small wedge of cabbage. The chicken was thigh meat, marinated and grilled, and was tender with good flavor. I loved the earthy grilled taste of it. The kalua pork was decent. It was a large portion with smoky salty flavor. There was something about the texture that I didn't quite like 100% though, like it was slightly stringy/dry tasting despite being soaked in broth. The rice and macaroni salad were good sides to go with all the flavorful meat.  My order was made in a few short minutes. I washed everything down with a soda from the help-yourself soda fountain. They offer Pepsi products here, and the condiment section is right next to it with tartar sauce, ketchup, hot sauce, etc.  The combination meal was so hefty I could only finish about half of it. I'll have delicious leftovers for dinner tonight!"}
{"text":"Really good food! Service was awesome! Cashier was nice and friendly. Ordered the BBQ mix plate!! Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Food was good, made fresh! They do give you 10% if you check in (no online orders) Friendly staff"}
{"text":"Amazing. Great service, food and prices. Spam Masubi is one of my favs. The kalua pork is one of the best I've had and the portions are perfect."}
{"text":"The food was good but I have had way better, especially for the price. All their sauces were prepackaged, not impressed. Probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"This place stinks. Please go to Home Depot and buy some floor cleaner with a lot of suds and a long brush to clean the floors, sears and tables. Thank you."}
{"text":"Classic taste of the Hawaiian islands. It doesn't have that true authentic taste but on a scale of 1-10  I would give it a 7 on authenticity."}
{"text":"Can't even tell you how bad it was charged for a cup of water. 25cents.that wasn't even 2tbs.and way to much greens on my plate. Was 32dollars for 2 people. It's right across fom MCC.YOU would think it would  e ceeper to get the college kids in .:  ( ."}
{"text":"My go to Hawaiian food place. Haven't tried anything I havent liked here. The chicken katsu is excellent, the bbq is great and the fish and shrimp is good too. Excellent service and the price tag is reasonable for as much food you get."}
{"text":"The food here was amazingly good.  The Korean bbq ribs were my favorite.  You get a lot of food for your money.  Wife and I got the family meal and it's enough food for 4 people.  All orders come with cabbage,  but it's more of a garnish,  but they still pile it on."}
{"text":"Was at the college at lot longer than expected so we went across the street and ate here for dinner. Felt like simple homey food to us, not overly saucy or dolled up, and enjoyed it. Had pretty consistent customer traffic while we were there so I'm sure a lot more people enjoy it."}
{"text":"Never been to the actually place but I keep ordering this place for delivery... man it's like being back on the island, home cooked feel. I just wish they served a little more portions but it's still a good chunk of food compared to the other Hawaiian spots. I'm glad they do the spam right! And uhmmm.. I'm sure u can't go wrong with anything on the menu, but my go to dish here is def the chicken and shrimp with the spam musubi. Also plus they have the Hawaiian drinks just incase you was wondering!"}
{"text":"This is a good ppace for a quick and tasty meal. Stopped by during lunch, granted it wasn't busy but I was in and out (to go) in less than 10 minutes. I had the teriyaki chicken lunch plate, good portions. Includes chicken, rice, macaroni salad, and steamed cabbage, very reasonable for the 9.50. The food was pretty good. Nice place for quick good Hawaiian BBQ!"}
{"text":"Used to go to Ono Hawaiian BBQ but I started coming here when I moved closer. I never eat there but I always pick up and take it home for dinner! Kids love it and so do I! Delicious food and quick service, and way better than Ono!"}
{"text":"I was in the Dobson/Chandler Blvd area and was excited to see a Hawaiian restaurant. I ordered the Chicken and Kalua pork combo plate which came with rice and macaroni salad, as most Hawaiian plates do. The pork had no taste, the macaroni salad was dry and it had chunks of potato in it. The chicken part was a grilled thigh which I didn't eat because I don't like that part of the bird; my sister said it was \"okay\". The steamed rice and cabbage were fine. I doubt I'll eat there again."}
{"text":"My wife and I had the bbq mix and chicken and beef combos. The meat tastes soooo good! Thanks for a successful night out!"}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  Actually, 3.5 stars.  I like this place, but if I have to compare it to the best (that being in Hawai'i), I can't quite give it 4 stars yet.    First off, I will say that some of the dishes here are equal to if not better than some of the other Hawai'ian food in the Valley.  They also serve loco moco and spam moco, which not every Hawai'ian place in the valley serves.  They also have spam musubi and manapua regularly on their menu, where other places only have it occasionally.    BUT, no chicken long rice or lomi lomi salmon or lau lau.  Or true pipikaula.  They only have chicken katsu (no pork).  My dream is for a place in the Valley to have the whole range of traditional foods from Hawai'i.  As for the food, the kalua pork was quite good.  Nicely slightly salty and a good portion of it.  The mac salad was a little under-seasoned.  The loco moco was also a decent one, but average compared to the best that I had in Hawai'i.    There is really very little wrong with the food here, it is quite good.  The rating is based partially on stuff I wish they had that their competitors do, but also comparing the taste of their food to competitors nationwide.  I will definitely be back for whenever I need my quick Hawai'ian fix.  For value, this place is hard to beat.  Thus, 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday evening and got the family dinner for $35.99? Didn't seem worth the price at all. It's comes with 3 meat choices, we picked BBQ Chicken, BBQ beef, and Teriyaki Chicken. The meats weren't too bad, the teriyaki chicken was by far the best flavored meat! On the side comes steamed cabbage, 5 scoops of rice, and 5 scoops of macaroni salad. The cabbage tasted very good, esp the one mixed at the bottom of the teriyaki sauce with the chicken... but the macaroni salad, that's a different story. By far the worst Hawaiian macaroni salad I've had. This may be the only Hawaiian macaroni salad I've had that has potatoes along with tasting no where near as creamy as others, and I've had Mac straight from the source (Hawaii).  Also, your customer service is not good at all... the cashier,(Destiny) according to my receipt, does not have any bit of courteousness or respect to the easy job she does. While trying to order she's standing there with headphones in, when asking about meals she responds rudely and is pretty much just waiting for me to finish my order so she can go back to listening to music. Most likely will not be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"When you want some tasty HB this is the place to go to. Mac salad is on point, spam musubi is bomb. I always get the chicken combo w/ katsu and BBQ. I even eat the braised cabbage. Never lets me down. I just wish I lived closer so I can go more often. Hey that's an idea."}
{"text":"Delicious! Quick service but I had two hairs in my food. I'm not gonna complain too much because I liked the food"}
{"text":"Large portions. Ordered the teriyaki chicken and it was so gooood! It took about 10 minutes to get the food but other than that awesome"}
{"text":"If you have been here SKIP IT!  Everything tastes like it came out of package.  Even the Kalu pork was very salty the cabage was good for cutting some of the salt.  Next time I will drive the extra and go to Moki 's."}
{"text":"Ordered carryout through yelp, when I came in the casheir was pleasant and prompt, my food was ready minutes after arrival, despite my being early. The food itself was delicious."}
{"text":"So I have i have I need to order something new every time i come in. My normal go to is the bbq beef, truly amazing. The meat is always so tender a s full of  flavor. This time I went with the lemon pepper chicken with all steamed cabbage. I was pleasantly surprised. The meat was exploding with flavor. Very fresh taste, they even five you lemon slices with your meal."}
{"text":"Portion size is small compared to Ono Hawaiian BBQ. Only got one thin piece of bbq rib in the bbq mix plate. Mac salad tastes different than other Hawaiian BBQ places."}
{"text":"If you own a business it is your job to always make sure your customers are satisfied point blank. All I asked if she could please let me order a bowl of curry chicken because I was interested on trying it she refused and said it must be a lunch plate ... mind you I had no interest in macaroni or cabbage so what sense would that make for me to order a plate? Anyways I will never return because first impressions can always be the last they should definitely work on making the customer happy ...."}
{"text":"The food is usually good.  New updated decor.  The Cashier (Female, 30's, Mexican/East Indian?) has absolutely no customer rapport whatsoever.  Maybe she gets paid minimum wage and doesn't really like Hawaiian food but I wish they hire someone else so maybe she's happier elsewhere.  Feel jilted tipping because of such bad customer service from this particular Cashier."}
{"text":"Best Hawaiian BBQ! Way better than Ono's Hawaiian BBQ! Try it out"}
{"text":"It was our first time here and they did not disappoint! I got the bbq combo and my boyfriend got the katsu and pork combo and they were amazing! I can't wait to go back, I definitely recommend this place. Walking in already feels comfortable and the service is great. The food took a minute but it was definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I have nothing against the food, but I'm starting to get annoyed by the service. Came by last week before tennis to grab a quick snack. Wanted one order of BBQ Chicken Musubi, but the cashier rang me up for two orders. Once I caught the mistake on the screen, it was already too late since he already swiped my credit card. He told me to wait a few minutes for the owner to come by and issue the refund.  I patiently waited for the owner to come. Once he arrived, I told him I'm willing to take a gift card/certificate to save him some credit card transaction fees (otherwise he would have been charge twice for issuing the refund and processing a new transaction). He happily agreed and went to the back to write me a gift certificate of the exact amount I was overcharged.   Fast forward to this week. I went in with intent to use the gift certificate. The cashier had no clue what to do with it. Although annoyed, I purchased the meal at full price and enjoyed it.   I'm not sure I'd be coming back just from being annoyed by this experience. A message to the owner, consider hiring a restaurant manager that can handle customer issues if you're not planning to be on-site during business hours. Better yet, instruct your cashiers on how to accept your own issued gift certificates."}
{"text":"ok, 3.5 Stars,, 4 for the staff explaining everything,,  Tried both Chicken and the Beef BBQ options and both were good,, def not the BEST ever, but better than most other places. If you're craving Hawaiian and in the area, then its worth it !! Right down the street from me, so we will stop by once in awhile for sure... I like it better than Aloha on Alms N Guadalupe... so,, take it as you prefer. !!"}
{"text":"The BBQ Chicken is amazing! Combined with the mac salad and rice it makes the perfect dinner. The service was really good even on a busy Monday night during their rush."}
{"text":"Great place, super clean. Food came out hot, tasty and well made. Both BBQ Chicken and Teriyaki Chicken were good. I'll be coming back again for sure."}
{"text":"The curry chicken they make is so bomb I tear up a little every time I eat it and the macaroni salad is to die for!! The macaroni salad is the best part of the meal! Who ever makes my food deserves all the happiness in the world I love you"}
{"text":"The food is really good and fresh the only down part was I think there air conditioner was broken and it was really hot and humid inside. Definitely will come back but when the air conditioner gets fixed"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch had the Kalua pork plate lunch (9.25). . Lunch menu was prices pretty much hard to swallow along with the macaroni salad. Asked for two scoops of macaroni salad instead of two scoops of rice. it looks like one scoop of rice one scoop of macaroni salad.overall nothing to Rave about..... Meh"}
{"text":"This place was just over A-OK.  I guess I'm spoiled coming from a lot of Island inspired houses but they're really lacking in a couple key essentials.   Parking: Really good, a lot of space in the lot  Service: Everything was quick but there was just not a homey feeling there at all. At a place like this especially family owned you want to feel welcomed.  Food: I got the 1/2 bbq chicken & 1/2 katsu. The breading on the katsu was ok but they did a really bad job at cutting it to keep it intact. The bbq chicken was also just ok. Had some descent flavor but i can make a better one at home. Same thing with the mac salad. I'm notorious for getting double mac and one scoop of rice. The mac just seemed to be sitting for a bit. Especailly with that type of mac you gotta make sure it stays really cold or the milk in it will start to cause a tarty taste.   Probably won't be going back again."}
{"text":"I agree with another reviewer regarding skimpy rice, in addition to sub par rice quality.  It kinda ruined it for my spam musubi order.    I may try the teriyaki or Katsu next time.  We had the BBQ chicken, and it was okay."}
{"text":"This place is the best!! The food is great and the service is great as well! If you want Hawaiian bbq, this will definitely hit the spot for you! You don't need to make any reservations! Just walk in, order, wait, and eat! My family and I ordered the chicken katsu, Bbq mix, and the bbq beef noodle soup! All amazing! We only had 4 people eat and it was more than enough! Great place and I know for sure I'll be coming back soon!!"}
{"text":"First review of 2017! I was in the mood for Hawaiian food so I came here for lunch to try it out.   I ordered the chicken Katsu mini meal which came with Mac salad. The mini meal is a good portion if you're not a big eater like me. The chicken Katsu was actually pretty good. It was very crispy. I didn't enjoy the Mac salad though. It was very bland which was a disappointment.   If you check in on Yelp you also get 10% off your order. I would come back to try some other dishes or get the chicken Katsu. But you'll want to pass on the Mac salad. =("}
{"text":"Had a pick up order just before close around 930pm. I've had many Hawaii BBQ places and the food and price were mediocre.   BBQ Mix for $12 is not a great value when I saw how much meat they actually put in there. The owner could reduce the price on all the boxes by at least $1- $2 and still make great profit margins. The taste was okay, just what you would expect but nothing exciting.  I actually prefer Ono Hawaiian a chain place over this one."}
{"text":"Very, very, very good!!! Friendly and nice employees and very tasty food. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"No, thank you. Took my husband out to lunch last Sunday and this place was new (to us) and right by his job. We're trying to branch out so instead of heading to KFC or McDonald's (which are close-by too) we tried this place. I wouldn't say I instantly regretted our decision but half way through the meal I felt bad that my husband would be going back to work hungry and dissatisfied. We ordered the pineapple chicken meal which comes with white rice and macaroni salad and I ordered an egg roll on the side. The mac salad was good and so was chicken itself but as a meal, it was so underwhelming. I'm not sure what I was imagining but when we ordered the pineapple chicken it was just chicken katsu with a pineapple/sweet and tangy sauce. I thought it was going to be chicken cooked in the sauce but okay, no big deal. The chicken with the sauce was really flavorful and crispy but the rice was so bland. It had no taste whatsoever. The egg roll was gross and it was still cold in the middle. My husband asked to try it against his better judgment and my suggestion and ended up spitting it out. It was so dense and filled with mostly vegetables and barely any meat all. I think it was probably old. The reviews for Golden Hawaiian BBQ are all over the place so I guess when they're on, they're really on but we must have came on an off day. I'm glad we tried to it for the sake of the ~experience since I've never had Hawaiian food but we won't be back."}
{"text":"So we ended up back in Chandler because the restaurant we originally was going to was closed due to an emergency.   The menu was extensive and the prices were high for what you get. I will say the food was really good but as you can see in my picture the plate was filled with lettuce at the bottom. I usually opt for mini plates at Hawaiian restaurants because the portions are usually really big. In this case I got a regular size in hopes I had leftovers for dinner. Sad to say I ate almost everything. Boo! No dinner.   Anyway, even though the portions were smaller than I'm used to I'll still go back to try something else since it was tasty!"}
{"text":"WOW!!! Found egg shell in my food. We decided to order & have it delivered but was very disappointed. We all ordered a plate with deep fry items & none of the came with any sauce. What is katsu without a katsu sauce... What good is seafood mix (deep fry shrimp & deep fry fish) without a tartar sauce. Shrimp was very over dry from over cooked. Bulgogi was marinated too long giving it a jerky look & taste. Macaroni salad was a bit plain. Perdect amount of mayo but lacking in everything else. BBQ chicken was good as usual."}
{"text":"Small hole in the wall place but it brings close to home in some way. Since L & L is no where near by it's difficult to get my craving fixed. Little slow but food isn't awful.  Some plates aren't really Hawaiian style but much like it. If the server/hostess/cashier was a bit welcoming, I think many locals from Hawaii might visit."}
{"text":"Wake up in the morning feeling like P.Diddy... and a Hilo Boy [Am I talking about Cafe 100's dish or Matt C.!?]  Anyways, so I came here today for lunch instead of the usual boring Hawaiian BBQ place that's half a mile away from home.  I had Yelp'd for some nearby locations for Hawaiian and saw that this place was decently close.  Loving Yelp.  After checking out their menu online, I saw they had a Loco Moco and that sealed the deal for me.  I needed some Hilo-lovin' and dangit, I wanted it NOW!  The place itself is really small but very clean.  Service was friendly and the chef actually took my order on top of preparing the most sexy over-easy eggs [I'm telling ya.... lava flow of egg yolk, oh my!].  Located inside a strip mall with a smoke shop next door and Jimmy John's and Cheba Hut nearby, I stumbled in and ordered me a Loco Moco and some spam musubi to-go.    It was love at first bite.  Ever since Ono's discontinued their Loco Moco, I've been craving me some runny egg yolks, gravy, and hamburger like no other.  For their Loco Moco alone, I'll forever be a patron at Golden Hawaiian BBQ."}
{"text":"44,000 cans of SPAM are produced every hour worldwide to be consumed in more than 40 countries. That's a lot of SPAM!  I was lying in bed today when Myke Y. sent me a delicious looking picture of some SPAM and eggs.  Because of him, I had SPAM on the mind!  I've been noticing this Golden Hawaiian BBQ place recently and had been wondering if it was owned by the same owners as the Southern & Dobson Hawaiian BBQ joint with the same name --- it is, based off what one of the staff said.  Cool.  I like that place too and now I don't have to walk by a sketchy smoke shop and a bar to get my Hawaiian eats!  I got myself a Loco Moco and some Spam Musubi on the side.  While the eggs were cooked a little more than I would have liked, everything was delicious just as it is in their other location.  The Spam was cooked crispy and I was a happy happy girl.  Portions were decent and I spent a little less than $30 for two entrees, an order of spam musubi, and two drinks.    Come here for some decent eats!"}
{"text":"Family owned but no personal touch to the food. If you have been to one generic Hawaiian BBQ place, you've been here. The food is slightly over priced but the service is pretty quick. I really only come here when I need a break from the usual."}
{"text":"The Loco Moco is AMAZING!!  This is my new favorite place to get Hawaiian bbq.. Must try"}
{"text":"I normally never write 1 star reviews. But this 1 star is for terrrrrrible customer service. The cashier named Stephany was rude, snotty and seemed like she did not want to be there. It was my first time there so I asked for any recommendations her response was \"I don't know\" and rolled her eyes at me. I came in the door at 9:50 PM and they closed at 10 I asked if it was still okay for me to order her response was \"sure we close in several minutes.\" I have never met or ran into service like this. Food overall was decent but the service I got from Stephany I'll definitely be going to Ono Hawaiian instead."}
{"text":"Very good! We got the chicken Katsu and pineapple chicken plates. Both were great. Also the spam musubi was pretty good. I'm hawaiian and have been desperate for my fix of good food in the mainland. This hit the spot. Basically, is exactly like L&L. Probably the exact same recipes; sure tastes like it! Probably not the same quality as what you'd actually get IN Hawaii though...the food in the islands is ALWAYS better. But good for mainland standards. Will satisfy my cravings for the time being."}
{"text":"I've always loved soamoa cookies and thought to myself that if the lands as good as the cookie set your mind on a new romance because that's where I'm headed.   Golden Hawaiian BBQ has brought me back to the one true island of the United States. Hawaii. The rice here is the best rice I've ever had. Complimented by deliciously grilled chicken covered in teriyaki. I've uber eats them and it's always prepared very nicely. And the staff inside the restaurant is really friendly  and it's clean.   Doesn't get. 5 star because I occasionally get a piece of chicken fat. I don't like that maybe some people do. But other than that it's primo. Would go there again."}
{"text":"We ordered over the phone for pick-up which was a great idea. Not much seating inside so take-away is the way to go! Food was delish. Spam musubi was fresh, lightly salted, and very flavorful. The chicken katsu was fried to a crispy-crunchy exterior with tender juicy white meat chicken within. The kalbi short ribs were flavorful (albeit a bit fatty) but super tasty. Steamed rice was good, mac salad was decent, and the cabbage was great! Can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"Honestly the first time it was very good when I went to the tattoo place next door! Then I just came here today and the teriyaki chicken was was really squshy and didn't really taste right... like really cheap chicken! The Asian lady got all upset when I was getting water from her machine? We live in Arizona!!!"}
{"text":"Our party ordered chicken katsu, pineapple chicken, and kalbi short ribs - Positives: The food stayed hot and the sides of rice, cabbage, and macaroni salad were good. The sauces with the chicken were delicious.   Negatives:The chicken was virtually tasteless. All of the meats were exceptionally greasy. The ribs were about 90% fat and gristle, although what little meat there was tasted good.  Considering the ribs are the most expensive thing on the menu @ $12.95, the mere tablespoon or two of meat they provided made this grossly overpriced.  Overall, we were quite disappointed and won't return."}
{"text":"Ok, but have had better.  Katsu sauce too watered down and Mac salad has no taste."}
{"text":"Best Hawaiian food in Chandler. Now that I moved I'll miss this place. Anything you get from there is amazing!!"}
{"text":"I was going to order food but the man was pulling the garbage and I watched him wash his hands and not use soap. That is a health code violation. That's gross!"}
{"text":"Don't come here. The owner Stanley is mean as hell.  This is not a place for yelpers, especially if you like taking photos. It has been so long since I've written a one star review and here it is...........  I was so excited about coming here since it is closed to my house.  As soon as we arrived,  I started taking photos wanting to share my dining experience with my fellow yelpers (like I've always done at any restaurant I've been to). While waiting for my food and wanting to snap a photo of their menus for my next visit,  the owner showed up from the kitchen saying this,  \"this is my restaurant and you need my permission to take photos \". I was in complete shocked and felt insulted.  I basically told him that I simply wanted to upload photos to share on yelps.  If he has a problem with that,  don't worry I am deleting them right now and walked away.  I was royally pissed off because of the approach he used to speak with me.  During my whole meal, the owner and the guy in the kitchen kept peaking over giving us dirty looks.  The poor guy at the cashier who took our order was lectured by the owner about how to handle similar situation.  I wouldn't be surprised if they split on our food.  I basically took a few bites of my order and trashed the rest away.    Business owner who acts like this shouldn't be in business.  If you want complete privacy,  DON'T BE IN BUSINESS!!!!  P.S.  After completing some research online,  no wonder he was freaked.  This restaurant has health violation cited few weeks ago : https://www.maricopa.gov/EnvSvc/OnlineApplication/EnvironmentalHealth/FoodInspection?p=FD-46150&i=3954053"}
