{"text":"Such a cute and clean environment. Loved the new renovations, assuming there's been a change of ownership? The burger menu is still being served but they also introduced an all-day breakfast and bubble tea! Love the new place. The prices are really good as well and so was the Chinese man that made the food. He was very accomodating and super friendly. I highly recommend this place to try!"}
{"text":"If someone asks me why do I give 4- star to a small shop like this... I say, because my ratings are for more than just how pricey the place looks... cough or how fancy a place is. A \"Michelin\" star restaurant with nasty service would be 1 star.   QC Cafe is small, convenient, one of a few Boba places north of Richmond Hill or Markham area, and  and run by people who still see their customers as patrons, not creatures who bother them with their food and drink orders. This is not a fancy place which spends ads expenses. You want burger? Okay. Fries? Okay. Poutine? Okay, they have cut fries, gravy, and cheese curds. Bam: poutine.   I got boba and poutine. It was not the cheapest and not the most pricey in this area. It satisfied my Boba cravings and poutine IN ONE trip! Love it. My order came late and the staff apologized. I realized late that I came around closing time, silly of me. Like I said, they are nice about it.    You can see the kitchen where they cook and prepare the boba. The fryer is there, small stove, and gravy warmed up for the poutine are the essentials they have displayed to the customers. My only selfish wish is for them to put congee on the menu, and would come here more. Joking.   They have slices of cake which I thought were handy. They have the Japanese cheesecake or something, amongst the desserts.   Overall, I would come back and try their burger."}
{"text":"Bubble tea drinks are good.  Crispy chicken burger is good.  Poutine is ok.  Ceasar salad ... Is a No for me. It was basically head lettuce chopped up.  Service is good!  Place is a bit small for big groups.  Men's bathroom door does not lock.  3stars overall."}
