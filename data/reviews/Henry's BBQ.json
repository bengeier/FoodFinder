{"text":"I moved to Linden in 1979, my family owned two local motels (Grandview & Valley View).  My family and I, loved eating at Henry's BBQ.  My late father and I would work all day in the yard, and come to Henry's for lunch.  I moved away in 1988 to join the US Army, and my family moved from the area in 1990....BUT....when ever I'm in the Williamsport/Linden area, I ALWAYS GO BACK TO HENRY'S BBQ.
It's not your normal style BBQ, they have their own take on it, the sandwiches are AWESOME!  Henry's has been their foreverrrrrr, so if you are ever in the area, check them out, you won't be disappointed.
Man, I'm making myself hungry just thinking about their food.  God Bless Henry's BBQ and the crew, thanks for all the memories as a kid, when I come and eat there, it brings back good memories of my Dad.

A Fan Forever,

{"text":"Not a true barbecue restaurant. If you're not originally from the area, the name is deceiving. Not much on the menu either and the service was slow. If you are looking for true Southern style BBQ, this is not the place."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!!! I was born here and my mom still makes ham BBQ just like Henry's. We don't get back much but we always stop here. We moved to NC and yes it's not \"southern\" BBQ but it's very good, great food, awesome shakes, friendly service and a long history. Thanks Henry's!"}
{"text":"Not a barbecue place. Not even a good lunch place. Very disappointed after seeing the high reviews it got. My turkey barbecue sandwich was sliced turkey warmed up with no sauce, no smiley flavor."}
{"text":"Excellent \"Henry's \". BBQ.  It is not ketchup buried sauce.  It is true bbq sauce of a different kind.  I have been eating it for over 50 yrs.  when someone says chili dogs are better....that person doesn't have much going for them in recognizing food qualities.  I love the ham but most like he Canadian bacon!"}
{"text":"Their barbecue isn't really barbecue... More like warm meat with relish BUT they have homemade coleslaw and a steak and Ale soup that is killer!"}
