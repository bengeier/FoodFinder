{"text":"Pricing and flavor can't be beat. I recommend just getting take out, as the service here is very slow."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! My favorite Chinese food of all time!! I have yet to find a place that beats it!"}
{"text":"I get takeout quite often, I thought I noticed something in the rice that looked like a maggot previously but tonight I was positive. I got out the magnifying glass to make sure since a tiny worm looks similar to a piece of fried rice. I do not plan on telling Lin but I can no longer eat the food."}
{"text":"The best kept secret in the Northills. Great food and very reasonable. Check out their lunch specials, they can't be beat. I use to swear by the Sesame Inn on McKnight rd. This is head and shoulders better and worth the drive."}
{"text":"Being new to the area I was very excited to try this place.  As much as I really wanted to like it I ended up disappointed.  My family ordered some standards, shrimp fried rice, ginger beef, and kung pao chicken.  To be fair the fried rice was quite good, however the ginger beef was battered and fried (I've never seen it served that way before). As for the chicken, there was very little actual chicken, and what there was of it was low quality meat.  The service was good and friendly and the dining area is nicer that many chinese places.  I might grab some fried rice for takeout sometime, but I will not be a regular customer."}
{"text":"I've come to Lin's very often ever since they've opened.  This summer, I've come almost on a weekly basis.  My three mainstays are the Shrimp with Broccoli (in a great dark sauce), the Seafood Supreme (that might not be the name of it, but it's on the Chef's Special menu) and the Dry Sauteed String Beans.  The latter two of those three are always a little bland, at least compared to authentic Sichuan dry sauteed string beans in the beans' case, but with a little salt or soy sauce, both dishes are tasty.  My picky brother always orders shrimp fried rice with no vegetables and wonton soup with no green onions, and he is always easily understood and accommodated.    As has been mentioned, their lunch specials are relatively generous portions for a good price, so stop by for lunch.  My one and only complaint with Lin's is that their food is not that great leftover.  I would order take-out, and the quality of the food paled in comparison to eating it there.  So do yourself a favor and just eat it in the restaurant.  The decor is authentic, they keep the same instrumental CD playing on loop, and it is overall a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"The amazing chicken is the best in Pittsburgh.  Get the dinner portion with crab Rangoon and you'll be in heaven.  The portion size is great. i never eat there.  I always pick up and the service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Amazing every time! We moved here a year ago and have Lins every other week! Fresh lrg shrimp and pork fried rice are great!"}
{"text":"I have tried most of the Chinese restaurants in the Northern area.  Lin's Garden is, hands down, my favorite.  The food AND the service are consistently good."}
{"text":"It reminds me of the old fashioned Chinese Kitchen type place my parents would get take out from in the 70s.  I love it"}
{"text":"Love it. Some of the best Chinese food around, with a cute & calm atmosphere inside, or very prompt take-out. Never disappointed here, and highly recommend the Amazing Chicken. Much cheaper at lunch than at dinner, but each portion is easily 2-3 meals! Neighborhood gem!"}
{"text":"Relaxed and comfortable atmosphere, good family place.  Menu had all the classics and some unique dish offerings.  Could have went in a lot of different directions with the ordering.  Staff  accommodated a ginger broccoli dish. The broccoli was cooked perfectly!  Healthy stalks and was crisp.  Pieces of ginger in the sauce.  Eggplant and chicken dish in garlic sauce was great.  Our 4 year old shoveled his food in, couldn't get enough!  Want to try the Singapore rice noodles next time.  Other tables seemed to be enjoying their food and the broccoli and green bean dishes came out of the kitchen especially good-looking. Portions of all dishes were generous and led to leftovers.  Lo mein had too much oil and oil could have been reduced on all 3 dishes we ordered but that is common with most Chinese restaurants.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We had the Steamed Dumplings and Triple Delight.  Both were excellent.  Service was swift and friendly.  Very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Just went to Lins tonight.  We were a large party of 10.  The service was wonderful, the staff friendly and more than efficient.  The food is authentic, hot and delicious.  Wow.  Don't miss this restaurant.  We will definitely go back....and SOON."}
{"text":"Lin's is OK Chinese food. They have a big selection and a good lunch deal. They also deliver SUPER fast. I mean you order and 15 minutes later your food arrives. I've never seen a place deliver fast actually.  They give a good portion size and the lunch deal comes with either soup or an egg roll also. It is a very inexpensive meal when you are really wanting Chinese.  I usually will get the Amazing Chicken, which is sweet and spicy crispy fried white meal chicken. It is VERY good! I tried General Tso's chicken once and I was expecting the same white meat with the different sauce, but it was mostly dark meat chicken. It was really fatty and just not appetizing. I later found out you can ask for just white meat for a small up-charge. Personally I just do not like that meat or quality, which is why my rating is lower.  Over-all I think it is a good inexpensive choice but I think there are better quality choices in the area for this type of food."}
{"text":"Really good Chinese food! I hadn't been here until today since there are so many options for Chinese on Route 8 and this one sits back a bit. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food! I had General Tso's Chicken and Crab Rangoons. The inside of the place was a bit dated, but you can the family that owns the place takes a lot of pride in their business."}
{"text":"It's ok.  But honestly there isn't a lot of really good Chinese in the area so you're kinda stuck.  I think golden star is better but not by much."}
{"text":"Called to order delivery was told I didn't order delivery then they finally delivered me cold food. Hmmmm when you call and they answer and you say I would like to place an order for delivery I believe that means you want it delivered ... But since the young girl on the phone wasn't paying attention I was told I didn't order delivery and their response is after waiting 45 min is do you want it delivered or not .. Then they arrive with cold food. Love to be called a liar .. It's a shame cuz I ate there all the time and spent a lot of money there ... They should have made fresh food a delivered it instead of calling me a liar and bringing  cold food.. What a shame !!"}
{"text":"This has been our \"Go to\" for the last 5 years. We order usually once a week for take away. During the school year, this is my child free lunch place. Lately the food has been layered in oil?? The egg rolls are ? Heavy, not crispy? I placed a take away today, had the order repeated several times, but we did not receive fried potstickers?"}
{"text":"First of all, if you can find this place you deserve a gold star. It's in a small area behind some buildings off Route 8 northbound. Not visible at all. Yeah, there's a small sign on Route 8 but by the time you see it, it's too late to turn. Luckily you can hang a right at the light and circle back around.   The food? Well, it's strip mall Chinese food. Don't look for elegant, refined dining. But you knew that, right? The atmosphere is not impressive, a few booths and some tables, some typical Chinese decorations to remind you you're in a Chinese restaurant, etc. But that's not why you're here.  I have to say, the food is pretty good! Hot and sour soup is tasty and better than many I've had. The pork and garlic sauce was decent, sort of average to be honest. But here's where they pick up a star. The lunch menu is mostly $5.95 for a bowl of soup or salad, an egg roll and a pretty big (almost entree size) portion. That's a deal.   If you're hungry and craving Chinese, you'd do well to find your way here!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite hometown Chinese places! Lin's garden is right down the street from me so I have been going here for almost 15 years now. Its safe to say I haven't had Hunan chicken that is better anywhere else. My typical meal is an egg roll and Hunan chicken delivered. Stop in before 3pm and get their lunch special which is very affordable."}
{"text":"I have eaten lunch there twice and delicious both times.  Great lunch prices and serving size is enough for another meal later if take home.  Clean and good service.  Will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Stop here for lunch every two weeks or so, great deal.  Portions are enough to have a second meal or late night snack.  Usually get the amazing chicken, which is basically white meat general tso. Definitely the best Chinese in the area."}
{"text":"I was hoping this would be our weekly Sunday dinner because it is right next to where my daughter has softball practice on Sunday nights.  I was dissapointed with the food.  We ordered the Velvet Chicken and Kung Pao chicken.  Both were pretty bland.  The spring rolls, however were very good.  I will give the place another chance, but based on other reviews, I expected a lot better."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years.  Favorite Chinese food of all time no matter which city I have lived in."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in the area. The serving sizes are huge, and the quality of the meat is excellent. Amazing chicken is my go to; never fails to impress people when they visit. Superb service when you dine in, and friendly when they deliver."}
{"text":"My wife and I frequent this place relatively often as it is the best Chinese in the Gibsonia area (if you want delivery or a reasonable snag for take out).     The food here is served quickly and is of much higher quality than the other nearby Chinese dining establishments that pretty much serve the cookie cutter \"mall Chinese\"  It's good to have a difference in choice that focuses more on the quality.       The only downside on this place is that their delivery practices are erratic and inconsistent.   Sometimes when I call delivery is unavailable or the amounts for minimum.  This isn't a huge problem because my house is up the road a bit, but odd still."}
{"text":"When I went in to pick up our order to go, I was pleasantly surprised how cute this place is!  The boiled pork dumplings were very good!  We also got Amazing Chicken, Chicken with Broccoli (1 of my favorites) and Kung Pao Chicken (Nick's favorite).....everything was cooked to perfection!!   You must try!!!"}
{"text":"This is my Chinese restaurant. When you order to go it always takes 10 minutes. It has always been ready when we arrived. We like to eat there too. The decor is lacking but the food is pretty good. I have enjoyed most things there. There has been things that were good but not the flavor I was looking for.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Exceptionally good Chinese food. My family has been Lin's customers for years. I have never had a bad dish. Amazing Chicken is their signature dish, and really lives up to its name. I also love their sweet and sour chicken, fried rice, egg rolls, and crab rangoons. The atmosphere is nice, and it's great for take out too. Very generous portions and a friendly staff."}
{"text":"I would give it 0 stars if I could.  The place is EXTREMELY unprofessional.  I called because their Chow Mein doesn't have noodles, which is the first time I have seen that.  I may be wrong about this but clarification should be given.  Also ordered the Sweet Broccoli and was sent Broccoli with Garlic Sauce and was given the excuse of \"It's not spicy\" for their reasoning of sending me this.  AND LAST BUT CERTAINLY NOT LEAST!!! THE LADY HELPING ME HUNG UP ON ME CAUSE SHE SAID THEY WERE \"BUSY\"!!! THIS WAS ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS!! How does a restaurant hang up on a paying customer when they have an issue with the order that the restaurant sent them?!?!?!  If the food was the best Chinese food I ever had I would be a little more okay with it...but the food is mediocre at best.  DO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT!!!!"}
{"text":"Nothing to brag about here. Hit it on a slow night, and service was fast and good. Typical American style Chinese food. I tried the sizzling triple delight. It was cooked well, a good sized portion, but in a rather bland, yet salty and almost hot sauce. It could stand to be kicked up with some Ginger, or something.  Just what you'd expect from an American style Chinese restaurant. But then there is not much in the Asian styles to chose from around the area."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant.  Hands down.  The sauces taste properly seasoned with real garlic and spices.  The General Tso's tofu is out of this world!  I highly recommend everything here."}
{"text":"Tasty, authentic Chinese food. If you want to know what real Chinese food tastes like, eat here. The dumplings are to die for, and the lo mein will always be a staple of my diet."}
