{"text":"The atmosphere is wonderful and very clean but, very busy. The wait staff very friendly which is a BIG plus for me.  We went for Sunday breakfast.  Me, husband and our little one (3 yrs old). The food was huge!!!  The food was delicious!  The pancakes and hashbrowns and my egg omlet ...Julia pancake was shaped like a face..she loved it. Did I mention wait staff...she came back offer us extra napkins and more coffee and we didnt even have to ask...WONDERFUL!!! We will GO BACK! 
After we ate we went back to bed... lol We were stuffed.. :)"}
{"text":"I regularly go to this place. It's not fancy and it doesn't blow you out of the park, but it's good food that's satisfying. Coffee is nothing special but it's hot. Food is diner quality. Waitresses are friendly.

I recommend the Irish Benedict with corned beef."}
{"text":"Busy Busy Busy!!!  good for them! We were seated right away and had orange juice and coffee on the table very quickly. Server was attentive, nice and courteous. Breakfast was hot and delicious. It seems like a lot of locals frequent this place. The table beside us was set and had water on for a family who was on their way. Always glad to see a small mom and pop restaurant busy. Again, good for them!!!  want to go back for supper!!!"}
{"text":"Place is packed. One cook working, so the wait was insane. Coffee is terrible, food is terrible (bacon is super thin and has an odd taste, eggs runny, corn beef has is mushy and straight out of a can, hash browns dripping with butter). Friendly waitresses are rushing around trying to keep hungry and impatient people happy. Won't be back."}
{"text":"The fried chicken is absolutely fantastic and the mashed potatoes are home made! I could eat it every day if you let me. The staff is also very friendly and attentive. And since my Granny was not only from Alabama, but ran a restaurant and school cafeteria back when everything was from scratch you know I know what good fried chicken tastes like!"}
{"text":"I just moved to the Stow area and I saw a lot of cars in the parking lot at Tip Top on a Saturday morning and thought I would give their breakfast a try. I'm glad I did! They have really good blueberry pancakes and scrambled eggs. I got my food quickly and service was very good."}
{"text":"My go to spot when I want breakfast for lunch or need a quiet relaxed atmosphere.  Super friendly staff and fantastic, feel good food.  One of my favorite places to eat!"}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting much, and I wasn't surprised by the poor quality of the food. We visited around 2pm on a Saturday when it wasn't very busy. I ordered an Inferno Burger done medium. The food I received was well done at best, and the fries worth excitement. Our party of six waited for around a half hour for our food. I remained unimpressed by the eggs and other breakfast items that my table ordered.

I definitely wouldn't recommend this place, as guests can find food of the same quality elsewhere at fast-food prices. My rating bottoms out at two stars because of the decent view of trees and the river out of the main window, which I consider the best part of the experience."}
{"text":"Had the beef stroganoff tonight and it was pretty good. I'm glad I've decided to try Tip Top again. They have turned things around have have pretty decent food again. 

I have recently have had their chicken alfredo and it was pretty good too. The fried mushrooms are pretty decent too. 

The portions are good sized and the prices are good for the size of the portions."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant. The service is always great, food is wonderful and the prices are fair. Your glass is never left empty, dishes are cleared out promptly, and you never leave hungry!"}
{"text":"Great Diner Food.
Good food, quick service. Great Strawberry Shortbread.
Good Prices, Some good daily Specials."}
{"text":"I really love this place. Dive type breakfast, sassy waitresses that have been doing it long enough to do it well. Great breakfast food, quick to refill my diet coke (a must). I really like the wacky scenes that are always happening outside the huge window. Tons of birds and little animals. Kinda weird, but it's my favorite breakfast place!"}
{"text":"I got a southern western omelette and a side of hash browns with poeppers onions, cheese.  The omelette was greasy too little egg and too much filling.  The hash browns had way too much cheese layered on top that it ruined them imo.  I give 1 star because the coffee was ok."}
{"text":"The service here has always been great. I've always liked anything that I've ordered. The Pecan Chicken Salad is one of my favorite lunches."}
{"text":"Delicious food, and the waitresses are attentive and kind. We love going here for lunch or dinner. The fries are awesome!"}
{"text":"I think the prices are great. Family restaurant. Decent food."}
{"text":"The restaurant is a very quaint little restaurant that sits along nature path.  Looking out at nature as you dine.  It's very sweet,  the food is good.  The waitress that we had Portia, was absolutely fabulous , so yes I recommend this place"}
{"text":"Great old fashioned diner food. Breakfast is tasty and for a good price. My parents insist on coming here. If you are in the mood for the classics, this is s good choice."}
{"text":"We recently moved to the area and couldn't hardly wait to try this cute little restaurant!  We were not disappointed and have returned many times!  We have been there for breakfast and recently tried the \"all you can eat chicken\".  It was delicious.  The staff is very friendly and great service."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here for breakfast today on our way to Kent, he said he used to come here when he was a kid and always loved it. Well, all I can say is that I didn't love it....at all. First off the prices are ridiculous! I paid $8.00 for an egg, sausage, and cheese sandwich on a bagel! The sandwich was supposed to come with hash browns, I asked if there were other sides and was given the option of applesauce or cottage cheese...they don't have fruit cups??? The sandwich was bland, basically tasteless and the bagel tasted more like a hamburger bun. My husband enjoyed his meal of 3 huge pancakes, eggs, sausage, and hash browns, which was only $9 and made me wonder why mine was so expensive????  The coffee was weak, the water tasted strange, but our server was very nice and attentive. There are water stains and mold growing on the ceiling tiles and in the bathroom. It cost $26 for the two of us with our food and coffees!!! Not worth it!!! We won't be back!!!"}
{"text":"I came in here once and reviewed the bathrooms to see if they were any better, my conclusion nope some of the crap on the floor and walls is still there new photos to update it. I hope the kitchen isn't the same but"}
{"text":"I've had breakfast here several times in the last few months and every time has been great.  It's classic diner food, nothing fancy, very tasty and plenty of it.  The service is fine and the prices are good too.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"They do serve a great breakfast and usually have a special during the AM ! Fast, friendly service. Medium price range.

{"text":"I visited this diner on a Sunday around 2 p.m., they close at 3 p.m. on Sunday's.  I gave them 4 stars for good service, quality fresh food and reasonable price.  I ordered a build your own omelette with egg beaters spinach, broccoli, mushrooms and feta cheese. I also had an English Muffin that came with the omelette and hash browns cooked well done for $1.99 extra.  My husband ordered a Western Omelette with white toast and hash browns cooked well done.   I have to say this is the first diner that cooked our hash browns the right way.  Most places the hash browns are still under cooked with no crispiness.  I could tell that the vegetables in my omelette were fresh and not frozen, this was an automatic plus for me.  The service was fast and friendly.  Compared to that Cafe in Stow (awful) that I tried last week, this was SO MUCH BETTER!!! I would visit this place again."}
{"text":"I used to enjoy breakfasts here but the quality varies so wildly that I can't recommend the place. Timing of breakfast items seems off. For example, on my last two visits the toast and bacon were cold because we had asked for crispy hash browns. Coffee ranges from good to poor. 

On the bright side, staff is always friendly and attentive and the view in the booths by the windows is nice."}
{"text":"My wife and I were visiting the Stow area and were in search of a place to get lunch. We happened upon Tip Top Restaurant and Catering. It's a nicely appointed place with a pleasant staff. We were seated in one of the booths along the back wall that over looked a nice outdoor area with flowers and bird feeders. We were entertained by birds, chipmunks and what may have been a gopher or some such. We only saw his head as he popped up to eat some morning glory flowers. 
So now to the meal. I ordered the BLT with extra bacon (cuz why not) and instead of fries I went for the fried mushrooms. My wife had the country fried steak with hash browns. Our food arrived in about 10 minutes. The BLT was stuffed with bacon, nice lettuce and thick sliced tomatoes. The bread was toasted a bit dark, but not burnt. I only mention this because the waitstaff brought it to my attention and offered to remake it if I wanted. I told them it was no problem at all. The fried mushrooms were whole, which I really like. They were also very tasty with a nice crispy coating. A side of ranch dressing was provided. The country fried steak was cooked nicely golden brown and covered with white gravy. My wife said it was delicious too! We were checked on often enough to not need anything. 
All in all this was a very good experience and we will return here when back in town. So if you're looking for a nice place to eat for not a lot of money (our full bill was $25) then this is the place to visit!"}
{"text":"Giving it a three because was disappointed in the prime rib. Ordered it medium rare, and was no way that! No red in the middle. 
Staff said the prime rib comes pre cooked, and they warm it up.  Couldn't eat the fat, which is best part. Just to tough. 
The diablo burger had good flavor. Fries were ok, nothing stand off about it. 
Fried mushrooms were ok, just frozen out of the bag and deep fried."}
{"text":"Perfectly serviceable diner food.  The chips were good.  Burger was about what you'd expect.  If you'd rather support a local business than eat Waffle House, this one's fine.  Friendly waitstaff, prices about what you'd expect.  Will try one of the specials next time."}
{"text":"VIsitied for the first time on 2/8/14 and we were pleasantly surprised. The building looks \"Vintage\" and made me think of my grandparents but the service was great and the food was decent. Nothing overly creative or flavorful but decent. I think with some minor renovations and a chef in the kitchen with some creativity, this could be a really cool spot. Why do so many diners insist on serving frozen food with no flavor? Fresh is usually cheaper and makes a ton of diference. Salt people....it's a good thing!!"}
{"text":"This was our first time eating at tip top. We have lived down the street for about six months now, and we wish we had discovered it sooner. I had the chicken dinner and he ordered a Philly cheesesteak. Both our meals were more than generous portions.  The chicken was clearly plated very quickly because it was still so hot I had to wait a minute before I dove in. My boyfriends cheese steak was also hot--so they timed our meals to come out at the same time perfectly. Not as easy thing to do for most places. 

When we went, it was almost completely empty. Usually that makes me nervous, but it was the middle of the day on a week day so I'm sure it's busier at other times. After reading the reviews, I'll have to stop in for breakfast sometime. 

We had two waitresses checking up on us because it was so slow. They were both perfectly friendly and helpful, which we appreciated. They gave us plenty of time to look over the menu, which I appreciated because it is very extensive. It took us about 15 minutes to decide--just so many options! Kind of overwhelming, but we were both happy at the end!"}
{"text":"First time visit. I had pancakes with sausage patties, which were good. The waitress was sweet and helpful. There just wasn't anything particularly memorable that would make me want to return. I was one of the youngest patrons and I'm almost 62."}
{"text":"I had breakfast here and I thought it was pretty good. The hash browns were a little mushy but not bad. Clean restaurant and friendly workers. My only complaint is that the prices are a tad high for what you get. My boyfriend ordered an omelet that was around $9 and it was obviously not made with real eggs. We probably will not return."}
{"text":"I do not know why some of the negative reviews are showing up.

I visit here every time I am in town.  Of course, most eating establishments cannot be \"perfect\", but I have never had anything uncooked, cold, rotten, etc. etc..  

The service is EXCEPTIONAL, and for that alone, I will continue my visits.  If something is not done right, bring it to their attention....I am sure they will fix it!  My food was tasty, hot and served promptly.  My coffee cup never went below half!  I truly love the variety offered.....old fashioned salads, such as kidney bean, macaroni, etc. etc.. 

The dinner buffet for the 2014 Stow High Reunion on August 9 was delicious (no easy task to feed so many, I am sure).  I love that they have such a variety of meals!  Being creative is part of it.....not your usual Bob Evans same ole, same ole.   Prices are great too in this day and age!

I have fond memories of walking over to buy a burger and fries when I was young....a great treat, since we had no car and rarely got to go out to eat.  It was a real treat!

KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK GUYS AND GALS!"}
{"text":"Tip top is a great family restaurant. The views out the window are great, especially during the winter when you get to see their Christmas display!"}
{"text":"Maybe they were having a bad night.  The all you can eat fish was greasy and mushy, the mac & cheese was dry.  The service was great and it was a very quiet atmosphere for being crammed in like sardines.  

I will not give it another try but like I said, it could have been a bad night."}
{"text":"I'd say their breakfast gets a 5/5 and the rest of their meals are a 3.5/5. They have some decent daily specials worth checking out though. 

This place is as ma and pa as they come. A small town vibe to it. I'd say an older crowd, and it does get crowded at times. A good place to come for dinner if you want meatloaf or a country fried steak. 

The breakfasts are great and they have a pretty wide selection. I personally don't like eggs, so I recommend their cinnamon swirl French toast. It's delicious."}
{"text":"Tip Top is located in Stow, Oh on Darrow Road off the intersection of Kent Road. Upon walking up we were concerned as the entire dining room was nothing but senior citizens. Literally, I felt like I was in a nursing home. The staff greeted us and managed to find us a table (it was packed!). Our drink orders were taken and filled quickly.

The menu is typical American Dinner food. Salads, burgers, sandwiches, pasta, meatloaf, steak etc. They also curiously had a selection of stir fry that seemed out of place but looked good when a nearby table ordered it. In addition to fruit cocktail and pies/cake for dessert. They had an all you can eat fish fry going _on as well but I opted to try kielbasa with saurkrat and my wife ordered the chicken melt sandwich. The food arrived quickly and was piping hot.

I was initially disappointed with my meal as the kielbasa was halved long ways and grilled on one side (a big no no for someone that has Polish family and Hungarian/German ancestry). It was cooked fine but it tastes like Johnsonville sausage (I eat kielbasa every week and only from specialty retailers/polish butcher shops). I tried the saurkrat expecting more issues, but oh my goodness was it good. I am very critical of saurkrat and will not eat most store brands. Whatever they use is amazing and hands down best saurkrat I've ever had. 

My wife's sandwich was very good and I just say I want to try one next visit if not a burger. The fries were also sooo good. They had a coating that was interesting and were great overall. The ranch was also very tasty and I really enjoyed it.

Overall, I really liked eating at the place. Tip Top is the type of place you go to for a honest good food and you get exactly what you expect. I could see myself becoming a regular, and being on a first name basis with the staff."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! The food is amazing! The staff is so friendly and really enjoy what they do!! The minor renovations made over the past year or two have really made a difference! New stalls in the bathroom, new booths and tables and fresh paint! love this place!!! Overall highly recommend this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"It's diner food.  The dinner items aren't always consistent, but the breakfast always is.  They always have specials that are a good value."}
{"text":"So i visited my dad the other day and he insisted we order tip top..........i figured BLT's were a safe bet........nope. Wilted lettuce, lots of uncooked bacon, old stale bread and topped off with barely any mayo to make them as dry as possible. Hate is a strong word but i HATE tip top........the manager/owner needs to actually watch his kitchen staff and stop them from sending out GARBAGE. God i hope this place closes down so my dad never wants to eat their food again."}
{"text":"And it's gotten worse.

Thought I'd try to give them another chance. Bad mistake. How can a restaurant mess up hash browns? Oh, when you cater to the elderly. The palate has gone.

Ordered a \"create your own\" omelet. Description claims it's a five egg omelet. If there was more than three, I'll eat your hat .And having fewer eggs, you'd think it would have at least been cooked. Nope. The bacon and spinach I ordered as fillings were RAW.

Save yourself the bellyache."}
{"text":"I like this Diner type atmosphere. Prices are reasonable. Love that you can eat your meal inside and watch the bird feeders outside. The food is good and the atmosphere is nostalgic. It has a 1960s feel to it."}
{"text":"Tip Top service! 

The staff at Tip Top for a Sunday morning breakfast were awesome. Everyone was very friendly and attentive, always making sure my coffee was full and we weren't in need of anything. I can not say enough good things about their service. Their food was great, but I would still come back just for the service. 

Our food came out quickly and we enjoyed every last bite. I ordered the Irish Benedict and it did not disappoint. The other person with me ordered a southern skillet and it was really delicious! Both meals were more than enough for 1 person. I was not hungry again until dinner time. 

Our bill came to around $18 which is right in line with other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"A Tale of Two Meals.
It was the best of meals, it was the worst of meals.
My last visit here surprised me with the worst single piece of fish I have ever been served anywhere.
This visit, my wife and I both got breakfast.
She got the veggie omelet, and I got the Greek scramble or some such dish.
Hers was excellent per her own words and mine was the best Greek-style breakfast I  have enjoyed.
It had just the right amounts of gyro meat, feta, etc. in it, and it was served with a dressing sized portion of tzatziki sauce, which was promptly followed by another at my request. 
While the place was hoppin', service was efficient and cordial.  Prices were middle of the road."}
{"text":"This place just makes me sad every single time I visit....it's like being trapped in a nursing home cafeteria but with a much friendlier staff and better quality food. It's nothing worth going out of your way for or even to write home about but its not bad either. 
Although this is one of the few places locally that makes hash browns correctly, mine were really greasy, just way too much butter! But my husband & I did enjoy the pretty view they offer if you get to sit in one of their booths & the quietness. It was also nice to see the waitresses take the time to sit down with elder customers who were eating alone & clearly lonely - that says a lot about the staff and what big hearts they have. It was also nice to see they finally got rid of the red & silver sponge painted walls and picked a more cherry color :)"}
{"text":"Such a cute little diner! Me and my boyfriend stoped in cause we had never been there before,we were both pleasently suprised! Great food,nice waiting staff at a decent price. Will for sure be back:)"}
{"text":"You work hard for your money only to throw it away on crappy food and horrible service.  Went to Tip Top for Sunday breakfast as it was close to home.  The wife warned me about the place, but I have never been.  

First, we waited almost 15 minutes for our waitress to come and take our order.  I had the Cougar , eggs over medium with wheat toast.  The whites of the eggs were runny and the sausage was room temperature.  Our son had a southwestern omelet and commented that it had no flavor.  My wife had the Belgium waffle and thought it was excellent (her review is the only reason I gave it one star).  All of us thought the coffee was the weakest we had ever had in our life.

If you are looking for a good place in Stow for breakfast, I would recommend Isaly's, StowNut or the Cafe in Stow."}
{"text":"Everything we saw looked good . I had the cod dinner. It was very good 
 Came with Huge salad . Wife orderd quiche it was cold . But had blt . Very good . They dint charge for quiche . That was refreshing . So 5 stars"}
{"text":"We go to breakfast here a lot. The servers are really friendly and the food comes out very fast. They always make sure our coffee is filled and are very attentive. I get the half order of sausage gravy and biscuits because the portions are large with that. So good!"}
{"text":"One of our favorites for ordering breakfast any time of the day. Nice portions. Always get the cheese omelet.Place is busy which is a nice thing for a mom and pop restaurant. Quick and friendly service!"}
{"text":"Great foof, great service. Came in and found the fried chicken special - will be coming back! Since moving to the area we have been looking for a diner like this - so happy we found one!"}
