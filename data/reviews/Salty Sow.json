{"text":"Friday night, the place was packed! It was my first time having dinner here, and we tried one of the appetizer specials, the charcuterie board. It was interesting, maybe not something I would do again, as the goat cheese and chicken liver mousse seemed like an odd combo. Dinner, however, was wonderful! My guest had the pork shoulder, and I had the pork belly. The pork belly was perfectly rendered and crispy, with cheesy grits, delicious. My guest's pork shoulder was perfectly seasoned and tender, served in an abundant amount alongside chipotle spiced beans. Definitely will go back!"}
{"text":"I wasn't fond of the food or selection. I know the name of the restaurant refers to pork but I am not a big pork fan but my friend loved bacon!! I hate bacon! Lol!. I wish they had more chicken, salads, and steak selections for us non-pork eaters. The atmosphere was great for a date night though. They have a really nice bar and the service was good."}
{"text":"I just moved here and a friend recommended the Salty Sow. The staff was incredibly friendly. I had the Cracklin' Duroc Pork Belly and the Stuffed Mushroom appetizer. Both were fantastic and presented artistically. The waiter recommended the Kilt Lifter, an AZ brewed beer, which was also tasty and just what I had hoped it would be, a dark Scottish style beer. Glad I went and will certainly go again."}
{"text":"My husband and I live date nights at Salty Sow. Try the Paradise Valley Salad! It's the best!!!"}
{"text":"Was excited to go here then was disappointed. Party of four. tried the deviled eggs. really nothing there, just a plain old deviled egg with a little truffle oil.
My wife had the trout. well that's what she got, a trout. nothing fancy, just a trout on a plate.
I was looking forward to the pork belly. was disappointed when it came to the table. the plate didn't look great. little heap of grits with the belly put in the middle of it and a salad next to it. what, a salad?  what do you do, use a hot plate to keep the dinner warm and cook the salad or use a cold plate to keep the salad chilled and chill the dinner? They chose to chill the dinner. at first I thought there was a little sauce with the pork belly but I think it was errant salad dressing. salad was just ok at best. not even sure why it was there, where is the vegetable? oh its the salad?, no way.  the pork belly had a perfect crust to it. had to move it out of the gross grits. cuts very tender, first bite . . .  dust came out of my mouth it was so dry. what pork belly dry? yep very very very dry.  evidently they use rosemary on it so all you could taste was rosemary. rosemary shouldn't even be allowed in most kitchens unless you are serving rosemary. also no sauce with the pork belly. needed a sauce, just a little, something very big, with maybe a hint of maple, thickened by reduction.  
the meals were uninventive at best. seems like they have stolen all the OLD hip foods, duck fat fries, truffle oil, fried Brussel sprouts, which reminds me. Brussel sprouts are not cool in a restaurant. they stink the place up.  should have been so many good smells in this place but instead it smelled like a mix of vomit and stinky feet, or brussel sprouts.
very poor execution of foods, poor choices of combinations, not very skilled cooks, all the trendy items that are no longer trendy. sorry won't be back and cant recommend it.

another odd thing is the black mirrors mounted throughout.  I asked the waitress what they were because I couldn't tell. they looked like strange shaped flat screen TV's that were off , our waitress was great by the way, she said they are mirrors, supposed to make the place look bigger. guess the owners heard mirrors make the room look bigger someplace. well they just ran with it.  so it was killing me I had to go look, when you get over to the mirrors you have to look straight up into them to see the room, say what? so guess it looks bigger if you are looking at the ceiling and see a room reflection?  again, they heard something was cool, ran with it, and poor execution like the rest of it.  I was so hopeful for this place. The hipsters that think they know everything will love it."}
{"text":"Love the local beers on draft!  We tried a variety of stuff from the small plate menu.  I've been wanting to try the bone marrow since they opened!  It's a little chunkier than I expected, but very good.  My hubby had the pork tacos and loved them.  We also tried the eggplant fries - great with the dipping sauce provided.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Just a phenomenal custom, ever evolving and super creative menu with a homemade everything pork twist and then some.  Great patio, custom drinks, super pro n friendly staff. 
I'm a foody and explore a lot.  I truly believe that The Salty Sow is THE best foody restaurant East of Tatum. And beats a hell of a lot of places west of it. 
Now, if ONLY they did a brunch with a Killer Bloody Mary bar like The Windsor......"}
{"text":"Great GREAT food and wonderful atmosphere.  The bartender Jenna was awesome and fun to chat with.  We split the rare roast beef sandwich and some sort of a pot roast style entree.  Both were insane!

Of course we did the fries which were decadent as can be and split a caramel custard for dessert.  Everything exceeded our expectations.

We'd tried going here once before but it was too crowded.  We like to sit at the bar and you can catch them at a time when there isn't room but that's obviously the sign of a great place.

Wonderful open concept kitchen where you can see them cooking everything and the deck has heaters and a WONDERFUL fireplace.  

Love this place.  You will too."}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous dinner! The service was superb! Our waitress was knowledgeable and friendly and the food lived up to every expectation. The bourbon bread pudding was incredible. Will come back again, not a problem"}
{"text":"Really good!! Do yourself a favor and order the pork belly......or anything for that matter"}
{"text":"Amazing food,perfect service.Everything we ordered was delicious and prepared and plated perfectly.
We will definitely return on future trips to Az.And highly recommend you experience this dining pleasure."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of having dinner for the first time at the Salty Sow on Thursday. Our party of 14 had just come from an event, love the ambiance, great menu items (I had trouble deciding!), \"Kelly\", our server, was spectacular in taking care of all of us.  We had as an appetizer - Crispy Brussel Sprout Leaves...it's a must order (before this...I would have said I don't like brussel sprouts!)  I had the Crispy Chicken Thighs and my daughter had the Sunbru Beer Battered Fish & Chips - both incredible.  I would go back...no question!  Kudos to the Chef & Gen. Mgr :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I were really excited to try this place. The decor is amazing but food and service is absolutely awful.  It took over 7 minutes for our drinks, server (Jacob) wanted to chat with Co workers rather than serve our beverages. We decided to order appetizer, salad and two entrees. The app and salad came out quick but our sever forgot to put our food order in and we had to wait and additional 20 minutes for entrees that is with our app being boxed up for over 10 minutes before he acknowledged to put the order in, meaning over 30 minutes for our entrees!!!!. When we finally got our entrees we were even more displeased because our steak came out almost medium well rather than medium rare. My pork filet was gross and dry. We will never go back and never recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"While we were seated immediately, the food service took just shy of an hour. The appetizers were served promptly though, but there was no reason dinner should have taken nearly an hour. All we ordered was two salads and some lentils. We had to leave even before it was served because we had prior plans, and were nearly late. The reason our meal was late was that the kitchen forgot our order and the waitress didn't check on why it took 45 minutes to make two salads. The waitress apologized, but the manager don't even bother to talk with us.  I'm certain we will not go back. The appetizers we had weren't that great either."}
{"text":"It was an awesome atmosphere, we went because they are featured in Oct's issue of Phoenix Magazine. The happy hour prices are excellent, deviled eggs were devine. Also had the duck fat fries which were tasty though my husband was not a fan of the sauce. Both of our dishes were juicy and tasty!"}
{"text":"We just love this place. Wee got the Halibut for the first time and it was incredible. Love the beef shoulder, green chili stew and the eggs!"}
{"text":"Our favorite neighborhood restaurant! Food is always delicious! My only comment would be to change up the menu more often so we have new things to try!"}
{"text":"Regular here, so its obvious that I like the food and atmosphere.  I continue to write these reviews to encourage those that have not tried this restaurant to do so!."}
{"text":"I will dream about this epic meal. I know most people probably won't believe me when I say if I could come back tomorrow and have the same exact thing I had today, I WOULD!!! Try the charcuterie board...absolute yumm! I had the friend chicken with the sweet potato biscuit, AMAZING! I drove all the way from chandler to try this place out and it was worth the drive. Our cocktails were great and strong, they don't skimp on the liquor. For dessert the beignets...or as I like to call them been-YAYs. Excellent service and meal, we will be back! I feel like I wanna go home and cuddle up with a blanket and Barry White after that!

PS: if you are a fan of chicken liver mouse pâté this place does not disappoint."}
{"text":"Went for our anniversary. It was good but the food could've been better. The bone marrow was too salty and the entrees were lacking in something. But I would go back for second chance. Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT customer service and fantastic food!!"}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant! Great service, great food, great atmosphere! Happy hour is definitely the way to go! The deviled eggs are so creamy and so tasty! The fried chicken and biscuits were seasoned perfectly. You cannot go wrong with any of the choices on the menu everything is great! I definitely recommend everyone trying this place out, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I happened to be in Paradise Valley for the day and wanted to try something on this side of town. So happy we came to this place, the food is to die for! We started off with the Brussel sprout leaves which were great, this dish has raisins which I'm not a big fan of but complimented the brussels so well. For my main meal I had the roast beef dip, you will be so happy you got this dish! My boyfriend got the green tomato with guacamole appetizer as his main meal and it was delicious as well. Seriously some of the best guacamole we've ever had. We also ordered the the green chili pork stew, it was good as well but we could have gone without it. Overall an excellent place, will be back!"}
{"text":"Valentine's Day...made a reservation for 4;45 on Open Table.  Arrived at 4:35 to an empty restaurant and told we could only be seated at the bar.  Why?  Because there were \"400 reservations for 4:30\" even though we had a reservation as well.  I asked where everyone was given that it was 4:35 and the place was empty.  Still don't understand why we couldn't be seated.  We left.  Called the manager...she acknowledged our reservation and said she was sorry \"dear\".  Never going back."}
{"text":"The Salty Sow is located in a strip mall across from Paradise Valley Mall.  The interior is spacious, fresh and nicely done.   We had  the special which was trout with sweat potato and green beans and the pork filet minion wrapped in bacon.  These dishes had fresh ingredients and were five star hands down.  Prices were around $20 for entries.  The menu had some variety but was a comfort food focus around pork.  While not crowded the place had many customers and was noisey.  If you are looking for a good meal try the Salty Sow."}
{"text":"I sauntered in to the Salty Sow...and was hit by the \"Sewer Smell\" that others are posting about.  The building was totally renovated, and they screwed up something in the bathrooms.
Besides that, the restaurant isn't sure what it wants to be.  Limited menu.  Unhealthy choices (duck fat fries?)  I got the lamb burger for $14.  Are you going to be a gourmet restaurant or have a variety of items and prices on the menu?  
From the name, I expected pulled pork sandwiches and the like.  But none was to be found.  It really needs to figure out what it's going to be.  And fix that sewer smell!"}
{"text":"Great gastropub.  Feels lively and upscale while remaining casual.  Excellent beers and food - highly recommend an order of the deviled eggs for the table."}
{"text":"Great Sunday Brunch, you gotta check this out!
The Bloody Mary bar was #aaawsome!
Food was outstanding!"}
{"text":"Very good food and service! We got a delicious brussel sprout salad with salmon as well as the french dip. It was not our absolute favorite french dip, but it was definitely one of the better ones we have had. Their butterscotch/caramel dessert was absolutely amazing! Great service too. The decor was comfy and laid back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for happy hour today for the first time. They had many delicious options for food and drink. My favorite was by far the pork belly taco. Everything we had was fantastic, and our server twas exceptional. Chelsea was highly attentive and explained many of the dishes to us as well as the desserts. I honestly can't remember the last time I had such a great, hospitable server. We will definitely be back and we will definitely be asking for Chelsea!"}
{"text":"I've now been here a couple times and have mixed feelings so it gets an average rating.

The food tends to be SUPER salty... but I guess that should be self-explainitory and a given considering it's in the name right?

The food is ok, tasty but rich and as much as I want to have a gluttoness affair with my meal when it arrives, it always seems after a few bites my desire peters out and I'm left feeling heavy and like I actually need the assistance of a sow to get to my car.

The duck fries are pretty good and a nice surprise. Unfortunately, sometimes the service has the same personailty & helpfulness as a frozen uncooked french fry before it gets pizzazed up with the seasonings & fat.

If I'm with someone who really wants to eat here I'll go, but it's not something on the top of my list or a favorite."}
{"text":"The food and drinks here are incredible! They always have a specials board and I have not found a single thing that I haven't liked from it. Also, no one can beat \"all day happy hour\" on Monday and Tuesdays. That have good drink prices and excellent prices on some delicious inexpensive food for HH too (bacon deviled eggs, crispy Brussel sprout leaves, honey friend chicken).... yum!"}
{"text":"Rating would have been higher if it wasn't for the GM/Manager.

Food was great (asiago crusted halibut was some of the best fish I've ever had).  Service was great, bartender and hostesses went out of their way to ensure customers were satisfied.  To my extreme disappointment, the treatment by Kevin (not sure if he was the Manager or GM), was not consistent with the the rest of the experience.

Before being seated at a table, I spoke to the hostess and bartenders who advised the Oregon/UofA Pac 12 Championship would be televised in their bar area.  I arrived first in my party and had the option to sit my entire party directly at the bar, or in a table with views of the tvs.  I was told not to worry, they would be more than happy to slightly shift one the tvs for an even better view from one of the available tables.

Once the game commenced, the bartender did in fact shift 1 of the 2 tvs SLIGHTLY in our direction.  Which Kevin promptly moved back and from what I can tell, reprimanded his staff.  COMPLETELY unacceptable.  Nice customer service and nice treatment of your employees who were attempting to satisfy customers.  He had a very fake and ingenuine conversation with us trying to explain, which was laughable.  I do not see the harm in a tv being moved SLIGHTLY due to a customer request and in fact the fakeness and snottiness he displayed was far worse than the act of moving the tv back.  What purpose does a tv on an adjustable stand serve if you are not going to allow it to be shifted?  Of course by this time the bar was full and there was no option for us to move to a closer view of the tvs.

In this day and age, I'm far more impressed by good customer service than I am with good food.  Customer service is the reason why I repeat visits to deserving restaurants.  I mean sure, food has to be decent, but there is no excuse for outright bad customer service and by the highest \"ranking\" employee in the restaurant.  No thank you.  

This was my 2nd visit to the Salty Sow and Kevin was not present for my first experience, which was much better.  The bartenders, wait staff and hostesses were so great, that I may give the restaurant another chance, but it won't be soon and I sincerely hope that Kevin won't be there the next time to sour my experience."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service, nice interior design & patio.  But best of all, they figured out the perfect volume for their music! You can actually talk to the person across from you!"}
{"text":"love this place so far. I've been here for my birthday and ordered the bone marrow to start. No other places offer that kind of food, so you better try it. I had the pork shoulder and it was delish. The dessert was awesome...it was like a banana fritters with vanilla ice cream...yummmy!!  I also like the ambience. Everything looks brand new. Service was great. I want to go back here for happy hour or when they have a 4-course dinner menu offer or something. You'll save money that way and get to try more of what they have to offer."}
{"text":"Great meal, atmosphere and staff. Was made to feel welcome and comfortable. Attention to guests seems genuine and not canned. Very memorable experience."}
{"text":"Love he atmosphere and the food is great. You have to try the pork tacos!   Nice happy hour great patio."}
{"text":"This place is great! Thankfully the guy I've been talking to selected this fine establishment. He owes me because he messed up last weekend... Long story... But anyway the food is amazing and they have live music on Fridays!"}
{"text":"Fantastic cocktails - Petey and their Old Fashioned were both fantastic. Lamburger, slow cooked beef shoulder, and bacon wrapped pork filet mignion were all delicious. Can't go wrong. Oh yeah, duck fat fries...mmmmm, and Brussels sprout leaves. Everything is delicious."}
{"text":"First time at the salty sow and loved everything about the place. Beautifully designed with a creative and adventurous menu. Our server Drew made our experience ever so memorable. He was incredibly knowledgable and passionate about the menu. His recommendations were impeccable, could not have been happier.

The truffled deviled eggs and ahi carpaccio to start were divine. The scallop special with polenta was phenomenal!! The gin cocktail with lavender was superb as well, not to mention the dark chocolate truffle cake... In heaven. Drew made our experience so wonderful, will certainly be back again. First ever yelp and well deserved!!"}
{"text":"Scouting Happy Hour's in the neighborhood with the wifey and finally made it to the Salty Sow after getting great reviews from our friends! Can't go wrong with this place any night of the week for happy hour! Great food and drinks reasonably priced and plenty of seating. Just missed getting the patio, so get in here around 4:30 on Fridays to get the prime spots. Great service from Chelsea and definitely coming back with our friends!"}
{"text":"Been meaning to try this new restaurant out, glad we finally did. Nice atmosphere, (although a little noisy, we sat at the bar during happy hour.) very friendly and upbeat bartenders and waitstaff. Food was very good, we started out with the mussels which was a special that night. delish....coming from a displaced Jersey girl that means alot, He had the french dip and I had the fish special, nice manageable serving with fresh cabbage slaw ingredients. Happy to find a local hangout in the Paradise Mall area that isn't a chain and adds ambience to our Grey Goose, straight up, extra dry Martinis."}
{"text":"One of the worse restaurant experiences we have had.  Our server spilled water all over the table, brought us water a second time and was confused how we got the first sets, after 45 minutes and giving our drink orders once and our dinner orders twice we still had not seen either.  Requested a new server as we were very unsure of our servers abilities to bring us anything and we needed to leave for the airport.  New server did say he was surprised by our server as he is one of their best.  We were surprised the manger had not come to speak to us and mentioned this.  He did come over but just to ensure our current server was better.  They did knock 20% off the bill but we were shocked with how bad this experience was.  The food was okay at best.  Being a part of of an excellent group with Eddie V's and Roaring Fork we were surprised by this experience.  In fact we looked for hidden cameras wondering if we were being plunked."}
{"text":"We go most Friday nights. Hostess are on point. Seat you immediately and super nice. Food has been good each time we have been there."}
{"text":"We had a horrible experience. First I ordered a chicken sandwich to go for my husband. I have photos of this sandwich it was RAW. Raw chicken! I call Salty Sow and the manager kept going on how it was only 15.00 sandwich but he would put it back on my card. Well...this NEVER happined. I went back and was told that that manager was no longer employed with Salty Sow. And the manager I spoke to that day assured me she would put it back on my card. Not seeing it on the 3rd day and wanting to give them yet another opportunity to make it up to us we stopped by for a late dinner. Well the same manager was there. She assured us she put it through for 20.00$$!! It was a 100.00 check and that hardly covered the tax. She never sent a drink over a dessert. Nothing. And I'm sitting in her booth with a picture on my phone with RAW Chicken!! I have never negativly reviewed anyone but raw chicken people deserve to know about!!"}
{"text":"I hate giving bad reviews but It is what it is. We were here yesterday for Mother's Day and we got the duck fries, Rosemary chicken from the happy hour menu for our kids, porchetta for me and the beef shoulder for my husband and some sort of chocolate truffle cake to share.

Duck fries - needed some acid! The sauce that came with it didn't help with cutting the richness of the fries and egg.

Rosemary chicken - overall it was ok, but to me it needed more flavor. It needed some sort of acid and some herb or something to cut the greasiness.


Beef shoulder - it was served a bit cold for our liking. Flavor is ok.

Porchetta - if you know me, you know I enjoy fatty food. But holy cow, I can't even eat this. Where do I begin. The pork was tender BUT needed more flavor and a bunch of acid just to cut down the fattiness. The salad that was served with it was NOT sufficient to do the job. The green pesto that was on the porchetta didn't do anything, no flavor. The pork itself did not have any flavor. I bit into the bread that came with it and it was soaking in fat. I tell you, if it was flavorful fat like bacon or something seasoned I would have eaten it BUT it's not. 

Chocolate truffle cake - this is the only thing I gave this place 1 star. 

I am so disappointed since I was the one who picked this place for Mother's Day, but never again."}
{"text":"We came for restaurant week. First off, the decor was great. Love the bar and the open kitchen. It was a Saturday, so there was live music playing outside, but we could hear the performance from inside. I had the pork belly dish, while my wife enjoyed the beef shoulder. Both dishes were excellent. We both had a couple well-made cocktails. Their Moscow mules were refreshing. If you're an Old Fashioned fan like myself, try their Salty Sow'r."}
{"text":"Only here for HH, but it's great. Brussel sprouts appetizer is sublime.  Tacos are solid and an unexpectedly good fried chicken and sweet potato biscuit. A great choice for a slightly upscale dinner. Probably a touch better than Roaring Fork at this point, and for the location, its probably the best option."}
{"text":"Like Crystal says \"Just go to happy hour\"
Thats because the $ per ounce of food here is astronomical.

Beef shoulder is tasty($16), pretty small though. They serve it in a cooking pan with the veggies and taters, which are also 'lil nibbles.

Got the deviled eggs, good stuff. So good that I ordered another round after I mowed down the entree like it was an appetizer.($6+$6=$12)

My lady got the petite bone-in filets, which were tasty.($14? I think) She was going to get the pork shoulder but it had white beans in the sauce and they wont leave them out. Kinda weird, but whatevs.

Might go back for happy hour...."}
{"text":"best place for appitizers!!! pricey food but really good"}
{"text":"I've been to Salty Sow on at least four occasions & my experience with them, has been pretty consistent. Pork belly was good. The slow cooked beef shoulder was delicious. The PV Salad was good at one sitting but not so good the last time I visited. It didn't seem to have much taste & the chef was very stingy with the items listed for the dish. A salad at that price should be outstanding. The decor & atmosphere is very nice."}
{"text":"food rocks, wine is what I like to drink, and having live music makes me cone back!

Nice!"}
{"text":"Amazing! The food choice are great, our meal was terrific, sides & desert were terrific. I was floored by how the delicious and creative food."}
{"text":"This place has a very pleasant environment. Lots of TV's.  Patio area is very well connected to the inside of the restaurant. Service is good but the best of all is the food.  Every dish I order is good and for appetizer the fried caramelized brusselsprouts are the best."}
{"text":"I am severly disappointed in the class and dishonesty of the staff. I regrettably forgot to grab my sunglasses off of my table after having a great dining experience with a dear friend. There is no where they could have gone but in an employee's possession. For this reason I will never recommend or repeat a visit to this establishment."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre at best. It had little flavor and pretty much everyone at the tables food showed up either cold or luke warm. Server was friendly enough but very very slow. The entire dining experience took just under two hours with no desert. This place seem like another one of those cool themed restaurants with no substance. Will not be going back again. I really wish restaurants in this day and age could focus on good food instead of decor."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was good. We shared the pork taco, lavender fried chicken, duck fat fries and potbelly with grits. I was very excited to try this restaurant! 

However...The reason why I rated a 3 is because I got sick 2 hours after, and my husband soon followed. It wasn't just a stomach upset but there was legit vomiting and the other unpleasant thing...

Don't think we'll be back"}
{"text":"Salty Sow definitely stands out amongst the Red Lobster/Olive Garden/Outback variety in the PV mall area. The cuisine is a great blend of comfort food, upscale items, and fresh/local ingredients. We have been coming here a few times a month since it opened and have yet to be disappointed!

They have a great $5 happy hour everyday from 4-6:30 pm with items like fried honey rosemary chicken with a sweet potato biscuit, crispy brussel sprout hash, green chili pork stew, and duck fat fries...yes!

They have a unique selection of cocktails and have $2 off HH specials on those too. 

A favorite salad of mine is the PV salad with kale, grilled chicken, dates, avocado, bleu cheese, bacon and candied almonds.

Salty Sow has a great vibe with brick walls, unique lighting and a large rectangular bar. They have live music certain nights on their outdoor patio that we are still able to enjoy when it's 100 degrees outside :)

If you go on a weekend night, I suggest you get a reservation! Even the bar is packed most nights and the high tables around the bar are often reserved. 

This place is a great gem in the PV mall neighborhood and I hope it stays that way!"}
{"text":"That meal and evening could not have been more perfect!!!  We had bone marrow with herbs arugula to spread on toasted bread that I will have again for sure since it's hard to find; the milk braised pork shoulder with white beans and escarole that was SO flavorable and the pork could not have been more tender; pickled red and golden beets with goat cheese and pistachios that I will now do at home because adding the goat cheese and pistachios will make them so much more inviting to a lot of people who won't try beets; crisped brussel sprout leaves that are so unique..... and a salted caramel with sweet crème fraiche.... the Williamette Pinot Noir was a good price too... 

This place could not get any better!!!!!  Loved out seating; Beth the manager who checked with us many times; Brenda our waitress who was excellent and another manager spoke to us as we left.

This is going to be a place we go back to many times!"}
{"text":"Is there new management???

Let me preface by saying this used to be one of our favorite spots and we would frequent for happy hour.  Staff was friendly and helpful, food was great, loved the live music.  Fast forward to today when no seating was available outside so we asked to be moved when a table became available ... the request was ignored the entire time as I watched multiple tables outside be vacated and filled.  The service was bad.  I have never had to wait so long for food or drink there.  Our second drink came after we were done eating, I considered returning it since I ordered it 25 minutes before and food was prepared before a drink was.  Waited another 15 minutes for our check.  No live music outside, staff was not accommodating, and hostesses ignored our request.  All I can think of for this drastic change is new, worse management.  Therefore, we will not be back.  Major disappointment to see one of our favorite spots go downhill."}
{"text":"First off we lucked out, we walked in and got informed it was happy hour all night and BOGO entrées. We had \"the restaurant week\" 3 course rib eye dinner and halibut.  I took pictures of them both, the lemon butter sauce was better than my lemon caper beurre blanc sauce I make at home (which is saying something) we literally cleaned our plates completely it was that fantastic. The server was also awesome. Long hair with a braid. She rocks!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for a light dinner  and was not disappointed!  The roasted beet salad and the shaved Brussels sprout salad were amazing!  Also shared the truffled deviled eggs and the duck fat fries.   Get the eggs -  they are delicious but the fries were nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"I got to check this cool restaurant a few weeks ago.  The staff could not have been nicer or more professional.  The sustainable menu is very nicely done and is geared towards comfort foods with varying combinations of textures and flavors not usually found around here.  To be honest I do not usually go for this type of menu and can be pretty picky.  That being said, I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed everything I tasted.  I did not try the Roasted Bone Marrow dish that someone ordered.  I could not help thinking that my dogs would have loved the Bone Marrow.  I also bypassed the \"Things in a Jar\" section.  I'm just not \"there\" yet and will refrain from further comments.
We sampled many of the popular items that other Yelpers had mentioned, i.e. the Duck Fat Fries, the Muscles, the roasted beets and of course, the lamb burger. They were all deliscious.  The star of the show was the crispy brussel sprout leaves. Savory charred edges with a light delicate crunch.  YUMMY!
I had one of the special entrees which may have been created for the Restaurant week.  It was an amzing halibut topped with asiago.  There would be no left overs this night.  We finished up with the Bananas Foster Beignets which were light and toasty with decadently tasting vanilla ice cream and honey.  
I would highly recommend this unique and comfortable experience for anyone looking for something a little different and definitely rewarding!"}
{"text":"Decent tacos, eggs come with everything. Happy hour is great, lots of great cocktails, decent beer list, good wine list. Hoping to try actual dinner sometime here."}
{"text":"I went here on Tuesday night with my husband and a friend. 

The happy hour was pretty good - 4 stars: $2 off draft beers and cocktails and a variety of food items in the $5-7 range. I wasn't a huge fan of the egg on top of the fries (it got cold pretty quickly), and I prefer ketchup on my fries, not mayo - duck fat or not. However, I really did like the truffled deviled eggs. The chicken ($7), which you can't get any other time BUT happy hour, was OK. Apparently they used to have a large biscuit, but it's now about the size of a quarter - a delicious quarter, but a quarter nonetheless. Biscuits are cheap, don't be cheap with your biscuit portion, Salty. 

Entrees and service - 2 stars: It took a full hour (an HOUR) to get our dinner after we ordered - again, this was Tuesday night at 6:30. The waitress took our order by memory, but messed up my husband's selection. He asked her specifically whether she thought the pork or beef was better and she said, \"pork for sure!\" So he ordered the pork, and got the beef instead. The beef was also, basically, a child-sized portion for $20. 
I ordered the ABLT salad and the bacon almost ruined it... too smoky and chewy - the salad has enough going on with the ranch, bleu cheese, avocado and tomatoes - just use regular bacon! Also, put it in a damn bowl! After waiting the hour for the salad, I had to wait another 5 minutes for something I could actually eat out of... the long, thin, rectangular plate with no lip was (huge surprise) wholly inadequate to eat what is basically a wedge salad off of. 
Our friend got the cheeseburger and really liked it. We had to ask for our check after spending nearly two hours in the restaurant. The waitress never did apologize for the ridiculous wait for our food. Even at a busy time during a busy day, waiting more than 30 minutes after ordering for an entree is unreasonable.

I might come back for happy hour again, and maybe try the cheeseburger, but I won't be in a rush to get back here."}
{"text":"I would give them 5 stars, but I think their dishes are really tiny, and they need more vegetarian options.  Other than that, I LOVED this place!  They had good beer on tap, our waitress was GREAT, and the food we ordered was really yummy.  I was really disappointed they were out of the cauliflower casserole, as that's why I went in, to try it.  And the one salad I ordered, I wasn't a big fan of, so the waitress felt so bad, she sent the manager over who gave me a $10 gift card so I'd come back.  I didn't even complain!!!!  That was really good customer service!!!  I will definitely be going back!!!"}
{"text":"This is my second time giving this place a chance. But both times, especially this last time has been subpar in both management and food. 

The decor was good (except for the lighting). But with the constant overcrowding around the table, by staff, and the horribly mixed classic 70s rock (which did not go with the atmosphere) it felt short of anything you'd expect to be decent.

The food overall was not what you'd want it to be. It's a farmhouse restaurant that just seems like it's trying to upstage itself.

The duck fries are NOT that great, and not worth the price. I had a fish platter and it was overly seasoned, had a ton of unnecessary asiago cheese on it and the veggies were overcooked. 

Everything else just fell flat.

Don't let the reviews hype this place. Honestly, it's not worth the money nor the time."}
{"text":"This place has a great happy hour. I would start there first. Delicious food and drinks. Its  a little hipster-ish, but the quality of food makes me not give a crap.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"B&E...OMG!
I've been here multiple times and the food has never disappointed. Drinks are good, food is fresh and delicious. Bacon & eggs entree, deviled eggs appetizer and that 110 minute egg over fries are just a few of my favorite things to order here."}
{"text":"We went for Easter Brunch and could not have been more pleased!  We had reservations and were seated promptly.  The food was fabulous and the selections extensive.  There was something for everyone!  We'll be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Really good food and drinks. Happy hour is good, too. Love the crisp chicken thighs and Blanche drink. Duck fat fries are really good, too."}
{"text":"We came here for beef.  The night we went, prime rib was on the menu in addition to the steaks.  We live close by so we chose this place over a chain restaurant hoping for better quality and service.  We were wrong.  Our waiter took entirely too long to get our order and by the time he came by, all beef was gone.  To this he told us, \"Sow means pig.\"  I refrained from saying anything in reply for fear of spurting back obscenities.  Maybe he was new, but beef is CLEARLY written on the menu.  Never going back but my husband and I now have an inside joke out of it. Two stars are there because the ambiance is nice.  Zero stars for service."}
{"text":"Great food, but the servers waited an extra ten minutes to seat us, they had ten open tables, so we didn't get the happy hour prices. Lame!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing! But.....we had to wait approximately 30 minutes to order our entree. We sat down, and our server promptly took our drink order.  He came back and we ordered duck fries.  He then came back another time and explained the specials, but then walked away without taking our order. Our Duck Fat Fries came out about ten minutes later, and they were good. They could have been a little hotter, but the flavor was right. After nearly finishing our fries, and waiting 20 minutes for the waiter to come back, we finally ordered our entree's. I had the Asiago Halibut, and my man had the Beef Shoulder. Both were amazing! The drinks were strong, and the ambiance was welcoming.
We will definitely come back, I just hope that we have more attentive service next time."}
{"text":"Given the location of this place it offers a nice variety of food choices.  It's a mix between business and casual and pretty fancy so it's a nice atmosphere. I'll give it another chance before I decide if I'll go there frequently or on special occasions."}
{"text":"Best place I've been to in several years. Didn't even realize it was Restaurant Week, but did one of their three course specials, had the beet salad, cod and butterscotch dessert. Everything was amazing, had the eggplant and deviled eggs for apps, also very good. Service was fantastic and a nice looking place with live music that wasn't too loud. My friends all enjoyed it as well. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Great service - always good drinks . My fav appy is the fried green tomatoes! Always to die for good - however I wish the menu would change a little more for the season. I suggest a reservation- it can be busy around the dinner rush . Great place for dinner with with friend But the music can be a bit to loud and you almost have to yell across the table ."}
{"text":"Since it recently opened in my neighborhood, I thought I should check it out, even though I wasn't intrigued by the menu online.  Wow, I'm glad I came.  My wife and I shared a turkey sandwich and brussel sprout salad for lunch.  The food was incredibly flavorful.  The service was good too.  The waiter made beer suggestions that were spot-on for the time of day and temperature.  Impressive.  I will definitely be coming here often."}
{"text":"It was our first time there. The service was great at first and then it got worse as the night went on. Our drinks and appetizer came out pretty quickly but we had to wait at least 45 mins for our entrees to be served. We should had said something when the people at the table next to us sat down and got their food before we did. When our food finally arrived it was lukewarm. We ate a few bites and took it home to heat it up. We told the server about it and she didnt say much about it and just said she was sorry.  The sad part about it ! It was our 33rd Anniversary.  The food was tasty but cold. I might give it another try, maybe happy hour would be good. Very Disappointed!"}
{"text":"We'd heard about this cool new place.  Went back for happy hour, but the trendy menu with off-putting descriptions like 'duck fat' just didn't make it with us.  Although the elderberry liquer sangria is fabulous!"}
{"text":"I've never once been to Salty Sow and left disappointed. Though I try to order something different each time, if all I ate for the rest of my life were the Brussels sprouts, I would be incredibly happy. The service and the atmosphere are pretty excellent as well, it's a unique restaurant once you get inside. The patio is delightful, too. Brussels sprouts aren't the only thing that have going for them, the actual entree menu (and dessert menu) have so many options, and the thing is, they're all pretty excellent. And not to pretend for a minute that we were just coming for the food, the drink menu is creative and inspired."}
{"text":"Well done, Salty Sow, well done. I would give you six stars if I could. 

You got everything right... Great layout, awesome bartenders, spotless interior, great beer selection, killer meats, and it smells like pig heaven. Not the heaven dead pigs go to but the heaven I would go to and eat pig meat for eternity. 

Duck fat fries, pork belly taco, double cheeseburger with bacon... bacon conjured by magical pig wizards I might add. Sheer swine sorcery. 

Now please open one up north!"}
{"text":"Been here over 3 times.  Stellar experience every time.  The Pork Belly, to no surprise, is the best I've ever had, and I will be chasing that recipe forever.  The Duck Fat Fries with Sous Vide Egg on top is truly a fantastic experience.  I go here whenever I can."}
{"text":"Excellent food, service and ambience! Had a fabulous dinner! We did not care for the dog friendly patio for dinner, inappropriate really. We choose to leave our dogs at home so not to bother others, not everyone likes pets with their dining, could be a deal breaker!"}
{"text":"What. Wonderful find!  Our uber driver recommended it- Dennis.  There is a fabulous happy hour. My mom had a maple glazed old fashion with a large ice cube   I had the frozen margarita. - little Larry. We ordered the award winning deviled eggs and the truffle duck fries-  they were excellent.  There was a pork chop special that was perfectly cooked.  Mom had a pv salad and some cheesy grits.  Tanner our waiter was incredibly helpful. All of his suggestions were spot on.   I highly recommend this establishment. I didn't see an unhappy face in the crowd. Recommend reservations."}
{"text":"UNBELIEVABLY AMAZING!  Not only the food but the excellent waiter, Shawn. My son and I went there for the first time tonight and can't wait to go back. We asked Shawn to suggest our food and we went with it, the best meal we have had in a long time.  The appetizer, eggplant fries, terrific! My entree, Bacon & Eggs, I have to admit I was nervous to go with it, but was pleasantly shocked. The other meal was Beef Shoulder, so good and such great flavor. And last but not least the dessert, that was probably THE BEST dessert ever, Banana Fosters. Thank you again Shawn, we will see you soon and I will definitely get the Bacon & Eggs again!"}
{"text":"Was visiting Arizona for a weekend. Food was good. Service was great. Blood orange margarita was yummy. Looked like they were setting up for some live music as we were leaving."}
{"text":"Wonderful charcuterie platter. Two types of buttery pate, perfectly crispy/chewy toast, awesome Andouille sausage (two pieces was not enough!), outstanding goat cheese.  The farmhouse salad was also excellent.  And my first try of a 110-degree egg.  Interesting. Cheesy grits were good, but some chipotle or chile would make the much better.  Such a pleasant atmosphere and patio.  And our server was very friendly, talkative, not rushed, and had great suggestions and opinions about the food.  My only wish is, some place would do a choose-your-own charcuterie board: maybe a board with 5 constants and then, like pizza toppings, you pick 5 more from a list. On this list I would include some more pickled things, maybe even some Korean-pickled things like kimchi, and some spicy things."}
{"text":"I want to like this place! Been 4 times in about 2 years, because it's close to home. Each time we just didn't enjoy. Kept giving it another try, like I said, wanted to like it. 
The menu is limited, none of the items jump out as \"WOW, I want to order that!\"
The menu items look interesting enough, but the flavors are lacking. Service isn't consistent, had extremely bad on one occasion and great another.
Atmosphere is nice."}
{"text":"Wow!! First ever brunch and it is delicious hurry come down. Goes until 2pm. Check out the photos posted below."}
{"text":"This is my first official review and let me say I'm glad I was saving it for the Salty Sow.  The whole experience including food and service was excellent. The GF and I started off with the Farm Salad and then the  Charcuterie Plate of meaty goodness. For our main meal, the GF got the Bone in Filet which had an amazing sauce and was cooked to perfection. I had the 10ounce Lamb Burger which was excellent as well.   To top it all off the service was excellent. Our server was very helpful in explaining menu items and giving us suggestions. Thanks, Michael, for the great service! Next time, we will save room for the bananas foster dessert"}
{"text":"Stand by for the stomach ache of your life the next day! My wife and I shared a meal and both of us are really sick the next day. I'm never going back!"}
{"text":"I was in town for two nights and stumbled across the Salty Sow (thanks to Yelp). Great name and great food.

This place has amazing food for the price and a great atmosphere. The first night I ordered a beef shoulder (on the recommendation of the bartender) and was floored. Not what I was expecting but amazingly tasty and filing. Then for desert the bartender recommend a fried banana. All in all, it was one of the best meals I have had in a long time.

As I write this I am the parking lot having come back for my second night in town. Tonight I had the Pork Filet. It was just as good as the meal last night.

If you want a great tasting meal, good price, and inviting atmosphere. I recommend the Salty Sow."}
{"text":"Love love LOVE this place! My husband and I were in Arizona for Barrett Jackson in January and saw this place while driving to our rental house. 

Being foodies from Atlanta, we're very serious about good food (can't stand chains). We couldn't wait to give this place a shot and it did not disappoint! We ate nothing, but apps since we saw many awesome items there! We also tried tons of fun cocktails with a wide variety for all palates. We finished up with the richest caramel pudding which was AMAZING! Wish we had more time to go back and try even more of the menu. 

Wish we had this place back in Atlanta. We'd be regulars for sure!"}
{"text":"I was not thrilled about going to a meat-centric restaurant, but I accompanied my boyfriend and was pleasantly surprised. Our appetizer was the eggplant frites... I've had bitter eggplant before but this was very lightly breaded and dusted with parmesan.  Light and delicious! He had the French Dip which he said was the best he ever had and he's a food snob. I saw something on a yelp review about a veggie platter, and I ordered it.... it is called the chef's vegetable antipasto. I got a cutting board filled with a tiny frisè salad, roasted tomatoes, carrots, and fingerling potatoes, broccolini and a delicious salad of fresh tomato, watermelon & balsamic. Everything was  perfectly seasoned and so flavorful. Our waitress, Jacki, was amazing.  Knowledgeable, sweet, and even though she had a bunch of tables our wine and water glasses never ran empty. I gave 4 stars because I wish there were more veggie options, but I'll be back!"}
{"text":"My husband, son, and I went to this restaurant, sat at our table reviewing the menu. We found that the menu didn't match up to their website. We were unable to find anything that we were even remotely interested in ordering. So we left. The staff was very nice and understanding about it. They do have a very nice staff, that's for sure! I guess this restaurant just wasn't for us...2 stars for the staff!!"}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about the Salty Sow!  My husband and I have been going there twice a month for a while now and we both love it.  The restaurant itself is great looking, the staff has always been gracious and helpful, and the food is fabulous.  The Brussel Sprout Caesar is the bomb!  But everything we have had has been delicious.  We will continue to go as often as possible!"}
{"text":"Been here twice and plan to go back for a third time next week! It's accommodating for all sizes of groups. Happy hour drink deals are good, and they have a great selection and fun cocktails. The copper mule is delicious! The happy hour food is very filling for small plates. 

The pork chile was amazing and super spicy. The duck fat fries are to die for, and pork tacos are delicious, too. But one of my favorites has been the fried green tomatoes with guacamole. Yum! Service is good as well. Super friendly and have never had to wait too long for a table, food or a refill. 

The patio is really cozy and enjoyable. The landscaping is done so well that you'd never guess that the place is nestled in a Wal Mart parking lot next to the oh so classy Tilted Kilt. And the live acoustic music on the weekend is a nice touch. One of my new favorites, for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is out standing. The environment suits the food just right. New age feel with just enough class. Service was perfect and food was cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"I walked in the door and the hostess just turned away as if we didn't exist.  We walked to the bar sat down and waited for 5 minutes for the bartender to wait on us.  After taking our drink order, we watched him for another 5 minutes clean up glasses and wipe down the bar.  We finally said forget it and walked out!!!  I would fire the bartender and the hostess as they are not creating a happy and prosperous atmosphere.  I tell people not to waste their time going there!!"}
{"text":"The food is awesome, the drinks are great!
The reason I gave them 4 stars is because in their drinks they put one BIG ice cube. That takes up a lot of the drink space AKA beverage real-estate. 
But the vibe is awesome for happy hours."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here countless times, mostly because of their awesome happy hour menu that runs all day on Mondays and Tuesdays. Their honey fried chicken is out of this world. Try their brussel sprouts, and their Gruyere and roast beef sandwich!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Salty Sow in Austin (see my previous reviews!), and was extremely excited to try out the Scottsdale location for a bachelorette party I've been planning for my sister. Per their website, I have called their manager Lynda multiple times, to no reply. I have e-mailed the restaurant, to no reply. I have called the main restaurant and been told Lynda will call me back, which she never does. My co-planner went through the same calls, to no reply. It was only when a white friend called inquiring about setting up a dinner that someone even returned their call from Salty Sow. Is it racism? Probably not. But it sure doesn't sit well with me one bit."}
{"text":"We made a reservation for 14 people. The hostess promised me an inside table, as our party did not want outside. When we arrived, we were seated on the patio. She told us \"The owners wife decided to come in, and wanted your table.\" Ok, well..... Customers come first in the service industry! And who runs out of chips & salsa when you share a parking lot with Walmart? Get over yourself Salty Sow!"}
{"text":"Traveling in Pheonix and glad we found this place.   Great atmosphere, fabulous food, wonderful service.  Home cooking type food with a twist.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Spent New Years Eve with my wife over the Surf & Turf Special. Unfortunately they were out of the Rib Eyes, they graciously substituted a Filet and a huge slice of Prime Rib with no additional charges. Food was great as was the service. We really enjoy this great neighborhood find!"}
{"text":"Innovative thoughtful menu, friendly service and good beer. What else can you hope for?"}
{"text":"I just love this place. I've had great or at least good service every time I've been here. The food it always good, and the cocktails are always strong. They have a great happy hour which includes some of my favorites: fried green tomatoes, duck fat fries, tacos, and fried chicken. Plus great prices on cocktails and beer! I have had the fish and chicken entrees here before and they were both really good. The bananas foster dessert is amazing as well. One of my favorite go-to places for happy hour in Phoenix! Especially if you want to leave completely full for like $10 per person."}
{"text":"Wanted to love this place but food was subpar and service was awful. Server forgot to put our drink order in so we didn't get our cocktails till we were done with appetizers. Deviled eggs were good but very rich. We also had the green Verde stew, which the server-side was not spicy but actually was quite spicy.  We had the pork belly which was delicious but was served on ice cold grits. We also had the special sandwich of turkey, way too much turkey and was nothing special. It was served with \"duck fries\" although they just seemed like overcooked regular fries. For dessert we had the special, maple bread pudding. Yuck. We ate 2 bites and that was enough. Burnt on the bottom, dry throughout. Not good. Definitely won't return!"}
{"text":"FANTASTIC - all the way around ... superb ambiance, stellar food and terrific service!
Our server Tony was delightful - he made the experience remarkably enjoyable.
We picked the Salty Cow based in the reviews and they were spot on.
Everything about this place is RIGHT!.
If you are tired of all of your usual spots and your attempts at finding a \"new place\" just have not worked out - look no further ... the Salty Cow is the place!

We will be back."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night and expected to wait, which I have no issue with, except there's no seating outside for waiting.
When we did get seated it took forever for our server to arrive and then a long wait for our drinks. Food was excellent, the duck fat fries were delicious! I had the slow roasted pork which I really enjoyed but the service really detracted from the overall experience."}
{"text":"My favorite dinner spot in the area! Everything is delicious and the menu is well thought out. You can tell everything they make is made with great ingredients and from scratch. No skimping here. The service and drinks are always great as well."}
{"text":"Finally some great gastropub fare in the North Phoenix area.  Came here for Mother's Day initially dissapointed they changed their brunch buffet to a limited ala carte style menu.  But left totally satisfied wanting more. 

My wife hates brussel sprouts and really enjoyed their salad. Deviled Eggs are as good as people say.  But the star of our trip was the Roast Turkey Sandwhich with avocado and a fried egg.  It's easy to see the quality and care of the turkey roasted on site.   

Can't wait to check out their happy hour!"}
{"text":"The halibut and the Brussels Sprout Caesar salad was awesome! Great wine list! Decor is fabulous! We will be back!"}
{"text":"great take on bbq comfort food. a gourmet twist at every corner with a great, relaxed decor and well versed staff."}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood and decided to finally give this a try.  The menu isn't that much different from when my mom was growing up in the midwest on the farm, so the selection was familiar with her.  The building is beautifully done.  Very pleasant inside and comfortable ambience. The open concept kitchen is something we both like and enjoy watching.  

Service wasn't too quick considering the number of employees on the floor.  We were in an hour before dinner rush with few patrons seated.  There seemed to be a mix up with servers, I am assuming because the server assigned to our table was running late and they didn't know if he was showing.  When he got on the floor, he seemed nervous but very nice and informative.  I ordered a salad which cost $13 and my dinner partner had the roast beef sandwich which was $14.  Food was good but nothing spectacular and terribly overpriced, esp for the size portion.  We opted for a dessert of the strawberry cornmeal shortcake.  Again, for $6.50 greatly overpriced for strawberries, whipped cream, and a piece of cornmeal bread.
 
The one thing that really put us off was the server constantly having to move his hair out of his eye and he kept wiping his mouth, I think because of how much he was sweating.  Touching your hair and face w/out washing your hands is a big no-no in the food industry.  He proceeds to brings us silverware and keeps our drinks full with disgusting hands.  We also watched one of the female servers as she kept getting the hair out of her eyes.  A revisit to food handlers policies is warranted.  Truly unappetising - we didn't want to touch much.  Both of us washed our hands as soon as we got home.

We were quite un-impressed with the entire experience.  Something I guess comes with the territory when there is 30 + years of food industry experience between my dinner partner and I.  We pay attention to detail and the little things.

I give 3 stars only because our main meal had a good taste.  We both agreed the over-priced menu and the unsanitary practices of the servers deemed it not worth returning."}
{"text":"First time here tonight and we were not disappointed in the first two items we ordered and shared, both appetizer items and both absolutely delicious! I highly recommend the deviled eggs which are better than any I have had anywhere ever! We also had the pork Verde stew with homemade warm soft tortillas, again absolutely delicious! Then we took the advice of one of the other yelp reviewers and ordered the Rosemary fried chicken which comes in a small serving of two small boneless breast pieces with a tasty homemade biscuit and gravy. Unfortunately, the fried chicken was presented beautifully but lacked flavor. I would not recommend it or order it again but we would definitely come back for the deviled eggs and pork Verde which were both absolutely fantastic! Great service and very very nice atmosphere! Modern clean beautiful decor."}
{"text":"I read all the reviews and did my homework before coming here. The restraunt is beautiful.  But truly didn't feel the food was as good. Maybe my tastebuds are spoiled but I just wasn't getting what they were trying to do there..  

We had the duck fat fries they were cold..  They tasted like fries. 
We had the lamb burger- the chef charred my burger so I sent it back. Not what I thought it was going to be and I was so excited. I LOVE LAMB!! 
Both of my kids got doggie bags with most of the food in them and well they went in the trash. So maybe it was just off that night! I don't know. But it is a nice date place.  I'd go there for drinks and appetizers.."}
{"text":"Came here for a happy hour with friends and really enjoyed the restaurant. Really cool trendy decor. Very relaxed and casual but more upscale than your typical restaurant. Great happy hour prices and food options. There are definitely some good twists on traditional restaurant food and some options you don't typically see. I had their fish and chips and strawberry shortcake dessert. The dessert was out of this world and no complaints about the fish and chips. Non happy hour can be a little spendy but at least the food is good quality. Will come back if I'm ever on that side of town."}
{"text":"Great dinner date night spot!  Nice modern but cozy spot near pv- we came in at 9 pm reservation but would have been fine not to have a reservation at that time.  We were seated on the far west wall booths- was not too loud in the restaurant as it was not very busy.

I had the Blanche royale margarita which is the house blood orange margarita with Chambord and the hubs had a beer.  Once he tried my margarita he said he wished he had gotten a marg too! 

We started with the chorizo mushrooms and that was a great bite!! Loved the 6 yummy mushrooms and bread to soak the oil up.  Unfortunately the bread didn't seem fresh. It wasn't crusty or soft- just really tough.  I'd appreciate a lighter toast... Or a grilled rustic bread instead.
 
We got the chefs vegetable selection which was delicious- very light and straightforward. Lightly seasoned fresh ingredients included roasted cauliflower, lentils/quinoa, arugula, brocolini, grilled Bok choi, and a raw fennel & apple salad.  The cooked ingredients were delicious but the fennel & apples would have greatly been enhanced with a light vinegarette or perhaps a dressing on the side of the tray. The plain arugula did not annoy me as much but still would have benefitted from a dipping sauce option.

We also had the farm salad I think it was.  I remember the chewy bacon and creamy dressing.

Overall good but not outstanding.  Our server was very nice and professional.  We most likely will be back again to sample more menu items."}
{"text":"Great food. The staff is very friendly and professional. Great local craft beer menu. A definite must for visitors (like us)."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere. I would come back next time in phoenix. You must try the duck fat fries and stuffed mushrooms."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a 0 star review. My boyfriend and I went in there to start our dinner off at the bar with happy hour planning to have dinner following. The bar server was absolutely HORRID. Absolute garbage. We had to basically be assertive to stop the bartender to ask to order a drink, and we wanted to order food (a good amount too) but he or she never even asked. We were not greeted. We had to again assertively stop the bartender ask to pay out right away. We immediately left and went to a competitor a mile down the road. 

My boyfriend and I have been around the industry for a while so to be as excited as we were to try Salty Sow and have that start to make us so uncomfortable we felt like we had to leave, says volume. You can assure we will not be spreading the word to try here, actually quite the opposite. Wish I had a picture of the older lady bartender but I will post of the horrible male bartender who made us so cringe worthy we left. 

Wish we could have tried the food, but sadly because of the customer service we won't be back."}
{"text":"This wonderful, local, restaurant is minutes from our home and it took us a year to get there for our first visit...kept driving by and finally stopped. First of all, they have terrific staff members from the greeting team, wait staff and managers. Unique and fun menu. After my third visit this past week I thought it was time to give them a review and recommendation.  Try the appetizers (mushrooms, brussel sprouts, cheddar grits), the main dish (pork, lamb burger, chicken thighs)... flavorful! Definitely on our favs list!"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite restaurant of all time. Everything is amazing no matter what you order. The trout especially is superb, moist and fresh. I also love their cocktails and cheese board. My birthday is coming up and this is definitely where I will be celebrating!"}
{"text":"Food was great and outside patio was nice. Service was lacking as the waiter was not very attentive. We had to ask two other servers to get is refills on our water. Otherwise we really enjoyed to atmosphere and food.

The Happy Hour items we ordered were as good as always - Truffled Deviled Eggs & Honey-dipped Chicken & Biscuit.

We will be back!"}
{"text":"We love this place and are always surprised it isn't packed all the time.  The margaritas with the Serrano peppers in the ice cubes are a great option.  The polenta and pork ragu as well as the pork green chilli are the best things on the menu.  We've always had great service and have loved every dish we've had."}
{"text":"Just returned from the Sunday brunch. It's $25 fixed price. Bloody Mary's $5. Bloody Mary bar is nice. Good selection. The food was surprisingly good. Some was cold & not rotating out for fresh fast enough. 

I would give a much higher rating but the service ranged from bad to nonexistent. Our server blamed being over-sat at once. Maybe it was true but there was no manager roaming or assisting. The server didn't ask for help. He forgot our egg order and drinks took forever. Then he asked if we got the eggs yet and tried to blame the kitchen. We watched him walk over to place the forgotten order. He came out with them and made up some crap about the egg yolk being broken. It took almost until the end of brunch to get them. 

Then in the miserable and annoying style of all incompetent servers he kissed butt and made excuses as well as apologizing for his poor service when he bought the check PRIOR to us finishing. 

The food was good, but good enough to bring us back and to fight for dishes cleared, drinks we ordered, and food we ordered to arrive way to late? Nah. The management seems to have forgotten that there are dozens of other places to spend the same money and have it actually be FUN NOT A HASSLE"}
{"text":"The food is great the service is alright. They weren't outright rude but our order took over an hour and they were pretty slow. Our waitress avoided us instead of figuring out what was going on.  We tracked down the manager who swiftly took care of the issue. The chef apologized, they lost the order. No big deal it happens. Would have been nice if the waitress had just dealt with it but oh wells. The manager was great. The wait was worth it. The food was delicious. I'd go back."}
{"text":"Haven't seen your friend in a while? I know a great place to catch up.  The Salty Sow.

Close your eyes and point at the menu.  That's how you find something delicious at the Salty Sow.  Unless you are notoriously particular, you can't miss.  Your greatest regret will be when you taste the food of someone else in your party and it's not your own.  However, your solace lies on your own plate! 

Service is consistently good, and servers are skilled at pacing the meal, which, from my experience, isn't common among Valley restaurants.

If you're inclined to eat as much, I highly recommend the Chicken Liver Mousse.  The Asiago-Crusted Halibut is a menu staple, and with good reason.  Pair these with appropriate wines or  Salty Sow's signature cocktails, and a bad day gets good and a good day gets better.

Despite the above, I can't give five starts due to service when seated at the bar.  It's decent at best and slightly frustrating at worst.  In fact, in one instance, my 41 year old, salt & pepper-haired better half had a bartender almost make an incident over carding him.  In fairness, a superior (and the other bartender) quickly apologized on his behalf."}
{"text":"After reading the good and bad reviews, my husband and I decided to try it anyway figuring at the very least, we could grab a drink and an appetizer if nothing seemed appealing to us or if it was really overpriced.  The menus had a printing date of June 2013, so I'm guessing they have adjusted their prices according to the market and the complaints. A Peach Ale from Four Peaks was $5 ($4 on reverse HH) instead of the $7 I was expecting based upon another review.  Good to know they seemingly listen to folks.  The decor/ambience is pretty awesome and fills a void this area has been lacking.  Our server was extremely friendly and on top of things (minus one thing I'll note below).  We ordered the 110-minute egg duck fat fries as an appetizer.  They were good, but you have to mix the fries into the eggs, dip the fry into the egg and then into the sauce served on the side for the flavors to mesh well.  I wouldn't dip a fry straight into the sauce. As their name indicates, the sauce is really salty on its own.  Extremely good when dipped right.  We also ordered (from the reverse happy hour menu) a pork taco and the open-faced BLT to split.  The taco (yes, only one per order) is a pretty good size and was decent.  The pork was really smoky and smoked maybe a little too long because it was on the verge of being dry.  (Sidenote- we own our own smoker and are particular about how we like our smoked meats to be.)  The open-faced BLT was too much for us.  We had to ask for a steak knife to cut through it.  It was good, but, we were pretty disappointed that the menu didn't state that it came with french fries (or any side for that matter...it appeared to be an a la carte dish)-- nor did our server bother to tell us it came with a huge portion of fries.  Why on earth would we want MORE fires when we had your 110-minute egg french fry appetizer?  We didn't even touch one of them...such a waste of food.  Had we known, we would have definitely asked to sub it out with a side salad, even if it cost an extra buck or two.  We eat pretty healthy in general and so it was our \"cheat day,\" but, it was way too much fried food on one plate, even for a cheat day.  The bacon was really crispy, which my husband liked.  I like mine more grizzly/less done.  The tomato in the BLT is a fried green tomato and is really good.  They have a great patio for Fall/Spring if you are ever in need of a good patio to enjoy the day on.  All in all, we decided we would be back but it would most likely be for happy hour drinks and an appetizer rather than an entire meal.  Not bad, but a little too much of a fried/fatty menu for us personally.  Note- there are some healthy options on the menu, but some of them have random things in them that I'd personally like to modify out.  They won't let you modify SOME of the dishes, which prevented us from ordering those specific things.  I'd recommend at least trying this spot out, though."}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time tonight.  While the food was tasty and the menu was interesting, the service was just so bad I can't recommend this restaurant. We were seated right away on the patio (a plus! and we thought a good sign).  

Ambiance - too loud outside.  1 star
There was a very good local musician playing.  Unfortunately, it was very very very loud.  Loud enough to require constant yelling on the part of everyone sitting on the patio.  Perhaps it would have been quieter inside.  Outdoor cooling system broken. 

Service - Terrible.  No stars
We placed our order shortly after sitting.  We ordered appetizers and drinks.  Appetizers arrived right away.  Drinks were missing. We finished the app and 40 minutes later a runner brought our our entrees.  No drinks yet.  Halfway through the entree our waitress finally reappeared - it had been almost an hour since we had seen her. She refilled our water, but since we both had food in our mouths we couldn't actually talk. Still no drinks. Disappointing because the drink menu looked fantastic and I really wanted to try one. 

Food - pretty tasty - 3 stars
Green Chili appetizer - great flavor. Just the right amount of spice and served with homemade tortillas. Good for two to share. Not big enough for more. 
French dip - lots of meat. It is served rare. Good flavor, but not unique or different.  Fries are okay.  Nothing special. 
Pork Belly Salad - excellent bacon and pork belly.  Great flavors.  Unique combination of ingredients. The pieces are too big, which made eating it awkward.  Make sure you have a knife (if you can find your waitress).  But, this is excellent."}
{"text":"Can I just say OUT OF THIS WORLD!! Best food ever in town, our server (Shawn) was incredibly knowledgeable about the menu, we had the appetizers Garlic fries, Broccoli, Beet Salad with goat cheese, the fried Brussels sprouts, my kids my husband and I, we could of had the entire menu but we will have to make several trips back, I can't wait.
Keep up the taste and ambiance! Definitely a winner....LOVED IT!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing, did not expect the name to tie so literally to the food.  The duck fat fries with egg would have been very good but were ridiculously over salted.  My trout almandine was over salted but to a lesser degree, and was not flavorful.  Tried my daughters pork belly and it was sporadically over seasoned in places, but had decent flavor.  The grits and greens with it were good, but the bacon in the greens was over salted to point of being inedible.  Wife liked the tri tip tacos, only get 2 and a large bowl of beans.  Beans also terribly over seasoned.  Maybe kitchen had rookies with heavy salt hands working tonight, but it was really awful meal and my daughter and I did not feel well after due to the salt level.  Also because it felt like I had burned a hundred dollar bill.  Good service and atmosphere lifted rating to a 2."}
{"text":"Best charcuterie platter in TOWN!  The Brussels sprout Caesar salad was ridiculously good.  We went on a sunday so we opted for the porchetta roast specail- with crispy skin. FANTASTIC.  The star dessert is the bananas foster beignets- the best dessert I've ever had in my life, it almost made me cry..."}
{"text":"Loved there happy hour! The fries were good but not spectacular my favs were the fried chicken and the beef taco. We also had the banana foster beignets for dessert which was a great way to finish. Going to have to come back to try the other desserts and reg menu."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with my dinner this past Saturday night.  We waited at the bar until our table was ready.  The bar service was excellent and the bartender (a lovely lady) was attentive, funny and fast.   We only waited 15 minutes before our table was ready.  Our new server was quiet and shy, but otherwise friendly.  We ordered Fried Smashed Potatoes which were delicious and I ordered the Asiago-Crusted Halibut while my boyfriend ordered the PV salad and modified it with fried chicken.  Everything was going well until I noticed halfway through my dish a lovely piece of hair on the top of the sauce on my fish.  Immediately disgusted, I stopped eating the fish but I was still hungry so I decided to finish the smashed potatoes.  Really sad that this happened.  We're not ones for complaining and to be honest our waitress was busy attending to a 10 person party at the next table so we barely saw her after she gave us our check.  We paid cash and left.  Unfortunately, I will never return here.  Gave it two stars because the bartender service was great.  Maybe the kitchen needs to invest in hairnets?"}
{"text":"Went on Saturday night. Had reservations and it was crowded
But got seated right away. Had high hopes
For this place. Our server came right up and was very friendly.
Ordered drinks and appetizers. One of our group of 4 ordered Jim Beam on the rocks
She came back with drinks for 3 of us but
Said they were out of JB!! Geez Walmart is right across the parking
Lot. How can they be out of that! Appetizers were on the small side.
 Deviled eggs were just mediocre flavor and only 4 of them
And chorizo stuffed mushrooms were real small and only 6 of those.
Entrees took an hour more.The manager came over and apologized after
We complained to our poor server
But the manager just said \" it's out of my control. The chef does whatever he wants\"
I think You need to find a new manager. That is not an acceptable response.
We were just done with this place when the entrees finally arrived. Don't know if it was good or average, won't go back. Server tried hard."}
{"text":"Yikes! This place is really nothing but a beautiful shell in a great location! Went there when they first opened and it wasn't so good so we haven't returned until recently. We got the truffle
Deviled eggs with A mouth full of truffle and unseasoned dry arugula. Moving on, we got the specials. Surf and Turf. 2 of The smallest scallops I've ever seen wrapped in bacon accompanied by a really fatty filet which was small as well.
We also got the special pork chop which was over cooked, small and served with sweetened sweet potatoes, just terrible.
Drinks were however great! If you stop by make make sure it's only for happy hour and get a great cocktail and get out!! Looking for a better meal
With the same pricetag head up the road to Rusconis. Solid, committed chef. Always great food!"}
{"text":"Finally something unique ! I tried 8 different dishes and they were all awesome. I could not have asked for a better experience. Very good service from the manager Brian to our wait staff,you have to try this place."}
{"text":"Love this local spot! Great drinks! Great Brussels sprouts and grilled veggie board! Fun patio on great weather days!! Brunch is nice but way to expensive for a lighter eater."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere here! Somewhat dark, great place for a date night or going out with a good group of friends. The food is awesome, especially the burgers. Nice beer and wine list too. Worth a visit for sure!"}
{"text":"Had an awesome experience in the bar yesterday. Had a few cocktails and appetizers. The duck fat fries were great. I cook my potatoes in bacon fat so I was used to a great flavor. What really topped it off was the poached egg on top.

I'm a total whore for an egg on anything.

Brussels sprouts were darn good and so were the potato-bacon-tot things.

Solid old-fashioneds and nice pours all around.

Open kitchen like I love and the food coming out looked spot on.

Five stars for now. Will review again after I have a meal.

Note that they are not open for lunch on the weekend. BUMMER"}
{"text":"The open kitchen really allows you to get an appreciation for how much the chefs run around and never stop. The food was superb. The triple fried fries were astounding and surprisingly light. The braised shoulder brought me back to my childhood. It fell apart under my fork and the taste was immaculate. The lamb burger was succulent and the Brussels sprout cesear is a light option that had amazing flavors. The only downside of this place is that it is very loud and hard to hear the people you are eating with."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix. Every time we come here, the food and service are perfection. The specials never disappoint, and the all day happy hour on Mondays and Tuesdays is the best way to start the week. We need more places like this in the valley."}
{"text":"Amazing! My husband and I have recently dined several times at the Salty Sow. We have been well treated by the fantastic bartender, Brian. He is so thoughtful, professional, and attentive to his customers. The drinks are fantastic and made with care. The roast beef sandwich is to die for. Last night, Beth Cochran introduced herself and also made us feel so welcome. I can't say enough positive things about my experience at this restaurant."}
{"text":"I do love a restaurant that has happy hour every day (including weekends). Especially when duck fat fries, honey rosemary fried chicken and pork belly tacos, and deviled eggs on are the HH menu. The live music, tasty cocktails, and good service makes this a top choice for date night, girls night, or after-work cocktails."}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favorite places to eat! Excellent service, chill ambiance, and GREAT food!! Only my second time here, but from the first time I came here, I knew this would easily be my favorite place to eat. They have daily happy hour from 4pm to 630pm & we mostly ordered from this menu on this particular visit. Had their crispy brussels sprouts leaves.. holy crap! I cant say enough about this dish.. the absolute best, I wish I could have it everyday lol. I have to give a shout out to our server Holly cause she was so pleasant! Very friendly and attentive. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Very impressed with their first day!  Food was great (Green Eggs & Ham) and Pork Belly Taco!  I really like my Maple Glazed Old Fashioned (I can't remember if that was the exact name but I'm sure you can figure it out) was amazing.  It's great to have a place like this without having to drive down Scottsdale Ave to get to it.  I just might have found my new favorite hang."}
{"text":"Tried Sunday brunch...everything I tried was better than the thing before it. The chicken blew my mind, the green chili pork was spicy and decadent, cheese grits, biscuits...I could go on..I will...bacon, porchetta, ham, yogurt, fresh berries. The service was on point and it wasn't terribly crowded! A must!"}
{"text":"Well I'm torn. I am hovering between 3 and 4 stars for this place. I'm rounding to 4 because I enjoyed the food and we got a great deal on July 4th. We came for their buy one entree get one free event. My husband and I were really looking forward to their hanger steak dishes since it looked so appetizing in pictures. My hubby is a meat eater and he loves his steak. 
We started with the mushrooms and while they smelled very good, the taste wasn't quite there. The toast that came with it was nice but I honestly wasn't sure what to do with it. 
Then came the steaks- very pretty plate with thought put into it. The mashed potatoes were delicious, with a touch of sweetness in them. They were creamy and light. The steak was tender but there were only 5 pieces on the plate. I think my hubby died inside a little when he saw the plate. He ate his meal and enjoyed it but he ended up leaving hungry and I felt bad. For $24 a plate on regular days, there's just no way I would pay that much for such a small piece of steak. If I want to keep eating and Yelping, I gotta stay on budget! But with that said, for $12 a plate, it was a great deal. 
As my husband put it, when he eats steak, he wants an honest to goodness piece, not Gordon Ramsay's bull**** portions. So I'll have to leave him at home next time."}
{"text":"This place had an interesting menu. If you like food that is different yet has a home cooked feel this place is great. The service was great as well. Loved the ambiance and atmosphere. 

I was a little underwhelmed at a few things. The duck fries were delicious but I didn't care for the sauce. My husband liked it though. The goat cheese fritters were really good but the toast was a little bit TOO toasted. They're also HUGE and I prefer fritters smaller. 

I ordered the Brussels sprouts Caesar. It was great. I really loved the flavor. It had a bit of bite to it. Would love to go back and try something new. But as for what I had this first time I wouldn't be dying to go back. I rated it so highly because it takes reservations which is so rare nowadays for moderately priced places."}
{"text":"The food was very good!! Everything we ordered was tasty. The service was excellent! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Excellent! Great food, great atmosphere and happy hour prices! Easy to see why so busy all the time! Sad to see open table reservations are no longer an option!"}
{"text":"Bomb food. Little pricy but so good. Great burger too. Closed way to early of NYE though."}
{"text":"Completely happy with the superb service and very enjoyable food exoerience.  Ordered 4 happy hour plates; deviled eggs with truffles, honey chicken and biscuit, egg plant fries, and fish taco.  Had oak creek amber beer.  Our bill with tax was $32. 
Plenty to eat and very nice place albeit very busy with activity."}
{"text":"I am in the industry so I am VERY forgiving... but I do not have anything nice to say. Service at the bar was poor at best. It was our first time in and were given zero guidance by the bartender when informed they were out of pork belly. I orderedva mixed grill of roasted pig, or something along those lines, that was Sunday's special. I had TWO bites of the pork that I spit in a cocktail napkin out of approx 3/4 lb of meat...I anticipated fat, (I was looking forward to it actually) but this was just gross. The actual meat was so tough I couldn't chew it. 
As I said, I'm super forgiving, we ALL have bad nights, but (sorry Sunday night bartender) we will NEVER go back and I will NEVER recommend it. We have tried many times to get a table since they've opened,  unsuccessfully, I should have just taken the loss."}
{"text":"2nd time here. 1st time was for dinner and the food was not that great. Here for happy hour this time.  Duck fat fries are just fries with an egg on top and cold bernaise that taste like mayo with fresh herbs. The pork belly taco was too salty. The chicken liver mousse not impressive either. The only thing I enjoyed was the bread that came with the chicken liver. Won't be coming back. Overpriced mediocre food. They do live up to their name... salty food for sure."}
{"text":"We tried Salty Sow for dinner on a Sunday night. We had 2 appetizers-the deviled eggs and the chicken tarine. The chicken tarine was delicious. We tried a variety of dishes between 6 people. All of our dishes were good-French dips, salmon blt, burger, crispy chicken thighs and chicken soup. Our biggest complaint about the food was everything was under seasoned-which is ironic considering it's called the Salty Sow! Our waitress, Marena, was very friendly and attentive. We will try it again, maybe for lunch."}
{"text":"We have been regulars to the Sow since they opened their Phoenix restaurant.  This menu is for the adventurous and the hungry! Love the fried avocado with pulled BBQ pork and spicy fresca drizzled over the top. Smoked salmon toasts have a charred twist and pickled extras.  Their crispy chicken is perfect every time and their smashed roasted fingerlings are beautifully soft and crisp with bone marrow gravy smothering them to death.  Get excited for the giant pot that arrives to your table for the short rib entree. This dish is served cowboy style in a giant pot, with all of the cookout fixings... Carrots, potatoes and onion with the fried egg perched on top!  Whatever you do... Don't say no to dessert!  

The cocktails are trendy, manly and refreshing... All of the local brews you love and some new ones that the bartenders can passionately introduce to you !

The Sow also has a free membership card to rack up the points and ensure your loyalty!"}
{"text":"The service was good. The menu was not very inviting, and very expensive. Ordered the pork taco during happy hour, the pulled pork was somewhat dry and not seasoned very well."}
{"text":"Discovered this place during business trip to Scottsdale. Loved it so much went back twice! Fabulous happy hour, great small dishes, fun vibe, and decent beer/wine selection. Live music on Thurs, Fri nights & festive outdoor patio area with big screen tv's & gathering spots to hear the music or to just chill. Pork ragout with asiago polenta and basil was killer (scrumptious!) & the fried green tomatoes were good too. Wish I'd had the duck fries though. Our first night's service with Lauren (during a Thurs eve) was awesome & the live music (Ryan Sims) was fantastic; 2nd night back the bartender & our server weren't as attentive or stellar (maybe because it was a Sat night). Still, if I lived in the area, I'd be a regular here. The menu is incredible."}
{"text":"This was the first time I was here and the food and staff were just awesome! Our server Jacque was the greatest. I had the French dip and my girl had the vegetable plate we enjoyed both so much. The atmosphere was real pleasant and not hard at all to have a conversation with friends."}
{"text":"Unique food and good music. Little pricey but delicious and fun"}
{"text":"I've been planning and hosting a brunch for 10-20 people monthly for about two years now.  Salty Sow made its way as one of our favorite brunch places.  The staff was so accommodating, Mimosas and water flowed, constant rotation of new plates and utensils, and an awesome menu.  From my understanding, the menu changes. That's a good thing because we all plan to visit again.  

This past Sunday, November 19, 2017 we had a chance to indulge in the following:
Veggie Scramble, Green Chili Pork with tortillas, Caramelized Banana French Toast, Cheese Grits, Pork Belly Hash, Sausage, Bacon, Smoked Salmon, Honey Glazed Chicken and Waffles, Roasted Turkey with Gravy, Pork Belly Stuffed with Chorizo, Fried Green Tomatoes with Fresh Guacamole, Brussels Sprouts Cesar Salad, Roasted Beets with Goat Cheese and Pecans, fresh fruit, yogurt with granola, brownies, cookies, pastries and bagels.  All of that for $20 bucks!  I tried just about everything.  Everything was delicious ... however, because it's buffet style, some food items got cold quick!  You almost have to watch for the cooks to put new items out so that you can quickly get the food hot and fresh.  

Out of 12 of us, here were some of our favorites:
Veggie Scramble, Green Chili Pork with tortillas, Cheese Grits, Smoked Salmon, Honey Glazed Chicken and Waffles, Pork Belly Stuffed with Chorizo, Fried Green Tomatoes, Roasted Beets and the soft baked cookies. They were so soft and moist, delish!  Just a little note: The cookies look like they were chocolate chip and oatmeal raisin, possibly coconut in them.  I asked one of the cooks if the cookies had coconut in them.  He said I don't think so, no, no they don't.  Great!  I grabbed 2.  Upon first bite, coconut!  Glad I wasn't allergic.  

The only thing I didn't enjoy was the Chicken and Waffles.  I thought it was dry and cold every time I tried it (3 times).  Others loved it.  No one tried the Bloody Mary's but the Mimosas were sooooo damn good.  We can't wait to go back.  Salty Sow is definitely a crowd pleaser!"}
{"text":"Um, my gosh is this place yummy or what?  I ordered the duck fat fries and the pork ragout, both very rich and flavorful.  The service was great too.  I sat at the bar, and they frequently came over to see how I was doing.  They don't rush you out at all.  The atmosphere is nice too.  There was live music on the patio when I went there.  This place is very hip, but very inclusive."}
{"text":"My husband picked this place from yelp. When we arrived we were told that they only serve brunch buffet from 10am to 2 pm on Sundays. I wasn't looking for breakfast, but we had driven 34 Miles, so we decided to stay. 
Very glad we did. We tried the roast pork loin stuffed with chorizo sausage, honey rosemary fried chicken, hot smoked salmon, fresh fruit and berries, Brussels sprout Caesar salad, fried green tomatoes, roasted beets, and a mimosa for me. We also hit the dessert bar. Everything was good quality, freshly prepared, and very tasty.
Our server, Zack took great care of us, and we had a fun conversation.
All the employees seemed very friendly.
$19.95 for all you can eat
We will be back to try the lunch menu."}
{"text":"We drove by here on our way into town and just HAD to eat there on our first night!  It did not disappoint.    Everything was great.  The ambience and decor was cool, we liked the open kitchen, our waiter Tony was EXCELLENT, and the food was amazing."}
{"text":"Flying into Phoenix for my birthday before spending a few days up to Sedona to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary,  we were looking for a very good but casual restaurant for dinner, in proximity of our hotel, The Orange Tree Golf Resort on 56th.  We relied on one of my Paradise Valley friends to provide us with a recommendation.   
THE SALTY SOW DID NOT DISAPPOINT  !   Our experience there was top notch from the moment we were greeted at the front desk, throughout the entire dining experience.

The open kitchen at the rear of a large dining room with white-washed brick walls and enough room between tables where even \"Lickiweaks\" would find it difficult to listen in on a private conversation, had me convinced right off the bat,  that the recommendation for dinner at Salty Sow was an excellent choice.

Selecting one of the Craft Drafts that would be to my liking seemed difficult if it weren't for our waiter,  a very engaging gent' named MICHAEL, who could answer any question about each of the 12 (all) local brewery choices and helped me make a selection that met my taste in beer (I was born and raised in Germany)  FYITM Imperial Pale Ale was \"spot on\".   My wife opted for her favorite cocktail.

Mary and I decided to share the BRUSSELS SPROUT CAESAR as our appetizer.   Outstanding dish !   For our Main course,  we each selected the same RAINBOW TROUT ALMONDINE ....... not a single bone to be found  .....   its almonds toasted in BROWN BUTTER  (same as my mother used to bake some of her seafood dishes) was \"Killer\" !  The mild fish was matched with a combo of lentils, spinach, quinoa and crunchy capers and came with housemade tartar sauce.   Yum !

Bottom line:    Put SALTY SOW on your MUST visit list.  (of course, with some Texan influence, they are also known for their roasted pork dishes)   Prices are in the \"easily affordable\" range.  Noise level was \"moderate\" on a Tuesday,  couldn't say if it is - as some reviewers posted - a bit noisy on weekends.   (with a menu including eight House Specialties,  that's understandable)

{"text":"Great food, drinks, and great service is what you get at the Salty Sow.  If your are ever in Phoenix, please go out of your way to make at least one visit. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of approximately 20 people. They messed up our reservation so we had to wait a bit before we got a table, but was nice of them to accommodate us.

I ended up ordering a lot of items from the happy hour menu. I got tacos and duck fat fries. Taco was rather good! But those duck fries...oh man. I dream about them. Honestly would recommend just ordering a bunch of items from the happy hour menu and sampling them all.

They also have live music so that was nice!

Also, they split our check 20 ways for each person, and I thought it was very accommodating of them."}
{"text":"Called for a Group on 10 the same evening and they were super accommodating. We tried most of the menu and everything was amazing!!!  The duck fat fries were delicious and the pork belly entree melted in your mouth. The pricing was very reasonable and they were happy to split our checks. We live in MD and we could go back!"}

{"text":"Great location in Scottsdale, awesome building and who knew they have live music on a Thursday night! We all thoroughly enjoyed our meals our waitress was awesome and we left full and happy"}
{"text":"I have been to Salty Saw 3 times so far: first for the spring Restaurant week  - both food and service were amazing , but the items on the Restaurant week menu were not on a regular menu, so it is disappointing we cant have them again.
 
Last week i came back to salty Saw for my birthday dinner and they had the $25 Chef tasting menu - what a feast that was! We started with chilled cucumber soup, followed by tacos, then our party split and most people had pork shoulder with pork belly and grits, and my boyfrient ordered halibut. There was no wrong answer there - everything was delicios. Finished with super amazing brownies. And all of that was $25 per person. Unbelievable....My boyfriend\"s parents are well travelled and  accustomed to fine dining and they were saying that was one of the best meals they ever had.
Oh, and we got there before Happy Hour ended - $5 wine is not too bed either. 


It was so good we came back for dinner a few days later. This time I had pork belly with collard greens( cooked perfectly )which was very tasty, but my new obsession is the beer they have  - Full Moon ,a tastier version of Belgian white. 
Will be back for that soon"}
{"text":"The green chili stew is outstanding!  Their cocktails are unique twist on the traditional drinks.  The bone in filet is the best dinner value in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I went through and read other users low reviews and laughed. I'm appalled that someone can rank a place a 1 star for not finding the menu when it is CLEARLY listed on their website as well as their Yelp page and you never gone there yourself nor had an actual experience there. ANYWAAAYYYSS... I. LOVE. THIS. PLACE. I made reservations via opentable and in the comments added it was my sister's birthday since that was the reason for our visit. The hostess was very friendly and even wished my sister a happy birthday. Their cocktail list is made up of amazing concotions and my sister and I ordered a few and were happy with them all. Their food is awesome! A few items we ordered were the bone marrow, slow cooked beef shoulder, and pig roast (a special on sunday), as well as the happy hour honey chicken. D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S. I can't wait for my next visit to this great spot."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great customer service, fun patio (they can't help that it overlooks the Wal-Mart parking lot, LOL). Food is delicious and unique -- my kids, who are total foodies, also love their innovative menu! We went the first week this place opened and loved everything about it -- there is a sea salt caramel custard-type dessert that is to DIE for... And their deviled eggs are among our faves! This place does NOT disappoint. If you don't mind the Wal-Mart in the background (just turn a blind eye or sit inside if you do) -- then try Salty Sow for sure. If you are a hardcore vegan or vegetarian, this is probably not the place for you, however, their salads and cocktails are also scrumptious so pretty much everyone should give it a whirl! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"To start, they have the most expensive beers  in all restaurants in the valley, $7 for a 12oz local microbrew. Fourpeaks sells there pints for $4.50. The deviled eggs were pretty good. The $16 milk braised pork shoulder was bland and very small proportion. It was a basically white beans and pork. It wouldn't be a good stew for $8. The lamb burger may have been lamb, but who could tell. Bland and boring. I'm not sure spices are allowed in the kitchen. On the good side, the building and ambiance is awesome, but that won't make up for the poor quality if food. I was looking forward to the opening of this restaurant, but unfortunately I won't return."}
{"text":"Just got back from a Saturday night dinner at The Salty Sow.  First time.  What a great looking yet casual place it is.  Open kitchen layout, above the kitchen \"window\"  appears to be a chalkboard wall with drawings and the restaurants' name.  On the right side of the chalkboard is a drawing and next to is the word \"Merde\"--French for \"sh-t\". Who but me would notice that.  Too funny.  
Firstly, we ordered the sangria which contained basil, orange and grapes.  Very nice drink.  Also a Chardonnay which was quite good.  
We ordered one of the specials, Branzini (a fish)  that was served with fingerling potatoes and a salad.  I ordered a Roast beef sandwich with gruyere cheese on a brioche bun accompanied by fries fried in duck fat.  I figured those fries would be super-duper amazing. Duck fat? That's as close to Godliness as you can get.

When the food came hubby was quite impressed with the look of his plate. The bronzini, while quite thin and small, had a crispy skin and he said it tasted quite good.  The salad consisted of all types of greens including some roasted pepper strips and it looked well-dressed without being excessively oily.  I didn't get to taste it because it was not offered to me (if you know what I mean).  He also got 5 fingerling potatoes.  He totally enjoyed his meal and cleaned his plate.  In my head I was thinking that later on tonight, I would have to make him a little snack since he is used to having bigger portions---not piggy portions, just slightly bigger.  

My roast beef sandwich looked amazing and when I took a bite of it I realized that this was high quality meat.  However, I was not blown away by the sandwich.  I didn't say wow.  I didn't say YUM.  I didn't say much.  I added a little salt, but the flavor profile did not improve.  It was just another sandwich. Then I dunked it in the AU JUS which accompanied it and.... well..... it's still Just OK.  I also noticed that the gruyere cheese did not have the usual sharpness expected of a good gruyere.  It would have provided a welcome contrast to the meat.  Then I decided to seek refuge in the FRIES.  Yes, I thought ...the duck fried fries... just like in Paris.  

The first thing I noticed was that I had asked for them  to be extra crispy and they were blonde.  Blonder than my ex-husband's first wife.  I decided not to be biased against these blonde fries.  Wasn't it possible  that blonde fries could be delicious and scrumptious and irresistible????  I overcame my bias and tasted the fries that were fried in the almighty Duck Fat.  They were pretty good but not delicious, scrumptious or irresistible.  NOPE. NOPE. NOPE.  I generously asked hubby to taste them.  (Usually I would NOT be so generous).  He asked me,  \"Are these fresh ? They taste like frozen fries\".  Hmmmm.  Good point.  Could it be that these fries are merely fried in DUCK FAT for FLAVOR, but are not the real down home, peel the potatos, cut them and fry them version of french fries??  I wonder. Maybe I should have asked my server (who was very good by the way).  So in NO WAY, NO HOW do these fries even come close to the fries I get in Paris (especially at  AU BOUQUET Saint PAUL in Paris (in the 4th district for you guys heading to Paris).  When those Parisian \"frites\" arrive next to a steak with brandy peppercorn sauce what do you think I go for first?  I eat the fries first because life is uncertain.  I may have a heart attack when eating my steak and I will have missed out on the FRIES!!!!  My autopsy would say that I died not of a heart attack but of a \"broken heart\" because my stomach was deprived of those delectable fries.   
All in all the Salty Sow is a nice place to dine with its attractive atmosphere,  eclectic menu and great service.  Hubby was happy this time, I was not.  But that's the way it goes.  Maybe next time I will order something different and will walk out with a smile.  Who knows?"}
{"text":"Great fried chicken and Brussels sprouts leaves. Spinach artichoke fondue is just a dip, same as you can get anywhere, needed chiles or something. Pork belly taco with egg is light and wonderful. Will Def be back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing- pork green chili, salads, slow cook beef shoulder, deviled eggs, French dip, tacos and the list goes on.. The food is amazing! The only thing we had that has not been good is the bone marrow- some liked it, but it just wasn't for me. In addition to the fantastic food the service and drink list has also not disappointed.

This Sunday we tried their brunch, $18ish for a brunch buffet with tasty bacon, chicken and waffles, eggs and omelette by request. They also have out salads, pancakes, French toast with bananas and chocolate, pork green chili, pork belly hash, veggie and pastry options and so much more. 100% amazing, just wonder how long the buffet style will last- today was the second weekend and people slowly trickled in so the buffet was not over crowded and the chefs were able to keep everything hot and fresh, but once word gets out this place will be packed and I worry they will change the awesome setup."}
{"text":"This is an exceptional place to eat. The pork belly and fried chicken are out of this world.

The restaurant is a nice mix of indoors meeting outdoors depending on where you sit. Choose wisely though, it is AZ and hot!

The service here is wonderful and the food is great. Portion size is definitely large. The menu features a wide selection of entrees and great appetizers. For me the surprise standout was the Brussels Sprout salad (I got mine with no dressing). It is such a wonderful combination of flavors and crunch, you wish it was twice the size!

There is a full bar and decent wine and beer list for a restaurant of this type.  The dessert menu was a little on the small side for my tastes but overall I like that the menu was clear and had a reasonable number of choices not pages of choices.

All the staff was very helpful, the chef came out and checked on our meals, the owner or manager came by and chatted with us for quite some time and was a wealth of knowledge. My only real disappointment is that I don't live here so I can't come and eat here more often!"}
{"text":"Although the food isn't exactly up my alley, I come here because they are dog friendly on the patio and their bananas foster beignets are absolutely to die for.  The wine list is better than average and the theme and ambiance is very nice and rustic, but done in an upscale way.  We will continue to come here for the beignets.. The stuffed mushrooms are OK too, just the bread that they come on is way too stiff."}
{"text":"This used to be my all time favorite place so it pains me to leave this review. The service was mediocre. The kitchen came and placed our order on our table and came running right back to take it away since they placed it at the wrong table. It concerns me because they served it to the correct table and didnt care if we touched the food or not. We ordered the duck fat fries and they were soggy and cold. We ordered the 2 filets and they wouldn't cook each one different. The potatoes were also very cold. We received our steaks rare when we asled for medium well. It was too late to say anything because our waitress checked on us twice but both times when we hadn't even touched our food yet. Very very disappointed."}
{"text":"Maybe it just depends on the day of the week.  The waiter was nice but really slow.  We were seated, given the menu and then waited.  A couple was seated next to us about 5 minutes later, ordered and received their drinks.  Low and behold we had the same waiter, who then came to our table.  We received our water about 5 minutes after that.  It took about 20 plus minutes before we were able to have our order taken only to find out that they don't cook most meats they way you want but only the way the menu states.  We ordered two appetizers, ate, and waited another 10 minutes to get our check.  Not worth a revisit.  They don't make food the way you want but how they want.  If you like that along with a very long wait, this place might be for you, but it's not for me."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointing.  3 of us went on opening night, the food was mediocre, the service was good if you can ignore the waiter watching you all night, and the best part....all 3 of us were sick to our stomachs.    We will never go back."}
{"text":"My husband had a late dinner here tonight. We stop in every week/couple of weeks, as we live real close and the food and service is always excellent and reliable. 
Tonight everything was top notch - shrimp/avocado appetizer, club sandwich (one of the best I've ever tasted, ever) and a Caesar salad as the side...but here is where I need to stop. The Caesar salad components where excellent  - but the dressing was SO garlicky that it stopped me in my tracks. I asked my husband to try it, and he adores garlic, even raw garlic dipped in chocolate - but even he said that this was way over the top. I alerted our waitress, and she said she would pass on the comment, as the chef had already left for the day, but she was sure it was a one-off anomaly. However - after eating a few more bites of the salad I had another glass of excellent Rose, and then their outstanding berry cobbler, and even after drinking water non-stop after being home for more than one hour as well as rinsing my mouth out with mouthwash - all I can taste is garlic. Yuck. My next move is Apple Cider Vinegar. If that doesn't clear the taste, then I welcome your input.
Thanks."}
{"text":"This has become one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix. I've had dinner four times here in the last year, and each time, the food is fantastic, service is great. Highly recommend the prime rib (if you like medium, order medium rare, their version of medium is closer to what i'd call medium well), although the beef shoulder is also delicious, as is the french dip, and, oddly enough, the fish and chips (my husband's favorite). Amazing selection of both wines and beers, the deviled eggs are wonderful, and top it all of with the butterscotch budino. Delicious! The ambiance is really nice as well, perfect date night restaurant. I can't recommend it enough!"}
{"text":"I would guve this place a 5 but the last time I was there was super shootie and I donz pay all my hard earned money for half done.. On the other side there is live performances on weekends and the food is always good. The drinks are usually rly good but u have talk to them about the drinks and figure out what you like, a lot of them are hot.."}
{"text":"10/10. Amazing food, nice beer selection and an outstanding staff. I make my way to AZ 3-4 times a year and the Salty is always a stop on the tour."}
{"text":"We went for happy hour; started w just two of us.  Food was good, drinks were great, service was just okay.  Our waiter was a little bit unfriendly but ultimately didn't mind much.  Our friends joined later and we moved the six of us outside to the patio, which was gorgeous.  Would definitely come back...great spot for HH."}
{"text":"Though I give this establishment four stars, I give the bananas foster beignets five plus stars.  OMG those are good.  I'd say skip dinner and go straight to those babies, but honestly, dinner was good too.  Either way, save some room and get the beignets... you won't be disappointed.  Trust me.

As for food, I had a french dip sandwich... it was fab.  I wish it was served a little bit warmer, but overall I would highly recommend it.  The hubs had a pork roast.  It was Ok, but had A LOT of fat on it.  I think he would have enjoyed it more if it had been trimmed a bit... it was also a smaller portion than one would have expected for the price.  Our service was great, especially considering we were STARVING and looking to get food ASAP.

We're so happy this new restaurant have popped up near to home.  We will surely be back, especially for those beignets.  Dear lord those were good..."}
{"text":"I had seen the Salty Sow while in Paradise Valley area, and I always wanted to try them out. So I scheduled my birthday dinner here and I was not disappointed!!! They had an unusual menu but I am pretty adventurous. We tried basically everything on the Happy Hour menu. I have to say the Rosemary Honey Chicken was by far my favorite!! I'm a country girl and fried chicken is my weakness!!! The duck fat fries were crispy and full of flavor and I loved the 110 minute egg on top. We also tried their meat and cheese tray( I can't remember the name exactly). I really enjoyed the goat and cow cheese blend, I even tasted some of the chicken liver pate and it was pretty good.    All in all we had a great time and they gave us a huge table to ourselves (7 people). They even have live music on Thursday nights which is a huge plus in my book!!! I will definitely be back in the future!"}
{"text":"Even though the food is very fatty and salty, we love it here! The atmosphere, service, and food are great. It's the Perfect place to wind down after work or on a date night. The green chili and tortillas appetizer is one of our favorite items. We will be back for sure, most likely on a cheat day!"}
{"text":"Service is always great! Pricey, but the food is amazing and worth trying for a great date night. We love the happy hour...my favorite is the sangria even though I don't normally like white, their's is awesome!"}
{"text":"Salty Sow is a tough one to review, I'm afraid. While I was underwhelmed by the food, especially considering the prices, I was very pleased by the interior decor and by the service.

Being a budget-minded guest (whether I like it or not), I visited Salty Sow on a Monday night with a friend. Salty Sow had an all-night Happy Hour that night, which is what drew us.

Unfortunately, the HH list was pretty unimpressive, featuring options \"for sharing\" like the $5 tacos where you only get one small taco for the price. How does one share a single taco...?

After deciding that we weren't interested in spending $5 for a single small taco, we placed an order for the Duck Fat Fries to start with ($5). They were tasty, and well presented.

My friend ordered the Honey Rosemary Chicken off the HH list ($7) and was very impressed with it, as was I. The chicken was perfectly cooked (so moist!), the breading for the chicken was really well done (crunchy!), the sauce was delicious, and the biscuit was outstanding.

I ordered the double cheeseburger ($15) and was (unfortunately) far less impressed. Took about three bites and left the rest behind. Nice big patties, nice presentation, \"just eh\" flavor.

Based on the food, coupled with the high prices and small portion sizes, I'd give Salty Sow a pretty low rating. However, based on the exceptional level of service we received from our server, Shelby, and the beautiful interior, I have decided to raise my rating to a 3-star review.

Would I come back? Likely not for food. I think I would visit again, though, if I wanted to grab a drink somewhere upscale and comfortable with beautiful interior.

Between the real wood features and decor, creative lighting, appropriately subdued background music, and high-end service, I could see visiting Salty Sow again for a lighthearted first date (drinks only) or to catch up with an old friend.

Thank you, Shelby, for treating my friend and I so well. You were great. And thank you, Salty Sow, for creating such a beautiful ambiance and mindful decor."}
{"text":"the food is very good but $24 for 4 scallops?  really... at least let me know that it is just an app and not a main course"}
{"text":"UH-mazing food. Reasonably priced, really nice atmosphere, super nice staff. I had the pork belly and it was crunchy, yet melting-in-my-mouth-buttery perfection!!! So good!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delightful, their brunch is the best! Great ambiance, great staff and beautiful space. Affordable quality food!"}
{"text":"We've experienced Happy Hour/Dinner at Salty Sow, which has been delicious, and yesterday we participated in their first ever Sunday Buffet Brunch.  During Happy Hour my husband and I started with an order of the Truffled Deviled Eggs and the Blood Orange Margaritas, we enjoyed both.   For dinner I had the Pork Belly and my husband ordered the Prime Rib (a great deal at $29).  Both meals were delicious and included side dishes, we certainly left feeling full. 

Now on to yesterday's Brunch.  Loved it!!!  The cost was $21.95 which included unlimited trips to the buffet.  The buffet had a wonderful selection including green chile pork stew (topped with a poached egg if you wanted), fried chicken and waffles, biscuits and gravy, sliced turkey with gravy, white corn cheese grits, chocolate chip French toast, fried green tomatoes w/guacamole, lots of pastries, maple cured bacon, sausage, and eggs cooked to order.  Mimosas were $4 and the Bloody Mary Bar was $5.  We both opted for the Mimosas which were in good size glasses, not like those mini-mimosas some restaurants serve.  We enjoyed our brunch on the beautiful patio and were lucky enough to have Candace as our server.  She was friendly, informative, and quick to make sure we had everything we needed.  All in all, a perfect start to our Sunday!  We'll definitely be going back for Happy Hour, Dinner, and Brunch and taking friends when they come in to town to visit."}
{"text":"Seriously good food. We came in for happy hour and got the fried green tomatoes,and the rosemary and honey dipped fried chicken. Both were cooked to perfection and the service was great!"}
{"text":"Best happy hour in paradise valley! We love seeing Tony - he's the best server ever!!

Food-wise - chicken liver mousse, duck fat fries and the lamb burger are off the hook! 

Get there before happy hour ends and enjoy the great food at a lower price and a good discount off adult beverages. 

Patio and live music are totally awesome. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Top of the line rustic food. Consistently nice and great service. Friday's (I think) has nice light acoustic guitar music on the patio."}
{"text":"This place is incredible.

Service was outstanding.  

The food was delicious.  The duck fat fries and tacos were our favorites.

My fiancee said the drinks were strong and tasty.  

They have all-night Happy Hour on Mondays & Tuesdays.

We will definitely be back.  If you haven't been in yet, don't miss it!"}
{"text":"You have to come for happy hour!  The deviled eggs are smooth as silk.  Creamy. Melt in your mouth.  I didnt want to stop,lol.  There are 4 on a plate, easy enough to share....if you want. ;)

The honey rosemary fried chicken has 2 large nuggets and a buttermilk bisquit in a puddle of delicious honey sauce.

We were seated right away and our orders were taken swiftly.  Our waitress was very nice and checked on us often.  There is a loud bell that ends \"Happy Hour.\"  All and all, I am very please with my experience  here and will come again."}
{"text":"Guuuuurrrrrl, I've been here a million times (remember this...it becomes important later). I dig this place like I built it myself. The trendy vibe and creepy ass pig paintings with human eyes, really makes the ambiance of this place fun. When I am trying to impress people, I take them here for Happy Hour. You wouldn't expect a place like this to share a shopping complex with the breastraunt, The Titled Kilt, or Walmart...or Michael's, the craft store. But through all that, the Sow shines as a fiery beacon that this neighborhood is worth it. The duck fat fries are killer. I don't always eat the egg they put on top, but the fries are outrageous. When I'm feeling the stress of life, I eat those suckers for Happy Hour. Unexpectedly, they have BOMB ASS tacos. I do not eat green food very often, because like many, I believe most of it to be rabbit food. HOWEVER, the brussel sprouts at the Sow slay meeeee. They are crispy leaves of perfection with some golden raisins and pecorino. I haven't met anyone who hasn't liked those little leafy bastards. The Sow does that right for sure. The bar set up is also excellent; people watching galore. I didn't give 5 stars because the menu feels stagnant. I stopped being impressed by the third visit, because there is rarely anything new, which is a bummer. THAT BEING SAID, I still go there, and I will keep going there, but not too often or I will feel the same tinge of disappointment when I see that things are exactly the same. Still delicious, but the same. 

AWESOME for date night, Happy Hour, or dinner to impress in-laws who love comfort food and delicious veggies."}
{"text":"The Food here is always AAAAmazing !!!! 

Had brunch on Sunday for the first time the other day and it was outstanding!"}
{"text":"My mom, who is also my boss at work, took me and my coworkers to salty sow as a Christmas work lunch treat because they now serve daily lunch. Our service was prompt and thorough with drink refills, and the food was fantastic. I don't remember if I went here previously or not but this time I remember what I got was fantastic. The rosemary honey dipped fried chicken.. so sweet and savory, a perfect umami combination. Right now I'm craving it so badly. The guy I'm dating loves this place as well, so we may come back together and indulge in this ultimate goodness."}
{"text":"Met up with a good friend recently for some beverages, dinner, and catch up.

This place is really nice, with a variety of seating and  a very reasonable noise level.  Our server helped us get settled in and recommended drinks and appetizers to start off with.  SS has HH every day of the week so we were able to take advantage of that pricing to try duck-fat fries, crispy Brussels-sprout leaves, a lamb burger, and a French dip sandwich.  The bar whipped us up some delicious blood orange margaritas to go with the feast.

This place has so much going for it!  The food was really wonderful, the drinks were fabulous, the service was warm and gracious, and the management stopped by to chat.

All in all, Salty Sow is a great experience.  Can't wait to try it again!"}
{"text":"Great portions. The lunch menu is amazing! The fried chicken is phenomenal. Big portion."}
{"text":"For the record this place's menu is obviously heavily weighted on pork, hence the name Salty Sow.  Not being a huge pork fan, I have had the brussels sprouts and the chocolate truffle cake.  I haven't had any desire to eat anything else because they are SO good!  I don't even like Brussels sprouts!  

The cocktails are pretty descent here too...along with the chocolate truffle cake!! Maybe someday I will get myself to order something else; I am sure many other items on the menu are just as delicious!"}
{"text":"Reviewing it just for the brunch, but even that totally needs the shout-out. Been looking for some basic unlimited eggs, bacon, potatoes, and all the classics, but all the hotel buffets in Scottsdale were super expensive! Man I don't need prime rib for breakfast! So I was super happy I was able to find something for $25. 

You're definitely paying a little more - when you can go to all these awesome breakfast places around for dishes in the high teens. But with those places, sometimes there are some dishes better than others, or trying everything want costs a little more than you want.

At Salty Sow you're paying for the variety, and honestly every single thing I had was on point. The main stars of the porchetta and turkey was ridiculously moist and well-seasoned. The chicken and waffles - crispy yet juicy bite. And pretty much every classic breakfast staple was great, from the scramble, the pork belly hash, and an incredibly creamy cheesy grits. 

If I were to get one plate at an a la carte restaurant would be phenomenal, but to have 2 or 3 all be that good is fantastic - and that's without tapping into any of the mimosas or Bloody Mary's!

Regardless of the buffet format, the taste of the food alone at Salty Sow put it at the top of breakfasts I've had in Scottsdale. Food so good that I not only will come back, but will also try their lunch/dinner as well."}
{"text":"Love love loved their brunch buffet. The fried tomatoes were super yummy! Our server was pleasant and attentive. The decor was super cute as well.  Great Sunday Funday brunch place! I will be back!"}
{"text":"I went here in a date night for Valentines Day and was in such ah of the restaurants set up not to mention the service and food was spectacular. Definitely will return! This is a spot where everyone should go to wether a date night or just grabbing a bite to eat it's well worth it!"}
{"text":"Eating here was a treat.  The service was great, and food even better.  The drink I had was a bit light.  I describe the food as American soul food, with a unique flare.  When I mean American soul food, from different parts of our great country, like collard greens, beet salad and pistachio, pork belly entrees, fried veggies, beignet and ice cream, which is what I had and all foods that may not be the healthiest, but oh so good in taste.  This will be a place to return to, to venture other tasty dishes."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here to get appetizers and drinks and I couldn't have been more impressed. They have a great happy hour menu and even better signature drinks. I highly suggest the duck fat fries and chorizo stuffed mushrooms. Go here for great food, great drinks, and awesome service."}
{"text":"The green chile stew appetizer is a must. Duck fat fries were tasty, and the French dip was delicious.  Great service until it was time for the tab. Odd."}
{"text":"Oh Salty Sow, How do I love thee, let me count the ways:

1) Michael Hales, THE MOST professional server in Scottsdale! If you can get in Michael's section you will be very happy as he takes his job very seriously yet is always smiling and makes even the mundane task of reciting the specials a fun culinary adventure.

2) pomegranate mojito - so refreshing on a hot summer day.

3) duck fat fries - need I say more?

4) chicken thighs with neck bone gravy - you MUST taste this dish!

5) smashed fingerling potatoes - so smart, so simple, yet no one else has ever thought of this...order this please.

6) tomatoes with homemade ricotta - I could devour a plate of these all by myself...almost did...but I had to be \"polite\" and share them with my dinner mates. Next time I want my own.

7) rib eye steak - order it rare plus for THE most tasty steak!

8) elevated booths with foot rails - by far the most comfortable seating. 

9) atmosphere - I LOVE the decor and the comfort this place offers. So cool, you won't feel like you are in a shopping center rather you WILL feel like you are in the hippest locale with beautiful people all around you.  They are all lovin the food and the atmosphere.

10) in short, even if you are not a pork lover, like one of the members in our party, no worries...as the menu has everything to offer and although its called \"Salty Sow\" rest assured you will find many things to love on this menu."}
{"text":"This place is pretty new and is amazing. Love the decor and layout.  The whole style is southern style but chic.  I ordered the prime rib sandwich and it was amazing, along with the avacado and fried green peppers.  Service was great, extremely prompt! They have an eclectic drink list and good wine to choose from, a tad high on the wine but not too crazy.  I'm looking forward to coming back when it cools down as they have a great patio area with misters that looks just perfect for happy hour."}
{"text":"I'll admit, I'm kind of obsessed with this place. In fact, my hubby had to hold a minor intervention when I was visiting multiple times per week!
The staff is great, the food is AMAZING-I haven't tried a thing I didn't like, and they have great happy hour specials. 
It's a must-try!"}
{"text":"Good fun and a nice atmosphere. The menu is geared for adults versus the family. The server knew the menu well and was helpful with making selections."}
{"text":"Best fried chicken and biscuit I've ever had! The honey gravy was sweet and herbal. I'm very picky when it comes to margaritas, and their frozen marg was perrrfect. Strong and not too sweet. The manager was busy checking each plate before it was served, and made it to our table to check on us on the way out. Very comfortable atmosphere and five star service.  Only in town for a few days, but will be sure to go back!"}
{"text":"What a great meal.  Atmosphere was cool.  Service was quick and efficient.  We had the Deviled Egg appetizer and it was awesome!   I had the roasted Pork and subsidies the side with zero problems or cost.  I would definitely recommend to a place for dinner.  Seemed family for friendly too!"}
{"text":"The first time I came here I was not impressed.  It was however the first couple days they were open and wow what a difference!  The appetizers are obnoxiously good.  The happy hour menu is going to keep me coming every chance I get just to get the Pork belly taco and the honey rosemary dipped fried chicken.  They were both fantastic.  The pork belly taco is something I think about a bit too much since I haven't been back in a couple weeks, a mistake I will correct shortly! I also really enjoyed the french dip sandwich with duck fat fries, but may have to stick solely to happy hour to get those other two."}
{"text":"I've been in the restaurant biz for over 40 years. This restaurant is AMAZING! From the  front of the house (thank you,Beth),to the back of the house, everyone 'gets it.\" It's VERY hard to find this combination in the Scottsdale area. Service was awesome!(make sure you ask to sit in Lauren's section). There's something on the menu for just about everyone, especially if you consider yourself a \"foodie.\" The whole place has a really good vibe. Teamwork is in it's prime here. Do yourself a favor: take all of your in & out of town guests here...NOW!"}
{"text":"There is nothing on the menu I liked. This is a fancy bar with bone marrow and that kind of fare with most dishes starting at about $18. The whole chain doesn't carry Bud products or similiar, they just use local beers. The beers start at 5 bucks post happy hour. It was mostly empty at the bar on Sunday night and the bartender from Sweden looked bored. The rest of the joint had birthday parties and was crowded. The TV's are placed way too far from the bar area and don't bother going here to watch games, you will need a telescope to see the TV's from the bar. I get it, not every place is made for the everyday guy, so fair enough, so everyday guys be warned."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this restaurant. It has an inviting dimly lit dining room and relaxed bar. We usually stop in for a bite before heading out on the town. I've tried many of the items: duck fries, Brussel sprouts, the beef tips, the pork even the mousse, stuff made out of something I'd rather not know, was incredible. 

The specialty drinks are also well thought out and not the same old Manhattan or house margarita.. There are options, using the good stuff!! That's what we love about this place! 

The food is satisfying the drinks are original the ambiance is energetic and mature. You can dress up or be casual you'll fit in just fine:) I highly recommend this place. We've been there at least a dozen times and have never been disappointed. IMO the bar top is the best seat in the house."}
{"text":"I Love slalty sow. I've been here a few times and I'm bummed it's been so long since I've gone back. After this last experience I will be coming more often. We were immediately greeted and served at our table which is always a positive for me. Our drinks quickly came and our server was very quick and efficient. I'm so glad I ordered the bone in filet (or whatever it was called) because it was so good. Last time I was here I don't remember all the beef options but wow, they stepped up their game if it's a new menu. My friend got the special which was a steak panini and wow, hers was so good too!!
 I left so happy here. Our server took great care of us. He made sure our drinks weren't empty and we were happy. I can't stand when servers either don't come by enough or come too much, but our server was perfect. I will definitely be back soon! For the quality the price is very good as well! I would expect for this quality I'd pay at least 30% more. I'm so happy I made the decision Saturday night to come."}
{"text":"I had dinner at the Salty Sow for the first time and will definitely be back.  Thought the truffle deviled eggs were full of flavor.  Also had the crisped chicken thighs with potatoes--the chicken was crispy and moist--really some of the best chicken I have ever had--the potatoes were also had a great deal of flavor.  A dining companion had the chili rubbed tuna--which she said had wonderful flavor--hope to try that another time."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for drinks and a bite.  There is a live band on Friday that plays covers from the Stones to Van Morrison.  Good for either a date night or just drinks with friends.  The beer selection isn't the greatest but still enough selections to please most palates.  

I was a big fan of the roasted beet salad.  It had a delicious tangy vinaigrette that was amazing.  I would order that again every visit.  

The lamb burger was good as well.  It was huge and had a good sauce as well.  I don't think I would reorder it as some other items on the menu looked much better.

I also tried the fried brussel sprouts and green chile stew.  Both were tasty.  The green chile stew could have had some more heat but the flavors were very good.

I am looking forward to coming back and trying out some other dishes."}
{"text":"First meal in town. Greeted with a friendly smile. Seating was comfortable. Chelsea, our waitress, answered all of our questions and offered suggestions. The drinks were fabulous. He ate the pork belly and said it was wonderful. I had fish and chips. Everything was tasty. Creme Brule was the perfect ending to the perfect meal. Located near our new home, we will certainly be back."}
{"text":"+super friendly and attentive (but not annoying) waitresses. 
+relaxed and comfortable decor

- Pork tacos are only on the happy hour menu.. What?!? it should be a staple for a place with \"Sow\" in it's name

would highly recommend this as a happy hour place"}
{"text":"Highly disappointed with this place. I just attempted to eat here. Hostess sat us. 30 min later still no drink order. Still nothing. Just had to finally get up and leave. That is sad because we were repeat customers. Sorry Salty Sow.... Won't be visiting you ever again."}
{"text":"So I must say... bacon is a good thing! and the Salty Sow delivers the goods!!!  Made my first visit here last night and was extremely satisfied with the ambiance, friendly staff & great food.  The bar is welcoming for those (like myself last night) who dine alone with a couple TV's to catch some game action.  Now its not a sports bar atmosphere but when you are having a drink and some eats by yourself its nice to have the 'ol tube (did I just date myself?) to watch.

At the bar they have a great selection, although not huge, of local craft brews from brewery's around the state.  The bar tenders where, prompt and pleasant with their service.  The kitchen was equally as efficient even on a busy Saturday night - my food arrived almost to quickly.

Now speaking of the food, the menu had a wide range of interesting starters, salads and entrees - many with bacon/pork incorporated in some unique way..  I ordered the pork shoulder, and why not right?  Its the Salty SOW after all!. It was fantastic!! the right balance of fat and flavor with a complementary seasoning that worked perfectly.  I saw another bar dinner with the beef shoulder that looked amazing so on my next visit I will definitely give that a try.

Oh.. and they have a nice open patio a with a live musician that wasn't to loud but sounded great.  The Salty Sow would be a nice gathering spot for a large group of friends for sure.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant reminds me if being in Austin.  Great live music and fabulous slow cooked food. Everything was wonderful, starting with the ambiance and waitress, and of course the food. 

I had a crispy brussel sprout salad that was a perfect taste blend of a Cesar salad with shaved bussel sprouts, golden raisins, cranberries, and pecorino cheese added. I also ordered the filet mignon and it hands down beat Flemings. The beef itself was flavorful and the sear was perfect. Mashed potatoes with a rustc flair and crispy, not oily onion strings and a flavorful Demi glace finished the plate. I also had the Butterscotch Bourdino for desert...wow. 

Everyone from the bartender to the busboy and most importantly my waitress were upbeat and seemed to love working here. I had a great experience and highly recommend Salty Sow"}
{"text":"The food here was good, but not exceptional.  We tried the stuffed mushrooms appetizer which was small but tasty, but nothing to write home about.  My son tried the Duroc pork belly which was very good, he was well pleased.  I had the French dip sandwich.  Something about the brioche bun just didn't work well with the au jus dip.  The sandwich would have been much better with a more substantial bread to soak up the well done savory liquid.   The duck fat fried French fries were very good, reminded me of McDonald's fries in the days when they used animal fat for french fries.   It is a nice restaurant but just didn't meet our expectations."}
{"text":"I had looked at the reviews and decided to try this place. First, I ordered a glass of wine. The waitress literally told me it would be 20 minutes. Wow, so apparent
Y you don't want me ordering drinks. Next, I ordered the French dip. It was terrible. I honestly can not understand why so many positive reviews. If your looking for a restaurant that is far superio, and of the same cuisine try houstons on Scottsdale rd."}
{"text":"Have been a few times and about time I showed Salty Sow some love. The food has been incredible every time I've eaten here. Big fan of the bone marrow to start. Cudos for having the balls to put something like that on your menu. 

The staff has made the experience every bit as enjoyable as the food. Always friendly, knowledgeable and willing to go above and beyond to ensure the best possible dining experience. 

Have to mention that I was really impressed by my first visit when the management helped my wife coordinate a surprise 60th birthday dinner for my mother-in-law with 20+ people, on a Friday night no less. Was blown away by how great the staff was and how smoothly the night went. Thanks for everything! You have gained some loyal guests who will continue to call this place one of their favorite restaurants!"}
{"text":"I have came back to Salty Sow...thinking it would be better. The food is okay.. they have a wide variety of items...However, the service is slow and out of all the dishes I have tried nothing was amazing. They do have happy hour which might be a better option.. They do have a nice atmosphere though."}
{"text":"A nice find for foodies in an unsuspecting outlot by the Walmart.  Service was great and the food was even better.  We ordered the Fried Green Tomatoes at the recommendation of the server.  Unfortunately the app arrived at our table after the salad due to a lost ticket in the kitchen which is the only reason why I give this restaurant 4 stars instead of 5.  The Farm Salad was wonderful and my mom mentioned the dressing was probably the best she's ever tasted and was big enough for us to share.  I ordered the Bacon & Eggs which was rich and delicious.  Mom ordered the Bacon wrapped pork filet and the flavor permeated throughout the meat.  It had unbelievable flavor.  I had the Full Moon Belgium Wheat which was really nice if you like belgium wheat beers.  Salty Sow was an amazing find."}
{"text":"First time here and my husband were super excited to try it out.  The place is beautiful, ambiance is great, our waiter was very nice.  The food was not what I expected, the menu items don't flow (look them over and I will understand). We had the pork tacos and I would suggest serving them on a corn tortilla, the Duck fat fries were not exactly the bomb, the salad was warm.  The wine glass was dirty and the waiter didn't even poor the wine.  I can say we will not be back as our first experience
was not one to remember.  Always on the hunt for a great meal!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is relaxing, the food is very delicious and the service is great!!! Definitely will be returning!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner here last weekend. The food is creative. On Sunday, they cook a whole pig and serve slices. The Italians call this porchetta. The restaurant puts a sign out on Cactus to let motorists know. It's worth a visit just for this dish if you're up for hearty fare. I left tthe pork to my husband and had grilled octopus. It was perfectly cooked and quite tender. It came served with fingerling potatoes, roasted red peppers, and endive. They have creative selections as starters on their happy hour menu, too. We shared roasted, shaved Brussels sprouts with Parmesan topping. We finished by sharing the flourless chocolate cake which was better tasting than most. Our server, Michael, was professional and very personable. The atmosphere is pleasant with a great soundtrack of rock, blues, and country mix. Prices are moderate.

This is an update from March 2016:

My husband and I like to come to this place at happy hour. They always have some great specials and drink prices are reduced. We do order off the regular menu, too. One of our favorite items is the shaved Brussels sprouts salad. I tried the catfish tacos off the happy hour appetizer list. They were as good as the catfish we've had in the South. It was very fresh with no earthy taste, and the breading crispy. Other small plate  items we tried were fried eggplant, pork belly tacos, and the fried chicken. All were delicious. Prices are reasonable. Service professional especially the bussers and kitchen runners. As previously mentioned, I love the soundtrack of blues, rock, and soul, too."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here pretty often and have never been disappointed. Service is always great and the food is amazing. Earlier today, we dropped in to try their brunch because I noticed a sign there last time talking about their Sunday brunch. It was definitely better to expected! We both left so full and guilty because we said we'd be better with what we eat but it was too good to resist. With family coming into town this month, we're going to try to get them to come with us for brunch. Thanks for another great meal!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the BEST Deviled eggs in AZ!!! Their happy hour is awesome and I highly recommend their Brussel Sprouts Salad! Oh and their Chicken thighs plate!"}
{"text":"This is a great, cool, trendy restaurant.  Plain and simple, but there's nothing plain and simple about it.

I've had the brussel sprouts, eggplant fries, and goat cheese fritters appetizers... all spectacular.   

The asiago crusted halibut is to die for.   My friends have had the pork, steak, salmon, and salads and we have all enjoyed our meals immensely.

The servers are always friendly and efficient.  

It's a fun place with a great menu.   

Several restaurants at that location have come and gone, but I am truly rooting for this one to thrive."}
{"text":"I did salty sow on a Wednesday night. Good parking and nice dining room and bar. Decent tap beer list for a modern gastropub. It was nice to see the local Sun Up brew at a restaurant here in town. I ordered a $12 cheeseburger and asked them to hold the mustard. Of course it arrived covered in mustard. How can you taste anything when it is overpowered by mustard? I returned the cheeseburger and waited for the replacement. The manager was kind enough to bring me a couple deviled eggs while I waited. I tried one but all I could taste was lemon juice. When the replacement burger arrived, It was immediately evident that the cooks had gotten revenge. The patties were burnt beyond any recognition. I had never got to have a burger and the waitress had the Gaul to charge me for it. I won't go back. There are too many places that make good food and care."}
{"text":"Love the staff.  Holly the server has great knowledge and guides you through the menu like an Ace!   Kevin Bird, GM and bartenders are really nice.  So glad they have to come to our neighborhood to up the anty!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, food, and atmosphere. Came here with the wife and friends after an all day ce course in need of food and none of us were disappointed. Had the slow-cooked pork shoulder which was so tender and full of flavor. The fried smashed potatoes were also excellent."}
{"text":"Unfortunately did not get to experience the food, we didn't get that far...
Walk in and there were only a few people waiting. I stand in front of the hostess stand where the hostess is having a personal conversation with a waitress, I waited a few seconds for her to greet me and nothing. I had to say, \"hello?\"  She then took my name and said the wait would only be 15 mins. 10 minutes goes by and 3 different couples walk in within that time and get seated right away. I walk up and ask the waitress why and she replies with, \" you will be seated shortly.\" AN OTHER couple gets seated! We walked out and went across the street to Tilted Kilt where we got 10 times better service. Not sure I will return"}
{"text":"This only got a 3 and probably should have gotten a 1 for worst service. Snippy snotty waiter. Didn't even have s chance to tell him it was my boyfriend's birthday. 

Food great. Timing of drinks & appetizers off & seriously the waiter acted like we should have been paying homage to him. Unfriendly & cold. Too bad. Could have been a perfect evening like we have had here In the past."}
{"text":"So disappointed. Another trendy Scottsdale restaurant with nice decor that's fails miserably in the quality food dept. cheap products were obvious. The \"Italian sausage\" on their cold platter prob sat in the fridge too long to be served. Had a grayish tint... Weird.. Have the chef sample the meat and cheese platter at Postino if they want a benchmark. Had a table of 10 for a bday party and everyone agreed that this is a have a drink only place after multiple meals failed to satisfy anyone. Went to dinner starving and left my mash potatoes untouched and ate half the prime rib sandwich. Honestly I think hey are just using cheap products, need a new distributor.  Always hate to complain because our waitress worked her butt off . left spending over $35 and still hungry."}
{"text":"WOW!! I am totally lost for word with this place everything was AMAZING! !! The food was fantastic,  the service was super! Our server Tony had great recommendations and had a great personality!  The kitchen staff was awesome treated each other very respectfully and all had positive attitude even when the pressure was on!!! We live about 45 minutes from here and we will be back for sure!!! My only regret is that I didn't have more room to try everything on the menu! !"}
{"text":"Great food and drinks although it gets extremely busy at happy hour.  

I was a bit disappointed to have made a reservation for my husband's and my anniversary dinner and be seated in the bar."}
{"text":"*****PORK-GASM!!!!! ****** (That's all I can say....dropping the microphone). 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place - and I can't believe how much my experience exceeded my expectations.  From the moment we walked in - the hostess (Lauren) was super nice & allowed us to sit anywhere in the restaurant.  We decided to sit outside.  It was cold, but we had several servers & I believe the manager or owner set up the outdoor heaters immediately.  Our server, Adam, knew the menu in and out and gave us great recommendations. The food...I'm not sure what to say except that its ridiculously delicious.  Just go and try it!
We'll be back tomorrow and probably at least once a week - I love this place. I'm so happy its right around the corner!
Everyone was so nice and helpful, including another server (Michael).  What a great  restaurant experience!  I'm looking forward to warmer weather and I hope will allow well behaved and super cute dogs on the patio  :)  Then I'll be there every day......"}
{"text":"We arrived at 5 on a Saturday night for Dinner and were seated on the patio.  We were having an enjoyable dinner when a private party arrived a virtually overtook the entire patio where we could no longer hear each other talk. At one point we had people we did not know making themselves comfortable at our table and being bumped by those standing on both sides of us, ruining the entire evening. The food was very good but suggest you sit inside or chance paying for having others barge in on your evenings"}
{"text":"Great Brunch! We have been in several times for dinner. Heard they now do a sunday brunch. It had a great array of food,and was all very fresh."}
{"text":"What's better than a Sunday brunch?! 
First let's start off with the Bloody Mary bar: three kinds of tomato juice, five types of stuffed olives, thick bacon strips, pickled everything lol including squash, asparagus, peppers, carrots, green beans, onions, and cucumbers, fifteen different hot sauces, horseradish and a few more things I can't remember........
The brunch buffet had smoked salmon, turkey breast and pork tenderloin. Sides including cheese grits, green bean casserole, sliced organic beets, fried green tomatoes, cranberry Cesar salad. Bakery goods including bagels, biscuits, pastries, cookies and brownies. They also had eggs and omelettes to order. 
There were more items that I didn't mention. The food was DELISH and flavorful. The interior decor was clean with a modern woody farm fresh look! There is a patio, but I didn't get to check it out. 
I highly recommend this place if you're looking for a casual and very yummy Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the Salty Sow in Austin and was super excited they had a location in Scottsdale! I re-tried a couple favorites and branched out a little bit. Deets below:

Truffle Deviled Eggs (5/5). At both locations, these are some of the best deviled eggs I've ever had. Creamy and light with the perfect truffle flavor. Highly recommend.

Duck Fat Fries (4/5). If you love French fries and aioli this dish is for you! The fries were perfectly seasoned and the portion was generous.

Pork Belly (5/5). Tender, pull-apart meat with killer sides. This entree kicks a**.

Fried Green Tomatoes (3/5). These were overly breaded and I didn't love the guacamole on top. I would skip next time.

Banana Foster Beignet (5/5). The banana ice cream is so delicious, it tastes homemade! The beignets are nice and crisp with fresh bananas inside. DELISH!"}
{"text":"As I'm sitting here eating my beef shoulder that taste like beef stew with a fried egg on it. I can't help but wonder how someone can charge $9.50 for three slices of a fried green tomatoes with guacamole, $16 for an Arby's sized French dip that is cold with a side of steak fries, and $19.50 for what is in my onion is sad attempt at a good beef dinner? 

I'm just lost on how a company can think that their food is really worth the highway robbery of a $80+ for two very small apps, two small sandwiches, and a medium bowl of salty beef shoulder? This place has decent food but is priced out like they are above the average contender.  SORRY guys... not so much.  

On a positive side note the waitress on this nice Thursday night was a good worker and Pleasant. She was rushed with extra tables at 930 (10pm close) She always had a smile on her face and was never frustrated. Thanks HOLLY!!! The rest of the staff not so much."}
{"text":"The first time I went here, the experience was a five star rating. The last two times that I visited, I was disappointed with some of the changes to their dishes. The food is by no means terrible, The service is very good. I really liked some of their craft cocktails. The problem for us is they took some of our favorite dishes off the menu, so now we don't have much of a reason to come back. The Candide pork belly was one of the most amazing dishes I've ever had, it was sweet crispy on the outside, juicy tender and flavorful on the inside, but now it's just like slow simmered pork stew. The food is presented nicely, I really like the atmosphere, but for the price which is not cheap, I feel like I'd rather save money and make similar dishes at home. I'd say give it a try because it might just be that we were used to one thing and now we don't like the new version but if you've never been there before you wouldn't have anything to compare it to and might like it just fine."}
{"text":"This place has great outdoor seating and southern comfort food. The pork belly was exceptional and reminded me of living in the south. Our server had good recommendations and was attentive. We can't wait to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"I would have given 4 stars for the positively ice cold A/C, the interesting and comfy decor and had I not eaten the food here. 
 I have been to Salty Sow to meet friends for cocktails and had a great time on a couple of occasions.  
 I had never eaten here before and thought I'd try. (what a bad idea)
Basically it lived up to all the expectations of a chain restaurant... 
Got the  fried chicken and duck fat fries and they were \"edible\" \"ok\".
I left feeling disappointed and wondering... Did my drink taste like soap a little bit?  
Sorry Sow"}
{"text":"Been here since 6. Wait was supposed to be 30 minutes, so we stayed. Had a drink at the bar, nice. Sat for 45 minutes. Finally got a table. We still haven't place an order nor met our waiter. It's 8:08. Never again."}
{"text":"Cute place! Nice happy hour offerings.. we tried their deviled eggs which both my friend and I found too salty, enjoyed the fried green tomatoes and the Brussels sprout leaves were amazingly good! We also tried the roast pork tacos and the fish tacos and they were decent. We would definitely come back and try some of the other items on the menu... our bellies were much too full for anything else!!"}
{"text":"It was pretty good. I got the burger. It had potential but it needed something more like a sauce or more cheese or something. It was a bit dry. The bun was good and the ingredients seemed fresh. I would come again but I wouldn't get the burger. My sister got got chicken sandwich. She said the chicken was slightly bland but the Cole slaw was good. Also she liked the Arnold Palmer."}
{"text":"Everything was incredible but I'll highlight my favorites. The smoked salmon with dill sauce and the butterscotch pudding alone make it worth a jaunt from the Phoenix airport. The Caesar salad was imaginative, thank you.  Even the roasted beets,  not only gorgeous but good (I'm not usually a fan of bets but prepared this way with goat cheese,  yes). You can hardly go wrong here. Came with bloggers for a conference,  met the chef even. Will find a way to go back."}
{"text":"Happy hour review: Awesome truffle fries! Just awful old fashioned and Moscow mule...... Try harder..."}
{"text":"Agree.  Disappointing meals for all 4 of us. The flavors were not as interesting as described in the menu."}
{"text":"First time at Salty Sow and I was not disappointed.  It's a beautiful space next to the now-defunct Tilted Kilt.  We were seated right away in accordance with our reservation.  We had fried green tomatoes and stuffed mushrooms as starters and both were excellent.  Lots of flavor and well seasoned.  For dinner, I had the trout -- their version of trout almondine -- and, again, it was delicious!  Tender piece of fish in a nice buttery sauce went beautifully with a glass of sauv blanc.  Our group also enjoyed the lamb burger and the short rib.  Both were a big hit.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The place is nicely decorated.  This location has changed hands several times . The restaurant was a little pricy . About 50 dollars a person . Good thing we went during restaurant week . The service was average . A little slow  because of the crowd . The food was tasty and we shared most of the dishes"}
{"text":"This has been our go-to neighborhood eatery for almost 2 years. It is one of the best restaurants, if not the best restaurant, for miles around. The ambiance is warm and lively, with a dynamic, feel-good vibe and good, live music on the weekends. The dishes are creative and tasty. And this isn't just trendy, creative, unhealthy fare... There is something for everyone. The happy hour is a good value. The clientele is upscale but not pretentious. The staff is friendly. The hostesses are absolute gems and as helpful as can be - especially in having to deal with high demand at peak times. The specialty drinks are creative. Several of the servers and bartenders are highly professional and helpful. Others... less so. I am stopping short of giving the Salty a 5 because, in our many times there, there have been some areas of improvement. These include the service not being as good as what we have come to expect, certain areas of the restaurant being too loud, too crowded or too hot, and the kitchen running out of signature dishes - sometimes even early on in the evening. Again, a few areas of improvement over our many visits. And mostly related to the high demand on this place. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Not to be missed! If you are a fan of unique, rich, scrumptious fare, this is your place! The food is excellent, and so is the service. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Always. Just sat down at the bar, couldn't get the bartender to acknowledge us, and 45 minute wait in the main area with dozens of open tables. We ended up getting up and leaving!"}
{"text":"Amazing find. Rivals any hip and upcoming place in Southern California. Had Maple Old Fashion that was stellar. Started with charcuterie platter which is the only way to go. Incredible variety for the money. Fries did not disappoint. Mushrooms were tiny and packed enormous flavor but honestly I could have eaten 3 dozen of the little guys. My guest said the burger was the best he had ever eaten - so there you go. Finished with fantastic bananas foster like I had never had. 

I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Excellent food, fabulous brew choices, service was ehhh okay. For some reason it takes a very long time to get a drink from the bar.. The menu is very creative and the atmosphere is wonderful.  Love the rustic touches. We will be back."}
{"text":"Ok. The best thing about this place was the uber-comfy booths and buttery leather seats. 

For real. 

I had been SO stoked about finally going and trying the things people on Yelp raved about - the duck fat fries, the truffled eggs - I was heartbroken as the reality of the mediocre, tiny pieces of food and indifferent service crashed upon me.

My boyfriend and I met after work yesterday and I arrived ahead of him. I ordered his iced tea from the guy who brought me my Rosemary's Piglet drink (Save yourself the 9 bucks, it was tasty at first but then the rosemary overtakes the drink and it's just bitter. Like I feel now, post meal.) and the guy forgot about it, so my BF came in ten minutes later and was already slightly annoyed because he had no tea. Then the guy suddenly remembered and I saw him tell our server and point to our table so SHE could get our tea. (The reason I had not asked her is because she was a sporadic visitor to the table...the servers were all gathered around at the kitchen/grill entrance socializing with their backs to all the tables. There were not that many people there at 5 PM on a Wednesday, so no excuse for late/poor service. Lots of servers, but also lots of apathy.)

Then she brought the iced tea, and we had to flag someone else down a few minutes later for sweetener. It was annoying. Just....bad service. unattentive as anything.

We ordered the truffled eggs and mushroom caps for an appetizer. My one star is for the caps. They were made with what was touted to be homemade chorizio and the chorizio was succulent and spicy, The mushrooms themselves were a little hard and small but the flavor of the chorizio stuffing redeemed them.  The truffled deviled eggs were TERRIBLE. Tasted nothing of truffle, they were mayonnaise-y and almost sweet. Yuck.

I then ventured on to the \"bacon and eggs\" which was porkbelly over \"Creamy, cheesy grits\". These were the first grits I ever had in a nice place that were actually GRITTY. Terrible. And the tiny strips of porkbelly were overcooked, dry, and just not good. The egg served with them I didn't even touch as the yolk was solid  and cold, not over easy and lovely.

My BF got the beef shoulder, which he did like, the 3 ounces that he got, anyway. I have to say, the portions are smaller here than you expect for the cost. And it wouldn't be so terrible if it all wasn't so BLAND.

The duck fat fries just tasted like re-heated, overly crispy then cold again french fries. Huge waste of time.

So we tried everything we wanted to, but in the end I feel like I paid $80 for a mediocre food and indifferent service.

Oh! One thing they are doing right there? The hostessing! And the hostesses! They did everything right - greeted us, told us they were glad we came when we left - they were awesome. And I have to say the manager walked around and asked if everything was ok - but at that point, I was hungry, annoyed, had to be somewhere after dinner and simply didn't feel like getting into it. If I thought they could have made it right, I would have said something. But the flaws are in the way the food was done, when it came down to it. It seems to be working for most people but then I wonder where these people giving Salty Sow four and five stars have been eating?????  

Local Bistro or Wally's American Grill - those are places in this genre that are doing it right. This place is all hype, in my opinion."}
{"text":"GET THE LAMB BURGER!

I've passed this restaurant several times and thought it looked interesting. My husband and I decided to try it out for lunch on a Saturday. The weather was pretty nice, so we chose to sit outside on the patio. The restaurant is situated in front of Walmart, but the patio was angled so that you wouldn't even know it.

We both ordered arnold palmer's which had fresh lemonade. I was having trouble deciding what to eat as the menu offered a lot of enticing entrees. I asked the waitress for recommendations, and she said she received lots of good feedback for the lamb burger. This was the best decision ever! If I could have married this burger I would, but sorry lamb burger I'm already taken. Why was it so good? Well, it was cooked perfectly at medium rare, with a garlic olive tapenade that complimented the meat, the creamy goat cheese topped it off to flavor greatness. 

Seriously! Get the lamb burger!

My husband had the open faced BLT, a sandwich with bacon, pork belly, fried green tomatoes and a fried egg on top. This was also fantastic, I liked mine better but this still did not disappoint. 

I can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu, but I'm not so sure if I will as I'm in love with that burger!"}
{"text":"Used to just love Salty Sow. Somehow, over the past year or so, the quality seems to have slipped. This is just my opinion but the Honey Rosemary Dipped Chicken I ordered last week was really sub-par. The chicken was overdone to the point of very dry and if there was a teaspoon of gravy in the bottom of the dish that might be being generous. This review pains me because I love the place. The loss of Mr Shaw doesn't help. Sorry, I might have to go less often."}
{"text":"We went to the Salty Sow for Mother's Day brunch buffet.  The service was outstanding and the choices in the buffet were outstanding!  We brought our little chihuahua and sat on the patio.  The patio was lovely.  I can't wait to go here again!"}
{"text":"So much delicious food and wonderful cocktails. I would love to just keep going back and trying everything on the menu. It did not seem like a place where you would order fish, but almost everyone in my party did, and they each raved about it. If I go back, I will suggest us all passing our plates so that we can try multiple things in one meal."}
{"text":"The deep fried Brussels sprouts are very good! Too bad they took the chicken tacos off the menu. When I asked why they said because they weren't serving the chicken during lunch in order to make the tacos later with. How about just make some fresh ones! LOL Margarita is good I wish they get some different wines on the menu."}
{"text":"Took my family here last night for the \"Phoenix Restaurant Week\" promotion. Not sure what to expect, we arrived about 20 minutes before our reservation but were seated almost immediately. Our server, Nate, was delightful and the three course fixed menu selections covered all the bases (pork, fish, beef). The chips and guac were enough to feed a small army, and we also indulged in the deviled eggs (YUM). The service was at a comfortable pace and we really enjoyed the lighthearted banter with our server (my dad insisted that one of the chefs was out of uniform because his \"ninja headband\" was a different color than the rest of the chefs. The bone-in tenderloin was melt-in-your mouth tender and complimented nicely by the red wine sauce. Desert was the perfect finish, Berry custard cake and chocolate truffle, both delicious. 
We'll be back."}
{"text":"OK.... we're back on top with the salty sow guys!  Kevin the manager messaged me to say that if we give them notice they will have the chef make us the salmon!  THATS CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite neighborhood place, and it is not even in my neighborhood. We drive a long ways to come here on a regular basis especially for the Sunday brunch which is amazing."}
{"text":"Really like the decor! Good service. Ambiance is ruined by the noise level. Literally feel like I was at a concert after sitting in this restaurant for a quick dinner. 

Now it's a restaurant so let's talk about the food: I should have chosen something different. I got the PY salad. It did not come with everything that it states in the menu.... no almonds, only arugula and no kale or baby spinach, very few dates and minimal point Reyes blue cheese, sweet onion dressing was very tasteless."}
{"text":"Restaurant week dinner number 4.

I met a fellow Yelper here for dinner - we decided to go early, to get at least one drink and an appetizer from the happy hour menu. So happy to learn happy hour is every day, and honored through the entire restaurant, not just the bar!

The Brussels sprouts appetizer is amazing - I will start experimenting to replicate this at home. Quick fried shaved sprouts, tossed in agave with golden raisins and pecorino. Simple, but phenomenal!

The bone marrow crusted in bacon and gruyere was incredible and so rich and perfect.

The duck fat fries couldn't have been any better - serving them with the egg is brilliant!

The farm salad looked great - I'll probably get that next time.

I was a bit disappointed in the rotisserie pork. Nothing wrong with it - but not as good as when I make pork shoulder or picnic roast.

I am looking forward to coming back - the happy hour menu has a nice selection of $5 plates - and the cocktails are well thought out and well executed."}
{"text":"Short version: good food, mediocre service, in a Walmart parking lot???

Not as short version: this place has a cool hip vibe on the inside that rivals restaurants in Scottsdale. It's a welcome change to this area but I can't get over the oddly placed location. It's located right next to a Walmart. That doesn't bother me so much as it worries me that they're not hitting the right demographic but that's the marketing person in me. I had some pork shoulder and it was tender and juicy. Had some baked potatoes and those were good too. 

I'd say its a little more on the expensive side but nothing unexpected for the atmosphere. Besides you can walk to Walmart and save money there!"}
{"text":"This place is always pretty solid, chef BJ really cares about quality food. its our go to place once a week.

You need to try their  Sunday brunch!"}
{"text":"Walking distance from my home/ Love this place!! Have taken a few friends here and they have all loved it. Great Pork Chops, Fish & Chips, Craft Beer,..great patio. Bartenders act like they're your buddy,..great service!!"}
{"text":"This place has grown on me.  I started going with my twin mom's group when it opened and I was not that impressed.  Then I have been going for happy hour a few times and I have been enjoying a few of their bites more and more.  The honey rosemary fried chicken is my weakness.  I also like their stuffed mushrooms.  Their moscow mule is very good and my go to drink.  I have had a few of their desserts and they were very tasty."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I went for my birthday and it was the perfect ending to a great day. (Hooray complimentary champagne toast!) My friend and I split an order of the duck fat fries - so delicious! Easily the best fries I've ever had. I got a Rosemary's Piglet to drink and the rosemary frozen into the ice cube was a nice touch and tasted great. The beef shoulder... oh my. Fantastic. The most flavourful carrots I've eaten in a long time, and the beef! Like buttah! I have yet to stop thinking about that beef. I would marry that sauce, too. I'll definitely be making the trip back here from Tempe as soon as I can because now I think I'm obsessed."}
{"text":"Pork belly was amazing!! I also enjoyed the cheese grits that came with it  and my Smoky Sow Martini. The pork wasn't too fatty. It had just the right amount to make it moist."}
{"text":"The Salty Sow has a great atmosphere but it's a bit over priced & not a very good value.  We ordered the charcuterie and cheese board, which was very good.  The service was very prompt.  However, I asked the waiter for a recommendation between one of two salads for my entree.  Based on his recommendation I chose the Trout Salad, which was good but was very small and was only half the size of the other salad for the same price.  Unfortunately this left me not feeling very satisfied, particularly since I spent $40 for two drinks, a small salad and an appetizer split 4 ways.  If I'm spending that much I shouldn't be leaving the restaurant hungry."}
{"text":"Loved, loved, loved this place. The service and live music were delightful, matched only by the excellent food. Great quality, inventive menu, creative drinks. We started with the duck fat fries with 110 minute eggs (oh, yeah!), crispy brussel sprout leaves, and chorizo stuffed mushrooms. So garlicy and good, I could have made a meal from those alone. We also had the lamb burger and bacon wrapped pork filet. Honestly, I could have just worked my way down the menu. They have a gluten-free menu and many great options for those following the Paleo diet. A word of caution, though, the butterscotch boudino and creme brulee (gluten-free but definitely NOT paleo) were worthy of the departure. Would love to come back for happy hour - that menu looked amazing, too."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. I had the French Dip and my husband had the Lamb burger. Others in our party ate off the Gluten Free menu and loved it. The staff was friendly. Our waitress however was not very good, not awful. If we got her again I'd say something. Overall yummy."}
{"text":"There's one sure-fire way to get me into a restaurant, and that is to serve a lamb burger.  On the red meat scale, lamb may not rate as highly as elk or venison, but it certainly beats out boring old beef.  Want a way to give your boring hamburgers a little bounce?  Make it out of lamb.

So, of course, I had to try this place out.

I arrived during the peak of the Saturday dinner rush (either that or this place is doing very, very well), and sat at the bar.  This gave me a perfect vantage point to view all the goings-on - the drink preparation, the hustle and bustle in a fast-moving kitchen, all the pomp and pretense of the well-to-do north Scottsdale crowd.  This is clearly the most happening evening spot in the immediate vicinity.

When my juicy, medium-rare lamb burger and duck fat fries arrived in front of me, I immediately transformed into a vulture.  I drooled over my plate, my sensibilities comprised of satisfaction laced with empathy for my fallen prey.  It would be impossible to portray the restraint it took to pace myself.  I wanted to savor it, but I could not wait for the next bite.

As the juices from the impeccably cooked ground lamb splashed upon my plate, adding an extra level to the flavor profile of my duck fat fries, I reflected on the handful of lamb burgers I had previously enjoyed.  This one was definitely one of the best, if not the very best.  It may even beat out that excellent lamb burger I had in Portland.

I will admit, I have only eaten at Salty Sow but once, and it may seem premature to declare a verdict on a place after one visit.  But one a place serves up such an excellent lamb burger, and there aren't any glaring problems with the dining experience, it deserves credit.  This place is worth a visit or five."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar, service was prompt, beer was cold and the food was tasty. The party shares three dishes, two were specials, one off the regular menu, all were very good!  Prime rib sandwich was amazin"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Great atmosphere. Great entertainment. Great food!  Duck fat fries are spectacular and the cocktails are outstanding. Fast service. This is my new fave place!"}
{"text":"The Salty Sow is a farm-to-table American Gastropub concept that started in Austin (got to meet one of the founders another time I was here).

They've got a really interesting menu!  Lots of cool, fun stuff to try.

This time, I got the chicken thighs.  They were quite tasty, but the roasted potatoes they were served with were outstanding.  (What?  Yeah...I don't know, but they were about the best roasted-small-potato dish I've ever had).  Duck fries were a nice starter (with the poached eggs to dip into).  

Sadly, nobody ordered dessert this visit, because they've got some great desserts!"}
{"text":"I had a fantastic time, the staff were wonderful, and the weekend happy hour is an added bonus! I arranged to have a small surprise dinner for my boyfriend and the staff was very helpful in allowing my friend to set up some silly decorations. I also love love love weekend happy hours since not everyone has a convenient Monday-Friday 9-5 job. We ended up ordering a combination of happy hour appetizers and main dishes and everything was delicious! I recommend the brussel leaves appetizer, the brussel sprout creaser salad dish (I added pork), and the chicken. The cocktails were also great. I loved my martini with stuffed olives. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Walking up to the cute lit up signs out front, hearing live music coming from the speakers, and into this beautiful open layout of a restaurant; I could tell that this was going to be a good date night. My husband and I sat at a cozy high-top booth in the bar area. We were greeted by our lovely waitress who walked us through a few of their fancy drinks and their specials for the night. We decided on the Smokey Sow Martini (Titos vodka, with bacon and cream cheese olives.) and The Petey (Eddy's Grapefruit Vodka , Mint, Orang, Agave, and Soda water.) Both were nice and strong. I would say the Smokey Sow was mostly a regular Dirty Martini for the most part but The Petey was pretty Unique and tasty. We also started off by ordering the Cheese Curd's with Jalapeno's and Sriacha Aioli off of nightly special and they were perfection! Light and fluffy with the perfect kick from the deep fried Jalapeno's. And with perfect timing our Entrees were delivered. After much thought we had finally decided to try the Rotisserie-Roasted Pork and the Asiago-Crusted Halibut. The Roasted Pork was tender on the inside and crispy on the outside, accompanied by a nice side of pinto beans, avocado and red onion salad, and a side of buttered tortillas. This meal was good but it was our least favorite of the 2. We fought over that last bites of the Asiago- Crusted Halibut. Halibut was seared to perfection with gold crusted outside and a fall apart inside, topped with this delicate, buttery, lemon sauce that we mopped up with every last bite. The Halibut came with a side of broccolini that was also perfectly seasoned and cooked. We could not have been more satisfied. But we decided to give the desert special for that night a try and boy was it good. Neither one of us had ever tried Butter Milk Pie before and we were not to sure what to expect. The crust was flakey and buttery with a sweet creamy kind of custard inside, topped with fresh barriers, whipped cream and what I think was home-made vanilla ice cream. It was the perfect way to end our meal. 

I was so in love with this place. It was a bit of a pricey night. But the food was perfection, the guy playing on his guitar and singing was amazing. I even got his card. Preston Phillip was his name. He played all kinds of songs from Sublime to Imagine Dragons, all with his own spin on them. The staff was super friendly and knowledgeable, I loved the open layout, the rustic modern décor and furniture. I can say that I don't mind spending the extra cash for a place, and a night out such as this one. I can't wait for my next date night here. We might have to try the Happy Hour next time and see what that is all about. I'm sure they won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Best food. Had the double cheese burger, we were with a large party so tried the fuck fat fries ( yummy), the fried green tomatoes, and bone marrow.. It was great food and good drinks .."}
{"text":"Delightful, delicious, and divine! This was the first stop my wife and I popped into on our weekend trip to Scottsdale. 

  As soon as we sat down the waitress tried to get us in for the tail end of happy hour which put a smile on my face immediately. My wife, our friend and I  ordered a couple signature cocktails a beef shoulder taco and some deviled eggs. The taco was tender, flavorful and surprisingly big! The only downer to this mouthwatering side was that there was only 1 of them for a $5 price tag, but it was very good and  astonishingly large. I am not a huge fan of deviled eggs but I'll always try something once and I was pleasantly surprised with the small bite i took. 

   Now for the main coarse. I ordered the pork chop, my wife went with the french dip and we both quenched our thirsts with a couple beers. No complaints on the french dip or the pork chop but when I wasn't really feeling my beer selection the waitress happily exchanged it for another. 

Overall my impression of Salty Sow was awesome! The service was above and beyond, with a promptness that impressed my whole party. The food was pretty good and the atmosphere was very comfortable. I would absolutely come back here and I highly recommend this gastro pub to anyone looking for some delicious cocktails and good eats."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The decor is great...not overdone, but comfortable.  The bartenders were amazing...so much personality and let us try a few things before making up our minds on drinks.  The happy hour specials are amazing...you don't want to miss it.  Next time, definitely trying some of the delicious sounding and looking food."}
{"text":"HAPPY HOUR REVIEW:

Imagine you had a long day. And you wanted to relax and indulge in something incredibly scrumptious, delectable, and sinfully good.  Well... Think Sow.  Salty Sow.

We were over near the PV Mall and we decided, spur of the moment, to get something nearby. We thought of sushi and a few other places. But then we saw the three golden neon arrows pointing to the front door of the Salty Sow. 

AMBIANCE/MOOD:
The Salty Sow has that nouveau feel to it. The bar is off to the left as you enter, with a large kitchen straight in front of you. You see a lot of wood and interesting lighting (photos). But the feeling is very intimate. Even with other diners nearby, you cannot hear their conversations. The clientele is mixture of millennials and older, with a dozen or so sitting at both the bar and the dinning area. 

MENU:
Like most places in the Valley, the Happy Hour menu is a jumping off point for the  Dinner menu. When you are seated you are given both menus. There seems to be no pressure to order off of one or the other. The focus of the food is all things pork. So if you love bacon, then you have found your Nirvana in this life. LOL

Almost all the items on the Happy Hour menu are $5,00 and you find things like: Triple Fried Duck Fat Fries, Truffled Deviled Eggs, Pork Belly Tacos and Braised Beef Tacos and much, much more

SERVICE:
Everything is relaxed and our server Holly was excellent.  Folks stop by and ask about your meal and dishes are bused quickly

FOOD:
Okay, the best thing we tried was the HH Fried Chicken that came with a honey glaze and a large sweet potato biscuit (photo).  Even here there was bacon on the underside of the chicken.  It was moist, flavorful and delicious!

We also order two tacos which were equally good that came with a fried egg on top (photo).  But you must try the Duck Fat Fries, which were seasoned with herbs and salt.  It also comes with a poached egg yoke on top (photo).  Great stuff.

PRICES:
Everything at Happy Hour is $5.00 and it ends at 6:30 with the ringing of a cow bell.  Ahh, \"we need more cow bells!\"  LOL  Our bill came to $37.50 before taxes and gratuities, including two items to go and a soft drink ($2.50).

Debbie Downer:
Just before the check, we asked our server if we could order two items to go.  We also asked what the up-charge would be.  To our surprise, she said it would be the same price.

As we were leaving, the Culinary Manager approached us and said: 
\"We normally don't allow people to order off the Happy Hour menu to go.\"  As I stamered to say we had checked first with our server, she said: \"I'm going to let it go this time, but don't do it again.\""}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I had family in town a few weeks ago and we went one night to check this place out and ended up going back a second time before their visit was over!
Everything we ate was amazing! But, I would highly recommend getting the Brussels as an appetizer! I would also suggest the pork belly. I had never tried pork belly before and decided to branch out and am very glad that I did. I honestly don't think I'll eat pork belly anywhere else in fear that it would just not compare. 
Service was amazing! Wonderful restaurant. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great service and great buffet lunch! Service was great and they even did a champagne toast for my dad's birthday"}
{"text":"It was a busy Friday night and we showed up without a reservation so we had to wait about 30 minutes for our party of 5 to be seated. There was no kids menu so my son ordered off the appetizer menu and was quite happy with his deviled eggs. I shared my truffle fries with him which everyone at the table loved. The food was good and I tried a few new things like marrow and blackened red fish. The cocktails were fantastic and highly recommended. My only complaint was the noise level, we spent a lot of time just staring at each other because the noise level was so high we could hear each other. Despite that I would still go back."}
{"text":"Completely torn in two directions with Salty Sow: food is awesome- service was terrible! We have been here before but last night will be the last time we eat here. The waitress, Brenda, came to take our drink order and then we didn't see the drinks or waitress for another 20 minutes. When the one bar drink we ordered arrived, it was delicious but Brenda never even brought out the soda that my sister had ordered. The whole time we were waiting to order we could see her on her phone by the kitchen texting! We finally gave our order to a different server! In hindsight- we should have just left when the drinks had taken 20 minutes to come out! Unfortunately I can't even give her the benefit of the restaurant being busy- they were pretty slow for a Friday night. 

TLDR: amazing food, find better servers because that horrible service just cost them some customers."}
{"text":"The crispy brussles sprouts leaves are fantastic! 
I tried them as they come on the menu and they were delicious. I decided to try them plain (sans raisins, cheese, & agave) & thought they might have been better this way.  I actually got full on this appetizer alone and while they were a wee bit oily, I still felt like I ate fairly healthy. 
We sat at the inside bar that opens up to the outside. On a 100+ degree day we still felt cool & comfy."}
{"text":"Overpriced mediocre food!  5 bucks for a taco on happy hour??  The portions are tiny.  They're all complex, but Michelin star worthy I think not!  They price themselves like they are though.  The food isn't that noteworthy either."}
{"text":"Great Sunday brunch. The range of food is spectacular. Of course there is a carving area- but not the traditional tough roast beef. They gave fabulous stuffed pork in addition to really good turkey. Their Mexican casseroles are heady, flavorful and stand up to that offered by classic Mexican restaurants. But me absolute Davonte is their warm salmon. This is a fabulous spin on traditional smoked salmon (aka lox) on many brunch buffets. Can't wait for more. And, on top of it all, they have a well stocked make your own Bloody Mary bar at $5 a glass. Have been 4 times and plan to keep returning"}
{"text":"First timers...My family and I had a great dining experience! Menu was bomb, different flare with bursting taste! Reasonable prices, great service,friendly atmosphere and Brenda our server was a doll!! Thanks Salty Sow...We appreciate you making our family night out a great one."}
{"text":"We were told they were closed 30 minutes before the restaurant was actually closed. We just wanted a drink and appetizer! Not only that, there were still plenty of customers in the restaurant. Not impressed with a restaurant that kicks you out when you want to spend money and there are clearly still people being served."}
{"text":"Location is great, theme is , ambiance is rustically modern, they have live music during dinner on the weekends, and the food is pretty darn tasty! Wide variety of dinner and drink options! Great date night spot. The only reason I didn't give 5 starts is the service is good but not great - if I ask a waiter what their favorite 3 dishes are, I expect some enthusiasm and branding of the restaurant. Got a measly, this is good that is good. Also never expect that I don't want dessert- let me tell you no thanks. Coulda sold me dessert but didn't ask me. Still food level is worth it!"}
{"text":"Happy hour here is the best!! The food is always prepared perfectly and with so many options. Sit on their patio where it's a little quieter and you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Ok this place is truly outstanding ! Third time in 2 weeks. Michael took wonderful care of us again. Everything we have tried has been wonderful. We are working our way through the menu and the drink menu too. If we had this place in Dallas  we would eat here once a week especially with waitstaff like Michael. Go try it and let Michael suggest  what to have , you won't be disappointed !"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience at the sow on a busy restaurant week Saturday. Live music was playing and some unique drinks were flowing (try the Moscow mule!). I went with the price fixed menu and enjoyed the Brussels sprouts salad as well as a very tasty and large portion of the pork belly. Outstanding! I had to try the already famous duck fat fries with the 110 minute egg and wasn't disappointed. The egg was an experience and clearly this is a dish not to be missed; especially if you like French fries. A nice dessert selection including a fresh fruit plate rounded off a very pleasant experience. Considering the PV mall location, The Salty Sow is a great find and I'll be back soon enough."}
{"text":"I love this place, have for years. Ate many dinners there, good atmosphere, creative, fresh, decent portions. Great craft cocktails, good pour (whiskey anyhow). The best chocolate flourless mousse dessert, always satisfies my chocolate craving. 
Went for lunch recently, had salmon (I'm more of a meat eater), that plate didn't disappoint. 
Would highly recommend, I hear there's a happy hour as well. Give it a whirl."}
{"text":"Stellar beers, service, appetizers and food! Definitely New American with quality fresh flavors. The Brussels Sprouts chips, chicken liver pate and pork chops were the bomb! We've also enjoyed other dinners and never received anything but delectable eats!"}
{"text":"We arrived just at the end of a Happy Hour. We ordered the most delicious eggplant frites for $5. We also  got our Blanche and Blanche Royal margaritas for Happy hour prices. Our waitress Krista got our orders for drinks and appetizers. For dinner, I ordered the beef taco with a fried egg : absolutely delicious !! My husband ordered the rib eye which was also tender and delicious. We ordered the banana foster with beignets- outstanding. The manager-Kevin Bird allowed me to sit on a bar stool and watch the cooks at their craft-amazing !!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best restaurants I've ever been to!  The bar staff is the best!  They are so passionate about what they do and so engaging.  Sven was great at selecting a great beverage and appetizer. Angela had a great smile and was genuine about her conversation.  Overall the food was amazing and drinks did their thing, but the staff knocked it out of the park.  Definitely will be coming in again soon.  Well done guys!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I can't tell you how many times we've been to Salty Sow. I've lost count. Always good. Small portions but fair priced so it's good to get an appetizer and maybe even a side but that's coming from a big eater. Service is Awesome!"}
{"text":"It has taken my wife and I far too long to try this place.  We went last Friday for happy hour / dinner, and let me tell you, this place is a welcome addition to the immediate area which is otherwise pretty depressing food-wise.  In a sea of chains this place stands out and serves up some great food and drinks.

We arrived shortly after 5pm on a Friday and the place was beginning to fill up.  The entire patio was somehow reserved so maybe they were expecting a big party or 25 people really did call ahead to get a spot.  Either way, get there early if its a nice evening and you want to sit outside or get a spot at the bar.  Anyway, we took a seat at the bar and ordered some drinks and appetizers.....

Smoky Sow Martini - Very good.  Solid pour.  I especially enjoyed the cream cheese and bacon stuffed olives

Crispy Brussels Sprout Leaves = Excellent.  A highlight among the appetizers we ordered.

Pork Belly Taco = Very good but the flavor was overpowered by the egg yolk in my opinion

Eggplant Frites = Very good.  Very unique.  It almost seemed like I was stuffing something healthy in my face.

Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms = Ok.  They did have a kick though.



I hope to return soon to sample more of their apps, salads, and main dishes."}
{"text":"Sow good!! I came here with two girlfriends for happy hour.  Love the setting and vibe of this restaurant.  Great prices for food and drinks during happy hour.  I ended ordering something off the regular menu and a happy hour item too.  I was hungry!! This place did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Great happy hour!!!! Special prices on yummies like crispy Brussels sprouts, delicious chips, guac, and salsa, and lots of drink choices. I had a nice and well seasoned prime rib with a small salad and mashed potatoes. Perfect. Hubby had a spicy chile stew that was heavy on the cumin, which I like! Took home a chocolate cake for breakfast. A bit pricy for a weekly trip, but well worth it for happy hour or an early dinner, or a special occasion. Our bill was $90.00 including tip."}
{"text":"I have eaten here about 5 times. The food is good but the service is quite frustrating. It starts off great and then the service goes downhill. Refills for drinks are impossible and when they deliver the food it is impossible to ask for a condiment because the server just disappears. Once they up-sale cocktails and appetizers, the friendly service is gone. The last 3 times we could not get out in under 2 1/2 hours and never got a refill for the non-alcoholic drinks and waited over half hour for the check. We finally had to trap a different server to PLEASE find our server to get our check. Frustrating. I've stopped going and when asked I have suggested another restaurant where my business is valued. I feel that 5 visits is enough.  By the way I always tip over 20%, was a server, and genuinely never complain about service unless it's warranted. Service has to be good start to finish, not up until the order is taken."}
{"text":"Don't let the menu or the name of the restaurant fool you, the SALTY SOW is OFF THE HOOK!!!!!! Comfort food at it's best! I suggest ordering a few dishes and sharing, it's that good. The pork ragu with polenta is AMAZING!!! So are the tacos and the french fries. I can go on and on and on!!!!!

I don't suggest bringing your little kids here, especially if they are picky eaters. I do suggest coming here for a date with your better half. Live music on the patio as well.

AWESOME! AWESOME AWESOME!"}
{"text":"This may end up in my fave restaurants list. A group of us went here for our little dinner club one night. It's a cute, farmhouse feel with a cool bar and open kitchen and I'm not gonna lie, we chose this because I love the name : Salty Sow. It's different and almost comfort food amped up. As in, the pig has style, so make her fancy for the night. That's what I love. The chef twists a simple pork shoulder and makes it a little more fancied and decks it out in a little cast iron pot. We had sangria, margaritas,  a old fashioned and wine with dinner. Our apps were the deviled eggs and fritters. We know how to represent the piggy kingdom! My mom had the halibut and it was divine. We ordered the biscuits, as well. No one left hungry or dissatisfied; in fact we all loved it. Our waiter was sweet, attentive and knew his drinks and menu very well. I have some food allergies and he made sure to explain how it could be, well, fixed to this swines seemingly picky ways. We shared the bananas foster beignets.. A must but a 'must share' because they are sweet and rich. Oink. Oink."}
{"text":"Extremely tasty pork! Tender and flavorful dishes. Don't come here if you're on a diet. The food is too good not to lick the plate clean. As a starter I recommend the duck fat fries. From there you can't go wrong with any of the pork dishes. Mood lighting and a nice big bar area and pork and fries. It's a great place to eat some tasty food and socialize."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere here, it's got a nice big bar and tvs, but plenty of seating in quieter areas. I Really liked the Brussels sprouts  side dish. My burger wasn't quite what I hoped for, very fatty, but everything else was wonderful, and I'd try another dish next time."}
{"text":"I've worked in restaurants for many years. Never in my life, have I had such terrible attitude from a server.  I had a few questions regarding the menu and got the rudest response from this server and incredibly condescending. I couldn't not believe it. I was so taken back, I asked for a minute to review the menu and left. 
 I sincerely hope this server is not an accurate representation of the entire staff, but my experience was upsetting enough to write this review."}
{"text":"Wow!! 
Food: French Dip was the best I've ever had and  Brussels sprout salad was superb (sweet & spicy). My husband got the double cheese burger and fries which he didn't put down....not even when I forced him to give me a bite! 
Cocktails: curly tail margarita and mule were noticeably hand crafted and fresh! Jalapeño pieces infused in the ice! 
Service: excellent!
Ambience: from the outside appeal to the inside it was so cute! I wanted to take snapchats of  everything lol AND my favorite part was the live music on the patio! 
I can't say one bad thing about this place!"}
{"text":"Our experience here started with a server dumping the stuffed mushroom appetizer all over my husband. Well, accidents happen ... and we were willing to move on. However, not once did the manager come over to check on my husband. His leg had been burned and his clothes ruined. But no, no one checked on us. 

Then his burger came out well done (when he ordered it rare). Additionally my pork taco came out with an under cooked (raw!) egg on it. 

At that point, I asked to speak to the manager who really could not have been more condescending. We actually had to convince her that the server spilled the food on us and that we didn't do it!  The servers actually both told her they were responsible!  Questioning the guest is not the way to instill confidence in us coming back!  

We used to love this place and even introduced friends to it. But not any more. What a complete disappointment."}
{"text":"I freaking love this place! The ambiance is great, they have good live music and it is prefect for date night.The menu and drink list are fantastic, I haven't had a bad meal yet."}
{"text":"This is an update, and I must say it was a great time here last night. My dad had been wanting to check this place out, and since I've been once and liked the food but thought it was crammed  for my liking, we instead went on a week day at an earlier time and it was great.

The happy hour was good, we got an order of the deviled eggs, Brussel sprouts, and the duck fat fries. I do agree that I don't taste that much of a difference in the duck fat fries, but they are tasty. the Brussel sprouts are great as always and the deviled eggs were a nice balance. I don't like anything that is over truffle-y if you know what I mean?? 

Also, I had the elderflower liquor spiked white sangria, and if you like elderflower, you'll like it! My dad was so-so about it but I enjoyed it (mostly because it makes me think about elderflower soda in the UK.... Ahhhh. The memories) 

I was interested in more Brussel sprouts so I opted for the the sprout salad with chicken. My brother actually stole the show with his French dip sandwich, that thing was huge! My dad ordered the 12 oz prime rib and had no complaints.

Service was great, and super fast

We'll be back! (I prefer weekdays for sure at this place)"}
{"text":"This place is perfect if you want to take someone out and show them some cuisine that's bound to impress. I work in the area and heard it was new, open for dinner only and wanted to try it out, so I took my boyfriend here for a date night and immediately when I walked in, the atmosphere was so relaxing, yet intriguing. It almost felt intimate. The place used to be a gross ass China Buffet and it's completely flipped into a superior dining atmosphere. As soon as I walked in, the hostesses were extremely kind and professional.

Amy was our server and she was very, very helpful and knew the menu very well. Anything she was unsure of that we asked about, she made sure to find us the correct answer. She helped us out with the menu and we started out with the Charcuterie board (thankfully she helped us to correctly pronounce it). I've had meat and cheese boards before (I'm a huge Postino's fan), but this board was it's own kind. They various meats and cheeses were laid out and listed on the menu and most of it was all made in-house. Extremely impressive. My only critique to this dish was that the bread was a little too thick and toasted for my spreading preference, but everything on that board was devoured. Half the items I never tried, so I felt like the Sow educated me a little and helped me to explore my pallet.

I've never seen a menu like this before and I'm told that it's always changing. I'd highly recommend this place to my friends that have more sophisticated and open minded pallets than myself. I ordered the chili rubbed tuna. The fish was perfectly seasoned and seared and I couldn't help but get a shred of the roasted tomato in every bite of the green chile grits. You could taste the chile rub on the tuna in every bite. The combination was something I'd never think of. My boyfriend got the blackened red fish and I can't speak for him, but his plate was completely cleaned. 

Overall, the place was stellar! We loved our server, Amy, and we'll be going back again sometime to check out their Chef's menu tasting for only $25. What a great experience in such a wonderful location! Highly recommend this place if you're open to trying new things!"}
{"text":"I can't recommend the Salty Sow enough. We've eaten here 6 times now, and have had a great experience each time. The staff is amazing and the food is always on point. 

The happy hour menu is great. Their chicken liver mousse is absolutely amazing, and their gnocchi is the best I've ever tasted. I have never had a dish that hasn't been seasoned and cooked to almost perfection. 

As a former executive chef I highly enjoy watching the open kitchen. The chefs are quick and clean. And each dish they prepare is seasoned and plated with a high pride that I wish other restaurants would learn from. 

You can't go wrong here. You will enjoy it every time. High end enough for a fancy date or business meeting. Yet, layer back enough for a group of friends to sit around and laugh for a few hours. The staff is nothing but cheerful and very personable. 

Hands down my favorite place to relax and eat."}
{"text":"The service here is horrible and as far as I'm concerned they are a horrible place for groups thank god for Sven at the bar he's an amazing waiter/bartender I don't know if I'll ever come back the blonde at the hostess desk is awful as well I saw her grab a hostess and yank her to basically yell at her and the beer sucks craft beer more like crap beer the need actual beer on their menu"}
{"text":"Went here with a group for the 2014 Fall Arizona Restaurant Week. I started with the Sangria - which was unique and delicious. The I had the Louisiana Boudin Fritters, the Idaho Rainbow Trout with an awesome sauce, and the Butterscotch Budino with Salted Caramel for desert. Everything was amazingly good!"}
{"text":"Rainbow trout was well played on the plate and the table service was fantastic- try the darn trout y'all - you won't be disappointed!

Clean spot inside and out with good layout and setting"}
{"text":"Some of the best food in town!  Everything is amazing.  The staff is friendly and knowledgeable.  The menu is diverse and the decor is rustic and fun.  It's a great atmosphere. We've taken all our friends and love this place.  So happy they are open for lunch and Sunday brunch!"}
{"text":"The Salty Sow has a lot of reviews.  I don't know what I could say that hasn't already been said... but here goes nothin'.

I love love LOVED the décor and ambiance.  An open kitchen gets me every time.  We sat at a long butcher-block type table.  I'm from Chicago, and it reminded me of Girl & the Goat and Publican, with the big pictures of pigs on the walls and rustic décor.

The menu was fantastic.  Happy Hours abound in the Phoenix area, apparently, because we were able to once again score half priced appetizers and deals on drinks.

Beverages were delicious - I have somewhat of an obsession with Moscow Mule's - Salty Sow has their own take on it which was absolutely fantastic.

We had a large group and I'm unsure of what everyone ordered, but I can tell you what the BF and I got:

:: Truffled Deviled Eggs with Salty Sow bacon.  Savory but not too heavy.  Perfect combination of flavors, and on the happy hour menu!
::Roasted Organic Beets salad.  Whipped goat cheese, pistachio vinaigrette.  This was heavenly.  The goat cheese and pistachios paired perfectly with red and golden beets.
:: Bacon & Eggs.  Candied pork belly, stone-ground white corn cheese grits, fried egg, whol-grain mustard jus.  This was my dish.  The only thing that I didn't LOVE about it was the jus.  However, once I broke the yolk on the egg and married everything together, it was perfect.
:: Bacon-Wrapped Pork Filet Mignon.  Sweet potato mash, apple mustard chutney, chipotle honey sauce.  His dish.  Too smoky for me in flavor, but he devoured it.

All in all, a great dinner to celebrate our friend's birthday in Phoenix.  I would absolutely return if I'm in Austin or Phoenix."}
{"text":"Don't let the unique menu items turn you off from eating at the Salty Sow. Must have appetizers include the bone marrow and fried green tomatoes. Like everyone else says, the duck fat fries are delicous.

Very good at accommodating both small and larger parties. Fast service and polite employees too. Will be back again!!"}
{"text":"The food was incredible! Super high quality and amazing flavors. Best meal I've had in a while. Also had wonderful, friendly service."}
{"text":"Tried this place the other night with a fellow Yelper! It's good to know that we have Chef Marmulstein in the area since he will be featured at the James Beard House.

Great atmosphere and ambiance at Salty Sow. Tried the crispy Brussels sprout leaves as a starter and that was great. Really enjoyed the crispy twist with the Brussels. Was a little upset since my first choice for dinner, rotisserie-roasted pork had just ran out. So my second option was the Asiago-Crusted Halibut, it was superb. My friend had the slow-cooked beef shoulder which came in a black iron pot.

All in all I enjoyed this place. Ordered the chocolate mouse truffle for dessert and YUM!"}
{"text":"Are you craving something to bring you back after a long week at work?  Maybe some rosemary fried chicken?  Duck fat fries with a side of bearnaise? Or something simple like friend green tomatoes and a side of guac?  Then this is your place.  Salty So is an absolute killer, easily one of strongest choices for a great drink and a fantastic meal.  
  For your first visit I highly suggest sampling their appetizers.  Beyond the aforementioned items, small bites like the pork belly tacos, deviled eggs, or even the brussel sprouts are worthy of creating a full meal. On those alone you can get an idea of their flavors and not break the bank.  Although their are some \"healthier\" options the selections will lean more towards the heavy side, so if you're on a diet, you've been warned.  Adult beverage wise they serve a take on most of the old standards; old fashioned, margaritas, mules, etc.  
The atmosphere is just your standard dimlit, casual vibed restaurant with an open kitchen. Nothing too exciting, unless you notice the giant slab of prime rib being sliced up near the service area, that caught my fancy.
All in all if you're looking for good eats with a southern twist, check out Salty Sow."}
{"text":"My Mom and I, hit up this place for a girls lunch. We loved the atmosphere. We sat on the patio and the traffic from Cactus was not an issue at all. We split the prime rib sandwich and the Caesar salad. Both were very good. Service was spot on as well. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We have been here several times. Last night Michael our server was wonderful! Service in the past had always been wonderful! Tonight we came again and sat at the bar. Bartender left allot to be desired. Copped an attitude from the beginning when she poured my husband a pini cocktail in stead of a Pinot Noir
Will come again because the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"Had the buffet and everything was fresh and very tasty! Smoked bacon was so good and their pork belly hash was delicious! Love the beets as well as the green chili pork! Service was also good!"}
{"text":"I really wish their menu was bigger but I do enjoy the ambience and quality of the food. Jenna was great.. I feel badly because we were her last table and I know how annoying that is but she didn't seem bothered!"}
{"text":"a delicious dinning retreat.  great wines, bartenders are attentive and the foods are fabulous!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch, food and good service. Lots of your favorite brick items in a well put together buffet style. Fun bloody bar. Something for everyone. Would definitely go back and eat off the menu."}
{"text":"I been there on the first day when they open and it's look like nothing change 
Nice time and AWSOME team 
They are the real Arizona place 
Nice outside place and cool inside 
Working fast on time organized and clean 
They food is ok ++ wouldn't say amazing but good American food 
I would go there in the day time 
Night time is not that good because it's not a real bar and not a real restaurant for evening 
But go it this you will Ike it"}
{"text":"I love this place. Happy hour on the patio is amazing. The music is always great, and the decor almost makes you forget you are pretty much in a Walmart parking lot. The food is great, and there are vegetarian options which is great. The staff is always very friendly."}
{"text":"My husband and I just love salty sow! We love the unique menu and atmosphere. We tend to make this a monthly visit"}
{"text":"Total disappointment. I took my parents here while they were in town visiting and we were looking forward to a nice meal. Our hopes were not fulfilled. Our server was friendly but acted like she was in a frazzled rush from start to finish.

I ordered the halibut which tasted good, but gave me a horrible stomach ache soon after finishing dinner. My mother and I split a salad. I am a vegetarian and she is not, so I asked for meat on the side. My second bite had bacon in it. So because of the kitchen/waitress's mistake, I just unintentionally ate meat. When I told the waitress this, she immediately removed my plate but didn't seem overly apologetic. 

Overall, the meal was expensive, the service disappointing, and I will never return to a restaurant that cannot accommodate a vegetarian."}
{"text":"Best drink ever here. Rosemary's Piglet is a force to be reckoned with. It's so good I drink 10 in a row. And that taco with the egg. Forget about it. Now they are open for lunch and their French Dip is to die. Service is always excellent too!"}
{"text":"Our server Shawn Kelly was so sweet and very knowledgeable about the menu and their amazing chef. This is our 2nd time in one week. Wish we didn't have to fly home tomorrow!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and the quality of the food and cocktails are on point.  I could go into every dish that I've had but I won't.  Just go.  You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Well, my love affair has sadly ended.  Sorry for the delay on this update.  We went back about a month ago, and just had such a disappointing experience.   The wait staff, as always, was excellent- so I'll still rave about that.  But the food?  It just wasn't as mouth-wateringly delicious as it was before.  And to be truthful, it was actually not good.  Not good at all.    I ordered my Pork Ragout again (I had seriously had dreams about this dish since our last visit).  It was very salty.  Like, horribly salty.  My wife ordered the beef shoulder everyone raved about and couldn't even eat one bite without gagging.   Not sure if the regular chef was out sick, or what the heck happened.... but it was bad enough, that I don't think we'll be returning.  Sorry Salty Sow- but we're better off as friends."}
{"text":"Went for appetizers again. Samantha waited on us and did a great job. She loved the trout appetizer and catfish taco. I tried carnitas taco. Very disappointing. Overcooked, dry and chewy. Still a fan. Just won't order that."}
{"text":"This is a great place.  You can get things here like nowhere else in the valley.  Service is great, the food is consistent, bartenders on point, and the decor is amazing.  So far, I've liked everything I've tried.  But the standouts were the truffle deviled eggs, green eggs and ham, bananas foster beignets, and Brussels sprout Caesar

I'd like to see their version of my favorites lunches; like grilled cheese sandwiches, avocado and chicken club, hot wings, and I guess a beef burger on the dinner menu since I don't really care for lamb burgers. Lastly, that Brussels sprouts Caesar deserves to be on a chicken breast sandwich or even a burger.  It's freaking amazing!  I'll be back for sure to see what their chefs come up with next.

I am deducting 1-star for not having a burger.  Do they deserve that... maybe not, but Ill give it back when they give in to my food extortion!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, great atmosphere, excellent staff. I recommend the brussel sprouts as an appetizer and beef shoulder as entrée. Somehow they made the sprouts taste like kettle corn (yum!) and the beef shoulder is cooked to perfection. There is an indoor/outdoor patio atmosphere which is even better when they have live music playing. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place but the 3 women (French Canadian) were not happy with their salads. Ill agree that the presentation was poorly conceived being on a bowl instead of a plate. Way more salad then necessary and scarce dressing.  

I had the french dip and it was glorious. Probably the best I have ever had. The french fries (pommes frites) that came with were very fresh and nicely seasoned. All and all I would return and perhaps try another dish but I would certainly take out another french dip."}
{"text":"The location is convenient for me but I think they're so proud of their duck fat that everything that I eat makes my fingers shine.

I stopped after work for a cocktail with a friend. Our service was really mediocre. They were busy but it took too long to get a drink and then we were left for quite a while. We ordered brussel sprouts and again, my fingers got pretty shiny. ugh. Other than that, nothing really stood out at all.

Parking is pretty easy and they seem busy so I may be alone in my opinions."}
{"text":"Always a great time. I have never been disappointed. Crispy chicken thighs are hard to beat. The lady loves the street tacos. The brunch on Sundays is out of this world. If we don't eat here 3-4 times a month, I feel like I am missing something."}
{"text":"The hamburgers are tasty and juicy. The egg on the fries doesn't have a liquidity inside. Everything overall is great."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food and drinks. The best sangria I have ever had. However the service is a hit or miss depending if you go on a week day versus the weekend."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood gastropub. Nice patio dinning all year round. Holly is a very attentive and pleasant server."}
{"text":"I had the most amazing Easter Sunday brunch at the Salty Sow!   They really put out quite a spread, but my favorite thing was the Bloody Mary bar!    Who knew there were so many types of mixings for Bloody Marys?  There are and I know about it now!

My favorite items on the all you can eat brunch buffet were the bacon and the chicken and waffles.  I adored the green chili stew and the smoked turkey, too!   

The service was friendly and the restaurant was trendy, cool, and clean.  We sat outside on the DOG FRIENDLY patio, which we all just loved.  

I would highly recommend and we will certainly go again soon."}
{"text":"Sunday, Father's Day was our 3rd trip to the Sow! Great atmosphere, service and food. We shared the fried chicken app which was very tasty. My wife had the charcuterie, which we couldn't finish and I had the collared greens (the best I've ever had) Our son had the boneless chicken thighs, very tender and moist and his wife had the price fixed tasty menu which was outstanding!
H/H is everyday, 4:30-6:30 $5 wines even on Father's Day.
Count on us to be back several times."}
{"text":"I took my dad here for Father's Day after discovering their happy hour on the Whistl app for iPhone. What a great find!

We started with a couple drinks. My dad got one of their local craft brews ($4) which he enjoyed very much. I was a little more adventurous and tried the Maple Old Fashioned ($6). It was excellent. It wasn't too sweet, and the maple added a nice subtle flavor that complimented this iconic drink very well. The single massive ice cube was a nice touch, allowing me to sip it through the meal without having to worry about it being watered down. 

We got a couple happy hour items along with the drinks. We tried the Spit Roasted Suckling Pig Taco with sweet onion slaw, pickled onions, smoked tomato salsa,
and cilantro aioli. It was huge! One could almost be a meal in itself. It was delicious. Definitely one of the best tacos I've ever had. The toppings really added to the savory flavor of the pork. We also had the  Honey Rosemary Dipped Fried Chicken a with Cat Head sweet potato biscuit, as recommended by our wonderful waitress. It came with a couple massive pieces of fried chicken bathing in a thick, delicious gravy.  The chicken was very juicy, and not greasy at all. We would definitely get this again.

For dinner, my dad got the Crispy Skin Salmon with lentils, thin beans, red wine sauce, and i asked the waitress what their best swine was. She recommended the 
Milk-Braised Pork Shoulder with white beans, escarole and Pecorino. My dad really enjoyed the salmon. It was pretty much what you'd expect from a nice piece of salmon, mild in flavor, very fresh, nice natural color. The pork shoulder was also really good. It sat in a sauce with the beans, escarole and Pecorino, letting me take a bite with each of the other things. The meat was very succulent, and paired my old fashioned quite nicely.

We will definitely be coming back to this restaurant very soon. If you're a foodie like me and always looking for a great place with food at a great price, definitely check out the Whistl app for Phone!

Happy Eatings"}
{"text":"So, my wife has a class today and informs me that I am in charge of dinner. It is too hot to grill outside, so I asked if I could take her to a nice restaurant? Her eyes popped and said she had heard of a new one in the valley called the Salty Sow. We did a little checking (Yelp) and I was in. Just to make sure we made a reservation on line.

Generally, I don't get too excited about a restaurant, but I have to tell you, we had a great experience. From the time we walked through the door to time we left with a smile on our face we were treated like old friends. Tony, our waiter, was attentive and helpful. Our table was cleaned twice while we were there, and I am not a messy eater. 

We started with the \"Crispy Brussels Sprout Leaves\". Wonderfully unique and very tasty. I had the \"Beef Shoulder Slow-Cooked\". It was melt-in-your mouth tender. They gave me a knife, but I think I only used it once. The beef was served on \"Smashed Potatoes\" and veggies and then topped with a fried egg. So good!

My wife had the Halibut. She took one bite and immediate wanted to give me a taste. I feel a little bad, I did not make the same offer. The fish seasoned in a way I had never experienced. It was exceptional.

We shared a butterscotch/caramel desert. A perfect end to our meal. We will be returning to the Salty Sow. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"This was such a great night. I took my boyfriend for his birthday, since we had never been. From the moment we arrived, it was all smiles. 
Ordered the charcuterie platter. One word: outdtanding!  Excellent variety and our server watched to make sure we had enough fresh grilled bread.
My companion ordered the beef shoulder, and I ordered the prime rib (beef whore, don't judge me). Both were amazing. Shoulder was so tender, and had great carrots and potatoes, while my prime was like butter. We finished off with a very sweet complimentary champagne toast and shared creme brulee. 
Will absolutely go here again. Snaps to everyone from the front to the back."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants. The atmosphere is laid back, the food is delicious and the customer service is fantastic. I ordered the braised pork shoulder over mash potatoes with an egg on top, it was simply to die for. Tasty, tender, delicious! To top it off was one of my favorite Four Peaks bears, the Kilt Lifter!  There happy hour looks fantastic, think I will try that next."}
{"text":"Love this place love the bartenders the servers the drinks the food. The lamb burger is bomb. The poutine  when they have it even gets a thumbs up from my fiancé who's Canadian. Drinks are amazing. Doesn't break the bank much either. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Dinner was excellent! Chorizo mushrooms were porky escargot. Lamb ragout was crazy good and the Fried Green Tomatoes were saved by the Guacamole. Maple Manhattan was inspired. 
Sean, you were great out of the gate but got distracted later and that lost a star. 
We will be back though. 
For those that know and love Campo in Reno, this is their Phoenix twin minus the pizza oven."}
{"text":"I love this place for happy hour. The atmosphere is unique and the menu is very different from other restaurants. The staff is also very attentive."}
{"text":"Great food, fun atmosphere and fun menu. I am sad that I have waited so long to try it!"}
{"text":"Great food.... servers are as little snooty... but ignore that and enjoy.... food is good. Excellent wine choices"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. I have been here so many times now . I happy to say I  am always please to bring family and friends here.  the service is perfect , they are helpful , kind and very thorough .  For my mother's birthday they were so very gracious and generous for her treat. Very impressive.    
The food is so tasty. Some of my personal favorites are the truffle eggs and the lamb burger. 
I can't say there is anything I have eaten here that wasn't completely delicious with generous portions ."}
{"text":"I really want to give this place 3.5 stars because that's what it deserves, but I'll bump it up to 4 stars.  I have been here many, many times over the last 6 weeks and I think I have a good sense of this place.  First all, I have never had a bad server here.  Not once.  I don't know how that's possible, but it's true.  They are always very warm and attentive.  They are around when you need them and leave you alone when you need to carry on a conversation.  A few of them have made some poor menu suggestions, but taste in food is sometimes subjective, so you can't hold that against them.

The decor is really fun!  Modern, but comfortable and definitely not Scottsdale.  The music selection drives me crazy though.  There is never any theme.  One night I'm listening to great oldies and then I'm listening to hair bands from the 80s, and yet another night I'm listening to grunge from the 90s. Pick a theme, or genre, and stick with it.

The food is either very good or very bad (kind of like that old nursery rhyme: \"When she was good, She was very very good, But when she was bad she was horrid!\") Every single taco I have ever had here has been completely inedible, if only because the meat is completely dried out.  I was really bummed too, because they put a yummy fried egg on top, which adds a twist to it.  So, avoid the happy hour tacos.  The crispy brussel sprouts dish should be removed from the menu.  They finely chop the brussel sprouts into confetti and fry them.  The fried bits dissolve in your mouth in a weird way and all you can taste is the oil.  Every once in awhile, you get a big chunk of brussel sprout that wasn't cut into a small bit and ends up frying for a very short period of time (making it raw, hard, and taste like brussel sprouts, which is not a good thing).  All I can say is avoid it; no modification can fix what's wrong with that dish. The deviled eggs are done completely wrong, in my opinion.  Some people love to have tons of yellow egg filling for their deviled eggs.  Others are minimalists.  I'm a proportionalist.  I don't want there to be so much filling that the damn egg tips over (and they do).  I took half the egg off of each and spread it on toast, which was actually pretty good.  Do not get the tasting menu!  At $25, you would think it would be a great deal, but it's only worth $15.  Each \"course\" (that's being generous) is literally only two bites (delicious bites).  I still had to order a meal after I paid all that money for Costco size samples.  I absolutely love the Rosemary's Piglet.  It's a cocktail with pomegranate juice, rosemary syrup, and champagne.  it's heaven!  HOWEVER, they put a HUGE (size of your fist) ice cube with rosemary leaves in the drink, which only allows for a tiny bit of alcohol.  If you order any drink here, make sure you ask for no ice cubes.  The ice cube wastes precious space and is actually big enough to assault your nose or eye.

Moving on, the food that is good is a long list!  The fried chicken is out of this world (the sweet potato biscuit that comes with the fried chicken has been mostly good, but there have been times when it came out hard as a rock--if they made it smaller, this probably wouldn't happen)!  The lamb burger is orgasmic, and even though they gave me a really bad stomach ache from being so rich, the fries are heaven as well.  They have really good happy hour prices for specific drinks and dishes.  I've also never had a bad cocktail here.

I can honestly say my only bad experience was during restaurant week.  Each course took 30 minutes to get.  The manager paid for one of my cocktails, but being there for 2 hours to get an appetizer, salad, dinner, and dessert was a bit painful.  I haven't had that problem since.

So, after a very long review, I would definitely say go and enjoy the place.  The food is unique; there's a neighborhood feel to the crowd and the servers, and minus a few bad eggs on the menu, the food and cocktails are delicious."}
{"text":"I pigged out at the Salty Sow's Sunday Brunch Buffet and I will do it again sometime!

I don't mean to boar you with details but this buffet wasn't typical of most buffets. Most buffets are just slop. The food here was a much higher quality and was VERY GOOD and not dried up or old. Everything was fresh and replaced quickly.

I squealed with delight when I tasted the crunchy, sticky, sweet and flavorful boneless fried chicken. There was so much food at the buffet nobody can eat everything.

Oh Lardy...There was Porchetta, Buttered Rainbow Trout Almandine, Fried Green Tomatoes in Guacamole, Beets with Goat Cheese, Brussels Spouts Caesar Salad, Cheese Grits, Hot Skillet Egg Dish, Jumbo Asparagus, Poached Eggs, Pork Chile Verde, Prime Rib Hash, Pastries and MORE! They will even make you an omelet if you request one.

The $5.00 build your own Bloody Mary bar isn't too shabby either with lots of hot sauces to add a variety of tomato juices, fun toppers like bacon and cheese stuffed olives and more.

They offer comfortable low top booths and mostly high top booths. They have a large dog friendly patio too.

At the time of this review the Sunday Brunch Buffet cost $18.95@ and is served 10-2 on Sundays.

It ain't no slop and feel free to eat like a swine."}
{"text":"Food was awesome!

Service was a complete disaster wrapped in a nasty ATTITUDE!

Won't be going back. Done and Done!!"}
{"text":"This place is legit. Hit happy hour here this week and had multiple excellent small dishes including the green chili stew (awesome and spicy) the fried chicken (super good) the pork belly taco (basically a breakfast taco) and the duck fat fries (of course delicious). Also had a couple of their specialty old fashions which are done quite well. 

Did not have a single bad bite. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I've been to the Salty Sow several times and we absolutely love their food. Their hot chicken sandwich is my favorite and it is definitely hot, but so tasty!! Excellent service as well as amazing food!"}
{"text":"Waited 20 mins to sit down. Sat down and waited another 10 mins for t
2 beers and a different waitress came and said our server didn't remember our drinks and got sent home. Then we saw our precious waitress then waited after ordering same 2 beers again for another 15 mins. Asked for manager who never came so we left. Horrible experience. Unacceptable"}
{"text":"Been here for happy hour quite a few times. One of the better happy hours in North Phoenix. Their fried chicken and with a biscuit is the way to go. If you are in need of a decent appetizer, duck fat fries. Also, one thing, bring back the bone marrow appetizer."}
{"text":"Great food, live music, fantastic place"}
{"text":"Sure give us our side of cauliflower rice 10 min after our main course is served...said nobody ever.  Actually I had to ask them to stop the order because we were already done. Very frustrating."}
{"text":"You don't really have to twist my arm to get to me to try a restaurant where pork prepared in any way is the main attraction.  So, when my husband and I had a chance to get away for a meal, I naturally chose Salty Sow.  I wish that I could talk about the wonderful dishes that I had, but they were all only okay.  I had the candied pork belly.  I guess in my head I pictures something somewhat crispy.  I was very wrong.  It's a braised dish.  It's not a bad dish, just not something I would convince me to come back again.

My husband had the lamb burger and I had to sample.  It was pretty good if you enjoy tapenade. It's not really for me.  

Service was good up until we asked for the check.  It felt like a lifetime before it finally arrived, and then it was wrong.

Overall, it was an okay experience."}
{"text":"I don't want to \"boar\" you with a lengthy review, but I can't help but feel the need to sing the praises of this fine gastropub!  If there's such thing as Hog Heaven, we found it here.

We were fortunate enough to be right next to Salty Sow when we decided 1) we were ready for dinner, and 2) we didn't have any particular food or restaurant we were craving at the time.  I remembered driving past it before, and that it was a place I had been wanting to try. Go me!

We went inside and were greeted and seated promptly by the hostess.  Hungry AND no wait? Win!  The deco is modern with a farm/barn feel.  Lots of wood finishes, open layout, large centrally-located bar, and of course, the obligatory pig (and rooster) paintings on the wall.  So far, so good.

We sat down and were greeted by our servers (one vet, one newbie).  Guess what?  It was happy hour, and we were provided with the appropriate menu.  The beautiful thing about their happy hour is that you can get a number of things for $5 each (their \"bites\" and \"small plates\").  Did I mention the full bar? Yep--$2 off wells and their \"Signature Sips.\"  Bring me the rum, savvy?

We started off with the truffle deviled eggs appetizer ($5).  How do you make deviled eggs better, you ask?  Well, my friend, let me enlighten you.  You make them with a touch of truffle and top them with bacon bits.  I felt like I was bi-winning by that point. 

Next up, duck fat fries.  Duck.  Fat.  Fries.  From this day forward, I will evermore be disappointed with every french fry I eat that isn't a duck fat french fry.  Damn you, Salty Sow! You've ruined me!  They are fried in duck fat (Captain Obvious to the rescue), then topped with a 110-minute egg and served with hollandaise sauce for dipping (think Benedict style).  I'm fairly certain that by the time I got to the end, I had my nose in the plate and was \"rooting\" around for hidden morsels.

Next came the main course, a trio of items we chose from the $5 selection to share.  My wife picked the Honey Rosemary Dipped Fried Chicken (with Cat Head Sweet Potato biscuit), and I chose the Spit-Roasted Pork Taco (with sweet onion slaw, pickled onions, smoked tomato salsa, and cilantro aioli) and the Beef Shoulder Taco (with fried egg, arugula, and feta).  Now, I preface this by saying I don't call myself the \"Taco Destroyer\" for nothing.  Ask my wife and friends...I have an unhealthy obsession with tacos.  These tacos were delicious.  I ate half of each and (begrudgingly) gave the rest to my wife.

OMG thank the gods I did.  I've had chicken and biscuits.  I've had chicken and waffles.  I've never had this.  My mouth waters and my stomach grumbles just thinking of that blend of salty and sweet, soft biscuit and crunchy breading, juicy chicken..............................................Sorry! Drifted off there for a second fantasizing about it.  I can neither confirm nor deny if I squealed while eating it.  Is there such thing as tri-winning?  Did I mention it was only $5 for happy hour...and enough to share????

Next stop, dessert.  I have to admit, there was a problem with dessert--that problem being we couldn't decide between the bananas foster (think bananas foster, dipped and deep fried in a monte cristo like breading, topped with powdered sugar, and served with caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream) and chocolate cake dessert (topped with whipped cream, raspberry sauce, and strawberries).  How to solve the problem? Order both, naturally.  Hey, if you're gonna go, go all out.  Sound delicious?  Multiply it by 10.  Then you might be getting close.  Maybe.  

Needless to say, we pigged out, thanked and tipped our waiters, and waddled to the car.  Pig puns aside, I only have one regret about the Salty Sow--we lived in Phoenix for an entire year before finding it.  My heart weeps to think of all those times I \"settled\" for a 4- or 5-star reviewed restaurant when I could have been dining here instead."}
{"text":"Ok- been here several times and it's gone from good to great!!! Love the decor and has a very chill vibe!
Ordered Brussels sprouts- fried green tomatoes eggplant fries and deviled eggs at the bar w a few drinks- FABULOUS- DELICIOUS 10 stars!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go to this restaurant for quite sometime and boy was it worth it! The food and drinks were amazing. The concepts are so unique and I am in love with the ingredients. We had stuffed figs with prosciutto for our appetizer from the specials menu. The taste was amazing! My husband had the French dip which was cooked to perfection while I had the lamb burger which was also amazing! The staff and service was top notch and the ambiance is young and vibrant with live music on the weekends. We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I was so happy to find this place. Flashback 2 years ago when I went to Austin,TX on a girls trip and had the BEST.... THE BEST braised beef EVER. Since then, I have moved, travelled, grown wiser, and so on... One  day I drove past this location and had to do double take. I had to try the food and it definitely did not disappoint. Seriously everything on this menu is great. Check out the one here and if you get a chance, Austin as well."}
{"text":"This place NEVERRRRR disappoints!  Thank you, Ryan, our server, and Doug, the General Manager, for taking GREAT care of us last night! 

We've been fans since Salty Sow's first year in operation. They just keep fine tuning an already great running engine. Food and service is always consistently good. We typically ask for the same server when we book our reservation, but occasionally we just spontaneously show up and take the luck of the draw - and it's always been good. Last night we decided to sit on the patio for dinner because the night was cool. Service out there was spot on, and Doug, the GM came around several times to make sure all was well.

The appetizers are delicious. I highly recommend the fried green tomatoes, though the ONLY criticism I'd give is that they give you 3 on a plate - and to share there should really be 4. I've made this suggestion many times. The guacamole with it is more than enough for 4 pieces.

The pork shoulder, their beans, green chile pork, prime rib - ALL delicious and consistent. And if you make a meal of a salad, you WILL make a meal and a half with their salads.

Though often \"noisy\" during peak hours, I LOVE the vibe of this place. It's where we go when we have guests in town and want to treat them to a delicious meal and consistently great service."}
{"text":"This is a unique place with some unique dishes. Delicious food, drink and dessert too. Lovely patio when the weather is nice and sometimes live music."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Crispy brussel sprouts, yum! Happy hour plates give you a chance to try several things. The buttermilk pie was \"to die for\". Will definitely come back next time I'm in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"We went here to try out their Girl Scout cookie dessert in February.  So first we got dinner.  I am the Queen of ceasar salads. So of course I ordered theirs. and Oh my Gosh was it good!! Best and most unique ceasar I have ever had! They used brussel sprouts instead of lettuce and the dressing was just perfect!!  My boyfriend got pork and he loved it as well!

The ambiance is great. Some live music in the back. Big open bar area. Lovely dining for a date night.

The waitress was wonderful as well!

The dessert we finally got to was great. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"food is great! Love the fact they serve only local craft beers."}
{"text":"My wife and I discovered this place while vacationing in Scottsdale. We didn't want to dine anywhere else! We tried several different menu items. The pork roast appetizer is fantastic! Lunch salmon is good. The honey dipped rosemary fried chicken is sinfully great! Try the Orange Blossom Ale. It's refreshing and tasty. Friendly great service and comfortable decor."}
{"text":"The best buffet, chefs were so kind and funny! I hope their treated well and the servers too. Great energy. The food was loaded with so much flavor. I don't eat a lot of pork, but I compromised. The food outstanding the biscuits were bomb."}
{"text":"We were excited when they first opened we lived nearby~and like pork dishes.  There is nothing we saw on the Menu that sounded good.  We received a incentive from Marketing I think it was $20 off of 50 so we thought well maybe....So disappointed. The Menu is for foodies with No Limit to there budget. I spent 15 years in hospitality business including fine dining, M of Chicago D Frisco's Prime steak.  I know food, I know good service.  The waitress got into a snit when I asked her a question, maybe because it was is there any normal dishes on the menu ?  Kidding- I simply asked what was the most popular dish....Well we couldn't feel comfortable ordering the weird pork dishes, so we ordered steak, and it was okay but not fab Decor is extra nice...would love it if there HH had decent REAL food on it... but my dining $$ are dear too me, and this place is less than wonderful, too limited, too expensive. I would rather go to a dive with Great Normal Food than a nice Restaurant with Weird food. 
I have dining at many 4 and 5 star places, like seafood, good beef, and great ventures in dining.....this was NOT one of those experiences. The steak as Pat B said looked smaller than advertised and while the fries were good- they weren't that Flipping good. Very surprised if this concept makes it.  When I want PORK do you mean there isn't even a Pork Chop on the Menu? They didn't even have pulled pork on the Menu when we went.. I think Chefs Really go off the deep end with a Menu like this were EVERYTHING is for Only Culinary Snobs.  Call me crazy but I want food I recognize and for Value a HH like Flo's Where Everything is HALF OFF  including Yummy food.............   So disappointed in this Concept.  Even if i was Offered a FREE Meal here I would just skip it.  Meh- I have experienced better    Way better."}
{"text":"Interesting menu with lots of original offerings, however it is fairly limited. Great beer selection!  Prices are a little high for what you are getting. Great central location."}
{"text":"On my recent trip to Phoenix we had an afternoon meeting with clients and they chose to regroup at Salty Sow after work.  This was a fantastic choice, the ambiance was great and the restaurant was immaculate without being too fussy.  As per usual, we started with several appetizers Duck Fat Fries, Truffled Deviled Eggs, Shrimp Cocktail \"Stuffed\" Avocado, and House-Made Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms.  The fries were pretty good, a little greasy, the Deviled Eggs were good, but to be fair, not as good as my mom's.  Now, the House-Made Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms were the highlight of the meal.  I could have ordered a round or two of these as my meal.  

As this was the last meal during our travels and I had already had quite the food tour, I decided this was a good night for salad.  I ordered the A.B.L.T. and I was not disappointed.  The Salty Sow Bacon and avocado made for a fantastic combination with the lettuce and tomato.  I visit again on another trip where I actually have an appetite."}
{"text":"One of the better out of state 'corporate' restaurants.  The innovative menu, hipster vibe, and commitment to the community all justify a place alongside the locally bred and loved options.  Some great comfort food options but also a shout out for some innovative side dishes like the pastrami salmon and white corn cheese girts."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and the service has aways been pretty good and the food is even better. Duck Fat Fries are pretty good, but that best thing here can only be ordered on Sundays. Make sure you get there early otherwise they'll sell out of the Sunday Special. Folks, I leave you with two words... PORCHETTA SUNDAYS :)"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times, have brought friends, and have always loved it. Saturday night, live music (although not the regular guy, who is Amazing- jay or Jason?). Eggplant frites, lamb burger, dirty sow martini, all amazing!!!  Patio is fantastic and I can't wait for the weather to cool off to come more often. By far the best restaurant in the area! Service and food have always been spectacular! 100% recommend for those who like good food, atmosphere, drinks and price."}
{"text":"The food here is great, custom drinks are really good and the service (Bethany) is pretty amazing! There was a hiccup with the computer system but they took care of us accordingly! 

Will be back."}
{"text":"Service is why I give this restaurant a 1 star. Wait time until you get a water is too long. Wait to order food is too long. When food makes it to the table, half of it is warm and half is already cold.  This has happened twice. We love the look and how cozy this place is on the inside however the service is really bad."}
{"text":"First experience was nice! Alil loud, but its a nice social feel. Food was pretty good. I was alil disappointed that i didnt get to try the food i saw on the reviews. Didnt know they change menus weekly. Amazing plate presentation! Nice interior layout! I'd definitely come back again to try new dishes!"}
{"text":"Let me first say, I have been here a few times before I decided to write a review. I love this place. The food is awesome! Must try the beef shoulder! Nice ambiance, great music, and attentive staff. Extra thumbs up for the Bartender Brie, she rocks!"}
{"text":"Didn't Disappoint 

If you're looking for great food options, reasonable prices, friendly service, and ambiance.  Then look no further, the Salty Sow is calling your name. The service at Salty Sow was amazing - our server never missed a beat and had a wonderful attitude and personality and the food was fabulous. 

We started with appetizers,  Truffled Deviled Eggs, and Triple Fried Duck Fat Fries, one word, delicious. For our entrees I ordered the Fish and Chips and my dinner companion ordered the Pork over Mashed Potatoes. Both of us thoroughly enjoyed our dishes. 
The meal ended with a decadent dessert, Bananas Foster Beignets, made with cane syrup, honey & nutmeg ice cream, amazing.

What a pleasurable dinning experience. I can't say enough about the Salty Sow. Definitely a place to visit when in the area."}
{"text":"As I'm starting to do more reviews, I'm realizing my little family is dominating the greater Phoenix food scene. We tried to hit this place up once before but it's a dinner only grub hub.  We brought the baby with us as we believe he is amazing and acts very well behaved. Most children prob should stay away. The food is a foodies paradise. We started with one of the better charcuterie boards that we've tried in a long time. It was loaded with some common goodies and a solid mix of items we had never heard of or even thought up. Loved it all. This place has a really cool environment with live music and fun knowledgable servers. We pigged out on a plethora of porky dishes and left stuffed. There's not much I can think of that I'd do different. I'll blame the perfectly mixed martini for that. If you're a valley native what are you waiting for?"}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten here several times and we are never disappointed. Yes the prices are a little on the higher side, but for what you get on a plate, it's very well worth it. Their fish dishes are fantastic, the hanger steak is amazing, tasty appetizers, delicious desserts, and you can't beat the happy hour prices. The atmosphere is always fun and I enjoy when they have live music. The servers have always been helpful and attentive. Some pretty tasty cocktails as well. We will definitely continue to visit the Salty Sow."}
{"text":"The pork belly taco with the poached egg is the bomb! Great HH. Fun place to just go and relax. In the summers though I wish they would keep the air lower in there. We had a big BDay party and while everyone was accommodating, it was hot at the long table by the kitchen. It's by the kitchen so understandable. Brunch there is nice too."}
{"text":"This review dates back to July when my wife and I went to Scottsdale for a long weekend. We had originally planned on going to another place but it was closed for the 4th of July weekend so we settled on the Salty Sow (first timers). We really like the atmosphere in this place, great decor with all the fat pig paintings and terrific service. We sort of tried multiple dishes such as the charcuterie tablet, they were all very good, and very reasonable for the price. Overall a great place to go if you are in the mood for some good food and a good time."}
{"text":"Salty Sow is a jewel in the neighborhood.  The food us gourmet quality so the folks n the neighborhood don't have to drive North or to South Scottsdale.  Absolutely eat here."}
{"text":"I always get the French dip, which has high quality meat inside a delicious roll. The duck fat fries are really good, though I've never had the 110 minute egg on top. I've also tried several cocktails, the Blanche is my favorite. Service is always good and the atmosphere is very nice."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here and we were so impressed. Exceptional service, food was delicious and the restaurant is beautiful. Our server was literally one of the sweetest servers I have met. Very gracious, we will be back."}
{"text":"Good spot to grab a drink, listen to live music, and they have a decent menu to match as well. I would say the price structure doesn't match the quality or depth of flavor you'd expect out of a spot with Burgers starting at $15 and appetizer stews at $12. If you're looking for budget concious outing you might want to explore other options."}
{"text":"I wish I could remember our servers name because first and foremost, he was awesome. We brought our two babies (under 2) with us and he was sympathetic as a fellow parent and was quick, efficient, patient, polite but never pushy to get us out of there. He was extremely knowledgeable about the menu which helped us make quick decisions to order and was right there bringing refills of any sort, the dessert menu in the middle of entrees upon request so we could try as much as possible (of course) and boxes so we could enjoy our dessert that was promptly brought out on top of entrees (upon request---eating out with 2 under 2 is so fun sometimes :)). Last but not least, the food was impeccable. We ordered items like the duck fat fries, the crispy Brussel sprouts. French dip, burger and budino. My husband and I can't wait to go back when we have a babysitter so we can take our time more next time!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I wanted some appetizers and drinks and decided to try this place out...we were a bit skeptical at first because of the name and the way the building looked, but since it was unique it captured our curiosity.   When we walked in the staff was very friendly greeting us and the place looked very upscale and nice.  The lighting was relaxing and there was an outdoor patio that was open to the inside of the restaurant which I like, makes the place feel more open.   There looked to be managers dressed in business suits walking around helping out the staff which I thought was nice, not sure if they were there because it just opened.  We looked at the menu and since we're both natives to Arizona (yes I know rare) we had never heard of some of the things on the menu but wanted to try.   We ordered something called Duck Fries, the fries are made in duck fat and vegetable oil and topped with a 110 min egg (looked poached) and came with some kind of bernay sauce, anyway it was fabulous!  I ordered a sangria which was very tasty, looked like it was made with mostly white wine and my boyfriend ordered kilt lifter (on tap) which was also excellent.  We ordered a spinach and artichoke dip which supposedly came out late (we didn't even notice) so the manager came over and said he took it off the bill.  Honestly if they were trying to make an impression they did, this is a great place for couples and families and the food and service are great.  We'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for a place for brunch. Celebrating our 27th anniversary, we looked at many of the most popular but most were booked. We found the Salty Sow as an option and decided it looked like a good option. Awesome! Too many great dishes to write about, but you can try them all since it's a buffet! When I saw the price online I was skeptical since it seemed too good to be true. It exceeded all expectations! I typically go for basics at brunch as I love eggs and omelets, but there were too many other choices that I wanted to try. If I wanted eggs they would have made them to order. The thing that put me over the top was their porchetta stuffed with chorizo. I will go back just for that! Our check was probably half of what you expect to pay for a quality brunch and we couldn't have enjoyed it any more. I asked about how they prepare the porchetta and the executive chef practically wrote down the recipe for me. The pride he takes in his work is obvious! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"My second visit and I really enjoy this place!   Had drinks and snacks. Had the nachos which are really wonderful. Great pork bbq and a spicy queso make these special. Also tried the chicken on a stick. This is an interesting fried chicken idea. Great crust on skewered chicken tenders with a honey mustard dipping sauce. Delicious if a bit hard to get off the stick. Try this place for happy hour. It was fun!!"}
{"text":"The Food was absolutely AMAZING.  Don't go here if you're looking for a hamburger.  They have food for semi-adventurous eaters... interesting ingredients and preparations.  Overall the food was just crazy good.  Can't wait to go back this weekend and try more selections from their menu."}
{"text":"Go there often, the food amazing and so are the drinks.  
(french dip with mashed potatoes)

Patio seating is great and its pretty."}
{"text":"The Sow made for a fun Saturday night. It's a big place, we chose a high top behind the huge wraparound bar. The service was great. I thought my wife and server were going to make plans after. She did a great job. I would give up French fries for the eggplant frites appy. Wife had the salad, which I had no interest in trying. She said the PV salad was delish. I had the French dip. It's as good as you will find. $14. Good energy in this place, and reasonable prices make it a must go. Music on the patio was a dude playing guitar on the patio, playing songs we all know. Much better than I'm making him sound. We were stuffed but still got the butter cake with ice cream. Yum. My stomach hates me."}
{"text":"WE LOVE SALTY SOW!! My wife and I have been here numerous times and we have never been disappointed. We have ordered almost everything on the menu throughout our visits. Some of our favorites are the chicken thighs, the slow cooked beef shoulder and trout. Service is always on point. We have had MaryAnn as our server on several occasions ms she is a rock star. So ask to be in her section if you can! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I came here on a mission for Duck Fat Fries. I come from SoCal, where a handful of restaurants there have BOMB Duck Fat Fries, and after moving here, I've been misssssssing me some Duck Fat Fries.... And though Salty Sow was unique about it with their long-minute cooked/poached eggs... They were a bit disappointing. There wasn't that unique Duck Fat flavoring.. They honestly just tasted like fries with egg. Darn! I'm sad again! 

Anyways... Walking into this restaurant, it's pretty chill on the outside. Walk inside, it's pretty busy for a week night. The patio is a must-sit unless it's too hot. I really like this place's patio. Lights, plenty of seating... and they had a guy singing - who was rather good. He definitely set the kick-back mood. This place seemed like it could be a mix between Hip but Romantic/Classy-esque. I can't really pinpoint it.

I ordered the Moscato which was okay - I was hoping for a little more sweet and carbonated, but it was still good. The Chicken Thighs were tasty, especially with their \"smashed potatoes\". My date ordered the Candied Pork Belly - that's a must try as it was very tasty.

Overall, the service was really good and everyone was really nice. The manager came by to see how we were doing. The restaurant is definitely a good sight for the eyes... Ahhh them duck fat fries though! Still... I give four stars."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved Salty Sows.  We started off with one of their signature sips called Blanche, which was a house blood orange margarita, very tasty and strong.  For dinner we both ordered the trio which included bacon, pork belly and pork shoulder.  All of it was great but the pork shoulder was absolutely fabulous. I would highly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Oh wow!! One of my new favorite places. My hubby and I tried it out on Saturday night. Made reservations and we were seated right away. It's a fun and lively place. Love the open kitchen. 
We tried the fried green tomatoes and truffle deviled eggs. Both were incredibly good. Who would have thought guacamole on fried green tomatoes would taste that good. 
I ordered the pork belly. It was amazing and done right.  I hate going to restaurants and ordering pork belly and pulled pork comes out. The grits that came with it were also good. 
My hubby ordered the prime rib and didn't leave a crumb on his plate. He said it was cooked so good he had to go compliment the chef. 
Service was good also. A great place with delicious food. We will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"We were here a few months back, I was so disappointed it took me a while to write this down.
I had the ribeye... it was original but very skimpy ribeye... I never had a ribeye so small... : ( Menu says 10 oz but if looked more like 8.
On top of that, when you say 'no horseradish' and then your dish arrives  and the first think you notice is the horseradish all over it... well, not very encouraging...
On a positive not I also had the CAULIFLOWER & WILD RICE CASSEROLE and it was really really good.
Hubby had the halibut and he thought it was so so.
Mainly, I do not think we will be back anytime soon. 
The place looks nice and fun, but I guess we are not their demographic."}
{"text":"It can be really awesome. It depends on the time of the day that you catch them. I find the evening service better than the afternoon or happy hour. 

Food is great and really consistent with a nice blend of creativity. Staff are very cordial and trained in their roles. The setting is beautiful and the bar warming with design to engage others around you. You must experience it for yourself. I have never had a bad meal here.

{"text":"Sugar. Oil. Sugar. Oil. Sugar. Oil....

I try hard to review places based on how well they do what they're trying to do... and not just my own enjoyment.

For example... in this case, if I was eating at a dive bar, the amount of oil soaking my burger bun, and amount of sugar mixed with my Brussels sprouts --while not pleasing to my pallete-- would have been accepted.

However, it isnt a dive bar... this place is going for the gastro-pub hip-American-new eatery... and if that's the theme, I need a LOT more from the kitchen. 

Resorting to covering savory dishes in sugar, and smothering everything in oil is a culinary cop out...

Staff was professional and decor was awesome. The idea is right... but the dishes are just missing."}
{"text":"Dayum! I've never used that word in a review before, but it seems appropriate tonight.  My Curly Tail (funky tequila cocktail with a serrano infused ice cube) was the hit of the night, but the crispy brussel sprouts and the chorizo stuffed mushrooms did not suck.....a happy hour like none other!"}
{"text":"We love this place!! First time we came we did happy hour which is amazing. Second time we brought our dog and they had us sit in the enclosed patio area with live music, super cozy. They also brought him water and homemade dog treats. The food is great. Always good service. Can't wait to go back again and again!"}
{"text":"Fun place to go for hh. They have a good selection and good prices. This is now my go to place since sanctuary raised their hh prices. Try the street tacos they are delicious and good sized. I haven't been here for dinner yet but hope to soon and will update my review"}
{"text":"Good food and service. Took family there over the holidays and the food was great! Will Definitely return in the future."}
{"text":"Awesome.   Beautiful place.  They don't promote it but they're patio is dog friendly. We camenwith our 9 year old pug. Angel on the patio was also awesome    very personable.   I thought he was a server. Brunch looked fantastic!!!  We will be bac5j"}
{"text":"We had an amazing brunch here with our family.  Food was outstanding, service was excellent.  Favorite dishes included green chile pork, chocolate chip banana french toast, fresh berries, bacon, pork loin, turkey, biscuits... you can't go wrong here.  This is hands down our new brunch spot when family comes in from out of town.  My dad is rarely impressed by restaurants, especially for brunch, and he even took the time to compliment the manager on the way out.  Truly great place!"}
{"text":"This was our second time to Salty Sow - since the first was such a good experience. We invited another couple with us to celebrate their anniversary, they enjoyed it as well (their first time). 
The food is great, service is on their game, waiter and bussing staff, and the wine selection is very good. Also, the red wine is kept at the right temperature (about 60 degrees); Too often restaurants don't pay attention to this detail.
The atmosphere is inviting, boisterous but not too loud. Though this boarders on fine/eclectic dinning, it is very casual. The outdoor seating is also great!"}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, the drinks were really good and so was the food.  The okra and deviled eggs appetizer were on point! Will def be back."}
{"text":"Wow, about the slowest service in town. Food is good but very became frustrated at the service and that degraded our experience."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to go to dinner. Whenever we have guests we take them here. The duck fat fries and Brussel sprouts are great to start with. The pork shoulder, bone in filets and their farm salad are a few of our favorites. Live music and a fireplace creates a nice ambiance."}
{"text":"The food here is always great!! One of my favorite restaurants in the valley, I highly recommend the Hangar Steak, Beef Shoulder, or Crispy Chicken...can't go wrong! The beer selection is a plus because they serve Lumberyard Pilsner."}
{"text":"Always a great spot to frequent. Delicious food (lamb burger, fried chicken, Brussel sprout salad, fried green tomatoes, stuffed mushrooms, short rib tacos) nice atmosphere, classy ambiance & big patio area. The wait staff is always fast & friendly. Tanner was our last waiter & he was great. He kept our signature cocktails coming & our water glasses full. The table was cleared promptly when dishes were finished. Their HH is fun & always busy. We prefer to sit on the patio, on nice days but the inside seating is also very inviting. Definitely try this spot out if you haven't had the chance. You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"We really have enjoyed every dish we've tried from the pork belly, prime rib, porchetta, trout almondine , halibut and the truffled eggs and chicken liver mousse happy hour appetizers. It's all SO good! The wait staff is excellent although sometimes when super busy we have to wait a bit more for service. We have to give a \"shout out\" to our frequent busser, Ignacio. He's awesome!"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for fried chicken on a Sunday night. To my dismay the chicken establishments we frequent were closed. I searched on yelp and set our navigation system to the Salty Sow.
I selected the crispy chicken thighs. They were pan fried without a batter and served on top of fingerling potatoes with an incredible gravy. This dish would pale in comparison to the size of franchise restaurants, however, I could not finish the serving. I believe the richness of the gravy, the perfect saltiness of the potatoes, and the crispness of the chicken made for a satisfying and filling dish. I am looking forwards to my lunch of leftovers tomorrow.
Hubby had their Sunday night pork specialty. The pork was juicy and served with fingerlings and garlic toast. With determination he finished his entree with the exception of all the bread.
We shared a piece of brown butter cake which was okay. Not great, not bad, but not good enough to order again."}
{"text":"Salty Sow is a gastropub that serves \"contemporary farmhouse fare\" according it its website.  As you can guess by considering the name, there are some great bacon and pork dishes though by no means does that mean there are no options for you should you not eat bacon/pork or even meat.  There are some great salads, vegetables, and fish.  

Happy hour is daily from 4:30-6:30 PM.  $2 off signature sips and wells, $5 happy hour wine, and $5 or $7 bites, which are honestly quite filling if you get a few of them to share.  The signature sips are very creatively put together and quite tasty, and my favorite sharable side dishes during happy hour include truffled deviled eggs and honey rosemary dipped fried chicken (complete with a biscuit).  

You can make a reservation using Open Table though more often than not, there is a table available even if just at the bar.  Other fun facts.  There are two other locations in Austin (Texas), which is one of my favorite cities!   There is also a rewards program that I have yet to figure out but the website makes reference to.  Salty Sow is also part of the same family of restaurants as Roaring Fork in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Everything I've had here has been great, it's a bit pricey, but what you'd expect for a place on the Scottsdale border. I'd consider it a $$$. Salad with Brussels sprouts and pork belly awesome, filet mignon with red wine reduction and trout special was awesome, white wine sangria awesome and a good beer selection. Good stuff"}
{"text":"5-Star Food, 2-Star Service

The service at the Salty Sow drives me away, but the food keeps me coming back. I've been here a half dozen times over the past 2 years. We first came in on Labor Day when they were offering buy one, get one free entrees. Service was great our first time and has been terrible every time since.

I visited this past week with a friend for our weekly Happy Hour. I asked our server about one of the cocktails and I assumed he must have been new because he gave me the look like he had no idea what was in it. That's fine if you don't know - just tell me you need to double check. I decided on the Blanche - homemade blood orange frozen margarita - which was great; not too sweet and generous with the tequila. My friend had the bourbon sour, which also was heavy on the bourbon - thumbs up!

Happy Hour offers $2 off signature cocktails, which run $7-$9. They also have a nice variety of small bites for either $5 or $7. First round, we got all three tacos (pork belly, spit-roasted pork, and catfish) and the crispy brussels sprout leaves. The food was delicious! I loved the pork belly taco and my friend raved about the catfish. The fried egg on both pork tacos was cooked perfectly. The brussels sprouts were amazing. I find too many places make them too crispy. These were cooked perfectly and the golden raisins added just the right amount of sweetness. I am normally not a huge fan of raisins, especially in savory foods, but they hit the mark on this dish.

First round of apps and drinks completely gone for 10 minutes and no sign of our server. I had to flag him down to get another cocktail - this time The Petey (Deep Eddy grapefruit vodka, mint, orange, agave & soda) and an order of the honey rosemary honey dipped fried chicken and the chicken liver mousse. The Petey is a great summer drink - again, not too sweet and generous with the booze. The chicken was spot on - so moist and not greasy at all. The chicken liver mousse was for my better half who told me that I had better plan to sleep at my friend's house if I wasn't bringing an order home. It is his favorite app in the Valley.

Half way through our second round, the server asked if we wanted the check. No he did not ask if we wanted any more food or another round of drinks - the check. I said, \"No, but we would love another round of drinks.\" Halfway through that round, the check was dropped, followed shortly thereafter by our server letting us know he was leaving. Did we want to close out? Mind you, this was at 8:25 PM. If this was midnight and we'd just been sitting there for hours, I can get it. And this is why it will be several months before I come back.

I've also had the entrees on previous visits (the chicken thighs, halibut, and beef shoulder stand out) and I've yet to have a dish that I have not loved. Please Salty Sow, raise your service game up to the level of your food quality."}
{"text":"Still a fan! Looking for a unique brunch option? This is the place!! 

For under $20/person you'll find an array of savory items like cauliflower wild rice, brussel sprout salad, ham, porchetta, fried chicken and waffles, fried green tomatoes, green chile stew... PLUS eggs/omelets cooked to order. 


The dessert options/breakfast sweets are a bit of a disappointment but there are $5 mimosas and bloody mary bar, so who needs dessert! ;)

I would still rate this the best buffet brunch in the Valley!"}
{"text":"I would have to agree with the other reviews in regards to inattentive service.  Went for Restaurant Week and it seemed more advantageous to order off the regular menu.  Wanted to have the bone in filet medallions but they were out on a Tuesday so back to the RW menu.  Caesar salads were DELICIOUS.  Decided on the Bacon Butter Stacked Pork Chop but in reality it was center cut pork LOIN.  Big difference in flavor profile but still very delicious.  Wife had the salmon and she left none so it was very DELICIOUS also and the desserts were EXCELLENT.  Service was very inattentive but rectified by Jenna the bartender/manager.  Definitely going back but with expectations of better service or I could just sit at the bar with Jenna."}
{"text":"Epic! Never dissapointed!  The pork shoulder is delicious....i get that almost every time. Great drinks as well."}
{"text":"This review is not for the food but for the establishment itself. The wife and I seen this locale had just opened right in front of the Wal-Mart. Now seeing that it also next door to Outback Steakhouse I wasn't expecting to much.....however I was surprised at the Ambiance. The outdoor seating is very nice.....and the Indoor seating has great booths with high tables attached to them. I have been to a couple of restaurants like this in Illinois and I really like the setup. The mood lighting is also very good....and it provides a very nice romantic atmosphere. I will give this place a try for lunch and dinner and at that time I will update this review to talk about the food and service. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!"}
{"text":"so great to have good food in the neighborhood...not for the diet conscious, but everything we had was tasty!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant!  The food is very good, and there is live music on the weekends.  The open air layout and decor is amazing."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, eclectic menu, great service at a fair price.  Everything I like in a restaurant.  The goat cheese fritters were amazing, but need to ask for more bread if you order.  The crispy thighs were good, but looking forward to ordering more items off their varied menu."}
{"text":"Ok so being a vegetarian I'm probably like the worst person to be reviewing a meat-focused restaurant, but I had to share my great experience! I took my boyfriend here for his birthday on Monday and we were both pleased! Our server was super helpful in helping me find a good vegetarian meal that would fill me up! I got the vegetable antipasto with a side of quinoa and lentils (which is cooked in butter not animal stock). It was so good, the vegetables were delicious and there was a great variety, I really liked the roasted carrots and arugula salad. I don't even remember what my boyfriend got, I think pork that had a little bit of bacon on top or something? Idk but he loved it! I was worried that since we had been talking about going for months that his expectations would be too high, but it met his high expectations! Also they offered us a free birthday brownie and ice cream but we were getting him dessert after so we declined haha. Great experience though I'll recommend to meat lovers!"}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch was a great experience.  Food was amazing and the service was top notch. I am totally going back asap!"}
{"text":"I have been here more than half a dozen times. The food and drink are FANTASTIC. 

The staff during my first few visits were fabulous. The last 2 visits, left a bad taste in my mouth. If I don't feel like a valued customer no matter how awesome your food is, I won't be back. 

I was there last night and the hostess was not greeting anyone with any sort of eye contact, smile or warmth and names were barked off in my face while waiting to be acknowledged. It was my dates first time there and we chose to leave. 

4 stars for the food. Maybe in a few months I will try it again."}
{"text":"Terrible service from the minute we walked in the door. Unfriendly host staff. The server didn't introduce himself, and when he asked if we wanted something to drink, I went to order a glass of Malbec, he completely walked away- I had to tell another server. 
The appetizers came out at the same time as the entrees, with the exception of the ahi tuna special, which came out about 8 minutes later, and well done. 
Once the food arrived, our server never asked how anything was. We were not offered desert, and had to request split checks. There's an Outback in the same plaza. Save yourself the terrible experience, and go there instead. The service was reminiscent of fecal matter."}
{"text":"Copper Mule to start followed by delicious Louisiana Boudin Fritters.  These fritters were great and spicy.  The rotisserie pork is outstanding!  Very tender and full of flavor.  Dessert was a rich chocolate truffle cake, again very awesome.  Our server was very helpful with suggestions and descriptions.  The open kitchen is a great touch, fun to watch the Chef's in action."}
{"text":"Amazing hand down my favorite place to enjoy a great meal!!! I come here all the time small groups big group no matter always amazing service! The drinks will tickle your fancy!!! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed, walking up and sitting down this place looks amazing. The atmosphere was solid and comfortable.

Our waiter was nice but clueless on the basics, we ordered the prime rib which was their \"go to\" and it came out cold, my girlfriend ordered the French dip with fries and that too came out cold with the fries being soggy!! 

We asked 3 times if there were a possibility of reservations on Mother's Day and the manager was supposed to come by and never did. 

Leaving the server finally said \"come in and sit at the bar\". 

Ok bud, let bring my mom in and sit at the bar with my family?!

Disappointed and not professional....serving isn't hard people I did it threw college."}
{"text":"Stumbled onto this nice restaurant.  The service was a tad slow but the food was AMAZING.  Some of the combinations of flavors weren't a natural choice for me--but after one taste I was sold.

My second time back I found my favorite salad of all time."}

You know that I taste it
And you know that I ordered it
I want it bad, at the Salty Sow

I want your drinks and
I want your bacon
Yelp and me could write about the Salty Sow
(Oh-oh-oh--oh-oooh!)
I want your pork and
All your chocolate bacon
Yelp and me could write about the Salty Sow

Happy Hour at the Salty Sow

Rah-rah-ah-ah-ah-ah!
Rama-ramama-ah
Salty-ooh-la-la!
Want some Salty Sow

Salty Sow is straight out of Austin, Texas and the Chef is offering up a James Beard menu so get your name on the list if you can!  

I've been here for a Yelp event and came back once more for Happy Hour.  I ordered their pork belly tacos and stuffed mushrooms.  The stuffed mushrooms came first and I thought it was pretty tasty! A top with some pork sausage and parmesan cheese, this starter had some pop.  All 3 ingredients had its distinct taste and vied for position on my palate; no matter it's going to end in the same place haha!  The star of the night was the pork belly tacos -- Yummy!  Topped with an over-easy egg and arugula! Uh! Food-porn did this delicious bite no justice!  Needless to say you must come here to try it and understand what I'm talking about.  The saltiness of the bacon combined with the settle bitterness of the arugula mixed with the creaminess of the egg ---- oooooo! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We love this restaurant and go quite often. I usually have their French dip and duck fat fries. The BEST!"}
{"text":"Went there for a gal pal birthday bash.  Craig was our server.   When you go, ask for Craig.   Very professional, accommodating, friendly, and efficient.   We asked for suggestions and recommendations and received both as to the food and drinks.  Since there were a few of us, we ordered from the happy hour menu the deviled eggs, the duck fries topped with an over easy egg and I think bearnaise sauce, the eggplant frites, the fried chicken and biscuit, fish taco, shrimp cocktail.  For our drinks we had the blanche royale, maple glazed old fashion, cosmo, and blanche margarita along with an ale.  I had the old fashion and agreed it was very good.   With the maple syrup in it, I thought it would be maple syrupy.   Not at all.   Yumms!

Okay.   Straight up, I'll say that I am not a fried food kinda gal, but the food was good.  I ate the deviled egg (I know.   It's not fried), the duck fries, the fried chicken and biscuit and the eggplant frites.   If I was a fried food kinda gal, yep, I'd say it was very good.   

For dessert, for our birthday gal, we shared the bananas foster, which was again fried, but accompanied by a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Go.   The happy hour pricing is great.   For the rest of October, there is a buy one/get one free lunch.   Since they have more than just the fried food for lunch, I'd try their lunch."}
{"text":"FABULOUSLY DELICIOUS! 
Over the top brunch with flavors and selection to appease everyone at any age. Grilled omelettes made to order filled with several options but please think about spoiling yourself with their grilled vegetables inserted. Flavor flavor flavor! And for those Bloody Mary drinkers, welcome to heaven! A selection of additives to rival any fully stocked bar and your imagination. Lastesly, stellar and friendly service from our server Lauren. Smiles abound!"}
{"text":"We had the charcuterie and it was good. Unique flavors. Terrific bread, good service. Nice restaurant with a big kitchen view. Great live music and fun ambience. I'd return here."}
{"text":"What an unexpected treat looking for a place to get dinner after my son's haircut and came across this gem! Ambiance is beautiful, subtle decor nice lighting very comfortable. Food was different but not SO different you were left wondering will I like what I ordered? I had crisp chicken thighs with potatoes very tasty not overbearing in flavors. Ended with dessert,  had the banana beignets OMG was it good!!! This place is great for family dinner or dates. Our server was friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. Definitely try this place if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"I walked in alone and was instantly greeted at the door. I was waiting for my date to arrive so I pulled up a seat at the bar. I only waited a few moments before he showed but was given water and a menu at the bar.

 We moved outdoors to the patio that was quite warm and listened to the live music. We had his dog and Mr. Franks was graciously welcomed in. 

We started with two drinks the old fashioned (his) and the sour(mine) my drink was well balanced and u could tell they used good ingredients. 

We also ordered the fries. Of which were good but not as flavorful and crispy as normal. Hence the 4 stars. 

I got the beetle shoulder and it's always a favorite he has the trout (I thought it was a bit greasy) and he liked it. 

No dessert was ordered as we were so full but I have had the banana doughnuts and they are fantastic! 

Overall a good place and a place I'll always return too.

Ps the president was there of the company and he was so friendly. Forgot our menus and to tell our server we where there lol. The service staff and us all for a great laugh from this."}
{"text":"I haven't come here until now as this location has been a restaurant graveyard. Let's hope this place doesn't suffer a similar fate as it's quite good. Very nice ambience. 

Good solid comfort food with a modern twist. A little heavy but quite good. Happy hour on Monday and Tuesday make it a value."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  The beef shoulder dish was the definition of comfort food.  They have a nice selection of beers and the chocolate cake for dessert really hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Had date night last night with the Mrs.  Every dish was fantastic. Started with the deviled eggs and fried green tomatoes and guacamole. The guac was awesome.  Wife PV salad, good as always.  I had a special suckling pig and a side of wild rice and cauliflower. Wow. Ended with the bananas foster beignets.   Thanks to Beth and her great staff for a wonderful night out!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here 4 times and it has always just been okay. They have a decent beverage program   And the food is alright. My reasoning behind the three stars is that I would like to see more creativity as the menu is a bit stagnant from not changing frequently. Again you can come and get a good experience here but after 3 or 4 times it becomes redundant"}
{"text":"Best dang French dip in town!!!!!!! I wish they had more vegetarian options since everyone I know is vegetarian, but for meat eaters...spectacular!!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere and decor are really nice.  The food is great.  The service was horrible.  

We decided to try out Salty Sow on Saturday July 5th.  The place only had 17 people seated and I saw no fewer than 12 people on staff.  During the course of our meal our waitress promised an ice tea refill on 3 separate occasions and only delivered on one of those.  We actually went over to the (very helpful) bartender and he filled my tea and swapped out my girlfriend's beer that tasted a bit off.  Our waitress was never around, but there were plenty of other staff just standing around the kitchen area not doing anything. 

The manager seemed to mostly wander aimlessly around the perimeter of the exposed kitchen, sometimes looking at the expo tickets.  I never saw him check on any tables or do anything productive. 

With the negative part out of the way...the beef shoulder roast entree and the green chili appetizer were both delicious.  If we had just seated ourselves at the bar, I believe this likely would have been a 4, if not 5, star experience."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday, food was amazing! The 110 minute egg with the duck fat fries are a must try!"}
{"text":"I met a friend here for an early Thursday night dinner.   They have live music Thursdays - Saturdays which is a nice touch but if you are looking for a quiet place you might want to try Salty Sow on another night.  

Our server was attentive but not pushy.  The menu includes some interesting options and opportunities to try something new:  
- Pork belly taco - A little messy with egg on top but very good. 
- Crispy Brussels Sprout leaves -   I could eat a huge bowl of theses.  They were amazing.   
- Rainbow Trout Almondine - We both had this and agreed it lacked flavor.   The crispy capers were a nice addition but it needed something more.   

If I'm in the neighborhood I'd love to stop back and try some other menu items."}
{"text":"I love Gastropubs.  Fancy cocktails, craft beers and small bites that are a tad on the heavy side.  This place didn't disappoint.  Blood orange margarita, old fashioned with  maple syrup.  All beers from AZ.  Nice touch.

The triple duck fat fries seemed to be single fried but the egg and dipping sauce were good.  The pate was nice and the bone marrow was rich.  I had the pork belly which was nicely proportioned.

Each item I've had was just a little less than perfect but the prices were more than reasonable.  

Ambiance is nice with an open kitchen that seemed to have a small chef's table.

This place has the kind of menu I like and the prices to allow me to stay all night."}
{"text":"I wish they still had the sous vided eggs, hope they put those back on the menu. I also like their stuffed muschrooms and Green chili port stew. Atmosphere is really great and so is the service. Easy parking. This is one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Here for happy hour.  The drink menu looks tremendous.  I'd need to come here for a week (lunch and dinner) to try all the unique offerings.  Working my way through the small plates.....wow....fantastic!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant find this place is.  We had a variety of things.  The kids menu was good with burgers but the adult offerings were more than just the sow advertised.  I had the trio of the filet, duck and halibut.  My wife had the salmon.  We had the Brussels sprouts.  They were excellent.  

To top it off we had the beignets for desert and they were a favorite with the kids... And the adults!  Will be one of our mainstays."}
{"text":"Great food and great atmosphere! I am difficult to feed due to numerous allergies and sensitivities. Our waitress was attentive to all my restrictions and made sure that my order was safe for me to eat. The food was great for all in our party of four. Drinks and beer selection were creative and excellent. We would definitely eat here again when we're back in town!"}
{"text":"Yes, I am a FAN! 

Very Friendly staff from the moment we walked in the door. We did feel a little under dressed, after a day of shopping...however that did not stop us. The decor is nice and the food was amazing. I would highly recommend trying this spot out. 
We enjoyed it and will be back for another meal and some more drinks."}
{"text":"The service and food, drinks were great! We planned our visit to take advantage of happy hour. I had the deviled eggs and pork taco which fantastic and a great value. The rest of crew ordered off the menu. My wife's beef shoulder was top shelf. One of us ordered the flourless Chocolate cake which was one of best I have tasted in along time. We will be returning often."}
{"text":"They make some great duck fat fries! Overall a very enjoyable experience. Good food and good (strong) drinks. The place gets really loud but other than that it is a great place to unwind after the work week."}
{"text":"Been here many times since. Definitely really rich and decadent food, but I've also found stuff that is just downright delicious. The pork tacos (only available during happy hour) are amazing. So is the honey dipped fried chicken (also only available during happy hour). The butterscotch budino changed my life, and I will be really sad when they don't have it anymore. It's worth noting that Tuesday's happy hour is available al night and is therefore my favorite time to go."}
{"text":"The Hubby and I were able to come for dinner last night, and we enjoyed it.  We started with the duck fat fries with the egg and Bearnaise, it was very very good.  The Bearnaise was very tarragon flavored, which I liked.  I had the crispy chicken thighs the Hubby had a burger and we both enjoyed our meals.  I appreciate well seasoned food, but my meal was over salted a bit too much.  Other than that, it tasted great.  The fingerlings were awesome and the chicken skin was sooo crisp, very good!  I liked that the use of fresh herbs stood out, but didn't take over.  We finished with the creme brulee and it was also very good, thick rich custard, smooth, perfect."}
{"text":"This is a great spot, especially the atmosphere, fun and open and the food is solid. We will be back for sure"}
{"text":"I finally made it back to Salty Sow...thanks to a BOGO mailer that I received.  Once I got the mailer, I hopped on OpenTable and made a reservation and went in for a late lunch.  The fact that a place uses OpenTable gives it a little boost in my book.

The waitress was very welcoming and friendly and did a great job explaining the menu and concept and welcoming me back.  I ordered the slow-roasted beef shoulder and was not disappointed.  The root vegetables in the dish were perfectly cooked.  I ordered their version of a Moscow mule and enjoyed it.  I'm glad I tried the restaurant again because I was pleased with the meal.  I don't know that it will become a regular place for me to dine, but I wouldn't be averse to going back if someone suggests it.  I'd be even more tempted to go if I received another BOGO mailer...."}
{"text":"We have been going to this establishment since they first opened years ago.  A great date /special occasion spot  with a good sized bar and a southern ambiance(dim lights). I did have my usual Moscow mule drink, complimented with there specialty deviled eggs as a starter. I always go pork with my mail meal. This time I had the pork shoulder, which is like a beef stew meal that is mixed with carrots, potatoes, etc."}
{"text":"Came here for restaurant week last week and we were blown away at how delicious everything was. We sat outside on a perfect phoenix night and had the friendliest waiter, whose name I unfortunately cannot remember. We had a brussle sprout caesar salad that I wish was on every menu everywhere, I would eat a lot more salads, that is for sure! We had porkchops for the main course which were awesome but the highlight was the dessert. We were so full when we left and cannot wait to go back and try what else they have"}
{"text":"Sean was one of the best waiters I have had in a long time. Not to mention the food was phenomenal!!! I can't wait til my trip to Austin so I can visit the salty sow again. Awesome night!"}
{"text":"We are locals and were looking for a new locally owned place to try.  We ended up here.  It was okay. It was too noisy. Our waiter was very helpful and upbeat.  The food was okay - but nothing to rave about.  We probably won't come back."}
{"text":"Everything here is AMAZING elegant elevated southern comfort food. And the BEST drinks. Come for happy hour!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I am going there twice this week !! Whenever I have guests I take them there because of unique menu and good food"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. We stopped in for lunch and was pleasantly surprised on this place. It's a very nice atmosphere, a quiet lunch spot. The menu was crazy, I saw 5-6 things I wanted to try. I went with the pork shoulder, it was some of the best pork I've had in a long time. I will definitely be coming back, it was very affordable too, $12 lunch specials."}
{"text":"My family and I had dinner at the Salty Sow on August 15, 2015.  Our reservations were for 6:30 pm and we were seated promptly.  The restaurant is bigger on the inside than it looks.  The table/seating was comfortable and roomy.  The ambiance was great and even the background music enjoyable and not overly loud.

The happy hour was certainly happy. The Top Shelf drinks were indeed top shelf and smooth.  We tried the chorizo stuffed mushrooms, pork belly, deviled eggs, honey rosemary chicken, chili duck fat fried fries and green chili pork.  All were amazing!

For the entrees we had two of the mixed grills and hanger steak plates.  The mixed grill consisted of a bone-in fillet, crispy fried chicken thigh and pork belly with smashed potatoes.  The hanger streak included green onion mashed potatoes.  All three plates were seasoned, cooked and plated to perfection.  Chef Brandon turned out a wonderful meal, perfectly timed.

Michael was our waiter and was excellent.  He was friendly without being intrusive, knowledgeable on all of the specialty drinks and menu items.  He seemed to know what we wanted or needed before we asked.

Whenever you have a restaurant that hits the mark on all counts, you have a winner.  The prices were reasonable and the portions were perfect  for a hearty appetite.  I will be back and I certainly will recommend it to family and friends."}
{"text":"Epic! Happy Hour on Sunday. Prochetta special. Great chef and server.  It has been forever since seeing a menu this good and tasting food this great. Five entrées, 3 appetizers, 4 desserts. Their craft beer selection was $2 off during happy hour."}
{"text":"Wonderful tasty food and attentive service, what more could you ask for?  My friend and I caught happy hour, and were able to get a couple cocktails.  Both were great, mine has a block cube of ice in it with a couple herbs in the cube.  Loved it, it's the little touches.  I ordered the pork filet minion and my bestie had a burger and fries.  Mine was excellent and also had a squash compote which was yummy, but that was it. It's ala carte if you want a second side.  Both entrees were yummy.  We both got desserts and mine actually was the highlight, it was the salted caramel dessert.  It tasted just like Wurthers candies like at grandpas but even better.  My friend had the gluten free chocolate. Oh la la, yummo.  Service informative, attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Everyone likes it.  I did not, overpriced and food was just ok.  Food was good but nothing special."}
{"text":"Possibly my favorite place in town. Salty sow checks all the boxes. Great food, service, happy hour, and nightly specials. Glen, Kendra, and Tony are fantastic bartenders. Not quite sure why there are any negative reviews. Their rewards program is the beez knees  $5 for every $50 spent!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome for happy hour. I DEFINITELY want to come back ASAP! Great beer selection great service. Great atmosphere. AMAAAAAAZING appetizers. 

Get the duck fat fries FOR SURE. 
The deviled eggs were the best I've ever had. 
The meats and cheese platter = YUM
Not a big brussels sprouts guy but those were awesome too. 

Long story short ... I can't wait to go there and try their entrees!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite spots to eat. Prime rib is like none other, charcuterie board rocked our socks (Jason even ate the pate!) and of course we ALWAYS get the beet salad with goat cheese and pistachio. My bubbly and Jason's beer was just enough to wash it all down with one last sip. PS- Thank you for having bone marrow on the menu."}
{"text":"Great customer service. The food is different which is great, but the taste was okay."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat and have some refreshing drinks! Always awesome service and food!!"}
{"text":"Food was great. I would recommend this place for drinks during happy hour. The mules were perfect. I would suggest passing on their happy hour food, it was slightly over priced for what they give you. Dinner, however, is totally worth it!!"}
{"text":"The food is good , but the few times I have been there,  every time ,we were ignored and had to ask for a waitress or waiter  to service our table . Very upsetting. I don't know what the deal is. You would think with the high prices and the really good food, that they  would  make  an effort to give great service! I will go somewhere else next time!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Tried the French Dip sandwich. It is great! Our waiter Tony is awesome, very helpful and knowledgable about the menu. I usually get the pork ragout, but decided to expand my horizons."}
{"text":"If you are looking for traditional BBQ this is not the place for you. All dishes have an interesting twist to them and I was leery of trying them out. The atmosphere is good and the wait staff friendly, I just expected more familiar foods"}
{"text":"The Salty Sow is much more then a BBQ joint.  We came here thinking we were going to have franchise BBQ, but once we looked over the menu, we could tell we were going to get much more. 

We started with cocktails and the Duck Fat Fries. The Salty Sow Martini with cream cheese and bacon stuffed olives. Awesome. Duck Fat Fries, I don't have to say how good they were. I had the Braised Beef Shoulder . The flavors were great and very tender. The other dishes at the table were the Pork Belly, Halibut, and Roasted Pork Shoulder. Everyone loved their meals. Maybe...the best meal of the trip. I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is amazing and the atmosphere is great. Duck Fat Fries are the way to go."}
{"text":"Just LOVE this place.  There appie are amazing. All night happy hour Monday and Tuesday night.  Prime rib.  To die for   Check it out"}
{"text":"Service and food are great.   No matter what you order they want you happy.  They are now open for lunch and Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"Oh beef shoulder I could eat 3 of you in one sitting... Seriously the best item on their menu is the beef shoulder and it is delicious and with an egg on top and mashed potatoes on the bottom it makes for an awesome sandwich type of thing. The service here is good, the charcuterie plate is tasty; and the truffled deviled eggs are also one of their best appetizers (tasted a bit garlicky and trufflely at the same time). My friends ordered the lamb burger and the French dip and the French dip was better than the lamb burger. Also for sides just get smashed fried potatoes which is like a bastard child of mashed potatoes and French fries... A delicious bastard child. The service was awesome and our waitress Bethany was attentive and extremely friendly."}
{"text":"Why, oh why, did we wait a whole year into moving here before trying out this place? You mean we could have been eating here for a WHOLE year by now?? Well, on the up side we did end up eating here and fell in love. We were directed this way via Yelp (of course) and the high volume of positive reviews - which obviously weren't lyin'. 

Knowing we wanted to try somewhere new, and diligently trying to check places off of our ever growing \"bookmark\" lists, this place popped up since we were at the Paradise Valley Mall, which is conveniently right across the street. Parked the car, and headed around the corner to the front entry way. 

Once inside the place oozed ambiance and the decor went from classy, high-end styled seats, to folksy art pig paintings on the wall and Edison-esque lighting. We  were ushered to a half booth, half high-top table spot close to the bar and our waitress (and her amazing trainee for the evening) greeted us pretty instantly. Menus were handed over and briefly explained. We were lucky enough to hit them for happy hour - which is seven, yes SEVEN, days a week! Whoo! That's a big win for us since during the work week it's difficult for me to get out of work in time for most happy hour offerings.

When our waitress and trainee returned to the table, we explained that we were total noobs to this whole gig and she quickly offered up suggestions from apps, to drinks, to happy hour \"must-try\" small bites. We opted for the truffled deviled eggs app, my drink was the The Petey, his was a standard rum and coke, a so-called \"small\" plate of honey rosemary dipped fried chicken, a spit-roasted pork taco, and finally, a beef shoulder taco...all of the food was on the $5/each happy hour menu! I mean...it's $5...

Eggs = holy cow, best deviled eggs...ever. The salty-bacon bits inside of the delectable truffle mix filling was unreal good. My drink came as a recommendation from the waitress and it was an amazing blend of refreshing citrus and mint along with a touch of tart grapefruit vodka and agave. The fried chicken and tacos, while supposedly \"small\" plates, were full on meals in and of themselves. The chicken was two full-sized large tenders smothered in what I can only say is honey sauce from heaven. The tacos were stuffed to the brim with meat and toppings. The pork and steak were done perfectly and the toppings, while plentiful, weren't added on to the point of being distracting from the meat, which is the point of a taco...am I right??

Finally - and go ahead and judge our gluttony here, cause we are totally NOT regretful at all on this - we had TWO desserts, cause, we really honestly could not decide on just one. We went for the bananas foster beignets and the truffle chocolate cake. Seriously tell me you could pick just one of those...go ahead...I'll wait....

Once they arrived, we did for half of a second regret ordering two cause these babies were ginormous offerings of dessert, for an extremely reasonable price point. The chocolate was my fave, but I'm a chocolate lover. That being said, if we had only ordered the banana dessert, I would have been completely happy.

Overall: A+
A-wait for it-mazing food. Great service from start to finish. Strong drinks. Happy hour ALL week long with great prices. BAM! We'll be back, no question there."}
{"text":"This bistro is all about \"Slow Cookin'\" but not all about pork, with an interesting menu covering a nice variety of dishes. Our visit was for lunch, and recommend the guacamole appetizer, while not a large portion, it had an interesting flavor. My salad was introduced as Brussel Sprouts, which were crispy individual leaves throughout 3 kinds of lettuce, and a tasty dressing. I discovered midway through that the cranberry, candied almonds, shredded Parmesan and garlic were nested in the bottom of the bowl. Delicious! Located near the Paradise Valley Mall."}
{"text":"This restaurant impressed me so much for dinner that I came for happy hour a week later. On our first visit, our server, Mason was great - extremely friendly and attentive! 

The restaurant was busy and had so much energy! My fubby and I ordered white sangrias and it was amazing! I highly recommend especially since drinking half the glass, I was already feeling the alcohol! I loved their Brussels sprouts and lamb burger! They were so delicious! We also ordered the duck fries - the lamb burger included fries so I regretted ordering the duck fries because we couldn't even devour half of the fries! It was truly a waste. The duck fries were good, but I wouldn't order them again. Even though they were \"duck\" fries, they were just fries to me with an egg on top - big whoop. The bill came close to $50 which isn't cheap but I noticed they have happy hour so I knew I would be back!

A week later, we couldn't stop thinking about Salty Sow. Very little do we go to a new place and we like it enough to add to our restaurant list. Congrats Salty, you made it to our list! 

We decided to try their happy hour and only ordered happy hour items - it was a big mistake but at least the next time, I know better. We didn't order the lamb burger because it wasn't on the hh menu. Instead, we ordered the Brussels, carnitas taco, fried chicken, chorizo stuffed mushrooms, the eggplant fritters, the catfish taco, and I got a Sedona Sunset drink. 

My drink was way too strong that I only managed to get in a few sips. The tacos were $5 each - I mean one big taco for $5 and this is a happy hour price! They were ok but I wouldn't order these again - not for that price. The chorizo stuffed mushrooms again were flavorful but I wasn't a big fan. The fried chicken was good but wouldn't come back just for their fried chicken. And the eggplant fritters was just that - fried eggplant. Our server, Kayla, wasn't that attentive either. She took forever to check on us and give us our check and I don't think the restaurant was more busy than the last time we were there. The check totaled $50.

My lesson: come back and order the Brussels and lamb burger - and a white sangria and if I come during happy hour, stick with that order and the check will be a few dollars cheaper because of the Brussels and sangria!"}
{"text":"I thought most of the food was disappointing... although it seems to be popular place. It was very expensive for the portion sizes - and food was unremarkable.  Guacamole was $9 and amount was small and chips were stale.  One of us got Fried chicken but it was pan fried, not deep fried and it was tough. One person got the burger and liked it ...And the cheddar grits were good. I had fish and chips, fish was greasy and over breaded.  Won't go back."}
{"text":"Great brunch, fun atmosphere! Southern style at its best...chicken and waffles are amazing, nice fresh warm tortillas with pork and green chili sauce, lots of fresh berries, pastries where okay-didn't seem fresh made, bacon was tasty but had to hunt because a lot was charred, and the service was good. Overall great brunch for the price, wish drinks were included. Worth the visit!"}
{"text":"This place has some pretty delicious stuff.  I've never had a lamb burger and it wasn't disappointing.  The porcini sandwich was well balanced in flavor.  The Duck Fat Fries with 110 minute egg is delicious!! This place takes time and effort to prepare a savory meal.  Especially around the pv area you'd have to drive pretty far for this kinda food. 

On our second visit here for lunch we had pork tacos, turkey sandwich, a burger and the chicken. The burger was very juicy and very filling. Since there was no kids menu we had to get the chicken and potato's for my 2 year old but she ate it and loved it (not the entire two pieces of chicken but almost 1 whole one on her own). the tacos and sandwich were great as well. for 4 of us we paid less ten $60 for lunch, not bad considering other places we have eaten and we spend over $60 for 3 people but i guess a little pricey considering it was lunch"}
{"text":"I was able to have dinner here Saturday night with our group. We had different waiters change hands in the middle of our order, and they ended up forgetting our appetizers. The waitress was very apologetic, and Doug, the manager, came out and told us he would take care of our deserts due to the miscommunication. Very professional and the food was outstanding. I had the Halibut, and it was awesome for not being in Alaska. Recommend these guys for a solid dinner if you thinking about trying them out!"}
{"text":"This place is less than 5 minutes from my house. We love it! Never had a bad experience and we've been many times. Mostly go for food - but they do have good drinks as well. Very consistent, which to me is the most important piece to being a good restaurant. The brunch they just started serving is great and an amazing deal."}
{"text":"Large, open space with outdoor patio. We like to come here for happy hour appetizers and drinks. Brussels sprout leaves, honey rosemary chicken, and pork belly tacos are a must."}
{"text":"Good food and great service.  Food was well made and good portions.   Ambience is very nice and seats are rather comfortable.   They have large share tables which are great for groups.   Definitely a great place for porc lovers!"}
{"text":"We called two weeks prior to Easter to get a reservation and was told there was a waiting list and we would be contacted. We called back 2 days beforehand and was told the list was cleared a week before and \"they made a error and missed us\" and we were basically out of luck. If you are going to take a waiting list, you should actually look at the list to see who to clear. We were very excited to try this restaurant but probably just going to take a pass at this point..."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The food is amazing and portion are perfect. Can't wait for mothers day brunch."}
{"text":"First time we went here we found a strange menu and tiny expensive weak drinks. Second time the service was not good so we left after spending $15 on 2 tiny weak drinks. Tried it again last night - we had a coupon for a free entree. $75 for a brussel sprout salad that was so tough it hurt my jaw - yes it was salad - halibut that was soggy & had a topping that tasted like bile, broccolini that was lukewarm & also tough, my boyfriends \"steak\" wasnt even steak it was roast beef & served in a cookpot instead of a normal plate. What the point of that was, was beyond us. That and 4 drinks. So for $75 we got a salad, one entree & 4 drinks. The atmosphere was the only thing we like about the place."}
{"text":"This place is a great value for the money. It's been a while since we were in, as we have been traveling, but my wife and I have been here probably 3-4 times now. The crispy chicken thighs (my personal favorite) are excellent and well-portioned. We look forward to returning here often."}
{"text":"Love the vibe of this place and a really great happy hour - 3 of us girls shared 5 $5 appetizers and drank $5 glasses of wine and we're happy campers. 

I love the decor - really elegant yet comfortable, and the lighting is pretty - a big factor for me :-) A great cocktail menu too. Definitely coming back, love this local spot."}
{"text":"Our anniversary upon us and decided to treat ourselves to a breakfast buffet. Not only was the price right at $19,95 (did NOT include coffee, though) but the food was good. The dessert bar was underwhelming and looked unappetizing.  The waitress takes your omelet order. Our omelets were good.  The breakfast potatoes need improvement as there weren't enough \"potatoes\" in it. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place and I would give it another go in hopes that small improvements can be made to make it 5 stars."}
{"text":"Fun cozy spot. Met a friend for a drink and was surprised how welcoming this spot was. You can see your food being prepared which is great. Lots of things to look at. Would return."}
{"text":"This place was wonderful! Went here with a party of four, everyone was treated well and pleased with their drinks and meals. The price was decent for being here during happy hour, too. 

The atmosphere is trendy and fresh. The seats were a little uncomfortable and we felt like we were sinking way lower than is comfortable to be at a table. That would be a nice update. 

We had deviled eggs, bacon caesar salad, pork belly, pork tacos, brussel sprouts, and more. Everything was done perfectly. Bon appetite!"}
{"text":"returned after several months after experiencing food poisoning
at this restaurant. service was very good. ordered the house salad that was so large, we split it. the pork filet mignon was just
okay. my spouse ordered the fried chicken and duck fat fries off
the early bird menu. large portion and the chicken was excellent.
will return again and hopefully not experience the digestive problems as i had in the past."}
{"text":"I came here with my wife and was pleasantly surprised. The vibe in here is excellent, the servers are very attentive and helpful and the food is delish. We ordered the duck fat fries to start and the fries were hot, the poached egg was perfect, and the Bernaise was great as well. I followed that up with the Prime Rib cooked medium rare and boy am I happy that I did. I'll definitely be back to explore more of the menu here. I also had 2 or 4 cocktails- they're perfectly balanced and delicious. Great restaurant with delicious food and drinks."}
{"text":"My first time visiting Salty Sow was for a dinner date. The atmosphere was nice but I did not care much for the menu/food. I tried the fried green tomatoes - meh. As for my entrée, it was also just okay. Not my personal preference of food.

The sole reason for this rating is for the dessert. I don't normally order desserts when dining but I did here because I did not eat much of my food and boy am I glad.The Banana Foster Beignets (excuse me as I wipe the drool from my mouth) are delicious!!!! So. Damn. Good. As I type this, I am having a sudden craving for it! Now, I frequent Salty Sows only for this dessert. I have even dined at the nearby restaurants and then called a take out order for these beignets. They are that good! Seriously, go get you some!"}
{"text":"Oh, their first restaurant was in Austin, Texas? I'm listening. 

Thorough execution is an understatement, this place is almost too on-point. 
For this type of restaurant, the decor is, to my eye, literally perfect. I think it's a shame this pro-eatery isn't located in a more centralized area of the city.

Starting out, the Bacon and Gruyère Crusted Bone Marrow was [expletive] incredible. Intensely indulgent and rich but small enough so as to not weigh you down (this is important to my shallow appetite). Although The Duck Fat Fries [110-minute egg, cold béarnaise] sounded stupendous to my grumbling belly, I decided to save my appetite for the main course. 

For an entre, I ordered the Pork Ragout. The soft polenta, basil oil, and parmesan were perfectly suited to each other and provided an excellent foundation for the rich tomato-y pork ragout. This isn't a huge dish, so I seriously considered licking my plate clean. 

My girlfriend ordered the Slow Cooked Beef Shoulder, substituting the mashed potato base for white corn cheese grits. A much larger dish, we both worked on this. The beef was tender, moist, and flavorful, the vegetables were cooked to perfection, and the fried egg on top had me at \"fried egg on top\". Homey and comforting American scrumptiousness. 

Cocktails: The Sparkling Sangria [elderflower liqueur, bubbles, lemon, orange, grapes, opal basil] was sweeter than I was expecting, but it was very refreshing and highly drinkable. The Zenjen [Bluecoat gin, Canton ginger liqueur, lavender syrup, lemon, rose bubbles] was fairly tasty, but leaned more toward the side of typical, although I must say it was a good stern mix. The drink prize of the night goes to the Curly Tail [Camarena tequila, cilantro, serrano, blood orange, smoked salted rim]. This was super delicious and unique, and also very strong. The ice cubes had jalapeno peppers frozen in, which was a wonderfully cool touch. 

If you like American gastro-pub style dishes, pork things, and other delicious land animal meats, this place is a must go."}
{"text":"Very good food. I had the slow cooked beef shoulder. It's served with a spoon and that's all you need. It was so tender and tasty.  My BF had the chicken thighs. Although not breaded they perfectly seared the skin and it was so full of flavor and crunchy. The atmosphere was great. The one thing we would suggest is serving bread before. We were starving and needed a pregame snack. Everything on the appetizer menu was a bit too heavy for what we were aiming for, but a little bread would have done the trick.  Overall a great experience!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have had dinner here a couple of times and loved it. The Sunday brunch was also an excellent meal. Last Monday, we took an out-of-town visitor to the SaltySow for dinner. It was outstanding! The appetizers were amazing and our server Mason was the perfect blend of attentive and unobtrusive. The Trout Almondine, Blackened Prime Rib Tacos and Porkchetta were excellent. Crime Brullet was the perfect cap for the meal. The food and service  never disappoints."}
{"text":"What I like about this place is it's uniqueness. Situated in a weird location between Walmart and Tilted Kilt you wouldn't expect an upscale place like this. That being said, since its upscale, beware it is pricey for sure. It can cost around $100 for 2 ppl b/c portions are small. The items I had were either hit or miss, but boy were the hits good. They try to order locally which is good and everything seemed really fresh. I had 4 peaks peach ale (which is delicious) and a pomegranite mixer drink that was also very refreshing and  tasty. We got their french fries which had eggs on top-good, but the tarragon dipping sauce was bad (like pine needles). I also had the braised pork with mashed potatoes -simply delicious with perfectly tender cooked meat. The salmon was also perfectly cooked with a nice crust on top, but I wasn't crazy about the sauce it came with -blah and fatty tasting. The desert (fried cheesecake and ice cream) was delicious, but not as unique as the rest of the meal I've had it at other places for less and just as good."}
{"text":"Second time here...loved our food and the service is wonderful!  Had the pork belly and the pork shoulder. Everything tasted fantastic. Make sure you take bites of the apple with the pork belly!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Decor: good. Service: great. Food: this is really the best you can do?

I went to Salty Sow during restaurant week. I was honestly pretty excited about my meal. I got a Copper State Mule to start (good, but not anything special - vodka, ginger beer, lime on ice). My first course was an endive salad. Pretty flavorless, except for the bleu cheese which overpowered everything. My second course was suckling pig topped with a fried egg. It was easily the most disappointing part of my meal. I don't know what part of the pig I was eating, but it was not appetizing. Some of it was chewy, some was tender (good), some of unrecognizable (not good at all). The fried egg added absolutely nothing to the dish. The steamed cabbage at the bottom of my plate lacked basic salt and pepper. For desert, I had homemade ricotta cheese that was topped with honey, dates, golden raisins, and cranberries with a side of toasted baguette. I'm all about simple deserts, but this, although good, did not wow me. Portion sizes were small and I felt like I was paying a lot for what I got (even at restaurant week prices). 

It may be a good place to grab a drink with friends, but as far as food goes, I think you'd have a much better meal elsewhere."}
{"text":"Such GREAT FRIED GREEN TOMATOS 
And the rest of the food is amazing too 
The staff is so sweet they held the door open for my 83 year old mother each time we went there"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!!!!  My boyfriend and I went here on a Wednesday evening for dinner and we were STARVING, we hadn't eaten since breakfast. The parking lot made it seem like they were packed but there was plenty of open seating when we walked in and we were seated promptly. We ordered a blood orange margarita topped with cider from the board menu for dinner my BF ordered the double Cheese burger and I ordered the hanger steak medium rare, it came with green onion mashed potatoes and zucchini. It took a little while to get our dinner but it wasn't too bad. When dinner arrived I first tried one of my BFs duck fat fries and mentioned it was cold, he said he got a hot one and was happy with it. I then tried a piece of steak, again it was cold, tried some potatoes and they were cold. They were so bad they had that \"shell\", if you will, that mashed potatoes get when they have been sitting too long. We grabbed our waitress and I told her my food was cold, she said \"oh...\" Grabbed my plate and walked away, no apology, no sincerity, no nothing. My BF was done with his burger by the time my re-fire came out, it was delivered by the manager who dropped the plate off and said that the plate was hot and to be careful, she walked away, again no apologies....  Well this time the food was hot but the steak was over cooked. We called over the manager and told her it was over cooked, it was almost like we had to convince her it wasn't cooked right, she just gave us these looks making us feel like idiots. She asked if it was hot this time and I said yes, she's like well at least we got half of it right this time. Walked away with my plate and there I waited yet again for my food.  She brought over my plate, third times a charm right?  WRONG!!!  The food was cold AGAIN!!!  The manager actually had the nerve to say that ordering a medium rare steak would result in a colder piece of meat...  My jaw almost dropped, I said I realize it's not going to be blazing hot but this isn't my first steak. I can order rare prime rib hotter than this steak, NOT to mention the potatoes were cold again and I tasted them hot on the 2nd plate they brought out. The manager asked if they could bring me something else, at this point I was so fed up I just said no, I don't want anything. She's like \"I don't want you to leave hungry\" we had been here over an hour and I wasn't going to wait any longer for a restaurant who obviously can't cook a steak or serve hot items. I just wanted to leave. She came back around and said she felt embarrassed and didn't know what was going on and said our meal (i.e. My BFs meal) was compensated and gave her card and said if we'd give them another chance to let her know next time we come. Well there won't be a next time. IMO if a the plate wasn't right the first time the manager should make damn sure its perfect the 2nd time, there should never EVER be a third or fourth time. ABSOLUTELY WORSE RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE EVER!"}
{"text":"After 4 years it's time for an updated review.  What started as one of our favorite spots has deteriorated over time.  At first I thought these were just one offs, but now I see trends.  

My last experience I walked in in the middle of the week at 7:30 and the place was maybe 1/3 full.  They also no longer have a daily special board to choose from and the overall menu selection seems to have shrunk.  Our brussel sprout Caesar was fairly flavorless and average at best.  My prime rib was quite good but my partner's pork belly was inedible.  When the waitress came by at the end of the meal and saw he hadn't eaten it she did offer to get him something else but at that point he just wanted to go.   No service recovery effort other than that.

Other meals lately have also been a mixed experience.  Amazing hot chicken sandwich and grisly filets at the same meal.  And again, no service recovery effort.  Note to management, when a server sees someone hasn't eaten their meal, check to see if there was an issue with the food.

I'm not giving up but I won't be taking business guests or friends here for dinner anymore."}
{"text":"Best place to go for happy hour, nice drinks and amazing food.  When the weather is nice, try getting their back outdoor patio.  The fireplace at  night is FANTASTIC!   

Their halibut is to die for and the brussel sprout appetizer is worth getting a thousand times over.."}
{"text":"$7 for a beer???
I'm sorry, but that is ridiculous! 
I was excited to see my favorite beer on tap, Four Peaks peach ale, but why pay $7 when I can go to four peaks and pay $4.50?
That being said, I was excited about the restaurant in general and I liked it.  It has a very cool vibe, which is lacking in the PV mall area, so this very much appreciated.  Also, all of the food we ordered was great!  We were there for happy hour and we did not get the tacos, I think they were $5 each for one small taco, that seems too pricey!  I think in the Phoenix/Scottsdale market, other similar restaurants are a little more competitive with their pricing.
Overall, I know I will be back, but maybe not as often since it is a little pricey.  I also agree with the other reviewer who said there should be a kids menu!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, creative menu and amazing food, all at reasonable prices.
Don't skip the deviled eggs and always start with the charcuterie board. The cheeses they source are amazing. 
Love that the wine list is full of reasonably priced wines"}
{"text":"It was ok, not sure I'd go back anytime soon. The fried green tomato was exactly 3 tiny slices. Too small. The mushrooms were a few tiny bites in an escargot plate, also tiny. Duck fat fries ok, nothing special.
The worst was my pork belly-- hard, dry, chewy chunk of lard. The salad with it was tasteless. The corn meal mush was lumpy. It really was a let down. My friends dishes seemed better. 
If I go again, (not likely), I would try the fillet mignon but I don't see that happening anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. We went with a large party around 9PM after a late flight into town. The restaurant was not that busy, but it still took awhile to get waters or drinks. I had to ask the hostess to call out waitress. We ordered drinks and the deviled eggs, duckfat fries and the guacamole. The drinks were very good and the appetizers were wonderful.
My party ordered the roast pork shoulder, halibut, double cheeseburgers and I ordered the pork belly. 
They loved their food and wanted to come back to the restaurant. The only disappointment was the
Pork belly. The pork belly I've had at other restaurants is juicy, charred and delicious. The pork belly at the Sow, was very dry. The flavor was ok, but the meat itself was dry and no fat at all. I will definately go back here whenever I come back to try the other dishes. The menu is very enticing..."}
{"text":"Came here and had a delicious dinner, served by Kelly.  She is a sweetheart and is great at her job! She suggested the Blanche margarita which was fantastic. %100 recommend! ( I also suggest the rotisserie roasted pork, I have it every time)"}
{"text":"We've been here twice now and have had only the most positive experiences. 

For starters, our waiter, Michael, remembered us from our first visit ten months earlier. He's definitely a huge asset to this place. He was very attentive, gave us great honest suggestions, and is an overall pleasant person. 

The food is also fantastic. It's clearly high quality and well prepared. There's nothing that we've had that we wouldn't have again."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Salty Sow with our 5 year old son tonight (by the way, its not meant for kids but mine loved the food anyway).  I'll open with the fact that I have absolutely nothing negative to say, so you don't have to wait to find out if there's a gripe in this review!  :)

The food is amazing!  We had the duck fries as an appetizer, and the three of us couldn't stop eating them.  Next I had the Green Chile Pork Stew (which as actually an appetizer, but it made a meal).  I loved it and the portion was so generous I brought some home.  My husband had the Slow Cooked Beef Shoulder.   We had this dish last time we were there and once again it was perfect and he cleaned the dish!  We got the Crisp Chicken Thighs for my son, and hands down that's the best chicken I've ever eaten in my life.  Obviously a five year old didn't finish it, and I'm looking forward to having it left over.  For dessert, we had the Banana's Foster, which was just delicious.  It was another very generous portion that we finished because we couldn't stop.

Our waiter's name was Sean and he made this (very infrequent) night out as great as I could have hoped.  His level of service was stellar.  He was friendly, funny, very helpful, and efficient.  I really felt like our experience was important to him.  I also encountered other staff who either brought out food or just checked on us, and their professionalism was just as impressive.  During our visit, a man and a woman who were obviously managers stopped by to make sure we were enjoying ourselves, and the lady manager even went out of her way to suggest I could have more tortillas to go with my stew, and brought them back to me herself.  

Start to finish, this experience was excellent.  The food and portions were appropriate for the price we paid, and I left happy.  Highly recommended to ANYONE.  

Thank you all for a great night with my family!"}
{"text":"The Brussel Sprout Salad is TO DIE FOR! Yummmmmmmy! We also really enjoy the green chili stew! They are so delish that we've never actually tried anything else on the menu because we are so in love with both options! The green Chile stew is spicy, and always fresh! It comes with a few warm tortillas that are amazing too! My mom had a bean burger there I believe- she said it was really great as well!"}
{"text":"The food was very good and our server Michael was very engaging. A fun place to have dinner."}
{"text":"The service was great!  We sat down immediately despite being a half hour early for our reservation.  The waiter was extremely friendly and made great recommendations.  We got there while happy hour was still going on and ordered a zillion things off of that menu.  They had $5 drinks, $5 appetizers, and $6 and $7 small plates.  We got all of the tacos, the deviled eggs, the stuffed mushrooms and the Brussel sprouts and everything was delicious.  The bananas foster beignets were out of this world. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I dined here with my folks for the first time and WOW!!! The food was phenomenal, and the atmosphere was super warm and welcoming. 

Our waiter, Michael blew my mind, too. Hands down best service we've ever had - and I spent 5+ years waiting tables, so that's saying a lot. His recommendations were genuine and spot on - the stuffed mushrooms and lemon sole were to die for.

Our only complaint? There are so many delicious dishes to chose from, that it was really difficult to decide on one!!

We will be back for their one-of-a-kind menu, and of course, Michael's exceptional service."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd visit to Salty Sow and looking back through things, it has been 3 years since last time I was here.   I will not wait so long next time.  Great grub, great drinks, great atmosphere, great service.  Simple.   Check it out."}
{"text":"We were welcomed and seated immediately by a sweet hostess. The only reason I am knocking a star off is that our waitress Amber greeted us smelling like an ashtray, she must have just come in from smoking a cigarette & then tried to cover it up with horrible perfume. Other than that our experience was perfect. Ordered 3 small plates from the happy hour menu glass of wine for me and beer for the hubby, all was fantastic. Drinks came out quick followed by the food."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic!  3 of us went to the Salty Sow for the first time tonight. All of us thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere, and especially the food. I had the French dip and it was phenomenal! All 3 of us are definitely looking forward to returning again. Hopefully very soon. The bun on my perfect roast beef was light, fluffy, and delicious. The perfect compliment."}
{"text":"I think I am in hog heaven. The sunday brunch has a wide assortments to choose from. The porchetta is spectacular.  The pork skin is nice and crispy.  The bloody Mary bar had candied bacon and assorted olives and pickle vegetables, I had it with clamato.Five stars in my book."}
{"text":"Shout out to Salty Sow for an amazing experience.  My colleagues and I met up for happy hour here and we left feeling satisfied with the amazing food and great service. 

Service-  Amazing and attentive service! I wish I could remember the individuals name who provided service but he was very easy going, gave great recommendations and kept the refills going of both water and drinks.  

Food- All around amazing. All of the dishes were fantastic.  
Truffled Deviled Eggs- If you like deviled eggs make sure to get them... If you don't like deviled eggs.. Get them! You will love them.
Duck Fat Fries- Duck Fat and Fries.... Nothing else really needs to be said.  
Honey Rosemary Dipped Fried Chicken- Man ol man.  This dish was phenomenal.  The chicken is very well done and biscuit.. perfect. 
French Dip-Roated Rare- If you enjoy the combo of prime rib, horseradish and au ju then you will love this meal.  Perfect spice, and flavors. 
White Corn Cheese Grits-  Great side dish.  Big enough to share with quite a few.
Fried Green Tomatoes-  Solid sharing dish for those who want to be semi Healthy

Drinks- All were great! Between the 3 of us we tried the Maple Glazed Old Fashion, Little Larry, Copper State Mule, Mr Shaw and the Petey.  I would have to give the nod to the Mr. Shaw.

Atmosphere-  Lively, busy, fun and slightly loud when it picks up.  Comfortable seating, great lighting, anything and everything you could ask for. 

This may become my new happy hour spot."}
{"text":"I finally got over there with my husband this evening (having been there for lunch with a friend).  We were there with 30 mins left on happy hour so we we enjoyed the triple fried duck fat fried with a fried egg and cold bernaise, and the goat cheese fritters and a couple of drinks.  I had (on friend and server recommendation) the blood orange frozen margarita, which was pretty sour and not very orangey.  The glass of wine I had next was great.
My husband had the slow cooked beef shoulder,and he said it was delicious (like a fantastic pot roast). I had the pork belly which was tender and sweet, and we split the Brussels sprout Caesar salad.  I am not a fan of citrus and there was a significant amount of lemon on the salad so I will make a point next time to ask for that to be left off.  And then because we hadn't eaten enough we had the Bananas Foster Beignets.  They were delicious.
5 drinks, 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, 1 salad, 1 desert before tax and tip was $81. Not bad.
We will be back!"}
{"text":"The burgers we had were good,  and the frys were amazing! We came for dinner on a weekend,  so it was pretty busy and loud,  but the service was still good."}
{"text":"Went during happy hour and had $2 off drinks and $5 apps.  Nice for our bill.  We all enjoyed our dinners.  French dip was incredibly tender.  Pork ragout over polenta was great.  Brussel sprout caesar salad was really different, but good as well.  The lamb burger was good, but not cooked as ordered, so it was dry.  We recommend you order rare if you want medium rare.  If we're in the area, we'll return.  It's a 50 minute drive for us, but I've wanted to try the Salty Sow for a year now."}
{"text":"Great new find around PV mall!  Finally a place that is new and interesting. Awesome patio!  We will be back for sure! Happy hour from 4:30-6:30pm, $5 beers and bites. Cute place and good food!"}
{"text":"Try it! ...OK - We go out to eat a great deal. Phoenix, Scottsdale Az. area. My wife has a co-worker who had a good experience @ The Salty Sow. I do not eat Red meat or Pork. So, just by the name I was skeptical. My wife likes Pork and steak. On 07-12-13 we drove to the 48th and Cactus location. Walked in and had to sit @ the bar for a drink and then they seated us in a booth. While at the bar we commented on the fact, that as it is set up, it allows for a loud dining environment. They were busy. Friday night. We were seated, waited quite a long time before waiter came to the booth. He just finished w/ a group of 18. Manager ( Beth ) came to the booth and apologized for the delay. Very nice and pleasant, asked if we wanted an appetizer. We were going to order one, we took her suggestion and then she stated it was on the house. A nice gesture (peace offering). Made us feel more comfortable. We ate appetizer, it was very good. Our waiter was outstanding - the entree came and it was wonderful. My wife always orders red meat, I order chicken,or fish. 85% of the time my meal is cold, the timing is off and my meal sets under a light. \"Both\" meals were great and I was happy. There were 2 managers - male & female. Both came to the table to insure  fast service. They hit a home run with me. Let me say - that is very unusual for a restaurant that busy and that price point to do. Exception all around effort. It is an open kitchen / full view."}
{"text":"My husband took me here for Mother's Day last year. It was a nice atmosphere. My only complaint was that it was pretty loud. We will probably try it again at some point when it's not a holiday."}
{"text":"This place has it figured out.  If you have an energetic restaurant with good service and great food, people will leave with happy full bellies.  A true gem!"}
{"text":"The charcuterie board was way on point.. And the Pork Prime Rib was absolutely fantastic.. Ill give em five when they get a kids menu rolling.."}
{"text":"Service from Lauren was excellent!  Michael stopped by and was very friendly and made us feel like we were his only guests. Green chili pork is amazing, fish and chips were excellent and the French dip was also very good.  The fries could have been a bit crispier. Great value and the wine was excellent. Will come back!"}
{"text":"I was out here on business and loved the restaurant so much, I ate here twice! I have eaten a lot of seafood, and have to say the Halibut is as Guy Fiorertti"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and reasonably priced. They had a solid menu of regular items that all sounded good. The specials were awesome.

I had chorizo stuffed mushrooms. They had the perfect level of spice. It comes with some crispy bread, dip it in the butter they cook the mushrooms in and its great. I had pineapple upside down cake that was phenomenal. The pineapple was fresh and plenty of crispy caramelized cake with some nice vanilla ice cream. 

The prices are really good for as good a product as they put out. A+++ great drinks too. Had the margarita with Chambord and it was so good and so refreshing.

Great place for adults probably not great for little kids but the food and drink are tops."}
{"text":"We had a fabulous dinner tonight and everyone loved their meal. Then we finished with the apple foster beanets. We will be back !!!"}
{"text":"During October 2017 lunch is BOGO. We split the double cheese burger and Salty Sow French Dip. The French Dip was double rare and completely tasteless. There wasn't even a hint of the horseradish sauce, which I love with this entree. The cheeseburger gave me Whopper indigestion. The duck fat fries were good, but I couldn't detect the duck fat. Maybe some of my well worn taste buds are as dead as Jacob Marley. One star for ambiance, one star for service and one star for value. It's definitely worth trying with the BOGO lunch. We may return and try 2 other entrees."}
{"text":"Food was great!!  Would have given full stars but service was terrible.  Table was dirty whole service it's to bad."}
{"text":"Hmmmm....salty pig parts. 

This place is great.  I wish it was on my side of town because I would be a frequent guest.  From the nice beer selection to the solid happy hour specials to the delicious dinner entrees I never encountered anything I'd change (high praise from an egomanic).  The bacon (pork belly) and eggs was especially good as were the tacos.  If you're in the northern part of Phoenix/Scottsdale you should swing by here soon and give it a try...unless you don't eat pork.  If that's the case, why are you reading reviews of a place called the \"Salty Sow\"???"}
{"text":"Rude bartender. My friend and I stop in for drinks at the bar regularly. They used to have a nice guy bartend the front. Lately it's a girl who is not the nicest. She has a bad attitude and never smiles. We go in a lot and she pretends like she's never seen us before.  Think her name is Jessica?

Manager kinda walks around but doesn't acknowledge customers or ask how their evening is going. 

Not a happy atmosphere. Food is good, drinks are good. I will say though, their Moscow Mules are not that good. I get a better buzz off the ones at Oreganos and they are also cheaper. 

Encountered an extremely creepy man at the bar. He was harassing my friend and I a few months ago and the bartender girl told us to be nice to him because he is a regular. Extremely inappropriate. He tried to assault someone in the parking lot that evening. As a customer I felt completely infuriated that she would tell us to be nicer to him when he was harassing us by being inappropriate, making a scene, and making us look bad by association since the bartender asked us to be nice to him. It was super uncomfortable after that. We soon closed out our tab and never went back."}
{"text":"Ok not a good choice for a date. Not a good place for anyone looking for decent food.  My bf and I ordered a 9$ app, Of guacamole and were served one very tiny tiny ice cream scoop of guacamole. I didn't even get to have any because it was enough for a mouse. There were so many chips it was hiding most of the gauc.  Server didn't know anything about the menu food or drinks. I order a drink and I asked if it would be to spicy, he had no clue, when the drink came, it was so spicy I had to swap drinks with my bf, oh and the pork chops were so dry could barely chew it. Just not a great menu, deff not organic . Sorry peeps"}
{"text":"MMMM delicious.

Had the 10oz Lamb burger. I love how it wasn't purely ground, but more like pulled lamb? Not sure if that is how lamb comes out when it is ground or if it really was. Anyways this burger was amazing. Perfectly Juicy, meat to bun, perfect. cheese to meat perfect.
Fries...thats what stopped a five star. They were good, but couldn't line up to the rest of the food we had. (a little bit of a let down)

My wife had the beef shoulder. It was served in its own pan. We loved the aesthetic that  added to our dining experience. The servers were knowledgeable and had the perfect balance of visiting your table and letting you eat.

I will come back to salty sow for SURE!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant and I can't wait to go back. My husband and I have been here three times now and every time has been fantastic. The first time we went was during Restaurant Week. This was amazing as we got to try a lot of items we normally might not try and found some favorites.

My favorite item on the menu has got to be their rosemary chicken with honey. I have ordered it every time we've gone and every time it has been delicious. The batter is crispy and the chicken is tender. The flavors, oh the flavors. It's a little salty but also sweet from the honey. Then there's the gravy and the sweet potato biscuit. Mm. Just thinking about it makes me crave it! 

My husband loved their steak - crisp outside and perfectly medium-rare inside. It comes with shoestring fries - which aren't my favorite but you can substitute any of the other sides. I've tried the cheese grits and the smashed potatoes. Both were delicious. (I'd highly recommend the smashed potatoes.)

We've tried a few of their appetizers. My favorite is the fried green tomatoes with guacamole. The guacamole is spicy and perfectly paired with the tomatoes. Additionally, we've tried the duck fat fries (fries are delicious), the bacon and gruyere crusted bone marrow (my husband really liked this), and the green chili pork stew - amazing. The stew is something I'd definitely recommend - either as an entrée or to share. There is plenty! 

We've tried two desserts - a Butterscotch pudding and a dark chocolate pudding with whipped cream. Both were delicious and I'd like to try more of their desserts. 

Every night they have a special menu specific for that night only. Usually there is something that sounds amazing and I have to have it. Additionally, they have Happy Hour every day from 4-6:30pm and then all night on Tuesdays. 

If you are ever in the area, definitely check it out! Otherwise, make a special trip because it is just that good."}
{"text":"Solid food, great service, and a good selection of local beers on tap. The duck fat fries, crispy Brussels sprouts leaves, eggplant frites, bacon and eggs, collard greens, cauliflower casserole, and salmon BLT are all worth eating again, and the butterscotch budino is fantastic. Now if they can only improve the bourbon selection a little bit..."}
{"text":"Okay happy hour, had a band which was good but it kind of finished after about 5 songs?!"}
{"text":"Great Brunch and it wasn't too busy at all. We enjoyed practically every dish they put out and nothing really went empty all morning. Great atmosphere and it's even okay to have a young child there, ours was nearing one and she did fine. The drinks are crafty and great, and the food was not just basic buffet breakfast from anywhere. I would recommend this to a friend for sure!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places ever! I have never had anything I didn't like and the happy hour is amazing! If you haven't been I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Yelp didn't let me down with this one.   The food was amazing.  The green chili dish for starters will knock your socks off.  Did a pork dish for main dish and it was outstanding.  For a dessert try the banana foster beignets and you will be happy."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for happy hour and had a great time. We were seated at the bar right in front of the open kitchen. The kitchen staff were all having a good time and it provided entertainment for us! We ordered off the happy hour menu. We got stuffed mushrooms, duck fat fries with a fried egg on top, fried chicken, and a pork taco. I got a margarita. I think it all cost about $40 with tip which is great for how nice the restaurant and food is. You could see them making everything from scratch in the kitchen."}
{"text":"I can't even describe how great this experience was! The review is a little late, but they deserve the 4 stars. I'd give it 5, but the service isn't great. The food came out very quickly and was delicious, but the waitress was not very kind or attentive. But hey, that just gave my husband and I some quality time, haha! But deriously, the food is very well-made and we were in and out of there (fully satisfied) in less than 45 minutes, which was perfect because we went to the movies afterward. Definitely a good experience overall. And hey, maybe our waitress was just having an off day, you never know!"}
{"text":"My son and I struggled to find something that appealed to us on the menu. I ordered the steak salad special. The steak portion was generous and perfectly cooked. The salad bowl appeared a little small, but was actually a very filling portion. I wasn't crazy about the chipotle dressing that the salad was mixed in. My son ordered the crispy chicken sandwich. He was told they sandwich was hot and the would prepare a milder version for him. It was still a little too hot for him. He really liked the fries in duck fat. Cool decor. Friendly waitress.Saturday Happy Hour until 6:30pm."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night to celebrate my friends birthday.   Went a little after the dinner rush and got right in.

We were greeted by a very laid back but full of personality guy named Michael.  He was a fantastic server and had his own little way of doing things that was great and very comfortable, you never felt rushed and he always made sure you were satisfied.

My wife ordered one of the specials for the night, the bolognese pasta.  It was made with San Marzano tomatoes and had creamy mozzarella melted on top of it.  Delicious.

The birthday boy had the pork belly entree.  Served with corn cheese grits and a bacon-mustard dressed frisée salad.  The belly was slow cooked and tender and had a fantastic crust seared on it.

I opted for the French dip sandwich.  Excellent thinly shaved rare beef served on a brioche bun with gruyere cheese and the standard Au jus.  This was an excellent version of a popular sandwich full of flavor that was topped off with a side of duck fat fries that were so good that no ketchup or sauce was needed.

The ambiance was fantastic.  Just the right amount of light and very nice modern feel.  You can tell a lot of effort was put into the design of this place.

We will be going back sometime for sure, it sounds like they have a new fantastic brunch buffet as well!"}
{"text":"Really yummy food, but like the name a bit salty. I had the bacon and eggs: creamy grits with pork belly and an egg. Really good, but it was salty. And I like salt, a lot of salt. But the salt was coming from the grits, not the pork belly. 

Wine was good, Brussels sprouts were good, dessert was great. Service was also great: Nate was super attentive. 

I'll go back, I'll just get something different. My hubs meal of the fried chicken thighs way also tasty."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to go here at the last minute on a Friday evening when I didn't feel like cooking.  We made a reservation about an hour in advance and were seated immediately.  The decor is nice - I liked the colors, the textures, and the distressed brick.  It has an upscale gastropub feel.  There are long high top tables in the middle of the restaurant that looked like they held multiple parties of people, but we were seated in a booth.  The booths were very private, which we really liked.

We got there at the tail end of happy hour, so we ordered our drinks and appetizers immediately.  We had the pork belly taco and the duck fat fries.  Both were excellent, and honestly if I had just ordered two tacos and the fries to myself it would have been the perfect meal.  I'll definitely return for the taco.

For dinner my husband had slow-cooked beef shoulder and I had the bacon-wrapped pork filet mignon.  My husband's meal was better.  Mine was fine, but the whole dish was just a little too sweet for my liking.  After the smoky, meaty pork belly taco, I was wanting something similar in taste.  I would get something different next time.  We also had the bananas foster beignets for dessert.  They were soooo good!  

All in all, I will definitely return to the Salty Sow.  It wasn't the best meal I've ever had in Phoenix, but it was still excellent - from ambiance, to service, to food - and I can't wait to come back and sample some more of the menu."}
{"text":"Been a few times for the Sunday brunch buffet which is not a typical buffet. The variety of food choices, I would consider to be elevated ingredients and moreso gourmet...DELICIOUS! The atmosphere, decor and service is always lovely. Our server was Zack, very hospitable and nice.

I would recommend and will be returning!"}
{"text":"Great local bar and restaurant in the PV area.  Service attentive starting with Glen the bartender.   Great specialty drinks and local beers on draft.   Happy hour food not only good but filling saw many people eating at the bar.  Everyone at the bars seems to know each other very cool.  Had a bite of my friends giant prime rib.  One word yummy."}
{"text":"If I could give less than one star I would.  We arrived on a Wednesday evening around 745 and it appeared like a very nice place to eat. Great Decour people at the bar and had a great vibe there must've been a slight problem at the front desk said wait to be seated but nobody arrived for around 3 to 7 minutes more around the seven minute. We were seated in a section with just several tables so I was expecting very good service. After 8 to 10 minutes a pleasant young lady sorry that we ordered glasses of wine which appeared and with a smile she said I will be back. Unfortunately she was never to return at least to our table walk by several times as we almost yelled offending other customers to get her attention but to no avail. We finally got up and left I explained to the front desk person that she should explain to her manager what happened and she laughed it off saying she would let the waitress know that she lost another customer.     By the way there was no apparent supervision of the employees which would've solve our problem right away perhaps better management is in order"}
{"text":"Went to lunch at Salty Sow with a friend.  Sorry to say my friend doesn't have an adventurous palate however I really liked the place.  It was clean and the service by Holly was excellent.

I had the catfish with slay and duck fat fries.  Yummy.  The fish was not greasy and the fries were very good.  The slaw was excellent and the dipping sauce for the fish was tasty.

I will go back but with someone with a more adventurous palate.  Not that Salty Sow food is way out its' just that my friend didn't know what catfish or duck fate was.  Oh well."}
{"text":"My daughter told us that they have prime rib dinners 50% off on Sunday, so we ventured there.
The four of us ordered the 12 oz Prime Rib dinner, $15, and it came with a small green salad which was lightly dressed, but it came out after we received our entrees.
We ordered the Chorizo stuffed mushrooms which was delicious and had a kick to it. But, the mushrooms were teeny tiny with a thumbs full of chorizo. It was happy hour so it was $7. For that, I would try something different.
The prime rib was cooked to perfection. Still juicy and flavorful. It came with mashed potatoes which was maybe serveral spoonfuls and horseradish.
We ended our meals with a brownie with ice cream dessert."}
{"text":"Beef shoulder. Beef shoulder. Beef shoulder.
Guess what I ordered?

Drinks are great as well. Will definitely be back. Good place to watch the game at the bar. Live music several days on the patio."}
{"text":"An excellent experience had by both my wife and I, who went there for happy hour after we received sub-par service at another bar-restaurant in the area. We enjoyed fantastic service by the entire staff and munched on Chorizo Mushrooms and Eggplant Frites with marinara sauce; both outstanding starter choices and well priced. (Bill for both and a beer and diet Coke was $20) The Salty Sow is simply the finest choice in or around PV Mall!"}
{"text":"Very happening Scottsdale spot -- expect a lot of women in heels!

Pros:
-Good, fresh food
-Kind  and friendly service

What We Ordered:
-Eggplant frites -- ABSOLUTE MUST! They came piping hot and melted in your mouth!
-Crispy brussel sprout leaves - also fantastic IF you like brussels :)
-Ahi tuna with avocado -- expensive but fresh and divine with a refreshing lime marinade!
-Cauliflower wild rice side dish - kind of bland, sitting in cream and butter and cheese. Wouldn't order again.

Overall: Great & expensive!"}
{"text":"We came here for happy hour, right when they opened one weekday. My husband had been there before on the patio and could only talk about the duck fat fries with the egg on top and the chill atmosphere. I wanted sushi, but because I love him ever so much, I gave in.

So we sat at the bar and were greeted with a friendly duo of bartenders, who took care of our every query. I had a delicious Copper State mule that melted away my workday, as well as any thought of the sushi. Of course, we ordered their duck fat fries, which did not disappoint. Next came the honey rosemary fried chicken. SO delicious. I tend to forget how much I love fried chicken. Crispy and sweet with honey, plus that hint of rosemary.... it was amazing. The brussels sprouts were pretty good. Crispy, but I found myself picking around the raisins (we had leftovers of the brussels, which I ended up tossing into my scrambled eggs with havarti the next morning. SUPERB). With my love of eggs, it was necessary to have the truffled deviled eggs. This was the only downfall of the evening. Lots of truffle oil, the bits of bacon were soggy, and it tasted like there was no egg yolk at all in the deviled egg filling. It was missing the color and flavor that we were hoping for. Husband pretty much hated it, so we opted for another order of the fries, since he was feeling nervous about ordering the mousse appetizer (but that's the first thing I'm ordering the next time I'm in!). 

I noticed most, if not all, the tables were high tops. And they have some long tables that would be great for large parties. I like being able to see into the kitchen while they make everyone's food and I think it's interesting how all the servers are kind of dressed like they're all wearing a chef's jacket. Is that just me? I kept thinking the  chef was personally checking on a couple tables before I caught on. 

One of our amazing bartenders told us about the porchetta that is made every Sunday and it sounded like perfection with a side of fingerling potatoes. So we'll be back soon to chill on their lovely patio with another mule and to eat too much amazing food. Very very soon."}
{"text":"The food here is wonderfully delicious. My mom took me here recently and I loved it. A little on the pricey side but definitely worth it. Only four stars, however, because of the noise level. Couldn't really talk to my mom or hear myself think."}
{"text":"I'd say my wife and I have visited the Salty Sow maybe 5-6 times now.  Each and every time we had a great experience.

We've worked our way around them menu now, trying almost everything they offer.  We have yet to be let down on the food.

BUT!  Let's talk about Mr. Shaw.  You come up with this great drink.  You get me hooked on the damn things.  Then you lose your supplier for one of the ingredients.  :(

Please please please find a new one...  it would make my 2017 year!!

We will keep coming back!!"}
{"text":"It's ok. Menu maybe a little too southern authentic for me.  Steak sandwich nothing to write yelp about :  )."}
{"text":"We finally made it to Salty Sow and will  definitely be back. We started with drinks at their great open air bar . When we decided to eat , we were lucky enough to get Kayla as a server. We started with the duck fries and truffled eggs, both were delicious.For dinner, we had the crispy chicken thighs which we're amazing and the shredded pork as well. Food  was delicious and the restaurant has a great feel. Kayla took great care of us and was very informative. Unfortunately we were too full and missed out on dessert. What a great addition to the PV area."}
{"text":"I read a lot of great reviews for this place especially about the food. The atmosphere was very nice and the decor clean lines and trendy. The food wasn't what I expected I know this sounds silly but it was truly salty I couldn't drink enough water that evening to satisfy my thirst. I did love the guacamole and chips best I ever had. I had the slow roasted pork as the main and it was a little on the cool side. Tender but overly salty. It was a challenge choosing something on the menu. I will go back for cocktails and the entertainment was great. But overall not my place for food. But do try for yourself."}
{"text":"I didn't expect a riveting experience at a restaurant positioned in front of a Wal-Mart.  But Salty Sow was good, really good.
I've only been here once, for lunch on a weekend.  The dinner menu looks a bit heavy in my opinion, so don't bring your Veg friends.
However, lunch fare is a bit lighter and was awesome.  I had the special du jour, a truffle-laced turkey salad sandwich, piled high on thick toasted sourdough bread, with arugula, tomato and avocado.  It came with a side of deeply golden, salty fries that were wonderful.  For $10!  Good stuff.  I also had a blood orange margarita (or three).  Tequila love.
One dining pal had a lamb burger ($15ish) that he insisted was tremendous, and based on the fact that it was devoured in under 4 minutes I'll take his word for it.  The other guest had the pork belly over collared greens, and though I didn't try it, it too received very good reviews and the portion was aptly ample.
Our waitress was lovely, management (or was it ownership?) graciously swooped by every table to check in, and I dug the modern but casual décor."}
{"text":"7/9/14

Came here to celebrate my birthday, albeit a day later.  Mom and aunt had never visited SS before, but cousin joined me for happy hour a few months ago.  While all enjoyed the atmosphere, we found the alcoholic beverages and food, for the most part, underwhelming.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/salty-sow-phoenix?select=JH4WTi8bA2kMyK7rj5Fw_Q#JH4WTi8bA2kMyK7rj5Fw_Q  
Cousin talked up the Banana beignets and ice cream, as we shared one during hh months ago, and all but aunt, who didn't sample, liked it. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/salty-sow-phoenix?select=AoUOns5QomxCLGgHKjNqDg#AoUOns5QomxCLGgHKjNqDg  The ONE thing I COMPLETELY enjoyed was the (complimentary) birthday dessert, the dessert special of the day of Lemon Bar, tart, rich cream, and not very sweet lemon cheesecake on a crust that I didn't sample, adorned with homemade whip cream, fresh blueberries, and two mint leaves.  The homemade vanilla bean ice cream, though not needed as the cheesecake was sumptuous by itself, was a nice touch.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/salty-sow-phoenix?select=rqWfmUCntSw0rLrWMY6Gxw#rqWfmUCntSw0rLrWMY6Gxw    Mom, who didn't find the beignets and ice cream dish anything to write home about, found the lemon bar quite tasty.  :)  

Crispy Brussels sprouts- I didn't enjoy this one as much as I did in the past.  Bland, not crispy, and the pecorino didn't add the punch I remembered.

Beef shoulder and Spit-roasted pork tacos- cousin ate these and enjoyed them, but wouldn't order them again. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/salty-sow-phoenix?select=9jh3odIqg17KC5SAEbd5sQ#9jh3odIqg17KC5SAEbd5sQ

Fried chicken and sweet potato biscuit- The chicken was only partially-cooked-- dark pink center, and I couldn't chew through the meat completely.  My cousin agreed, and the server took it away and had another one fired up.  However, the second piece was also undercooked!  The manager came out and spoke to us, assuring me that the kitchen uses a thermometer to discern when the food is ready to be served, so the chicken should be perfectly-done.  The sweet potato biscuit was fine.  I was still disappointed in the quality of the chicken, and the item was removed from the bill.  Thank you, Salty Sow!  :)

Duck-fat fries- We didn't find it anything special, and I did not like the egg on top. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/salty-sow-phoenix?select=0IZ2t2ayK9VRa1RhIwh__w#0IZ2t2ayK9VRa1RhIwh__w  I've had poutine fries at Nook and loved those, so it must be the duck fat used to cook the fries in that we all were not impressed with.  

As far as the happy hour beverages we ordered ($2 off specialty cocktails)... My aunt enjoyed her Rosemary's Piglet, a pretty concoction of pomegranate juice, bubbly, and rosemary syrup; the ice cube had a rosemary sprig trapped inside it (this reminded me of the Rosemary margarita I had at the now-closed Renegade by MOD- check out the photos I included in that review*- very pretty!).  Cousin had the Salty Sow Sparkling Sangria (elderflower liqueur, bubbly, orange and lemon juices, one grape, opal basil), which she's ordered before and liked, and I tried the Miss Piggy (X-rated Fusion, bubbly, grapefruit sugar rim; I don't recommend it).

{"text":"First time to this restaurant I went as someone had recommended it. The service was terrible. After 10 minutes waiting for a server I went and talked with the hostess. We finally had a server come over who then got the order wrong and had to wait another 15 mins for the correct food to come out. The manager apologized but that was it. A very bad first impression and I will not be returning as the food was mediocre."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place because the menu looks amazing and I'm a huge foodie.    We got there at 7:30 on a Sunday evening and the porchetta and roasted pork were both sold out.   Disappointing considering they only opened at 4pm.  

We tried:
Duck fries: it was okay,  nothing special.   The best part was the sauce.   The eggs over the fries seemed a bit overcooked.  It didn't run at all. 

Bone marrow: again,  it tasted good,  but wasn't phenomenal at all.

Brussel sprouts caesar salad: this was actually the winner of the meal.   The nutty taste from the roasted brussel sprouts really paired well with the craisins and light caesar dressing.  I would totally get this again. 

Pork belly: I am usually a huge fan of pork belly,  but this was disappointing.   It was just an oily slab of fat that left a slick layer of grease on my plate.  When it's done right,  it's tender and the meat and fat melts in your mouth.   This just didn't do that.   The salad that accompanied it was actually nice,  but the pork bits are REALLY salty and you'd probably do better with just half of a piece per bite. 

I wanted to love this place, but sadly I didn't."}
{"text":"Oh where to begin the goodness!

The spot: the building is very eye catching right off the bat. Walking in it gorgeous!! stunning suedeish white seat that were super comfy. I love the open kitchen and the awesome draft beer pipe haning from the ceiling was rad.

Grubs: We had a huge meal starting with the meat and cheese plate that was amazing . I had read the menu on line about the deviled eggs and I was so excited about, and they came through, I could have ordered four orders as my meal
:)), then we had the brussels ceaser and also a beet and goat cheese salad(.i have actually gone back again for that salad) followed by a fall apart(in a good way) milk braised pork shoulder and the pork belly . The sauce from the pork belly was sent straight from heaven. finally some pudding and the bananas foster  , which is anything but standard, lil bananas hot stuffed donut things.. noms noms!

Cocktails were spot on , lots of options that include sparkling wine, which I love in my cocktails!

I have already gone back and look forward to checking out the happy hour next.

Killer food , drinks and service!

Oh yeah get a spot outside on the patio its beautiful!"}
{"text":"I only had one appetiser but love the place! Contemporary meets southwest style restaurant is so trendy. I'll post a review when I get a chance to try an entree :-)"}
{"text":"The food was amazing and unexpected! The service was top notch! The place was slammed and everything came out on time. Our server Jackie was great!!!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place after receiving a gift card for Christmas. We started with the fried chicken and biscuit. The oil seemed old but the chicken was juicy. I liked the gravy and the biscuit was tasty. We also tried the truffle deviled eggs which were my favorite things we had all night. For our entrees I ordered the pork shoulder rack plate, the pork was very good but the rest of the sides were just okay. My fiancé got a double cheeseburger with pork belly. It was sloppy but otherwise pretty good. The duck fat fries reminded me of in and out but crispier, no sense of duck fat though. Cocktails were pretty good and our server was fast and knowledgeable. Based on this experience alone I don't think that I would make the drive and spend the money to go back. Just nothing spectacular"}
{"text":"This has been our local \" go to\" for many years but , it has taken a turn for the worse.... it began with changes in staff , menu and entertainment. The beer dinners were cancelled , the live entertainment and now the daily specials . It's sad to see such a great restaurant go downhill , on the positive side , the food is still delicious, service courteous & prompt & it's a great spot for Happy Hour !"}
{"text":"Overpriced and slack service. Happy hour is a fair deal but service during that time is super slow. Went in for dinner late night once and was sat with back to host stand and could hear all the drama and bitching going on between them. The food was in fact tasty but not worth the $127 bill for the two of us. I would go in again for happy hour on a random week day but I don't think I would be back for an actual meal. I would also suggest they fix that table behind the host and put a better barrier up or get rid of the table all together. It's just unprofessional for the teenage hosts to be gossiping the entire shift while ears are close by listening."}
{"text":"I love this place it has a great happy hour and I love their fried chicken. Really really a tasty spot to go grab happy hour and on Wednesdays they have all day happy hour so you really can't be that salty sow is one of my neighborhood spots."}
{"text":"Love this place. Can be loud when it's busy but lots of cool decor to look at and usually great music. They sometimes have live music on the patio, and a separate  happy hour menu which makes this a great spot to meet friends. Never had anything that I didn't like but some favs are the happy hour fried chicken, roast beef sandwich, and the green chili appetizer with fresh tortillas. Michael is the best server always remembers us and always great service."}
{"text":"Let me first say that I have eaten here more than 10 times and usually it is always a 5 star experience.

That being said on this night they were out of 3 main dishes due to them not getting their \"meat delivery\".

This was not brought up when we made our reservation nor when we were seated. Only after our drink order and being seated for 20 minutes did we find out they were out of 3 main dishes. One of which is the extremely popular French dip sandwhich. 

They could have saved me time and themselves a terrible review by being upfront with the delivery issue.

Unacceptable"}
{"text":"Awesome! I highly recommend the Blanche to start. Chorizo stuffed mushrooms are SO good (not sure if I liked the chorizo, mushrooms, or dipping the bread in the butter best)! Beef shoulder is great comfort food. Casual, comfortable atmosphere. Nice people; kudos to Jenna for being so pleasant."}
{"text":"One of the best happy hours I've been to in Arizona.

We pretty much ordered the entire HH menu:
1) Truffled delived eggs
2) Duck fat fries
3) Brussels sprout leaves
4) Spit-roasted pork taco
5) Pork belly taco
6) Beef shoulder taco
- The fries and the pork tacos were the best.

The food came out quickly and our server was on top of everything despite it being really busy."}
{"text":"Enjoyed some tasty apps...Chicken Liver Mousse was the tastiest of the three, but they were all good ( Brussel sprouts leaves & Duck fat fries eaten also).
Had both the spit roasted  and pork belly tacos. Both were very good , but go for the pork belly.  Had the beet salad also. Delicious!

Our service was awesome ( party of eight) and really enjoyed the atmosphere.  Wish we could have tried the patio..

FYI...Happy hour all night on Monday & Tuesday."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! We came here for happy hour and our server was very nice, he explained everything and their special of the day. The ambiance was nice too! Our drinks came, one of my favorite was the rosemary's piglet. What a unique drink, they made the ice cube with rosemary leaves infused into it, when melted, you can taste it with your drink. I usually don't drink but when I do, I like it when I can't taste the alcohol. For the food, everything tasted good! I ordered the pork belly taco and the crispy brussels sprout to share, and I have a lil bite of the beef shoulder taco and everything else.The tacos has fried eggs on top, which was really good & also the beef shoulder taco, the crispy brussels were tasty. All of them were good! I will definitely come back and make a reservation for another happy hour!"}
{"text":"We loved the Salty Sow!  Great food, service, cocktails & atmosphere!  This was our first time & we will definitely be back.  The deviled eggs were delicious.  We tried the tuna & pork prime rib.  Both were fantastic.  My favorite new cocktail is the salty sow'r - bourbon / lime juice - incredible!  We loved the side dishes too.  Great spot to meet friends too!"}
{"text":"Brunch buffet! Put some salt on that sow, place it on a buffet table and chow down! We came here for their all you can eat Sunday buffet. It was a spectacular array of food, a mix of southwestern and southern comfort dishes. Some items at the buffet included carved rotisserie turkey, pork loin, green chile pork, fried green tomatoes, roasted beets, green bean casserole, scrambled eggs, smoked salmon and pork belly hash. There was also a wide selection of pastries and cookies for dessert.

My favorite dishes from the buffet were the green chile pork and the smoked salmon. The pork was very tender and the flavors were bold and spicy. The flour tortillas they were paired with were warm and very fresh. The salmon was very moist and soft with just the right amount of smoke flavor.

The price for the buffet was $18.95, not bad at all for the amount of food we had to choose from! We came here around 11 and it wasn't too busy either.

If I'm in a gluttonous mood I'll definitely be coming back to this buffet!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I just discovered this place! I got the pork shoulder and it was absolutely delicious. I only wish the portions were a little bit bigger. But they make up for the quantity with quality. Also a good selection of drinks on the menu. I can't wait to come back and try some more."}
{"text":"I went hog wild over this place. 

I adored the decorations and found they did not overdo the pig theme. It was actually really classy. But as a warning, the door is very heavy so be prepared to use your strength so you don't look like me struggling. 

We ordered several different items and really pigged out, so I was able to try almost everything in the menu. Wednesday's is prime rib day, and they do not disappoint. Large slabs of meat, cooked beautifully red throughout....delicious. I ordered the chicken (yes, I know. Chicken at a pig place...) but it was amazing. The skin was crispy while the inside was juicy. There was not a single complaint of the food items ordered. 

Our waiter was extremely patient with our group of ~20 and our food was delivered with no errors and very timely. 

Overall, delicious food, and definitely a meat lovers paradise."}
{"text":"We stopped in for happy hour/early dinner and had a wonderful experience!  We were sat right away and our server could not have been more genuinely sweet.  The four of us shared the Brussels sprouts and nachos to start and both dishes were delicious.  We all loved the addition of golden raisins to the Brussels and I know nachos seem like a simple dish, but they way they layered the cheese sauce meant every chip had the perfect amount.  I declared them the beset nachos I'd ever eaten!

For dinner, we ordered two courses split and they were nice enough to plate them separately, without us asking.  I love that!  Even split, we all had such generous portions.  I don't know that I LOVED the fish and chips but I did like it a lot.  This was a restaurant win!"}
{"text":"One of our new favorite places in PHX. We were looking for something a little bit different with great food that didn't have a terribly pretentious feel like so many other \"foodie spots\" The Salty Sow is just that! 

I did a burger and my wife did the ribeye tacos, both of which were amazing. We sat outside and the atmosphere was great. Service was attentive without being overbearing and the food came out promptly and perfectly cooked. 

I would definitely recommend this as a spot to anyone looking for something a bit different whose been to all of the usual spots in PHX."}
{"text":"Well the bartender can make good drinks.
We were there during happy hour. Ordered or happy hour tacos and it said for sharing on the menu. It came to the table the appetizer which said for sharing on their menu and it was only one taco. Maybe if the waitress would've said G you told me one talk or we would've ordered two but it said it was for sharing."}
{"text":"Just got back from Salty Sow and it was fantastic! Good waitress, good food and good looking inside. I loved the decor.  Wood work was clean. Lighting was just right. We all 3 really enjoyed our dinner here tonight. Only complaint was it's a little pricey. I'm not taking any stars off for that. You get what you pay for, and we got a real nice experience tonight."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar Saturday night. Bar tender was great and we had the lamb burger and the fries. All pretty awesome. The burger was soooo fresh"}
{"text":"Dog friendly patio and staff was awesome. They offered stellar service from the go, and have delivered every time we go back"}
{"text":"Just had dinner with appetizers outstanding. Deviled Eggs, Bone Morrow, Chicken n Biscuits, Lamb Burger, Chesse burger, Cream Burla.  Nice job Brady and crew."}
{"text":"Deliciousness - 4/5
Happiness - 3.5/5

A true gastropub in that you can find food and drinks here that you can't find anywhere else. It's a very intimate setting that prizes open air access. Unfortunately, it's located right off Cactus, so your view is simply of a ton of cars. A bit more pricey than I'd prefer, but you can't say you don't get the bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Brandon, our server was wonderful and made our brunch so fun. I used to come in at least once a week until I could no longer stand the subpar service, today has renewed my faith in Salty. The food as always was delicious!"}
{"text":"Really cool atmosphere with amazing sinful food! Triple fried duck fat fries!!!!(there is soooooo much more)  It's everything you want and more! Very reasonable pricing, until you lose control and decide to try everything!!! Service has been great everytime! Defently worth trying!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner, first experience here.  

Busy night but we were seated fairly soon at high-top table with a footrest bar, interesting but a little hard to keep my sandals on as my feet dangled or slipped on the bar!  Trendy décor, rather noisy, conversation was difficult, also the light over our table was out so it was quite dark, not so good to read the small printed menu.  A nice outdoor patio where a musician was playing, music piped inside too but sound system made a regular and rather annoying cracking noise.  They also have a number of very long high top tables that could accommodate a large group intimately or several groups of guests for community dining.    

As for the food - we tried crispy chicken thighs and asigo-crusted halibut.  Both entrees were very flavorful with a pretty presentation.  3 pieces of chicken, each served on a smashed potato, some kind of sauce all around.  Yummy with leftovers to go home.  The halibut was seriously overcooked, not flaky but mushy.  I debated about sending it back but I was hungry and it tasted great so I didn't mention to our server.  If it had been properly (or even semi-properly) cooked, this entrée would have been outstanding.  The flavor was delicious in spite of the overcooked state of the fish.  Served w/ broccolini.  

Service was adequate but not inspiring.   

I noted Happy Hour specials and some other interesting items on the menu.  I plan to go back and try the patio next time."}
{"text":"Jess bartender is mediocre. Not friendly. Doesn't really know the menu (said she hasn't tried food since opening so doesn't know a lot of the menu). 

Empty on Sat night in restaurant, bar, and patio. 

These guys need to do something different (service, TVs, etc) or will be out of business soon.

Booths (whole line of them on the right side of the restaurant) are super low-backed making head-knocking your neighbor to your rear likely. 

Small beer glasses

Reverse HH (9pm-close daily) are cheaper but FAR SMALLER PORTIONS and not really a value. $5 fries have one egg."}
{"text":"Not great thus no reason to go back. Hubby and I both had the fish and duck fat fries. The fish breading came out rather dark and very greasy which is a sign that the grease needed changing. Also, the fish was not real firm (go to Oscar's Pier 83 for great fried fish) although it tasted fine. The fries tasted really good (duck fat does that for fries) but the longest fry on our plates was about 2 inches long with many of the other fries 1 inch or so (we label that as \"scrap inclusion\"). Disappointed."}
{"text":"In town for vacation and tried this restaurant based on Yelp reviews.  It did not disappoint. We started with the fried green tomatoes, which were awesome. We also enjoyed our entrees.  Great dining experience."}
{"text":"My wife (finance at the time) and I went to the Sow when they opened and fell in love with it.  We live in East Mesa so traveling to a destination restaurant and falling in love with it is a great experience and makes the \"travel\" worth it all.  Unfortunately, we returned with a group of 6 for a birthday as we recommended the Sow for the great food and atmosphere.  The atmosphere, service and friendliness of staff was GREAT!!!  Unfortunately, the food on this visit was sub-par.  It was quite disappointing as we took a large group this time and only two people out of the six really enjoyed the food.  The Halibut and the Prime Rib were very good - probably a 3.5/4 out of 5.  However, the flank steak and the pork belly that everyone else got was not very good.  Pork belly was VERY tough, grey and overcooked.  Side (especially the grits) were terrible - they all seemed old and re-heated.  It was an unfortunate visit to a great restaurant.  We have always been a fan of the Roaring Fork as well but with so many restaurants in the area the food needs to come back to the standard of our first visit to really impress and keep a regular customer base."}
{"text":"Wanted to go to a gastropub, and ended up here.

This is a really nice place inside.  Comfortable seating of all types.  A big bar.  The kitchen is wide open for all to see.  The restrooms are clean and nice, too.

We ordered;  triple fried duck fries (excellent fries), chicken liver mousse (this was absolutely excellent - could not stop eating), bone marrow (very good flavor),  candied pork belly (quite good).

Thoruoughly enjoyed my experience here.  The service was excellent.

Also tried 3 of their tasy signature drinks; maple glazed old fashioned, frozen 'rita, and another.

A great place to dine!"}
{"text":"The food is 4 stars, the customer service was 2 stars. We sat on the bar for dinner. Not sure if it was my accent or his lack of dopamine/serotonin flow, but we had a mean unwelcoming service. I still left him a 20% tip...Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"I had been here once before for a large event, and got to try a bunch of their dishes and remember thinking that all of them were so good! My husband, toddler and I came here for HH tonight and again, I was impressed! I ordered the sunset sangria which was awesome. Not too sweet like most sangrias, definitely more of a cocktail. We split the truffle deviled eggs, honey crispy chicken, and Louisiana bousin fritters. The fritters weren't my favorite, oh well, my husband had no problem eating them. The chicken was delicious, I especially loved the gravy and biscuit. The eggs were very tasty. The quality of food is very high and the chef truly is an artist."}
{"text":"I only have good things to say about the Salty Sow. They have a great menu overall, with a pretty extensive HH menu too. The cocktails are extremely high quality, service has always been great, and they offer a ton of unique food options. The brussel sprouts + pecorino + golden raisins is to die for...I have to admit I've started making this creative dish myself, thanks to the Salty Sow! I return here as often as possible!"}
{"text":"Not sure if I should start with the service or the food, both were AMAZING. Sam took very good care of us the sous chef came over and explained how everything was prepped and cooked for us. I'm not sure how I've never heard of this place before I know I'll be talking about Salty Sow for the next few weeks. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"What's not to love?? 

The beautiful and trendy indoor/outdoor atmosphere with excellent/mild (guitar) live music was exactly what my DH and I were looking for this evening (Sat, early, around 6:30-7:30-ish). 

We planned on splitting the French Dip w/duck fat fries and the ABLT Salad. Though, once I tasted the salad, I did NOT want to share!! :) AND - I'm not typically a 'salad person' DELISH!! My only complaint would be that it was served on a very long/narrow plate. I can totally see using a cute/contemporary plate like that for apps.  It just made my fab salad a bit difficult to eat (especially w/the butter knife I was given) :(  

The dip was rarer than rare, a deal-breaker for me but DH enjoyed it. The 'duck fat' fries were great! However, I honestly couldn't tell the diff from other great fries cooked in reg oil. ;)

The place was a lot larger and nicer (and busier) than I expected. Service was good. We only stopped by for an hour or so tonight before an event. I'm happy to have found a new date night spot for DH and I!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, cozy and upscale. We order the Crispy Chicken Thighs and the PV Salad and both were delicious. The chicken was crispy as promised and very moist and tender. It came with smashed potatoes which were also crispy on the outside and creamy inside. The chicken includes two generous thighs so we were slightly disappointed that only  the few potatoes accompanied the entree. 

The PV salad was entree sized and included a generous amount chicken breast. I enjoyed all the goodies in the salad, especially the fresh avocado and dates. 

Our server was friendly and attentive, no issues at all with the service. 

Look forward to a return visit."}
{"text":"Knew I was going to like this place the first time I came. It's the only restaurant I've been to where I'm depressed when I order... Knowing that I am missing out on everything else on the menu. Do not be afraid to take a doggie box home. The food is just as good the next day. Try the Duck Confit Fettuccine. About a dozen flavors hit your pallet in a swirl of ecstasy. The Truffled Deviled Eggs are amazing."}
{"text":"Dessert and beers were second to none. Appetizers and main course were subpar. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"I consider myself a porketarian. We live in Tucson and I have wanted to experience the Salty Sow for over a year. Finally, the timing worked out for us this last Friday night. 

The ambiance was trendy and busy and a bit loud (quite expected on a Friday night).

Our appetizer was the green chile pork stew and it was the best version I had ever eaten. My main course was the pork belly (my favorite cut of pork) and it was \"rolling your eyes, melt in your mouth excellent\". Definitely my favorite pork belly I have eaten in the USA. Our dessert was creme brulee which was very good.

We are primarily beer drinkers and we have experienced the \"Wet snout milk stout\" only in bottles or cans in Tucson. This was the first time we had this beer on draft and it was also a superb choice for pairing with our meal.

The Salty Sow was a terrific experience from start to finish and we will return!"}
{"text":"Shared Valentine's Day with my wife here.  The prime rib was superb. Our waitress was perfect and took great care of us."}
{"text":"Prime Rib was delicious!  Deviled eggs were tasty and the sangria  it was fabulous!  The service was not good at all. Our waiter let my drink run dry twice and was very scarce throughout our meal."}
{"text":"BEST HAPPY HOUR EVER. Every day from 4-630 pm, $5-7 small plates, $2 off all cocktails, wine and beer!

Normally I feel there's only a couple good items on HH menus and we also have to order from the regular menu, but there were so many yummy looking items on the HH menu here that we wanted everything on it!! 

Truffled Deviled Eggs- generous portion with four halves, yumm
Chicken Liver Mousse- wonderfully creamy, comes with toasted bread
Crispy Brussel Sprout Leaves - sooo good, light and crispy 
Honey Rosemary Dipped Fried Chicken - I personally didn't like the sweetness of it, but the fiancee loved it. chicken was perfectly crispy and cooked. 
Catfish Taco - really well flavored, one of the best fish tacos I've had
Fried Green Tomatos- fiancee was very happy since he's southern.. comes atop a great guac

Wonderful service, great ambience with a nice dog-friendly outdoor patio. Trendy vibe with a good crowd without being too loud"}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Great drinks, great food, great service! Lucky to have it in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed sitting on the patio with all the heaters. Happy hour is served anywhere in the restaurant. Food and service were excellent. Will be dining here again soon."}
{"text":"We came to the Salty Sow Sunday night (November 4th) - my wife and our 2 daughters.  I've been intending to try it although I did think this was more of a barbecue restaurant.  Turns out it is a gastropub.  We still enjoyed it.  My family wanted the deviled egg appetizer and the fried green tomatoes.  I had the green chili pork stew with tortillas. The tortillas were hot and the stew was really tasty.  It was just a little spicy.  My young daughter ate some of it too so you know it can't be that spicy.  The girls thought the deviled eggs were too salty.  I had one and liked it.  The bacon pieces were a nice touch but I think they should use more. 

The chicken sandwich I had was really good.  It was breaded and had crispy kale and some Cole slaw on it and I loved it!   My daughters had burgers and they enjoyed them."}
{"text":"Having eaten here one year before, we knew what we were getting into:  Great food options, solid prices, friendly service, and ambiance.  First, it was a couple of cold drafts of AZ brews, both very refreshing after an 80 degree day in early February.  Then, we had the truffled deviled eggs, which are darn good!  For the meal, I had the pork chops, which came stacked 3 high, meat only (no bone), on top of smashed sweet potatoes and also came with green beans.  My wife had pork belly, which was delicious and came with grits and arugula salad.  All flavors complemented each other.  Great atmosphere added to this experience.  It is on our list when we next return to the Valley of the Sun."}
{"text":"Came for happy hour and finger foods, it was awesome. Good was great, environment was awesome and our server was great. Yeah prices were kinda high but the food didn't disappoint so it was a win."}
{"text":"Great food, new expanded menu. The Nachos are amazing. Friendly staff the cheers of the neighborhood. The to go orders are always right!  They have it dialed in!"}
{"text":"Don't know why I waited so long to try the Salty Sow.  Maybe I assumed that because every other restaurant by PV Mall has been sub-par, Salty Sow must be, too.  Really sorry to prejudge you like that, Salty Sow.

On a busy Friday night, they took my online reservation and even though the place was packed we only had to wait a couple of minutes for our table.

The server was as professional as any we've had in the Valley, which is saying a lot.

Sorry to tell you that I'm not much of a beer drinker, but the beer list looked good.  The wine list was very good and had wines by the glass for every budget and palate.  Drinks did take longer than I wanted.  I should have been more sympathetic that the bar was jammed for Friday Happy Hour, but it was a family gathering and, well, you know...I just needed that glass of wine now.

The menu is diverse with offerings from entree salads (really inventive ones, not the typical chicken ceasar) to burgers to chile verde to slow roasted meats and grilled meat/fish.  Everyone at the table loved everything they got.  The food was very well executed, was delivered in a reasonable time and our waiter and one other staff person checked in frequently to make sure all was well.

For the excellent food, drinks and service, the bill was roughly 20% less than an equivalent restaurant would charge.  Shame on me for taking so long to eat here.

One should be aware that the Salty Sow is very noisy, which didn't bother us at all, but really it is probably the noisiest restaurant around.  Not the place for a quiet meal, but it is perfect if you want lively atmosphere.

We all agreed we love the Salty Sow and will be back soon!"}
{"text":"An oasis in a desert of chain restaurants.

Good service, fairly priced wines and beers.  Good salads, excellent charcuterie plate, lamb burgers, duck fat fries etc.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Quite honestly one of the best dishes I've ever had. Asiago crusted halibut with broccoli. Absolutely fabulous cook to perfection. I came here specifically for this dish, and let me tell you, it did not disappoint! If you even remotely enjoy a whitefish, this is a must order  entree!"}
{"text":"This was our fourth visit to Salty Sow.  We do not go back to places that aren't at least four or five stars - too many good restaurants to waste your time on mediocre.

Their Halloween, BOBO on main courses is just too good to pass up.  Top it off with Happy Hour drinks and the value is immense.  My wife's fish and chips (with duck fat fries) was really, really good.  My nightly special of chorizo stuffed pork belly was, in a phrase, out of this world.  Sitting there with a good drink and excellent food watching game 6 of the World Series would have been good enough, but top it off with spectacular service, and you have a night to remember.  Our server, Brenna, was simply amazing.  Sadly, she had to put up with a couple seated next to us that were simply rude and abusive.  Brenna handled it beautifully.  She was so personable, understanding, accommodating, and professional - to them and to us.  We could not have asked for a better server in any environment.  Hopefully, management recognizes what a gem they have in Brenna.

Needless to say, we will be back - many times and would consider ourselves most fortunate to be served by Brenna again."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place!!! The Brussels sprouts are TO DIE FOR! You have to come here! Also a good HH until 630 if you make it out for a early dinner"}
{"text":"Have been going to Salty Sow for some time now.
Went tonight without reservations and was told a 2 hour wait. 
We stepped to the side and were discussing where we should go. 
Doug one of the managers said he can seat us at the chefs table?
Yes please. 
We had the best service from Holly and watched chef BJ prepare our food.
Love it here! 
Thank you for always making our dinner top notch!!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere, Service, and Food were awesome!  Decor was super cool, pork was dynamite, salad was amazing, banana foster beignet's were divine!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"The food was ok, but way overpriced for the portions you receive.  Our waitress told us items were on Happy Hour prices, when this was not reflected in our bill, she took it to the manager and he gave us a whole dollar off!!  We will not be back."}
{"text":"Loved the Duck Fat Fries with 110 minute egg! A lot of the menu items I would never think to order but everything my friends and I tried was really good (including the fried green tomatoes & guacamole!) Great that they use a lot of local ingredients and feature local beers. 

Good selection of items on the dinner menu. I was a big fan of the PV Salad - chicken, arugula, kale, spinach, dates, avocado, blue cheese, candied almonds, bacon, and a hard-boiled egg. 

Really nice inviting atmosphere and décor. Looks like they have a good happy hour too. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Fabulous happy hour, super impressive starters and cocktail menu! Great atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"I go to Salty Sow pretty frequently, but I recently had a birthday celebration there, with 16 others and wanted to update my review. Of course, I already knew the food would be great and they didn't disappoint! I love the happy hour rosemary chicken and we asked if we could place an order the day before for 10 of them and they had no problem with it! The service was fantastic, everyone was so helpful and tried to get things to us in a timely manner. I definitely recommend!!! Get the happy hour fried chicken!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very good food.   Duck fat fries are a favorite.  The aus jus sandwich and prime rib are also very good, nice and salty.  Also love the Brussel sprout salad.  Service is good too.  I really like it when they have live music on most nites.  It's not super loud and it's tasteful."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend and we ordered their duck fries as an appetizer, which was amazing! Now for our entrees, I ordered the rare roast beef French dip and my friend ordered their crispy chicken thighs. My rare roast beef was truly amazing and the meat was so juicy, tender and full of flavors! However, the mash potatoes that came as a side dish wasn't anything special. I took a bite from my friend's plate and felt that his dish was way too salty. 

Dessert: We ordered a chocolate mousse with berries and some lemon bar with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I wasn't a big fan of their chocolate mousse dessert because it tasted very thick and rich. On this plate, it had strawberries, blueberries and some berry jelly smear. The jelly smear had a bitter taste to it and didn't go too well with the chocolate mousse. On the other hand, the lemon bar was edible I shall say. It was very tart and went well with the ice cream. The taste was similar to a key lime pie but obviously made with lemons. 

Overall, the food was good and the place is very nice. It was nice listening to the live band playing on their patio. Service was okay just because our waiter seemed impatient and was in a rush. He was very short with his answers when we asked him questions and toward the end of the night, he asked us to hurry up and pay the tab because he was cut. Such a nice way to end a good night, NOT."}
{"text":"Stopped into Salty Sow 6/12/15 before enjoying the Scottsdale nightlife. There was live entertainment and the ambiance was great....

What I Ordered:

**Louisiana Boudin Fritters $$8 (the chipotle Remoulade sauce was absolutely amazing!!)
**Crisp Chicken Thighs $15 (very flavorful a must try)
**My friend ordered the Slow Cooked Beef Shoulder $19 and I regret not ordering it. It was so darn delicious!!! OMG!!!!!"}
{"text":"*** this is for the internal management and owners not for future customers unless you read the entire review to understand the whole picture ***

I have been to this restaurant twenty plus times and normally it is fantastic.  Unfortunately it takes either an amazing experience or horrible one for me to pull out Yelp and write a review.  This was sadly a horrible experience... 

I have now heard from EVERY server that works here that they are scared of the \"chef\" (aka a glorified line cook since he cooks the same fried chicken every day) and we witnessed it first hand tonight.  I ordered the hanger steak which I have had before and normally great by the way, but tonight it was overlooked slightly so I asked the server if I could get it redone Med Rare and she went back to the open kitchen and we watched her get screamed at and berated by the \"chef\" as he threw he adult version of a temper tantrum throwing his hands in disgust that there is no way with his cooking prowess could he ever make a minor mistake.  

I love the front of he house staff here outside of the male manager who decided it was his right to tell me I was wrong in how I ordered my steak.  The music on the weekend is great and normally the food is great so this review is more for the owners and internal staff not the next customer as the food is great, atmosphere is amazing, and service is outstanding.  They just have a ego problem in the kitchen forgetting that he isn't Bobby Flay and should just keep his head down and make good food without ego."}
{"text":"I really hate to leave this review but I took my family here yesterday after raving about how good this place was for brunch and it was a total let down. I think the biggest diference between my first visit and this visit was timing...My first visit we arrived at 10am so everything was fresh. This time we arrived at 11am and everything was dried out and overcooked due to it siting in the pans/dishes being kept warm, the bacon was mostly burned (although a new batch had been placed out by the time we were preparing to leave after noon), the french toast was dried out, the chicken was dry, the biscuits were hard, just a toal embarassment.

The service is always great here and if I could I would add a half star for that but I don't think my family will be taking my recommendations on where to eat any time soon after this disaster."}
{"text":"Not terrible but very expensive and a bit of an odd presentation.

I stopped in for lunch the other day and sat at the bar.  I found the menu a bit confusing but finally settled on the porkbelly with collard greens.  

It arrived quickly.  The plate was a 5 inch square plate with what was perhaps a 3 oz. piece of porkbelly sitting on top of about a cup of collard greens.  For $12.00.  What was odd, was the porkbelly was sitting in a good half inch of the liquid from the greens, but all I was given was a fork to eat it with and there was also no bread.  Did I mention it was $12.00?  At lunch? I asked for some bread and they brought it out quickly.

The pork belly was pretty good although a bit on the dry side.  The collards were just fine but it's hard to mess up collard greens isn't it?

I asked for the menu again and now I noticed that everything is a la carte, even on the lunch menu.  So I guess I was supposed to order a side of potatoes for an additional six bucks.  

As another Yelper has pointed out, this is after all a restaurant sitting in front of the Walmart so this all seems a bit pretentious.  Look, I don't mind paying for good food in the least but I do object to being presented with a tapas sized portion when I order an entree, particularly when it is involving such low food cost items as pork belly and collard greens.  Seriously, come on guys, what is your food cost on this dish?  I'll guarantee you it's under two bucks.  In my book, that's a rip-off.  

Anyway, I'm not really sure Paradise Valley needs such a precious restaurant but I guess time will tell.   I left hungry and $16.00 poorer.

Finally, I don't get this recent bizarre and unwelcome trend I've observed recently of nice (and expensive) restaurants not serving bread .  What's up with that?  If you're going to serve traditional European/American food and charge a lot of money, bring some nice artisan bread to the table."}
{"text":"What a great place. The food is truly amazing. Fantastic happy hour with a great selection of craft beers. Bartender Glenn is always welcoming and friendly (not to mention a master of his craft). The GM Kevin is gracious and in control of this well oiled machine. I definitely recommend trying this place. You will be hooked!!"}
{"text":"I've been a big fan since this place opened. I believe they are associated with the Hopdoddy folks which explains a lot. If you haven't been to Hoppdoddy I suggest you go there too. Salty Sow has nothing but local beer on tap, great cocktails with some local spirits as well. The happy hour has a lot to offer with duck fat fries, tacos with a nice sunny side up egg, a salami-salmon dish. The entrees are great too with responsibly sourced product that favors an American-contemporary style. Everything is tasty, whether you're in the mood for a 3 course dinner or just an after work cocktail."}
{"text":"The Salty Sow is in my neighborhood and I've always seen this place but never really had a desire to visit but for some reason I really wanted to try a something new. So it's was Salty Sow time. 

We walked in and the place is jammed packed and loud. Not music loud but people loud. We got lucky and got one of the last open tables. Woo hoo. 

We were greeted by our server pretty quickly and got our water glasses and our own water bottle for refills. 

I ordered off the daily special menu. Got the Ribeye tacos and a side of Bacon Mac & Cheese. So the ribeye tacos had guacamole, pickled onions, cilantro and huge chunks of ribeye. These where huge tacos. It was pretty spicy for me but really good. Very filling and enjoyed it. Only problem it was dripping with ribeye oil but that's ok. The tacos came with a side of beans with chunks of pork. I'm a big fan of beans and this was good. Those chunks of pork really made it so good. 

I had to get the bacon Mac & Cheese. It was crazy good. Sprinkled with bacon on top. That bacon really made the Mac & cheese. I'll have no problem ordering this again. 

My wife ordered the PV salad. Baby kale, with avocado, candied almonds, chicken breast, dates, blue cheese with a creamy dressing. This was so good and huge. When my wife took a few bites she said I wouldn't mind coming back to this place. She's never said that. She really liked it and I tried it and it was so good. 

The service was really good. Our server was very good. Really informed on the menu. He kept on bringing new bottles of water when the bottles got low. He kept on checking on us. So service was really good. 

Overall, we had a really good meal but I took off one star off cause of the really oily tacos, but all the other food was really good. Great service. Fun and lively atmosphere. Everyone was having a really good time. So it was really good and we will most likely be back."}
{"text":"Great food... Slow service. They need more wait staff especially on a day like mothers day. Waited forever to order... Forever for our food... And then my steak came out medium rare instead of medium. The steak flavor was delicious as we're the mashed potatoes and the beef shoulder. Like I said... Amazing food, mediocre service due to understaffed restaurant. I'd still come back though."}
{"text":"We stopped by for a nice dinner with some friends after looking at the reviews. The atmosphere was cool, the staff was super helpful (although they seemed very busy), and the food was great! We started off with the? duck fat fries and the nachos which may have been the best part of the meal. For my entree, ?I had a steak salad which was really tasty but a bit too rare for my liking. The server was great and had it cooked a bit more for me. My hubby said his burger was fantastic. The wine was ok- we were expecting something better for the price. Everything was a bit on the expensive side for what it was worth which is why I am only giving 4 stars. We will definitely? be back soon."}
{"text":"First time last night we sat outside on the patio next to the fireplace. The patio was nicely lit up. Our server was nice. Drinks were exceptional. Their grapefruit vodka cocktail is delicious. For starters we had the mushroom and bread, deviled eggs, chips and guacamole, and French fries. All tasted good! However I was disappointed when I received and tried the Asiago crusted halibut. The halibut was too buttery and dressed with too much cream and cheese. Overall nice ambience and place to go with friends or family."}
{"text":"Came here for the Mother's Day brunch. $24 sounded like a good deal but we walked in and there were so many flies all around the buffet food! Ick. Even despite that, the food was lousy and dry, the French toast tasted like sponge soaked in banana, and all of the baked goods were obviously frozen not fresh. I appreciate the customer service- especially the manager who refunded our meal when we pointed out the flies, but I will not be returning."}
{"text":"What a difference time makes. We visited this location a while back and although it wasn't horrible it also wasn't awesome. Tonight however it was simply amazing. The prime rib was so tender and literally was effortless to eat and the roasted fingerling potatoes with neckbone gravy absolutely heavenly. To top it all off our sever Holly was simply amazing. WE WILL BE BACK!"}
{"text":"Amazing food.  I just wish they we're more affordable.  I'd eat there a lot more often if they were."}
{"text":"Freaking fantastic!!!! Happy hour all day Monday! Everything was great, not one complaint."}
{"text":"Definitely recommend the Salty Sow. I had the bone in filets and they were delicious. The mashed potatoes were perfect. We had the beignets for dessert and I highly recommend them."}
{"text":"Love the Sow. We've been here many times. Really great food, service and atmosphere. Show me the pork!"}
{"text":"I love Salty Sow. Service and food are always top notch! The chicken thighs are my go-to, but the lamb burger is my second favorite. Brussels sprouts are a must and the duck fat fries are yummy. 

Salty Sow is where we take all of our out of town guests!"}
{"text":"I stopped in to try their new lunch menu, it's quite good. Several lunch staples and a few delicious twists as well. I had the BBLT,  and it did not disappoint.  Pork belly, bacon, fried green tomatoes, and an egg alongside cheesy grits. Most excellent!  Prices are average,  but no lunch specials per se. Worth checking out."}
{"text":"Me and a friend went for happy hour and dinner here at 5.30 and it was packed! very popular place and for all the right reasons. We asked for a table and they said 15 minutes so we grabbed a drink at the bar. It was crazy busy and we ordered a mule and a miss piggy to drink. Both good but I have had them before here and they didnt garnish them like they did before, probably because they were so busy. We had to go ask for our table 30 minutes later and got sat right away but it took another 10 minutes for a waitress to come, she was very busy but friendly and efficient. We grabbed another round and some appetizers which were delicious on happy hour the deviled eggs and the pate both were really good. For main we ordered the french dip and bacon and eggs. Both were delicious but very filling. We had the lemon bar for dessert and shared which was just right for two people. Also on Fridays they have live music which was really cool too. Definitely would go back just make sure you get there early!"}
{"text":"After reading what we thought were promising reviews, we decided to give it a try and we were not overly pleased. Staff was friendly, but that's all they really had going for them. Food wasn't that great. Salad was very basic. Duck fat fries were dry and not appetizing at all. Very overpriced for the quality you receive. Definitely will not be coming back, which is unfortunate because we live so close."}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink):
1 star:  Never again.
2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.
3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.
4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

This outpost of the Texas restaurant was a little disappointing given our expectation.  We were expecting something like the Pig & Pickle in Scottsdale, but though the interior is what I'd call, country-sleek, the feel of the place was more akin to a high-end Carraba's (albeit with better food.)  

Had the duck fat fries, the boudin fritters, brussels sprout caesar, and split the hanger steak.  And a couple beers, because it's a gastropub.

If I'm comparing this to other gastropubs or other smart casual restaurants, the food didn't stand out all that much to us.  The fries were fine, the boudin fritters a little less than fine, the salad was fine, and the steak was fine.  Everything felt a little heavy-handed and a tad over-seasoned.  We're definitely giving this place a second shot but not so sure we'd travel there regularly for the food."}
{"text":"Loved it here. We had the board for appetizer and all was amazing. Dirty martini with delicious blue cheese and bacon olives! Just amazing. I had the lamb burger. My son had the double cheese burger with bacon and pork belly! Great service. Live music!"}
{"text":"Even though our waiter stopped being so nice when he realized we were only there for drinks he was regularly attentive. 
I had the sangria which was AMAZING and enough of a taste of their style to make me look forward to my next visit~"}
{"text":"We got there just under 1 hour before closing time. We were worried that that we might get turned away, or that service would not be good, as often times restaurants start the cleanup process early.
But we were pleasantly surprised at how accommodating they were, and the good service. I had to be shoulder, and my ride had the pork. The beef shoulder was served and a skillet-like dish. The beef was set a time a helping of mashed potatoes with gravy. This created a stew like effect, which was very tasty.  we also had their version of a Moscow Mule, and a dark beer. All in all, it was a great experience."}
{"text":"Overall a decent G-Pub brought to you by Eddie V's restaurants.  

The good:  fresh brioche, tasty roast beef, juicy suckling pig, amazing 110 minute egg, beautiful decor, good location

The bad: Flour tortilla taco, not so interesting salmon rillettes 

The ugly:  Lame music, awkward service, limited menu

They put forth a good effort and I'm hoping Phoenicians will take to something besides your average boring Fox Restaurant Concepts fare.  I'd totally come in here to grab a beer and a nice charcuterie plate.  For the love of all that is holy, please play some interesting music.

And please, if I hear the term \"head (or snout) to tail\" or \"farm to table\" one more time I'm going to puke.  It's been done to death guys, and you're about 3 years too late.  I didn't experience one thing at the shop that would exemplify either concept."}
{"text":"Really delicious food.  We ordered the fish& chips, beef shoulder, crispy chicken thighs & crispy chicken sandwich.   All four of us were really happy.  Amazingly tasty and decadent desserts.  Attentive service. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Staying at the Embassy Suites looking for a nice place for dinner with a friend. I saw several options in the area however Salty Sow's decor and menu looked very inviting. Craving meat, there were a few options, one being the Lamb Burger. Excellent choice! So tasty and tender. Then bun was soft and buttery tasting. It comes with fries or a choice from the sides. You won't be disappointed.  No condiments needed! Perfect as served!"}
{"text":"No kids menu.  

I don't bring my kids.  Go to Happy Hour and get the Fried Chicken.  You will not be dissapointed.  

Go to reverse happy hour and get the $7 burger.  

Just go to Happy Hour."}
{"text":"I went here a few weeks ago and really loved the ambiance.  Though our stuffed mushrooms did not come out until after our meals were placed before us...well worth the wait.  YUM!  Our waiter was apologetic and pretty awesome overall.  A touch too much butter on the fish but our waiter was quick to bring me lots of lemon to cut through that issue.  Overall, I really enjoyed this fun, hip pig adorned establishment.  Texas gal felt happy and right at home.  TVs for golf and games, live band.  The staff from entery to exit...great energy.  Look forward to many yummy dining experiences.  Oddly, as we left, it became an insane microburst that soaked us to the bone in 10 seconds...Salty Sow experience was so good all this gal could do was dry down with a golf towle, wipe away the mascara, forget I was dry clean only and laugh my Salty Sow hiney off.  High to the Hog recommend for great food, fab staff and an overall great time.  Only thing that could have made it better?  Complimentary umbrellas!  It WAS raining pigs y'all!!!!  :)  YUM!!!!"}
{"text":"Super fun atmosphere and the happy hour selections are pretty stellar. While the apps (we tried the duck fat fries, pork taco, truffled deviled eggs, and rosemary honey fried chicken) were just a hair off in the WOW factor--just felt they needed one more step of flavor to get that oomph--the lemon bar dessert was worth it. It left my sister and I intrigued enough to come back for dinner, and leave feeling like one of the sow paintings on the wall--bellies to the floor."}
{"text":"I like this place.  They serve a decent selection of food and offer a nice group of cocktails too.  There is plenty of parking which is useful and the interior is big and airy.

I am particularly fond of their chicken liver pate, smooth and served with toast, I usually use my finger in the cute jar to get every last bit!  I also usually order the pork chop which is huge and tender.  My husband usually goes for the short rib with the fried egg on top.  

I recommend this place, not the cheapest but worth a visit.

Enjoy......"}
{"text":"Food was top notch. We ordered the French dip and rotisserie pork. No complaints. Drinks were good, too. Try the maple glazed old fashioned. The beers are all local brews. 

Service was inattentive. It didn't seem that busy, but he rushed us through ordering and would start walking away as we were finishing our order but still talking to him. He just made it feel like our presence was putting him out. 

Food was good enough that we'll try it again. The other server in our section seemed better."}
{"text":"Not too bad. Great service and atmosphere BUT the food is very heavy. SUPER delicious but not healthy food. This was my second time here. Both plates and appetizers were just too heavy and fattening. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star. Other than that great place. Just not for healthy eaters like myself."}
{"text":"This is our favorite restaurant in Phoenix and we've made it a tradition to come here every year. The service had always been top-knotch, the atmosphere is laid back, and everyone is friendly. We don't even need to look at the menu anymore. Everyone orders the French dip. It has ruined any other French dip for us. It is satisfying and delicious, we look forward to it every year. Fries also come with it, they are nice and crispy and have excellent flavor. I'm already making myself excited to go back next year! Drinks are also reasonable prices, especially during happy hour."}
{"text":"Noticed the great reviews.  I wanted to try the Rosemary honey chicken.  Went on their website and the happy hour price indicated $5.  Went in and the menu said $7.  I hate when restaurants don't update their online menu.  But the waitress did give us the online price. Everything we ordered was delicious.  Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, service and food. Nice Taplist of local craft beer- about half the taps are great.  Mostly geared towards lifter beers and could use a few more stouts or porters possibly but great overall."}
{"text":"A friend of mine has been talking to me about the Salty Sow for a few months now.  What took me so long?  The Pork Stew is Fabulous !  My sister took 2 servings home.  Our Server,Tony was outstanding!  The Wine he suggested, Troublemaker, was perfect!   Can't wait to back.  Taking my Husband SOON!   Thanks to my good friend, Chandler, for introducing me to my new favorite restaurant ."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my mom. Staff is very pleasant, great atmosphere, and appetizing menu. I ordered the Chicken Sandwich and ate the whole thing. My mom ordered the Cauliflower and Kale soup, she enjoys trying something new. The soup was extremely salty ( I tried it as well) and she ended up sending it back. She never does this.... :( She ordered a Garden Salad and was satisfied. We were not charged for the soup. The chef might want to go back and tweak the soup. Other than that we had a great meal. I would like to come back and try dinner here."}
{"text":"1st time here and it was really good. I am not a fan of Cauliflower but I loved their Cauliflower app. There was 6 of us and everything I tried at the table was really good. I had the French dip and that was amazing! One thing I wish that there was a little more variety on the menu. I know the smaller the menu the fresher everything will be, but a few more things could go a long way. Other than that this would be 5 stars. Great place, atmosphere was the best in Scottsdale for casual dining I felt. Loved the layout, and our server was really good. Tony was on top if it all and ran around like a maniac. That's how all servers should all be everywhere! Great Job Tony"}
{"text":"From the Salty Sow Restaurant in Phoenix... Triple Fried Duck Fat Fries with 110 minute egg and cold béarnaise...one of the most delicious guilty pleasures ever...I was so intrigued by the 110 minute egg I had to dig deeper and discovered an entire science behind the time and temperature of cooking eggs. Of course it all has to do with texture and what has been determined is that longer slow cooking in non-boiling water allows the egg yolk to take on the guise of other foods such as sweetened condensed milk, mayonnaise, honey, cookie icing and Marmite respectively.  The viscosity of the yolk is determined by the final cooking time...at 110 minutes the yolk resembles cookie icing. 
The fries alone were golden, crisp and had absorbed the flavor of the duck fat in a way that brings to mind and mouth the taste of that first bite of crispy duck skin at your favorite Chinese restaurant and pairing them with a chilled Béarnaise sauce that had just a touch of acid from the white wine vinegar was a great culinary choice. Add to this already decadent once-a-year treat the 110 minute egg and you have yourself an appetizer lifted from the ordinary to the spectacular. You hold your breath, break the quivering, golden yolk with your fork and then, letting your senses take over, double dip that fry into the Béarnaise and the Yolk...the mouth feel is one of cream, crisp and a touch acidic...you want to stop after a few because your inner voice is telling you this much goodness can't be good for you but you push on and make a deal with yourself to skip dessert...for the next year...just to have one more bite.  In honor of the Salty Sow I'm giving this dish 5 little piggy's..."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times and I'm not impressed. First of all, their website says they're located in Scottsdale. Wrong! This place is in Phoenix! Are they trying to be something they're not? Scottsdale prices that's for sure. 

Service has been mediocre every time. I ordered an appetizer and an entree and they came out at the same time. WTF? The prime rib was good, but it got cold sitting there as I was eating the appetizer. This place is too loud inside and the prices are too high. There are so many better places in Phoenix."}
{"text":"We typically come here for the best Happy Hour anywhere. We love their Austin location and are now torn between the two. We sat on the patio and Tommy, our waitstaff person, was super personable! We had the catfish tacos and being from New England my husband requested tartar sauce which was freshly made, great service. We always get the crispy brussel sprout salad that is probably one of our favorite dishes anywhere. Save room for the butterscotch budino, Yum!"}
{"text":"This place had a lot of pork type stuff (of course you knew that). So, bring one of the minority that isn't huge into bacon or pork, I had a long look at the menu before deciding on a burger for my dinner. It was good and very tasty, but the flavors are extremely savory. So you must be ready for that and possibly have a glass of water or something light to drink and not a heavy beer (which I ordered, of course). Alas, it was a decent date night place but not on my favorites list."}
{"text":"A fabulous and diverse menu with a pork centered theme and creative libations. The staff is fun and friendly as well! Be sure to ask for Tori...she's pretty awesome. Making a reservation is a great idea on the weekends. Saltysow.com Enjoy yourself!"}
{"text":"Love this place. It's expensive but the crispy brussel sprouts are out of this world. Highly recommend the trout. Best bet is to come at lunch or cash in at happy hour."}
{"text":"Ok, I am a huge fan of the other white meat and this place is all about it.  Or so they say, so I really wanted to like the pork here.   Well I can say after trying it, it was ok.  I never plan on visiting again so I can't say the dishes are making me want to visit.
Yes I tried the Lamb burger and ugh wish I could say it was excellent, but I would rate is as good.  
I like the local beers offered, even a replica of Blue Moon, but as noted with my dinner guest, wish I had a real Blue Moon to go with my pork :) It is not the same, it is a replica and the difference in flavor is noticed.  
Candied pork was ok, not something I would order again.  No starch on the plate with it so make sure you order something else.  
Great bar, great atmosphere, but the food is what attracted me and it was not top notch like I had hoped."}
{"text":"Oh WOW. This place is amazing. Visiting family in Arizona and used Yelp to find a good restaurant to take my daughter in law to for her birthday dinner. Picked the Salty Cow based and the menu and reviews. I'm here to tell you that this place is great. The service is top notch and the food is 5 stars also. The brussel sprout leaves are to die for. The Duck Fat fries are awesome. Me and the wife shared chicken and it was the bomb. Daughter ordered the pork belly....oh my...oh my... . My mom got the fish and loved it also. My son ordered the steak tacos, he liked them a lot. 
I'm pretty sure whatever you order you will love it. 

The Salty Cow was so good that we went back for our Christmas Prime Rib Dinner tradition. Once again we all looked at each other and shook our heads saying the same thing... It was probably the best price rib we have ever had. Mine is pretty good but man this was mouth watering. 

We were stuffed after eating our dinners and was asked about dessert. Butterscotch Budino.... GET IT . We were so impressed with the food we ordered 3 desserts . Needless to say we waddled out of there with smiles on our faces. Gosh it's good."}
{"text":"Couldn't be more impressed! Service is excellent, food is good and drinks are great!  This is a very well-managed restaurant.  Nice ambience and happy hour drink prices until 6:30 on Saturday.  Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"First off, the food here is fantastic and the only reason worth returning. The service and management though are absolutely careless and rude. They provide nothing to the dining experience and very obviously treated us as an inconvenience. As a restaurant manager myself, I was appalled at the accepted behavior of the staff in this building."}
{"text":"Let me get at those fried green tomatoes. The guac is bomb, their blanche frozen margaritas are great, especially with the chambord. I absolutely loved the French dip. Loved the fried chicken sticks with honey mustard. Pretty much loved everything. Only thing is that the deviled eggs are good but oh my goodness the flavor is so powerful and dominate that I can only eat half of one. Awesome atmosphere and just all around good time, I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem. Gastro comfort food. Outstanding quality food, drinks, and service. I'm a huge fan of their maple old fashioned and the beef shoulder."}
{"text":"first timers and WOW we will be back again want to try so many more things. we tried the Duck fat fries soooooo good we also had the truffle deviled eggs and the fried green tomatoes . the rotisserie pork was so tender . our waitress was very friendly . service all around was great"}
{"text":"My father is super picky..he likes all of 3 restaurants in this town...he LOVED this place. But it wasn't just the food...our waiter Tony was awesome. My dad turned to me and said: \"that's the kind of guy that gets a great tip even if the food is bad\" great decor, great menu..great drinks. excellent happy hour...I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Food and service were great! A couple of friends and I came in for happy hour and we pretty much tried everything on the food menu *oops*! I HIGHLY recommend the eggplant frites, truffled deviled eggs, and the honey Rosemary fried chicken! The cocktails were a little boozy, which makes for a better happy hour haha ;) The happy hour menu is a tad pricey but everything was delicious so we didn't have a problem paying over $70 for everything. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this restaurant which is so close to my house.  We parked the car and walked to the front door and before walking into the restaurant was greeted with protesters with pictures of pig guts and the heinous treatment of animals as well as the posters of meat is murder.  After entering we walked over to the bar and was promptly told by the hostess that she would be glad seat us.  I explained that we wanted to eat at the bar but she said she the are no open seats and she would seat us.  Once we were seated we were presented with menus.  I could only find two things that sounded appetizing.  When I asked the waiter do you have anything like a hamburger his response was no, but we do serve lamb burgers.    We finally settled on some chicken thighs and a piece of pork.  Food was good, but very expensive, and that was the happy hour menu.  I don't expect we will be back anytime soon.  Not our cup of tea."}
{"text":"I went in for dinner and had the French Dip and Creme Brulee for dessert.  Both items were very good!"}
{"text":"We went to Salty Sow on a weekday and were pleasantly surprised at the latest promotion - during the whole month of October it is buy one entrée get one free (during lunch Monday thru Friday). Score!
The ambience of the place is for meat lovers alike. Indeed, there is a huge wall that says \"Slow Cooking\" as well as pictures of hogs on the wall. I totally dig the meat loving vibes.
At the recommendation of my coworkers, we ordered the truffled deviled eggs and the crispy Brussels sprouts leaves. The Brussels sprouts were so crunchy and flavorful, we ate them up in no time. The deviled eggs, the yolk was so tasty, and the bacon was a nice compliment, too.
For our entrees, we all ordered different forms of meat. Mine happened to be the spicy chicken sandwich. All of our mouths dropped when it came out. This sandwich was HUGE! Not only was it super large, it was extra flavorful. The spice had a nice kick to it that wasn't overpowering at all; the chicken was cooked perfectly, and the coleslaw provided a nice neutral creaminess to it, too.
Overall, the food was quite impressive. I need to mark my calendar to go back before October is over!"}
{"text":"Met my dad here on a Tuesday.  It was happy hour - drink specials were great.  They had lots of app specials as well.  Deviled eggs were delicious.  I had the pork chops and I ATE THE WHOLE THING.  Dad had a burger that was huge but tasty.  Service was fantastic as well.  I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"First time and it was delightful!
Service was great , food was delicious .
Will be returning soon"}
{"text":"Had the ribeye because I'm not the biggest pork fan but my party was. My steak would be equivalent to Denny's, Friday's or any other cheaper chain. Thankfully it's about the sow."}
{"text":"Years ago this building was a Fuddrucker's, then it was a Chinese restaurant, and now it's Salty Sow. It is so nice in there. The effort put into the décor is awesome. It's a pleasure to eat dinner there.  The food is very good. The service is professional and I can't remember a time when the manager didn't come over and just check to see if everything was top notch. Drinks are good, food is good, atmosphere is good. Favorite dish, the P V salad."}
{"text":"Finally a restaurant in the PV area that rocks. I am a tough critic and this place pleasantly surprised me. Hubs and I went to the happy hour in the middle of the week and got the fried Brussels sprouts, pork belly taco, beef shoulder taco, kale chicken salad, the deviled eggs, and two brews on tap. Everything was just 5 bucks (except the salad) and let me tell you everything was delicious!!! MUST TRY! 

Also fantastic service, and really cool atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Three words: DUCK FAT FRIES. Best thing I have consumed in recent memory. Service was friendly and prompt and the decor is adorable. I had the blood orange serrano cocktail which was expertly crafted. The brussels sprouts are to die for also! Such a great place - I plan on eating here every time I'm in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of this place but last night the service was just terrible. Our waiter Michael was slow and inattentive, some food was overlooked. And the manager was not al that helpful or sympathetic. Hoping it was just an off night, but not wanting to go back for another bad experience."}
{"text":"Delicious place for foodies to go! Interesting menu with great specials that change daily!!"}
{"text":"Only have tried the chicken salad and of course the French FRIES Mmmmmmmmm the frenchie fries with the egg!!!! OMAGAWD so good. Did I mention the French fries?? French fries and cocktails. Perfect"}
{"text":"We always very much enjoy Salty Sow and were really looking forward to trying their Sunday Brunch for a special occasion. I called on Tuesday, May 10th and made reservations for 12:15 Sunday the 15th of May. They took my name and phone number and said everything is set. We arrived at 12:15 on Sunday to find them closed!  Evidently they decided to stop their brunch without telling people that had made reservations. Left me feeling not very warm to them!"}
{"text":"We have driven by this place several times, but today the husband said for us to give it a try. We were impressed and has been added to our good restaurant rotation. The atmosphere was very calm and quiet, even with a lot of people there. Perfect for the baby. The food was verry yummy. I recommend the fries and tacos. Very good place to eat and relax after a busy week. We will return"}
{"text":"I had heard good things about this place for awhile and I finally made it here. Now I see what people were talking about!

First of all great atmosphere. They have an awesome patio (with heaters for the chilly nights) that the side of the place opens up to. It's casual but feels a little more upscale. 

I was with two friends and everyone really enjoyed their meals. Beef shoulder, burger, nachos.. all were great. Server was nice, a little absent towards the end of the meal but she did a fine job. 

Happy hour menu looked good and extensive beverage list. I will definitely be returning as I saw several items on the menu I wanted to try!

On a weeknight the place was full. Not packed but few empty tables. 

I kept forgetting about this place since it's tucked back behind two other restaurants but a great gem in the sea of average chains among cactus rd."}
{"text":"I drove by this place many times and it never really stands out. One night i was on yelp and came across this place. Decided to start reading and research this place. It sounded interesting so i wanted to give it a try. A buddy of mine wanted to grab dinner so i said lets try the salty sow. the ambiance was different, but in a good way. Sat at the bar and ordered a drink. I forgot what it was, but it wasn't too bad. Unfortunately i wasn't too hungry so i just ordered the mini lamb burger off of the happy hour menu and i also wanted to try the duck fat fries that everyone talks about. Lamb burger was pretty delicious but the duck fries werent that great. My buddy got the tacos and he that they were delicious. Hes a hard very person to please, but he was impressed as was I.

I went back again a few days later with a different buddy of mine whos in the resturant business. He ordered the tacos too and he was impressed. I had the fried chicken and it was delicious! The touch of rosemary was refreshing in the chicken.

Im surprised that a restaurant like this is in this area. I would expect it to be somewhere closer to old town, they def dont get the recognition that they deserve. Everyone ive asked that lives in AZ hasnt heard about it, the Salty Sow should do some more advertising. This place really is a a real gem and i hope they stay for a very long time."}
{"text":"Love this place, and not just because it's 3/4 mile from my house:-) Glen is a great bartender, looking forward to the wife and I's next visit!"}
{"text":"Beautiful decor and a nice feel to the place. We went for lunch and it was not crowded at all. One of the servers stood and talked to the customers at the table behind us for our entire meal. She was so loud that it was incredibly annoying. Somehow I doubt the customers had invited her to join them for lunch. 
My husband said his burger was beautiful but had some grizzly chunks in it. My wine did not taste like the bottle had been opened today and at $9/glass for a $10/bottle value, it should have been better. Two stars for decor, an additional star because our server was OK. Probably too many other restaurant choices to return. Nothing incredible here."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The elegant but country decor is amazing! The food was perfect! Our waiter forgot about us but more than made up for it.. and its not about falling down its about how fast you get up! 

I had the Salmon blt and duck fat fries! I tried a Miss Piggy to drink and liked it so much I had another! Just call me Miss Piggy LOL 

I will be going back and taking friends!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. I can come in here for a charcuterie board (fancy for cheese and meat board), drink flight and desserts and be soooo happy. The live music is always fun. I am looking forward to coming in for lunch now that they are open."}
{"text":"Two of my friends brought me here while I was in town for business and what an amazing meal we had.  We started with the Charcuterie plate which had many house made meats of things I typically wouldn't eat but were prepared well and tasted amazing.  I then got the night's special of Duroc Pork Chop which I had never had before and the meat was much more tender and soft compared to a normal pork chop.  Our waiter was also very helpful and was very attentive to us and let us in on the history of the restaurant.  I will definitely come back when I'm in Phoenix again especially for the great value that they offer."}
{"text":"When I heard there was a pork joint coming to the area I was pretty excited.  We've probably been there a dozen times now which speaks for itself but at the same time it hasn't landed that final fifth star for me.  While the restaurant is practically in the Walmart parking lot you quickly forget that once you are inside.  A nice patio and live music on Th, Fri, and Sat also are a huge plus.  The majority of my meals have been solid but I can still remember having cold Berkshire pork which didn't kill the meal but did leave me a little disappointed.  That was probably 6 months ago and as I mentioned, we keep going back so take it for what it's worth.

On a side note who I presume is the restaurant manager normally makes a table appearance to check on your satisfaction.  Probably time we introduce ourselves which in past experiences usually ups the level of experience another notch."}
{"text":"I will have to agree with Jeff W. and Rebecca A. here. 

I was really excited to try this place as we are foodies and love trying new foods and restaurants. But I was very disappointed when we left. We ordered the charcuterie board which was just gross. Even the prosciutto didn't taste quite right and its like, how can you screw that up? This dish was the start of my queasy stomach. I had asked for another piece of toast as we still had cheese and meat left and was told we would have to pay for it! One piece of toast!

Next, we had ordered the Candied Pork Belly which literally made me sick to my stomach! I still feel queasy after eating here 3 hours ago! The pork belly is mostly all FAT and greas. The balsamic sauce it is drowning in is heinous and I'm not sure who's idea it was to mix the two. It comes with a small amount of collard greens soaked in the sauce which is a really cheap filler to this dish. Yuck!

I was hiding my distaste from the waitstaff because I didn't want to come across as rude to her but we wont be back. In fact we were never even asked how we liked our meal. There are just too many great Phoenix restaurants to waste fifty bucks on lunch at this place. Very pretentious for a Wal-Mart parking lot. 

Salty Sow, you better shape up or ship out cuz you've got competition in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"The food is outstanding! The environment is what you would expect from a Gastropub. I had the fish tacos, my wife had the prime rib! Both were fantastic. The menu had tons of awesome selections, it was difficult to choose! Awesome selection of beer! I enjoyed a limited time IPA. We live in the neighborhood and plan on coming back."}
{"text":"I like Salty Sow. It has a lot going for it, but there are issues.

The good? I love the atmosphere and the décor. I especially like it when live music is being played. A great vibe. Service is solid. No water glass will go unfilled in my experience. Reasonably priced happy hour apps...

The bad? Servers aren't particularly helpful with recommendations. Specials of the day are plopped on the table. The menu does have fun moments and is not totally dependent on pork, but liking pork helps. Descriptions tend to be more appealing than what is actually served. A happy hour app taco served this visit was among the grossest fluid filled messes I've ever experienced in a restaurant. A doble cheeseburger had mass quantities of beef, but not much in the way of flavor. And so it goes. If the food was served in a different environment you would think it was very pricey for what it was.

Will I return? Yes, on a Thursday... when music is playing. Alcoholic consumption also enhances the experience. Perhaps the Yelp average of four stars is right, but I can't get that taco out of my mind. Oh yes. The duck fat fries. They are good, but in the end they're just above average French fries."}
{"text":"The sow was such a wonderful experience,  poor Sean who has to put up with me on my 30 days no pasta, rice or bread lifestyle. Haha. Anddddd top it off I am a vegetarian. Anywho, this place reminds me of the deuce and yardhouse combine. I love it, and an open kitchen. It's great.

I started off with the eggplant frits as an appetizer. Holyyy moly of spongebobbbb. The taste was wonderful,  lightly breaded (cheat day) eggplant dipping it with marinara sauce and a mox with cholula hot sauce.. two thumbs up.

My entrée was the vegetable board minus the beets, and he substituted it with fried tomatoes.  I didn't like that so much. The kale salad was on par and I asked for an extras. Everything else was wonderful. 

Ill be coming back :)"}
{"text":"They are now dog friendly on the patio!!!!' I LOVE their happy hour menu and drinks, service is great- patio is to die for. They have live Music most nights on the patio but it was frustrating before they couldn't allow dogs- but now- 5 stars in my books they got dog friendly certified. Perfect date place, after work, or a fun/relaxing evening on the patio."}
{"text":"I had heard good and bad about this place but decided to give it a try. I must say that our server- Tony made the visit an exceptional one. His personality was wonderful and we tried everything  he suggested. We split the fish and chips and the pork sandwich. Both were delish. Also tried the butterscotch thingy for dessert and the banana beignets. I have never heard my husband utter the words- Oh wow when it came to a dessert but those banana goodies did it. So we will go back for more Tony soon!! Gotta try the brussel sprout dishes for sure."}
{"text":"Have so many nice things to say about this place.  Chorizo stuffed mushrooms were crazy good!  And the pan they were served in was perfect.  The duck fat fries were somewhat disappointing.  The soft poached egg was anything but.  Then I had the PV Salad.... I have had dreams about this salad.   It was, in my opinion, as close to perfect as a salad can get.  
Go eat here!!"}
{"text":"Overall, not great. 

The flavours are on point, but they miss after that. My burger and my wife's pork chop were both over cooked. 

I'd try it again, but certainly wouldn't rush back"}
{"text":"Came back here recently with my husband. As I self-suggested in my original review, I skipped the fries and ordered a different drink. Good choice!

We started with the eggplant frites (got much more than I expected) and the stuffed mushrooms for starters and they were both great. Especially the mushrooms. 

He got the lamb burger and I got the pork medallions. He said his burger was pretty good (but like me, he wasn't keen on the fries), and my pork was *amazing*.  Just fantastic. 

We also got drinks. A mojito for him and copper state mule for me. Both were surprisingly good!

We shared a crem brulee as well, and it was good!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. No one had any idea what was going on. Overpriced. Everything took FOREVER to come out. Will definitely not return."}
{"text":"Really good prime rib 
Service was lacking a little. Very nice but not attentive. 
      Ex: we did not get a. Steak knife with our dinner. We asked the waitress for one, and it took too long so we decided to go up to the kitchen and grab one ourselves. However people make mistakes and forget."}
{"text":"Hands down this place has the most character in the neighborhood. All the food was fantastic, nice selection of local craft beers, really friendly staff who all seem to help each other out to make sure we were well taken care of."}
{"text":"We moved to the neighborhood and Salty Sow is my new guilty pleasure.  Their menu has a lot of fun yet wholesome items that I can't get enough of.  Both myself and The Boy were surprised by their brussel sprout Caesar salad.  The dressing has the right amount of bite and the crispy brussel sprout leaves give it a nice bump in flavor.

Speaking of the crispy brussel sprout leaves, if you are a brussel fan, these are a must get. I was also super impressed by their smashed Yukon gold potatoes.  Even though I HATE the phrase \"smashed potatoes\", I can overlooked it at Salty Sow because these smashed babies are delicious.

The Boy had their Hot Chicken sandwich and was pleased. The sandwich came out and it was HUGE!  I had their prime rib special which on Sundays is half price. It comes with a side salad and the smashed Yukon golds and even at full price is a great deal.  The pork belly and cheese grits is a must try if you are a bacon fan.  I am not a fan of their happy hour food.  The pork belly taco and fried chicken are just meh. Dat biscuit tho, with the fried chicken, needs to be added to the menu because it is bomb!

Service in the dining room has been awesome but at the bar it's so so. The male bartender is not very attentive unless you are a regular.  The ambiance is awesome, the patio is spacious and I can't wait to try the seats by the kitchen.  The kitchen staff has a fun dynamic (from what we could see from the dining room) and it would be fun to have a front row seat.  Their music selection is an awesome mix of songs that has never constantly remarking, wow, this is SUCH a good song!"}
{"text":"This has become our neighborhood go-to. We love to stop here for dinner during the week. They have a great happy hour, pretty awesome selection of beer & wine, and the food is consistently delicious. Our favourite bartender remembers us and what we like to drink which makes us feel really welcome and at home. Great spot."}
{"text":"Where to start? Let's start with one on my favorites, the pastrami salmon.  The flavor confusion between the expected salmon-- yet infused with pastrami flavorings is not to be missed. 

Second course, stay on the appetizer menu and top off the meal with green chili stew and a side of roasted Brussel sprouts. What more do you need?"}
{"text":"We have dined here a few times.  Tonight was blissfully delicious.  The bone-in filet was wonderful and the wine bone marrow mushroom sauce was heavenly.  My husband always gets the crispy chicken and fried smashed fingerling potatoes - I have tried it and he is right - it is that good.  Our server, Michael was delightful, helpful, and as it was a slower night - we enjoyed chatting with him.  He steered us true and we ordered the buttermilk pie for dessert.  So so good.  And, they make a great martini to boot.  

Great dinner and great job to the Salty Sow Chef and staff."}
{"text":"I tried to make reservations for Mother's Day a week in advance and the person who answered the phone said they weren't taken reservations. We were going to be a party of 6-8 with my elderly parents and I figured it would be better to have reservations since I had family from out of town and I knew they had limited seating for handi-capped since I have been to the Resturant twice and liked the food. We're told they did take reservations when we got there way before the rush but they could not accommodate us since all the seating that was available was high tops obviously not good for elderly people to jump on to. They were not curtious about it at all. Maybe the staff should be better informed and also learn better manners."}
{"text":"Love this spot! Awesome Happy Hour (don't miss the tacos!) and made chicken thighs something I actually crave!  Creative chef, friendly staff, and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I enjoyed very single item we ordered! I ordered chicken liver, fried chicken and duck fat fries from HH menu and my boyfriend got the beef shoulder(a little bit salty but still very tasty).chicken liver is my favorite and they gave me extra bread to go with my leftover! Will definitely go back again"}
{"text":"What can I say- I love this place. 
I'm a frequent visitor to Scottsdale and I usually find myself here for dinner. Their food is great and what I really love is that everything on the menu just hits every note of YES. It's tough to decide what to order. Their daily meat and cheese plate is awesome always. The banana beignets are literally one of the best desserts I've ever had. The fried chicken is bomb-tastic. Their stuffed mushrooms are little mouth-gasms. Their drinks are ah-mahz-ing. I haven't tried anything here I didn't like. THUMBS UP!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been visiting The Sow since they opened, generally the food is delicious. However, recently their food quality has gone down.  I ordered the fried chicken and biscuits, and the chicken was not completely cooked.  Additionally, the roast beef sandwich was not as rare as I remember it being which was disappointing because that is one of the non-modifiable items.  That sandwich had so much more flavor when it was nice and rare.  The tacos on the lunch and happy hour menu are still the best for continuous quality."}
{"text":"The husband and I went to Salty Sow for happy hour a couple days ago and it was overall very good. I had been to the Yelp elite event here earlier this year and liked it very much, unfortunately, this place is nowhere near where I live so I hadn't been back. Aaanyway, the specials for happy hour include 5$ apps and 2$ off wine and cocktails. I had the sangria (very good, somewhat sweet but not too sweet) and the drink with the ruby red deep eddy vodka.... I forgot what it was called, but it was herbacious and tasty. We split the fried chicken app with the biscuit... the biscuit was delicious, but the chicken was a little on the sweet side. It was good overall, but I don't know that I would order again. We also shared the budino, which was so good at the elite event. It was still very delicious, but tasted like it wasn't made that day... it was a little liquidy on the bottom and the whipped cream wasn't as soft as it normally is... pretty sure it had been made the day before or a couple days before that. As I said, it still tasted good. I would definitely come back if I were in the area, especially for happy hour. 


PS - the one bummer of hh (and the whole menu, actually) is that the majority of their food come with an egg on it (which I love, but the husband is allergic to eggs so it limits his options, and I know that they would probably leave the egg off if requested, but it takes away some of the intended flavor/texture of the dish). 
PPS - They have all day happy hour on Mon and tues... nice!"}
{"text":"What??? Serving lunch?  Book it baby!  Had a delicious Crispy Fried Chicken Sandwich and Duck Fat Fries today. PERFECT service from Joey. Great menu with reasonable prices. Indulged in the Creme Brûlée and Chocolate Torte, which was more like a dense delish dark chocolate cheesecake. So happy that their lunch equals their fabulous happy hour. I may have to hang out here all day!"}
{"text":"My family has been in here a bunch. I've been forgetting to review. Happy hour is the best. Duck fat fries are just delish. Basically great menu and great customer service. Great drink selection. And despite not being a kid friendly place. My son does really well there. They have a grilled cheese sandwich that he loves. It's not on the menu but if you ask them you shall receive. Dessert is a MUST. You can't go wrong here. They also have live music which is great."}
{"text":"We've been looking forward to trying this place for months and it did not disappoint. So tasty we came back two days in a row."}
{"text":"My fav place to eat in North Phoenix! Food and service is always on point. The General Manager Kevin, is the best!"}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal!!

Great food! Great local beer and awesome service.

Get the Lamb Burger!!

My favorite restaurant in Phoenix by far!"}
{"text":"New to the area from Seattle Washington. I attended brunch yesterday with my colleagues. I was blown away by the quality of the food. The server Joey was phenomenal she was on top of her service with nothing short of amazing experience!! The GM was aware and walking around making sure everything was to his standards, the environment was very inviting, with a bridal party out on the patio, and cute families were enjoying themselves too! So yes, it is a family friendly environment as well! I have a recommend you come by, you will not be disappointed! I'll definitely be back with my daughters soon!"}
{"text":"This is among the best managed restaurants in town.  I've been here 18 times.  Every time I get great food and awesome friendly service.  I've been in this industry and as you can see from my other reviews I am not easy to please.  Guaranteed you will not be disappointed at the Salty Sow.  Five stars even from the most discriminating critics.  Thanks Sabrina Brady Brenda and Antonio.  You all are men among boys."}
{"text":"We went to the Salty Sow for Mother's Day brunch and had never been before so was not sure what to expect.  It was a buffet and every single food item was DELICIOUSLY AMAZING!!  There was a great variety of breakfast/lunch food and the price was so reasonable.  Almost better than the food was the service.  The hostesses, our waiter, other waiters, all of the chefs (it is an open concept kitchen so you can chat with the chefs) were OVER THE TOP friendly and accommodating.  I can not wait to go back for dinner very soon as I hear the dinner is even better - not sure how that can be possible.  You should try this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Have never been disappointed. The green chili stew is the best in town and the guacamole is so fresh, that it's hard to share! Hands down, the best gem in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Very good food and great service. We came here with some friends that recommended it to us a while back, finally they had enough waiting and took us.

For appetizer, we ordered the chorizo stuffed mushrooms and they were VERY good. It came with some delicious bread (really good bread)

For my meal, I ordered the Roast Beef french dip and it was delicious. A lot of meat, great portion, the au jus was also spot on.

We will be back to try some new things on the menu"}
{"text":"I'm always a big fan of Salty Sow. Food is always great and they have an awesome Happy Hour. Their live music is always nice and I think they have an amazing ambiance. Probably one of the top restaurants around the 85254 area code."}
{"text":"Great environment! Really great food! I live right around the corner and will definitely becoming back! Thank you! Tip: order the deviled eggs..soooo delicious!"}
{"text":"Went there to celebrate our daughter's 36th bday.  It was during brunch.  She and her friends had been there and said the food and service were excellent.  It was a buffet.  Ok.

Well, our servers didn't really give us good service (something even our daughter and her friends were aghast about) and to be quite frank-the food was mediocre.  

I have a dairy allergy-which made it almost impossible to really get a true feel for the place.  Décor was fun and welcoming, chairs on the patio where they put the 10 of us were comfortable.

But when you spend $25 for a buffet and not even coffee and tea are included and most of the foods are covered in cheese and contain the food you are allergic too, it was extremely overpriced.  Add the bad service and I'm sure you get the idea.
For my $33 tab I ate:  2 egg white veggie omelet, 1/2 stale bagel w/ homemade jam, some fresh berries, 1 slice of bacon.  I suppose if I were a bigger eater I could've tried the carving station pork loin or the dried out and rather burnt looking sausage \"balls\" (they weren't patties and they weren't links).  Pastries were there, but obviously another area I couldn't try.  

Would I go back?  NO.  The biggest offenses being the waitstaff and the price.  Literally could've gone to Eggstacy (which we love) and had a much better meal for half the price."}
{"text":"As a native Texan, I find this place reminds me of home.  Their collard greens are better than my Grandmother's.  The pork belly is OMG amazing.  Love the unique cocktails with my favorite being the Curly Tail which has chili peppers frozen into the ice cube so your drink gets spicier as you drink it.  The PV Salad is easily one of the best salads I have ever eaten in my life.  Outstanding service, delicious food, casual yet upscale vibe.  What's not to love?"}
{"text":"Happy hour on a Saturday was excellent. We enjoyed their discounted house wines and draft beers, $5/$7 small plates, and the charcuterie board of the day. Our server was very patient with us and didn't rush us at all during our very long dining experience. She also had all sorts of recommendations to enhance our tastings.

I highly recommend the fried chicken and the brussel sprouts small plates (OMG).

Best way to approach this place is probably with friends so you can try (almost) everything on their small plates menu. This is not your typical \"one appetizer and a dinner entree per person\" kind of place. Step outside of the box and give it a try!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here twice in the last few months for Sunday brunch. Love the variety of options and freshness of all the brunch foods! Brunch is a little pricey but it's good food for the price. My favorite is the pork belly with a side of chimmichurri sauce. So delicious! The Bloody Mary bar is a pretty cool idea too."}
{"text":"I've only ever been here for their all-you-can-eat brunch, but it's truly amazing. Service has always been okay and the environment is nice, but the real reason I come here is for the friend chicken and other breakfast items.

It's too bad they only run the buffet during certain times of the year!"}
{"text":"We've been to salty sow before and always enjoy our experience. It's been a while but we got a babysitter lastnight and decided that salty sow would be the place to go for our date night.

We had a wonderful experience and all the food was delicious as usual! My husband had the pork belly and I snacked on the brussel sprouts and buratta. We enjoyed the creme brulee for dessert!"}
{"text":"First Time here and been wanting to stop in and check this place out for a long time. Sat up at the bar and it was greeted by a fantastic bartender Angela. She really knows what she is doing, very helpful outgoing friendly intelligent and suggestive on many items. Exactly what you want for a new spot that you want to know more about. Excellent spot and we'll be coming back for more for sure. Keep up the great work Angela. :-)"}
{"text":"It was our first time there so we tried a bit of many things. The food was all served piping hot and fresh. It was overall a good place to dine and I could see it being a local favorite. We did make reservations though they weren't needed at the time we arrived. It was fun to see inside the kitchen and the server was kind."}
{"text":"Way over priced for a \"healthy Burger\" on a camping pan with skinny fries that are sprinkled with elegant parsley.. Ordered a Milkshake that came in a plain plastic clear cup. Guess how much? $6.00!!! Soupy Shake that I could have got down the road 1/2 block with a big M on the sign for less then $2.00. 
Everybody's got a gimmick when your new trying to reinvent the wheel on something like a Burger. Unfortunately, your going leave here after eating a 3.5\" inch burger & fries for 2 for about $40-45 with tip. Not my idea of the ultimate burger experience. I have not had happy hour yet, so maybe this will be one of the many where I come for the drinks and eat somewhere else. Bulls, Bears make-money- (PIGS & SOWS) get-slaughtered....I'm feeling Mexican in this zip code...."}
{"text":"I CRAVE the Truffled Deviled Eggs and Brussel Sprouts! Everything I've had on this menu is to die for!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday night, it was very packed. We had a table of 6 so we waited about an hour to be seated. Got sat, waited about 12-15 minutes before we even saw our server. She was obviously frazzled and made no attempt to hide it. Brought our drinks out promptly, we only waited about 15 minutes for our food. I ordered the double cheeseburger. It was juicy, but there was no sauce. It was all meat and bread, no hint of cheese or flavor. The duck fat fries were good. My friend had to ask for different fries & fish as hers were cold. They didn't give us any qualms about it and brought the hot food out shortly. Our server just was not friendly at all the entire time we were there. I understand the pressure & stress that comes with serving, but there also is being professional and not allowing your stress to affect your customer service. The service & food were both very mediocre for the price. Won't be returning here again."}
{"text":"Everything we ate was delicious. Service and atmosphere was great. Quickly went into my top 5 valley restaurants for date night."}
{"text":"We had the $5.00 Happy Hour Specials and they are all amazing. We tried all of the tacos on the menu, all delicious, I was a little afraid I wouldn't care much for the fried egg on top but it just added to the flavors and I'm a fan. The crispy fried chicken in rosemary and honey is a meal in itself and delicious.It comes with a biscuit and that would be my only complaint the biscuit was dry, not flaky. The white sangria was addictive it was so good! We finished off the meal with the apple pie which was an actual small pie, so definitely made for sharing and can  be shared with 3 or 4 people, it comes with a huge scoop of their homemade vanilla ice cream which easily stands on its own due to it's rich and creamy texture."}
{"text":"We decided to try this restaurant on Labor Day, as they were running a buy one, get one free on entrees and all day happy hour. I booked a reservation for 5:00.

The restaurant was very busy, but we arrived at 5:00 and were promptly seated.  The hostess thanked us for making a reservation.  Our waiter was wonderful.  Even though they were very busy, he took his time to explain everything and made sure that we understood all the items available at a discount.  We ordered drinks, appetizer, entrees and a dessert and the timing of the meal was perfect.  The food was wonderful, and even as busy as they were, arrived perfectly cooked.  And I loved that the bus boy did not take my plate until my hubby was done with his too (pet peeve of mine).  We were never left waiting for the \"next step\" in our meal.  

We will definitely be back.  The atmosphere is nice, not too loud, and doesn't feel crowded at all, even when super busy.  Thanks."}
{"text":"Great new Gastropub in Paradise Valley (PHX). Lively, creative food and great drinks and wines. Don't miss it. Get reservations."}
{"text":"Dee-licious. If you count calories, knock it off and EAT HERE! Just delectable home cookin'-driven menu, good cocktail menu (although with so many \"Southern\" inspired items like Beer Battered Fish, Slow - cooked Beef Shoulder, and Bacon Butter Pork Chop Stack they should have more than one whisky craft cocktail)... Friendly and timely service. Excellent draft beer offerings since they're all AZ!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Like one of the other reviewers wrote, many of the items on the menu are for adventurous diners, which is exactly what I was after!

In all honesty, I had every intention of trying multiple courses, but there were too many tasty looking starters that we just ended up ordering 4 apps and drinks between two of us, which were all great. Days later, I can't stop thinking about the duck fat fries and can't wait to go back to try some entrees."}
{"text":"Great concept/wrong location. Great happy hour & atmosphere. Should have done hopdoddy here :/"}
{"text":"This was great. This restaurant is so pretty inside, and service is very, very good.

Definitely stop in for happy hour. The small plates are reasonably priced, and it's fun ordering several things and sharing with everyone. Love, love, LOVE the duck fat fries. They're delicious, and the egg on top is like icing on the cake. Seriously, where have these fries been all my life?

Truffled deviled eggs are very good. Crispy chicken thighs are fantastic. If you like fried chicken, get this. The thighs are moist, fried perfectly, and just fantastic. Crispy brussel sprout leaves are a nice side to accompany the chicken.

Only thing I would skip are the eggplant fries. They're tender, but they lack flavor. The breading needs some work. They're a good portion size, but I was disappointed, especially since I love eggplant.

For dinner, I had the fish special, and it was amazing. I want to say it was trout. Even if you aren't huge on fish, it's worth gambling to see how good Salty Sow can cook it up.

This place is worth the drive if you don't like in Scottsdale. Cannot wait to go back and eat half the menu."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed my meal at the Salty Sow in North Phoenix. I arrived during Happy Hour, but I was immediately drawn to two items not on the HH menu. First was the Bacon & Gruyère Crusted Bone Marrow. This was fantastic. I could have just eaten that all night. Yet there was an item on the specials menu that I couldn't pass up: Porchetta Cuban Panini.

Now, I believe there is only one perfect sandwich on this planet: The Cubano Mixto. Salty Sow's Panini sandwich is a very tasty homage to this heavenly pressed sandwich of pork, ham, cheese, pickles, and mustard. They also added onions, but this can be forgiven. ;-) What made this sandwich amazing was their use of the porchetta and un-cured ham. As a special item, I didn't know how often they featured it, and I am very glad I tried it.

The sandwich also came with their famous Duck Fat Fries. On this, I have to admit I don't understand why everyone raves about them. Are they delicious? Oh most definitely. Best pommes frites I think I've had. But that's sort of my point. They are just fries. Duck fat seems to bring nothing but maybe some extra crispiness to them. If you didn't tell me they were fried in duck fat, I'd think they were just fries. So, while very tasty, and unique as a side dish, I think this is really a novelty that one could eat once and then move on. In contrast, others might think the bone marrow is a novelty, but I would disagree and insist that they are worth the trip to Salty Sow alone.

So, after two regular prices items, the bill was hefty. More than I'd usually pay, however both items were great and unusual so I can't fault them.

I really only have ONE complaint: their hours. I'm only half-joking. They don't open until 4:30 PM. I have lived in this area almost two years and I have only just been to the restaurant for the first time tonight, because every time I've driven by until now, they have been closed, or very busy. Please, consider opening for lunch. Serve your Happy Hour menu as Lunch specials and I think everyone would be ecstatic. I know I would be."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink and quick bite to eat. Been here once before briefly. Like the atmosphere and sat and that bar. I was greeted right away. The waitress let me know it was happy hour...on sat? Awesome!

Ordered the Moscow mule as it was my first one ever...so good!!! I had two lol also had the truffled deviled eggs and crispy Brussels sprouts which were delish! 

Loved the classic rock music too :)"}
{"text":"We met some friends here for some food and drinks. It was a suggestion of mine being that the wife and I had a really good experience here the first time we stopped in. 

The food once again was amazing!! More than pleased with our selections.
Here is what we ordered:
- Pork Belly
- Duck Fat Fries
- Honey Rosemary Dipped Fried Chicken (this is a must try)
- Pork Belly Taco
- Spit-Roasted Pork Taco
- Cornmeal Fried Catfish Taco

Only suggestion I have is for the Bar. Gotta rotate the beer selection a little more."}
{"text":"ok, so consistency is key in this day and age, so I went to SS 4.... no 5 times before putting this in writing.

first visit:  amazing
second visit: not amazing
third fourth and fifth visits: back on top.

my second visit was un amazing enough to delay review because I really want this place to rock it.  if I was less dedicated, I may have given a lower score at visit two, and that would have been the end if it.

however, such is not the case, and im happy to say I keep going back because they have found their groove at the salty sow.  the operation is solid. 

deviled eggs:  amaze-balls
pork taco at happy hour: a perfect meal for one
roasted bone marrow: tickle your garlic butter fetish"}
{"text":"Amparo is a great server! For a Friday night, they were on top of the game. They sat us on time for our reservation & the mood was excellent. My pork belly was overcooked but it was handled perfectly by both Amparo and management. They also have one of my favorite beers on tap so that is a plus. The live music is the cherry on top! We will be back"}
{"text":"Things at Salty Sow you need to eat before you die:

Fried Green Tomatoes (come with guac)
Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms
Cheese Grits
Crispy Brussels Sprouts

I can't even tell you what their entrees are like because I blackout from a food high on appetizers alone, but I've heard great things about their fried chicken.
They have a great HH on Monday nights, awesome patio and live music though I forget which days. This is always a place I introduce to family or friends from out of town for good vibes, great food and an awesome Dirty Martini."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of Windsor in Phoenix quite a bit, but I think has a bit more of an exciting and diverse menu (Windsor has great food, but I find the menu a bit limited). It's really cool to have a place like this in North Scottsdale, when most of the hip new places seem to be in the Arcadia area. The stand out dish here for us is easily the Crispy Brussels Sprout leaves. They are fried up to a nice crisp and tossed with golden raisins, pecorino, and something else sweet which I couldn't put my finger on. They are LEGIT. If you don't like Brussels Sprouts, they will change your mind. 

Service was A+, food was great, very nice and chic decor...overall I was extremely impressed. 

Judging by the crowds I've been seeing here, I think most people tend to agree as well.

{"text":"My fiance and I ate here last night and I was reminded why I love it. Their menu is unlike most menus in the Valley. There are an assortment of things I normally would not try but somehow the folks at Salty Sow know how to make them taste just right. Last night I had their porchetta sandwich which was a special for that evening. The sandwich was huge, in fact I could only eat half, which meant the other half went with my very happy fiance to work today for lunch. It might have been big but it was really, really tasty. We also shared the brussel sprout leaves as an appetizer. You heard right. Leaves. There are pieces of brussel sprouts and some brussel sprouts leaves all baked and crispy with an incredibly sweet sauce smothered on top of them. If you go there -- you have to try them. I'm not usually a huge brussel sprouts fan but these are incredible. For those with adventurous appetites, this is your spot! They also had fun cocktails on their menu. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Really tasty plenty of food and reasonable prices. I'll be back, often."}
{"text":"I cannot wait to get back here and try a few more tasty nuggets from their inventive and delectable menu! Great service, loved the indoor-outdoor ambiance, and the guitar player on the patio was amazing. Our server hinted that our party of four might want to graze our way through the menu and she was right. We sampled the Fried Green Tomatoes & Guacamole (super spicy); the Duck-fat Fries (amazingly crispy and flavorful); the crispy Brussels Sprouts (OMG yum!); the Green Chile Pork Stew (super flavorful and not too spicy); the roasted organic beets (tender and fresh); the white corn cheese grits (with a 110 minute egg on top... just do it!); and the fresh fish (to die for.) Are you hungry yet?? You should be and don't dilly dally about getting over there for a wonderful evening. Their cocktails are refreshing too - loved the sweet maple bourbon and the blood orange margarita. No room for dessert, but next time I'll try harder - loved it."}
{"text":"Salty Sow? What the heck is a Salty Sow? Apparently (after looking it up), it's an adult female pig.  Ohhh, makes sense.  Their specialty is in PORK.  Which I regrettably did not order but will next time. 

What appealed to me at the time was this crispy chicken over fried potato dish.  It was fantastic times 100.  I never had chicken this way before.  Basically its two big chicken thighs where the skin was rendered giving it a crispier texture.  The fingerling potatoes were fried and doused into brown gravy, which then completed the whole dish.  I killed it! Was sooo good!

I did manage to sample a little bit of pork belly my amigos had.  I thought it was juicy and succulent the way it ought to be.  

The menu offered some really creative dishes at an affordable price.  When you sit down and gaze at the decor, you thought you might be spending in the 20s but not really.  Ranchy chic is how I would describe the decor.  

Now that I finally gave them my thumbs up, I need to plan another visit."}
{"text":"Underwhelmed.  Service was very slow.  Ordered duck fat fries that came with cold hollandaise and were caked in salt.  Crispy chicken thighs were anything but crispy and cauliflower rice casserole was soupy with minimal barely cooked rice.  They lived up to the name though with all dishes being really salty.  Restaurant is pretty and could be very nice with some changes to the kitchen."}
{"text":"Terry T took me here as an early birthday present and I can' wait to go back!

We started with the crispy Brussels sprouts which are sort of like kale chips in texture, but have that terrific flavor of Brussels sprouts. The lamb burger I had was fantastic. Perfectly grilled and paired with the fries made for a fantastic dinner.

Thx, TT!!"}
{"text":"For starters they have happy hour everyday!  Pretty great. Had the chicken as an appetizer you must try it- will not disappoint. The. The green chile bowl & pork  bomb - food was so great."}
{"text":"My husband and I met some friends a few months ago at this establishment, and we were certainly disappointed. The ambiance was nice, but the food always takes center stage in our opinion, and this food wasn't Center Stage. It is still waiting in the wings to become better. We hope it does become better, because we like the location and be Ambiance was very nice."}
{"text":"New favorite spot! Can't wait to bring my husband here because he's going to love it!! 

Came here with my mom and we both fell in love with this place. Our entire dining experience was fabulous from start to finish.

Let's begin with dessert - - because who doesn't love dessert?!? We split the beignets and they were to die for! We were literally \"oohing\" and \"ahhing\" as we devoured them. When you take a bite, lo and behold you encounter perfectly caramelized bananas foster. Paired with the crispy dough of the beignet it's spectacular. My mouth is watering just thinking about them. As if that isn't enough, they serve them with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. AND the portion is huge -- they tempt you with not one, not two, not three, but FOUR large beignets! This is a dish that four people could split. Well, the two of us tore them up and ate all four. (They wouldn't be good as leftovers...or at least that's what we told ourselves.)

We must've been hungry or tempted by their menu because we still made it to dessert despite splitting several appetizers and sharing an entree. 

Let's talk appetizers. Stuffed mushrooms -- so good I was dipping the bread they served them with in the butter, garlic sauce. Fried green tomatoes with guacamole - win; plus, who can pass on that amazing combo. Duck fries - super yummy and the sauce they came with was awesome. 

After all that, we split the beef shoulder entree. It was so soft, tender and the mashed potatoes and roasted root vegetables were perfect. 

Food and service alone were five stars. I also love the decor because everything is tastefully themed with pigs (\"sow\"). Even the restrooms have cute decals, one with a pig in red heels and one with a boar. 

I had such a great dining experience here! Next time, I can't wait to try their award winning deviled eggs. I'll be sure to leave room for dessert again!"}
{"text":"I've only been here once.  Our server was not very good.  We already had waited 10 minutes with no one greeting the 3 of us at the table....the table next to us not only had an attentive server, but the manager stopped by a couple of times to see how they were doing and to bring out their entree's.  We agreed that we'd wait 2 more minutes before getting up and leaving.  After making eye contact with quite a few servers and bussers, as we were about to get up, our server came - without an apology, she asked what she could get us to drink.  We obliged and ordered.  After another 10 minutes, our drinks came.  

For food, I ordered the beef shoulder that had a great presentation but it was a bit heavy.  I wasn't able to finish it.  My brother had the duck breast, and though I don't eat duck, he insisted I try it - it was better than my beef shoulder.  My SIL ordered the same thing I did, so nothing extra to comment on that.  The service throughout our meal was yet again, next to none.  We had to ask every time we wanted our drinks refilled - she never came by to ask how our meal was.  And when we did ask for refills, we actually felt bad because she made it seem like we were inconveniencing her.  

You know how it goes....whenever you receive bad service, it's almost hard for the food to taste good - you're just so bothered by the service that it doesn't matter.  To the point you just don't want to eat anymore.  I was really excited because we finally had a \"trendy\" restaurant in our area besides all the corporate (Olive Garden, Oreganos, etc.)  restaurants, but it looks like this one isn't a winner."}
{"text":"Chef Brady & GM Kevin...Killed it! Cool spot, amazing food and stellar service. This is why PHX is blazing the culinary trail! Beef shoulder, omg, to die for...green chili stew, off the charts authentic and fried green tomatoes done perfect! 

Seriously...spot is humming but not obscenely loud, no wait, but full bar and a lot happening. North Scottsdale, this is our spot!"}
{"text":"First time for me at the salty sow, I'am pleased to say I was impressed with the service and the food! I had the 12oz prime rib with mashed potatoes and house salad. Also, the shaved Brussels sprout salad was very good. I would go again for sure."}
{"text":"Eye catching building structure from the street from what use to be a Black Eye Pea and then a Chinese Buffet.

Ordered a few different items to share and taste. Had the Lamb Burger, French Dip, Duck Fat Fries and 2 different tacos. Lamb meat was stronger than what I was expecting, if I am going to spend $14 for a burger would rather go to Zinburger or the Grind. The French Dip was good but our standard for excellence is at Hillstone/Houston's. The Tacos were average but different with the Pork Belly Taco with Egg was a little dry and plain but the Suckling Pig Taco was better with the salsa. The most enjoyable item was the Duck Fat Fries which were crispy while not over cooked. Was trying to get in and out to catch a movie but could not get prompt enough service and did not make the movie in time. Have to think if I would come back again. So many other places to try out first."}
{"text":"I work and live right up the street and it's not even close the best place for happy hour! Don't even question it! Love going there with buddies and hanging with a sophisticated crowd."}
{"text":"I finally went here after hearing about it for some time and... was let down. We came on a Saturday night at 8. I ordered the green chili stew and it was gross; too much cheese made it oily, the tortillas were thin and poor quality when they split when I rolled them. There was nothing (think onions, tomatoes) that came with the dish like normal. Just meat and dry tortillas.

My daughter got the cheese burger and it was a bun and burger with NOTHING on it, they literally do not have fresh anything, tomatoes or lettuce to put on it. I had to request mayonnaise and ketchup. I also asked for tomatoes, onions and lettuce and said I'd pay extra but they just don't have them. Weird. They did have broccolini which was pretty good. We wanted chips and salsa as we ordered the guacamole/chips and they don't even have salsa! I recommend a restaurant of their size, charging as much as they do, focus on providing the basics. Think of doing more than bare minimum to make a dish passable as what diners expect to receive. Omitting expected things from a menu doesn't make a restaurant unique or quirky; it makes it seem low budget, low quality and cheap. Think about adding salsa, fresh fruits and vegetables. My friend ordered the tacos  and said they were really spicy. I rank the service as a little less than average as the wait for drinks and ordering took longer than expected. 

The patio is fun with tall picnic benches and sparkly lights hanging above. The margarita was good. Very nice ambiance, I recommend going here for happy hour but don't expect a fine dining experience. Above average bar food."}
