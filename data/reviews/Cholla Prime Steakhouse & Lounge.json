{"text":"First visit to Cholla. My wife and I were looking for a steakhouse in Scottsdale. We were impressed by the reviews. This is a very small restaurant, seating for only about 50 people, including the bar. Full menu is served in the bar. We didn't have a reservation but lucked into seats at the bar. Brent, the bartender, was extremely kind and helpful. The wife had the Elk and upgraded her sides to the creamed corn casserole, I had the lamb. Both are farm bred in New Zealand and both were delicious. My sides were the brocolini and garlic mashed potatoes. Appetizer was the calamari, very good with a slightly sweet taste to the breading. Dessert was an apple galleta. We would gladly recommend the restaurant and very much recommend Brent as server and bartender. Dinner was very inexpensive, under $100 with drinks included. Definitely will return when we get the chance."}
{"text":"We were visiting from Los Angeles and looked for a steak house and went to Yelp for recommendations.  Cholla Prime Steakhouse got our attention, and after reading reviews on Yelp, decided to give it a try.  
Yes, it was a good experience.  The restaurant is small, and somewhat quiet, and just the right size to feel comfortable.  The waitress was wonderful!
The Caesar salad was not presented well, but tasted good. I ordered a rare steak, and it came out medium, to medium-rare.  My husband ordered medium-rare steak and his steak was closer to rare, so we switched steaks.   The restaurant gave us a free desert for the screw up, and that was nice of them.  The desert was good, the fresh berries were excellent, and the wine was excellent."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner! It's amazing how much food we got for a very reasonable price. The filet mignon was a 4 stars. Surprisingly there was no music background but the atmosphere was pleasant. The staff was kind and attentive. The creme brûlée was a hit! We will defitnely go back :-)"}
{"text":"Best dinner I've ever had in the Phoenix area! It's my new favorite restaurant and we will be back a lot! Service was great and the food was absolutely amazing! We went for my birthday and got a free prickley pear cheesecake. There was so many little surprises throughout dinner like a sample of filet mignon, lemon sorbet, tasty bread, delicious cornbread  and raspberry chocolate. We would have easily paid twice the amount for this dinner. It's a great affordable, romantic and awesome place to eat dinner!"}
{"text":"This place has awesome food and the best bartender in town! If it wasn't for Brent the bartender the lounge would not be the same! Brent is what makes the lounge the best lounge in town!"}
{"text":"This place had good food with excellent service for a reasonable price. My husband and I were on our babymoon in Arizona and wanted a nice steak dinner. I found Cholla on Yelp and was glad we had the opportunity to try it. They provided bread and cornbread along with butter and pesto butter. The pesto butter is a must try. We started with the wedge salad which was good and had a nice presentation. Between the salad and our main course, we were served lemon sorbet to cleans our palette. This was an unexpected surprise and very nice. I ordered the filet mignon and husband ordered New York steak strip. Each entree comes with two sides. The New York steak strip was delicious with lots of flavor. Since I can't have raw meat with the pregnancy, I asked for my steak to be medium plus but it turned out to be a little over cooked. Nonetheless it was good. We both asked for the sauce to be on the side so it wouldn't ruin the flavor our our steaks. Make sure you make a reservation."}
{"text":"I'm writing this from sitting in the bar so much. I have eaten here a lot lately. I always have a great experience when sitting at the bar. Great service, food, and drinks....the dining room experiences, lets just say not even up to par on there best day..."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going to Cholla for 20 years. It has always been good but recently some quality and cost saving issues have cropped up. On a recent visit I ordered the seafood bisque and I have enjoyed it for years. This last time it was the consistency of ketchup and the bowl was filled right to the brim. It was unappetizing and no longer a soup. We both ordered filets and what arrived were two end cuts. The meat was good quality but an end cut cannot be cooked the same throughout. This was obviously done to save money. This is the second time this has happened. It is inexcusable in a good steak house. If you have to raise prices to serve a correct  steak then do it. Cholla used to be famous for its baby carrots. What I received were normal carrots trimmed to look like baby carrots. The sauces served with our steaks were cold. All of this is fixable but I am afraid the cost cutting and inattention to detail is sad. The Cholla of old is now just a fond memory.

We went back several days later to try things again. After so many years of going here we were not going to give up that easy. Everything was perfect. The bisque was great, the steaks perfect and my favorite carrots were just the right size. Glad things are back together,"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. I love it so much that, for occasions special enough to warrant it, I will drive to the other side of the city, go to a casino I otherwise would never visit, and walk through a room that is more cigarette smoke than oxygen just to get in this restaurant's front door. Once I am inside? Perfection. The food is fantastic, always, and very affordable considering the quality and quantity. But my favorite part is how they treat their guests. Out of all the restaurants I visit, this is the one that always makes me feel special. Samples from the kitchen. Sorbet palate cleaners. Damp cloth towels to clean your hands. Macaroons with the check. I always leave feeling like I got a glimpse of how people richer than me live, and I can just be myself in my normal clothes to get it. 

Also, the prime steak is fantastic, and if I recall correctly, they bring you creme brulee if it's your birthday or similar special occasion. Delicious creme brulee. Yum."}
{"text":"We are always extremely satisfied with our experience when we have dinner there.  Great service, awesome food and wonderful presentation."}
{"text":"My ribeye and my wife's filet were excellent. Great prices too, we each got a drink and the bill was $60."}
{"text":"Food is very good and so is the service. The prices are great too. 
Only reason 4 stars and not 5 stars is they plated food wrong and 2 of our party had their orders mixed up on different plates."}
{"text":"Our family went to this restaurant specifically because of the Yelp review and were VERY pleasantly confirmed on our desire for a moderately priced steakhouse. There were 5 of us and we all ordered steaks of all kinds and each was impeccably seared and flavored. All the little touches of great service and special touches was great ! They brought out sample nuggets of filet mignon, specialty breads and little nuggets of lemon sorbet to start, then after the fabulous dinner brought scrumptious little nuggets of raspberry chocolate dessert, all complementary touches that were very classy. One of the best features was how quiet the restaurant was, we were able to hear each other, a lot of steakhouses are crowded and noisy making the experience more about the food and not the conversation. This was a wonderful experience !!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for our wedding anniversary on a referal from a friend.  And I have to say, it was a great choice!  I got the Lamb Chops and my husband got the Elk Tenderloin...I have never eaten such amazingly prepared food in my life!  And for the price...I may ask to go back for my birthday!"}
{"text":"After an amazing drive threw the wilderness starting in Chandler up to Payson then Christopher Creek and a back road to Young and down to Globe we decided we wanted steak. Had nothing to do with all the cows we saw along the way.  Once again I'm Yelping for beef!

This place had mostly the best reviews. So we gave it a try. Now don't get confused with Morton's you are entering a casino. I read it was \"dressy\" recommended and someone's comment that it was far from that and given we've been driving for hours with the windows down we were absolutely not dressy. I figure \"casino\".... We can go however we please. And I was right. We got there at. 4:40 and they don't open until 5:00 so we put out name in the reservation book and walked around for 20 minutes. 

They were very friendly and the bus-man was super friendly.  Linda was our waitress too and she was very welcoming. 

We both had New York strip, baked potato and asparagus. In addition we ordered creamed spinach. My only complaint was medium rare came medium. My husband did not like the basaltic onions on his steak. He thought they were over powering. I liked them. 

We had calamari. I was not thrilled with it but husband liked them. They tasted like they had cinnamon in the breading. 

The price was great and for that four stars. 

PS. Concord Road down Hwy 288. With a stop at McFadden lookout a must!"}
{"text":"This is a really a hidden jem. We had an absolutely wonderful experience. The food is some of the best I have ever had. We had steak and lobster. The creamed spinach is to die for. Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"Went there again recently.  This time, sat at the bar and watched sports while eating their steak.  It was great like the last time...   well with a SURPRISE.


The bill was HALF of what it used to be.  Apparently, the slashed their price so what I paid over $60 last time was like $25.  WHAT?

You can't go wrong here folks."}
{"text":"Wifes b day, couldn\"t have asked for a more pleasent experience. Great food, service and price. Can't wait for my b day. We will be back."}
{"text":"Steak was so good.  Ribeye, filet mignon and chateaubriand are the best anywhere in the valley.  Better than Shula steakhouse at the Wild Horse Pass Casino.  The price was also very good.  Service was very good.   Atmosphere was very good for a small restaurant."}
{"text":"I saw the good ratings and went for dinner on a business trip.  I didn't realize it was in a casino, and I hated the setting.  Had to walk through a smoke filled casino to get to a tiny restaurant, with a long line of people waiting for the buffet next door blocking the door.  The food was a great bargain!  Got lamb chops and so-so creme brulee for only $30.  They gave us a taste of the filet and sorbet the cleanse the pallet.  The lamb chops were very nice.  If you don't mind the setting, you can get a great deal here."}
{"text":"My husband took me here for our 5th Anniversary and we were speechless. Gourmet meal from start to finish! The specialty breads, sorbet, sides & chocolates were delicious additions to the chorizo stuffed dates, which were delectable, the strip, which was perfection, and the delightful creme brule with fresh berries.
This chef is world class and the service was top notch."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the best kept secrets in Scottsdale. The steaks, seafood, desserts and service was amazing!  Everything you would expect from a high end restaurant.  We will be back again soon.  Thank you for the great evening!"}
{"text":"Best place to have a wonderful meal. We drive from the other side of town at least twice a month!! The staff is amazing and always make us feel welcome!! Every person we have told about Cholla has loved it!!!"}
{"text":"Came to chollas on a business trip. The ribeye was very good and the price can't be beat at 20 bucks. The chef brought samples of other dishes and complimentary apps and dessert as well. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Hey Yall....Lord have mercy on my greedy butt!!!!! Okay 1st off this joint is located in a stinky azz casino....but when has SMOKE or LURKING BUMS ever stopped me...Ha Ha Ha...i laugh in the face of danger for good food. This place here is quite an EXPERIENCE. I can't believe that they don't have more reviews...to be honest it's sad that they don't. Well was greeted like Royalty and Promptly Seated...my server Linda was great and knowledgeable of the menu....i had Filet Mignon with Proccini Mushroom sauce, Au Gratin Potatoes, and Broccolini....NO SEASONING REQUIRED....now about the experience: while you're reviewing: the menu another server comes out with a bite size pieces of ribeye steak possibly medium rare with a . bernaise sauce, the same server Romero comes out again with a basket of bread sourdough and pepperoni bread for your spreass you have pesto and butter pluse a mini skillet of cornbread, while you're finishing up your breads they then come out with a ice lemon treat to cleanse your palate right before your main course comes out....i also tried the Creme Brulee on the manager. As I write this Linda then brings me out a Raspberry treat....send yes Hunty I have pictures of it all!!!! This is a treat that you should not miss out on."}
{"text":"I have to admit, I wondered why my son recommended a restaurant in a casino.  We were pleasantly surprised- great atmosphere, wonderful food, excellent service and quality.  The restaurant is off the casino floor, yet one could not hear the casino sounds.  My husband and I both got the filet, which was cooked perfectly and was fork-tender.  The shrimp bisque was full of seafood, could have been a meal itself.  We will definitely come back!  Note: do make a reservation, they had to turn away walk-ins."}
{"text":"Wonderful food.well prepared and a delightful Server: Elsa!  We will  definitely return!"}
{"text":"This is our go to restaurant for special dinners. We love the seafood bisque and the steak and mushroom soups.  The asparagus is perfectly grilled and yummy.  We typically get a soup each and the chateau Briand for two.  The only \"negative\" would be that they no longer have the creme brûlée which was great.  The replacement cake /creme brulee is not as good."}
{"text":"Walk in for my reservation...a lady with a small dog in her hands at the table and feeding it. I canceled my reservation right there. Dogs don't belong in restaurants. Disgusting"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, the food is amazing and the prices even better the service is outstanding.....we will become regulars..."}
{"text":"The food was OUTSTANDING!!! Our waiter Dustin was very attentive. Took the, wife out for her birthday and they remembered the note I placed when I booked the reservation. We had filet mignon, the wife,  and I had the ribeye. Both just melted in your mouth. We've eaten at Ruth Chris for her birthday in the past, and they have nothing on this place. A Lot Less Expensive Than Ruth Chris also. We will be returning in the future."}
{"text":"Everything about our experience was amazing.  We are in town for the week and selected Cholla for our wedding anniversary dinner.  We had the chateaubriand for two and we both agreed it was one of the most delicious and memorable entrees we ever had (and we are foodies).  Service was excellent and they even gave us a complimentary dessert for our anniversary.  The price was also unbelievable given the quality of the meal and service."}
{"text":"This a great place for great food. I had the Elk steak with broccoli and potatoes with a glass of red wine.  The elk was awesome!!!  A definite must the next time you are there."}
{"text":"As always one of the best dining experiences around. Great food, wonderful staff and an intimate dining setting. We always come here for our special occasions as well as a great date night. oh it is reasonably priced ;)"}
{"text":"Good - it tries to be a high end steak restaurant but it is not - the food quality is not there - but the prices are appropriate.  But the service was excellent.  So if you want a high end restaurant experience (without the prices (and you don't mind the 'not quite high end' quality)) this place is very good."}
{"text":"Service, food, prices, atmosphere.... This place has it all:)  It is fine dining at great prices and the food is amazing. My Dad and Husband had the NY strip, my daughter had shrimp and I had the lamb. They we are all so delicious, perfectly cooked and served in a very professional manner. Our water glasses were constantly full, drinks orders were updates, plates cleared, etc - and all so smoothly that we never noticed. Our waitress was the best - so polite and helpful. I can;t say enough about Cholla... get there and get eating!"}
{"text":"Honestly I don't believe I've ever had such a great meal for such a great price! Bottle of wine, appetizers, dessert plus full meal for husband & I for around $60! Absolutely amazing in all aspects."}
{"text":"Arrived without a reservation about a quarter to six. Despite there being several empty tables, we were forced by the hostess to sit at the uncomfortable bar. We finished our dinner in about an hour and a half, during which time there were always tables available in the dining room, where we wanted to sit. The food was okay, about $100 for two including tip, however they get one star for the seating arrangements. The two ladies who were tasked with seating patrons seemed rather disorganized and confused."}
{"text":"We went to 'our' special place for our anniversary.  We have been here several times and thought it was the BEST.  11.13.17 was NOT.  The hostess lied to us.  ??  We really thought we probably had visited the restaurant more than she had.  She stated that we could not have a booth.  She told us that we could not have a table other than the one she chosen for us.  Hmmm no others came in the 1.5+ hours we were there, to the other tables or booth.  We had another couple with us, but was rather disheartening to be treated this way.  We really though mgmt. had changed or something:?.  The steak was very good; service at the table was good.  It just made it a little unpleasant to be treated so rudely with the hostess.  We will try it one more time; however, it was not as spectacular as our many times prior."}
{"text":"The wait staff energy was over the top. All professional, friendly and working the room together. The food exceeded our expectations. We had the porterhouse for two & it was cooked to perfection. Enjoyed the ambiance of a smaller steakhouse. Reservations recommended."}
{"text":"What a wonderful evening.  We celebrated my husband's retirement.  Elsie was a great server along with others that gave us attention.  Compliments to the chef.  We will be back.

Brenda"}
{"text":"We dined at the Cholla Prime Steakhouse Lounge to celebrate my husband's birthday. We were greeted warmly by the hostess and shown to a spacious booth. From then on the service was excellent: drinks, warm bread with butter and pesto sauce, and a surprising amuse bouche of filet mignon. My husband had intended to order a New York strip steak but was intrigued by the Elk chops on the special anniversary menu that included two sides and a wedge salad. I ordered the lamb chops and substituted mint jelly for the spicy yogurt. The waitress offered to split the salad. After the salad we were brought scoops of raspberry sherbet as a palate cleanser. The main courses were delicious and perfectly prepared. The birthday boy was offered the dessert menu and he chose chocolate cake. It came with a candle and a chocolate birthday card.
The whole dining experience was wonderful, great food and excellent service. The prices are too good to be true. We are already planning to come back to try other items on the menu.
Thank you to everyone for making my husband's birthday memorable."}
{"text":"My family of 5 was on a vacation in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area, and relied on Yelp for every meal for a week.  On our last night, we wanted to eat a nice steak dinner at a local restaurant that we couldn't find back home in Houston.  As I searched, I came across this restaurant that had only 11 reviews, but awesome ratings.  I was a little hesitant and skeptical that the reviews may be from employees since there weren't that many, but went anyways.  It was hands down, the best meal of our stay in Arizona.  It may be our favorite steakhouse ever...and we live in Texas, so that's saying a lot.

The restaurant is located in a smelly and smoky casino, so you have to endure walking through that on your way...but just plug your nose and press on, because it's worth it!  The service from the hostess, manager, servers and chef was superb from start to finish.  They treated us as if we were royalty (as they did with the other diners as well), and we couldn't have had a better experience.  Also, I couldn't believe the low prices for such amazing quality.  Our bill was $143 for a seafood appetizer, 5 huge dinners with fresh sides and dessert.  My husband and I have spent that on a steak dinner for 2 in Houston.

They start off with a big basket of different breads, whipped butter, and delicious pesto spread...but that's not all.  Then they brought us these adorable little cast iron skillets of southwestern cornbread.  After we ordered, they brought each of us a chef's tasting of filet to wet our appetites (oh so good).  Before our main course, they brought each of us a perfect little bite of sorbet with blueberries to cleanse our palette (my daughters were wishing for more).  Then after our main course, they brought each of us this delectable little white chocolate coconut morsel to end the meal.  Oh my word...all of it was fabulous.  We ordered 4 steaks, and each cut of meat was of such high quality, and can't believe how inexpensive everything was!  Here's what we ordered...

shrimp & king crab cocktail - scrumptious...and what's more, it was $9!

2 filet mignon w/ bernaisse sauce (one with grilled shrimp, one with lobster tail) - both cooked and seasoned to absolute perfection.

grilled salmon w/ oscar style sauce & king crab meat - delicious!

NY strip steak w/ caramelized onions and balsamic glaze - oh my word...to die for!

ribeye steak w/ mushroom sauce - the sauce was wonderful, and the ribeye cooked perfectly!

My girls are making fun of me for writing this mini novel of a review, but what can I say?  We loved it, and will be returning first thing if we are ever in Phoenix again."}
{"text":"I finally made it out to Cholla Steakhouse on my last night I was in town. Spring Training had just started, most restaurants were booked but luckily Cholla had availability so I booked and had a fantastic experience. The casino itself may be a bit of an eye sore, however the restaurant is charming and really nice.  It had an upscale feel without being stuffy. The prices were great, my rib eye was only $20! This is a steal compared to most steakhouses in Scottsdale. 

The restaurant is small and quaint, nice white linen on the tables, and very attentive service.  I really appreciated all of the small details, like the yummy sorbet which was the 1st course, and oh my goodness, the chocolate truffles we received after we ate- all kinds of yummy!  My only suggestion/constructive criticism is that the tables are too close to each other. We could hear the whole conversation of the people in the table next to us. Other than that, everything was really great.  I will absolutely be returning."}
{"text":"My GF and I love Cholla. its in the middle of a casino but they did a good job with the sound insulation so you cant really tell. On top of that the food has been amazing all the times we've been there."}
{"text":"STOP READING, JUST EAT HERE!  OK, I'd be skeptical too, so here goes:

I went to this restaurant based on earlier Yelp reviews.  It seemed strange to me that a steakhouse buried in a run of the mill casino would be rated so highly but we decided to give it a shot.  We were rewarded big time.

This was the best meal I've had in years, period.  It truly felt like five-star dining, from food quality to food quantity to atmosphere to service to value.  

We ordered the porterhouse for two for $59.  It also came with clams/mussels, salad and four accompaniments.

SPOILER ALERT:  There were a few amazing touches that really made the experience.  After we ordered, we were brought a small sample of filet mignon to what our appetites.  It was absurdly tender and flavorful, and came with an unbelievable porcini mushroom sauce.  Later, there was a mango sorbet intermezze.  The coup de gras was that they actually cut the steak for us into small strips (about 1 inch by 3 inches), picking the bones almost totally clean!  Finally, even though we didn't order dessert (no room!), we were brought delicious cubes of espresso chocolate.

Oh yeah, unlike most restaurants that gouge for little things like sodas and substitutions (if they even permit them), we were charged $1! for soda with unlimited refills, and nothing for a substitution of a salad that cost $1 more.

This is that rare restaurant that truly understands customer service, and strives to provide not just a nice meal, but an \"experience\"."}
{"text":"Cholla is a regular choice for us for a nice dinner for two or to celebrate a special occassion.  The meat is always very good cuts.  We often select the château briand for two and have lobster mashed and creamed corn casserole as sides.  It's all awesome and we always take home leftovers.  As for dessert, usually were too full, but when we have partaken, it has been great.....usually split dessert if we can even think about ordering it.  Brent, the bartender, has been there for years and is a great, sincere conversationalist and an extremely knowledgeable bartender.  He pours top shelf booze as the well!  Forexample, well vodka is, I believe, Kettle One, and whiskey/bourbon is Jack Daniels.  Never used to need reservations, but now very popular...but you can make reservations online for small tables.  Still have to call the restaurant for reservations of 5+ in my experience.  Go!!  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner at the Cholla.  We were worried might smell like smoke but not at all.
The food and service were wonderful - and very reasonable.
The only suggestion, not really a criticism, is that their creamed spinach was not really
\"creamed\", more like sautéed with cream in it, could give them some pointers!!"}
{"text":"Late Post: We held our wedding celebration on November 2015 here at Cholla. The attention to detail and the impeccable service the staff at Cholla provided our party of 14 was amazing! We cannot commend them enough! They made our day more special than we could have imagined! Our guests love Cholla and they still talk about it til this day! The Chateaubriand is to die for and the lobster mashed potatoes were everyone's favorite side dish! Everything was amazing from the appetizers to the desserts! We want to send a special Thank You to Joy and the waitstaff that night! They are amazing! Joy made the reservations, concerns, and the whole night run smoothly. One of our greatest memories were made here! We will be back every year!"}
{"text":"I love cholla! I come here for special occasions and it never disappoints! If you're looking for a delicious dinner with a quiet intimate space this is the perfect place. They always cook my steak how I like. I will continue to come here and highly recommend it."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise to have such a great dining experience at such a reasonable price.  The steaks were great but it was the great service and all of the added extra touches.......sorbet, macaroons that made it a dining experience to remember,"}
{"text":"This place was amazing!!! Great service and food!! Loved it!! My husband had Elk chops which were so tender. The environment was also amazing!!"}
{"text":"Line for the buffet was too long so we went to cholla. Service was excellent even though it was our waiters second day. We received an amuse bouche of tenderloin with two sauces which was delicious. Drinks refilled promptly, the manager stopped by often to check on us. Will definitely be back as the food was excellent! 7-13-16."}
{"text":"The service was good the elk was great but I took my Mother here for her birthday and they didn't acknowledge it so I should of given 4 stars but the food was great."}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant. Yes, restaurant inside of a Casino. The food was amazing, the service stupendous from David. I hope it doesn't get too busy in the future but I do wish them more than enough customers. I loved the complementary sample of filet mignon, sorbet, and truffle chocolate lollipop. They were amazing and even better was the price for the meal. Such an amazing deal."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to celebrate my granddaughter's belated birthday dinner and the rave reviews for CHOLLA made the decision for us.  When we arrived, we were graciously greeted.  The place is intimate and lovely.  I particularly liked their large semi-circular booths and the colorful, contemporary paintings.  Really eye-popping art that is truly pleasing.  

We had reservations for 7PM but they were not ready for us so we waited by the bar/lounge.  It wasn't long until they called us to our booth. Yes, a booth.  I love a booth!   Once we ordered, they brought us an \"amuse-bouche\" composed of a cube of beef with blue cheese/bacon topping.  Very delicious-- a virtual party in our mouths.  We were also served a basket of breads including a salami bread, cranberry bread, pumpernickel, and a small cornbread topped with bacon which was presented in its own mini-skillet. These were accompanied by a absolutely delicious pesto and swirled butter.  For an appetizer, we ordered the cheese plate which came with several  cheeses,  a spicy salami, candied walnuts, grapes, and a variety of olives--an appetizer that pleased everyone.  
We were served a palate cleanser of lemon sorbet before our entrees arrived.  Nice touch.  The mains were the Lamb chops served with a baked potato and broccolini and the filet mignon with potatoes au gratin and grilled asparagus. The filet mignon was cooked to perfection and the au gratin was so cheesy it was like eating your favorite version of mac and cheese. The lamb was also perfectly cooked and was a very ample portion.  I had the shrimp BLT which consisted of two mini buns with 2 shrimp each with lettuce/tomatoes and bacon, with a large serving of waffle fries.  I didn't want to eat all that bread so I ate the shrimp (which were perfectly grilled) with the lettuce and tomato as a wrap.  For those of you who don't want too much bread, you may want to avoid this dish.  The waffle fries were really crispy and delicious.  
The birthday girl got a huge slice of chocolate cake and Sami our server accompanied us in singing Happy Birthday to our precious granddaughter.  The sweet granddaughter, however, refused to share one bite of that humongous piece of cake.  She reported that it was absolutely amazing.  The chocolate mousse we ordered was good, but average tasting. 
 
All in all our first impression of Cholla in terms of food and service is 5 star all the way.  The management is polite, yet friendly and Sami, our server did a wonderful job of pacing our meal and taking care of our needs.  There definitely will be a return visit."}
{"text":"Keith, Brent and Staff rocked it again last night!! 8 oz Prime rib, cooked to perfection! Such an awesome place. : )"}
{"text":"Just returned from a wonderful steak supper at the Cholla.
Service impeccable, great atmosphere.
One of the best steak suppers we have ever had, the strip steak.and fillet cooked to perfection.
All employees handled their jobs with pride and perfection.
Do not hesitate to try this place."}
{"text":"So this place is a deal if you are looking for really great prices and I wanted to love it - but the longer I was there, the less I wanted to come back.  This is an american restaurant that happens to serve steak made by a cook - not a true steakhouse.

I showed up on a busy night without a resv and they were very nice about squeezing me in to a little corner table.  I wasn't sure if my table was even assigned to my waiter but that maybe he was doing it as a favor.  I started with mushroom steak soup and the portion was substantial and delicious.  The start and the finish were super promising for this meal with a creme-brulee with a ton of berries on top.  It didn't even bother me that there was a dusty and mushy strawberry included because i just took it off and the remainder of the berries was still plentiful.

For my main course I ordered the ribeye - which showed up on my table with giant crab legs - which i didn't order and can't eat due to a stupid allergy.  Sometime later, my steak showed up with a mushroom sauce, brocolini and potatoes au gratin.  The mushroom sauce was very similar to the soup (i wonder if it was the same base).  The steak was filled with connective tissue and tough veins.  I worked hard to cut around the worst parts and I felt bad trying to deftly take a few of the chewiest pieces out of my mouth without being obvious. I probably ate 60 percent of the steak but that was large enough for any guy. The brocolini was fresh but had little flavor - i usually love that side.  The potatoes tasted great with a ton of cheese but they were undercooked even though they were sliced super thin.  Like the steak, the potatoes were a very healthy portion.  If they had been completely cooked - it would have been great.

My waiter was very nice and super pleasant, just not all that attentive.  When I started dinner, the place was slammed but after about 30 mins it slowed down to half capacity.  The fewer people I saw in the restaurant, the less I saw of my waiter strangely enough.  My iced tea didn't get filled once during my main course and I had to ask for the house bread that i heard other patron's making a big deal about.  I really did enjoy two of the three breads, I just wish I had received it sooner.  And when I was finished with a plate or dish, it wouldn't get taken off my table.  I even tried placing on the edge of the far side of the table - but that didn't seem to have an effect."}
{"text":"We came here for my birthday.  It was good treat by my honey bunny.  I will start off and say this place is really small and cozy.  I love that.  The service was really good too.  I ordered the bacon wrapped filet with a potato.  They offer a sauce for the filet too.  I asked for it on the side.  The filet was good and did not need any sauce.  It was cooked to perfection also.  The bacon was crispy too.  The potato was baked and really good also.  The cake desert they served was also really good too.  These types of steak meals remind me of my childhood out hunting, fishing and or varmint control.  Grilling a good cut of meat with a baked potato was the best."}
{"text":"Went to Cholla for my birthday dinner based on the reviews on yelp. Food, service and facility was great. The price for all of the dining amenities was very reasonable. Would have rated 5 stars but the ambiance was a little too \"casino-ey\". Many of the patrons were loud and a bit obnoxious for this quality restaurant. Additionally, the entrance was congested with the buffet  crowd waiting in line for the casino buffet. Bottom line is that the meal and service was great. They even brought me a very nice birthday piece of cake with a candle. Recommend this place just be pre-warned that it is in a casino."}
{"text":"We had a great time at this establishment.  The service was exceptional right when we entered the casino.  We sat at the bar and were served by a 15 year veteran.  She is a great representative of this organization and really believes in her product and her company.  We also witnessed other employees enjoying the food and service of this great establishment.  I was impressed how the management takes great care of their people here. 
The prices are very reasonable.  I wish to return here soon.

{"text":"Upon immediate arrival, we was greeted with courtesy among the beautiful and quant atmosphere of the restaurant. The prices are more than fair. The ribeye and their sauce is amazing, the American sirloin burgers was great, and the lobster mashed potatoes was special. Portions was more than enough, waitress was pleasant, the care was consistent, there was nothing to complain about. 10/10 would come again, topped off with a casino on the side."}
{"text":"I can't say enough wonderful things about the food quality at this restaurant for the price!  I've had dinner there three times  this week and the filet is simply amazing.  I had my first sample of Cholla Steakhouse 12 years ago and although I don't gamble, I will keep coming back again and again for the filet.  I think I know what dinner is going to be tonight :)"}
{"text":"Outstanding service from Roger greeting us to Elsie waiting on us.  Staff was completely professional.  Our meals were made to perfection.  We had appetizers, salads, steaks and deserts all with incredible favor.  Hats off to the chef's skills.  Excellent value!"}
{"text":"I hate writing a negative review for a place that I've raved about for years, but tonight's entree was so very subpar that I feel I need to.  I've eaten here at least 20 times and have never ever ever been disappointed until tonight.  I was in a hurry to catch a concert or I would've complained and sent it back.  First of all the bread, and shrimp cocktail was great as always.  Service was fine!  The Lobster tail, Ribeye Steak, Broccolini and Au gratin potatoes were really bad tonight.  You can tell in the pic how undercooked and lifeless my Lobster tail was, tasted gummy and horrible.  The Ribeye was flavorless and nowhere close to medium rare.  Potatoes were flavorless and undercooked and the broccolini just had zero flavor.  I had the steak boxed up as I think I can season it at home and throw it on my grill at home tomorrow for lunch and at least salvage it in some capacity.  Not sure if there's new mgt or new cooks in the kitchen or a combo of both.  Again just not what I've been accustomed to dining here for several years!  And Yes I have a pretty upset stomach as I'm writing this, go figure"}
{"text":"What a fantastic find! For more of an upscale restaurant the food was very reasonably priced (my filet was almost the same price as at Outback) and everything was cooked to perfection! Nice atmosphere and great service, but it was the extra little touches like the warm towel and sorbet that really put it over the top. It is a very small restaurant (there are only maybe 15 tables) though so definitely make a reservation."}
{"text":"I have been to casino Arizona dozens of times and tonight was by far the worst. The group that I was with started at the high roller table. When we walked away with a winning, we decided to have a nice dinner at Cholla. A couple of the friends with us told myself and my boyfriend that this was the place to go. After arriving at 4:30 (tried to keep it an early evening) we were told that the restaurant was not open yet. We asked if we could hang out at the bar for a half hour prior to the restaurant opening.  The hostess said yes and my group proceeded to have a couple drinks and shots. When we were escorted to our table for dinner, we were told that one of the guests could not order a cocktail or he would be thrown out.  One girl even ordered a martini and got a margarita. The service was terrible!!  After appetizers (which were horrible) we tried to order more cocktails and were denied. After being escorted out of the restaurant for trying to order cocktails (beer really), we were forced to leave the casino as a whole. There was security waiting for us the the entrance of the restaurant. Long story short, if you want to come for a nice dinner and gamble, don't plan on drinking."}
{"text":"We visited Cholla Prime Steakhouse and Lounge to celebrate our anniversary.  We had originally planned to go on Friday the actual date of our anniversary, but had to reschedule to Sunday.  I have to say without a doubt:  It was one of the finest dining experiences that we have ever had.  The ambiance of the restaurant, the attentiveness of the staff, not to mention that the food was SUPERB.  FINEST steak dinner I have ever experienced.  Definitely will return and have already recommended to several co-workers."}
{"text":"Dinner last night was incredible! And so reasonably priced.

We started off with a small piece of filet and artichoke, compliments of the chef. There was a white sauce with a hint of horseradish on top and the meat was delicious. Then the bread was brought out. It came with whipped butter and a pesto dip which was so yummy. There was several different breads: a pepperoni roll, a wheat, and a slice with what I think were sundried tomatoes. The pepperoni roll was incredible and I am not normally a fan of pepperoni...

For appetizers we ordered the bacon-wrapped dates ($8) and the calamari ($7). The calamari was nice and crispy and the lemon pepper tartar sauce had a little kick to it. However, the clear winner of this round was the dates. They are stuffed with chorizo and a water chestnut, then wrapped in bacon and served with an amazing hoisin dipping sauce. The water chestnut added just the right amount of crunch and the dipping sauce was fantastic. These are a must-order!

Next, the bowl of seafood bisque ($7) I ordered came out. The manager warned me that it was a big bowl of soup but the size still surprised me! It was probably the best seafood bisque I have ever tasted, loaded with chunks of shrimp, scallop and crab that I could actually identify, unlike some that I have ordered in the past. At only $7 it's a steal! I had to box at least half of it up t leave room for my entree.

Next came a mini martini glass with a small scoop of orange sherbet to cleanse our palettes. I am normally more of an ice cream fan, but this was some of the best sherbet ever! I found myself wishing the scoop was just a little big bigger :)

The entrees were brought next. I ordered the filet with prawns ($26) and my friend got the lamb ($22). My filet was cooked perfectly rare and the bearnaise on top was to die for. The prawns sat on some tomato lime coulis which was great. My friend let  me try a piece of lamb and it too was cooked perfectly to medium rare. It had just the right amount of fat in the cut of meat. Our sides included broccolini (also cooked perfectly), au gratin potatoes (yummy), creamed spinach (not as creamy as I am used to but the crunchy topping really elevated it), and lobster mashed potatoes (with chunks of delicious lobster in nearly every bite, $7 upcharge). 

At this point I was too stuffed to eat anymore, but my friend ordered the dessert special, a baklava cheesecake ($7). The round cheesecake had the sweet honey glaze on it and crunchy filo and nuts piled on top. I only managed one bite but the contrast of the cheesecake with the crunchy filo was amazing!

Finally, we were brought two small chocolate espresso cubes to finish up. I ate a bit of one and it was creamy and delicious. 

All the food we were served was soo delicious and the best part was the price: Just over $100 WITH TIP.  I mean, we basically had an eight course meal for two people, so that is an incredible deal. Plus I was so impressed with the quality of the food. The filet was one of the best I have ever had, the seafood bisque was absolutely loaded with seafood, and I will dream about those dates until I can go back. This is a great gem of a restaurant."}
{"text":"Great place to have a date night without emptying your wallet. Best of all, the food is great and the service is always top notch. Only thing that kinda sucks is you have to go through a smiley casino to get to it. 

FYI, make sure you have a reservation. Food will not disappoint."}
{"text":"We were visiting from Seattle and decided to go to this steakhouse based on the Yelp reviews, and it did not disappoint! The service, the food, and the wine were outstanding. The staff was such a pleasure to interact with and they were very attentive to our every need. I highly recommend this steakhouse."}
{"text":"Wow thank you Yelp.
Shrimp and crabmeat cocktail 5 Yelp
Calamari 4 Yelp
Ribeye steak 5 Yelp
Service 5 Yelp
Beef tenderloin sample, sorbet before entrees and pistachio crusted truffle dessert are complimentary.
Great value.
Better than most steakhouses and Vegas high end restaurants."}
{"text":"I have been taking family and friends here for 8 years, never a bad experience I'm a foodie, the foo d amazing annd wonderful service, miss my f av server who l left 4 years ago due to GF + new baby...even h ad my daughter's ASU graduation family dinner here last year  her choice! AMAZING"}
{"text":"Place is small.  Very smoky walk through casino to get to restaurant.  Great old school service.  Great breads, pepperoni bread, bacon corn bread.  Chef tasting of filet mignon and lobster bite was delicious.  Ordered chateau briande for 2.  Delicious.  Solid sides with creamed spinach.  Great pricing.   Complimentary dessert bites.  Sorbet to cleanse your palate between courses.  Will be back"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! The food is always fresh and perfectly cooked. The wait staff are always kind and courteous. I recommend this place to anyone! This place should be a 4-5 star restaurant. Some people will disagree with me on my next comment but I believe they are hands down the best steak restaurant in Arizona and that includes being better than Ruth Chris. They never fail to amaze me any time we go. Two thumbs up"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! Had the seafood bisque and it is just perfect! My party had burgers and loved them! No one spoke as everyone was too busy eating, just absolutely delicious. 
The restaurant seems to be a little small, but they definitely make the most out of their space.  The artwork isn't too much and there's a nice view of the chefs in the kitchen. Definitely a great, intimate setting!"}
{"text":"How is it that I didn't even know this place was here?? Has got to be a well kept secret lol! 

Had dinner here Monday night for the first time and this place delivers on the great reviews it has received for sure! 

We actually just ate at the bar, by choice as it wasn't packed on Monday. Ordered an appetizer of shrimp and crab cocktail and the Chateaubriand steak for 2. 

Everything came out perfectly and we enjoyed the company of our bartender, Cori very much. 

Staff was knowledgeable about the menu which made ordering very easy! 

We will be back here again soon!"}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday dinner after reading the reviews and it most definitely lived up to the hype! Service was amazing, the prices were amazing and the food was to die for! My husband and I both ordered the filet mignon and both were cooked perfected. We had the creme brûlée also and It was the best I've ever had! I could rave on and on about this place but I think you get the point!"}
{"text":"love this place I recommend it to everyone. the food is delicious can't wait to go back. great surprise for my fiancé on Valentine's Day"}
{"text":"This was the first time we dined at Cholla customer service here was superb and on key.  They really know how to make you feel special.  When we looked at the menu we were so surprised on how inexpensive everything was.  Our bill ended up be about $65 plus tip.  We started off with the Chorizo Stuffed Dates..they were very tasty.  We then split the Cranberry Spinach Salad which was awesome, the candied cashews is a great addition to the salad.  Our main entree was the Chateaubriand for two.  It is a 16oz prime filet, it melted in our mouths!  The lobster mashed potatoes were also incredible!  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"The best steakhouse I've ever been to.  Service excellent, food quality excellent, and all for an unbelievable price.  If you live in the Valley you really need to try this gem."}
{"text":"Definitely the goto for us. We have been regulars since moving to PHX 1year ago. If you are in the mood for a great meal and great service  at a phenomenal price. Hands down the best deal on fine dining in the city. Brent behind the bar  and  Red at the hostess desk always go the extra mile to please.  You will not be disappointed!!  Recommend making reservation in advance."}
{"text":"Huge portions, wonderful and attentive service. They really went above and beyond to make our night special. I look forward to my next celebration there!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!! Best service! Not often do you have a dining that blows you away....Cholla did this and exceeded any expectations we had. You will not find a better steak for the price anywhere in Arizona. (Yes maestros but it's 2 1/2 times the price ). They serve you a hot towel and  amuse bouche to start, sorbet in between to cleanse the palate and a 14oz ribeye with 2 sides for $20. Linda did an amazing job and we can't wait to spread the word. Thank you!"}
{"text":"We actually stood up from the table and clapped for the chefs!  Literally the food is unbelievable and walking through the floor of the casino getting to it we didn't expect a 10th of the spectacular meal we had.  With hand cleaning clothes and palette cleaning sorbet this was complete class and a full dinner for three, including apps,steaks and dessert only came to $97.  I was floored and to applaud the chef again.  Don't let the smokey casino stop you from hitting this little hidden treasure. Honestly."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp and extremely happy about it. The restaurant is located inside a casino, and it's definitely not one of the fancier casinos but don't get scared away!

Everything was amazing from the service, to ambiance, and especially the food. We started with the caesar salad which was good. For dinner we had the new york steak and filet mignon. Sides: Creamed spinach and mashed potatoes. Everything was DELiCIOUS!

If ever I'm in the Phoenix area again, I will definitely be having diiner here again!"}
{"text":"Outstanding steaks, very tasty sides, incredible service and the prices were more than reasonable!  I rate our experience at 100% All four of us agree this is the best dinner we have ever had! I highly recommend it....we will be back!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful find. The food was great and the price very reasonable for what it was. Four people with bottle of wine and dessert and coffee $147. The ambiance was elegant but not overbearing. Our waiter, Santiago, was very friendly and helpful. All in all a very nice experience."}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night. We were slightly hesitant since we usually go to the more popular steakhouses in the valley. Completely blown away!! The steaks were cooked perfectly and amazing flavor. The sides and appetizers were generous and delicious. The staff was extremely attentive and made the experience wonderful. This will definitely be a regular spot for us!"}
{"text":"Not sure what we enjoyed more, the food or the service!  Linda and Joy made my wife's birthday extremely special (besides making me look like a sweet genius for making the reservation).  The Chateaubriand was so tender I'm not sure a steak knife was needed.  And the Lobster mashed potatoes are a MUST.  Such a great experience - you can see why it's earned a 5 STAR RATING."}
{"text":"We don't go out for steak very often because we are invariably disappointed. Nice surprise at Cholla, great steaks and excellent staff. No big deal walking through the crappy casino. Prices were more than reasonable, especially if you are a wine drinker."}
{"text":"How could I not give 5 stars when I get served a piping hot bloody and well seasoned ribeye over garlic mashed with broccolini, all for $20.  First they start with chewy artisan bread with butter and an amazing pesto dip.  Then they finished me with 2 tiny but delicious macaroons that were cold and yummy.  No way you say, can't be right?  I have paid Ruth Chris, Peter Lugar outrageous sums for their steak that's triple this, and I am coming back here for more.  Chollo's is nicely tucked in Casino Arizona, its quiet with just the right sound level of jazz music, service 5 star with the bartender knowing his menu well.  This has got to be a secret, and one of Scottsdale & Phoenix besr steakhouse!  I salute you."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for our first anniversay. Absolutely fantastic and you can't beat the price! I paid $14 for the charbroiled chicken and it was unbelievably moist and tender. Topped off with shiitake mushroom sauce and parmesan mash potatoes! Yum-my! My husband had the filet mignon with mushroom sauce. They first brought out a little sample of it on a small bed of lettuce with demi glaze on it and WOW! It was crispy on the ends and cooked medium. Delicious! I'm definitely getting that next time or maybe the elk tenderloin! Mmmm! We had David as our server and he was top notch. He picked a nice wine for me to pair with my dinner and it was also heavenly with the chocolate truffles. Hope to get back here soon to try out more on the menu."}
{"text":"Great steaks, unbelievably reasonable prices, small comfortable room, just great all the way!!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and service. Not what I expected being inside a casino and very happy we went."}
{"text":"My aunt raved about this place forever and finally took us there.  After all her hype, this place did not disappoint!  It is a fancy quality steakhouse with Texas Roadhouse pricing!  I ordered the ribeye and it was one tender and ultra well seasoned piece of steak!  The au gratin potatoes were fabulous and broccolini is always a plus.  

Pros:
- classy and beautiful ambiance 
- staff was wonderful and great to our baby (we felt bad bringing her to a fancy place from the start but they were accommodating and loved her)
- the bread selection before dinner is amazing. Of note are the pepperoni bread and the bacon corn bread in a mini cast iron skillet!
- between meals they gave us mini sorbets as palate cleansers. Like I said, royal treatment for affordable price.
- complimentary macarons after dinner!

Cons:
- it is inside the Casino Arizona so you have to trek through the thick layer of smoke to get to the restaurant.
- reservations fill up fast so difficult to get in on weekends
- chocolate cake had very hard and therefore difficult to eat frosting. Only food complaint but it's forgive-able.  

Overall, amazing experience and taste for the price."}
{"text":"I have no complaints about anything here except that I almost ate too much of the awesome bread before the real food arrived. The chateaubriand was cooked perfectly and the sides were very adequately portioned. In fact, there was too large a portion of the garlic mashed potatoes for me to finish. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is my 100th review and I was wanting to save it for an extra special place....so here it is and below I'll reveal why I love this gem of a place. 

We came here for the 1st time for our 9th anniversary and it did not disappoint. We had never been here before so I called in to make a reservation. They were pretty booked a few weeks out BUT worked with me since it was for a very special occasion (at this point I am already pretty impressed). We got an early reservation, which turned out to work perfectly for our night. 

The restaurant was located inside of the casino. The ONLY downside is that it is a little smoky on the way there but there was NO SMOKE at all in the restaurant. It was very classy and modern inside with some ol'school twists in decor like the Mad Men style (mid-century mod) booths and tables that were impeccably clean and all done up by someone with my type of OCD tendencies...everything in the same spot, all the hems were even all the ironing was the perfect. We got there a little early and they opened the restaurant and offered us a seat at their bar. 

The bar tender was knowledgeable and friendly. He followed our lead and conversed with us. He had quite the selection of rum and whiskey, so my hubby was happy. The drinks were served beautifully. They also carried our drinks over once our table was ready. 

There were several people waiting on us, some one for drinks, our server, some one clearing the table, yet we NEVER felt like our conversation was interrupted. They were all very observant. 

Our dinner came with breads made on the premises, one was like a stromboli, a beautiful cornbread with fresh kernals and bacon served in a cast iron skillet and various other options with butter and a pesto butter i swear was made in heaven (it was whipped and I like how that consistency melts in your mouth). We also ordered a fruit, meat and cheese board that was served with about a lb of candied walnuts. This was basically enough for a meal so we asked to take the remainder home to enjoy over some wine. 

They serve an amuse bouche here of fillet with a beautifully savory demi glace...Bravo chef! It was delish. I definitly ordered steak. We then recieved a raspberry sorbet to cleanse our pallet and warm towels to get ready for our main course. 

I asked for the ribeye med rare with asparagus and brocolini...AMAZING. well seasoned and cooked exactly as I asked for it. The portion was generous and I ate the whole thing because I could not stop myself. The presentation was gorgeous and made me excited to try it. My husband got the special of Elk ribs cooked rare with a very savory and slightly sweet chambord sauce. WOW, it was amazing. Elk is quite lean (hence ordering it fairly rare) and they executed the order to perfection. It was succulent, well seasoned, perfectly cooked (bone in so it was beautiful) and the sauce was a nice complement to the game without being overbearing or masking the harmony of flavors. 

We were then surprised with dessert on the house for our anniversary. I am not a dessert person so my hubby picked the old fashioned chocolate cake. It has maybe 15 layers alternating cake with ganache. It included a chocolate plaque wishing us a Happy Anniversary. I had a tiny bite of this heavenly dessert....it was ice cold and served with cold forks (purposely close no doubt) and the minute it made contact with my mouth it melted into a chocolaty pool of rich chocolate flavors and textures. I was a pastry chef, this was amazing cake.  I don't like eating desserts out and would come here for coffee and cake-- for anyone that knows me well, this speaks volumes. 

They were kind and wished us an amazing night. Well, they helped to make it amazing. I cannot wait to return and try new dishes.  This will be our new spot for special occasions."}
{"text":"Outstanding from the second you walk in!  The service was wonderful, the atmosphere, food and the  prices AMAZING!  we were treated like royalty. steak dinners and sides, and more sides and more special little treats...  wonderful!

We even received a complimentary happy anniversary creme brule and the end of the night!  most amazing experience! will definitely return when in the Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"Quiet and comfortable upscale feeling restaurant located in the Casino Arizona.  Pinky towels, samples served from the chef and nightly specials.

Enjoyed a nice evening meal with friends last night.  Started with cocktails (2 @8.34) Blackened Sirloin with two sides and a Caesar Salad for 29.00.  Sirloin was medium rare after asking for \"rare\".  A bit too spicy for me and I like spicy.  Sides were fine: Baked Potato and asparagus.  My mate ordered the salmon, a Caesar Salad and had no complaints. Hers 25.00. Total bill was 78.45 including a cup of coffee for me after dinner.  (tip15.00) Total 93.45

Prices on menu seemed reasonable.  The Casino was half full on a Sunday night at 5:30-6 and the restaurant had a total of 5 tables while we were there.

Not planning on returning, but not bad if you are already there gambling and want a decent dinner.  I'd just like to add that anyplace that has \"Steakhouse\" in their title should really specialize in above average cuts of beef.  I couldn't attest to that. Our other couple with us had the Chateaubriand for Two.  Looked fine.  They had been there before."}
{"text":"Cholla is amazing! My husband and I have been here a few times now, and we have never been disappointed. Their staff is always very attentive and friendly, and the food is delicious. We will absolutely be returning!"}
{"text":"Had to update as it's been a few years & since my first review I've been here at least 15 times. Every single time we're blown away at how amazing the food & ambiance is. We always bring our out of town visitors here & they can't get over the food either. We've been to steakhouses all over the valley & none compare (ESPECIALLY in price!) Where else can you get a full steak meal that is 5 star quality for $22?! I also love that I can usually always get a reservation even if last minute. Love this place so much."}
{"text":"Still the best bartender ever - get Brent to make you a caramel appletini - you'll thank me later. 

We like to sit at the bar when we eat here - but the dining room is also quite cozy. Last time we both had the filet / grilled shrimp entrees with bearnaise sauce, mashed potatoes and we shared the creamed spinach. Everything was wonderful. It's also a great deal - not shocking as they'll get your $$$ in the casino, right? 

Definitely recommend. Suggest making a reservation as they're typically pretty booked on weekend evenings."}
{"text":"What an amazing place. All staff was very kind and very helpful. The food was the best château Briand was out of this world. I definitely will be going back. Thank you for helping us celebrate our 31st wedding anniversary. You made it very special. Thank you"}
{"text":"This is the place! Anytime we come to Spring training we hit Cholla's multiple times. I would eat here ever night if my wife would let me. Ordered the porterhouse and one of the best I've ever had. 32 oz and was meant for 2. Nope!!! All mine. Loved it so much, did it again the next night. The meat sweats were worth it! Service is outstanding as well."}
{"text":"We had a business dinner on Monday night. The place is super cute and relaxing. The dining call is connected to the cooking area so you can actually see chef. We ordered of $39 prix-fixe menu and were pleasantly surprised with the amount and quality. The food was excellent even it took a little bit longer to come out, but again 16 people ordered steak so... my coworkers were pleased with service as well. We definitely will be back next year."}
{"text":"We used to dine here frequently but the food was not to our liking. A friend suggested we return and did so this evening. What a huge difference. The food was excellent. The service was perfect. There was not one bad meal. Our party of six are looking forward to returning shortly. A gem in the valley."}
{"text":"Review is based on burger only. From the description on the menu it sounded amazing.  I figured it would be a fresh ground burger since after all Cholla is a steak house. Order burger only to be presented with a Frozen Pre made starfish shaped patty with factory grill marks! Truly disgusting burger couldn't finish half of it due to rubber like texture and lack of seasoning.  Should have returned to kitchen and had it taken off bill. I definitely would never recommend this place for a burger. Waffle fries were good just avoid burger at all cost.  All other food at Cholla is very good overall Amazing steaks. Not sure if all burgers from Cholla are always pre frozen or if I was just the unlucky one that night? Haven't been back since"}
{"text":"My husband and I dined her for NYE.  The restaurant was very clean and updated.  The food was good (for the price).  We both got the filet with shrimp and thought the steak was a bit salty.  But overall, we enjoyed our food.  You don't get 5 star food here since the prices are not as high as normal 5 star steakhouses (i.e. Mastro's).

The reason for 3 stars is for the bad service we received.  The restaurant was not busy when we dined (7:30pm).  We had Santiago as our server.  He was not mean, but not friendly either.  He made no recommendations to the menu even after we told him it was our first time here.  He never checked on us.  We had to flag him down each time we wanted to order.  Terrible service for such a special night.

Even with the reasonable prices of this restaurant, we will not return."}
{"text":"Shut the front door are you kidding me....  What a gem I was so surprised.  I have seen this place on Yelp before not sure why I didn't try it.  A co worker was in town and he was try to fine a reasonable steak house \"Bulls Eye\".

The surrounding casino is small and compared to most I've been in here in Arizona not bad.

The space it's self is small / cozy i think only 16 or so tables. From the time you were greeted until the final note I felt I was in a high end steak house. 

I won't repeat all the great things from the little taste of steak, great bread and just great service, I'll focus on the items I thought were top rate.

Think of this place as a outlet steak house, same great food at a high discount.  The New York Strip with 2 sides included for $21 would have been easily twice that even in a mid range place, plus they would have charged for the sides !!!

The thing that really impress was the wine price.  I ordered a BV blend for 45.00, and when the waiter brought out a BV Tapestry I told him that had to be the wrong one.  We'll he doubled check and it was the replacement for the one on the current list, my comment \"Sold\".  In any store retail is around what they were charging in the restaurant, so whole sale price still a very small margin for one of my favorite wines.

All in all a diamond in the rough, high quality low price incredible service, and attention to detail.  You have to try this place you will not be disappointed.."}
{"text":"We dined here in 2011 after a long day at The Grand Canyon and I remembered how great our dinner was. We came back for the second time and it was just as good as we remembered. She had the special, a blackened ribeye with the wedge salad, mashed potatoes and asparagus. I had the New York Strip with baked potato. Both were cooked to perfection. We also had the chocolate mousse for dessert. Overall a great dining experience."}
{"text":"While this is not quite experience that the name might suggest (\"Prime Steakhouse\" brings to mind Mastro's, Durant's, etc.), it is a great value and a solid place to grab a good steak.

Ambience is semi-upscale, bright (for a steakhouse), and relaxed - fits nicely in the locals casino and is a good escape from the noise, smoke, lights, etc.

Service is solid and friendly.

Drinks are reasonably priced and done like any nicer casino bar.  I had a competently made Old Fashioned (something surprisingly difficult to come by), and my wife, a sapphire & tonic - both generously poured.

They started us with an amuse bouche of filet w/ Bearnaise and micro-greens.  Cute, simple, and tasty.

We both started with the cranberry spinach salad.  They were presented nicely, but like their bread varieties, it was a heavy-handed.  The flavor was quite nice, but the salad was badly over-dressed.

Both of us also ordered filets for the main course.  I had mine with \"prawns\" (clearly your average shrimp).  Temperatures were both missed on the high-side.  I asked for med-rare and got med plus.  My wife ordered med and there was little if any pink to be found in her steak.  However, the filets were tender and seasoned perfectly.   Bearnaise and mushroom sauces were done really nicely.   Sides were solid.  Broccolini, braised carrots, garlic mashed, and au gratin.

Altogether, we got out the door (tax and 22% tip) for just about a hundred bucks - a great price for this kinda meal.

There are little high-end hints throughout (ex. palate cleanser between courses, amuse bouche, finger towels, etc.), but the overall experience is more akin to Black Angus (both in terms of price and execution) and the like - but with a definitely a notch up on the steaks.  It's a great deal and worth a visit if you want a better-than-chain steak, but don't wanna shell out for Mastro's or Capital Grille."}
{"text":"Just came home from Cholla. Reminds me very much of the old Drinkwater's in downtown Scottsdale at a quarter of the price. The food was exquisite and the service outstanding. We've decided, despite the 45 minute drive from Cave Creek, Cholla will be our 'go to' date night restaurant. PS: Anyone else as impressed as I am by how CLEAN the casino?"}
{"text":"Well worth it!!!  My new favorite steak house. It was a very good ecperience. Calling ahead for reservations is a"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful time! Took a group of 8 of us out to celebrate my birthday!! Small restaurant tucked in the back of the casino. Arrived and were seated promptly, our table was ready and waiting for us. Make a reservation! It's a small place, and you don't want to miss this opportunity!

We ordered and the yummy parade began! Got our drinks, which were constantly refilled. Next received a warm hand towel to wash our hands, then a small taste of the filet-to whet our appetites. The bread was warm and delicious, and the pesto sauce was yummy! The little cornbread skillet was also tasty.

Enjoyed my salad next-the steak one. This could have been my meal! So good, and big too! My husband got the crab stuffed prawns which he wouldn't share ;)-so that tells you how good that was!

Then we got a delicious lemon sorbet to cleanse our palettes.

By the time my ribeye arrived (which was enormous, btw!) I was nearly full!! It was tasty smothered in a yummy mushroom sauce, but I couldn't finish it. The baked potato and brocolli were also good. Husband's new your strip was also fabulous-and a more reasonable 12oz size. My friends filet was about 6oz and would have been plenty for me. Everyone raved about their steaks and sides.

They finished off my meal with a complimentary crime brûlée with candle. Very yummy and kind of them! The check came with a raspberry truffle that received mixed reviews from our group. The bill was very reasonable for the quality, flavor, service and experience we all enjoyed. 

Thank you! Can't wait to come back again soon!"}
{"text":"Overall this place was phenomenal. The service was great. They were all very nice and attentive. I even received a courtesy reminder for the reservation. There is only 15 tables or so, making a reservation is recommended. I came here with my family, 5 of us total. We all ordered the Full House. It is the filet mignon with shrimp and your choice of two sides. We all ordered our filet mignon medium and only one of them came out medium. The other 4 were medium rare. That was the only issue we had with our entire experience. The 4 of us that were served medium rare filets have eaten them that way before so we didn't make a big deal out of it. The sides we ordered were garlic mash potatoes, lobster mash potatoes, asparagus, and a baked potato. The lobster mash potatoes were amazing. The rest of the sides were very good. The other thing that we found incredible was the price. The full house was $28. The amount of food you get is such a great deal. When we come back to Arizona we will be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very deserving of a five star rating. Several times throughout our dinner reservation, we were surprised by the pride they take in their craft. From the chef sent filet mignon taster to the raspberry sorbet pallet cleanser to the moment we walked out was pure excellence. Our steak was cooked as ordered and tasted as good as in my dreams. I can't wait to go back and try more of their menu."}
{"text":"I was amazed that a steak house inside a casino would be so good.  They treat you like royalty and the food was so impressive.  I had a steak and it was amazing.  The broccoli was crisp and fresh."}
{"text":"I was in town for the 2014 Arizona Ironman and was in need of a good steak. I didnt want to spend $30-40 on a steak at the restaurants around where I was staying and came across Cholla.
Sat at the bar and had quick efficient service. There was  a smoker at the bar but i moved to the far end of the bar and didnt smell it.
Spinach salad and the most awesome NY strip steak EVER! Seriously, this was worthy of a $30 price tag but these guys charge $21
Well worth the trip!"}
{"text":"This place is an absolute jewel. It was my girlfriends birthday... So we went on a Thursday evening. The restaurant looked full, but that's only because it lacks a bigger sized dining room. Decor is a 3.5/5, it comes of as a classy upscale place to dine, but the tangible cloths and tables are nothing to be impressed about. 

My gf had the Ceasar Salad as starters. $6 (we split) It was absolutely delicious. Then served us 3 types of breads (original, cherry infused, & pepperoni -which tastes much like pizza sticks) & they were absolutely awesome. While we ate, a server came along and gave us tiny little samples of cheese, steakbites, cornbread, sorbet, and other delicious munchies.

For our entrées we has 2 Filet Mignon plates, crab infused mash & sautéed asparagus. 

Each entree was only $22! The meat was tender and full of flavor! 

We didn't have any drinks this time around, but if they're as good as their food... They will be cheap and amazing! 

They topped it off with an 'on the house' old fashioned chocolate cake. It was AMAZING, and definitely put the cherry on top for the dinner. 

The staff was amazing throughout the entire process and created a great atmosphere. 

Look-
I know it's located at an old casino, and you might be reluctant to approach it for that manner... BUT, I promise to won't be disappointed. Your wallet & tummy will thank you!"}
{"text":"I took my dad here for his 60th birthday and I have to say that the food was amazing (try the elk, it was so tender)  and the service was what put it over the top. Everyone there from the hostess, to the waiter, to server, and even the bus boy was so attentive. I will be coming back for another special event in the future."}
{"text":"YESSS this place is awesome. I can't wait to go back. The prices here are super reasonable for what you get. Shrimp and crabmeat cocktail was good.. and so were the stuffed bacon wrapped chorizo dates.

My ribeye steak was even better.
I tried my boyfriend's scalloped potatoes they were creamy and delicious. Had I not been so naughty with food this past christmas season, I would have easily devoured the whole side of potatoes.. but too bad my conscious got the better of me this time.
The complementary piece of fillet when we sat down was great, and so were the complementary bacon cornbread+bread basket. 

Cholla's also gave us a small scoop of the sorbet as a palate cleanser which was a nice touch. For the price this place is legit. Honestly, the food, the service can't be beat."}
{"text":"We actually had a very disappointing experience. We had to send 2 out of 3 steaks back to be recooked. The recooks both came back incorrectly prepared. Asparagus was limp and woody at the bottom. The service did not make up for the poor food quality. We will not return"}
{"text":"hello there I wento this place on easter sunday what a wonderful time and yes first time too its such a  warm feeling place  check it out"}
{"text":"Very good place highly recommended a set of this is very good, The food is very tasty, New York Stake is awesome!!!and the place itself is very nice and elegant ."}
{"text":"If you don't want to have your mind blown because the best piece of meat you've ever eaten was at a casino, then don't go here! Otherwise, prepare to have you mind blown because that piece of meat is only $22!"}
{"text":"Wow. This restaurant has to be subsidized by the casino.  Because for what I paid, the dining experience screamed value value and class!  Ordered a glass of red with the ribeye. Before the main course were 3 amuse bouches compliments of the house that were sparkling in flavor and joy. You cannot get steak this good, with this ambience, this service, the generosity of the kitchen.  I am in town for another month and I can't wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"Don't go...horrible place.  Bad!.  Oh, did I give it a 4?  Must have been a mistake.  I'm going to go back in a few weeks and give you a more thorough review.  May have to go again in August. just to keep you up to date on this horrible place.

But a true, honest criticism...there is NO non-smoking area in this entire casino.  Not even in Cholla's lovely bar area.  I guess that's where I meant to award the 1 star.  The waitstaff could use a bit of training - this restaurant truly wants to be a 5 star, and almost makes it...just train the employees a bit more to 5 star service.

We had Chateaubriand...not nearly as tasty and tender as I expected, but still excellent and an excellent price.  And done just to our order.  Asparagus was wonderful - wish I had ordered a double helping.  The au gratin potatoes were a huge disappointment....need to get the cheese into the layers, not just on top.  The creamed spinach was wonderful as was the bread - especially the cornbread. (Next time, I ask for extra).  And the seafood bisque was wonderful!!

All in all, a fine experience.  I just hope they can make a few improvements and I'll be happy to give them another star!

And get the damn cigarettes out of the bar!"}
{"text":"I have heard quiet a lot of positive reviews of this place which is adjacent to the Showroom at Casino Arizona.  I am very pleased to review that the solid reviews do hold up! We dined in a beautiful quaint restaurant with excellent service and the food was wonderfully delicious. He had the ribeye medium rare with a choice of two sides for only $20. She/I had the filet mignon with shrimp and choice of two sides for $26.  

     Both dishes were cooked as ordered and I especially loved my filet. It was extremely tender and flavorful, the asparagus spears where lightly grilled and crisp the way I like it and the garlic mashed potatoes, YUM!  Unfortunately, the potatoes au gratin was raw and not cooked. But, they brought out the mashed potatoes to substitute and apologized.  We were also served fresh baked bread in a variety of flavors: white, wheat-oat and a spiraled pepperoni bread, bacon cornbread and with a side of their Amaze-Balls pesto! I loved it so much they gave me a hand printed recipe! Say what?!?! Who does that? Sweeeeet!  We also received a complimentary raspberry sorbet prior to our entrees and raspberry chocolate truffles at the end of our meal.  Not only is the food at an incredible deal, it's flavorful, great portion sizes including the meat cuts. Super delish and you get waaaay more than what you pay for!

     I cannot believe this is our first time here. We have normally dined at Willows inside the casino after a show, but now this is another favorite in this small casino.  I found it very interesting that the manager of Cholla informed her husband is also the manager at Willows. I'm like score! They are obviously doing something right with both places and married. So cool!  Excellent staff all around from the wait staff to the management. We will definitely return. You can't beat this incredible deal! Extreme value! I'm bringing my family here when they visit!!

Thank you Cholla for a wonderful dining experience! :)"}
{"text":"One of the best deals and food in the Scottsdale area,  we were not really sure about being located in the casino, the good thing is parking was easy and plenty of open spaces.

Walking through the casino smelled of lots of smoke and the sounds of slot machines,  as soon as we walked into Cholla, no more smoke it was a top notch steak house with a great ventilation system hard to believe a casino was only a few feet away.   We had a party of 18 people with some kids they did a great job of balancing the adults and kids.   The food was great, I had a tenderloin with veggies and a wedge salad.

The salad had great chunks of blue cheese and bacon.
The steak was cooked perfect and very big for the price $22

Good bread and a pesto sauce to dip in.

You could pay more but not really get more than Cholla, it is small and comfortable so you may need reservations.

Enjoy..."}
{"text":"I've been to cholla twice had great service both times. Today my father and his wife  wanted to take me to dinner my choice. Now my dad thinks The Texas RoadHouse is phenomenal.  I said alright let's go to cholla. And they couldn't believe the classy ness upscale feeling that cholla steakhouse gave them. They ordered a rib eye steak and lobster tail for $25. Cause it was my birthday a round of drinks were comped as well as the desert. I recommend the filet and lobster mashed potatoes. And if you can handle dessert get the Royal Flush chocolate cake !!!! Cholla steakhouse is one of the hidden gems of Scottsdale!!! Check it out!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem in phx. Good service food and great prices for everything you get. They brought a piece of beef to the table as soon as we sat down bread cornbread and dips then sorbet palette cleanser and meal came. Even gave us a sweet at the end of the meal. Prices are amazing for what you get!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about dining here. The food, atmosphere and service were all top notch. The price was extremely reasonable. 

The chef sent out a couple sample items which were all fantastic. Loved the lemon sorbet as the intermezzo. 

I had the ribeye and my husband the filet. Both were cooked perfectly and the addition of two sides with the entree was a nice surprise. 

This is truly a hidden gem in the Valley and the best steakhouse we have visited in Arizona. We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant several times. The food is always really good. It is a 5 star restaurant at 4 star prices. The little extra touches they do really make you feel special. First they bring out a sample from chef for you to try. After your first course they bring out sherbet. Which only fine dining establishments do. After dinner they bring hot towels to wipe your hands. Staff is on top of things. Always filling your water glass and bringing more bread.  The only problem is the restaurant is small."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time last evening and it was very delicious. We did not order any starters as our server confirmed that the amount of food that comes with the entrees would be plenty and boy, was she right. The complimentary bread, amuse buche and pallet cleansing sorbet were great. My husband ordered the filet and I ordered the NY strip. Both were very flavorful; he upgraded to the corn casserole and i got the au gratin potatoes and carrots.  If anything, we found the sides to be a little under seasoned. We had a bottle of wine with dinner and finished off sharing the chocolate cake which was wonderful. Very reasonable for the quality of service and food received. We will be back again!"}
{"text":"Very decent steakhouse within the casino. Small but great service and exceptional meal for the price. When was the last time you took the wife to a prime beef steakhouse and spent less than $100? Is that even possible anymore?
Had the prime filet and it came with 2 sides! What the? And on top of that , pallet cleansers between courses. Pretty awesome steakhouse. A must try. But you see, they get you on the restaurant and murder you in the casino."}
{"text":"This place is a diamond in the rough. Their food is amazing and they give you a lot! I got the surf and turf which came with two sides including lobster mashed potatoes that were to die for and they had some corn that was awesome and some tasty fries. My boyfriend is a plain jane and got the burger but he said it was one of the best he has had. The serve a little teaser at the beginning, give you amazing bread and even a palette cleanser. This place is just the best! A little chocolate truffle to end the dinner and we were stuffed. The drinks are delicious as well and the atmosphere is quaint. Definitely go!"}
{"text":"I am dumbfounded by the high ratings. We were in town from California to celebrate family members' 70th anniversary. Yep, 70th! We wanted to make it really special. Moreover, there is nothing fancy in Maricopa. 

The service: Really good. Super friendly staff. 

The food:  BAD! We ordered three ribeye specials and rack of lamb. The elderly couple ordered their ribeyes well done. The other medium rare. As for my lamb, I wanted medium rare. To start, they gave us a sample of filet mignon and hot towels. The bread basket came with regular artisan, pepperoni, and bacon corn bread in a mini cast iron. STALE! The pepperoni bread fell apart and bit gritty. The corn bread was a bit undercooked and soggy; we used the spoon to eat it. The pesto was good with the regular bread. 

We also ordered a shrimp and seafood cocktail. The shrimps were big and decent. The cocktail sauce was good, but there was very little crab with a lot of baby purple lettuce buried at the bottom of the martini glass. The special also included blue cheese wedge. The assault of blue cheese! Luckily, they gave us raspberry sorbet to clean the palate. 

\"Creamy\" spinach and corn came in separate mini oval cast-iron cocottes. Cute! The \"creamy\" part is more watery with undercooked cheese on top. The spinach was bland! We thought perhaps the main course will redeem this bad experience so far. 

The main courses: 

Ribeyes - charred black! They couldn't even cut their meat! (See picture!). Literally tasted like charcoals. The medium rare steak was full of gristle and stringy. More blue cheese chunks loaded on top of the steaks. The lamb was raw, blood oozes into the plate, and cold in the center. No flavor! The garlic mashed potato was the only good thing on my plate. Asparagus was undercooked and stringy. 

We ended the dinner with complimentary raspberry macarons. We told them that we were here to celebrate a 70th anniversary, not even an offer complimentary dessert. We saw numerous pictures of complimentary anniversary dessert."}
{"text":"This place serves good, seasonal food and has a nice staff. It's super quiet and the ambiance is nice. They pay careful attention to detail in both the setting and the food. If your normal dining out experience consists of Applebees or the like than this place would definitely fit into the special-occasion category.

I had the 8 ounce filet on the grill and it was perfect."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS ALWAYS ON REPEAT!!! My husband and I have been going here for the past 10 years! We've celebrated our anniversary's, birthday's and \"just because we feel like steak days\" here!!! 

We are steak lovers and this place is the BEST out here in AZ! The prices are unbeatable for a great steak dinner and soup! OMG! It's sooo yummy!  The customer service is always great here! The menu has changed overtime but is still amazing! The actual menu used to light up but they changed it, I do miss that...lol.
The last time we went with no reservation it was going to close but they were wonderful and let us dine. The seafood bisque is always my favorite! You cannot go wrong getting this... Unless you're allergic to crab, shrimp or scallops. The asparagus is perfect with mashed potatoes that are amazing! My favorite is the ribeye! So ono and cooked to perfection every time I eat here! It will be done just the way you want. Customer service here is on point! The waiter is so cool he knows we love this place! We always compliment the chief. My husband is a big critic when it comes to steak so eating here we have never experienced a bad sit in ever.
If you want a great steak dinner that tastes better than Outback and their outrageous prices? Than come eat here, you will not be disappointed!;)"}
{"text":"This was a truly amazing dining experience.  I was a little suspect when I found it was in a casino but based on the reviews here I chose to give it a shot.  

Bad:  nothing at all

Good:
   - very clean an smelled great (as compared to the casino which allows smoking)
   - clean and modern decor 
   - wait staff was excellent - cheerful and helpful
   - service was quick but not too fast 

Great: The ribeye steak.  Honestly, I am not just saying that.  I have traveled the world and always try to find a great steak wherever I go.  Previous to this steak, my favorite was a little place in Australia.  The steak served at Cholla's was absolutely amazing.  Great flavor, very tender, and cooked to perfection.  

Do yourself a flavor - go to Cholla."}
{"text":"Wanted to love this place because I heard it was a great value for good steaks in Scottsdale. First off, the casino it is in is SUPER smokey. The restaurant itself is quiet and not smokey, but the walk to get in from the freshair is brutal on your lungs. 

Waiter was Santiago. Got our drink order wrong (1/3 right), was not able to answer our questions, and was not attentive at all. 

Ordered the full house- filet and prawns. They were not prawns, they were small shrimp. Filet was good for the price. 

App was the shrimp and crab- tasted like crab out of a can that had been sitting out. 

Overall decent place but needs improvement."}
{"text":"We have been here a number of times before tribute band concerts at the casino (also an excellent value!).  The food is good, and always consistent.  The  prices are VERY reasonable.    The appetizers, salads, and main courses are all good.   They even serve an amuse bouche and a palate cleanser (sherbet) - suspiring given the prices!    I am pretty picky about desserts and I have not really liked the ones I have tried so I have stopped ordering them."}
{"text":"I wish Yelp had a 4.5 star button because that is exactly what this place deserves.  We went to the casino that this was located in, and my girlfriend remarked that the spot was a diamond in a nicotine filled desert.  I think that's accurate.  The casino itself isn't much, and this place is definitely a nice find in the middle of it.  It outclasses its surroundings which is great.  We took a look at the menu, and were shocked a the value to be had.  Our waitress remarked, \"Honey, we're inexpensive not cheap!\"  Definitely true.  The food was pretty good, we both got the filets.  My filet was the right temperature, but my girlfriend's was a little rare, even to the point of being blue.  The service and the deserts were fantastic.  I really had a great time here, and I think the prices were great but the incorrectly cooked steak knocks a star off.  We will be back again!  Our favorite deserts were the strawberry shortcake, and the royal flush....  Mmmm"}
{"text":"Wonderful staff. Destiny took such good care of us. From the moment we were seated, we felt like royalty. And all the little touches were so yummy..the pesto sauce for bread, the sorbet to cleanse our pallets, the cold forks for our salads. Just a really great place to get yummy food and top notch service. We split the porter house steak for two and it was amazzzzzing!"}
{"text":"Went here Saturday night to celebrate my wife's birthday. Had a mix up with our reservation but after a while it was straightened out and we were seated. I had the filet mignon wrapped in bacon and my wife had the lamb chops. Both dishes were superb. Destiny, our server, was exceptional and we even got a chocolate moose cake birthday surprise for dessert. 
As always the food and service were unforgettable. Thanks for helping make my wife's birthday special. We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  The best food and service.  I love the filet and the lobster mashed potatoes!  I highly recommend coming here.  Book reservations early, they go fast!"}
{"text":"Probably the best filet I've ever had, the service was amazing and the prices are so cheap!  The only downfall is walking through the smoke filled casino to get to the restaurant! My husband and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Hands down, one of the best steakhouses I have ever been to.

Walked in to a 15 minute wait, but they called me on my cell phone when the table was ready. On the dot 15 minutes. 

Sat down and was delighted with a small sample of exquisite Filet Mignon. It was so good that I ordered exactly that. Medium came in exactly as wanted. Deliciously marinated and spiced. At $22 for a Filet Mignon, I can easily say, it's the best 5-star Filet Mignon under 25 bucks. Came with two delicious sides- I got broccoli and mashed potatoes. Best broccoli I have ever had. Got the crab filled shrimp appetizer and it did not disappoint.

We had Sangria and it was priced well and was delicious. They also brought out bread during the wait.

Very good experience. Will come back again."}
{"text":"The best steak I've had in a long, long time. Cooked perfectly, it melted in my mouth. The service was flawless! Can't wait to return!!"}
{"text":"On the outskirts of Scottsdale, in the Arizona Casino is Cholla, a small classic American steakhouse.

Price vs value at Cholla is excellent. Never before have I had white tablecloth dining at a steakhouse, and paid less than $60 for 2 steak meals. For $22, the filet mignon is a super deal. 

 Santi and his serving assistant provided excellent service. If I lived in Phoenix I would try to make dining at Cholla a weekly occasion."}
{"text":"Wow! I am amazed this place got 5 stars from so many people & feel duped & disappointed that 5 of us celebrated my husband's birthday there. Someone wrote it was like Mastro's with outback prices.  Obviously they have never been to Mastro's. 
  First, you have to walk thru the smokey casino to get to the restaurant. The set up borders on diner with the exposed kitchen & extremely noisy bussing area, but then they throw in linen table cloths like its fine dining. Pick one- noisy bistro or quiet dining. The web site says dressy attire so we dressed up. Then it turns out we were dressed better than the hostess & many of the other patrons had on shorts & Capri pants. Again, choose what you are going to be & stick with it. We dressed for Ruth Chris not Sizzler. 
  Food was up and down. We liked the calamari & stuffed dates. The Caesar salad & bisque were good too as was the bread service. Again, another  identity crisis-  a warm towel service & amuse Bouche of meat & a sherbet (not sorbet) palate cleanser yet they didn't bring plates for the appetizers so we ended up using  our bread plates, which got all sticky & dirty & were never cleared. Steaks were fine but skip the gloppy mushroom sauce. Sides were ok but not wonderful. Dessert was a catastrophe. The brought out creme brûlée which was not torched because \"the torch wasn't working\". Fine, then don't offer it! The kitchen should never have sent it out. Plus the custard itself was grainy and goopy. The royal flush had artificial raspberry glop smeared on the plate & was waxy. None of us ate more than 2 bites of any of the desserts. 
  We don't go to casinos because of the smoke smell, which we could smell in the restaurant. Talk all you want about their great ventilation system then come smell my dress. You also had to exit the restaurant & go into the casino to use the restroom. 
  We all agreed we would never go back. Don't confuse this place with fine dining. It is not. It is cheap food & you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Came here with my loved one to celebrate our anniversary, our first time here and loved it. We arrived around 5:30 we made a reservation beforehand. There was about two other people, but soon enough filled up. The food and service just about sealed the deal. Great place to dine."}
{"text":"Hands down the best steakhouse I have ever eaten at!!! The filet and grilled prawns were amazing, every single bite was to die for."}
{"text":"Who would of thought a casino would have a delicious steak house?!!!! When our navigation directed us to the casino we thought we were lost but we weren't. The food was very delicious more than what we expected. Also the service here was great!"}
{"text":"Wife and I came here to celebrate our anniversary and had a wonderful meal! While it is right in the middle of Casino Arizona, once you are inside Cholla it doesn't feel like a casino anymore.  Warm decor and draped windows block views and most sounds from the casino floor.

Service was friendly and attentive (thank you Sam).  The meal came at a good cadence...not too much waiting and not rushed.  Started with bacon wrapped chorrizo stuffed dates (yum).  My wife had filet that cut like butter.  I had ribeye.  Both were very good  and cooked perfectly.  Overall a great experience.  We wanted to splurge a little for our anniversary.  But prices were very reasonable for a meal of this quality so we'll be back soon!  Probably should make a reservation as this is a fairly small (cozy) space."}
{"text":"Average steakhouse. Above chain steakhouse prices, but about the same quality. Located inside the Arizona Casino, so it was extremely smoky.  Small, but practically empty. Unless you're a gambler, it's not worth the visit."}
{"text":"Delicious steak and accompaniments. The wait staff is friendly and give you an experience there.

It is very inexpensive compared to other steakhouses in Phoenix with tastier food. 

The only downside to the restaurant is that it's inside the casino, so unfortunately you smell cigarette smoke constantly."}
{"text":"This is the real deal! The filet mignon is super yummy, but you can't miss when you share the Chateaubriand for 2, it is to die for! Order it medium rare and you're good to go! Great service, and very accommodating! But, remember to make a reservation and ask for a booth if that's your preference, they only have 3! The prices are so good, it's clear that this place is subsidized by the casino!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Excellent service. Recommend about anything and everything on the menu. 
Intimate little gem hidden inside a casino."}
{"text":"Out the door....tax, title, and license we paid $54 for two meals.

A 14 oz ribeye with two  sides (asparagus and scalloped potatoes), then an 8 oz filet topped with crab meat, sauce, two sides (garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus), and a Caesar salad. 

We also had a nice tea for just $1 (way better than McDonald's haha). 

We were given a complimentary bite of filet when we sat down, pepperoni bread, cheese bread, and bacon corn bread (I wasn't find of this though) and between courses, they gave us a tiny scoop if sorbet to cleans thy pallet! 

Best steak meal for an awesome price! Come check it out!"}
{"text":"Visited for first time tonight, amazing filet and great prices! The blood orange sorbet was a nice addition before meal arrived too!"}
{"text":"Please see last paragraph for updated review from 8/20/17. 

We had the pleasure of dining here on Saturday evening to celebrate our son's high school graduation. We were thrilled with not only the fantastic food, but the service was first class. Our only regret is that after living in the valley for over 40 years and experiencing inconsistencies with the local 5 Star establishments...that we never came here!! The food was delicious (we had filet mignon, rib eyes and salmon) and the service was wonderful. Yes, as per some of the prior reviews, walking through the smoke filled casino is a bit of a negative, but we felt it was well worth the two minute breath holding. They also (without request) presented our son with a lovely congratulations slice of cake (I mentioned it was his graduation dinner when I made the reservation because I was a little concerned with timing and possibly being late). This will be our new place to come on a frequent basis!!

Am updating my review and changing to 3 stars. The service was wonderful as always (ILSE is great) and my husband's lamb chops and son's filet were very good;however, my rib eye was awful. I've had it there before and it was great, but tonight, it was truly inedible (gummy, thinly sliced and no taste except for the sauce). I literally had two bites. My son & husband tasted it and were shocked at just how bad it was (perhaps a bad cut of meat)?  I told Ilse, but no one came to ask us about it. I will say though that I finally tried the lobster mashed potatoes and they were FANTASTIC!! This was our anniversary and eating potatoes and asparagus is not something I had planned for dinner. Not certain we will go back. I had originally downgraded to 4 stars, but my husband thought that to be too generous given that my evening was not what it should have been.

AND NO COMMENT FROM MGMT.... THAT SPEAKS VOLUMES. WOULD HAVE MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE...will never recommend again."}
{"text":"Mhmm, what can I say about Cholla's? Atmosphere: the ambiance was relaxing and classy. You can come here for almost any occasion. We were there for my friend's birthday on a Saturday. Service: Great & attentive. From our hostess, who was friendly and funny, to our server, David, who was witty and helpful, to the kind people who filled out water glasses. The service here was good, keep up the good work. Food: i ordered the chorizo stuffed dates wrapped in bacon as my appetizer. They were so tasty, the only con is that they only served 3 dates. Ugh, no enough I wish it were 5 dates instead. I took a while to order my entreé, even though I did my research on the food prior to coming here. I ended up ordering the ribeye steak with asparagus & potatoes su gratin. The potatoes were okay, I really wanted to try the creamed spinach, maybe next time. The asparagus was great. Now the ribeye steak was amazing! I normally do not eat steak, but I decided to eat it that night because I was at a \"prime steakhouse\". The porcini mushrooms, brandy pepper cream tasted great with my well done steak. I wish I could have eaten it again. The food was fantastic. Miscellaneous: They gave my friend a complimentary slice of chocolate cake for her birthday with was nice. In between our appetizers (including the various breads and yummy corn bread), they served us complimentary sorbet, which was tasty and complimentary pistachio covered chocolate truffles at the end of our meal. Overall, I would definitely come here again for a nice steak dinner with an appetizer for under $30."}
{"text":"Just an awesome ribeye. Absolutely fantastic. Recommend the place. 5 stars only because they did not have seven. Great  service. Fantastic experience."}
{"text":"Gem inside of a casino az ... Wow ambiance , service of top notch restaurant and price unbeatable .  Fillet was amazingly tender, taste like $50 steak instead of $22 with 2 amazing sides.    I don't want to share because place is small, roomy but they only put couple tables in so privacy, great place for a date night you can wow your date :) 

They even brought pallet cleanser sorbet. Nice touch :) and even though we had no room for their fantastic looking desert they gave us home made strawberry truffle thing,  awesome !"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to try this place for some time now & it definitely lived up to my expectations, SO good! The wine prices are amazing - we got a bottle of the Dark Horse cab for $29, the complimentary bread was amazing (pizza bread.. ugh so good), and then we got filet mignon & two sides ($24) & the Porterhouse for two + two salads and two sides ($49). We got the lobster mac&cheese, carrots, broccolini, potatoes au gratin, and something else that I cant remember. Everything was GREAT! It is a very small restaurant with very limited seating - especially at the bar, so make sure to make a reservation."}
{"text":"I love this place!! You wouldn't think this place serves such upscale and wonderful food by the looks of it, but it does! Oh, and the service is outstanding!!! The chef sent out a one bite appetizer which was filet mignon and it melted in your mouth! 

My husband had my 50th Birthday there and they over and beyond to make my night special. They made a beautiful pink and green birthday cake, my sorority colors, and it was gorgeous! Not only was it gorgeous but it was actually moist and flavorful! 

I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place has great food and some of the staff is good, but some of the staff is HORRIBLE.  Just know, what you get is what you get.  This isn't fine dining and they don't act like a restaurant.  These are casino workers just trying to get by.  DO NOT EXPECT SERVICE.  I was appalled at the way the staff behaved."}
{"text":"I'm embarrassed to say... I left here holding my distended belly.  Everything was so good and the service was excellent.  My husband got the full house with a filet mignon, grilled shrimp, asparagus and mashed potatoes, while I got the NY strip with mash and broccolini.  it was all very delicious, my only... \"regret\" ( is such a strong word\" is that I honestly would have preferred my steak without the sauce.  It just didn't need it- the steak was good quality, perfectly salt & peppered and cooked between medium rare and medium (my preference) it was perfect all by itself.  My husband and I have spent $100-$350 on dinner before and this meal easily topped all of them.  The fact that we walked out of there for $96 uncluding a well deserved 35% tip... amazing.  You gotta go here."}
{"text":"Words cannot express how much I love this place. It is definitely my favorite steakhouse I've ever been to, and not even just in Phoenix.

Such reasonable prices, and the tasting spoon, bread basket and pallete cleanser that comes before your entree is phenomenal. The intro alone to your meal is worth 4 stars.

Bread:There is a variety of breads, including one with bacon swirled into the bread, and amazing mini jalapeno-cornbread skillets. It is to die for. The bread also comes with a pesto dipping sauce. 

The tasting spoon (don't know what to call it lol): Every night, the chef prepares a one-bite tasting spoon--my favorite was a bite of filet mignon with bleu cheese crumble over some arugula. 

Pallete Cleanser: Lemon Sherbert! So refreshing and delightful!

And then the entrees. I have had Lamb and Filet, and they have always been perfectly cooked. Their mushroom sauce is amazing. Everything my husband and his family gets always looks amazing as well--I don't think they can do anything wrong!

We also always get the Sweet Corn Casserole! It's one of the prime sides for $5 and it's large enough that I always have leftovers for another meal the next day. It is so delicious -- crunch, sweet, creamy -- and tastes just as good the next day.

The entrees range between $20-$30 for their steaks, which is on par or cheaper than other steak houses. But what you get for the money is way more worth it. The same entree at Monti's is $40+, and I don't enjoy it nearly as much! 

All in all, I cannot tell you how much I love this place. I love it so much I'm always waiting for the next holiday so I can suggest Cholla's as a place to eat :P"}
{"text":"YUMMY!!! Went here with a group of 5 & had great service, great food & great atmosphere. Had the Filet Mignon...cooked to perfection and very tasty. Most dishes you get two sides and the sides are not small portions, but fairly large. They always have a special for a main dish as well as for a bottle of wine. Really enjoyed my meal and cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Went here last night for the first time with my boyfriend to celebrate his birthday. I would suggest making a reservation, because the place is small. I do appreciate that the restaurant is enclosed, because it is right off the casino floor & I would not have enjoyed the smoke while trying to eat. 

My boyfriend & I both has the NY strip with a salad appetizer, I had the wedge (which is their house salad). The bacon on top looked extremely cheap, I kept calling it Subway bacon, because it looks like the type of cheap bacon Subway would have. The dressing was a blue cheese bacon which was good, but the lack of quality bacon was a little off putting. My boyfriend liked his Caesar & had no complaints. Also we both has drinks, I had a house wine (under $6 a glass) & he has an amber bock (under $5 a glass), so those prices were great.

They forgot to bring the bread everyone raves about. When we asked out waitress about it she apologized & it was brought out ASAP. The bread was okay. Next our meals, the steak was really good & cooked per my medium rare request. The sides, broccolini & mashed potatoes were both good as well.

Overall I would return & recommend it to others. Great meal at a good price with attentive & friendly service."}
{"text":"Excellent Service, exceptionally well prepared quality food and really reasonable prices. I am a fan and I will be back, soon!!!! I ordered the Ribeye grilled and it was seasoned to perfection!! The mushrooms were ample and flavorful.this was a comfortable atmosphere with exceptional staff, quality food prepared to perfection for a wallet friendly price. I'm looking forward to my next opportunity to return......"}
{"text":"Best upscale dining experience I have had in AZ. Hands down. And did not spend the whole weeks grocery money. From appetizers to palate cleansers to dessert, flawless execution. The steaks/filets were really good. .Did not care for the mushroom sauce, it tasted like raw garlic. But we had other things to dive into. Great anniversary spot. Too bad you have to walk through lung cancer alley to get here..."}
{"text":"We had dinner at Cholla Steakhouse last night and we were pleasantly surprised how good it was. The wine and food were terrific. The prices are very reasonable. The service is good, atmosphere is classy and cozy. You can leave the smoke and noise of the casino and enjoy a great dinner."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful!!! From the food to the bartender, Brent, everything was amazing. Brent was so incredibly personable and made great recommendations. We had a great time and will definitely come back if in Scottsdale again!!"}
{"text":"1 word .... Outstanding!!  My wife and I had the 32oz porterhouse special for 2.   We received 2 Caesar salads, and 2 sides a piece.  All top notch.  This is a must try .... If looking for a fine steakhouse with a reasonable price .. This is the place to go.  Sami was our waiter and he was excellent!  We are definitely coming back when in this area."}
{"text":"We had a very good experience at this restaurant.  The Cesar salad was tasteful and the crab and shrimp cocktail appetizer was delicious.  We ordered the porterhouse special and the steak was tender and well prepared.  The restaurant has a quaint ambiance and excellent service. We would definitely recommend it to our friends!"}
{"text":"This was my favorite restaurant. The husband and I thought we'd drop-in for dinner. We were aware that we would have to wait sine I didn't make a reservation. We arrived around 7:30 pm and cane in prior to a white couple. Everyone was greeted by the hostess who said that they had one table which was reserved,but if the individuals did not show up at 8, their table would be able to us. All 4 of us were exported to the bar,where we waited until 8:05pm. No new customers walked in. The hostess walked right past us towards the couple who had also arrived AFTER us who also did not have a reservation and proceeded to sit them. I stopped her and asked why,and that my husband and I has arrived first. She proceeded to tell me that they has a reservation. I said,funny, we checked in at the same time and we were both told that we would have to wait because we didn't have a reservation. I will never eat at or recommend this restaurant again! Don't dine while black at this place because you'll be waiting a very long tine to be seated,if at all"}
{"text":"Lisa D

I had out-of-town company and needed a restaurant that was a midway point between North Phoenix and Mesa.  I have been to Casino Arizona many times to dance in their lounge  So I was very surprised to find a 5 star restaurant at their location,  Well I have to tell you what a wonderful find.  The food was AMAZING, the service superb and the level of detail so refreshing.  The wonderful little goodies in-between courses was such a nice touch.  Four of us had chateaubriand (mine was rare the other was medium rare) and it was the best steak I have ever eaten.  Now I am a bonafide foodie - big time.  My husband and I are going back often.  But I tell you you better make reservations because this is not a large restaurant and with food this good at an unbelievably reasonable price it is packed."}
{"text":"Great steak with very reasonable prices. I had the filet with prawns and 2 sides for $26 what a great value.  Comes with homemade breads and pesto garlic dip, and bacon corn bread.  The only downside is very small restaurant and you can hear the casino slots ringing during your whole meal.  Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Service stands out at this place. You get the full Steakhouse experience as fine dining. A hot towel, great assortment of breads, and sorbet before the main course. Even better, you don't have to pay a lot. My ribeye was a little over 20 bucks with two side dishes included. 

You'd expect the food quality to suffer for this value, but you would be wrong. Steak was tender and cooked perfectly, shrimp and King crab cocktail was stellar, and the Chocolate coffee mousse was an unnecessary but wonderful indulgence. 

The only downside is that I don't live here and can't come back for a while!"}
{"text":"Alarmingly great food, service and price! I couldn't believe all the little extra perks such before the meal such as: bread with sauce, brussetta and ice cream to cleanse the palate. Amazing wine selection! I ordered the salmon with lobster mash potatoes and my date ordered the special. I would suggest this place for a Birthday celebration because it's affordable and comfortable. Definitely make a reservation ahead of time. It's packed all the time."}
{"text":"First let me say I want to LOVE this Place. I LOVE that I can wear shorts and a t-shirt to have a nice steak dinner. I will start at the beginning. The reservation at 5pm on October 4th, 2014 was made and it was notated that it was a Birthday celebration. Cool. We show up at 5pm and are seated straight away, they just opened. Our Server Is Linda, if you have read other reviews she gets great raves. I ask for a Martini menu? No such thing so she went and asked and it seemed they really didn't have any infused vodka martinis so Vodka martini up it was. Husband had a draft Blue moon. We had looked at the menu ahead of time so we knew what we wanted and ordered. This place, as you have read, has a bunch of really nice little touches. The taste for today was a salmon sashimi. Not my cup of tea. The bread basket everyone raves about included Jalepeno bread, Cranberry bread and a dark Rosemary bread, all COLD and tasteless. It comes with pesto and butter, Pesto and Cranberry bread? OK, no big deal. Linda is extremely attentive but the star of this show is THE BUSMAN, who is about 50% waiter. He is superb and on point,. So husband orders the Elk Tenderloin and a Wedge salad. I ask Linda for her suggestion between the shrimp cocktail and the stuffed shrimp and she say go with the cocktail. I wish I hadn't, the cocktail sauce was so heavy with horseradish I couldn't use it so there's that. I followed with the Seafood Soup OMG! it was huge and PURE heaven! I wish I had just stopped there but hey it was my Birthday! I ordered the Filet and again asked Linda for her advise on temp because servers know how their chef's cook. Medium isn't medium everywhere. I told her just PINK throughout and she said medium. Cool. It came with my choice and I picked Au Gratin Potatoes. The small restaurant is filling up fast now and Linda where did you go? We never saw her again, well we did, she was in the room, just not at our booth. I have worked in the food industry and I think her  \"station\" (the tables they work) got changed and we were no longer in her station. Someone else brought out entrees, Husband loved his, mine, well it was RAREY RARE RARE. Should I have sent it back? Well, no one was there to send it to and Husband asked me not to so we could eat together. I ate my au gratin Potatoes and they were good! I took all but 2 bites of the Filet home with lots of potatoes. Again Thanks BUSMAN for packaging that up! Husband wanted dessert and coffee but no on came.....ever. A very loud drunk 4top was seated behind us and I was done. Husband considered it free entertainment. No Birthday dessert,  no coffee. He finally took out his AMEX and put it where it could be seen although we had No check.  The manager sees it and processes it and it's $100 and where are the little tiny sweets that are presented with the check...NOWHERE. Not a Happy Birthday Dinner for me, but this place has a lot going for it, I would suggest if you are celebrating a life moment, come on a weekday evening because Saturday night , even at 5pm didn't cut it. We left 15% because Damn That BUSMAN earned it."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our dinner. The servers were very attentive, and the food was delicious. The best part: I don't feel like I overspent. Great value all around. Wonderful experience; we will be back!
I wish the restaurant had its own door to the outside though. Walking through the smoky casino sucks! Hold your breath."}
{"text":"Excellent value.  Good service.  Would definitely return,  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Wife and I went for the first time Wednesday.  It was WONDERFUL !!! Yevette's welcome, Destiny's great attentiveness and Romiro on top of everything. Food and  setting was very nice. Had one of the best steaks ever, 32 ounces of heaven....Go once, you will definitely return."}
{"text":"First of all, I can't imagine why there is a half star under 5!! I would give this place 10 stars if I could! In fact, I hate leaving a review so good because more people will go and we won't get a table!!  So, from the minute we walked in - perfect service! Our server was Ilse - she was the embodiment of perfect customer service - but the whole place is!!! We had the chateaubriand and sides 2 cocktails and a bottle of wine - $109 WHAT?? This is the best kept secret and I'm really having second thoughts about posting such a great review!! I want this place to myself!! Snowbirds, stay away!!!"}
{"text":"Love Love this place. So cozy. The food is fabulous and the prices are great. Sammy was the best server!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by this restaurant in a casino. Don't be fooled by the $$,it's better than a lot of $$$.  Better than even some $$$$. Absolutely perfect service and fantastic food. They give you three different breads at the beginning for free. The $8 stuffed bacon wrapped dates are highly recommended. They are so savory and rich. The lobster mash potatoes are $9 and delicious. Both of our steaks (Ribeye and Filet Mignon)were under $25. The steaks are perfectly cooked and the sides are generous. We didn't go with a reservation but the bartender Brent is first class."}
{"text":"This is perhaps the best deal and one of the best steakhouses I've been to anywhere, not just in Arizona. A gem, hidden in the back of the Casino Arizona is small and easy to miss, but shouldn't be. 

My wife and I went for a mini-date, a casual evening with some delicious steak and low minimum gambling (I taught her how to play Keno) and could not have been more impressed or pleased with the experience we had.

She ordered the Filet and I, the New York. The meal started off with a tenderloin ceviche, courtesy of the chef- the meat was tender and perfect and the ceviche had great flavor and I knew we were in for a treat that night. Then came the bread and my goodness was it good. There was quite the variety and of note, there was a pepperoni roll which was not overly greasy and went splendidly with the pesto dip which was offered in addition to the butter. Then came a small taste of blood orange sorbet (also delicious) which cleansed the palate for what was to come next.

Next came our steaks, which I won't say were the best steaks I've had in Phoenix (that honor goes to Donovan's so far) However, the portion was generous, the steak did not have pieces of tendon, not did it have large chunks of fat. It looked the way a steak at a high end restaurant is supposed to look and easily could have been presented as a 40-50 dollar steak without my batting an eye. This steak was only 22 dollars (her filet) and 21 for mine. That deal really can't be beat or matched. The steak was cooked properly, was high quality meat and had good flavor. The only negative I would say is that the desert actually quite bad. We had the creme brûlée- rather than save you the eyesore I would just say don't order it- the menu gives false description- there is no balsamic foam, the custard is partly liquid, the sugar crust is too thick, and burned. If the steak wasn't so delicious and at such a generous price point the desert alone would have decreased my rating but the steak is too good of a deal not to get a 5 star review- just get your desert elsewhere."}
{"text":"I went with a friend to dinner on 6/30/2017 . Would have ordered a steak but the waiter suggested the large  porterhouse  dinner for two for $49.95 which included two Ceasar salads, two sides each and a good size porterhouse. We ordered it Medium but it came Medium rare which was fine............it was delicious! For dessert we shared the Creme Brulee ($7.50) which came with a flourless chocolate cake layer underneath and some berry decoration.It was good but not great. The serving was  too small to share which was not expected since most desserts are usually too much for one person.
All in all a really enjoyable dinner with excellent  service for a very reasonable price .
Would definately go again!"}
{"text":"This was an amazing meal and such a surprise!! The steak special was cooked perfectly and all that came with it was delicious. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Wasn't sure about a casino restaurant... but this one really surprised me. Great service, and the filet was done perfectly. Caesar salad was exceptional. I would recommend it! We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great service and nicely designed restaurant.  Food was excellent.  Steak were cooked as requested..truly medium rare.  Appetizers tried: calamari, shrimp/crab cocktail and seafood bisque were all well done and in nice portions.  Nice find and would return again,"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best service, the best tasting meal at a reasonable price. There was nothing to critique, kudos to the chef! By the way, the pineapple tequila concoction they threw together was amaze. We will definitely return. So glad we tried this place out. Can't beat the complimentary Creme Brûlée for my Birthday!"}
{"text":"My go-to spot for a nice dinner with my girlfriend. Staff and service are always great and welcoming. The price for the food and service is unbeatable. I tend to describe this place to my friends as high end good and services with Olive Garden prices. After you are done with Dinner, you can always hang around for a little gambling to finish up the evening with some excitement. Strongly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"It's my birthday and I was looking and looking on Yelp to find the right place to enjoy dinner out with my sweetheart of 16 years!  After much looking at menus online, I finally decided on Cholla Prime Steakhouse that is inside Casino Arizona.  (I'm not much for casinos, but it's sooo close to home and why not try it?)    
     We got there right around 5pm when they open and were seated and greeting right away.  Each and every employee was very helpful and attentive throughout.  The menu was exactly as the website had shown (some restaurants are totally off on what they have online vs. in the restaurant.)  We each ordered steak meals.   I ordered an appetizer of Seafood Bisque.  OMG, I think it may have been the best one I've ever had!  Luscious, creamy and chocked full of shrimp, small scallops and crab meat.  Our server was Linda and she was so wonderful and was available and helpful and just perfect!  The manager, Joy, was checking in too and that made it even more special... sometimes we can't tell who is asking how our dinner is going.
      We were served about 6 slices of three kinds of breads, along with a pesto and soft rounds of butter.  Very nice.  There was a sorbet in between the appetizer and the entree!  I can't remember when that's happened, it's been so long!  (OK, OK... we haven't been to an upscale place in a long while...)   But Cholla wasn't the Putting on Airs type of fancy... it was a very comfortable place to be, and being waited on as if we were in a place that charges twice as much!   
      My partner had the Full House which was a Filet Mignon with Shrimp and she chose garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus.   I had the Ribeye with asparagus and scalloped potatoes.  The meat was cooked exactly to our requests.  Everything was DELICIOUS!  
      Let me sing and dance about our truly truly delightful and scrumptious dinner at Cholla.  We will definitely come back with friends and anyone who will join us!"}
{"text":"Love the quaint smaller restaurant with kitchen right there!! The food was excellent and the.service exceptional! We will be back!"}
{"text":"This was by far one of the best dining experiences I've ever had at a steakhouse! You get welcomed right when you step in,  seated and order taken promptly, and the entire staff make sure they check in on you to ensure you're comfortable.  I ordered a seafood bisque,  ribeye steak medium rare,  lobster mashed potatoes,  and creamed corn casserole.  

Prior to getting your meal,  they give you a hot hand towel and a complementary variety bread basket.  The bacon cornbread is individually made and paired with their jalapeño pesto dipping sauce was OMG. I dislike cornbread, so if I loved it then it is pretty damn good!

The seafood bisque was full of shrimp, scallops, and real pieces of crab which was surprising for the price. The steak was cooked as ordered and it was so tender and soft! The lobster mashed potato had real lobster pieces liberally placed within. The creamed corn casserole had a corn bread crust and bell peppers to give the corn an extra pop of taste. 

The one thing I was sad about was being so stuffed that I ended up packing most of my meal to go! This is Ruth Chris type of fine dining at Outback Steakhouse prices. If I visit the Phoenix area again,  I will definitely make sure I go back here!"}
{"text":"This place is so worth your money!  They give you a lot of little appetizers before your meal arrives, for example pate w cheese and crackers, bread with really yummy pesto, and a sorbet to cleanse your pallet before your steak arrives.  We got the rib eye and filet mignon, both were cooked perfectly to what we order.  I'm pretty picky about the way my steak is cooked, medium rare ! Services was a bit slow, seemed understaffed but they were very nice. Will come back to try more things."}
{"text":"Seriously delicious.   Started with the shrimp and king crab cocktail.   Nothing amazing, but solid.   All the seafood was cooked perfect.
I bucked the trend and had the steak and mushroom soup.  Absolutely legit.  Definitely recommend this option.
Elk tenderloin was spectacular.  Cooked perfect and served with a nice sauce.  The only weird part was the 5 raspberries on the plate.  Not sure of their purpose, but whatever.
Service was attentive and professional.
Give it a shot.  Show up hungry, go home"}
{"text":"I was curious to find out if the Yelp reviews were true.  They were.  This place was a great and affordable steakhouse.  For the quality food that you get and the excellent customer service, you can't beat it.

Our waitress was Linda and she did an amazing job.  You get a variety of bread for free with your meal and we even received cornbread as well.  Then they brought out a sample of steak and they brought a sample of raspberry sorbet shortly after that.

I ordered the filet mignon with a baked potato and asparagus and my date ordered the ribeye with a baked potato and carrots.  Everything was delicious and cooked correctly.  However, I plan to order a ribeye or strip next time because the filet mignon didn't fill me up enough.

This place is very nice on the inside and I highly recommend checking it out.  With our meals and two drinks, our bill was $48 and some change!  Not bad at all!"}
{"text":"Had dinner last night at Cholla and it was amazing.  Our server Linda was the best ever.  The food was the best I have had in a long time, the steak was done perfectly and the salmon was amazing.  We have been to Cholla a couple of times and each time the experience is outstanding.  Best place in the valley for a great meal."}
{"text":"Our anniversary dinner couldn't have been better. 5-star food, service and environment. Ask for the drink specials because there is always one on wine, liquor and beer. You may substitute both your included standard sides for one prime side; The lobster mashed potatoes were incredible. The amuse-bouches, specialty breads, entrees and desserts were exquisite. We had the Chateaubriand with béarnaise sauce and natural au jus which was prepared exactly as we asked. They brought us a creme brûlée with a chocolate disc which said happy anniversary.

There is limited seating, so reservations are recommended. We made our reservation online right through Yelp without issue including the fact that this was a special occasion. The bar area opens at 4:30pm while the restaurant area opens 30 minutes later."}
{"text":"What a fantastic experience!  Talk about value for the money!!!  As a family we took my mother out for dinner here for her birthday.  We ordered some fried calamari to start along with a bottle of pinot, then a couple of porterhouse steaks and the Chateaubriand for two.  Everything was done to perfection as ordered, and even the side dishes were quite tasty. The staff also brought out a hefty slice of chocolate cake on the house. My father who previously worked in meat inspection and grading said his porterhouse slab was one of the best steaks he's had it years!  The total bill came to only about $115 dollars!  You can hardly feed a family of four dinner at Denny's for that price, much less get anything decent. I see many return trips here.  Service was excellent and very professional; staff seemed to take the food and their service of it quite seriously.

And btw, I disagree with other reviews about the buffet at Casino Arizona as not so good.  The gem of their buffet is the weekday dim sum, which is far better than most Cantonese restaurants serve--if you can even find another restaurant in town that serves it.  The rest of the buffet may not offer the biggest range of items, but in my experience everything is exceptionally well-prepared and the place is squeaky clean."}
{"text":"The quality of the food and the service were far beyond what I would expect for the price range. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"You won't be disappointed. Amazing ambience, great service and the food is outstanding. You don't even know that you're in a casino. We have eaten here 5 times now, and every time has been nothing short of perfection. They start off by bringing you a dish sample (compliments of the chef) and warm hand towels. Then they bring the best hot/fresh bread I've ever had  after the bread they bring a scoop of sorbet to cleanse your pallet before the main course comes. We had the porterhouse for 2, came with 2 Caesar salads, two sides a piece and house made steak sauce. It was OUTSTANDING! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were in town for the weekend, so I checked yelp for a steakhouse recommendation. The positive reviews for this place caught my attention,  but the prices on the menu really hooked me. Went on a Thursday night  (not busy at all, btw) figuring, OK, decent meal at a decent price, nothing more, nothing less. Let me tell you, this place absolutely BLEW ME AWAY!

Our server Sami was very pleasant and very attentive. The restaurant is small, nice decor, just fancy enough. The first thing you get is a small sample of steak, I think more to highlight their demi-glace sauce than anything else. Seriously, who gives an amuse-bouche anymore? Impressive! Sami then tells us they have a special that night - a 32 ounce porterhouse for two, two sides each, and two Caesar salads.

$49. No, that's not a typo. And, honestly, the normal menu items aren't much more than that. And the sides are included in the menu prices, which is a pet peeve of mine with fancy a la carte steakhouses. 

Cutting to the chase: this was an absolutely excellent steak! Perfectly cooked, accompanied by bearnaise and demi-glace sauces, both very good. I had a potato gratin that was spot on! 

Total for dinner and two drinks: $70! I wish I could give this place 6 stars just for showing that you can have a nice meal at a nice place without breaking the bank!"}
{"text":"It was hard walking through the smoke filled casino.  However, once inside we had a great experience.  I love Maestro's and Steak 44 but for the money this place is a gold mine.  Two martini's, two sides each, a filet and NY strip, and a wedge for $80.  Wow, fantastic value.  The taste of the food was superb.  I knocked them down one as my steak was a little on the cool side.  If they can master the sizzling steak my rating would be a 6."}
{"text":"Went to dinner with some friends, its quit the cute little steakhouse! They gave us cloths to wash our hands, a sample piece of steak (not sure on cut) with some Bearnaise sauce.. The bread was really good, we got some just plain bread and then some with pepperoni, as well as some cornbread with bacon. The cornbread was WAY too sweet and i didnt taste any bacon. We also got a lemon sorbet pallet cleanser before our meal. 

My husband ordered the filet, and I ordered the the Rib eye... you get two sides with both meals. My husband chose broccolini, and the garlic mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes had a funky taste to them (i always seem to think this, not a fan of mashed at most restaurants, and it was fluffy like real potatoes as much as it was potato flakes.. like from a box, IDK though) I ordered the baby carrots and potatoes au gratin. My potatoes were soooo good, and the carrots were good. My steak came with a mushroom cream sauce, and it was cooked as i had asked (medium rare). However.... my steak was 1/2 fat... now i know that a rib eye is fatty cut.. but..... i would like to eat more than 1/2 my steak. The price is really good for what you get. The drinks are a little high priced... i had a glass of white blend and it was 13.50. One of the others i checked, the red blend was $10.50 a glass (this bottle retails for $10...) My husband had a normal 16oz glass of draft beer, and it was $9 

I highly recommend you make a reservation since this restaurant is so small! 

Since we live about 30mins away I dont see us coming here often unless we plan on a night of gambling."}
{"text":"Unbelievable! The service was impeccable. From the moment we sat down until we left. Yea! To guest service. 
Okay, now for the food. Amazing and delicious! 
Sat down and was served a sample of the Fillet Mignon with Béarnaise a lite sauce. It was so tender that was our choice for dinner. 
Joy, the manager was hands on to make sure everyone was happy and enjoying their dining experience. 
Our Server was excellent. 
We will return for sure."}
{"text":"This is one of my go to spots whenever I'm working in Phoenix. They have an absolutely great value on very good cuts of meat. I love their ribeye steaks, as well as the sides that you can order with them. Do yourself a favor and check this place out. You most definitely will not be disappointed.

The food is delicious, and the service is also top-notch."}
{"text":"Had the filet with au gratin potatoes and asparagus, my Mom had the same, but with the baby carrots.  Filet was superb and so well-priced.  It came with bernaise sauce but next time I will probably leave it off as the filet can stand on its own with no frills.  I thought the potatoes were a little too cheesy and rich, I only had a couple of bites.  Asparagus was perfectly cooked but the carrots could have used a little more cooking.  they were closer to raw than cooked.  Bread basket is awesome but beware it doesn't spoil your appetite."}
{"text":"Made reservations here with my family for my birthday after some research into Scottsdale's tastiest steakhouses. The dining experience exceeded our expectations. I was dying for a good ribeye and got exactly what I wanted. The food was absolutely delicious, very reasonably priced, and the staff took care of our table the entire time. They served unexpected treats and made my birthday all the more special this evening. Highly recommended. Will be back again."}
{"text":"There is a reason this place is five star! Here is 5 more! Great service. Delish food. And reasonably priced. Where we else can you get a filet dinner with two sides for under $30 a person! Portions are very reasonable and enough to make you full. Steak was cooked perfectly. And nothing to complain about. Perfect meal."}
{"text":"Floyd was awesome - excellent service.  Entertainment was great.  I would definitely recommend it for large groups."}
{"text":"I went here last night with my girlfriend when we were looking for a nice place to eat a upscale meal, and we were not disappointed. Not in the least. The meal was fantastic and the price was beyond fair. I felt almost criminal leaving there only paying what I did for the food and service!"}
{"text":"Love this place, we went there for celebrating my boyfriend's b-day. The food was great! Definitely recommend to my friends."}
{"text":"After reading all 5 reviews, I had to try it. The food was awesome at reasonable price. Good service, Ruth Chris prime quality meat at half the cost. Will be back for sure. We got the chateu filet for two with mashed potatoes, carrots and broccolli. All items wre good and we both loved the mashed potatoes over the gratin."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for our Mother's birthday and none of us were disappointed!  From the bread, 4 different varieties in one inspiring basket- to the decadent but not too sweet chocolate cake with a candle- it was a great experience. Our server David was attentive and pleasant, he treated the birthday girl like a rockstar!  Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Cholla Steakhouse really is, as so many others have already said, a true \"hidden gem\" of the Phoenix Valley!  The staff is so friendly and accommodating, every single item of the menu incredibly delicious, and not to mention probably the best value for your money that you will find at steakhouses around the valley!  The bartender is the nicest I have met in Phoenix, and his homemade watermelon vodka martini was fabulous!  To top it all off, they even included free dessert (a perfectly made creme brulee) for my birthday; what a thoughtful, nice surprise to end my special day!  We will definitely be returning and recommending Cholla Steakhouse as a \"must try\" restaurant of Phoenix. : )"}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant the other night, for my wife's birthday. We both really enjoyed our meal, from start to finish. It's a very small place, inside the Casino Arizona. Once inside the restaurant, you would have no clue there is a casino outside their door. No smoke smell or casino noise.
    A very nice bread basket was delivered to our table. It has soft patties of butter as well as  pesto flavored olive oil. Great presentation!
   They brought over two small pieces of tenderloin with a side of horse radish sause, for us to try. That was exceptional & we didn't even ask for it. How nice is that?
   They bring you a little scoop of lemons sorbet, to cleanse your pallet, before your meal. That was an unexpected pleasure and again, no charge. Very nice touch!
   I had the Steak & Mushroom soup. It had diced angus beef and Portobello & crimini mushrooms, in a cabernet brown broth. It was excellent and it was a meal in it self. The price was only $7. My wife had the Caesar salad and she said it was excellent. Both portions were very generous in size.
   Next came our main course. We split a Chateaubriand for two. The char-grilled tenderloin came sliced with a side of Aujus & Béarnaise. It was cooked perfectly and it tasted great. Price was $39.
    Our sides were Lobster mashed potatoes and au-gratin potatoes. Both were excellent. Price was included with our main course.
    Service was not at all rushed. Our young waitress wasn't very talkative and she did start to clear my plate while my wife was still eating. A little more training and she will be just fine.
    Dinner was so filling, we didn't have room for dessert. They did sound great, maybe next time.
   Our bill was extremely fair & reasonable. I already recommended this restaurant to two couples we know. Don't let the casino atmosphere deter you from this nice affordable restaurant. It's small, might seat 50 or 60 people, so call ahead and make a reservation, like we did. 
   My return factor is 85%"}
{"text":"Wow.  Outstanding Beef dishes at reasonable prices with great side dishes and desserts.
Tell no one about this place ad they may raise their offices.
Chateaubriand fir Two out of this world."}
{"text":"Their pesto is the best I've ever eaten!  The wedge salad is always perfect, The bisque is amazing, and every entrée I've had has always been good!"}
{"text":"Perfection!   We love a number of fine dining Steak Houses in town.  After last night, my husband said \"Hands down this is my fave!\"  That is saying a lot for a man who loves red meat.  We were celebrating our anniversary with a week of eating out-no better tribute!  Love this cozy romantic spot.  Sami was our server and he made sure this special eve was a true celebration.  We ordered the Special, a 32oz Porterhouse with Caesar Salads to share and two sides for each of us!  Whaaaaattt???  We both had the Broccolini and Au Gratin potatoes.  Both were perfectly cooked, which is often not the case.  The steak was divine!  Medium rare and tender as the day is long.  Our Joel Gott Zin was just the perfect accompaniment to the meal.  With a complimentary amuse bouche of filet and a sorbet palate cleanser-it was an over the top meal at very reasonable pricing.  Sami made sure to add icing to the cake by delivering two complimentary desserts-a Creme Brulee' masterpiece and Chocolate cake. We were over the moon with happiness!"}
{"text":"...first time there after a casual recommendation from an employee at Talking Stick! my expectations were low for a few reasons: steakhouses in general are not necessarily my thing and the little experience I have going to such is not great: extremely expensive, dark to the point of not being able to read the menu, obnoxiously overpriced wines, average service....overrated, period! Well, Cholla was a great experience! much smaller than expected for a Casino restaurant, good lighting, good greeting, excellent table, friendly service in a professional sense, well prepared food, timely service....unexpected \"freebies\" such as a tiny piece of tenderloin toped with mushroom veloute, various breads including corn bread served in a tiny cast iron hot pan, a \"trou Normand\" of lemon sorbet and last but not least: each a lemon macaron at the end. The silverware and the general table appointments are of good quality, so is the stemware. The wine-by-the-glass is reasonably priced, so was my wife's lemon drop made with Kettle 1! But what impressed us the most, because my wife and I are retired \"starred\" restaurant owners in the Chicago area, is the subtle but efficient cooperation within the staff itself; the main hostess (there was her and a trainee) would regularly walk around and help bus tables, serve a dish, bring a glass of wine etc....so did the other wait person, obviously trained to help around whenever they spotted a need. The bus person was just as pleasant as our waitress, always wearing an honest smile and showing efficiency and knowledge of what they were serving.
Now.....why 4 stars and not 5 after all these positive comments? Don't expect a menu with any \"fancy\" culinary\" accomplishments....no braised veal cheeks or Dover sole here...remember, it is a steak house? yet there were 2 sauces with our Chateaubriand (for 2) and both were not what they could or should have been; the \"demi-glace\" was a commercial one and the \"béarnaise\" was missing the tarragon, more like a hollandaise. The \"sides\" were done right, asparagus, baked potato (baked today!) and gratin potato.
All in all, I highly recommend this restaurant that represents a very good value in the valley, no \"ifs\" or \"buts\"!  Our compliments to the dining room staff and our compliments to the Chef for a meat cooked to perfection as well as \"sides\" treated well (not often the case). I always believed that the staff plays an important part in one's experience, tonight this theory was confirmed, again!"}
{"text":"Once again we went to Cholla for a holiday. Rocky the Mgr, called me right back to firm up our res for 4, even came into the lounge to greet us with her beautiful smile. Elisa did an excellent job waiting on us. Of course once again the food was fabulous, never got a bad meal yet! very consistent. Thx again from Barbra, Ron, Red and Norman."}
{"text":"An unexpected cozy,intimate restaurant inside a casino. The ribeyes we ordered had good flavor but were on the chewy/gristly side; however, the rest of the food, from appetizer to dessert, was excellent, so I didn't really care. The service was SUPERB from all the staff, including the hostess! It was a lovely place to celebrate my hubby's birthday, and he even got a free dessert. Would definitely recommend making reservations."}
{"text":"Came here a few nights ago and was very impressed.  I'm surprised at all the negative reviews as I definitely didn't have the same experience they did.  What I will say is that my co-worker and I both ordered steaks medium-well, and that's why I'm deducting a star.  I got through most of my steak and then it just became medium-rare.  My co-worker had much less luck.  He took a bite which was medium well and then, he too, had a medium rare if not rare cut.

He sent his back and when it came back, he took another bite which was solid and then again, medium-rare.  Not sure how that's even possible, but it was.  A shame.  The food, especially at the price point, should be done with care and this was not.

The desserts were the best I've ever had.. I had the molten lava cake and it was well worth the 20+ minute wait.  The sides that we ordered were also very good, I especially enjoyed the corn that we ordered.  

But honestly, had they not under cooked our entree, it would've be a solid 5.  Don't expect it to be a cheap night.  Our party of 3 had a near $360 bill not including the tip and only one bar drink was done. For the price you pay, you should expect the food to be done right the first time and there isn't any excuse as to why it wasn't done right the second time."}
{"text":"Celebrated our anniversary here over the weekend and were pleasantly surprised. Upscale restaurant feel without the ridiculous pricing. My husband and I both enjoyed their surf and turf special...steak, shrimp, wedge salad and two sides for $29! Great deal and a good amount of food! We ordered the crab and shrimp cocktail for an appetizer and additionally received fresh bread and pesto complimentary while waiting for our salad. To end our meal, we were offered a free dessert (Creme Brûlée) since it was our anniversary. Everything tasted great and also received great service from everyone. Restaurant was smaller than we anticipated but otherwise a lovely evening and we'll be back!"}
{"text":"It was my pre birthday celebration so I felt I was deserving of a nice juicy steak. Upon looking on yelp for one which that was not too far away. I came across the Cholla. I read some good reviews and one of the reviews which stood out the most was the fact that it's not too high priced. When I actually ate there I shortly realized why. I first walked in and wanted to sit at the bar but it was full of smoke which is understandable because it's located inside a casino. So I got a table and since it was almost my bday price was not an issue. I ordered the calamari which was crispy and well spiced but nothing to write home about. I also ordered the seafood bisque which I felt was vastly under seasoned. I even added salt, something I should never have to do to soups. Then I finally ordered the a ribeye which was good but not great but for $20 I can't complain. My real bone to pic ( no pun intended) was with the lobster mashed potatoes which was considered a premium side there because it took the place of two regular sides. This order has me very disappointed because it quickly reminded me of boxed mashed potatoes that were again under seasoned with cheap lobster meat on added to it. It was so pasty I thought I was in grade school again. But overall service was good, with very nice people."}
{"text":"The steakhouse is AMAZING. You get your monies worth. The food here is reasonably priced compared to the high quality meat they serve. 
I've eaten here about 5x and not once have had a bad experience. I always get their filet minion which is cooked to perfection. It's tender and melts in your mouth. I substitute my 2 sides for a premium side, lobster mashed potatoes. Chunks of lobster is buttery mashed potatoes"}
{"text":"SIMPLY FANTASTIC!!! Had a wonderful dinner experience with my family from California. This was our first visit to this restaurant. From the moment we were seated (reservations are highly advised) the service was just terrific and on-point. Ask for Sami who was an incredible kid that worked very hard to serve us! Our food arrived on-time. We didn't order drinks. The elk tenderloin was just INCREDIBLE -- you must try this no matter what!. My wife enjoyed the filet mignon which was cooked to perfection. Sami brought us extra breads (at no charge), extra macaroons (at no charge), a lemon sorbet to clean our pallettes (at no charge), and warm towelettes twice. This place is a FAR BETTER VALUE than other steakhouses that charge a ton of money for essentially the same quality and quantity of meat. We will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Sunday evening birthday celebration, party of 4.
Got there early and had cocktail in the cozy little bar. 
Very accommodating staff seated us, and took orders. A delicious amuse bouche was served, then we started with a cheese and antipasto plate. $10, plenty for 4! Very nice quality. Chilled Bleu cheese wedge salad followed by a sorbet. 
Wife and I had the prime porterhouse for 2.
Superb. Sides were Great, service excellent.
Al in.... great value, top quality. A little known gem of a place. Been here 10 years, could kick my own butt for not coming here sooner.
I hate to lavish too much praise, and spoil it!"}
{"text":"It was my first time here and nothing but amazing!!
Everything was excellent, service, food.
I'm very picky with Bloody Mary and this place did it sooo delicious, way to go!!!"}
{"text":"This place is beyond incredible. I took my wife here for our anniversary, we got 2 amazing steaks! Great price and we will definitely be returning. Yum, yum, yum!"}
{"text":"Incredible! have been many times and there is not a better deal in town! Fabulous food, service, attention to detail."}
