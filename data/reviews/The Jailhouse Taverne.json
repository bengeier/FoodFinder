{"text":"Great food, owners and staff. If your looking for steaks. Not on this menu yet. I am sure they will be soon."}
{"text":"Great food.  All 7 of us were happy with our choices.  Best hummus ever & same for calamari.   Art, our server, was very friendly & knowledgeable and we met the chef, to give him kudos on the food.  He told us about all their plans for Spring and Summer, which includes new seasonal menu, barbecues and concerts.  Really recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch for the first time our food was excellent and the service was even better. We look forward to going back when they're playing live music in the evening"}
{"text":"Very poor service...we were asked to hurry up and order so they can flip tables! So rude! Very poorly ran!!!"}
{"text":"Visited the jailhouse for the first time with my wife. In addition to the music playing way too loud. The note on the menu from the owner basically says he doesn't care he likes the music loud. We were seated but sat there for more than 15 minutes before anyone came over. Everyone working there was having great conversations with themselves and the patrons at the bar but they did not seem to want to take our order or even get us anything to drink. Can't review the food as we left just as the waitress finished her conversation and decided to come to our table. If you like very loud music and poor service this is the place for you. The smell in the parking lot should have been a warning. They may be having some septic system issues. We gave it a try as we have family near by. We will not be returning. Dave yourself the trouble and pick another restaurant/bar"}
{"text":"Always drove by here never stopped glad we did this time had a beer wife had sangria but the food was better wife had French dip sandwich I had black widow burger which had lettuce tomato fried pickles and special spicy sauce .Burger was huge too much food chef owner Jonathan came out and talked to us after meal and said it was one of the smaller burgers jeez I was stuffed he also said they have bands on Thurs. Through Sunday's would go back again. If you follow facebook they have a different burger every month check it out."}
{"text":"A must try in Grafton. Beer selection looked great, BBQ wings were awesome and the staff did an excellent job for it being the first official day open. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Ate there a few weeks ago, with some friends food was ok but jesus can you turn the music down! We were at a table of 6 and were screaming to hear each other. Atmosphere a bust for sure."}
{"text":"ive been wanting to go here since i read the article in the local paper. it was better then i was actually thinking it would be high quality my waitress was amazing and very nice. i got the burger with prime rib it was amazing. it is def out there in the country but that actually makes it even better. i will be back soon."}
{"text":"We have lived all over the United States and travel extensively so eat out ALLOT  and the burger I had today is definetly one of the very BEST burgers I've ever had anywhere.  I had the black & blue burger, My husband had the Tavern burger both were EXCELLENT.  The chili lime fries were awesome as well.  The outdoor deck/patio was great and service was excellent.  Thankfully, we now live close by and will be able to put this place on our regular rotation of favorite area restaurants."}
{"text":"Try as I might I cannot say anything negative about this tavern. Our server was knowledgeable, the menu was unique and the food was very, very good!"}
{"text":"This is a gem in the middle of Gods country. Great atmosphere. Service was exceptional.  Music outdoors so if want to hear band go early. Atmosphere fun and food so good.  Loved the pretzels with the best beer cheese ever. If really hungry try the Last Rights Burger.  Black and Blue salad delicious. This is a must try and for me must return."}
{"text":"A stop while out getting some wind therapy!!! What a great find!! Smoke trout spread was amazing!!! Street corn was perfectly spiced with a hint of lime. The burgers were fantastic....seasoned and juicy! Fried okra was perfection and the fresh cut fries were seasoned! Glad to find a chef who isn't afraid of spices! Well done Chef!!!"}
{"text":"Good food in what seems to be in the middle of nowhere? Yes, Please!  My boyfriend and I were totally wowed on our first experience at Jailhouse by the service, food and atmosphere here. Our waiter was fun and full of energy. He is the type of waiter that you can tell is jazzed about their job and the menu. He told us about his favorite dishes as well as the coveted Gorgonzola sauce that would change our lives.   We decided to order the Pesto Parmesan wings and the special of the night which was Osso Buco Stroganoff. The wings are a good size and the pesto parm flavor is delicious. Where else have you seen this combo? I could not get enough of the Stroganoff. The meat was fall off the bone and packed with flavor. You could easily tell the spaetzle was made from scratch and the fried mushrooms... Oh my gosh...!   Another great feature of this place is they have a huge patio and local bands that play often. We were able to enjoy sitting on the patio and listening to music while we ate. The chef also came out during our meal to ask us about our food and our experience. In my book that's a nice touch and shows he really cares about the food he puts out and the people that eat here."}
{"text":"Really, really good.  My husband heard about it from some guys friends so we drove out to give it a try.  I had the perch dinner and my husband had the filet medallions.  Food is very tasty.  Nice presentation, comfortable atmosphere.  More of a bar scene than restaurant."}
{"text":"Just stopped by while running around on my motorcycle. I've gone past this place many times, and not stopped, but this time I did.  The smell emanating from the place was too good to resist.  It looks like they recently built or rebuilt, so everything is new and clean.    The sound system isn't too loud, but sounds very good. Whoever set it up knew what they were doing, to get the levels just right so that you can hear the music and the person next to you, without shouting.  While I was there it was a steady diet of 80's and 90's hard rock, bands like Aerosmith, Van Halen, Scorpions, etc. Nothing special, not really my thing anymore, but at least it wasn't country, and in a place like this, I would not have been surprised to hear nothing but pop-country.   There's a large deck for outdoor dining and drinking if the weather's nice, and the parking lot is freshly paved and painted and spacious.    It's a bar, but I didn't look at drinks because I never drink when I'm riding my motorcycle.  I stopped for dinner, and was completely blown away by how good the food was.  I ordered fillet mignon medallions, which they have as their most expensive item on the menu for just $20.  I wasn't expect much for that price, but it was superbly prepared, with a demi glace sauce, and a subtle smokey flavor, cooked perfectly, and paired with mushrooms, shallots, potatoes, and asparagus.  I don't even like asparagus, and the asparagus was outstanding.  I ate every bite and probably would have licked the plate clean if I could have.  The staff behind the bar were really nice, took good care of me and were friendly, and just seemed like real people.  For a working class type of place, it's really, really good."}
{"text":"This place is tucked away in the woods, with huge patios from the time you walk up the path to the restaurant and bar, there is a big stage area for live music and I hear this place gets jumping with music at night. The waitress was very nice and answered any questions we had about the food, food was tasty and we tried a lot of things off the menu the chicken wings were nice and crispy the sauce was tangy and delicious. The summer chips also very tasty and crisp. The decor is jailhouse themed and fun, the restaurant was clean and well maintained, all the staff we encountered were helpful and friendly, great experience overall for lunch."}
{"text":"WOW!! Amazing food and an awesome staff. The staff all worked together to make sure everyone was taken care of. Great team work. The food was fantastic, and the beer selection was great. We had the chicken wings and calamari as our appetizer and I don't know which I liked more. They were both prepared perfect with just the right amount of spice and sweet, and the gorgonzola dipping sauce was out of this world! There were so many things I wanted to try. We will be going back for sure!!  Try it out you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Had a great meal l !!!   Our whole family went for dinner (this included my 98 year old mother) and we had a wonderful time and the food was AMAZING !!  My son who is a beer snob loved the variety.."}
{"text":"Pork belly BLT was outstanding, great beer selection.  Wife had Tuna sushi salad was  said, best ever.  I very unexpected fine."}
{"text":"This was my first time here, and I can't wait to go back. I had an OJ Burger that was a special. A half pound burger, marble rye, grilled onions, deep fried jalapeños and an orange BBQ sauce. With American cheese. I subbed cheddar. It came with a big knife and a black glove! Delicious fries. My sis got the French dip and our friend got the Mahi mahi tacos. All were pleased. Great beer selection and drinks. Seriously give this place a try."}
{"text":"7 of us had dinner at Jailhouse. We had prime rib French dip, burgers, and beef medallions. Food was served warm and in timely manner. Meals were flavorful and beef very tender.  Our server was pleasant. Our big complaint was the volume of the music. It was impossible to carry on a conversation at the table. For this reason not sure I will return"}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever had. Waited an hour and a half for a table while another party of 6 that came after us was sat. Asked the reason why this happened and their explanation was that 'family friends of the owners have priority with seating'. What a joke. Ended up leaving and will never be back."}
{"text":"Well, where do I begin? This is our first visit here. First of all, the parking is completely inadequate for the amount of tables they have here. We had to park in a secondary, unpaved lot adjacent to the Taverne. We did get seated right away. We ordered the hummus appetizer which was fantastic! I ordered the Brick Chicken with Bavarian potato salad. The Chicken was a thinly sliced breast, way over cooked and completely unseasoned on a bed of Bavarian \"potato salad\". Nope. Just cubed red potatoes tossed with a bacon vinaigrette, and asparagus. Very underwhelming. Felt like a diet plate. I asked for a side of the vinaigrette to dip the chicken in. It took forever to come to the table and arrived in a small metal cup that was smoking hot. So hot that when I picked it up I dropped it on the table. It burned my fingers. Hubby had the Black N Bleu burger and fries which was good. We will give this place another chance. At some point."}
{"text":"Chili, Last Rites Burger, tavern fries and jalapeño grits were all delicious.  We split and still have a to go box...   and I got blueberries in my bumble berry.  ..."}
{"text":"In the middle of nowhere. Had high hopes as it was recommended. Ordered a burger, medium; It was raw in the center. Fries were really flaccid and greasy. Apparently, the food is only good if the chef/owner is in the kitchen. Clearly, this was his day off.  The service was good, staff attentive, but, probably won't go back. I can get an undercooked burger closer to home."}
{"text":"My friend said this place has the best fried Perch and she was right...it is the best Perch.  The other menu items are creative and he has interesting combos that makes it interesting and unbelievably delicious.  Now I have a place my hubby and I can both enjoy. Keep up the good work, John"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. Everything was exactly on point. I'm a foody and don't write reviews but this joint deserves my praises!!!!"}
{"text":"Went with my family on a Sunday afternoon. Most people were on the outside deck so wasn't too busy inside. All the workers were polite. It was a very clean place. All the food looked amazing. I enjoyed the Alcatraz wings. They were great. I would get them again and definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Great burgers and wings. Lots of delicious selections on the menu. Not typical bar food! Big crowd and a band playing out on the deck. Service was fast and pleasant. It's loud inside but may have been because it was a Friday night. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have not had bad food here yet. Been here maybe 6 times at least . This weekend they seemed to have even gotten better. Nice atmosphere but a little loud so if you're looking for romantic this may not be the place. Service and food great!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious, beer was good too.  We had chicken and jalapeño grits with asparagus.  Burgers and wings are tasty too. I'd go again."}
{"text":"Only a couple of vegetarian options but what I had was excellent.  Husband had chili and meatloaf sliders gave them a 4 on a scale of 1-5. Fresh brewed ice tea and great service too."}
{"text":"First time here. Food was EXCELLENT! Great menu. Lots to choose from. Frances was our server. Ask for her, she's great! She helped us with our selections, and was spot on. We'll be back, for sure!"}
{"text":"Wonderful. Who thought chicken fingers could rock some socks? They were enormous and moist. Along with tasty fries with some zest. The dipping sauces were even altered to be great. The food is a bit pricy. We never leave under 50 bucks. But I guess you get what you pay for.  Establishment is very tidy. Large bathrooms and friendly fast service. I'm not a big fan of paying for both my vodka and my Red Bull most places I go it's 1 price for a drink and i have never paid for my mixer. But all in all the food trumped the drink prices. We will defiantly be going back. We just have to financially plan first"}
{"text":"The place has a great location, we've been there twice. Definitely caters to the biker, rock and roll crowd. The deck is nice but the whole thing is smoking. Cigars, cigarettes you name it someone is smoking it on the deck or on the grounds. We were completely smoked out one trip and asked to be moved inside where the music is cranked up, loud. They tell you this on the menu and make no apologies for it. Just the atmosphere they want.  So if your looking for this scene it's a decent place. The food is okay, both times my burger was horribly undercooked. I don't mind medium rare, I ordered that my first visit and got next to raw. My second visit I was cautious and asked for medium well. They managed to get it to rare. Likewise my wife ordered a steak salad and asked for the steak to be well done. It came out blood rare, she had to send it back. Toppings on burgers are creative, sides are good. If they would learn to properly cook meat they would get another star."}
{"text":"Thank goodness for those around me seeing my kids starving because they lost our ticket in the kitchen. My kids were in tears they were so upset and hungry after their sports. A manager never came to the table,  nor did they question how we got scraps of food from caring folks. I realize that happens but I ordered a salad then and I couldn't even get that. My main complaint is no one acknowledged the table or the crying kids."}
{"text":"Wasn't sure what to expect but all of us were very impressed!  The wings were large, crispy, and meaty; the blue cheese dressing was even outstanding...delicious!  The burger wrap was very flavorful...I wanted more but was stuffed!  I even loved the Caesar salad.  Highly recommend.  We will definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Where the hell did this place come from? Seriously, it's like someone just attached a restaurant to the bottom of a really big helicopter and on their way to Cleveland just looked down upon Grafton and said, \"OK, this is far enough. Let's drop this sumbitch.\" Really, it's like an oasis smack dab in the middle of one of the state's most arid, lifeless food deserts (sorry, Grafton, it's true). The Jailhouse Taverne is some kind of mutant extra-chromosome laden love child that resulted from a night of beer-fueled sweaty ugly rubbin between a rockabilly outdoor music venue and a double-wide trailer already pregnant with a top-notch chef and incredibly skilled staff.  The Jailhouse Taverne is something of a mystery wrapped in a riddle cloaked in an enigma. Is it a live music venue? Is it a blue collar watering hole? Is it a casual restaurant serving up fresh-made, well-executed delicious dishes complete with local ingredients? Well, take all of these, toss 'em in one of those Ninja blenders and crank that thing up. After about a minute you'll be able to pour yourself a tall glass of Jailhouse Taverne.   First, just in case you were wondering, the jail theme is because they happen to be located within a stone's throw of the Grafton correctional facility. A two-minute drive, to be more precise. Yeah, talk about your strange neighbors. Second, the live music thing I mentioned above, they're stacked to the nines with outdoor venue space. Out yonder's an elevated, covered stage with a grassy knoll for lounging and listening. There's even a stream that meanders its way through their backyard. I can't speak from personal experience, but I have a feeling that if this place is a rockin' there will be plenty of knockin'.  The building is right on a corner lot, so parking requires a bit of explanation. There's a main lot on the 57 side, but it's pretty small and fills up quickly, especially on weekends. On the 83 side, they're got much moire space with a gravel lot that has a walkway up to the main building. I recommend parking over there since you can walk by the stage and get a look at everything on your way up.  Speaking of the building, I was impressed by how clean and well-maintained everything was. I don't know why, it just hit me is all. It's clear to me that the owners of Jailhouse take immense pride in their establishment. Once inside the good news continues. It's not a large space, so things can get pretty cozy, but I think that's the point. They want their patrons to mingle. A big bar is the centerpiece with the dining room to both sides. A nice mix of low and high top tables, vaulted ceilings with beautiful pine paneling, and plenty of natural light. It just feels warm and inviting.  I think it's safe to say that this is a bar first. As soon as you walk in you can tell that it's designed for drinking. A wall of colorful liquors beckoning thirsty travelers, a draught tower pouring a dozen beers with a nice selection of crafts and a selection of specialty drinks if that's more your thing. I wasn't blown away by their beer selection, but I managed to content myself with some local suds from Medina's Lagerheads Brewery. They've got a bottled beer list with 4-dozen or so selections, too. Not bad.  Another highlight was the service. I can't remember the last time I walked out of a restaurant blown away by the service. Our server, whose name escapes me, was excellent. A younger chap, his brain was buxom with knowledge. He knew the dishes backwards and forwards, came ready with recommendations, and wore a smile throughout. He checked in a bit too often to see how things were going, but he was so damn good I didn't mind.  Now for the show-stopper. The food. I don't know how they managed to nab a kitchen staff as brilliant as the front of the house, but they did. Forget everything else I've gone on about, the menu is the real star. This is not your dad's bar food. Fresh hummus, burrata with roasted squash, ahi tuna poke, at this is just the appetizer menu. Of course they've got wings and burgers and salads so you can get your greens, too. Then there are the entrees - osso bucco stroganoff, homemade meatloaf with wild mushrooms, and high-class chicken and waffles. I told you.  We wanted to try everything, of course, but we had to save something for our return visit. Some of our personal highlights - the seasonal salad with its maple balsamic, roasted butternut squash and pickled carrots so good it almost shouldn't be called a salad. The tavern meatloaf would make mom rethink her own recipe (although the green beans weren't nearly cooked enough for me), and that cheese fondue and soft pretzels all day, please. Finished off with the perfectly executed creme brulee. Yes, creme brulee. It's only downfall, it needed some fresh fruit.  So there you have it, folks. It's true. There is a place this damn good hidden away in the backwoods of rural Ohio just down the street from a jail. I'm telling you, this stuff writes itself."}
{"text":"Highly recommend trying this place out if you have never been.  I've been a couple times now and the food has always been amazing.  A little pricey, but good food normally costs a bit more.  There can be a wait when it's busy, but thats to be expected.  They have a rotating beer list that has some pretty good brews on it.  I suggest taking the waiter recommendation on what to get, its normally pretty spot on.  I like the Taverne Ribeye personally."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim... and was completely blown away. Not your typical dive bar... food will compete with any top notch restaurant in downtown. Multiple outdoor patios with live music. The head chef came around and talked to our table, was very enthusiastic and talked about upcoming specials. I'm a 45 minute drive from the restaurant, but will definitely be back. Phenomenal food and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Listen to me please.... do NOT listen to any negative naysayers that make even one complaint. \"It's too loud\".. bla, bla, bla... I didn't come here to take a nap or eat bland buffet  food with the seniors before bingo! I came here for great food, and I got it yet Again! We have been here several times, and I will say, it has been fantastic to say the least! Tonight i had a burger topped with prime rib, and to even try and describe it,.. i would simply have to call it meat heaven! The place is clean, fun, well planned and well staffed. Tara was our server tonight, and she couldn't have been better! If you want candles, church quiet, and overpriced chunks of meat served by tuxedo wearing waiters, than you have the wrong place! If you want AMAZING food, come here!!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed it, been three times now, very good overall a touch on the pricey side for upscale bar menu. Only negatives was the wings were just ok. Burger, fish , calamari  were awesome!   Music is too loud, and the septic smell outside was really bad and unappealing. Not bad enough to keep me from returning. Nice spot overall..can't wait to go see a band there!!"}
{"text":"A must see!!!!  Great food, staff, service, environment, and clean!  I was impressed!  The food is Awesome!  I had a Black-n-blue steak salad & my fiancée had a burger,  both were served as ordered and by far the best steak salad I've had in a long time!  This is definitely a spot I will be going out of way for!"}
{"text":"Food and service was fantastic! The wings were crispy and delicious. The cherry cola BBQ sauce was phenomenal. It's a must try! The French dip sandwich was tender and flavorful. They have chili lime fries which were also incredible. The presentation of the food was awesome as well. No complaints here. I highly recommend checking this place out"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food is DELICIOUS the Taverne burger is my favorite, it's so good I rarely order anything different. The steak salad is also really good for a lighter option. Found this place on accident driving by one day, it looks like it would be a lot of fun in the summer with a really nice outdoor patio with lots of trees. It was only a few months ago we discovered this place and we keep coming back! The staff is always super friendly and service is quick. Presentation of the food is top notch, not what I initially expected from a bar/restaurant. Prices are a tad bit on the higher end, but it's quality!"}
{"text":"Simply put- the best fried chicken I've ever had! Boneless and Juicy Plus now I love grits - well their grits. Had to see if it was a fluke, but ended with pumpkin cheesecake was also extraordinarily good.  Highly recommend you visit here."}
{"text":"I feel like I am starting to sound like a broken record but here I go....\"Tried this place based on Yelp reviews...\" Glad I did. My girlfriend and I were sitting at another establishment bored to death and looking for some fun and good grub. This place fit the bill. Great food!!! I went with the bartender's recommendation on pork belly with some kind of maple sauce or something... banging! Also had the calamari which I typically love but this was different and better! Decent beer selection, Touchtunes jukebox, good crowd of mixed ages. The only thing I can think of to try and find a criticism on would be the guy bartender. He never said a single word. Not a smile, not a \"hi\", not a \"can I get you another beer?\", nothing. Still, not anything to really complain about. The woman was fantastic. We will be back!"}
{"text":"If you reading this.. STOP and JUST GO!!! AMAZING! We had the hummus, salmon and the burgers. The food was excellent and the  service was great. We had a chance to meet the chef/owner and he is extremely passionate about food, there is no way you can go wrong eating here!"}
{"text":"Stopped by Sunday 9/11/2016. There is a good amount of screens for sports watching pleasure. They have a good beer selection and the prices are pretty fair. You can't have liquor on Sunday although I am guessing that could be a because they just opened. We split the mahi mahi tacos and the Cubano. I liked the mahi tacos the best. Jodi and Lisa were our bartenders and they were great. They took the time to get to know what beers we liked and made recommendations based on our tastes. I know sometime places start strong and tail off after a while. I hope that doesn't happen here. I feel like this is along the lines of what this area has been missing for a long time. My only complaints were that our fries were a little cold and the seasoning on the mahi mahi was a bit strong. Other than that awesome."}
{"text":"Foods just ok to me..... more hipe then anything !!They won't serve junior stuff to an adult so you waste more food then you want and charge you double! The say they'll substitute and up charge you  but they don't!  I ordered  a side of asparagus and got 4 LITTLE stalks!! For $3.50!!You can't order a medium well steak because the chef says the steaks taste better medium ! Your suppose to please the customer not yourself! Alittle too pricey for what it is! Your paying for the remodel then anything! Bikers still go in there if that's what they were trying to keep out! The beer is really cold though so if your looking for a cold beer it's the place to go!"}
{"text":"Listen. The ambience was great. We've been here a few times and it's been pretty good. The band was awesome. What killed it you ask? Two things. First, I ordered a medium burger. It came looked delicious until I took the first bite and it was cold and just straight ground beef. Like I could scoop it out and make a new burger. No brown, no grill marks. So I waited for our waitress (who was super kind about it) and she took it back. They brought it back and it was maybe warm? Like, I would serve something to my toddler at that temperature. But for something that was \"thrown into the oven\" to be recooked, I would except it to be hot. I ate the ring around it but the center was still jiggly and cold. I can't send it back twice.   Then there was the smell. I don't know if this place was built next to a waste treatment plant or an ancient Indian poo burial ground, but dear god. We were originally on the patio and us and a few other tables had to move inside. It was so bad. Like I'm currently squirting hand sanitizer on my hands and sniffing them because that's the only way to get it out of my nose. And I'm a mom. I can handle poop, vomit, all the mom things.  Overall- ambiance was awesome. I'd come back for a beer. But I don't know that I will eat here again, at least not a burger (how hard is a burger??) and you know, the shit smell."}
{"text":"Great staff, great menu and optional dining al fresco (always a plus in August). Not only do they offer a burger wrapped in lettuce (not bread), but chef prepared it exactly the way I imagined--well done, tender and juicy. It's hard to find that combination anywhere. And blueberries were floating in my Bumbleberry beer...as it should be! Also at our table--street corn, Cajun rubbed wings and hand cut fries--all exceptional!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for late lunch and a cocktails.... calamari was amazing and split black and blue burger with fries.  We will definitely be coming back!!!! Nice bartenders and excellent food..."}
{"text":"good experience all around ...  food ordered Mahi Tacos, Taverne Burger, Burger special..   our kids all had the kids meals..  everything was great except my wife and her friend split the Tavern burger and both did not like that..  the Special Burger was excellent as well as the Mahi tacos..  Fries were great also...   great beer selection and just all around cool place..   will definitely go back to try other selections..  Waitress was excellent also..   don't hesitate to go..."}
{"text":"We went there to watch the game last night .. couldn't wait to have the chicken cordon blu flatbread. Which found out it was off the menu along with the wedge . Then go to order Tito's and cranberry. Guess what they where out of Tito's . So we decided to order an appetizer the okra which I used to really enjoy and it was good but the portion was really small compared to the other times we ordered . Our friends ordered fries so we tried those OMG salty we where joking about them being salt with fries .. we ended up leaving and having dinner somewhere else .. just disappointed.. love the tavern but brought a friend that had never been there before and he doesn't want to return"}
{"text":"We love this place. We've been in a number of times and it's always been a great overall experience. Those of us out and about along the Rt 83 corridor have needed place like this with quality food, a great atmosphere, a friendly wait staff and the smell of country living in the parking lot. Word to the wise -- once the stage gets done in the spring of 2017, Show. Up. Early."}
{"text":"First time here on a tuesday ordered a couple of xmas ales and perch sandwich for myself wife ordered the chicken paprikash sandwich, we were blown away food was awsome will return"}
{"text":"Great burger! High quality ingredients make these burgers a winner. Perfect place to watch the game or hang out on the beautiful patio out back."}
{"text":"This place used to be an old crappy biker bar.  The new owners did an amazing job metamorphosing it.  There is ample parking space, a deck, patio, outdoor stage for live music. The restaurant/bar area is very well designed, with prison related movie posters.  We stopped in for a drink and had the loaded potato chips for a snack (irresistible). They have nice selection of beer on the menu. The menu offers choices from vegetarian to full out carnivore. I talked to the owner who is very friendly.  Try it out!"}
{"text":"Just left our third visit here and I have to say each and every visit has been fantastic. Three different meals, three different servers, three fantastic experiences. On our first visit I had the last rites burger, it was without a doubt the best burger I have had in a long time, a bit messy but insanely delicious. The second visit I had the mahi tacos. They were alright, just a little too bland for me. Last night I tried the cell block chicken and it was perfectly cooked, seasoned with the skin on and moist. Absolutely delicious. We don't tend to eat out very often because we are usually disappointed in our experience, but this place has yet to miss the mark. Jailhouse will continue to be our go to spot for the foreseeable future as we have yet to try everything on the menu nor to be disappointed. The type of music and volume is right up our alley as well!"}
{"text":"Came from Wadsworth, definitely worth the drive.  What a great restaurant.  Food is FRESH, UNIQUE and VERY VERY TASTY!  We ordered the Ruben Eggrolls, Jumbo Wings with Sing Sing Sauce and The Last Rite Burger, so good!  Make the trip!"}
{"text":"Don't judge the book by its cover. Small parking lot near the building, but they have a huge gravel lot about 50 yards behind the restaurant down the hill. Very friendly, helpful and attentive staff. Amazing food. Pretty large beer selection. Outdoor deck and stage are perfect on warm nights!"}
{"text":"Cool place in our little town! It is a little pricy for bar food, but the food is fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Stopped for late lunch with my mom at the Jailhouse Tavern and we both ordered wings. We have eaten there several times and this is the first time I was disappointed. The wings were so undercooked and tasteless (I ordered the honey mustard and my mom ordered the cherry cola bbq flavor) & she had to stop eating them. When she questioned the waitress on whether they deep fry or bake them she was told they deep fry them. We then showed her the inside of a wing that was pink and stringy and said maybe they should cook them a little longer. The waitress just said, \"oh sorry\" and walked away. Definitely not our best experience here."}
{"text":"Was my first time here at the Jailhouse Taverne. I have say was a great experience. The deco is cool and modern. The service was good also to have a full house during the Buckeyes game. I ordered the Cubano Sandwhich and it was good. My only bad experience I had was that I was sit by the garage door in the back, where it covered in flies. Having to keep them off my food and myself was a problem. I would return as long the fly epidemic is taken care of. Sorry for being the first to give a 3 star review but the flies was a big problem. And for a new restaurant/bar that's not good. Other than that the flies everything else was good."}
{"text":"Great wings and fast service. Really expected just bar food, but they have other delicious options."}
{"text":"Just went for dinner. Will return in near feature. Please add crab mac and cheese to every day menu."}
{"text":"We've been to The Jailhouse a few times now and we absolutely love it. The calamari is the best I have ever had. The ingredrients are fresh and the flavors are creative. Yeah, it's loud, but if it's too loud for you, it's not your kinda place.  My husband and I like supporting local businesses and hearing local bands. We get to do both at The Jailhouse. And the service is top-notch. They make you feel like family."}
{"text":"food, service and menu were good and better than just fried  bar food,  but my ears are bleeding from the volume of the music from  blown speakers.  I like to hear good music on a good sound system while dining,  but it doesn't have to hurt."}
{"text":"The food here is very very good- Chef Quality and not at all what you'd expect from a bar/restaurant. The ingredients are all fresh and the entrees are not boring at all-  anything you think you've had before at someplace else this place takes it up a notch.  We've dined here several times and I have never been disappointed.  The black & blue steak salad is amazing, as was the wings my husband recently ordered.  The Gorgonzola dipping sauce is very very good. We've also tried their various burgers and they are also very good- from the meat, to the bun, to the toppings- all perfect!  The place is a little loud so you have to talk loud to hear what the person across from you is saying but to me, that's part of the ambiance of this biker joint/ high quality food establishment!"}
{"text":"What a great place in this rural town. The chef is amazing. Not at all what you expect in the country. We have eaten there a few times and have been happy with everything we had. The outside patio is beautiful. There are live bands on the weekend. We haven't seen any yet but plan on it soon."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the mahi mahi tacos and fried chicken dinners!!! Cold beer too. Great outdoor patio as well. Excellent services. Overall 4 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"I love love LOVE finding places that blow away expectations based on various criteria. For instance, who expects to find culinary creativity executed wonderfully on Rt. 83 in Grafton at the intersection of nowhere and nothing? Yeah, me neither.   So, I only had chicken wings (plain with homemade BBQ and Garlic Pesto on the side, served with veggies and an awesome homemade gorgonzola sauce), but they were done to perfection. My wife got adventurous and got the Meatloaf Sliders (new menu just happened recently so this isn't on the website menu) which were great. They put mashed potatoes and meatloaf on two smaller buns and it was excellent. I'm sure there was more to the dish than this but it's what I remember.  They've got a VERY adventurous menu--fitting of a trained chef not afraid to express himself. And if the rest of the food is as interesting and tasty as what we had last night, we'll be going weekly--and it's a 30 min drive for us, too.   Service was excellent and I have a sense these people LOVE where they work. It shows in how they interact with the crowd. The atmosphere is \"clean country tavern,\" nothing fancy but warm and comfortable. Great juke box with tunes from Sinatra to Five Finger Death Punch (loved their version of Bad Company).They've got a great deck, too, which means we'll be heading here when the weather gets nice again in about 3 years.   If you're looking for prototypical bar food save the gas and go to your closest Winking Lizard or Cleats (both of which do what they do well), but if you want something different, bit more upscale, and unusual enough you'll be telling family and friends about it, give The Jailhouse Tavern a try. It's absolutely different and absolutely fun. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Cold fries and undercooked chicken. Horribly loud inside also. Wouldn't recommend this place to an enemy."}
{"text":"Unbelievable. Chef John took his time to explain the menu, his inspiration, and the specials. Every plate has a lot of thought behind it. 80% of their food is farm to table. This is an atmosphere and a business concept you will want to support. Great selection of regional beers and menu that has sophisticated and filling dishes."}
{"text":"Great restaurant.  I was visiting family and we decided to go here for supper one evening.  Because it was such a nice evening, and reading others' reviews about the noise level inside, we decided to eat outside on the deck.  A very nice setting and relaxing, but still kind of noisy out there, too.  We were about 12' feet from the nearest speaker and still had to really talk loudly to hear each other.  Also, being on a somewhat busy corner, there was a lot of truck and motorcycle noise.  I went inside the restaurant and yes, the music is really quite loud.  Now, onto the food:  because I now live out of state, I wanted to get the Lake Erie perch.  Fried to perfection and nicely seasoned.  The tartar sauce is homemade and about the best I've ever tasted, with a light, lemony flavor.  Their french fries are quite good, too.  Three of the four of us got the perch, the fourth person got a flatbread pizza that she said was quite good.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"What a delightful surprise this joint was. Food was imaginative, upscale and very good. I has the mahi tacos and Caesar salad. Delicious. We also had the smoked trout appetizer which was exceptional."}
{"text":"Finally we have a local eatery worth cheering about. I am not sure whether to share it or keep it a secret so it doesn't get overcrowded!  The food is fantastic, and has a flair that makes it anything but traditional American. The place is busy, and loud, apparently they like that. They are often out of certain Tap offerings which can disappoint. Be aware of the occasional big name acts on stage which turn this eatery into a concert venue with a parking problem and a door charge to match."}
{"text":"We have been going to the Jailhouse quite often for the past two years and have always gotten great food and great service...until today. We were seated and then, literally, ignored for almost 15 minutes. No one said hello, I'll be right with you...NOTHING. After 10 minutes we went up to the hostess and asked if this place was now self serve as no one had been to our table. She said she would have to try and find a waiter. She asked several servers and they all said that was not their table, within our earshot and no one took the initiative to come over to us. We got up and left. We will never be back and we will share our rude experience with everyone we know. We own a food business and we pride ourselves on customer service. Unfortunately, Jailhouse no longer does."}
{"text":"This place is the absolute gem of Grafton! I got the Kell's Southern Fried Chicken and it was OUTSTANDING! I loved the fact that the chicken was boneless rather than a bone-in chicken breast. It was the juiciest, most delicious fried chicken I've ever had. The breading on it was my favorite part. The jalapeno corn grits and asparagus were delicious pairings to this dish. Unfortunately it was raining cats and dogs when we went, but I can't wait to go back and enjoy the live music outside. The remodel on this place is excellent, and the outdoor area is so nice. I plan to become a regular, thanks for the great experience!"}
{"text":"This place always had my interest as I'd drive by it, glad I finally get to review this restaurant. The atmosphere is very lively and energetic, they have an awesome looking patio and they have bands play with a full stage. The beer selection was above average and offers a variety of tap handles of good craft beer and also bottles of craft beer. The menu is fun and adds a jail twist to the names of items and the food was awesome, huge juicy burgers cooked to perfection. I highly recommend this restaurant if you want something fun and a good night out."}
{"text":"Newly opened. Mike Roth and John Taylor you have done a great job.  Many items you will not find anywhere else.  You need to come and try the Jailhouse."}
{"text":"Four of us had a late lunch on. Beautiful Sunday recently. The deck is great and staff very friendly.   Food was delicious and fresh. I had the mahi tacos and they were a little spicy but an excellent choice. My husband's burger looked good and he said the bun tasted homemade. Would love to try several other things on the menu. The fries were homemade.   My only complaint is that it is loud, even outside as there are speakers everywhere and the volume is definitely amped up."}
