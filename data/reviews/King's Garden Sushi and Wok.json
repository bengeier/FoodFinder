{"text":"It is the best sushi in town by far!!! If you can find sushi that is fresher, and better tasting for the price. Call me 647-466-9673. I ensure every time you eat there it's good as the last time!"}
{"text":"This was a delicious treat.  We may have found a new favorite sushi place in Scarborough!"}
{"text":"This is another mini-mall place that we passed several times before we tried it... and I wish we'd just kept passing by.  Although there are definitely gems to be had in Scar-beria mini-malls, this isn't one of them! We did go on a recommendation, and it does have a few highlights. Sushi and Wok - as you'll see it on the sign - has a nice interior and the tempura was good! The sushi itself was serviceable, with fresh fish on delicate rice... but completely overpriced for the quality and quanitity. However, the salmon roll was tiny. The rainbow roll was practically a cucumber roll. And the seafood udon was incredibly bland. Like, possibly broth poured out of a box kind of bland! Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"This was my first time ordering food from here and it did hit the spot, I was just a bit disappointed by what they give you for your money. The chicken fried rice was good,  but I could of made it myself. Wasn't like the chicken fried rice I usually buy. I dont know if I would come here again."}
{"text":"I visit this place often since it's pretty close to where I live :) Their spicy crab roll and avocado rolls are awesome! A bit pricy though, but they are all really sweet and nice :) I tried a few other dishes, but didn't like them that much D: but their sushi is really great!"}
{"text":"My fav is their Gyoza appetizer and incredible chicken don, inexpensive authentic sushi dishes, cozy eat in or fast take out, check it out!!"}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite places in Scarborough to eat. Great food, prices nd people! Love Sushi and Wok  m"}
{"text":"Good sushi and the prices were very fair for lunch.  We also got a 60 piece tray for a party, which went over very well.  I'm happy to recommend this place."}
{"text":"They have, BY FAR, the best Sushi I have had in Toronto. Their Shanghai noodles are amazing, they have a sweet taste to them, and come with bbq pork and shrimp as well aa cabbage and some other veggies. Their gyoza dumplings are also the best ai have ever had. They seem to be steamed and then dropped in the wok to give it a fried crunchy outer layer.. the meat inside the dumplings are seasoned perfectly and from what we heard, are home made... we also ordered dynamite rolls, dragon rolls, and california rolls, 18 pieces in total.. their rolls are probably double or triple the size that you would find at a typical sushi restaurant.  Everything is crazy fresh...  I would seriously advise you to try this place.."}
{"text":"I really enjoy sushi especially when it's done well and fresh. The sushi here is very nice, definitely taste fresh, but then again I saw them make it.   I really like the fact that they had all my favorite type of sushi. To often do I go to a place and they don't have what I like. The atmosphere is very Japanese very fung shui. The Flat Screen in the wall is a nice touch.   I would definitely recommend this place, for an evening out or just a quick lunch. Plus is a healthy choice; how can you go wrong."}
{"text":"?? ?? ????? ?????? I would definitely recommend this restaurant, good at Japanese food and Chinese food."}
{"text":"I've ordered sushi and sashimi from this restaurant dozens of times and I can tell you their food is very good. I highly recommend their party trays and sashimi. Their salmon, tuna and butter fish sashimi are flat out excellent! I like my sashimi cut thick and served slightly chilled and that's how they do it. At a temperature where you can actually taste the fish! The quality of their fish is very consistent. Actually, I'm amazed at just how consistent it is. The flavour and texture is second only to Le Cafe Michi if we're talking Scarborough sushi joints (granted, I've never eaten at Zen). Yes, their selections are a bit more expensive then say Niji or Gumi which I also frequent, but for the quality, it 's definitely worth it. And we're only talking a few bucks here. They also have speedy delivery as well - free for orders over $30. My only gripe, you need to tell them you want chopsticks. If you don't, your order may not come with them. Happened to me once but never since then. Overall, a very good spot for some great quality sushi!"}
{"text":"This would be more of a 2.5 star rating. Disappointing rainbow roll. It only had cucumber and avocado inside.  Typical rainbow rolls I've had were  California rolls with fish on top.  The roll tasted bland without the fish eggs and \"crab meat\" inside."}
