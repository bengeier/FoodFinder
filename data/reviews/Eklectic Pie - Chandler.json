{"text":"I was a bit underwhelmed after trying this place for the first time.  The crust was a bit thin for my liking and the only regular soda they serve is Pepsi and diet Pepsi.  They have a good selection of toppings including pulled pork which I haven't seen at competing locations.  The vinegarette salad dressing was way too thick.  For my money I like mod pizza better and the pizza was more filling."}
{"text":"their food is really good but i missed eating here twice now because the hours are wrong. this is so stupid lol fix your yelp page because now i have to starve AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Build your own pizza with as many toppings as you want, for the same price! I like the jalape√±o lime sauce and the pesto. So good! And everything is made from scratch. You can totally taste the difference."}
{"text":"We had the gluten free pizza. Though a fun place, we didn't feel the same about the pizza."}
{"text":"Our 1st visit and we will definitely return!  Friendly, attentive staff, clean restaurant, and DELICIOUS pizza!  We had a minor issue with our son's order, the manager immediately corrected it & gave our son a water bottle to take home.  Top notch experience! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I went to try out the new place on Feb 4th.  I have been to MOD in San Tan a lot because it is so close to home.  I found the sauce to be outstanding and like it much better than MOD.  The crust was a bit better as well.   The pizza was out within 5 minutes and overall it was awesome."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying that the pizza is amazing.... I mean you basically make it yourself so if you don't like it; it's pretty much your fault.   Butttt the staff is very frustrating to deal with. I didn't know it was possible to screw up a pizza you made yourself. They proved me wrong. When they bring your pizza out its like a bad magic trick. Is this your pizza? No. Is this your pizza? Nope.   The two steps to it takes to pay for your pizza is very confusing not just for the customer but for the staff as well.   This is the second time my family has been there, hoping that the first time, was just a rough day for the staff. Nope. They're still extremely slow at just about everything. We're hoping this is a growing pain. But for now we'll be going to Mod Pizza or Fired Pie."}
{"text":"I have to say the eklectic pie is the best the service was amazing and Savanah was great she went and roasted red peppers for my pizza and the price is great.  Recommend the pesto chicken"}
{"text":"The Chandler location on Germann Rocks! The staff is always nice and the food is great for the price! I love dinning with deals and right now Mon - Wed from 4pm - close they offer any 11\" pizza, that's right pile on as many toppings as you like, for only $5!"}
{"text":"Good food that is convenient seeing as it's right next to Harkins! Can get busy on the weekends but pizza is always out super fast!"}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever been to a pizza place where they offered non-dairy cheese! So excited! I don't eat anything with tortured animals so to see there was actually an option for me was awesome! (Don't worry, people who like torturing animals, they still have meat and dairy.) The toppings are delicious and the crust is beautifully thin. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"The pizza here is absolutley amazing! You can make your own pizza with almost any topping on it. The meatball crumble and fresh motzerella are just a few of their best toppings. Their salads are very tasty as well. They have a very good selection of drinks to chose from as well, but not as many as some other places do. The sugar cane sodas do make up for that however. Unfortunately the desserts are not up to par. We tried the cookie dessert and it was hard as a rock and about two chocolate chips within the entire \"cookie\". We tapped it against the pan and it didnt even put a dent in it, completley unedible!"}
{"text":"Where do I begin??? This is THE BEST pizza we have had in a LONG time!!! My favorite was the Besto Pesto and I got some leery looks from my family when it got to the table because they're pretty picky. Even my 7 year old daughter LOVED it!!! My own homemade pie got bumped down the list with my family of pizza snobs, but I'm okay with that lol. Needless to say, they demolished all of the pizzas we ordered. Their prices are awesome and it allows you to order a few different kinds so everyone can try. Being a native NYer, it is hard to find someone who can do thin crust so well  (it's their traditional but it's perfectly thin for a fanatic like me). The fact that you can get as many toppings as you'd like for no additional charge gets a thumbs up from me. Most of my life has been spent working in the restaurant industry, so I'm picky about the cleanliness of establishments. This place is clean, well run all with a funky, eclectic  flair. We were greeted by friendly, smiling and bubbly staff who were very patient with us first timers giving us suggestions, etc. You can tell it's genuinely part of the culture there. Five stars isn't enough to describe our experience. I HIGHLY recommend you go there and grab a pie SOON!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a bit overpriced and definitely overrated. Yes, it is cool how you can build your own pizza, but it's just not that good. At least not the pizza with the gluten-free crust. The crust is so thin - it's chip thin. I do enjoy thin crust pizza, but this is easily the smallest thinnest pizza I have ever had.   The pizza I ordered was supposed to be around 12-13 inches but the one I received was 8\".  I ordered my pizza online and went to pick it up, and I was so thrilled with all the toppings I selected and envisioned this great pizza with piles of toppings, but when I got home and opened the box, I saw my tiny 8\" pizza with barely anything on top.   Needless to say, I was very disappointed and will not be returning. I can get a way better pizza that is the size it is supposed to be with plenty of toppings for a couple bucks cheaper elsewhere. It's too bad it didn't work out because it's so close to where I live."}
{"text":"Good pizza at a reasonable price. I usually come in for the lunch special and have been quite happy with it as I work close by. Today I came in 2 minutes after the end of their 2:00 lunch special, and the girls behind the counter would not honor the special for me. Not their fault, as they were just following the rules and told me that the computer wouldn't allow them to ring in the special price. Really not the biggest deal in the world, but I dislike feeling like the customer doesn't matter and the rules are more important, especially over something as trivial as being 2 minutes late. This cost them a customer today, and maybe in the future as well."}
{"text":"Love their drinks and pizza!! Very unique and tastes amazing. I got their loaded potato pizza and tried several different drinks-- all great"}
{"text":"Okay, let's get something straight right off the bat. This is NOT \"Pizza.\" Calling these oversized canapes \"pizza\" is like calling Pringles potato snacks a \"potato chip.\" They are made on CRACKER dough and they taste like water biscuits. It's a tasty enough snack that gets served up pretty fast and cheap, but calling it pizza is a misnomer."}
{"text":"The pizza was alright, but not something I'd return a second time for because the middle of the pizza was soggy while the outsides were crispy. I do prefer a thin crust pizza, but this one just wasn't well executed.  I was quite shocked that someone allowed the cookie that I ordered to be boxed up and given to a customer. It was burned and rock hard."}
{"text":"Loved it and so close to home!  Kids were a bit overwhelmed but loved it as well.  I like that they had such great choices of beer and wine.  Atmosphere, service and prices were great as well!!  We will be back.!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever had amazing service highly recommended, chef was fantastic. I'll be back for sure and will recommend to everyone"}
{"text":"Very very very good pizza. Fresh. Cheaper than MOD, which isn't actually fresh ingredients. You can definitely taste the difference! Very friendly employees. Very clean bathrooms and environment. I go to CG, and this will definitely be our new spot!"}
{"text":"Delivery is hard to write a review about but i was pleasantly surprised that the thin crust pizza remained mostly crusty on the bottom.  The ingredients were good.  The parm sticks were a nice treat, pizza sought rolled up and flavored.  Crispy on the outside, soft in the middle and well flavored.  Note: smores pie did not do well upon delivery, probably better in the restaraunt."}
{"text":"We had a most wonderful visit and meal at Eklectic Pie!  I can say nothing bad - only good!  I love the concept of having whatever you want on your pizza - and all within about 5 minutes.  Not only that, but the ingredients are all of highest quality.  We drank beer, too, which was awesome as well.  A bit pricey on the beer, but there are some nights where it is cheaper I think.  Our whole family loved this place, so I guess it is on our list of best pizza places around Chandler/Gilbert/Queen Creek - e.g. Sal's Gilbert Pizza, Buddyz Pizza, Jet's Pizza, and now Eklectic Pie.  So many great choices!"}
{"text":"This place is way better than any of the other build-your-own pizza places. They're sauces are unique and flavorful and all of the ingredients are fresh and good quality. And on top of it all, it's so cool inside! Our most frequent go-to date night place :) Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Build your own pizza on baseball trivia night. We wore baseball gear and had $5 pizzas, $2 beers (draft, can or bottle) and free dessert. It was good fun and the owner or general manager was friendly and fabulous. We received Eklectic goodies like frisbies, water bottle and yo-yo for correct answers.   As always, the drink selection was great with cane colas and a variety of beers and teas. Love how random my pizza always ends up with yummy and fresh toppings. Both of our pizzas were a tad undercooked and soggy (not doughy but not crispy, either). It all tasted good and the service was great. It is literally next to the Harkins on Gilbert/Germann. We love the Mesa location but will more likely frequent this one due to location."}
{"text":"First time eating here and I am not impressed. Pizza was overdone and therefor dry. There was a big air bubble that took over about 1/3 of my pie. As a result there were no toppings on that portion. I ordered the 8\" besto pesto. The flavor was good and I would hav given 4 stars had it been cooked properly. It wasnt busy but it seemed to take long. I am guessing because it was in the oven too long. I dont like my pizza crust to have a lot of black. I ordered mine to go. Noticed at leastvone dirty table while I waited."}
{"text":"Always amazing pizza and service! We take our family here on a fairly regular basis, the food is great and the kids love \"making\" their own pizza.   Stopped by this afternoon with my husband. I asked for cilantro and very innocently received basil - which I happen to be allergic to. Of course I didn't notice until I ate two pieces (yikes!). The staff was great and remade my pizza for me at no charge, they even refunded the cost of my pizza. It's not a life threatening allergy, and I made that very clear, but they jumped on the opportunity to make it right. I knew I loved this place for a reason!"}
{"text":"While their prices are a little high (c'mon, regular price for kid's drinks? Gimme a break) their pizza is delicious.   I wouldn't say you get it fast, but it's not slow either. And I really like the creativity they show with their ingredients. It's all fresh, and made in front of you.   The salads are great, the  pizza is top notch and it's right next to the movie theater so you can just hop on over there after your amazing pizza experience here. Perfect."}
{"text":"We gave this place a shot and were not disappointed. It has a festive atmosphere, is clean and the food was worth it. The service was excellent and the prices were fair. It is similar to MOD Pizza and they even have local micro brews on tap. This location is prime; it's right next to a movie theater and a Cold Stone Creamery.  I would recommend this restaurant to my family and friends!"}
{"text":"Nice staff, product appeared thin.  Not a place for our family."}
{"text":"This is on the top of the list for the personal pizza places that are sprouting up everywhere.  I like this one best because of the sauce taste, the quality of the dough and overall quality of final product.  The topping choices are very good but missing a few common options other places have.  This has been out go to place when we have a movie night since its next door.  Recommend you try this place."}
{"text":"Ordered online, 10 custom pizzas!  Ready before time asked for, awesome job!  The young lady at the counter even helped me carry them out to the car, talk about great customer service!  Will definitely be back.  Thank you so much Ekletic Pie!  We Love you.  From your friends at Chandler Gilbert community college social and behavioral sciences division."}
{"text":"The reason why this review is a 2 and not a 1 is because I have ordered food online here before and the food was okay for the price.  My last experience here was horrible!  I walk in and there are 2 employees behind the counter.  One is behind the register and the other is doing something with the toppings.  I wait for a little bit, the girl doing the toppings finally looked my way and here expression was like \"What the F**k are you doing here?\" and she goes back to her toppings.  I look at the door to see the hours of operations and then at my phone.  They are open for another hour.  Then another customer walks in and I guess the employees can't ignore the both of us.  I order a side Cesar and the large Loaded Potato Pizza.  Big sigh from the employee because they don't have the larger size pressed and she has to get an employee to press one for me (and subsequently the guests behind me).  I go to check out and she has forgotten my salad but my gut says don't even mention that.  I pay for my drink and pizza and she start complaining to me that people are coming is and she is suppose to be off.  Awkward!!  I get my drink and try to find a clean table.  As I'm waiting for my pizza a notice a puddle of cola growing from under my glass.  I pick up the glass and there is a steady drip from a hole in the bottom of the glass.  I try to get the employees attention but they are too busy talking to one another.  So I go to the counter with my drink dripping all over the place.  Still can't be bothered to help me.  So I leave the glass with the hole on the counter.  My pizza comes and it's not good.  It's soggy in the middle and all the toppings just slide off.  I ate what I could.  When I left the oozing glass was still on the counter in front of the register with the puddle just getting bigger."}
{"text":"Perfect for a quick bite before the movie, but also good specialty pizzas. Everyone loved the thin crust, and the price was right with a excellent special tonight. The staff was friendly & the manager even came by with baseball trivia and giveaways for the kids."}
{"text":"Not impressed. First of all you have to stand in line to order like you're at Subway. Then the on tap beer was flat. The patio seating is uncomfortable and wobbly. We ordered the \"Wine Country\" pizza and it was not good. They brought the dessert pizza at the same time as the regular pizza so it was cold and soggy by the time we ate it. We won't be back."}
{"text":"eklectic is hot fast, and fresh!! Fast, fresh, great experience! You can't go wrong! I come here often and everyone I get somethings different! The staff and very friendly and really attentive. The pizza taste so fresh and the atmosphere is chill/laid-back, very welcoming."}
{"text":"First time visiting.  Excellent!!  Fresh toppings sourced locally. I created my own and they had Carmalized onions and green olives (which is hard to find at most customize type pizza places).   In my opinion this place blows MOD out of the water! Great job and I will come back soon."}
{"text":"I've tried a lot of gluten free pizza crusts- this one is really tasty! I've always enjoyed a thinner crust and this satisfies without feeling heavy. Perfect!! Can't wait to go back and build another pizza."}
{"text":"I can hop over from the office, grab food and be back within 30 min.  Or order online and be back to my desk in 15 min.  They are that fast, friendly and fresh.  Now my whole office goes there, often!  I love the fact that I can get a made to order salad.  So many places have salads but I say, not with onions not with stinky cheese, not with peppers, and then I have a salad with one or two ingredients but have to pay full price.  I get a salad exactly how I like it.   Love this place!"}
{"text":"Awesome prices, pizza and service. New favorite pizza place. They use real ingredients and give back to the community. No reason not to go here!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! I love this place. Best Caesar dressing. Best Gluten free pizza. Fresh made. Amazing!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Food and fantastic employees. Everyone who works here seems genuine and kind, and they're always happy to help. There was a guy there when I went once, I think his name was Justin but I'm not 100% sure, super cool guy and makes a great pizza. I just told him to surprise me, and he read my mind, because it was exactly what I wanted. They make wings and sandwiches as well, and they're just as good as the pizza! If anyone says something negative about this place, they're lying because it's great! I would give a 6th star but I cant!"}
{"text":"I recently ordered the football special online where it is 20 dollars for wings, skins and 2 pizzas.  I placed  the order on the website and apparently it did not take in the store.  I arrived and had to deal with store manager Isaac.  He stated that the ONLY way he could serve me was through ordering online.  I sat at the end of the line and pulled up the website on my phone but it would not allow me to complete my order as my phone sucks.  He just stared at me and said there was nothing he could do.  How about just letting me order pizzas?!   I will not be coming back..."}
{"text":"My husband and I were dropping our teenager off for a movie and thought we'd stop in for lunch. I liked the way their menu is set up. You get a choice between two sizes 7 or 11 in. You can pick one of their signature pizzas or build your own with a variety of toppings. We agreed on the white wedding 11 in. My husband likes thicker crusts so we paid the extra money for a double crust pizza. We also ordered one of their cookies and two drinks.   Upon receiving our pizza we were disappointed on how thin the double crust was. Really? It was like a regular thin crust you'd get at any other pizza place. If that is their thick crust I'd hate to see what their regular crust is like. The taste of the pizza was ok. Nothing I'll be craving and begging my husband to go back for. But a place I'd go to again if we happen to just be in the area.  After finishing the pizza we tried our big cookie. It was nothing special and actually a waste of the three dollars and something we spent on it. It was so thin and over cooked. It just broke into pieces when we tried to pick it up. We later offered it to our teenager since most teenagers will eat anything. She didn't eat it...  I will say we enjoyed the atmosphere. They really did a good job with the decor and theme they were going for. That was our favorite part. Because of that, good service and average pizza this place is a strong three stars."}
{"text":"Each time I visit I am always served quickly and the food is always yummy. The staff is really friendly and they definately know what they are doing.  Compared to other make-your-own pizza places, this one is my favorite."}
{"text":"Abundant goodness: Fresh pizza ingredients, pepperoni that really is peppery, artichokes that are tender, cheeses that are flavorful, and on and on. And, the price for an 11\" pizza is less than ten bucks. My wife and I will stop here whenever we're out to a movie at Harkin (NW Corner Germann & Gilbert) or shopping at San Tan Village. Thank you \"Check Please Arizona\" for directing us to this fine pizzeria!"}
{"text":"Love the pizza, variations on the Wine Country my personal favorite. Nice people working there. It's our family's #1 spot for pizza. Sadly, got an email today saying they are going out of business, last day is Wednesday 11/1. Gonna miss them."}
{"text":"Customer service is the reason for a 1 star. Pizza itself was about a 3-4 . Taste was very good but it was not cooked long enough and every topping fell off when you attempted to get a slice. FIrst visit today and unfortunately the last. I had received an email for a free dessert and when i asked for it today while picking up my pizza , the girl said i had to use at my next visit??? I had the email in hand although she didn't even look at it  so how she came to that conclusion is beyond me. I explained to her that the coupon expired in 14 days and there was nothing in my email that said i had to come on a specific day to use my coupon for my free dessert. Losing a customer over a $2.99 dessert because of your refusal to honor a coupon YOU sent to my email is not a good first impression when promoting a new business."}
{"text":"My beef:  blue cheese dressing is too runny, garbage can is frustrating, decor is a strange mix of tile, two conflicting metals, wood table tops, and Edison bulbs.  Pizza is fine.  No diff than Mod or Pieology.  Prices seem a tad high, maybe because it's by the theaters."}
{"text":"We decided to try Eklectic Pie because I thought I had a birthday coupon.  Turns out it was to Pieology.  Our pizzas were okay, but very greasy.  My husband tried half the loaded potato and half meaty Italian.  I had the besto pesto pizza.  Mine was cooked crispier than his.  His was soggy in the middle. We took leftovers home.  My husband has been sick with food poisoning symptoms all day.  I have an upset stomach, but not nearly as bad as him.  That is enough for us to NEVER return.  The leftovers went in the trash.  We will stick to MOD.  They're pizza is fresher, the staff is much nicer & their pizzas are cheaper.  *Side note after reading some other reviews.  We also noticed many dirty tables that were not cleaned while we were there. We should have taken that as a sign.   It was not busy on a Friday night."}
{"text":"The bbq pizza with bacon, pulled pork and onions is my favorite. The managers are always very nice and sometimes bring dough balls for my toddler to play with during dinner. Love their unique sodas as well."}
{"text":"Over priced for greasy soggy pizza. The crust was great as long as no sauce or topping touched it. Over $9 after taxes for a undersized 11' pizza. Ordered the fruity pie tuttie not a single piece of apple to be found. Apple pie sauce drowned in crumbles of sugary topping. No cinnamon taste. Wasted money on pricey crap. They won't last 3 years. They need to go back home and stick to ripping off their family. Its perfect for the fake people that think looks are all that matter. No substance or quality to be found here."}
{"text":"Interesting..... It's a fired pie knock off. Cool thing is they have 2 different size pies available and they have a couple dessert pies too. Customer service was good, pricing seams reasonable and the pies were ok. Nothing really reached out at me other than the cool laminated playing cards for table delivery. I'll drop in again I'm sure but so far nothing says POW."}
{"text":"this restaurant is careless. i ordered a gluten-free crust, vegan cheese pizza, and the young lady who made it specifically asked me if i had allergies. i said yes and that they were severe. she changed her gloves, ensuring me all would be fine. foolishly, i ate the pizza.  got home and had one of the worst migraines in my life that made me throw up over 13 times overnight. obviously, the ingredients were not as promised. i couldn't find a ride to the hospital, so i had to suffer severe dehydration and pain.  i phoned today and spoke with the general manager about the problem. he was inconsiderate, to be kind. he offered me a free pizza were i to return, an offer i told him i would never trust. then he said i could come back with my receipt for a refund. when i told him i lived in scottsdale and the drive was too far, asking him to refund me over the phone, he said that was impossible.  this is one bullshite operation. i'm taking this to a higher source.  UPDATE: my friend came over last night and took a bite of my leftover pizza. she confirmed that it had BOTH mozzarella AND Parmesan cheeses on it. why would someone put two kinds of cheese on a pizza after someone tells her that person she has a deathly allergy to dairy?  meanwhile, the Director of Operations contacted me this morning and offered to send me a CASH REFUND THROUGH THE MAIL. obviously, the company wants no paper trail of the incident. shady.  AVOID THIS PLACE! IT'S HIDING THINGS FROM THE PUBLIC, TRYING TO MAINTAIN A HIGH REPUTATION IT DOES NOT DESERVE."}
{"text":"Very clean , very good pizza , very easy to order , owner was there on site , 5 minutes for a pizza made to order , must try for sure , you will not regret it"}
{"text":"I thought the food tasted great, the service was good too! Then I got home and 2 hours later I was puking non stop until 3 am the next day. Food Poisoning at it's finest. I got the Italian ciabatta..maybe just ask how fresh their ingredients are so you dont have to experience food poisoning and missing work the following day."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Create your own personal pizza. Even my 4 year old ate the whole thing which is a huge compliment!"}
{"text":"This is my first time going and I have to say the customer service from beginning to the end was fantastic. The staff was very helpful and energetic. Alright, the food was great as well! We will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"If you are tried of the same regular pizza joints and looking for a change !?!   This is the place to then    Quick ~ testy and very light   Hands down 5 *"}
{"text":"First experience was good. It was an hour before closing but the staff was friendly. The food didn't come in 5 minutes as advertised-but it was alright. Food was good.   The Second time I walked in, there were three girls and a manager behind the counter-No greetings or smiles were offered,  just disinterested expressions. I ordered an 11\" pizza and a dessert pie, and tipped over 20%- I'm dumb. I sat down facing all of them, just observing. A group of guys came in and suddenly the girls were super friendly and willing to do their jobs. Patiently, I waited as people behind me got their food right away. I felt bad for the cook as he was the only BOH person, while 4 people just stood around FOH. After 20 minutes of waiting, my food came, and I wanted to kick myself in the face for not asking for my money back. Did I fail to mention seeing the cook tear open the seal of a bottled condiment with his bare teeth? Yeah.   How was the food, you ask?   The chicken was overcooked, the mushrooms were stacked on one side, the basil was in a big cluster, the pesto was all over the edge crust, and the crust overdone to crisp but managed to become soggy as hell.   Summary?   Don't do it. Unless you're a teenaged boy, cause then you'd get them to do their jobs. It's sad because this place is in a good location, it has an interesting name, and the inside is nice. Wish they'd stop hiring people who lack initiative, or don't care for their jobs, and start hiring people who'd work everyday like they've got something to prove."}
{"text":"I take everyone to this place. I've met my boss here for a casual business meeting and have brought the whole family. There's something for everyone! Pizza is a thin crust pizza, made-to-order. My favorite pizza is the Cowboy BBQ (bacon,BBQ sauce, red onions, cheese, pulled pork...)"}
{"text":"I've got a new favorite restaurant. All u want toppings. No extra charge.  See my pic. Yup I did it!"}
{"text":"There seems to be a lot of these fast food type of pizza places popping up everywhere lately but this one seems to be the favorite of our kids.  Pretty much the same deal as the other places.  You can choose to build your own or select one of the pizza's they have already created.  In addition to pizza's, they offer ciabatta sandwiches, wings, and alcohol for the adults...woohoo!!!  I have tried the Sicilian and the Chicken Pesto toasted ciabatta's.  Both have been awesome.  As far as pizza's, the kids love the Meaty Italiano and the Flame Thrower.  The Meaty Italiano is pretty much how it sounds.  Cheese topped with pepperoni, Italian sausage, salami, and meatballs.  The Flame Thrower is a different story.  Think of Buffalo wings on a pizza, but with crispy crust.  I love it.  As far as price, it seems a little higher than the hut, papa's, and dominoes.  It helps that it is near the theatre and other shops.  The place is clean with a little hip vibe and the staff is always helpful and friendly.  I recommend this place if you want to try something different from the major pizza makers.  Everything we have tasted here have been tasty and the serving sizes are just right.  Also make sure you get an order of the Cheese Bread Stix."}
{"text":"Adorable place! Came here on Saturday and it was pretty busy but the wait wasn't long. There are two sizes (7\" or 11\") and they come out fairly quick! My sister's boyfriend ordered the Loaded Potato Skin (SO GOOD) and we ordered the Besto Pesto with no feta and replaced it with pepperoni. We added bell peppers and red onions for a twist and it has so much flavor and it was amazing. The prices are $5.99 for the 7\" and 11\" is about $8.69 and has unlimited topping choices! The 7\" is good for one person though. Definitely coming back, this place is great."}
{"text":"Employees are nice and the food is really yummy. I had the wine country pizza. Also, they are fast at preparing the food. So glad I discovered this place!"}
{"text":"Great thin pizza made the way you like it with the oven baked taste.  So glad to have this place close by and encourage others to try it.  I love the Meaty Italian with olive oil no sauce and shredded parmesan. 7 inch will run you $6 and an 11 inch about $9. The service is fast and drinks are refillable.  It's an order and sit style place but they bring your food to you.  If you love thin baked pizza you've got to try this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Usually I'm forgiving when a first time visitor, but....  - Ran out of wings on wing night - Waited 20 minutes for my cheese pizza as I watched them put it in the to-go hot oven and got confused why I was staring at them - Didn't get an apology - Pretty disorganized overall on a Wednesday night, imagine the weekend  Def not going back since Fired Pie and Mod Pizza at least have their shit together."}
{"text":"This place was just average to me. I like that they offer a 7 inch & an 11 inch pizza with unlimited toppings, but there are places (with the same concept) that are better in the area. Such as Fired Pie, Pieology, and my favorite...MOD Pizza. They only had sliced sausage and not crumbled sausage...and they didn't have pepperoncini peppers as a topping.  However, the customer service was pretty decent and parking was easy."}
{"text":"Quality ingredients and fast service! My new pizza spot in town!"}
{"text":"After watching a movie next door, the 4 of us dined her for a late lunch. We ordered side salads and entree salads. I asked the girl to put together an entree salad but she didn't hear me so we got one at the very end.  The salads were very full and we liked the cilantro lime dressing. I got the 7 in margherita pizza - it was very thing just the way i like it but no basil. The basil was very sparse and didn't have that flavor I liked. My guy ordered a chicken Italian one and it was very average. Our friends ordered a half and half 11 in pizza and they built it their own way. We all ate our pizzas it just wasn't spectacular. Our lunch bill was ~$23, thinking can go somewhere else for higher quality of food and flavor."}
{"text":"Sad to hear that they are going out of business on November 1st.   We love their rewards program and the Birthday pizza freebie! My parents and I visit often and will be sad to see it close.   Thank you to the great staff that made this place rock! Never had a bad experience, only good things to say.  Wishing all of your staff good luck on their future endeavors."}
{"text":"I'm not even a huge pizza fan (but married to one) and I love this place. For a low price we can order exactly what toppings we want and you don't get charged per topping! I love it. The salads are huge. The sodas are pure cane sugar. Not my fav.  But they have yummy teas. Service has always been great and the employees are always nice."}
{"text":"Good pizza.  Crust was very thin, so if you are not in to that then this won't work for you.  I had the 7 inch pizza with caramelized onions, garlic, and extra marinara sauce.  The line was efficient.  Good customer service.  I was happy with my pizza.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"The only thing good about this place is its proximity to the Harkins Theater. The pizza is terrible compared to Mod Pizza and Fired Pie."}
{"text":"This place really is like a chipotle for pizza!!   So when you walk in you get a choice of making your own custom pizza or ordering one of their specialty pizzas. Whichever route you decide to choose they make the pizza right in front of you. I ended up getting the Italian white wedding pizza. This pizza comes with ALOT of veggies. A little bit too much for me actually. It was like eating a salad on a pizza. The Alfredo sauce was good which I wish I would've asked for more.   Their pizza is a little bit thin for me. I like my pizza a little bit thicker. They do have some lunch specials too. So it's a good place to grab some lunch."}
{"text":"Bad experience before even getting a pizza...My team at work was trying to order some pizzas for a team meeting. First of their online ordering is garbage, so then we when we tried to call the store, they never answered, finally when we called the other store did they promise a call from their GM, only to get blown off. When we tried to get in touch 3 hours later we were told that the General Manager was too busy to talk to us. Needless to say we decided to order from Mod Pizza. Sad that a company that has a location near a call center employing 2k plus would provide terrible customer service."}
{"text":"Really tasty pizza. Even my son who is a picky eater loved it."}
{"text":"Pizza was ok. A little pricey, but on Tuesdays kids eat free. Very thin, which is ok but my hubby was still hungry after his pizza"}
{"text":"I recently stopped here to have a quick dinner after a movie and I was very impressed with the speed our pizza was delivered (less than 5 minutes) and the freshness of the pizza ingredients.  The actual pizza was tasty, with a perfectly browned, thin crust and delicately placed, fresh toppings.  The end result was a delicious, piping hot slice of goodness.  Also, you should know that I'm not a pizza fan and will only eat it as a meal of last resort, or if my dining companions insist on pizza, so when I say that I genuinely liked this pizza that is high praise indeed coming from me...a bona fide pizza curmudgeon."}
