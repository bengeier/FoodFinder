{"text":"The food is great and the service is OUTSTANDING! The owner is so friendly, and he's quick to recognize repeat customers. I've been to the restaurant numerous times with different friends and family members, and everyone has always enjoyed it. There hasn't been a single thing I ordered that I didn't enjoy. My favourite is the chicken stir-fry in peanut sauce. Yum!"}
{"text":"We found this place online and decided to check it out because it was close to where we were staying. Boy are we happy we did!  Great meal!"}
{"text":"We found this little Vietnamese cafe while searching for a dinner place near our Airbnb on a recent trip to Montreal. The restaurant was packed with a really fun and lively crowd. Our server was especially accommodating to our group, one vegetarian, one carnivore, one with food allergies, and one open to anything except extreme spice!     The food and service were exceptional. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Excellent poulet général tao. Friture légère et généreux morceaux de poulet. Resto très propre et service très courtois. Service rapide comme l'aime."}
{"text":"Have been going to this place for year - but over the time the service and food quality has been constantly declining-

We were with a group of friends yesterday evening-  the order took forever to arrive - the staff seemed confused - they kept on thinking and asking if we finished our diner while we didn't had our main dishes -

My friend took a basil/tomato soup and immediately had to go vomit as it got a very bad batch- food poisoning 

My 20$ dish (shrimp general tao) had 5 poor little un-veined and non- battered shrimps with a sauce that resembled to a ketchup sauce
Mixed with sugar  -  the lazy way of making general tao I call it. The vegetables look like as if they were from a frozen bag but hopefully they're not.  I'm not so keen about eating brocoli and carrots in a Vietnamese dish - what happened to bamboo shoots , bean sprout and mushrooms?

My neighbour at the table kept on complaining how his rice was hard to chew and bland. He kept on complaining.

This used to be a great eatery but if they keep on on loosing quality and service- I'm afraid they will start loosing the clientele - we will loose another restaurant in the village.

So I'll wait for a while or probably never until I go back"}
{"text":"Pros
- Great Food
- Friendly Staff
- Though the decor is pretty cheap like most good Asian restaurants in our city (what's up with that!?), the place is kept pretty clean.

Cons
- Location: It's in a bad part of town; a lot of addicts roam the streets late at night in this area. Therefore, I would suggest to not go there alone at night (just to be safe). Plus, if you park your car in the area, don't leave anything in the backseat as this area is notorious for having smashed windows on the sidewalk.
- Price: My girlfriend and I had a combo and our meal came to 52$ + tip. Though certain things on the menu were cheap, a combo at 26$ at an Asian restaurant is considered pricy.

Don't go there if:
- It's your first date: you can find better priced Asian restaurants (not sure about specifically Vietnamese though) with better atmosphere and in better neighbourhoods.

Do go if:
You're in the area and would like a quick snack (their sandwiches are well priced and tasty)."}
{"text":"My go-to-Viet.  Fan of their banh mi and rice vermicelli dishes.  I have had a lot of the latter in the city and, for some reason theirs is the best.  Is it the noodles?  Theirs is not as wet as others?  Is it the grilled chicken?  Theirs have a lemon grass side note.  Perhaps it's the extras such as pork cracklings and a good amount of peanuts/coriander/pickled vegetables.  Whatever it is, I always make a point to drop in when I'm in the neighbourhood....

My only 'complaint'.....they used to be open during lunch time on Saturdays and Sundays.  No longer since the beginning of the summer.  Hope this changes soon..."}
{"text":"All I have to say is what an amazing place to eat.  I found out about this place through other reviews using my phone for local eats.  When I found nobody had nothing bad to say about this place, I went to eat.  I took a buddy of mine there and he had the Satay soup and I had the Chicken Curry with rice.  The whole meal including soft drinks came to $35 and we had spring roll appetizers as well.

The food is inexpensive and supreme.  Definately worth returning to again.  Gets pretty busy around dinner time, so either show up early or past the dinner hour."}
{"text":"Delicious southeast Asian food, the best I have had in North America.  Owner and family in the restaurant taking care of guests as if they were his own family.  Great experience - sort of wish I Iived next door to this place.  Try the sate soup and one of the noodle dishes.  And bring your own wine or beer!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick late lunch. Had a really good experience. The staff were very friendly and our food arrived fresh and piping hot in less than 10 minutes. 

I had the Peanut Chicken vermicelli combo. It was the best peanut sauce I've ever had PLUS it was served with deep fried greens (which are awesome). For around 15$ per person, you get a lot of awesome food AND you can bring your own wine. Prices are a few dollars less before 3 pm (we went at 330). 

4 stars."}
{"text":"I came in initially for their BAHN MI but the woman told me they were all out??? How does this happen! After my initial shock and was able to gather my thoughts I went with a Pad Thai dish. It wasn't the best Pad Thai I've had but it was still pretty good! Noodles were fresh and it wasn't overly salty. The lime was a nice touch.

Service was pretty quick and the price-tag was very reasonable. The resto is pretty."}
{"text":"Just walk an extra 10 mins to Chinatown. Far from authentic. The pho was not even close, it's suppose to be a beef broth but this was straight up sugar and soy sauce soup."}
{"text":"We stayed in an apartment not far from this restaurant and ended up eating from there twice -  the first time, three of us dined at the restaurant on a weekday night. The food was very good and the service was friendly, but it was rather slow. We all ordered the same main dish - noodles with meat and an eggroll - and yet the table next to us who arrived after us got their appetizers and main courses before we had anything of ours. Not an awful wait, but a little annoying since they only had 4 tables occupied.

The following Saturday, we had a group of friends over and were planning to order pizza when one suggested Vietnamese. We couldn't find a menu for Cafe Saigon online, unfortunately, so my husband called the restaurant and asked for a suggestion of dishes for 8 people. The gentleman who answered the phone suggested a mix of chicken, beef, and shrimp dishes. We also ordered some eggrolls. We were told the food would be ready in 15 minutes. We went promptly to pick it up and lo and behold, despite the fact that the restaurant was pretty crowded, it was boxed up and ready to go. They were just packing up some sauces and some coriander on the side, and they were kind enough to throw in a few extras, utensils, and fortune cookies. Our guests raved about the food and the price was very reasonable. Everyone was really impressed.

Good prices and excellent food. Service seems a bit better on the weekends. We would definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype. 

The good: The little taster of general tao when you are first sitting was nice. The cute water pitchers mean that you're not waiting for service on refills. Their won-ton soup was quite sweet, although I wouldn't regularly eat it, it was a nice change of pace on the classic soup. The place scores an extra star for being BYOB.

The not so good: our waitress wasn't on her game. I get the flow of service, but she really was nowhere to be found the few times she was needed.  The fried dumplings were unlike I had anywhere before, and their texture kept saying \"churro\" rather than peanut butter dumpling. The main dishes themselves were.. ok. Their classic combos are 3 options, chicken brochette, ginger chicken, or spicy chicken stir fry. My date and I had the ginger chicken and spicy stir fry which ended up being what really bugged me out. The spicy stirfry was literally the ginger chicken dish but with a spoonful of Chiu Chow (chili) sauce on the top, not like it was actually put in during the cooking process to seep. The food was lackluster to say the least, and the decor of the place was a mix of traditional and tiki, then covered in hockey Philadelphia Flyers Christmas themed hockey paraphernalia which just made it an eye sore and removed any possible sense of atmosphere.Overall I don't get why people are so into this place, doubt I'll be back even if I am in the area, Americanized in the worst kind of way."}
{"text":"Hey, great place and reasonable.  The dumplings are fried and tasty.  I ordered satay beef soup large-it was plenty.  My friend got vermicelli pork and it was more than enough.  Our whole bill was under 40 CD.  Service is great.  You need to byob and the space is funky being a concerted residence.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Nothing special. Don't like the ambiance much. And the food wasn't anything to write home about. I got Pad Thai and it was over sauced. Family got Saigon beef and it had great flavor but was really chewy. The family who owns it was fun though."}
{"text":"Génial petit restaurant, caché dans l'ombre de la triste et imposante place Dupuis, et en retrait de la clinquante rue Ste-Catherine.  Le service y est courtois et rapide, les prix sont extrêmement abordable, même pour le souper, les portions raisonnables, le poulet est croustillant sans être pour autant enfoui sous une tonne de panure.  En plus c'est un apportez votre vin et vous avez une bonne SAQ à deux pas de là.  Une option des plus recommandables dans l'est du centre-ville!"}
{"text":"uhhhhhhMAZING!!!! 

BYOB and eat, drink and be merry at this excellent cafe. The lemongrass beef noodles is just awesome. The general tso's chicken is great! Just great great food! you will not be sorry. Service is great, vibe is fun and lively. Fabulous time!"}
{"text":"J'ai toujours reçu un service très courtois à chacune de mes visites et je crois y être allée à une dizaine de fois. La qualité de la nourriture est indiscutable. Le général tao est savoureux ainsi que le pad thai et les rouleaux de printemps également. Chaque sauce est parfumée et en harmonie avec le plat proposé. Le propriétaire nous voyant revenir régulièrement nous faisait souvent goûter à d'autres plats lorsque nous attendions nos plats pour emporter. C'est gentil :) À découvrir caché dans le brouhaha de la place dupuis et des jardins gamelin!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my colleagues. Good to know, you can make a reservation by phone.
Cheap place if you want to eat your lunch as they offer 3 special with soup or a roll (about $10). However, the place is busy and noisy during lunch. It's a little dark without windows."}
{"text":"Yummy!! 
The spicey satay soup is simply perfect for a chilly evening!"}
{"text":"J'y vais depuis 20 ans. Poulet à l'épicerie forte est délicieux.  Le fils a repris le commerce de sa mère depuis quelques années et me reconnaît toujours même si je m'y rends une fois par année."}
{"text":"Went w friend. She had a chicken spring roll (fine) and a delicious soupe tonkinoise (absolutely marvellous broth).

I had a glazed pork spring roll (meh... slightly pastey texture) and a chicken red curry. I didn't like the chicken in the latter but all other elements were strong. Loved the curry - fab balance of sweet and heat.

Service was excellent. Server noticed I didn't eat the chicken and comped a shrimp curry. I asked for a small portion and it was great. Same star curry and lovely pieces of generously sized shrimp.

I'd return since I think the chicken issue was an outlier and I can live w/o spring rolls. Will prob get their soup next time - was jealous seeing my friend consume most of the bowl!"}
{"text":"I don't know how to rate this more than a star since I didn't even get a chance to taste their food. Please let me explain.

After reading so many good reviews about this place, I decided to go give it a try. I really wanted a good pho! 

So i got in the restaurant. Warm, cozy atmosphere. There were about 3-4 tables with customers eating. So far so good! I proceeded towards the waitress at the counter and asked if it was possible to order to go. Her reply:\"We don't have the sandwich.\" Um. Ok. So i asked again to which she said yes. 

Me: Do you have dac biet pho (all dressed pho)?

Lady: No. We only serve pho with rare beef.

Me: Ok...

She interrupts me

Lady: We cater to a \"white\" clientele palate. If you want authentic vietnamese pho, this isn't the place for you. You won't like it here.

WHAT???? 

This was the first time someone says something like this to me. So i simply said thank you and left the restaurant. Was she trying to do me a favour? Was she trying to get rid of me? I don't know anymore. I am perplexed and kinda shocked to be honest. Too bad for her interrupting me. I would of given it a try regardless of the fact they only serve rare beef pho. Guess I'll never know..."}
{"text":"Best pad thai in town + it's cheap! 

The place looks simple but don't be fooled, the meal quality is on par with the best (and much more expensive) places out there.

The owner is also very nice and full of energy.

Recommended."}
{"text":"Very good & BYOB.
I took the dinner for two and those cold rolls shrimp rolls are great too!

Glutten free & Lactose free possible."}
