{"text":"If you are looking for an excellent breakfast at a reasonable price this is the place to go!  Excellent service and most importantly great home fries and hash browns.  All Candian breakfast is first rate and so are the eggs Benedict.  Place is on east side of Leslie north of Davis by Shanahan Ford."}
{"text":"This is a nice place to go if you want good food without the Frills. Living in Newmarket, I never even knew that the previous Italian Cuisine had vacated until I discovered it on Yelp. I like to cook and I can whip up bacon, eggs, homefries, toast and coffee at home for way less than what I paid here. But that's what it's like when you eat out anywhere.  There was nothing really special about this place although it was full on the Saturday morning that we had visited. Luckily, we got the last table which someone had vacated and the server had rushed to clear it off for us.  Otherwise, I doubt that we would have stood in line and waited, as it is simply just one big room with lots of tables crowded together in rows. The table next to us were only 2 ft away and I felt like we were having breakfast with them...although they didn't talk ( but listened to our conversation I'm sure!)  The food was cooked to perfection but the coffee was not refilled as quickly as I would have liked. It was kinda weak but I enjoyed it as I take it black. They are kinda stingy with the extras....meaning, my daughter had to ask for sweetener and was tossed a few packets but she takes 4 with each cup. Needless to say we had to make a bee-line to Starbucks so that she could get her coffee-fix. I noticed that the gent at the table adjacent to us had to ask for jam packets and they only tossed him ONE! But I'm sure they would have doled out more if asked, but do we really have to beg for refills of coffee and jam, etc?  Also my daughter doesn't eat potatoes and asked if she could get fruit instead. They substituted 2 big chunks of watermelon instead. Yep, that's what they call fruit! Too frugal in my opinion!  However I do like what they did with the wall mural which was definitely an Italian scene from the previous establishment. They filled it with cut out photos of the owners and servers (I surmise) and patrons all sitting at tables enjoying their food. It looked totally awesome!  It was nice to go out for a Saturday breakfast and not have to cook or clean up after. No special treatment but I do like the fact that I didn't have to mop up grease on my over easy eggs like at Sunset Grill and other places here in Newmarket.  In the end, the tab wasn't all that economical , the service wasn't all that special ....but I probably will come back just for the absence of grease!"}
{"text":"This location has gone by many names, and I've eaten at them all. Donelly's is worth a visit. Whomever took this place over knows how to make a waffle - I've been there twice, and that's what I keep getting. Last time I had a side of sausage - also delicious. Prices are good, service is welcoming and friendly - its just a great spot to grab Sunday breakfast with a friend."}
{"text":"I love breakfast joints, and this was one of the better organized joints I've visited lately. The options were wonderful (even something for my mom, who is vegetarian), and the food is generously portioned. The waitstaff were wonderful polite, and helpful to us first-timers.  It's easy to drive by and not even notice that this place exists, but it's definitely worth a try, especially for anyone who loves breakfast!"}
{"text":"Affordable and cozy. In for a late breakfast and there were about 25 people eating, pretty much packing the place. The attentive staff were efficient and friendly. Eggsellent Eggs Benedict! I even paid with APPLEPAY!!!"}
{"text":"A preacher dressed like Elvis showed up and ruined my lunch. Can't make this up.. Then started singing Elvis tunes crazy right. Food was good..."}
{"text":"Our hockey team comes for breakfast every Monday and Wednesday for special 3eggs bacon home fries coffee for 4.99 before 11am.Always good. Excellent service from Tesha and Christine."}
{"text":"We love donnellys! We usually grab brunch or lunch on Saturdays. Food is amazing! We have recently fallen in love with their delicious burgers! They are a must try! My kids love their pancakes and they make a mean eggs Benedict too."}
{"text":"Definitely top value for the money.  Looking for breakfast, the waitress directed me to their daily breakfast special--3 eggs, bacon, toast and potatoes for about $6.  Everything was excellent, and for dollars less than Sunset Grill and some other local spots.  Why would anyone want to pay more for a breakfast at McD's?  The place is small, but maybe that is part of its charm.  This place goes to the top of my list!"}
{"text":"Checked this place out around noon on a Sunday I was surprised that Donnelly's was so busy at this time of day. The place is located on a main thoroughfare in Newmarket in an out of way place. I was passing it everyday on my way to work and I always go out for later breakfast on the weekends, better than sitting in a hotel. Well I have to say this place was hoping and the seating was maxed out. I managed to get a spot and quickly the waitress was on me helping me decide what to order. Very helpful staff. Coffee was awsome. I had the bacon and ham omelette and rye toast, everything was cooked to perfection. My only beef is that I felt rushed to get out as a group of regulars was eyeing  up my spot for there big group. Seeing I was only one taking up four spots I rushed. There should be a few tables for one or two people."}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast Yesterday.  The food was very good.  I had eggs with bacon and sausage, and fruit in the side.  The eggs over eat were cooked perfectly and the sausage is fantastic!  I have some pretty severe good issues, and Donnelly's always is able to serve me a good breakfast with lots of options.  They are also able to cater to gluten free.  Just let them know that you need a separate Pam for the back or sausage.  The waitress was very attentive, but not hovering.    The prices for breakfast were very good for the amount of food we got.  One of the best values for the buck I've been too."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast/lunch diners in Newmarket. From the moment you enter you will feel like family. I've yet to find something on the menu that I don't like. Excellent food, attentive service and great prices."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast eggs home fries delicious. Pancake so fluffy kids enjoy it price is way cheaper than other breakfast places. Will come back for sure :)"}
