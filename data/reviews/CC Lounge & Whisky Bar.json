{"text":"Great place and friendly staff. Came here on a Friday night after work for some drinks and snacks. The cocktails are great. The food could have been better (we had the fries and wings) but it still satisfied our hunger. This place has an amazing atmosphere and the decor is beautiful. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a different level of entertainment you should check out CC lounge. Sophistication to its outmost. Great food, great service and great whiskey!!! And more ........"}
{"text":"Nice venue and great atmosphere.  Must try the burger,  it's taste like a gourmet version of the Big Mac.  The steak beef tar tar is another great item."}
{"text":"I would avoid this place at all costs. The food was over priced and not very good at all. Good cocktail menu though so if you want a drink that could be a spot. The part for me that will ensure I never go back is the service. The manager treated customers very poorly and was rude and arrogant. While waiting inside we let them know a group of 15 people (mix of races) were waiting to get into the bar for a birthday. While outside, I watched the bouncers and the manager let in about 25 other people that fit, in what he described in his words \"our profile\" while the others waited to a point they simply left. Of course we headed out as well and will never go back.  Really unfortunate as this city and specifically the Market is a welcoming area for all. To turn away a group of 35-40yrs old who clearly wanted to spend at your establishment for dinner and drinks all due to the color of their skin was just wrong and something you wouldn't expect to see in this day and age.   Hopefully they remember the city they operate in. I won't be going back again."}
{"text":"Went here this past saturday all I can say is this place is very chic and trendy ! The music is great the drinks are fantastic everyone is dressed immaculately. The decor is something to take in. We had a stand up table with bottle service which was great ! The entire staff there from the doorman to concierge to waitresses to the manager was totally professional and something other places in the area should be envious of ! If I could give 10 stars for this place I would !"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere  . Unforgettable amazing service . Couldn't ask for better. Wide range of drinks . Good selection of whiskeys.  Just the LCBO ones thou.  Yummy snacks . Must try the Brussels sprouts and flat breads . Will definitely go back .  Thanks Sunny and Matt"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night. Great music, good ambiance, good whiskey selection. It turned from a sit-down whiskey lounge to a dance floor at some point in the night where they remove bar stools and have an open dance floor. We got there early and got in without wait, but there was a line when we left. It did smell like cigarettes I side which is a negative for me. Otherwise, good spot for drink& dancing."}
{"text":"Had dinner and drinks here for a friend's birthday. Nice decor including an enormous birdcage and suspended swinging chandeliers. Arrived at 8, and aside from a party in the back half of the lounge, I was the only one there. As the night wore on though, it definitely filled up.   For dinner, I thought about going with the steak and frites but ultimately settled on the cheese and charcuterie plate. Nice selection and variety with that dish. Really enjoyed it! The highlight was the guided tour of the whiskey tunnel. Learned some interesting things and levelled up whiskey game a little bit too.   Service was a bit spotty at times. Our group had some difficulty tracking our server down at several points in the evening. Settling the bill was a bit of an ordeal as well, as  it took a lot of time to track down a machine for those of us paying by credit/debit.   From what I gathered from some of the folks working that evening, this place is still in its first few weeks of being open. It's got great potential and I'd definitely give it another shot once its been open for a few more months."}
{"text":"I've been here for quite a few times and I highly recommend this place. There was not one time I had a bad experience, and it's nice to check a place that you don't fork out an entire's life saving to have a great time. Some of the good things include: i) No cover, ii) Quality Drinks, iii) Amazing music, iv) Friendly staff/ management, v) Good crowd.   PS The management is beyond friendly, as they are very accommodating should you have any concerns."}
{"text":"I went there around 730 for some dinner and drink. The quinoa risotto and Brussels sprouts were really good. Great vege options  Amazing ambiance. I think it becomes crowded later in the day."}
{"text":"My husband and I were visiting Toronto from Calgary and made reservations for pre-dinner cocktails at CC Lounge, as it was located fairly close to our hotel. The venue itself is beautiful. I always love going to places that take such care and pride in the detals of the ambiance and decor. The cocktail and menu selection, as well as the prices, were excellent but what made our experience so enjoyable was the unbelievable staff and superior level of customer service we received. The gentleman who was serving us was incredibly friendly, laid-back, great to talk to, and really went above and beyond to ensure we had a great time. The whisky tunnel they have was very cool to check out as well. Will definitely be back to CC Lounge next time we're in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Awesome spot! Great vibe, a nice crowd, and away from the King West mess."}
{"text":"Everything was perfect  .I chose this place to surprise my husband for his birthday as his favourite drink is Whiskey.He really enjoyed it. We also had a tour of the tounel and it was so interesting.Thanks to Johnson that made us so happy by lightning candles on our desert for my husbands birthday."}
{"text":"I probably wouldn't come here to party, but I do think it's a nice after work drink spot.   They have happy hour from 4pm to 7:19pm daily. These are quality 2 to 3 ounce cocktails that are delicious (and will definitely get you tipsy after a couple)!  The snacks and finger foods are pretty good too. Ambience is a bit fancy with crystal chandeliers and dark decor, but don't let it get you intimidated. Staff has always been friendly for all my visits."}
{"text":"More club than lounge and there is no point in having a long list of whiskey options if many of them are out of stock. That said , the first night club I've ever seen with patrons aged 20 to 50+ that didn't feel creepy or seedy , so credit for that achievement."}
{"text":"Visited their booth at Front Street Foods (\"CC on Front\") and tried the $6 Brussels sprouts. The sign said it's one of the top 5 dishes in Toronto and I'm not sure what that's based on, but they were delicious. The syrup with the slightly charred Brussels sprouts was a perfect combination. Their website says the syrup is whiskey-infused, but I wouldn't have known.  There was some shredded cheese too, which didn't add much. It might've been better incorporated if it were melted, but it's not a big issue. I'd say the dish was fine as it was.  I do wish the portion was slightly bigger. I shared it with someone else as a side, which was fine. It was just so good, I didn't want it to end!"}
{"text":"Love this place!   Leonard and all the staff were terrific! The scotch, bourbon, & rye selection is the best in the area. They are extremely knowledgeable and accommodating. The decor is funky and fun. I came here for the first time for a before dinner single malt and ended up spending several hours leaving with new friends.   Well done! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night with one of my girlfriends. Decor is very nice - hanging chandeliers across the room. The servers are super friendly. Didn't feel like we had a designated server. Two of them would come by every so often to check up on us and to chat with us on absolutely random things. Don't need to be a whiskey person to enjoy the place."}
{"text":"Great spot on a Saturday. Free to get in, nice atmosphere, good music. The Dj played a range of hits to cater to the crowd. Energy was high. Had a great time and enjoyed a few good drinks. Initially found the spot looking for a nice chill lounge for a date. Ended up being a party once we made it in - had a great night!"}
{"text":"Great Service from the Doorman to the Bartenders/Servers! It was my first visit there last Saturday and both took the time to explain what the concept of the place is. Bartender also made sure to go through the whiskey list with me as I wanted to learn more about their selection. She also helped me pick which one I'd like. And they have great cocktails as well!"}
{"text":"Great music, awesome atmosphere. Best lounge setting in Toronto. The owners are always walking around and mingling with the crowd. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Nadia was the sweetest most awesome bartender! This place is very sophisticated and well put together. Drinks and service was great. I just came in and was on a long flight from  WA so I needed a drink. Me and my girls stopped in to CC Lounge and felt underdressed. We stuck around because Nadia made us feel comfortable and was awesome! The owner was also great. Thank you guys for showing us Americans a great time ;) we will be back next time and will be dressed and ready to party ;) Ps .Sorry if I spelled her name wrong."}
{"text":"Went here last night for drinks  It was my first time there and I actually liked it quite a lot .  The calamari was great, loved it.  The truffle fries were alright  The server was very friendly & checked up on us quite a lot to see if we needed anything & if everything was good  The dj was great, loved the music  The security i believe he was, was a joy to meet , very friendly & some great moves haha  & the owner was actually also there making sure everything was going smoothly & he was very friendly & a pleasure to meet also.  Definitely reccommend,  Definitely coming back with the girls !"}
{"text":"I never met a Glen I didn't like (Glenmorangie, Glenfiddich and Glenlivet). The scotch expert, James Arvanitopoulis the Director and CC Historian, treated me to a very special 21 year old single malt scotch the Glenlivet Archive 21. This was truly a phenomenal flavour. The dark caramel and orange smokiness enveloping my senses brought me to a Scottish peat fired keg. For the full article go to Torontonicity.ca"}
{"text":"Hands down, coolest places in the city right now! its a malt and whiskey bar that turns into a lounge on the weekends - celebrated my birthday here over the weekend and they gave a VIP service! no cover, line up, no coat check fee, and the service was just extra-ordinary! great ambience and music in a cozy environment - love the décor, after a few drinks, the chandeliers look straight!  apps are great, we had the truffle fries, nachos and brussel sprouts over 2 visits! delicious great cocktails esp the whiskey sours! truly a gem, I hope they stay A+++ for a while!:)"}
{"text":"Whiskey lover's dream! Lots of options, at various price points.   The food was pretty good. But let me tell you... the brussels sprouts will change your life. It's frekain' amazing. Doesn't matter if you are a carnivore, or hate brussels sprouts...you will love these. Just a note... just because it's vegetable, I promise you it's not at all healthy. ;)  Sprouts aside - a great spot to catch a drink with friends or even spend a Saturday night! The bartenders and servers are knowledgeable and very accommodating. The pre-set whiskey flights are great if you are new to Whiskey, or an enthusiast looking for variety."}
{"text":"Came for happy hour with some girlfriends visiting from out of town. It's one of the only places in the neighborhood that seems to have happy hour on Fridays, which are from 4-7:19. The ambiance inside is SUPER cute and trendy but don't feel obligated to be especially dressed up if you're just coming for after work drinks on a weekday or something.   The cocktails are strong and made with yummy ingredients. Not your typical rum + coke kind of happy hour. The cocktails are speciality drinks but I believe you can also get wine and beer as well. There's bar seating and huge booths for large groups, but the booths are nice and intimate as well.   I had the sour (their take on a whisky sour), Harlem sunset, and Kentucky mule. The Kentucky mule was probably my favorite followed by the Harlem sunset. Clearly it was a whisky night for me.   Food was tasty as well. I had chicken wings and fries. Ended up ordering a second round of fries because they were THAT good.   I would have given this place 5 stars but there was some weird stuff happening with our server and the way they tallied up our drink totals. At the end of a 20 minute ordeal I feel we still may have even been overcharged one of our drinks. It was a mess. And likely the result of her trying to handle too many tables at once and not keeping track of who was ordering what and from what table. It definitely put a sour taste in our mouths so we just paid and left.   But other than that, go on down for dranks!"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of going out but I've been here on several occasions for birthdays and this is one lounge that I actually enjoy going to. The drinks and food are great, the service is good and the music is amazing. Most importantly, I like that the crowd here is more mature.  It does feel small just because it is long and narrow but that's the only \"con\" if you can even really call it that. If you get a booth you tend to have more space!"}
{"text":"Always have a great time and experience here. The staff is courteous. The decor is nice. Who doesn't love a bar with a cage? Definitely a great spot for whiskey lovers and I recommend doing the whiskey tunnel tour. I've only encountered a line up a few times here and that was mainly in the summer time. Once the weather gets colder, I've never come across a line up. Also, coat check was free when I went!"}
{"text":"Loved it here! Loved the more mature crowd, music, and the service was great. The food was also good -- the fries were to die for and the drinks were to satisfaction.  I also really enjoyed the upbeat atmosphere, the dim lighting, the modern decor, and the bird cage was a nice touch   I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"While in Toronto I was looking for a nice lounge to visit and get some drinks for a nice night with my girlfriend. I decided to give CC Lounge a try based off the pictures and story about its founding. Upon arriving I heard familiar music (2000s to New Hip Hop/R&B) and what I anticipated to be a semi-quiet, chic lounge was actually a lively bar full of people enjoying drinks and dancing the night away. Despite my initial goal of a more laid back night the drinks and music kept me dancing and singing all night! Unfortunately, I forgot to save pictures and videos from this night =( Definitely make sure you get Canadian dollars before coming if you plan on paying in cash.  I highly recommend visiting here while in 'The 6' and will be back my next trip!"}
{"text":"Went here for my best friend's birthday last night, we had dinner and then stayed for the dj and dancing after 10. their food menu is okay, priced well but for a good reason, the portions aren't huge or filling. I don't think it's meant to be super filling, but the dishes that I tried were pretty good.   Their 1933 cheese and meat board had some really good chicken liver pate... we finished it before trying anything else lol Some ok cheese, nothing to write home about. The meat was standard salami and prosciutto as well, the sea salt chocolate were a really nice touch.   I had their special which was a cerviche served on endive... more like an appetizer than a main meal but since I ate a lot in the afternoon I was happy about it. My friend's steak and mushroom pie turned out to be 2 empanada looking pies, not what he was expecting but good none the less.   The steak and fries a few of my friends ordered looked really good. I wanted to try their desserts but didn't get a chance cause i was stuffed. We had to fill a $500 tab for our table so we ordered a lot of craft cocktails.   We tried 5 of them, the sour, mule and a few others. I'd recommend the mule for the ginger beer used.   Then after dinner we took aotur of their whiskey tunnel, got some cool history and tips on drinking different types of whiskey. The owner himself gave the tour and seemed pretty knowledgable and friendly, he even took a picture with us.   When we went back out everything was transformed to a dj party, it was packed! We had fun for the next few hours dancing, definitely too loud to talk at that point.   Pros: The music during dinner was awesome, covers of hit songs but done very indie style.  The decor is definitely a plus, huge chandeliers and a bird cage by the front with a cabaret dancer.  Friendly owner and cool concept Coat Check  Cons:  Inconsistent staff: Bar staff was rude, dj booth was inaccessible, our waitress literally replied with I just got here... when I asked her what the daily specials were... shouldn't be on the floor if you aren't prepared. Through out the night she hard to find and seemed to pay a lot of attention to other tables."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and personally I love this place. I've had some really good times with groups of friends here. They have some pretty cool drinks and during happy hour, it's about $7 each. The Seebach cocktail is my personal favorite. They also have some unique dishes here that I personally love, I ordered the Brussel Sprouts and I can't believe how awesome they. It's infused with whiskey and maple syrup. It's a must try dish here. Also tried the brisket nachoes and they were good as well. We ordered some pretty good whiskeys every time we came here. We ordered the Canadian and International flights and the staff are really knowledgeable about their whiskey giving us some further insight on the history and the tastes of whiskey. On Thursdays, it's buck a shuck $1 oysters. I love oysters so it's a good day of the week to visit here. Overall, great vibes here and feels like a party on Thursday and weekend nights. Staff are super friendly and great customer service. Always a favorite spot so I'll definitely come back here and would highly recommend it to others."}
{"text":"HAPPY HOUR COCKTAILS!!!! From 4-7:19pm on weekdays and a prohibition themed bar!!! That's what caught my attention. Manhattans and old fashions at great prices for a high end bar in toronto is on point. I'm pretty sure it was around  $8 for a cocktail. Great place to eat and enjoy great drinks before any event in toronto.  The burger was amazing and even came with complimentary Brussel sprouts during happy hour. I definitely would get the burger again.  Also the staff were super friendly which really made my experience. I heard about their whiskey tunnel they had and asked the bartender about it. She was super nice and knowledgeable about whisky and gave my buddy and I a personal tour of the tunnel! I definitely will be coming back! Thank you CCA lounge!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great selection of whiskey friendly and accommodating staff - though bar service is recommended when it gets busy. I've been here a few times, first time was with a large social group on a Friday night. They had a DJ come on later in the evening and though the dance floor was small lots of people were dancing and the place was packed. Nice friendly atmosphere that made me come back. Plus, I'm a whiskey drinker."}
{"text":"We dropped by during happy hour (4pm-7:19pm). Although it was really quiet when we went at 6pm, we still really enjoyed our experience there. It was our first time at a whiskey bar and we actually walked out learning A LOT about whiskey and the 'proper' way to drink it. The staff was just amazing!! With their endless whiskey selections..it was awesome...I would go back again just to try something new"}
{"text":"The bar opens at 5pm as per their website. I took a uber to be there after 5 and an employee tells me they open at 6pm. Not nice and not really appreciated in the winter cold."}
{"text":"Came here before a show at the Sony Centre. Really cool vibe here,  very nice staff that make you feel special.  The music was a little loud for me tho,  made it hard to talk.  I could see this place being slammed on the weekends.  Our table tried a variety of their whiskey cocktails.  Some were better then others,  but that's personal preference.   The food was tasty, but portions were small for what you got.  I ordered the fried chicken \"big plate \" and I only got 3 tiny pieces of chicken and a few pieces of tomato and watermelon.  I was still hungry!   I turn ordered dessert, that wasn't very good. I got the brownie with ice cream (very icy). Not the best.   I recommend this place for the drinks and the atmosphere,  not so much for the food."}
{"text":"i am a regular and usually buy bottles, everyone i come with has been treated fantastic, great vibes, great service, best of all if you dont finish your bottles they will save them for you. so far my experience has been consistently excellent."}
{"text":"13 of us traveled to Toronto from Michigan to celebrate a friends Birthday. Excellent experience all around, Costas and his staff took care of our every need, food was excellent. We dined we laughed and we danced. Perfect addition to our trip to Toronto."}
{"text":"On the hunt for cocktails we were waiting for BarChef to open and D.W had closed for the Holidays. We stumble in here and are surprised it's dead, even more surprising is how clubby it looks and to be dead was even worse. Free coat check was a nice touch, DJ up front just sort of vibing to himself and in his own trance with only 4 other people here besides us and staff. I wasn't sure if it was pin drop quiet because the DJ didn't want to drown us out (thanks for that though) or if it was simply quite for no one being there.   I didn't really notice it was a Whiskey place at first, just that I wanted a proper cocktail, tired of seeing nuclear cherries, old vermouth. I was actually in the mood for something a little outside their fortified wine selection so I adjusted for a more brown, bitter and stirred narrative. I ordered negroni while I mulled the menu over.   It has a very club/lounge feel with a 2 room split, chandelliers, but also a strange bird cage which we were invited to pose in. We also got the whiskey tunnel tour along with the noted local figures from their prohibition flattery. No real history dating back to the era, it's merely a carved space behind the bar in the back with some bars. Bathroom is right in the middle, sort of small assuming this place actually fills up.  The staff was incredible. Attentive, answered all my questions, chatted with us for a bit, but not in that sort of bottle girl \"here let me pour this and help you drink it\" sort of way. The bartender gave us some advice on our other cocktail travels and we bonded being cocktail nerds.  The Brussel sprouts were good, maple in Canada is common, not too rich. The proscuitto wrapped item was super duper rich, like too much to take. Nachos had great plating and was certainly not bar food, the avo crema was ok seeing as Canadians don't know what guacamole is. I prefer fresh jalapenos as pickled are too bland. The $40 10 piece chicken bucket sort of threw me off, very odd to pair, but they do a Triple pairing for whiskey, cheese and chocolate.   JP Wiser is really popular in Canada. I had my old fashioned made with no muddling, old forester. Solid, the cherry garnish is house made and not nearly as sweet as luxardo. They like mixing gin and whiskey, so the bootlegging bastard was great, so was the bimbo, but again I chose no muddling. I went Left hand instead of Boulevardier which is that negroni-esque split equal drink.   By now I was quite ready for more drinks and BarChef had opened, we bid adieu and our bill wasn't that bad considering I had 5 drinks, apps and was with 2 others. I felt like the Laga 12 was overpriced. I expected more Japanese.   I had a great time overall, but decided on 4 stars for the little things. For a place this size you should really have 100+ whiskies and be more knowledgeable about them. I was sad to see bottle prices of CR Black/Rye, Canadian Club. Like those are well drinks and who buys bottles? Too clubby. The American Whiskey selection was pretty standard. Solid Scotch selection. Kavalan Soloist Sherry was a real treat. I didn't get a chance to try the Indian whiskey's, but hear great things."}
{"text":"These guys had a booth at an outdoor event and we got the brussel sprouts. They were so good! The serving was pretty big. I split them with someone as a side dish as we were trying food from a few vendors. This was our favourite and the size was big enough for us. There was an unexpected sweet sauce on them which I assume was maple syrup."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday party and had a blast!    The front has more of the restaurant vibe, the middle and back of the place has a more lounge like place, complete with dancer's cage and bar  :)  The music was great and the service was super friendly.  Our friends arranged to have apps go around - tried the sliders and a few other apps - all were good.  The drinks were also nice (it's a whiskey joint)   It's definitely a happening place and I can see it being packed on the weekend.  The cost check is free which is a nice touch.  I'd definitely come back here - it's definitely a classy but fun place to party.  Put on your heels and sparkles ladies and come here for a fun night out."}
{"text":"Tried this spot last night. Stayed about 5 minutes. There was no line which was good, if I'd waited to get inside I would have been mad. Coat check was free too.  The crowd was 35-55. I'm 30 and felt like a baby. The decor was really cool, I liked the idea but unless you have somewhere to sit standing is annoying since the place is like a long bowling alley- so you're constantly getting pushed. No one was dancing, just standing there.  I didn't even bother getting a drink because you couldn't get to the bar (there were multiple).  Maybe if you had a booth it would be okay, but otherwise I was disappointed. I thought it was going to be more like a speakeasy. Sadly it was not."}
{"text":"Great service and a beautiful atmosphere for post work drinks or socials. Don't forget that they have happy hour for classic cocktails till 719pm daily. The fries go exceptionally well with the drinks too."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I just happened to run across this place looking for a fun night out, and it was exactly what we both wanted.  The space was large enough that we were able to carve out our own corner, the DJ was on point, and the atmosphere was loud, fun, and just the right amount of everything. We had a great time here and would definitely consider this place next time we go out in Toronto."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here on Canada Day during our honeymoon. We arrived right when they opened, so of course there wasn't a big crowd. But the staff was so friendly, we were glad to have the place mostly to ourselves. They do have quite the whisky list, as one would expect from a whisky bar. The ambiance is great - the space is divided and is more of a lounge up front and club in the back. And though we didn't stay late enough for dancing in the back room, it seemed like it would be quite the place for it. We also learned a lot during our tour through the \"whisky tunnel\" including the fact that outside of the US and Ireland, whisky is spelled without an e. We had a difficult time tearing ourselves away at the end of the night, as we really came to love everyone we interacted with there. So glad we were able to stumble upon this place, they really made us feel at home! I highly recommend stopping in or, if you're like us, stay for hours on end. Oh and make sure to try the brussel sprouts - they are fantastic!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the atmosphere. The crowd is mixed. The music is ok. Pricey but CC lounge has super friendly staff."}
{"text":"CC lounge is a lounge in the front, club in the back - our pseudo club, the same way Brassai had or still has a side room club.  Not to be confused with C Lounge (does that still exist? I don't get West of Yonge often)  We had the lobster nachos which were fabulous. I loved every bite. We also had some old fashions - also very good.   For a fancy place this was not too expensive. My view is it's actually nicer than Pravda and at very least just as nice as DW Alexander. It's bigger than the later by quite a bit.  Great staff. Daily specials, worth a visit."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in Toronto , the food is perfect and the staff are amazing . I would highly recommend this place for having quality time in Toronto ."}
{"text":"I definitely recommend this place for anyone wanting to celebrate their birthday.  I was there celebrating my bday and I'm beyond glad I choose this spot. The staff were my first impression and they were fricking awesome. The vibe if the place fun, music was on point all night long, drinks were mixed perfectly and the booth I was provided was great in that even though the place was pac6 nked, being a Saturday night and all, I or my friend never felt like there want enough room to feel comfortable.   But to make a great night even better. My booth was provided a free large plate of fries and the manager came up to me and gave me a black wristband. I was then told that with that wristband I could get free drinks for the rest of the night at any bar.   Definitely one the best birthday I had in years thanks to CC lounge."}
{"text":"I've been a few times and they just seem to get better every time.  My last visit was on a slow weeknight with some clients. It was great because it wasn't too loud, lots of space to move around and was easy to strike up a conversation with the staff. With the leisurely feel of the night, I had the time to try some mixed drinks I wouldn't normally have tried.  The best part was the whiskey tunnel though. We did some tastings, got to sample some different types - bourbon, Canadian, Japanese, scotch - and got a bit of Toronto history as well. It was especially fun for my clients, a great way to impress.  Weekends are much busier but for a club, not too crowded. You can still find room at one of the massive bars. No line up, no cover, which is nice. Older crowd, 25+ with average age probably mid 30s. Definitely an upscale feel, dress to impress.  Overall, it's a super cool place. Great decor, great drinks, great vibe. I'll have to come back for dinner sometime..."}
{"text":"I was in Toronto for one night from Texas. My boyfriend is a whisky drinker so stopping in here was a no-brainer. This bar was well decorated and had a upscale vibe. It was packed and we didn't make reservations but the host was kind and recommenced the bar, which was probably the best idea anyway because the bartenders were great here! Typically, when I go out, I feel cheated when ordering craft drinks. Too much ice and not enough of the ingredients you're paying $15-$20 per glass for. CC's craft cocktails were actually done right... so much so, we ordered a few more rounds and stayed longer then planned. Also, try the buffalo cauliflower and blue cheese appetizer if you're hungry!! It was too yummy."}
{"text":"Lovely decor great service with classy booths and some kinky bird cages for dancing after dark."}
{"text":"Bad and good. Great space and theme. They are new and felt like staff are either not confident or the manager is too all over them to be confident in themselves    Love they price house wine by the ounce. An excellent idea to not have to have a big pour all the time.  Bad is the food. The charcuterie was very good but fries are frozen and wings were soggy. Who likes soggy wings. When we asked they give us crispy wings the manager acted like we had a problem....not familiar with how wings should be. He replaced them after making us feel like we were the problem but still not as crispy as a good wing in a good restaurant.  They are clearly having growing pains but in a neighbourhood without much competition. I hope they figure it out as it is a nice addition to the neighbourhood.   It is a cool place for drinks but go somewhere else for dinner."}
{"text":"Wow, and I thought this was simply place for a cocktail with a great bourbon selection.  Met some buddies there last night and found out that they not only had a killer Happy Hour from 4pm until 7:19 ( the month and year prohibition was passed ) they also had dollar oysters on Thursdays.  The food was incredible and not what I was expected.  Along with a couple awesome freshly ground burgers, we had 2 dozen oysters, grilled calamari and their grilled brussel sprouts, which were the best I have tasted.  Service was amazing and very friendly and the décor and DJ create a great atmosphere.  I will definitely be back for dinner and you can't beat the drinks."}
{"text":"If you want to dust off your dancing shoes but don't want to get stuck in a club with tinyboopers then this is the place to be.     We came here after dinner around 10pm. There was no line up, no cover and best of all....free coat check!!!   Scorrrrre!  The average crowd here is late 30's early 40's but still dressed to impress.   Although it's call a whiskey lounge, there are plenty of bottle service booths and decent amount of space to dance with a DJ spinning top 40s.  There is no dress code here but I wouldn't recommend showing up in running shoes and ball cap. You will stand out.   Lastly, don't be discourage by the sound of whiskey lounge, they have plenty of spirits and cocktails to tickle your fancy.  I ordered the sloe gin fizz which is 2 different kinds of gin with lime and splash of ginger beer and it was yummay. They don't cheap out on the alcohol that's for sure."}
{"text":"Came here for a work event this week. The staff and bartenders are very friendly, and its a nice clean place with great food and a good beer and whisky menu. It's a smaller venue in a great location. I will definitely be back here."}
{"text":"The decor in here is awesome !! The chandeliers and lights give it a upscale but yet a laid back feel . The birdcage is a lot of fun and it invites the Inner party animal to come out and show their moves . The middle bartender did not make the greatest of drinks . If you a are a drinks connoisseur then avoid the middle bar and bartenders lol . Free coat check is nice in the winter times . Majority of the people in the place were dressed well so dress to impress here . The bathrooms were clean and maintained well given the traffic in there . I would suggest going in early or after 12:30 to avoid waiting in the lineup . Music is top 40': and old school hip hop. Plenty of booths for bottle service."}
{"text":"We came here at the end of an impromptu bar crawl. The drinks were okay, sampling an old fashion and mule. These were not the best drinks we had all day, in comparison.   What impressed me the most were the wings, which were quite delicious! The sauce is made in house. I was hesitant when the bartender told me there was no blue cheese dipping sauce to go on the side, but these wings didn't need it.  Overall, I was hoping the drinks might be a little better, but they were fine and the wings were great!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed with my visit here as the quality has declined since I've last been. I came during their happy hour and was not impressed. The good, nice ambiance and strong drinks. The bad, service was very slow, food took over an hour to come out and when ordering, it turned out multiple items on the menu were not available. $15 for what tasted like a frozen pizza. Overall, just come for drinks and don't bother with the food."}
{"text":"Cool space. DJ was fantastic!! Food was just ok; service was pretty great.  Three stars because it took 25 minutes to walk 300 ft to a washroom. They need to address that. Crowd was meh. I'd go back again with my girlfriends because the music was that great."}
{"text":"Such a cool place for the mature crowd! Staff are really friendly too!  HUGE drinks menu and bartender can help u figure out what you want if you are unsure.  There is no cover and it doesn't seem to get very busy later on so you 'll be able to get in with no issues.  It's not near the entertainment district so less crowded. Overall better music too!"}
