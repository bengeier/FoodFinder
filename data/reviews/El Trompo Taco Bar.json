{"text":"Went on a weeknight and was treated to great service and delicious food.

tiny and really packed, but we were served quickly. the margaritas were great with not too much tequila, and the fish tacos were awesome! fresh and filling considering there were only two and they were quite small.

i definitely plan on coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Probably the closest thing you can get to \"real\" Mexican food in Toronto.  I really like this restaurant and I'm a regular here.  The people are always friendly and the food is always awesome.  My favorites are the tacos el pastor and tinga chicken."}
{"text":"We've come here at least once a month for the past eight months, so I can claim to know a few things about El Trompo. 

Can I tell you if it's authentic? Nope. But the the tacos are consistently good and the quality of the ingredients is excellent -- fresh and yummy. The guacamole is stick-your-face-in-the-bowl delicious, and the service is fast and super pleasant. We'll keep coming back over and over."}
{"text":"The closest you'll get to Mexico without leaving Toronto, El Trompo is one of my favorite places to lunch on Sunday afternoons.  I almost always get the Quesongos (mushroom tacos) because they are just so damn good --sauteed mushrooms topped with creamy queso fresco and spiked with cilantro.  That hit of freshness sings in your mouth as the tastes and textures harmonize.  

Because I have trouble veering away from the tacos, I usually convince my dining companion to order something else so that we can share.  Enter, Veggie Alambres!  These make your own tacos are actually cheaper than the pre-made and come with eight small tortillas to use as vessels for the succulent goodness of sauteed peppers, onions, and pineapple that sizzle under their coating of cheese.

I find that the tacos alone aren't enough to fill me up so starting with guacamole and chips is highly encouraged.  In fact, once you taste El Trompo's guac, your taste buds will demand that you order it every time.

The interior of the restaurant is small but cozy and the warm, cheerful staff will make you feel right at home.  In the winter a trip to El Trompo is a comforting reminder that Spring is just around the corner, plus it's easier to get a table.  Once summer rolls around, there is no better way to enjoy some fine company on a sunny day than washing down some guac and tacos with a bottle of Sol.  But you'll have to wait for a table because everyone else in the city has caught on."}
{"text":"I was buying corn tortillas at the Mexican grocer down the street and asked if he would recommend a lunch spot. He said that he also owned El Trompo and that his wife was cooking there. I went.

The guacamole was very tasty, the red and green salsas were delicious, although not for the faint of heart. My vegetarian foods actually vegetarian (it's been a thing) and full of flavour. The service was friendly, the patio cheerful and the food good."}
{"text":"best in city, shady neighbourhood at night. Not cali or mexico quality but good basic Chiccarone de queso killer!"}
{"text":"wandered in this place while walking around Kennsington Market.

I ordered the house special \"Pork Taco's\".

Very authentic. just like being in mexico. I got five small tacos (with lots of meat filling) for $10, plus a beer.

Great little place."}
{"text":"Solid 3.

Good value.  Tasty tacos.  Nothing special.  I had the chorizo and I found the whole thing a little dry.  Obviously the meat was premade and just heated up and assembled.  They made the whole thing in 5 min.

5 tacos for $11 incl tax.  Not bad.  I'd go back for a snack. Not a go to must go kind of place.  

Good amount of seating inside."}
{"text":"What can I say? EVERYTHING is good here: the guac, the el pastor, the tinga, the mole, it's got variety and soooo well prepared I dont mind the price (cheaper than a flight to mexico !). Their Sunday Pazole soup is amazing: you can get that, and a taco plate for a good deal. Mmmm... Salivating just writing this! And it's licensed!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place after reading the many glowing reviews and as a lover of great fish tacos. Only to be thoroughly disappointed by a very underwhelming meal.

Went on a quiet Thursday evening and had the fish tacos and their specialty alambre de pastor pork tacos. The service was decent and the food arrived quickly. 

The fish tacos were on the expensive size for the portion at $5 dollars for a two bite taco. The double taco wraps were very dry and stale as was the fish, which was cold and tasted liked it was old and had been reheated. Similar experience with the al pastor tacos, the flavor was good but the pork was tough and chewy and there was barely any garnish. 

Maybe a hit or miss with this place depending on when you go and who's cooking, but from my experience I would not go back."}
{"text":"Authentic food! It makes you feel like you are in Mexico! I always like to come and loveeee the guacamole as well as the al pastor! Today I was surprised by new items on the menu and decided to try their new fish tacos and delicious cactus salad! So far the best fish tacos in Toronto as well as gluten free, which is a bonus!

I will definetely keep going back and hopefully in a few days enjoy the patio."}
{"text":"for authentic tacos, this is a good place to go.   the tortillas are home made.
we have gone twice for the chongos zamoramos and they didn't have theme. the tres leches is ok, the orchata tasted like milk for almost $4.00;  the salsa roja and salsa verde are complementary (and good) but then you have to buy the chips (which doesn't make sense
the tacos al pastor are good, the quesongo (mushroom and cheese taco) very delicious.
The service is good, and fast, my only complaint will be the prices for desserts and drinks."}
{"text":"I got the Al Pastor tacos here and they were pretty bland. Didn't taste like much aside from a bite of cilantro. The service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Real Mexican food in a central location with an interesting street-front patio.

I had pastor tacos, which were the real deal, pineapple and all. The salsas are tasty, though their pico de gallo, while good, seemed like the tomatoes could have been a little riper (this is a minor issue). Ten dollars for tacos is a bit much (there is at least one better value to be found in this city), but I'll pay ten bucks to get the real thing."}
{"text":"Some locals recommended this spot for the tacos--fun hole-in-the-wall spot (my favorite) with super friendly staff and very fast service. We had the Al Pastor tacos, guac and margaritas. Hit the spot on a hot day! It's a smaller space with some outdoor seating so be prepared for close quarters and a noisier environment."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food I've had in Toronto. The Al Pastor tacos here are amazing!  I'm not a pineapple fan, but it brings such a nice flavour to the pork.  My margarita and churro were meh, but it doesn't really matter, because tacos are what it's all about here!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is so good it's so simple, there's nothing complicated about it but it's got such a very complicated flavor. So many flavors mixed in together and complement each other and add to a very South and Central American experience.

The service was very good, you can tell that it's a family-run restaurant that are truly Mexican. They take your order promptly and the food seems to appear within seconds!

Everything on the menu is delicious, although you have to try their specialty."}
{"text":"Ughhh so hard to stop. 

We get the fish tacos. 
Ease yourself in with one or two. Then say you'll only have another, so you order a third. Then a fourth. Maybe a fifth. At this point, you are super full and you crave more, but force yourself to stop. 

Service is super fast, and the ladies working there are lovely. We went a few times in the summer and it is so nice to sit outside on the kitschy patio area and down taco after another. It is a little crowded on the inside and tends to be super full on most weeknights. 

Additionally, the pico de gallo is amazing and so are the chips they serve it with."}
{"text":"Well...really 4.5.

Lets break it down:
The restaurant is a hole in the wall. Its tiny, HOT, and sticky. So don't expect the Ritz. The atmosphere, I personally think is charming. Afterall, these are authentic mexican street tacos so, its nice to be served by mexican waitresses and it not be too fancy. Street food at its best.

My husband and his friends all had the al pastor which was really good. Distinctive flavors. I had the spicy chicken which was prettttyyyy good. Those hot sauces they give you are amazing.

The portion sizes are cool for the price. You get 5 small (this isn't taco bell) tacos for 10$. Margaritas were good (get the lime). BUT the churros were cold and unappetizing. That's where they lost 0.5.

So go, get the food and go get your churros down the street.

THUMBS UP!"}
{"text":"I wanted to give El Trompo a good review but just couldn't. 

We had read many good reviews on it and decided to check it out. The service was great and as vegetarians we tried the mushroom taco's. I'd suggest they take these off the menu. The mushroom taco's were just a ball of grease and left us both sick. I'm sure the meat options are fine from what we have read but vegetarians beware."}
{"text":"This was our first visit here. The food was nice and the tacos were really good. We enjoyed the guacamole however the nacho portion could have been a little bigger for the price. The 3 different taco plates we ordered came with one slice of lime. Which I feel was small they should have been at least 2 pieces of lime for the 5 tacos on each order. And we recommend that you try the mango margaritas cause they were very refreshing."}
{"text":"This is one joint where I wished I ate meat!
almost everything on the menu is chicken, beef or pork. 

To start off, the chips and salsa are yummmmm. I got the jamaica tea which was not cold enough but still good instead of pop. The table i.e. the people sitting at it ordered the mixed fajitas (chicken and  beef) and melted cheese with mushrooms on top. They fajitas looked incredible and apparently tasted just as good. 

I got one of the only vegetarian options on the menu: onion and mushroom tacos which is exactly what it sounds like. Sauteed onions and mushrooms in tiny corn tortillas. Garnished with some cheese and salsa it was definetely better than a salad (not sure if they even have those)

The food portions are large enough to share. Forgot to try the guac so will have to go back for it.

If youre dining inside the restaurant, dont plan to attend any intimate gatherings afterwards since that yummy mexican smell holds on for dear life."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food here. Although I have no idea what authentic Mexican tastes like, if I had to imagine, this would not be far off.

This is my fav Mexican in Toronto. The salsa is delicious. The atmosphere appeals to me too, even with an ATM front and centre in the restaurant.

Only downside, no Sangria."}
{"text":"Last of the Toronto reviews, I promise!  Good grief, I didn't expect to find great Mexican food north of the border, let alone the Canadian border, but this, my friends, is the real deal.   The tacos al pastor (five little silver-dollar tacos to a plate) were perfectly seasoned, served with a little pico de gallo.  The sauces are authentic and taste exactly like they should, not surprising as the owners are from Puebla, Mexico.  Dirt cheap and washed down with an ice-cold Dos Equis (or two), it was probably the best culinary experience I had in Toronto.  No wonder the place is jam-packed.  Every Mexican restaurant owner in New York should book a flight on Porter today.  Come to Ontario and learn from these people!"}
{"text":"Went on a friday night. Server's were super friendly and let me practice my spanish without laughing at me. I had the Alhambre fajitas and my buddy got the 5 tacos for 10$ deal. the fajitas were a few dollars more but well worth it. a nice size place of meat veggies and cheese with 8 little fajita shells for scooping in. 

my friend said the tacos were tasty but it wasn't alot of food for us big boys. we ended up eating about an hour later. this has nothing to do with the level of taste or service however, we're just big guys who need alot of food to fill up.

service was quick, food was very tasty and the price is right (30 for the two of us, no booze). I'll definitely go check it out again when I need that mexican feel."}
{"text":"Authentic huevos rancheros, damn tasty coffee and simple salsas are all great reasons to try the brunch here. Super warm & welcoming servers. Its Mexican comfort food.."}
{"text":"Food was good, not great, to me but I'm not a huge Mexican food fan. What did it for me was the really chillin patio, and the great guacamole. It seems everyone at El Trompo has one, which is usually a good indication that you should too!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and love their tacos each and every time. 

This time was no exception... Except service was a little slow considering we were the only other table there besides another couple. The waitress ignored us for quite a while and two other waitresses were busy talking amongst themselves at a nearby table. We had a hard time flagging a waitress down given how empty the place was at the time. 

I like how the decor is vibrant and loud. It feels very upbeat and fun. The place can sit quite a number of people but can get a little crammed if the place is packed depending on the time of day. 

The tacos are delicious. Can never go wrong with Al Pastor or Tinga. For the price there is enough to go around and share with others. This time we tried the tamale, the cheese one was cheesy and yummy. But the meat one was bland and was nothing outstanding."}
{"text":"Very busy place in Kensington for a reason. Not a fancy place. Just honest food prepared the authentic way. Staff are very friendly regardless of how busy they are. I had the pico de gallo and Taco di lingua. So good. Again. Nothing fancy or fusion. Just straight good real Mexican tacos. Perfect with a beer on the patio. Will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Always great authentic food,  environment, and excellent customer service.  Also a super fast lunch."}
{"text":"This is a nice little mexican joint that my bro introduced to me and I decided to bring my gf on our Kensington food stuffing day!!!

You can tell which establishment really stands out when some are PACKED! And some are just empty...

To give the servers credit, there's only 2 of them running sooo many tables and constantly moving, I commend them on doing a super job!

Luckily even the patio and inside joint was packed when we were there, but there was one table right beside the kitchen which we sat down to.

Since we ate so much already, we just got two things to give my gf a sample of.

The Guacamole + Chips ($7). While this may be a bit expensive for an app, its actually a deal, because you actually get great quality and taste. Fresh guacamole, onions, tomatoes and a hint of jalapenoes. Nice and Rich to eat in a hot summer day!!!

Second dish: Spicy Tinga Chicken...Not spicy at all, but the flavours are there. It kind of reminded me of a chinese soup 'ABC' carrots, tomato, potato, and meat... You get 5 mini taco's which is cool for the price of $9.75!

We were quite interested in purchasing their bowls for the guacamole dip b/c its so light and handy. 

Funny thing: I asked the server how much the bowls cost them in Mexico, she said, $1 Peso! And I asked how much they sell it here in Canada? $4 CDN!!!

Last time I checked Canadian currency is A LOT greater than Mexican.

Next time maybe try something new..."}
{"text":"I like how the tacos are served - small and multiple. Prefer guacamole that has more texture but it still hits the spot."}
{"text":"A friend recommended it. Maybe we were there on a bad day. Quesadillas were so-o-o-o bland, just a slab of cheap mozzarella in two tortillas. Tacos were ok, but I make better at home. Guacamole again was bland and unimpressive, I make it often at home and put so much more soul into it. Plastic used up plates and glasses did not add to the experience either. Yes, it was very inexpensive, but I'd rather pay more for better food. I guess the main point of this restaurant is their cheap prices and well, the food is fresh, albeit nothing special."}
{"text":"Excellent local place for Mexican, Alambras had great flavour and lots of sauce, the tacos we tried mushroom and all pastor and both were good, great value also. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"3 stars and that's generous. Waited 20 minutes for a table for a party of three, when we finally got the table the staff asked if we were willing to take a small table instead. The food is OKAY for the prices being charged and portions are not great. Fajitas taste more Asian-inspired than Mexican with a lingering spike of soy-sauce infused sodium. Kind of disappointed, won't go back unless it is a last resort."}
{"text":"An excellent, authentic Mexican restaurant in the heart of Toronto's Kensington Market.  

To start, El Trompo creates its own tortillas in its basement.  The tacos are their specialy: Served will small, light tortillas, tasty marinated meats and topped with cilantro and onions.  They also serve traditional Mexican drinks like Horchatas.  To clog your arteries, try the Queso de Chicharon (fried cheese).

The place is small, tight and cozy.  The wait staff is efficient and friendly.  There's a nice little patio spot during the summer.

El Trompo does not serve Tex Mex food.  They proudly offer authenticity and they're rewarded by a loyal Mexican ex-pat customer base.  Give it a go if you're looking for super casual, no frills authentic Mexican grub.  Go to Taco Bell if you want the super-sized stuff."}
{"text":"Reminiscent of street food I've had in California from Mexican taco trucks.  Except at 5 times the price.  But hey, this is Toronto, and you'll be hard pressed to find tacos as good anywhere else, and certainly not much cheaper.  

Everything you'd expect at a taqueria. Corn tortillas, home made salsas, guacamole.  My favourite here are the 'El Pastor' style pork and  pineapple.  Nice place for some authentic Mexican in the Market.  Salud!"}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by asserting that I am an expert in authentic mexican cuisine. I grew up a burrito toss from the Mexican border so I know legitimacy when I taste it. This place is not bad for being 3000 miles from anything actually Mexican but it's not great either. Their tacos are freakishly small and make me feel like I have giant hands. However this place definitely doesn't offer any of the tex-mex bullsh*t that most people call mexican food. Its overpriced but the kensington location and nice patio almost make up for it. 

The grilled chicken tacos are OK but the meat is chopped so finely its like dog kibble. My amigo had the beef fajitas which looked pretty legit."}
{"text":"Unbelievably delicious. The pico de gallo is easily shared by 4 and you can get extra chips if needed (at no extra fee). I found the 5(!) tacos you get to be plenty of food.  Service was quick but you don't feel rushed. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Great tacos, excellent patio, and I love dropping by just to pick up a jamaica or tamarindo on a hot day. Their tacos are almost exactly like ones you get in Mexico, their guacamole is flawless. Whenever I come to Kensington, it's always a toss-up whether to go to El Trompo or Seven Lives!"}
{"text":"Really awesome authentic Mexican food at really reasonable prices.

Bonus: Your order will arrive really quickly.

Double bonus: The fried cheese chip things are delicious.

Wash your mean down with a (tamarind) Jarrito and if you miss the southern US / Mexico at all, you'll feel a little better, until your meal is digested and you get homesick again."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food i've eaten outside of Mexico.   i've lived in Mexico City, and El Trompo's 'Tacos Al Pastor' are very similar to what you can find on the streets of D.F.  
This is not tex-mex (which many canadians and americans are used to)... this is real mexican food.   There are a few good Mexican/Latin places in Kensington Market, but this is the best for Tacos al Pastor for sure.

If you are brave, ask the waitress to bring you the habenero salsa!  Very spicy!    

I'll be back here many times!"}
{"text":"I am actually wanting to give it a four stars, or even five stars...As you can see, this review might involve some of my personal opinions. Firstly, I came to the place today at 11:30. The patio was almost full so we decided to sit inside. Then came to food.
1. The guacamole was absolutely a must! 5/5 (even though I was not a huge fan of Mexican foods, but I am a huge fan of avocado...)
2. Al Pastor Tacos: 4/5(5.5/5 for authenticity prove) I had to admit that the tacos were really good. However, after eating I couldn't be impressed. Maybe the portion wasn't as adequate as photos other people showed; maybe I still need time to get used of these delicious authentic Mexican foods.
3. The pollo Fijitas: Similar.4/5 The chicken and pepper stir fry with 8 tortillas. The food was delicious. However I could really cook the stir fry by my own. That's probably why El Trompo did not attract me after this meal
Overall, in my opinion( with very limited knowledge and experience for Mexican foods) you will love the restaurant if you love Mexican foods. Otherwise, you might have the similar thought."}
{"text":"Everything smelled homemade! The fajitas were dynamite! Overall the place makes you feel like you're in a small town in Mexico. Very homey and welcoming, the music was good, food is served hot and fresh and the beer was cheap! 

Service with a smile :) This spot is definitely a keeper."}
{"text":"4/5! Amazing food! Love the guacamole. Authentic and fresh :)"}
{"text":"This place is more proof that almost any place in this city with a west-facing patio and a liquor licence will get a steady stream of customers. The food is not too bad but not good enough imo to justify its popularity - especially with so many better (and cheaper!) Mexican options so close by. Example: fajitas are pretty bland and reminiscent of cheap tex-mex. 

It's a bit overpriced for the quality, has very few veggie options (which may of course not be a deal breaker for many folks) and ambience and service is kinda lacking. Meh overall."}
{"text":"I am in love with this place.

I didn't realize how authentic the food was here until I spent time in California and Mexico.

My wife and I usually pop in here on a weekend and have a light lunch, splitting an order of street-food-style tacos, guacamole, and a pair of Jarrito sodas.

Afterwards, I may head down the street for a fresh churro."}
{"text":"The portions are tiny and the food is overpriced for what you get. For two people and including two beers the meal came to $50 ( which would have been ok for generous portions but my husband was still hungry after that. ) I had the mushroom tacos and all you could taste was soy sauce. Not authentic Mexican flavours, even the beef dish tasted like it had MSG in it. So in the end - a fast food quality meal. I wouldn't go back, even if it were free. Unfortunately, because our waitress was very nice, which is why I am giving it two stars instead of one."}
{"text":"Tacos al pastor was awesome, fast friendly service, definitely the best tacos in Toronto hands down!"}
{"text":"Good food, great service what's not to like. 

The decor seems like it was taken straight out of Mexico. I've never been to Mexico but this seems to be pretty close. 

Their fresh pico de gallo was awesome. Wouldn't mind going back just for that."}
{"text":"I ended up at this small Mexican restaurant as part of Toronto area \"tweetup\". The #GuacoTO crowd arrived on what had to be one of the hottest nights so far this summer! We were all in the mood for authentic Mexican, so the heat played right into the theme.  At least that's what we told ourselves!

The taste and quality of the food was exactly what I have come to expect when eating true Mexican food.  The guacamole was fresh and full of chunky veggies.  The pico de galo was glistening with the look of veggies freshly washed and chopped.

I chose the Al Pastor Tacos, which are a favourite of mine and the specialty of the house.  The flavour of the tacos was outstanding! Personally, I added some of the Salsa Verde that was on the table to my tacos and they were over the top! I also had the opportunity to try the Chorizo (which is made fresh at the restaurant) Tacos. They too were amazing.

The staff were courteous and kept our drinks and nacho baskets full all night.  There was also a mariachi group that came and played a few songs for us while we ate!

If you are in the Kensington area and are a fan of authentic, made from scratch cooking, this place needs to be on your list! Try it, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Nice little hidden place. Good food but nothing to die for. I had the Spicy Tinga Chicken which was exactly as described ~ spicy. They have their own chips which must be had. The service was quick but as a university student I found the final bill to be steep."}
{"text":"The reviews at our table were a bit mixed, but I enjoyed the food here - it's authentic, tasty and you get a decent amount for the price.

My wife and I each had the al pastor (\"Mexico-city style tacos\" - pork, pineapple coriander, onion) and were big fans, largely because of the authenticity. If you prefer Tex-Mex to the real thing (first, what is wrong with you), you may be a bit underwhelmed because these dishes aren't about hot sauce and sour cream.

The service was good and quick - it took about ten minutes to get our food on a busy night. This place always seems to be hopping, as there was a line at the door when we left.

Most of the customers were young couples, although one or two tables had one or two kids. The place is laid back, fun and cramped.

Along with two beers, one horcahta (a drink made with rice, vanilla, cinnamon and milk - tastes better than it sounds), a tip and taxes, the bill came to just under $40."}
{"text":"To me this is the best place to get tacos in Toronto (much better than El Asador). While the quality here does not quite match the best tacos you can get in Cali, they are nevertheless very good (regardless of what city) and stand on their own merit. 

To me the three best tacos are the al pastor, chorizo, and tinga in that order. The steak tacos are also very good. House made guacamole is solid but missing a little something (possibly some extra salt?). 

Red and Green sauces at the table are very flavourful and both pack good heat. Corn tortillas are soft and fresh. 

Tamarindo, Horchata and Jamaica juices are all very good and worth getting in place of beer or soda. 

One downside is the lack of A/C in the summer (although being a taco joint this is kind of par for the course) which means be prepared to sweat while eating if you can't get a seat on the patio (whatever, it's worth it). 

In short, I go here at least once a month when ever I need to fix a taco craving."}
{"text":"I've been to Mexico once during a spring break trip back in my student days, our comfort food after the bars were authentic tacos from small little shops sitting over the cliffs of the Pacific Ocean. They always hit the spot and this place definitely takes me back, however the only difference is the price. I don't remember mexican fare being so expensive, my date and I both ordered an entree, shared the guacamole, and we both had an adult beverage...$45 with a generous tip. Not on my cheap eats list but i'm fan of their food."}
{"text":"I have come here twice and I will continue to come here whenever I stop by Kensington! A great little Mexican stop with amazing tacos. The Al Pastor tastes very authentic and has a nice sweetness from the pineapple.
It can get a little busy but it's worth the wait. The price point is pretty decent as well. 
 A must try! :)"}
{"text":"I love, love, love this place. Their guac is amazing, and their grilled chicken + Al Pastor tacos are unreal. Nothing is better on a summer Sunday in the market, than people watching and curing your hangover with their brunch special and a side of grilled chicken tacos. Of course, a cold Tecate is needed. Go now. And say hi to their amazing owner!! She is honestly the sweetest lady and takes so much pride in what comes out of her kitchen."}
{"text":"Try the real tacos so you can see the difference with these ones.
They suck, they do not taste well, over spicy and they are not the real deal and I cannot believe some people say they are the best tacos in the city, plss"}
{"text":"Had dinner here on a Friday night with my fiance.  Had been wanting to get some good tacos ever since we had some not so great tacos at another Toronto establishment.

El Trompo is nothing fancy, but the food was great - and came out very quickly after ordering.  Had the nachos & guacamole (excellent) and the Al Pastor tacos - very tasty.

Would def come back again and try some more stuff off their menu."}
{"text":"Wayyyy overpriced. Got 5 very tiny tacos that were nothing special for $10, and a small quesadilla for $5 -- tasted okay, but nothing special and was still hungry afterwards and had to eat again.

Won't be going back."}
{"text":"A perfect place to stop during an afternoon of shopping in Kensington. Always busy. Decor is mediocre but the salsa and guacamole are the best! The staff is friendly and the margaritas are so yummy!"}
{"text":"I used to sit on the sidelines, watching Zack S mow down a plate (or sometimes 2) of these famous El Pastor tacos. He would moan and glisten with sweat and tremble slightly. I now realize this sounds like I'm describing the symptoms of food poisoning, but it's because he was in food bliss.

One day I decided to join in on the fun. I ordered the Quesongo  (mushroom) tacos, which come nestled together like 5 wee bear cubs my plate. And then I destroyed them. 

The guacamole is decent, but the tacos - based on my experience and Zack S' - are to kill for. I had tacos at a different place last night and wanted to throw my plate off a bridge in disgust. It's not that they were inedible - they just paled in comparison. 

So, 5 stars based on one plate. All you need is a moment to know that you're in love."}
{"text":"You know what kind of place this is? this is the place you go to with your friends/boyfriend after you've had an insane week/day and you just want to sit on the patio, feel the breeze on your face, enjoy the margarita in the huge glass and thoroughly enjoy the tacos al pastor, chicken tinga, guacamole, pico de gallo and just keep eating because it's awesome. This is a super unpretentious, super tacky menu with photos kind of place and that's what makes it so great. 

Best visited in the summer because of the aforementioned patio. The fact that this is in Kensington market makes the vibe really laid back (even though it already is, but imagine more laid back-ness) and chilled and somehow adds to the flavour of the tacos. This isn't the glitzy new mexican deconstructed taco restaurant, it's just simple and pretty delicious (and messy) good food. 

This place may have failed a health inspection at a certain point but I believe it's been around for a while and they know what they're doing behind that small prep counter so get your taco on!"}
{"text":"Your better off getting tacos at taco bell. This place sucks. The tacos were horrible. I got the chicken tacos. The meat didn't look or taste like chicken. Idk what it was. The quesadilla was suppose to be two tortillas filled with chicken and veggies. It was basically one big taco which was weird. The margaritas were horrible. They were served warm and we're horribly made. I will never go back to this place. Its pretty bad Mexican food."}
{"text":"Absolutely my favourite authentic Mexican restaurant in the city! 

Everything is always fresh and delicious. I've gotten into the habit of ordering the same thing once a week and I'm totally ok with that. To start, their crazy-good house-made guacamole with the unbelievable nachos. These nachos are not the typical cheese-loaded, super salsa'ed typical bar nachos but nice and light with refried beans, a bit of cheese and pico de gallo. I always get the quesongo tacos (mushroom with cheese) and squeeze some salsa verde on top. (Again, house-made and soooo good!) My partner loves the tacos pastor. 

My partner is from Mexico City and knows a great taco place when he sees one and I am so pleased he introduced me to such a gem in our city. Like, I said, we go once a a week and we will continue to do so. Love the food, love the place, love the servers. Not a single complaint!"}
{"text":"So I went here tonight for dinner and I have to say - I'm a total convert! 

I'm vegan, and have never been a huge fan of Mexican food, but this place really blew my mind. My partner is from Texas, and knows good authentic Mexican food when he tastes/sees it, and this is his favourite Mexican place in Toronto by far. 

For all my fellow vegans out there - the staff here is very friendly and has no problem pointing out the vegan menu items. This will probably just be guac + corn chips (BEST guac I have ever had), the veggie quesadilla sans cheese, and then something else veggietacular that I can't quite remember. Whatever it is, it'll be badass, trust me. 

Prompt service, delish food, and free unending corn chip refills! Hells yes! They even gave us some more for the road! 

I really love the family vibe of this place. The food is made fresh, clearly homemade, no frozen/processed bullshit. It's light and healthy, not greasy and oily and heavy as some restaurants are. You won't come out of this place feeling sluggish and like you need to take a nap/sit for the rest of the evening. 

For 2 people it was ~$45 including tip, but we came home with leftovers of everything we ordered, which has already lasted me one snack, and will probably last another meal or two for each of us. You do get a decent amount of food! I'll definitely be coming back here... and often!"}
{"text":"While surfing around Kensington market on a lazy Sunday afternoon, I feel like grabbing some tacos for snack.  I usually go to Seven Lives but after seeing the crazy lineup there, decide to take a shot on other places.  Come to El Trompo as per friend's recommendation.  Since it is my first time here and I don't really what makes a authentic taco, so decide to go for El pastor house special.  The taste is ok... To be honest not as good as I expect, pork tends to be on the dry side so really needs lots of green salsa and hot sauce to go with it.  Ambiance is small yet cosy and the wait staff is friendly and attentive.  It is a small place anyway so shouldn't have any issue of getting service.  They also have a small patio seating so it'll be nice to have beer with friends while tasting some Mexican snacks.  The portion tends to be light for me, probably better if they serve some sides with it.  I think the price tends to be high for a snack.  I'd like to try it again but since my favour taco place is a few steps away, don't see that happening anytime soon."}
{"text":"Went to El Trompo this past weekend. Quite a sunny Saturday evening. Wanted to get a patio seat but it was about a 20-30 minute wait. Patio looked like it was about 10 seats at most where as the inside could fit about 20-30 seats. Very authentic as the employees spoke Spanish in comparison to imagining most taco/burrito places in Toronto would speak english. I ordered the nachos w/guac and the Al Pastor tacos. The guac was 7 dollars for a small bowl however it was the freshest guac that I've ever had in my life. Each order of tacos comes in 5 and you could tell the tortillas were made in-house as they tasted very fresh. Order came very quickly as it came within 5 minutes. One thing to mention is that they only take Visa/Debit if you ordered more than 10 dollars. Overall amazing and authentic spot especially for the value."}
{"text":"Highly recommended. Fast, tasty, good prices. It's small & basic, but cozy. Friendly & attentive staff."}
{"text":"Good and authentic mexican food, a bit expensive for my pocket"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and must recommend.  We ordered the guac and the al pastor tacos.  While the tacos probably won't fill a single person with an above average appetite for dinner, it was the right size for lunch. Besides, the pork was nicely seasoned, the pineapple worked really well with it, and was great with the chipotle salsa they provided at the table (not as good with the verde...).  The guac was smooth and delicious.   The great thing about this place is the salsas they give you at the table pull no punches, they're actually spicy (a little spicy though, nothing that'll make your nose run). 

Can't wait to try this place for brunch!"}
{"text":"I came here last year with a friend and we ordered guacamole, pozole and 3 varieties of tacos. Was super satisfied then and am still super satisfied now! I wish half stars existed because I'd give this place 4.5 stars. 

Brought my 2 cousins and my brother for a late lunch on Friday. The patio was full so we got a seat inside. I ordered the al pastor tacos ($9.75/5), cousin got the chicken tinga tacos ($9.75/5), my brother got the sincronizada hawaiiana quesadilla ($4.99/4pcs) and we shared an order of nachos ($3.99). The food came very quickly which we even joked about being too fast haha! The tacos came first then the quesadilla a couple minutes later. I loved the pineapple in the al pastor tacos because it really complimented the pork. My cousin thought his tinga tacos were tender and juicy too so that's a good sign. 

Unfortunately, my brothers first experience wasn't as awesome as I remember mine. His quesadilla was really bland and sad looking. It had a couple slices of ham, cheese and pineapple chunks in it and was barely grilled. The nachos were mediocre and got soggy very quickly because of the pico de gallo. I found out later that ours had no refried beans!! I'd recommend ordering the pico de gallo on its own for the same price which comes with chips on the side to avoid sogginess if you don't plan on eating the whole thing right away. 

One thing I love about El Trompo is their simplistic approach to food that doesn't lack flavour. Everything tasted really fresh. Service was fast, efficient and servers are very friendly. I do highly recommend this place but perhaps you should avoid the quesadillas."}
{"text":"Small little place. Great service. Love the al pastor tacos(pork chop pieces, pineapple, onions). Good guacamole: creamy and onion-y.

My only complain: The food can use a little spiciness. That is just my preference...I like it spicy!"}
{"text":"Delicious and reasonably priced tacos! The pork ones are especially good. Great for Mexican food when you don't want Tex-Mex or giant portions covered in shredded cheese. Not especially fancy inside, but the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"Nice little hole in the wall spot where you would ecpect the food to be great but... not so much.

Being Mexican I can say that the tacos are way too small and although a taco in Toronto will never taste the same as it does in Mexico, they are not as close as they could be. They did have a good guacamole though.

I prefer salsal which is about 30 seconds south of this one."}
{"text":"Like I always say, great mexican is hard to comeby in Toronto but El Trompo steps it up in the taco category. These are probably the best, authentic tacos you can find in the city. The veggie mushroom tacos are so flavourful and the al pastors are fantastic. The guacamole is delicious as well. Keep it simple and get the tacos."}
{"text":"Nice traditional-style restaurant, and their special - five tacos and a bean soup for $10.50 - is a decent deal. However, I found it underwhelming compared to Mexican Salsas down the street, which despite sadly having no outdoor seating, puts together a much tastier taco (on tastier corn tortillas) for a substantially lower price."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restarants. It's friendly and fast and authentic. The pico de gallo is brilliant and the tacos are tasty and fresh."}
{"text":"Stopped by after a long school day with a friend because we wanted to try something new. No regrets. The restaurant itself is tiny I can't say if there are usually long waits or not as I have only been there once. I got a very \"at-home\" vibe from sitting in the restaurant, legit felt like I was in Mexico :p

There were many options to choose from on the menu, I decided on the generic Spicy Chicken tacos.
The service was extremely friendly and helpful as I had no idea what to expect since i've never actually ordered authentic Mexican tacos before. The wait for our food wasn't too long, we waited maybe 10 minutes or so which is ideal. The tacos were just delicious- the pulled chicken was soft and full of so much flavour! It wasn't as spicy as I had anticipated but it's great that  they have two hot sauces on the table for you to choose from to add  into your tacos. The price was very reasonable for its portions, it may not look much if you go in ready to eat an arm and leg but trust me that it is quite filling. We also got the chips and guac because I love trying out good guacamole. I only wish that it had a little bit more of a lime kick to it but it was overall still creamy and tasty! 

All in all, I would definitely come back here as the food and service was pretty top-knotch. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Nice lil Mexican food joint in Kengsington. The decor is super bright, colorful and lively. The food is also flavorful. We got the nachos to start with a couple margaritas. The margaritas were awful. We tried them both frozen and on the rocks and were totally dissappointed. I can make better Margs at home! 

For the main course, we got the Al Pastor and Chorizo tacos and a chicken quesadilla. For the price, the size of these dishes was really small. We closed our meal with a dessert that was some sort of tres leches. The dessert was rich and well made.

The overall service was quite nice. Everyone was super quick and helpful."}
{"text":"Worst. Mexican food. Ever. 

And I hate to post this review because the staff seemed nice, but I have to because it was due to all of the great reviews posted here that made me hungrily but happily anticipate the first good Mexican food I've had here in Canada.

Well. First of all you must know that I am extremely picky about Mexican food because I was born and raised in California and my grandparents lived in Mexico, so I grew up eating it all the time. That being said, I expected at least greater variety, bigger portions and better tasting food based on the prices. For example, I don't eat too much meat but usually you can substitute beans for meat, and you can pick what type of beans or sauces, etc. Not so here, so that left my vegetarian friend and I with few options. We ordered guacamole, which was decent but overpriced. He ordered the Huitlacoche, some sort of a small mushroom confection that he thought was awful and quickly slurped down in a few bites using half my beer. I ordered the Pollito, which resembled small bits of dog food placed on a flat tortilla. It tasted okay, but I couldn't believe there wasn't more food! We both scarfed down an overpriced side order of refried beans with the chips to try to compensate. I left with an empty wallet and a stomach ache that still hurts as I type this. Might as well save the money and go to Taco Bell.

And to the Reviewer Grant C. from New York City, who raved about this place, you ought to try Castro's near Bed Stuy in Brooklyn for AMAZING Mexican food, to see what it really tastes like."}
{"text":"Seemed pretty Mexican to me.

Popped in for a huevos rancheros with chorizo for breakfast. It came with coffee, some pico de gallo, re-fried beans, and five warm tortillas to make little tacos as I saw fit. 

It was prompt, spicy as I wanted it (by way of the bowls of sauce sitting on the tables - recycled for everyone who sat there - a little unsanitary for my standards, but again, I assume it's sort of Mexican). 

All that for 9$ including tax and tip. Not too shabby. Although it doesn't look like it - they also accept plastic."}
{"text":"I was really, really looking forward to eating here. I love mexican food, not the tex-mex, americanised \"mexican\" food,but the real thing. After having spent some time driving through Mexico this year, and eating lots of authentic mexican food, I came back to Canada craving to relieve my experiences, but there are very few places where a girl can quench her taco cravings in this city. 
We were a party of four,( me and the bf, and another couple)  and It was very busy when we arrived, but there was still a patio table available so we grabbed it. We were then ignored by the waitstaff for about 10 mins. I finally flagged the waitress down and asked if we could have some menus, which she brought out. Like other reviews have stated, the prices are steep for tacos, and we were starving, so we knew that five little tacos weren't gonna do it for us. 
We got five tacos each, a mix of chorizo,al pastor and pollo tinga. We also got the guacamole and pico de gallo to share. Our companions got the chuleta con queso tacos, and the chuleta tacos respectively. We also got a chicken tinga quesadilla each, because like I said, we were starving. The guac was awesome, with little chunks of onion and tomato throughout, the pico de gallo was a bit spicy and really fresh. The tacos were good, I really enjoyed the al pastor, and my companion prefered the chorizo and thought the al pastor were a little dry for his taste. The chicken tinga tacos were meh. I was expecting better, and was sadly dissapointed. Our friends both liked their tacos, and the chuleta con queso looke really good and goey. The chiken tinga quesadilla was fine, but again we were not impressed by it.  We finished the meal off with their mango cheesecake, and it was delicious. 
The whole meal came to $75, before tip. So, yeah a little too steep for what should really be cheap, street food.
The main reason why they lost 2 stars though, was the service. Like I said earlier we were ignored for 10mins at the beginning, then throughout the meal our waitress was unpleasant, she even seemed anoyed when were not ready to order the first time she came to check on us. To top it all off, after were done with our meal we asked for the bill, and it took her 15 mins (seriously! ) to bring it out. 
All in all, it was good food, but a little expensive for what you are getting, and the service really needs to be improved on. I will return, but I don't think I'm going to be making El Trompo my go to place when Im craving mexican."}
{"text":"Et bien on aime beaucoup. Dommage qu'ils aient autant d'ennuis avec les inspecteurs de la ville, car ici c'est authentique de chez authentique. Le personnel en cuisine comme en salle nous arrive du Mexique et tout est bien relevé et plein de saveurs. Allez, un petit effort et ce sera parfait les amis ! Ce serait dommage de voir ce petit restaurant fort sympathique tomber pour une histoire de manquements à la propreté."}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere. The decoration and inside the restaurant are very Mexican. I like their fran. Tacos are pretty good. Service is good, too. El Trompo is One of the best Mexican places."}
{"text":"It took a trip to El Trompo Taco Bar to remind me of a great community that I often forget.  Kensington Market is a vibrant, energetic and colorful neighborhood, a perfect place for a warm and homey restaurant like El Trompo!

The food was awesome.  I enjoyed the homemade bean soup with bacon and Mexican spices. Oh, so yummy!  The tacos were equally good.  My favorite was the Chorizo taco.  Loved the spiciness of the sausage.  The chuleta was quite tasty as well, a bit heavy on the salt, but a spoon full of house-made salsa made it taste heaps better.  The pork pieces were tender and moist.  

Adore the friendliness and prompt service!  I cannot wait to stop by for weekend brunch!"}
{"text":"I have to say I'm happy about this place. I agree that it has good, authentic Mexican food. The toppings part of any meal were noticeably prepared fresh. The nachos were yummy, and not greasy like the ones you can find at Moxies. I also had beef fajitas, which were made of delectable grilled vegetables, cheese and beef that you put onto your own tortilla. Although, I wasnt so thrilled about the chicken tacos I too ordered. It was simply just a taco that came with chicken and cilantro. The waitress suggested this option but next time I will get a taco that has more toppings. They are also reasonably priced and have friendly staff."}
{"text":"Cute little taco place close to bloor and Bathurst! Wasn't too busy when we got there at around 6pm. Fairly priced and good value. Guac and chips were good. Mexican corn was smothered in sauce and delicious for one cob divided into two portions. We tried one of each taco and it was delicious. The fish one was my favorite! Flavors great! Service mediocre but food was good. Overall I'd rate it as 3.5/5."}
{"text":"A little tiny place that's bursting with colour , music and customers , plus it has the best tacos ever - I would go back for sure!"}

Extra information:

*Patio during Summer
*Around 7 tables outside
*No air conditioning inside
*Small seating area

One of the cuisines I started to enjoy as I got older was Mexican. Growing up in Vancouver, we didn't really get much options for Mexican restaurants until recently. It was only when I moved to New York 4 years ago that I was introduced to real, authentic (somewhat) and delicious Mexican food. 

El Trompo Taco Bar is located in Kensington Market, a little far from public transit so you might have to walk a bit. When I went, the weather was still hot so we decided to sit out in the patio since there were no air conditioning inside.

When you sit down, they give you 2 hot sauce in plastic bowls. One of them are red hot sauce (spicy & salty) where as the other one is green hot sauce (refreshing & has that after kick). These come with 2 spoons and I realized they don't give you specific instructions as how to use them, are you suppose to use the spoons to scoop up some sauce for your plate? or do you use the spoon to put some on your chip? or do you dip your chip in the bowl? I was seeing people using it different ways and it made me wonder how sanitary it could be cause I doubt all this is just for one time use.

Ordered: GUACAMOLE 4/5

*$6.75 for a bowl
*This is premade in the morning so it will come the moment you order it
*Has lots of fresh tomato pieces
*Came with basket of crunchy nacho chip
*Nacho chips are corn based and lighty salted
*Bowl doesn't look very big but it's very deep so you do get your money's worth
*Had a bit of cilantro but would prefer more
*Mixed this with green hot sauce and it was really good

Ordered: TINGA - SPICY CHICKEN 4/5

*Shredded chicken tacos cooked in tomato/smoked chipotle pepper sauce, topped with onions & coriander
*5 pieces for $9.75
*Small size tacos (authentic kind, not your taco bell size)
*They use single layer of taco instead of double
*Lots of shredded chicken, onion and cilantro
*Overall has very good flavor but it wasn't spicy at all
*Added lots of green hot sauce
*Messy to eat cause the juice will drip

Ordered: JARRITO DE PINA 2/5

*Pineapple Mexican Soda for $1.99
*Most popular flavor is Tamarind but I've tried that before
*Nothing special, just your average pineapple soda

Summary: I love this little taco joint, maybe next time I visit I can ask them to make my order spicier cause I know I can handle the heat. Def going back for their fresh guacamole and I want to try beef alambre next time!"}
{"text":"I expected this place to be very good- it came recommended by a friend and I've walked by countless times wanting to try it \"some day\".  That day came Sunday evening- and unfortunately I wish it didn't.
I got the Tacos al Pastor, their house specialty- and I was disappointed.  $11 for 5 small corn tacos with pork, cilantro and onions.  Nothing really distinguished them to me.
Oh well, another one off the list:)"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos, traditional, and filling. 

Definitely priced right considering some of the newer places that serve the fusion-y tacos sell for about 4 bucks for a single taco.

Not  a lot of seating, but definitely worth the wait if it's busy."}
{"text":"My friend and I came across this place while strolling Kensington Market late this evening and it was a pleasant surprise. Given that we walked in pretty close to closing time, the staff were still very welcoming and warm. Some staff at other places may have been like Bon Qui Qui and would've called saccurity on you. The food also came rather quickly which may or may not have been a fluke. Regardless, the service was great. 5/5 just for the service. 

Guacamole - I'm picky with my guacamole and theirs was definitely one of the best I've had anywhere. I'm pretty sure the buttery avocados were hand-picked by God Himself, from His garden. It was delicious! Was great to have as an app as well as a topping for our tacos. 5/5.

Bistec Tacos - Had a hankering got tacos and theirs hit the spot. When I speak of God's garden and the avocados, I'm also quite sure that Cilantro was from Satan's garden. I hate that stuff, so I of course opted out of it. And yes, I know that cilantro is such a big part of Mexican dishes but yanno. With that said, my Bistec tacos (aka beef steak) looked rather boring with just the sautéed onions. However, with a few drops of fresh lime and hot sauce, plus God's guacamole, I was in heaven. The serving was also pretty generous and reasonable for its price of $9.75. My friend and I also liked how simple it was and how they didn't \"Americanize\" the tacos with sides like sour cream and/or cheese. Was just straight up, Mexican tacos. 4/5.

Grilled Chicken Tacos - Also a generous serving though I wish they had a little bit more flavour with the chicken. It actually came so fast that I had to double check it if was cooked. The chicken was nice and juicy (I think they used dark meat), but again, it lacked some flavour. 3.5/5"}
{"text":"Small place but amazing food. Tried a bunch of tacos, the chorizo quesadilla and their guac. The quesadilla and guacamole was AMAZING. Service is great and our meal (for two) came up to less than $30! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Really great tacos, not very expensive.  Can be a little difficult to get a table but it's worth it."}
{"text":"It's an inexpensive restaurant located right in Kensington Market. They do offer tasty plates!:) There's this chicken thing w/ cheese on the right bottom corner of the menu that tastes really good! Too bad i can't remember its name. Will indeed visit again to find out."}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere in the restaurant, and on the patio.  Friendly vibe, and animated crowd without it being overwhelming.  I tried the spicy chicken (tinga) tacos, and they were delicious.  It's a little bit on the expensive side for the portion sizes, but it was good enough that I'm excited about going back and trying more of their menu."}
{"text":"This is by far my favourite taco joints in the city. Almost authentic, very YUMMY and affordable. Their little patio outside is just amazing, the staff es muy fantastico, and they always seem to think I am Spanish when I go there because I can roll my R's and can pronounce the names of the food in a non-gringo way. I basically tried all the tacos in the menu, they are all yummy! I highly recommend, waiting for a seat in the patio can be a wait, but its well worth it."}
{"text":"Seriously good tacos! We had the chicken tinga and al pastor tacos. The chicken tinga was amazing and the al pastor was pretty good. The salsas are delicious as well. It's a really good deal--9.75 for 5 tacos! The tacos came out really quick too."}
{"text":"It wasn't bad. But it wasn't the best.

Had the fish taco, pull pork and beef with pineapple (I forgot the name for it but it was the signature Mexican taco) as well as the bean soup.

I didn't find the taco anything that spectacular although the tortilla was one of the better ones that I've had. The soup was a bit too salty for my liking.

But the staff was great. The waitress that served us was attentive and really friendly. She made sure the table was cleared of the plates to make room for the other food and also refilled water.c"}
{"text":"Tortillas here are nothing special and really small. Chicken tacos were tiny bits of chicken covered in onions. Husb had the pork fajitas and I tried one. It started out tasty and oddly smoky and then turned into fire in my mouth. I know a few people who would love this simply for the spice, but for me it wasn't enough, really. I like flavor, too. 

Lived near the Mexico border for too long to enjoy this as \"Mexican food.\" I have never seen tacos so small or so...boring. Even the chorizo was just so-so."}
{"text":"Holy sh**!!! They've got good food!!!

Also try their horchatas, as authentic as the one I had in Spain!"}
{"text":"This place is perfect for an inexpensive taco meal. 

But I would recommend only two varieties, the chicken tinga and the Mexican chorizo. Although the tinga was way better, the chorizo tasted much better once I added the green salsa provided at the table. The guacamole was pretty good but not the best that I've had.

I really liked the ambiance of the place, its not very large and the service is super fast! I will definitely be returning to have the tacos and maybe even try the fajitas next time.

PS: I'm not a big fan of pineapple and that turned out to be a bit of an issue since most specials have pineapple in them."}
{"text":"The food at El Trompo is great. It's authentic Mexican, which is very simple, few ingredients and very fresh.

When I go, I typically get the Tinga and the Al Pastor tacos. The flour tortillas are soft and fresh and the fillings are great and you can appreciate all of the ingredients. The decor is nothing to write home about, but it's Kensington so you would be foolish to factor that too heavily, and that's the only reason for the one star deduction. During the summer though, it's perfect as it has a nice outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Best tacos I've had in town! 

I'm not around this area often and a friend brought me here once before a show nearby. I have to say that it's 5 stars for taste and authenticity. It's always pretty packed here, and the tables are tiny.  A very lively place though the hours are weird (closes quite early).

Ate the first taco without any sauce to try it out, then started adding hot sauce and it was amazing!"}
{"text":"Been here 5 times now, and never leave disappointed! The tacos are delicious, I haven't tried them all but the orange marinated pulled pork tacos are great, and Tacos al Pastor are classic as well. Fish tacos here are also quite a treat. If you want a snack, their guacamole was quite fresh ( just a tad bit too salty, even though my girlfriend didn't think so). Overall, this place is a personal favorite in Kensington market."}
{"text":"I went for lunch the food was pretty good, but the servings are very small. You probably need 3 orders of tacos between 2 people."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars.

I'm not much of an expert on Mexican cuisine at all, but I don't like the way they decided to put their hot sauces on the table, uncovered. Other than that I enjoyed most of the food, especially the guacamole. Yes, it had been premade and refrigerated until I ordered but with so many customers, you can't blame them. Plus, it still tasted quite good! At least the tortilla chips were freshly fried. :)

The tacos my friend and I had were okay. I liked my chorizo tacos a little more and despite how little it looked like we had, it ended up being enough to fill the stomachs of two grown guys. It's a pretty cheap dinner too, even though my buddy and I both had a little trouble with our stomachs later, if y'all catch my drift. 

For a full review with more pictures, feel free to visit my blog, conveniently located in my profile. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Guacamole and fish tacos! I've been on a Mexican binge lately and enjoyed this place. We ordered guacamole, fish tacos, Al Pastor Alambres and a Quesongo. I really loved the guacamole (super fresh and generous with the portion and the tortilla chips were fresh and not too salty) and the fish taco (super flavourful, light and lots of fresh ingredients!). I didn't enjoy the Al Pastor Alambres so much because it wasn't very flavourful and pork tends to cook a little on the dry side. The Quesong was a little weird but interesting (grilled fresh mushroom with melted cheese in a flour corn tortilla) - I've never had anything like it. It was good but different.. I would definitely return for the guac and fish taco"}
{"text":"I said, \"I don't love the taco's there.\" In advance of waiting in front ot the Taco Bar to get a seat on the coveted terrace.  But, it had been years since I tried the authentic Mexican tacos at El Trompo, and it was so hot I couldn't stand to eat indoors. However, after 20 minutes of waiting the waitress let us know the patron had just ordered another beer and we might as well sit inside. We did and promptly after ordering lime margaritas (blended) we were able to sit outside anyway! Service A+!
However as I reviewed the menu, I recalled why I don't hate the tacos, but I do feel like I'm in 1995 when Vegetarians are just an afterthought. There are almost no options here. I ended up ordering the $7 Huitlacoche - a mexican corn fungus- quesadilla. 
Food arrives and it is a single 8 inch corn tortilla stuffed with black beans and this fungal delicacy folded in half. I'm going to need more food than that! I ended up ordering a likely non-vegetarian side of frijoles refritos to finish off our basket of chips. 
Recommend this place for the margartas on the patio (Though the non-blended version Burger Bar serves up is far superior) or beers with chips and guac. Otherwise, I still don't love this place."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times now and this is one of those consistent \"good-for-the-price\" kind of spots.  

For me, I've had a lot of taco eating experience in the US so I didn't find these tacos particularly amazing in comparison but still good.  In a place like NYC or Cali, this place would struggle to be average, this is why I have a hard time giving 4 stars.  

But I still think this place is worth checking out if you are looking for quick, cheap Mexican food.  They seem to have all the basics you would expect in a taco joint in a fun, casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"LOVE.  

Never heard of it prior.  Glad I had a friend that suggested it as we walked by it, showing around some 'out of town' friends what Kensington Market is made of...

I think four tables outside?  If you aren't familiar with Kensington, it is rustic/casual to put it mildly.  Either you love it, or you hate it.  I would've hated it when I was growing up/refused to try it.  But LOVE as an adult.  It reeks of authenticity.

YUM guac & chips!  This was technically our breakfast appetizer, even though it must've been after 2pm.  Have tried a lot of Mexican in the city, but dying to get back to this place asap just for a snack even (ie the guac).

Delicious molten cheese with mushroom.  Never heard of anything like this before.  Very rich and filling, so if you order this as an appetizer, you probably won't be finishing your entree.  But guess that's what doggie bags were invented for.

Great huevoes a la mexicana breakfast:  scrambled eggs with tomato, garlic, onion, chilli.  Served with refried beans, pico de galla & coffee.  I don't like regular coffee so they gave that to my friend, who had asked for seconds.  The first one is free, but you pay for re-fills I think?

Very happy that they have Jarritos (delicious Mexican bottled pop in various flavors).  I would expect nothing less, but many Mex restaurants in Toronto don't carry them.

Good prices!

Bathrooms in the basement, per usual in Toronto.  Newspaper and free junk lined up on the stairs made me think I wouldn't want to be here if I was drinking at night.... yes, I'd \"die\" over the food, but then probably actually die falling down the stairs if I had to go use the bathroom.  LOL

Can't wait to go back with different people, and/or for a different time of day."}
{"text":"Authentic tacos that bring me back to some of my time spent in San Francisco's \"The Mission\". Reasonable prices. Great service. Clean. I'll keep coming back again and again. 

The only thing I would change (and perhaps it's just personal preference) is having the tacos made with 2 soft tortillas layered on top of each other rather than just 1."}
{"text":"My friend and I nabbed a spot on the patio this afternoon for a drink and maybe some dinner. We got our very sugary margs and guacamole incredibly quickly. 

I expect that the guac comes so quickly because it's made quite a bit in advance, which is totally reasonable. Sadly however the guacamole tasted quite strongly of mayo (a trick to stretch it out). Yuck. Crummy store bought chips along side did not do it any favours. 

Bummer."}

Guacamole was really very good, but $7 for a tinyy bowl does not sit so well with me. The corn truffle quesadilla was interesting, but flavour wise it did not blow any minds. Veggie fajitas were pretty standard grilled veg, and bistec tacos were OK. 
They did have a nice verde sauce though. 
Food versus price: 3/5

It's cute, if a little chaotic and loud inside. Bright yellow and painted walls with hanging art give the place the vibrance of a movie-mexican-restaurant scene. Servers were not memorable in a particularly good or bad way. Paying is done at the front.
Service/ambiance: 4/5

I'm not sure I'll be rushing back, especially with all the other options around the area. But who knows, maybe one day."}
{"text":"Went here with a small group of friends and shared some dishes together.  For apps, we had both the guacamole and the pico de gallo.  The guacamole was excellent although the pico de gallo was disappointing as I couldn't taste any of the onions, chili peppers or cilantro (it just tasted like a bowl of chopped tomatoes - although to their credit the tomatoes were extremely fresh).  I then tried a couple of different tacos (the bistec and the spicy tinga chicken).  The grilled beef tacos tasted a little strange.  For whatever reason, the flavour reminded me of coca cola (I found it baffling).  However, the spicy tinga chicken tacos were a hit.  They weren't all that hot or spicy but they had a lot of flavour with some nice smokiness to it that I found kind of addicting.  I found the prices a little high for what's supposed to be Mexican street food but it wasn't anything overly outrageous.  Service was extremely friendly (and fast) which is always a plus in spite of how insanely busy they were.  I'll probably visit again."}
{"text":"Just went here for lunch.  A nice little place, and absolutely delicious tacos!  After a few years in California, I've really gotten a taste for Mexican food and of all of the Mexican places I've tried in Toronto, this has got to be my favorite!"}
{"text":"Agree that this is the most authentic tacos we've had in Toronto - had visited Yelapa, a small fishing village outside of Puerta Vallarta where we were had our first experience with true Mexican tacos. Our faves at El Trompo are the chorizo and al pastor tacos as well as the molten cheese. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"service was super fast, and food was absolutely delicious! we got the guacamole with chips, el pastor tacos, and a fish taco. my favourite was definitely the al pastor.. who would have thought pulled pork and pineapple would work so well together? i added some of the guac into the taco as well, and it was really good!"}
{"text":"Five tacos for less than $10 is a pretty good deal and it's nice to sit outside and just people-watch. 
The beef tacos with cheese were solid :)"}
{"text":"We had the tacos al pastor. It was OK but a bit on the oilier side. The value was decent."}
{"text":"Service is super-friendly. Fish Tacos are my favourite! We try to go every weekend. Now that it's patio season it's a lot of fun to sit out on Augusta and enjoy the sights and sounds of Kensington Market while sipping on Modelos and eating fresh guacamole."}
{"text":"Just. No. 0/5

Nestled within the vibrant Kensington Market, after reading some of the mixed reviews on yelp, I decided to give this place a chance. Never again; it completely soured my date night.

Pros:
- None.
Kensington market is a lovely little pocket within the city. HOWEVER, there are  dozens of better restaurants in the area 

Cons:
- Waitress plunked down a bowl of guacamole on to our table when we clearly had not ordered any food yet (we didn't even have our water). After about 5 minutes we  finally flagged her down and said we had not touched the guacamole and did not want it. She said we had, and was very irritated as she hastily whisked the bowl away.
- I tried the Al Pastor Tacos, and my bf had the Spicy Chicken. We were both disappointed at: 
(1) How small the portions were, and how there is only a meagre sprinkling of some pulled pork or chicken on very dry tortilla wrappers. Wasn't filling at all. 
(2) It was tasteless and I ended up drenching it in the various sauces that were parked on the table. There is no cheese, no vegetables, no nothing else in those tacos. Just these tiny dry tortilla wrappers topped with dry meat and a sprinkling of diced onions
(3) Overpriced!! Overall I felt really terrible afterward and this experience definitely ruined the entire date. 

Was not impressed at all. Infinitely better Mexican food can be found along Yonge Street, near Yonge and Wellesley."}
{"text":"What a treasure. This small, unassuming taco restaurant has some of the best pork tacos I have ever eaten.  Excellent blend of savory, sweet, and tangy. This is a great lunch spot."}
{"text":"Soooooooooooo good! I'm from California and these are the closest to real LA/San Diego tacos I've had! 

If you're in the area and want an authentic taco spot (with many more options) come here! 5 carne asada tacos (decent sized) for only $8-10, customer service was great (I think I asked for limes like 5x), and the chips with guacamole was SO good!

Do some shopping in Kensington market once you're all stuffed :)"}
{"text":"Was craving mexican and we had 7 lives the week before so we decided to come to El Trompo Taco bar.  They had a lovely outdoor seating area. Had the Tacos al pastor and Spicy Tinga Chicken.  4 tacos per order.  Only downside was staff was slow and pretty unfriendly as we tried to ask them questions about the menu.  They didn't come take our order after 5 mins of waiting until we had to flag down the same girl twice.  Overall, good food, service was a let down."}
{"text":"Tried a fish taco. The taco was too small and the taste was so-so."}
{"text":"- frakkin awesome
- if you can help it, sit on the tiny patio they have, as it gets extremely hot inside the restaurant. perhaps, they are trying to make it feel like mexico in there... i dunno.
- and get the guacamole. you will be sorry if you dont.
- the tacos el asador were magical. pork. onion. cilantro. pineapple. mmmm....
- handmade tortillias, and mexican streetfood.... how can it get any better? (maybe if they open one closer to where i live)"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food was amazing.

We ordered guac and chips as well as pico de gallo as appetizers. For mains, we ordered tacos al pastor, tinga tacos and cochinita pibil. Everything was really tasty and affordable. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I have a soft spot for Taco Hell but if I'm smart and don't want to punish my bowels, I'll let this place satiate my craving for Mexican food. This is the real deal!
I sat out on the very small patio (probably seats around 10-12 people). Service was very quick though the girl serving us didn't seem too friendly. My friend tried to order in spanish but she wasn't impressed. I ordered the crispy cheese appetizer and the mushroom quesadillas. The crispy cheese come in a box-like shape. It's like eating the cheese you scrape off the baking sheet when you make homemade nachos in the oven. There's two little dishes of green (mild) and red (hot!hot!hot!) sauce that went well with the cheese. The mushroom quesadilla though small in quantity, was very filling although if I were a dude, you might still feel a bit hungry. The corn tortilla was a little bit thicker than I'm used to but was pretty spongey and tasty! 
I think I'll try the mini tacos next time around. They looked pretty good and there's enough vegetarian options to keep me satisfied. 
oh and it doesn't make you run for the bathroom like Taco Hell!"}
{"text":"Thought food was nothing special ... Breakfast items are disappointing and the tacos are somewhat above average (but not very amazing by any means).  Staff was friendly and service was prompt."}
{"text":"Living in Kensington Market, I am ashamed to admit this is my first time venturing to this joint. This place is the Lupper of champions. The guacomole and the Salsa are incredibly fresh and the tacos are unique. I split the beef tacos and the pulled pork ones with my BFF. The Pulled pork ones have pineapple in them and it was a very satisfying food experience!

The prices are right and the staff are brilliant. 

I recommend sticking it out and trying to get a spot on their small patio. It's worth it to watch the world that is Kensington Market go by. 

Although I opted for a beer, the Margaritas looked pretty quenching.

Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"I had the taco el pastor and it was cold and dry. The hot sauce was not hot at all. Ten bucks for 5 tacos is a pretty good deal though.

The servers were nice."}
{"text":"There are days that I have considered driving 4 hours just for tacos al pastor.  Okay, there is an actual day where I did drive the 4 hours.  Sometimes you just get the craving.  They have fantastic guacamole and salsas as well.  Give it a try, and thank me later :)"}
{"text":"We love this place!
It's always been my favorite- but after reading some of the recent reviews I was a little worried that the quality had gone down... I'm happy to say I didn't find the  speed of service or the quality of our meal was any different than before. 
They are on the ball. 1:00pm and the place has a line up and a steady flow of food coming out and people happy and full. It's cozy- family style seating through the center of the room, and some tables for two along the sides. 
We ordered the el pastor, chorizo, and spicy chicken tacos, as well as the guac and chips. Within moments of ordering the guac had chips arrived. Within ten-15 minutes the rest of our food. Amazingly delicious. Hot and fresh- yum yum! Sooo filling! We're stuffed.
Can't wait to come again."}
{"text":"This is currently my favourite restaurant and everytime I have the tacos al pastor. My boyfriend complains that he still feels hungry after eating here, so I can see how it may disappoint big eaters. I'm totally satisfied with it though! The tacos are delicious, addicting and memorable! Some find it expensive but when you think about it as being $2 per taco, it's actually not bad. Plus it's about flavourrrrr, which this place has a lot of in my opinion. I love that they have horchata and tecate which they can make into micheladas for you. If you're craving tacos al pastor, I highly recommend this delicious place! I heard the other food is good too but I'm too addicted to the tacos to try anything else :)"}
{"text":"We've never had food this authentic and good outside of Mexico before...

There's no better way to describe the experience than that.  We started with the guacamole, which was fresh and tasty.  It's so good you don't want to stop eating it.  Save some for the tacos - for which we had both the tacos al pastor and chorizo.  Both tacos had great flavor and everything was fresh.  We had nearly an identical meal in a local restaurant in Baja California, and it doesn't get much better for mexican.

If you're like us, smaller servings are better.  We could have shared one order of 5 tacos, but since we were from out of town we had to try both."}
{"text":"Always tasty and real! True Mexican and quality food!
I like to stop by at least a couple of times a month and enjoy the friendly staff and some REAL Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Tasty, simple tacos. Good price. Got the chorizo tacos and they did not disappoint. Would be nice if you could just order one taco instead of five of one kind. But it's understandable."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal and the owners is super friendly.  I ordered the quesadilla stuffed with chorizo. Hot dammn! Amazing. Also had a few fish tacos. Thoroughly delicious and seasoned as well. The prices are very reasonable given the quality of the food.  When I went here it seemed like there were alot of spanish-speaking people sitting around chewing on stuff when I went in there, and that tells me that this would be an authentic experience for my tastebuds.  My hunch was right.  The Mexican football game was playing on the TV screens throughout dinner and a few times I heard \"GOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!!!!!!!!\" which was pretty cool.  Overall, you'll get a hugely Mexican vibe being in here, amazing taste and flavours (could not find a single negative, not one), and very chill and accommodating service.  Will be back to try every single thing on that menu."}
{"text":"I've recently been spoiled by Mexican in the US and while El Trompo is good, its not my favorite Mexican in the whole world. I had the El Pasto Tacos last time I was here. They were pretty good and very flavorful. This restaurant has a bit more ambiance (and nicer seating) than neighboring hole in the wall \"Emporium Latino\", but I find the prices here a bit more expensive and the food not quite as tasty. Perfectly fine if you want a sit down meal though."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly and awesome, fast service. I love the gringo quesadilla, simple but priced accordingly. Margaritas are super sweet and yum! Always great for a quick bite."}
{"text":"The spicy chicken was really good with the green salsa. Outdoor searing was good as well. Need to try more things to give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"Not bad - the food here was good, prices were very reasonable. I even tried one of the more interesting things on the menu - the cheese cracker thing, which was tasty (but expensive - $4!). I also got some Tacos, but what I didn't like is that they were not willing to \"customize\" my taco at all - and by that I mean I didn't want them to put onions on it, and they said no. Not the best customer service. The Tacos were also \"meh\" - for the price you can't complain, but they were not taste in my opinion - there's a couple better ones I've tried downtown that offer tastier tacos (but they do cost a bit more - but I'm willing to pay a premium for it)."}
{"text":"The food here is good. Tacos Al Pastor are really delicious and I know that many Mexican people eat here. I just don't love the atmosphere. It's super expensive for what you get. Three little tacos each and a really small side of guac, for 2 ppl ran up almost $45. Have a margarita and you're looking at more. I don't like many sit down Mexican places because my best friend's husband is Mexican and he makes us some tasty authentic treats at home. I also make a pretty mean guacamole, myself. Very cramped and there's not much  vibe on the patio as it's the more concrete upper area of Augusta. I feel like this place can't decide whether they are a taco stand or a restaurant. I'd suggest getting tacos to go and then heading to the park. Skip the sip and the tip."}
{"text":"Love this place. I only ever come here for the patio. Its a small little joint so it gets busy in the summer when everyone wants the patio but I often find myself waiting.

The food is good, not the best tacos (I'd give that to Seven Lives down the street) but I enjoy the atmosphere the seating is better than Seven Lives. The guacamole and the normal salsa dips for the chips are great appetizers and everyone gets them so don't skip that. Other than that, the foods all decent and just comes down to preference. Order your chips and choice of dip, food and a nice Mexican beer and just chill in the sun."}
{"text":"This place was ok. I had a fish taco and al pastor tocos. They were a bit dry but I could taste the flavors. it was in a tiny place but was cute. The margaritas and sorrel had me craving more! 3.5/5"}
{"text":"I love El Trompo.  I find that I'm coming here pretty much at least once everytime I make my way back to Toronto.  Even when it's cold and I don't get to enjoy the little patio.

I usually go with a mixed plate of tacos.  Most recently that was 2 al pastor, 2 chorizo, and 1 pollo tinga.  I'm really a fan of the al pastor, but I just can't get myself to not eat some of the other types of tacos at the same time :).  The al pastor has pineapple chunks in it, and while that may sound non-traditional or odd it's really subtle and quite nice.

The red salsa is spicier than the green, though really not that spicy.  Also, the red sauce definitely has smoked chilis in it... I find that combo a bit unfortunate because I really like my spice, but I'm not a huge fan of the taste of smoked chilis.  I usually end up throwing both red and green on my tacos and wash it down with a negra modelo.  mmm good!"}
{"text":"I was expecting a little better tasting tacos. The fish taco was better than the chicken for sure. The server was probably new and was often making mistakes. Good thing we got a space on the patio 'cause it smelled strongly of spices inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"For Canada, this place is good. They serve nice meals at a fair price. I ordered a few tacos and the place was crowded, even despite the freezing rain. This place is in the Kensington Market off the Spadina Subway Line near Dundas. The owners seem to be Mexican expatriates. Better than some of the burrito-type joints in the downtown area."}
{"text":"Great place, great vibe. Tiny but serves delicious food. Service was great! loved everything i ate!"}
{"text":"Maybe I'm just a dirtbag and like tex mex style tacos better, but I wasn't impressed by the tacos here at all.  I had the chorizo ones, as well as the al pastor and was seriously disappointed especially after hearing everyone rave about this place.  The seasoning was not to my liking at all.  I wonder if everyone loves this place because its \"authentic\" or because they actually really like the food, I think its the former.  Also portion size is pathetic, I don't need a buffet plate but the three tacos they serve is kids size and for that price? No.  The only thing saving this from a 1 star is their guac.  Give me a chimichanga from Mexico Lindo any day over this."}
{"text":"Great spot! A must when in the area. Small, quaint and great service. The fish tacos are simple and tasty. Already planning my next visit to try the guacamole, tacos and soup. The tortillas are super fresh. Though hard not to have the fish taco again..."}
{"text":"Best tacos...pretty good margaritas too...loved the pico de gallo and guacamole...wait staff pleasant...didn't have to wait long for the delicious food...definitely going back again"}
{"text":"El Trompo sheltered me from a brewing storm outside. They don't get a star for that but I was grateful for being saved from a third soaking in 2 weeks (and everyone told me it doesn't rain much in Toronto?)

I went for the combo of soup and tacos for $12. The soup was good. Bacon and beans being the most prevalent flavours. 
For the tacos I opted for the vegetarian which contained mushrooms, cheese and a few other bits and pieces. The flavour combos were great and went very well with the green hot sauce on the table.

The ladies working there are lovely. 

I wasn't 'wowed' but I left having enjoyed it and will go back again in the hope of a 'wow'."}
{"text":"I'd been waiting to get my taco-on here for a while.  I finally went with my friend for brunch.  We arrived at 11am and got a nifty patio seat.  I found the patio a little squishy.

I think I over-hyped it.  Or maybe I'm just confusing tex-mex with traditional Mexican but I found the food pretty bland and overpriced.  My friend had the pork and pineapple and I had the grilled chicken.  I found both to be pretty dry, even after drenching them in lime and throwing some guac on top.

Overall, I've had better Mexican.  I need some flavour.  I need some spice!  And most importantly, meat that's a bit more hydrated."}
{"text":"...mexico lindo and playa cabana kills this place hands down. i have heard so many good things about this place and to have trekked through the god awful nuit blanche traffic to try it out was soo not worth it. 

we ordered:
guacamole with chips, not good, portion too small and was quite bland. 
taco al pastor, good. 
hawaiian quesadilla, average. 
horchata, average, too much cinnamon. 

all the portions were like snack-sized for main entree prices. if it weren't for the awesome churro bakery down the street i found it would have been a disappointing trip to kensington market."}
{"text":"Great tastes overall, a little pricey.

We ordered a Corona and a lime margherita, 2 platter of tinga (spicy) chicken tacos, fajitas and a nacho platter. For 2 it came out at $60. And by pricey, I am really reminiscing about the deals we had with foods we had in Cancun.

Great date idea or just for a stroll and drop-in (expect a line though)."}
{"text":"Please please save your money and go somewhere else, it hurts me to see people pay for the food here!, portions are tiny as in Mexico except here they charge you 4 times what you'd pay there, last time I was there, the meat didn't even come from the spit, in fact there wasn't even one! I thought they were famous because of that?  So many other decent places in the city"}
{"text":"Probably the only place in Toronto that know how to make Mexico City style tacos. The owner is a very nice woman always happy and smiling. 
I recommend the Fajitas and above all, make sure to have the Mexican Ice Tea. 
The atmosphere of the restaurant is very Mexican too ;)"}
{"text":"Super basic. House special tacos comes to $12 and you get 5 tiny tacos with a tea spoon of pork each and a small sprinkle of cilantro.  Crappy Molson Canadian only in bottles for $6 and a couple other similar tasting Mexican beers. Too divey and basic for the price. It's really just a fast food spot."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem of Toronto. I remember eating tacos in Mexico...cheap...simple...but delicious. I discovered this place upon accident when I was trying to locate another taco place in Kensington Market, but boy oh boy, am I glad to have made that mistake! 

When I took a bite of their al pastor taco, I was instantly brought back to Puerto Vallerta, where I had the most delicious tacos made by the locals. All the other Torontonian taco places make their tacos fancy and novel by adding their twist, but this place keeps true to their taco making. I've tried all their tacos now, but my favourite will always be their Al Pastor. The little slices of pineapple that come with the pork are absolutely divine.

And plus they have apple Jumex, my absolute favourite (and must have when tacos are eaten)! Do go here, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best damn tacos! Nice little place with good seating, feels authentic perfect for lunch ... Wish it was a few bucks less but worth it ..I'll come back, recommended!"}
{"text":"Last night I went to El Trompo for a friend's birthday dinner prior to hitting Nuit Blanche with him and his other friends. I almost always research a restaurant's menu prior to the date of the event, because being vegan isn't always easy and I don't like unpleasant surprises. Needless to say, since having done my research ahead of time, I'd narrowed down my dinner choices to 3 items: the nachos (sans fromage), the mushroom tacos, or the vegetarian fajitas (sans fromage). The nachos are appetizers and the latter 2 are entrees. Prior to attending my friend's dinner party, I was at another party where I had snacks and wine, and  since I wasn't too hungry, I ended up ordering the nachos (sans fromage).  

I was really happy with my dinner when it arrived, it was delicious, not too heavy, and fresh: corn chips smothered evenly with refried beans and tomato salsa. It was the perfect comfort food: warm and crunchy, healthy (sans fromage = sans gras), and full of flavor. The nachos also came in a good size, bigger than I'd expected for $3.99 before taxes. My inexpensive dinner allowed me to buy the birthday boy a shot of tequila (~$5 a shot) and take one with him; I found it amusing that I'd spent more on alcohol than on my actual meal. 

One disappointing aspect of my dining experience at El Trompo was the interior design of the restaurant: it was not aesthetically appealing -it was like a shack, and the dining area was too cramp -I do not like being in close proximity with other patrons who are not a part of my party. The appearance of the restaurant plays a great role in my overall dinning experience: I have to be happy and comfortable sitting in the establishment in order to enjoy the food, and for most cases, the place must be visually stunning and lovely for me to enjoy myself. However, regardless of this slight setback, I had a great time at dinner with my friend and his friends last night."}
{"text":"I went to Kensington Market last Saturday with a friend in search of Mexican food and a quick bite to catch up. We passed by a few taco places and decided to go with El Trompo because it looked busy (busy means it's popular/well-liked, right?) yet spacious. We were seated right away after being greeted by a friendly server. My friend and I shared one of the main taco dishes with two iced drinks. The orders came quickly and everything was delicious. I'll be frank when I say I didn't expect much but it exceeded my expectations - the interior of the place looked a bit old and run down (a bit rustic, if you may), but the service and the food is incredible. The fish and chicken tacos are great! Definitely recommend :) 

* Good for SMALL groups (like groups of 3-4)."}
{"text":"If you are in the area on the weekend, please please stop by and get the pozole. First of all, it is only $5!!!!!!!!!!! And it is so so so so so good.

However... tacos al pastor is on their sign outside and it got me excited. So I also tried the taco al pastor, which is supposed to be marinated pork, and it was just okay. My boyfriend had the pastor torta which is also a weekend special - for $9 it was kind of disappointing, it was okay once again. Tortas traditionally have lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, sour cream, avocado, but this torta had none of that, only the meat.

We also asked for nachos as an appetizer, and they never made it onto the table. We had to remind our server about them, so they put them on a container to go. It was basically just chips with picó (not fresh), and cheese. Not even melted cheese.

I would go back, but just for the pozole."}
{"text":"Good authentic Mexican food, the decor is very nice. As a Mexican I'm very picky with Mexican food but this place makes me feel almost in Mexico."}
{"text":"The taco Al Pastor was highlighted as the star item on the menu and so we gave it a go. It is pork taco sauteed with pineapple. for almost $10 it came with 5 miniature tacos with a slice of lime. The taste, however was very familiar to me as it taste like bland Asian home cooking. 

We also ordered the spicy chicken tinga taco were slightly better as the meat was tender and seasoned well. with tips and tax we put down $26 and walked away still very hungry. 

Question: does good Mexican food exists in Toronto?"}
{"text":"Yum!! One of my favorite patios in the summer. The family run business is authentic and friendly. They food is fast and delicious. I recommend the Molten Cheese with Mushrooms. It's Mexican!"}
{"text":"Helen and I ordered two tacos to share: pork and chicken with the cilantro requested on the side.  I really liked the chicken taco that Helen chose.  It was a bit saucy and less dry than the pork tacos.  There were five on each plate.

We also ordered an appetizer, fried cheese.  It had a 'warning' on the menu that this wasn't fried cheese sandwich which made it even more appealing to order and try.  It arrived 'standing up' on the plate and was indeed a flat piece of cheese that was fried.  How interesting!  We ate it piece by piece with our hands.  It was only a little greasy and very chewy and cheesy.  It was definitely something more interesting than just guacamole."}
{"text":"Mexican food in Toronto disappoints to now avail. A city as cosmos as hog town should really be able to serve up a more authentic array of the Mexican staples but alas... Enter this little Kensington joint... Been back here a few times for a quick taco fix and have yet to be disappointed. Staples like the mushroom (hongo) and fish are simple tasty tacos served on fluffy corn tortillas. Give this one a whirl..."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food. I love tacos and burritos. I love Mexican rice most of all. Although El Trompo doesn't serve rice, I still like it.

It's simple food done in a authentic way, at least it makes me believe so. It's not a cheap meal, it's pricey for the portions and they aren't too filling.
I've had the guac with chips, chorizo, al-pastor, and black corn fungus tacos. Dishes come in 3 or 4 small and portable tacos. 

Tacos are really tasty, I always want more. Chorizo is spiced well and al-pastor is tender. The corn fungus is certainly unique and palatable I would rather have the other two. The guac is alright, but I've had better and have made better too. 

The Horchata is my favorite drink there. It's like a rice milk that's spiced with flavor. It's good, just try it. 

Overall, the food is good but the portions are not filling. I could eat two plates easily and that would make my bill 20 bucks alone. For that price I would expect more anyways. 

It's great to have once in a while."}
{"text":"Can't wait for our orders of Al Pastor and cochinita pibil, always awesome flavours. It's like heaven in here, you should visit if you haven't yet.. All dishes amazing and we keep coming at least once a month. It's the gem in town."}
{"text":"Came here only because Seven Lives was closed for renovations and we were craving Mexican. 

I wouldn't say it's anything special here - typical and authentic, but nothing unique really to entice me for another visit. 

We got their special taco , something they were considering adding to the menu, but it wasn't as flavourful as the chicken tinga. 

There's lots of the menu, but I didn't find it anything special that blew me away."}
{"text":"I couldn't imagine eating in The market!  is it sanitized??? not me. anyhow.. if you being a tourist you wouldn't know better, stick to fine eateries."}
{"text":"Hubby and I are native Californians and love Mexican food! We sought out El Trompo and Seven Lives in the same day! Here is your comparison: 1) El Trompo serves margarita; great ones! We had lime, guava, and strawberry....tasty, especially on a nice day sitting outside on the small patio 2) tacos are on the smaller side, one order has 5 tacos. We had chorizo and el pastor, both we tasty! 3) Most people commented on the guacamole, this we were moderately impressed with. It's an avocado paste with diced tomatoes and onions. I am sure this is more cost effective, but in terms of authenticity, it's mediocre at best. If you're making a choice between here and Seven Lives, it really just depends on if you want to sit and people watch and if you want a drink."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch today, was pleasantly very satisfied! Had fish tacos which each came with 2 tortillas so I could even split them into 2 more each. Ingredients were fresh and tasty, and portion size for the $5 taco made it well worth it. Environment is very casual but service is good - I'd definitely come back here."}
{"text":"This is the best and most authentic Mexican restaurant in Toronto.  The food is delicious, the servers are super friendly and nice, the service is fast.  Fully bilingual restaurant (Spanish + English). But what I like the most is that it feels like truly home-made Mexican meals. I will keep coming back here."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food, sometimes a lineup but the authentic food is awesome. The staff is amazing, they are all so nice and attentive, it's like you took 2 steps into a real restaurant in a small Mexican town. Prices are okay, you do get full. They make Churros and the sell those soft authentic tacos if you want to purchase them."}
{"text":"On a recommendation we headed to El Trompo last Friday. 

I love the vibe in Kensington Market, especially at the end of a work week and especially in the summer. 

I love it even more because I can walk through the streets freely with my kid and not feel like people are looking like I have three eyes for bringing him out with me (ahem, Yorkville...ahem). 

El Trompo is a tiny, hole-in-the-wall authentic Mexican restaurant, the best way to be when you're a Mexican restaurant, in my opinion. 

The guacamole and chips is great. We shared an order of fajitas which are served differently than I am used to- with melted cheese directly on top of the meat/vegetables instead of with all of the fixings on the side. Everything was so great, we'll definitely be back. 

Beware the lineups in the summer though, and El Trompo's apparent popularity- there are like 6 other Mexican restaurants within a few blocks of one another and none are as busy as this one."}
{"text":"This is a great little gem in Kensington market that serves authentic Mexican food at reasonable prices.

Whenever I go (I go quite often in the summertime), I normally start off with the guacamole with corn chips ($6.75) which is fantastic, you can tell it's freshly made and they are pretty generous with the guacamole.

I then order the Al Pastor tacos ($9.75 for five tacos) which is their specialty, consists of marinated pork and bits of pineapple and onions. Even though they are five small tacos they are delicious, nicely marinated pork and perfectly made corn tortilla which I then add some hot sauce to make the perfect light meal.

I have been to Mexico a few times and tried tacos at restaurants and from local street vendors and the tacos at El Trompo are almost as good as the ones served in Mexico but better than any other place in Toronto. 

I asked some friends from Mexico what they thought of the place and they said it was really authentic.

It's a family run business with really friendly service.

They have a very small patio that is great for people watching in the summertime or just to sit back and enjoy a corona or two."}
{"text":"Really yummy and authentic. My family used to go to Mexico every year for my grandfathers birthday. Ever since I was little my favourite thing for breakfast was huitlacoche tortillas. I have never really found a replacement for them in the city until el trompo! It tasted like we right back in Mexico and honestly it felt like it too it must have been at least 30 degrees in there and just as noisy. The chicken tinga tacos were also delicious and the guacamole is some of the best in the city. The only thing I was really not a fan of was the we ordered the vegetable alambres and the pineapple tasted canned and so overly sweet I didn't want to eat it at all. Otherwise is a solid cheap fun eat."}
{"text":"Quality Mexican food at an inexpensive price. Everything was very fresh and had a lot of flavour."}
{"text":"Ate here for dinner after eating at seven lives last night. We ordered the nachos and fajitas to share. The portion was large enough of us both! Also, we enjoyed the flavors and taste of the food and the green salsa. Everything was freshly prepared and we enjoyed ourselves. The only thing that I was expecting was chips and salsa to just come out-- that's what I'm used to back in the states. Other than that this place hit the spot. Different taste than seven lives, but definitely tasty!"}
{"text":"Been there many times.  Food was delicious and the prices were reasonable!  Downfall: small space, crammed and food comes super slow and there's never any more than two waitresses for the whole restaurant even though there are six or seven staff behind the counter (cooks perhaps?)"}
{"text":"Unpretentious, delicious, pretty darn authentic Mexican food. 

Their margaritas are second to none; best I've had this far north of the border. Love that they serve horchata too!

The tacos are stellar, specifically the al pastor and chicken tinga. Seven bucks for guac is a little steep but it's really good stuff, so I'd say it's worth it. 

Definitely one of my favourite Kensington gems!"}
{"text":"Small space, but very nice place to relax.
Ordered the pico de gallo, Guac and nachos.
Spicy chicken tacos.

Very delicious food and will definitely return!
We wanted to order more food however the kitchen had already closed. =(

Would be nice if there was a variety of nachos (black chips/red chips variety)
as well as spoons instead of forks for the chip dips. Also, more than one lime would also be appreciated."}
{"text":"Not great. Fillings are pretty bland and is not cheap. Good atmosphere though, nice patio but maybe stick to the cervecas."}
{"text":"We went last week and ordered fish, grilled chicken and chorizo tacos. Very tasty. We also ordered guacamole and chips. Tasted fresh."}
{"text":"I was raised in Southern California and have been to Mexico (both Baja and the mainland) many a time. Ever since I moved to Canada, I have been missing authentic Mexican food, and my meal at El Trompo is the first one that even comes close to the delicious little street meat tacos I remember. 

However, if we were comparing these tacos to real Mexican tacos, I'd say it's a solid three stars. On the other hand, we'd have to compare El Trompo to the lack of good, authentic Mexican food in Toronto, then it's definitely 5 stars. I had the combination with bean soup (which was absolutely yum, and perfect for the chilly day) and 5 Al Pastor tacos. The meat was tender, and I love the sweetness of the pineapple with the pork. I also ordered the churros (fried dough rolled in cinnamon and sugar), which were okay but served cold -- they should have been served warm. 

I'd definitely come here again when I'm feeling a little homesick."}
{"text":"Chorizo taco. Get it. Authentic. Corn tortillas. Mexican family. Busy. Outdoor patio. Kensington Market. Regulars in-the-know. We were brought there by a local. We drank our weight in margaritas and stuffed our faces with salty crispy tortilla chips and creamy guacamole. I'm not really sure what else to say except it's the Real Deal. Ambiance is cafeteria-like. Fun factor is high."}
{"text":"This review is dedicated to the new CM Vivek!

O..M..G!! I don't have a wide range of different Mexican cuisines but I decided to try this place one day and I will never again say \"no\" to Mexican food. I have never been a big fan of burritos and what not but I think that is due to the fact that my exposure to it consists of Taco Bell and Old El Paso commercials. 

To start, I had to have the guacamole, once that touched my lips, I was hooked. I'm already a guac lover regardless of the taste but this was by far the best guacamole I've ever had. I can seriously go on and on about this guac, but I'll spare you. But I had the quesadillas, I was extremely skeptical to order this as I have had the \"white washed\" versions from Kelseys, Jack Astor's etc. But I was pleasantly surprised when savouring this tasty creation. The tortillas were soft and fresh and the chicken wasn't dry, although the cheese could have offset that. 

I was a little disheartened when the plates came and the portions were quite small, I guess I'm just used to the gargantuan size of the burritos a la Burrito Boyz or Chipotle. These little servings were actually a perfect size for my stomach, although I know that average sized humans would probably want a little more, which is why the guac is a definite MUST ORDER!

The atmosphere is...well there isn't any but on a nice summer's night, sitting on the patio outside sipping a beer and chowing down on some nachos and guacomole, who could ask for a better atmosphere?"}
{"text":"I've had street tacos from the hands of real Mexicans in Guadalajara and these are the closest thing I've had to that since! I've been going here for years.  Great service, great food, great value!"}
{"text":"I can't believe this place gets such rave reviews. My husband is Mexican and we are always looking for authentic Mexican food in and around Toronto. But boy this is not the place. We ordered the tacos al pastor, the tortillas were so soggy, the pineapple was not fresh, they were so overpriced, there are better places to get tacos. It's always so hard to find any place that gives complimentary nachos and salsa dip or guac, since they offered neither, we ordered the guacamole for $7 what a steep price, and completely not worth it. But I guess this was a first time thing (and last), and I won't be so naive to go off of yelp reviews when trying a place again. I was really hoping they had flan but alas I am still on the hunt since they did not offer it here. Sadly I won't be going back to El Trompo. 1/10 I do not recommend this place at all for a satisfying Mexican experience. I feel sorry for all those people that think this place is amazing and a good deal, when they do not realize they are being ripped off and taken for a ride.."}
{"text":"Donald Trompo loves this place. But that doesn't mean you can't too. Just don't let him grab you by the taco.

What to get: Um, Tacos. OK.

It's not their fault that I am so picky about my Mexican food. Having had the best of the best in San Diego, Los Angeles, Houston, and in Mexico itself, I expect a lot from a Trompo taco. It's one of my favourite kinds. Comes from the Monterrey area, and is wildly popular in Houston, which is right at the top of the highway down to Monterrey.

Never expected to find this kind of thing up in Toronto, but gave it a try. Massive brownie points for being fairly cheap (compared to Seven Lives around the corner), and for having absolutely wonderful service from the guy and the girl both. Cute people, too (hi!). The taste was good, it was nice and juicy, I was all about it.

I suppose the only reason I dock 1 star is that it wasn't the best authentic Mexican, it was a little Anglicized, Americanized, or Canadianized if you prefer. Wasn't particularly meaty or filling, not that it has to be. And Trompo is usually sliced off the big rotating thing, as is Pastor, but they don't actually have Trompo, they sell Pastor (the more generic Mexican version heavy on the Pineapple). It wasn't sliced directly off the spindle thingy, and I've had much better pastors (such as at my church).

Still, much closer to real Mexican food than anything else I've ever tried anywhere in Canada. Can't get much higher of a compliment than that."}
{"text":"The al pastor tacos were excellent - the meat was cooked perfectly and I was full after eating five bite-sized tacos. The prices were also very reasonable as well! Definitely worth a visit on a nice sunny, summery day."}
{"text":"I really like Mexican food because of the variety of salsas and spices. 

The nice thing of this place is that the people making the food are actually Mexican! The food is very good, and they have the typical drinks from Mexico that I like. They have different levels of spiciness which was great because I will different types of food at different spicy levels. Plus the home made tortillas were great. 

During the summer I like to sit outside as it can get very hot inside. I have gone back 3 times now."}
{"text":"I wish I had read the reviews BEFORE trying this place...didn't have my BB with me (shock)!  Rookie mistake.

Ok, anyone who knows me, knows I look my food spicy, so when I ordered their Tinga - Spicy Chicken soft tacos I was super excited.

Service was speedy, I mean, speedy, like I placed my order, grabbed a seat and the server brought me my tacos.  Yeah, THAT fast!

It pains me to say this, but at $9 and change, what a disappointment...they were bland, flavourless and small.  The salsas were pretty watery and had a very soupy consistency.  It's not to say that I didn't 'enjoy' the food, but I've had way better.  I was expecting authentic Mexican and I got something that was trying really had to be that, but failing in an epic way.

Needless to say I won't return.  Too expensive and bland for my taste."}
{"text":"Authentic, cheap, and absolutely delicious. El Trompo has the flavour of all the new trendy Mexican spots while costing a fraction of the price. 

Came here for a weekday lunch. It's a nice, small spot with a few patio seats. I'm guessing during dinner times it gets much more crowded. 

Tacos are about $10 for 5 pieces. Incredible value. I had their al pastor tacos and it was beautiful. I had the first taco and was in love. For the second taco I added their salsa verde and started crying tears of joy. For the rest I added their hot sauce as well and I was in nirvana. We also had the gringa quesadilla and it was so damn good. The cheese in it was perfect. 

If you want delicious food for great value, come here."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service ! With quality authentic Mexican taste and great vibes from Kensington market ! The service felt like you were sitting in a Mexican home ! Beautiful ! 

You gotta eat here !"}
{"text":"I'm Mexican and I can honestly tell you that that this is the closest traditional Mexican food that I have tried in Toronto.
I've been coming here for the last few years (pretty much since they opened) 
All the staff it's super friendly.

My fav are:
alambre de pastor  
Guacamole 
Agua de horchata
Michelada preparada con negra modelo 
Café de olla 
Pastel de mango

I work in the Industry and I'm always recommending this place, it's super casual and great for brunch, the margaritas are REALLY really good... And pretty much I love it all, one of my favourite restaurants."}
{"text":"Can I say dirty mexican on yelp? What if I prefaced it with it's the best dirty mexican in town?

With all these fancy taco places popping up across the city, it's nice to see El Trompo isn't adding bespoke tacos to their menu.

Their el pastor is the stuff of legends... marinated pork (legend has it they marinate it for 3 days), skewered with pineapple, slow roasted on a spit and shaved off like shawarma. And out of all the taco places, of all price ranges, I'd say El Trompo has the best corn tortillas in the city.

I'm not as big a fan of their guacamole especially compared to more chunky guacamole's in the city hence 4 stars instead of 5 but their chips are delicious!

The location feels a bit like a beach side taco hut, complete with lack of air conditioning replaced with constantly running fans in the summer.

Service was too fast to be friendly but they were always polite.

It's definitely an eat and go type place."}
{"text":"Dining Experience: Dinner
Venue: El Trompo
Specialty: Tacos
Menu items: Guacamole + Queso Fundido + Tacos al Pastor
Drink Pairing:  Michelada (Beer with lime juice and salt)

If you are looking to go to Mexico but find yourself short on money or time, then look no further than Kensigton market in Toronto. There, you will find El Trompo, a place that will transport you to the country that defies spiciness.

As I am waiting for my girlfriends to arrive at El Trompo, I decide to order a Michelada. The place is warm, welcoming and on a hot summer night like this, blasting all possible fans available.  Yet the heat of the night has overtaken this place. But it is not an uncomfortable heat, is one of those smooth, pleasant, relaxing and breeze kind of heat. 
As I sip my beer and look around the place with its fans, Mexican inspired decor and the Spanish speaking staff;  I realize, I am no longer in Toronto...the next 2 hours, I will be visiting Mexico city, and this will only cost me a mere $15-$20.

This is not the first time I come to El Trompo, in fact I am a regular here. So my menu plans have already been decided and selected from the moment we planned coming here. My Mexican night then starts off with some lovely guacamole...


....according to my friends, this is the best guacamole they have ever had, and I will have to concur. The \"gauc\" is fresh, chunky and smooth. The tomatoes are visible, which makes it even more fresh.  With it comes some corn tortilla chips, which according to the owner, Lucero, are especially brought from Mexico. And for those of you who would want to have more of these, they also sell them at the restaurant by the bag. 

Next up, my lovely Queso Fundido or Molten cheese.  This is a special Mexican white cheese, melted and covered with sauteed mushrooms. I have yet to guess what kind of sauce they use on the mushrooms, but the whole dish, is just delish.

The Queso comes with flour tortillas, which you then use to spread the cheese and mushrooms on, wrap it up and proceed to eat it. Yum.

Next up, my favourite and El Trompo's most ordered dish, Tacos al Pastor!

The tacos come in an authentic corn tortilla with pork marinated in a special traditional Mexican sauce. The pork has a kick to it, but it's not spicy. If you want to add heat, just turn to the salsas on the table - Verde or Roja (green or red sauce), they are both amazing, just one spicier than the other.  
Back to the tacos, on top of the lovely pork comes pineapple, onions and coriander (also known as cilantro).  All tacos are served with a lime on the side. In Mexico, the formal way to eat tacos is to squeeze the lime in before you eat them. The tacos are great as they are, but once you sprinkle the lime juice on them, then the real party begins in your mouth. Is as though the sourness turns on the marinate from the pork and makes the flavours come together. Exquisite!

My night finished off with some sweet churros and cafe the olla (coffee made on a pot). Overall, a great dining experience.

Thanks to Lucero for being such an awesome restauranteur and for bringing this lovely place to our sometimes cold city!  

Buen Provecho."}
{"text":"Their horchata is great. $1.75 for a small and $3.5 for a regular although you can only get a regular for take-out.

Their nachos looked amazing on the counter, so I'll definitely be back for a meal sometime!"}
{"text":"It's difficult to find authentic Mexican food in this city riddled with mediocre \"burrito\" restaurants. As an ex-Californian, my love affair for Mexican food knows no bounds. 

Good thing my boxing instructor, Rey Morales, suggested Eltrompo in Kensington Market. They serve Mexico City style tacos filled with wonderful things like bistec, chicken tinga, and pork. Guacamole is awesome with just the right combination of tang and creaminess. I'd pass on the fajitas as the vegetable/meat ratio is unbalanced. But I will always order their Tres Leches cake. Staff is friendly and relaxed. You leave with a full and happy belly and with money to spare."}
{"text":"I love this little place. And as I am working just about two minutes walk away, I get to enjoy the deliciousness that is the ElTrompo taco whenever I feel like it. 

Pico de gallo tends to be better in summer (fresher tomatoes) but is always zingy with lime and chili. Guacamole is creamy, and laced with diced tomatoes. Tacos are wonderful, juicy and just the right size. 

Talking of size, I am a tall guy with a big appetite and I have never left the place hungry. Yes, tacos are the authentic silver dollar size, but one order and maybe a soup is enough to keep me more than happy. If you're used to supersizing your meal, then El Trompo might not be for you, otherwise I'm sure you'll be ok. 

Table cloth is plastic, so are the plates. But the beer is cold, the food is fresh, the prices are low and the service could not be friendlier if they tried."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars for Mexican food in Toronto. Not much was open when I visited on a Wed night but this place was decent and had outdoor seating on the sidewalk. Had some soft tacos which I don't remember what it was called.. Was good."}
{"text":"Muy bueno. The tacos are not too expensive and taste real good. Definitely recommend the house specialty al pastor tacos. Great atmosphere inside and a friendly staff as well!"}
{"text":"A little hole in the wall restaurant in Kensington that serves amazing tacos el pastor, grilled cheese and tacos tinga. Staff is really friendly and sweet."}
{"text":"I am Mexican. And I know for sure this tacos are not a good Mexican dish. Corn tortillas served here are poor quality. Not traditional Mexican food at all."}
{"text":"Average tacos/tortillas. I got a fish taco & a mushroom tortilla and they tasted good but nothing amazing in my opinion. If you're stuck between the mushroom taco vs. the mushroom tortilla, go for the taco! It comes with 5 small tacos rather than one large tortilla -  pretty much tastes the same and you get more. I really liked the way they cooked their mushrooms so I would still come back for that but I've had better fish tacos. Also, I would stay away from the cheese tortilla since it's super bland. Oh and they only take cash if you spend less than $10"}
{"text":"Food was great, bulldog margarita was slightly deadly--in a good way! I recommend it highly and will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"This was one of those \"iffy\" moments while I was on my food crusade that evening. The reviews are somewhat glowing but the space appeared anything but; I'm not used to this to say the least. There's nothing hip and rustic or new age about this place. It's old, worn, not too inviting and comically decorated with an assortment of Mexican pieces.

However, if you can put all that behind you, what we have here might just be the hidden Mexican fast food gem that the TDOT has neglected. One glance at this place and you sense that this is a family run business with a chef that is not in tune with the latest taco trends. She doesn't care for $8 tacos with Asian inspired spices and exotic meats. No fancy shells made for the latest gluten free, high fibre, zero calorie vegan. No, there's none of that here. What you do get is perhaps someone's nonna who has been cooking and perfecting this stuff probably since she was 10 years old. Someone who does not have a culinary degree nor does she care for one. She needs not have the approval from food critics or celebrity chefs, she only cares that people (like me and you) just eat it - lots of it!

Yes, this is minimalistic tacos at it's finest. Bright, full-flavour, juicy, tender, warm and fresh is how I would describe them. There's that perfect balance of salty meats, sweet vegetables and fresh herbs all wrapped up in a pillowy, warm, home-made shell. A fresh squeeze of lime to cut that fattiness with a few dollops of that green enchilada and salsa provides brightness. Yes, it's a balance bite EVERY BITE. Amazingly it doesn't end there. Even well after your bite of deliciousness you are left with a long lasting flavour of that excellent fresh made taco shell in your mouth."}
{"text":"Pretty authentic mexican. Love the corn truffle quesadilla. Great place, been there a dozen times or more."}
{"text":"Ive been here many years ago, and here recently.

Food is great, especially the nachos, and the avocado dip.
And the green chili sauce they serve! (I could drink a litre of it! [anyone know what it might be called?])

This place is great, only tip is bring water with yourself. I remember seeing locals in there and they all had their own water to drink. From what I remember, I think my girlfriend said how her water tasted or smelled like washing liquid (they use plastic cups so it absorbs the chemicals). I drank it though :p

Visit this place, it's great and cheap!"}
{"text":"El Trompo is a Mexican place in Kengsington Market. It's probably my favourite Mexican place in the city. El Trompo makes a really good Guacamole that you would be remiss not to try if you do end up going. I normally get tacos when I eat there, as they are excellent. My friends all complain the portions are too small, which is probably true. I find them good enough for me. Regardless, the dishes are quite cheap so you can just order a lot of stuff if you have a big appetite. There are lots of interesting dishes to try on the menu. This place is definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Delicioso!!! hand down best authentic tacos I've ever had in the city of Toronto! def. not your fancy spot to impress a first date, but I love coming here when craving good mex food. Super awesome, Super people, Super delicious. Don't miss a trip to El Trompo if you are in Kensington."}
{"text":"Came here with a couple of friends for dinner. After a short wait for patio seats we had some drinks. The lime margaritas were okay, seemed like they came from a machine. The food was excellent. We ordered 4 different kinds of tacos to share and they were all great. The service was very fast.

We will all return."}
{"text":"I can make a better taco and I have never made a taco. This place has all the atmosphere (summer only because of the patio) with no food worth trying. I've given them 2 chances and the food was not good. They are consistent though being that the food tasted the just as bland both times."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend in search for an authentic Mexican cuisine experience, and most certainly was not disappointed!  This spot is a little more dingy than your usual Mexican place, but it's an acceptable level especially considering it's in the Kensington area.  That's no slight to Kensington either; its unique homey charm never fails to incite feelings of coziness.  

I ordered the beef Alambres, which is essentially a beef stir-fry with green and red peppers, onions, and cheese, served alongside fresh tortillas.  I was very impressed with this tasty dish, and it really hit the spot!  My only criticism is my churro arrived a little cold.  I was hoping to get a fresh one but I guess the kitchen was really busy that day.  I definitely will be back here in the future next time I am in the Kensington area.  Fantastic food and service!"}
{"text":"In the heat-a, you can't beat-a
Their mango margarita.
And holy fricken moly,
That's some tasty guacamole,
Oh me-oh, oh my-oh
Pass me the pico de gaillo.
The only thing that's bad-io?
Squishy little patio."}
{"text":"When we walked in the place was packed and I was worried that we would be here waiting a long time for service, boy was I surprised, our food came very quickly and we were served by a very friendly waitress. We had the pico de gallo nachos and they were tasty, the fish tacos were good but the pulled pork taco special was pretty dry. I would go back to try other selections on their menu."}
{"text":"I second the sentiments of Jennifer K. Tis restaurant is definitely one of the better establishments in terms of Mexican food and authenticity, but the food really didn't have any Wow factor.

Guacamole is great, the huevos are ok, and the burritos/tacos are ok but IMO way too small for the price you pay. They fairly inexpensive in general, but the meals are appetizer portions and I just can't seem to be fully satiated on that alone."}
{"text":"Mexican food is one of my favorite foods, but for lack of quality Mexican establishments in the city that don't cost $10 a taco, I don't go often. It's also kind of an every once in awhile thing for me, which makes it pop a bit more when I get it.

Anyhow, this little spot in Kensington gets pretty busy, and there's a good reason why: Good tacos at reasonable prices! I had three different types, the one with spicy pork I wasn't a big fan of but the chicken and the beef were pretty amazing. For around $10 you get 6 or 8 tacos. Love the fresh soft shells and the lime that it comes with. And they have this Mexican pineapple soda that's pretty much 80% pure cane sugar but astonishingly good!

They sit you quickly, and the service is also kept at that pace. Not overly friendly but still friendly, and the setting is decidedly casual, just my thing. 

Go on pedestrian Sunday and you can mosey around after to check out the many coffee shops in the area. Even in winter, your full belly will thank you for this decision!"}
{"text":"Had the tacos al pastor (it was recommended as the house special) along with some guacamole and chips.

The verdict:

The guacamole tasted fresh, but seemed to lack lime juice and any spices to give it sufficient flavour.

The pork tacos were ok (the order included five small tacos and cost $9.75), but the meet was dry. The green salsa (tomatillo?) helped provide a little moisture.

Service here is a bit above average. The outside patio is nice, but can be too warm on summer days.

All in all the meal was pretty good, but quickly neared the 20$ price range after tax and tip. (Actually, had I not split the guacamole my meal would have been over 20$). Although Toronto has a king's ransom in overpriced decent restaurants, Kensington Market is the last place you need to spend twenty dollars for lunch."}
{"text":"You are spoiled for choice when you are in the Kensington Area, so a good rule of thumb is to see where the crowd is and pick accordingly. The small patio in front of this small restaurant was constantly packed with people, even in the later hours of the evening. Luckily, the service here is great and moved quickly to get us a patio table within 10 minutes of walking in. 

I was excited to see some unique choices on the menu. A lot of tables were having some delicious looking Margaritas, but we went for the Tamarind and the Horchata drinks instead. The Tamarind as tart, crisp and refreshing while the Horchata is like rich almond milk with hints of cinnamon and spices. Both are delicious and thirst quenching on a hot summer night. 

For food, you can't go wrong with the classic Al Pastor. You get 5 tortillas with chunks of well seasoned meat and fresh flavor. It's good by itself, with a squeeze of lime or even liberally douse with the sauces on the table. If you are feeling adventurous, try the Huitlaconche Quezadilla. It packs a large punch of mushroom flavor with bright spots of sweet corn in between the thin tortillas. Maybe google what it is actually after the meal....."}
{"text":"I finally got to El Trompo Taco Bar after hearing so many people talk about the amazing guacamole that they serve there.

My friend and I ordered the following:
1) GUACAMOLE + CHIPS: It was AMAZING, I fell in love with it.  It's so hard to find good guacamole in the GTA.  Even my Mexican friend said it was legit.  We loved it so much that we had to add it to everything (even our tacos).

2) AL PASTOR TACOS: Pulled pork? No complaints here.  Add a bit of guacamole or hot sauce, and you're good to go.

3) GUAVA MARGARITA, LIME MARGARITA: Lime margarita was amazing - much better than the guava margarita.

Overall experience? Amazing.  The only problem was that we went on a really hot day, and it was a bit stuffy inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"I think my expectations for El Trompo were a little too high because of all the reviews I read previous to my trip.

Don't get me wrong, the experience overall, was still great. I sat outside on the patio, which is very small, yet extremely charming. 

We started with the guac and chips - a must. I can confidently state that it was the best guacamole I had ever tasted. If you are one for chunkier dips, this isn't for you. The texture was extremely creamy, it mimicked butter.

Next up, I ordered the chicken tinga. I'll be honest, it wasn't my favourite, but they were very reasonably priced (5 for $10). I was expecting it to be a lot more spicy, so I topped each taco with a mound of what seemed to be homemade hot sauce. The flavour was pretty underwhelming, but I can say that the tortillas were great. 

Not much to say about the margaritas other than the fact that they were tasty and super festive.

One last thing I want to add is that I was heartbroken to find out that the churros were only served on weekends. Quite a tragedy. My heart, however, has mended and I will be back to get a taste of these fried goodies!"}
{"text":"always walking by and never going in... big mistake!

i went here for the first time the other day and found the food amazing.  i ordered the the al pastor tacos, my friend had the chicken tacos and we split some guacamole.  everything tasted great.  the food wasn't as spicy as i thought it could be for a mexican restaurant, but it's spicy enough for your occasional spice dabbler.

this is a small and cozy place, located in an amazing area.  i'll be back here for my mexican cravings for sure."}
{"text":"Looks great, taste good. Had the fish taco but with the double tortilla threw me off. I ate it with one afterwards. I felt like it was lacking some flavouring but the fish was very good. Nice outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Authentic, delicious, and reasonably priced. We stopped by on a Friday evening and found the place to be very lively, packed and busy. Note that decor looks straight out of the 80's (think bright yellow... everywhere), worn and plain, but still quite homey and inviting. 

First, the parking situation. There's free street parking on Nassau Street just south of the restaurant, if you can manage to find an available spot.

Second, the food. We weren't too hungry and ordered to share, a) the Bistec tacos (4 generous sized tacos for $9.75),  and b) the Guacamole ($7.00). Overall, everything was super delicious. We would definitely get the Guacamole again - great kick, flavour, and depth. The tacos were above-average and different from beef-filled tacos we've had in the city. Grilled and marinated in a variety of different spices, the meat had a very unique flavour and it was a treat to have. The tortilla was soft and went well with the meat, but I think I would have preferred a hard shell. Overall, generous portions, friendly service. Don't let the drab decor fool you - this is legit, authentic-tasting Mexican food that you won't regret having.

For the tacos and the guacamole, with tax and tip, we paid around $24.00."}
{"text":"Y U look so promising but fail to deliver what I expect of U????

Tiny place in Kensington. Looks like a nice hidden gem that has authentic tasty food. Went with some friends and were very excited to try the food. The menu looks interesting too, with a bunch of stuff we have never tried before. 
Guacamole was really good, but $7 per order, seriously? Huitlacoche quesadilla, ie corn truffle quesadilla, was special, but all I tasted was the corn tortilla. Yes, that is how not so flavourful it is. I got myself some bistec tacos (beef). Again, how can the taste of tortilla overwhelm my mouth, instead of my umami taste? I guess they have good tortillas..... With every bite I had, the more I wanted to go back to Playa Cabana and get the Tacos Al Pastor.  

All in all, it is a cute place and have this family-run mexican place feel to it. Will I go back? Maybe, but if Im already in Kensington, I have other better places to go to.

PS. The salsa verde was very good and it saved my meal!!!"}
{"text":"It's nice to finally find a place in Toronto that reminds me of good taquerias in Chicago.  And we stumbled on it by accident, as a restaurant we has planned to go to because of Yelp reviews has too long a wait.

The tacos are wonderful, everyhting is home cooked and guacomole was perfect.  

No atmosphere to speak of - it's a joint.  But prompt and friendly service and great food.

I wish there was a sit-down Mexican restaurant here run by real Mexicans who could cook more substantial fare as well as these people cook tacos."}
{"text":"Guacamole and nachos no cheese just natural and home cooked amazing. They have veggie option which is nice mushroom and cheese. If you eat meat they have options choose out 3 items. 
Ok they all come small portion size 5 tacos on one platter but for vegetarians there is no option you have to go with one only. On the other hand i tried pulled pork, beef and chicken. Honestly i didnt like the beef one but rest was all amzing. However, they have more choices like fish tacos and in desserts CHURROS which is available only on Saturday and Sunday.
You can decide to eat in or out at patio. Its located rite next to fat burritos in Kensington market.
More in drinks to explore but we preferred water instead. Will go there again yes and environment is nice just like a family. Yes i would recommend to give a try"}
{"text":"The portions were small but to be fair, the price was inexpensive. Busy place and the seating was somewhat cramped. Overall, it was alright."}
{"text":"I should've known better than to have Mexican food in Canada when I live in the Mexican food capitol of the U.S. - Los Angeles. 

My friend and I visited Toronto for the first time and after passing up on a bunch of great eateries in the Kensington Market, we hangrily decided to have Mexican. 

I had the alambres de pollo which is like chicken fajitas with melted cheese on top. They provide you with tortillas and you can make tacos out of the alambres. The alambres had a sweet after taste that didn't sit well with me. I hate mixing savory and sweet with my food unless it's Caribbean or Thai cuisine. This just didn't taste right. It wasn't disgusting but it wasn't good either. I had no choice but to finish up what I purchased because we were on a time crunch and couldn't grab anything else to eat. Prior to our meals, we had guac and chips, which was the only thing that was good. I also ordered a margarita. Okay y'all, save yourself some money and just buy a beer. The margarita tasted like a slushy. It was extremely sweet and had no alcohol. I couldn't finish it. They should just call it a Mexican slushy because margaritas aren't supposed to taste like that. 

My friend and I left full but unsatisfied. We should've known better than to have Mexican. Should've had Italian, Portuguese  or plain Canadian fare. Oh well. Never again!"}
{"text":"As authentic as it gets.

Discovered this place a few months ago, and have become my weekly lunch spots immediately. They serve a variety of tacos, ranging from chorizo to vegetarian, and each order comes with 5 flavorful tacos wrapped in corn tortillas. I got to say, the taste is absolutely mind-blowing as the corn tortilla perfectly compliments the juicy seasoned fillings. 

But perhaps one of the best features of the place is that they keep their prices low. You get 5 tacos for around $9, which cost next to nothing if you compare it to Seven Lives down the street (they sell their tacos for $5-6 for one taco). 

Their service and decor is great, I always feel so welcome around the friendly staff."}
{"text":"If you like authentic Mexican this is the place to go. My husband is from Mexico and he said this is the best Mexican restaurant in the city. The margaritas are so good and reasonably priced. Definitely get the fried cheese as an app, it is to die for. I would drive to the city just for that !! Amazing little place"}
{"text":"Good food, good prices, authentic flavors of Mexico.
None of the fancy silliness that other \"Mexican\" restaurants in Toronto offer, it's just straight-forward food with straight forward Spanish-speaking servers."}
{"text":"The tacos here are fairly good but for price and taste, I prefer some of the other taco joints in the neighbourhood. But I would recommend this place for the atmosphere. I love the vibe of this place compared to the rest. It's like going to dinner at your Mexican friend's home. Great place to grab food and hangout with friends."}
{"text":"Superb preparation and super food. Loved the presentation and the taste. The quantity of food served compared to the cost is certainly awesome and worth it.

Would give 3 stars for the ambience and interior. It's a nice place to eat on the go that offers a variety of vegetarian options combined with superb taste."}
{"text":"Originally from Long Beach and Orange County where al pastor tacos are king, I was looking for something relatively comparable. 

Only a block from my house, I walked over and greeted the cooks up in the front and ordered the al pastor which only comes in 5 tacos for $10, which isn't too bad $2 a pop. The older lady was very nice of course and I struck up a conversation in full spanish with her (wanted to brush up on my spanish) while waiting for my tacos. 

Conclusion: Al pastor tacos were dry. Had to drench those things with the verde salsa that it comes with and tapatio sauce. They were good not amazing like the tacos back home. They were just dry. Not a lot of fat juicy and spicyness like most tacos you get in the socal area. 

Even with the tacos being dry, atmosphere was great and people were nice. Hope to become a regular."}
{"text":"Huge disappointment. Seems deceptively cheap, but way overpriced for what you get. 

Lured in by the people on the patio with the huge, festive looking margaritas. I am a huge sucker for the alcohol + patio combo. Got roped into ordering food too. Their tacos aren't better than the mom and pop places across the street. Their nachos are pretty nasty - the pico de gallo tastes like it came out of a can, and there was barely anything on our nachos except sweaty cheese and maybe a spoonful of refried beans. Food gets a solid F.

The margarita was also pretty disappointing - tasted like it came right out of a mix or a packaged margarita syrup. It had ice in it but it wasn't cold, which made for a weird drinking experience. Didn't have a lot of boooze in it either, which made me sad. Also, HORROR OF ALL HORRORS it was rimmed with sugar, not salt! eww

One extra star for the patio - it was reallly cramped. They tried to fit way too many people into a small space."}
{"text":"I went to El Trompo for brunch and actually loved it. The customer service was excellent, with waitresses frequently checking in on us and having great attitude.

I had the chorizo breakfast and it was seasoned wonderfully and I found the portion great for a brunch menu. It also comes with coffee, which is a plus.

I also ordered the churro, which was drizzled in chocolate sauce. It was delicious, only improvement would be if it was served hot.

Overall. I definitely recommend this place for brunch."}
{"text":"This place is a great staple.  The food isn't fancy or mind-blowing, but it's also not expensive and you get a lot of it.  Service is friendly and fast.  I found my margarita a bit heavy on the salt and light on the lime, but not so much that it would stop me from getting it again."}
{"text":"I absolutely am a fan of this place.  They serve authentic mexican food that you would find in any good taqueria in Lower Texas or Northern Mexico.  My only true disappointment is that they do not make their own tortillas....and they do not serve tamales or barbacoa which are staples of any good mexican food restaurant.  I do not understand the lack of serving these things b/c they are in the heart of my I call \"little mexico\" in Kensington Market.  Otherwise they have good typical mexican breakfast foods and a must try are their grilled bistec con queso tacos."}
{"text":"Guys...I really cannot seem to get past spending more than 8 bucks a pop on mexican food...that being said,I dont live in California anymore and should stop whining...

We ordered the guacamole as recommended by many of the yelpers...wasnt ringing any bells for me, this could be because its winter and maybe avocados arent as good then, i dont know? It would have been better if the tortilla chips were warm though. We ordered the beef and cheese tacos and the chicken tacos and both were good and flavorful but not satisfying my taste buds if you know what I mean......maybe a salsa/condiments bar is something to think about. if you have the pickled veggies you can get at some mexican places it will change your life!

The service was great and the waitress was really pleasant."}
{"text":"We visitied here last Sunday and I have to say it was just a terrific meal. I had the Tinga spicy chicken tacos, and my dining partner had the pork tacos with grilled pineapple. The side salsas were also very authentic and very tasty. The salsa verde was so good, I could have drank it. The red salsa was medium spiced with chipoltes, I believe and was the bomb. The pico de gallo was also great. 9.75 for 5 small tacos and 6 bucks for a Negra Modelo and I was set. 5 tacos is more than enough to fill you. A definite return spot for sure! The service was friendly and fast as well. Authentic Mexican for sure!!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. When we were there it was pretty disorganized with communication, they couldn't give proper directions. The staff could be a bit friendlier."}
{"text":"*restaurant was tiny and at best it can sit around 20 people.
*Coming here for brunch on a Saturday, the patio was packed with customers and a little bit cramped, thus you should get here really early as there was a line up by the time I left.

-Horchata (made from rice, vanilla, cinnamon and milk) - $1.75 for small
Personally the drink was a tad too sweet for me but the flavor was really interesting! The horchata was milky, had a nutty taste and a hint of cinnamon. It was the perfect refreshing drink for a hot summer day so I recommend getting this!

-Corn truffle/Huitlacoche Corn Quesadillas - $5.99
Corn truffle is essentially a fungus and supposedly it's very nutritious. I don't recommend you guys to search up for the picture of it lol.. This is my first time having this dish so I didn't know what kind of flavors to expect. To be honest it tasted like a very earthy mushroom and the texture was a bit mushy, but I didn't think the flavor was mind-blowing. 

-Fish taco (Fried fish served with Mexican coleslaw, pico de gallo and a signature sauce) - $5/each
My favorite! There were nice chunks of fish in the taco and they were cooked perfectly, not oily and it didn't have too much batter either. Though the fish was a bit too salty for my taste, the spicy signature sauce overpowered the dish but that's why there were fresh pico de gallo and lemon juice to help

-Al Pastor Taco (Pork meat marinated in the traditional sauce, served on corn tortillas with pineapple, coriander and onion) - $9.75
You get 5 tacos for $10 which I think was a great value! Unfortunately the pork was really dry and bland so I inquired the server, which resulted into me receiving a glare from her and she dropped (literally dropped) the new order onto our table without saying anything. The new ones were incredibly fresh, pork meat was juicy and had good spices. The taco as a whole was not too spicy as the fish taco and the pineapple helped to ease the heat. Unfortunately while the taco shell was freshly made, it fell apart while I tried to eat :(."}
{"text":"Nice little spot at the end of Augusta Ave.  El Trompo doesn't \"trumpo\" the competition but what they lack in quality and fixings they make up for in quantity.  It's hard to compare this place to the likes of 7 Lives but it sure has it's appeal.  I'll give these guys a 3/5 because the guac was creamy, fresh and had a hint of onion.  The chicken taco was a bit dry but adding the side order of guac and \"green sauce\" helped."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink and lunch today.  The mango magarita was delicious and quite refreshing; I tasted a hint of sugarcane juice in there or something similiar which I loved! We ordered the pulled pork taco and chorizo taco and they tasted great. We smothered them in the green and red sause available on the table. The atmosphere was warm and friendly, felt alot like being down south on vacation."}
{"text":"The only really good Mexican I've had in Toronto. Get the Tacos Al Pastor (their \"specialty\"), or ask them to give you a variety if you want to try a few different tastes. And if you're really hungry, start with some chips and guacamole. Priced \"moderate\" because tacos + beer = over $10, but really, for the quality of food, I would call this place a bargain."}
{"text":"Best authentic Mexican street tacos in the city. If you want weird delicious fish tacos California style this is not your place. Those are also delicious but not the same. 
The staff is always very nice and the food is good.
Also. Amazing chipotle sauce."}
{"text":"Why is it that people give such good reviews to such dirty restaurants. If the front of the restaurant is filthy that should really scare you what the prep area looks like. Well I'm here now and I pray I don't get sick. I'm waiting for my taco.....Oh my God this place is SO BAD. Has yelp been hacked somehow? because that's the only way this place should be getting a good review."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I have had in the city so far. Got the Tacos Al Pastor and a Mango Margarita. The tacos were light and fresh and the margarita was amazing. Everything was delicious! Would definitely recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I give this place four stars for the authenticity. I don't know many places in Toronto that will serve jamaica (a mexican herbal juice), huitlacoche (mexican version of truffle musrhoom) and zuccini blossom (literally, the top flower). 
The hot sauces are also exceptionally flavourful."}
{"text":"I was visiting Kensington Market in Toronto, and I read on a bunch of websites recommending El Trompo's tacos. As soon as I walked in, I could tell it was an authentic-style Mexican restaurant. There were lots of native, Spanish-speaking diners as well.

I tried the chuleta con queso upon the website recommendations and also got the pico de gallo to try. The meat was kind of dry, but maybe that's just how chuleta (pork chop) tastes. I've never had it before, so I can't make a good comparison. There are a couple of sauces on the table which made it better. The pico de gallo was alright. I thought it had a funky taste to it, but my boyfriend didn't seem to notice.

The menu has a variety of options, the food came out fast, and the service was friendly. Plus everything is affordable. However, I liked Seven Lives Tacos in Kensington a lot more. Seven Lives is more a fusion Mexican-American restaurant than El Trompo, but I thought the tacos there tasted better."}
{"text":"Had the tacos chorizo and al pastor, guacamole and chips.  The al pastor was a bit dry and chorizo was flavourless, saving grace was the onions and cilantro garnish.

The guac was smoothed to a paste, with chunks of tomato mixed in, and I prefer my guac chunky so I can see the avocados. 

You get 5 tacos for $10, which is great value, but the quality and flavour of the food should be significantly better."}
{"text":"REAL good Mexican food with great and friendly service  The price is good. So worth it! We had the guacamole and beef tacos which were perfect proportions. I will definitely go back and highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Love this place, love the friendly and courteous service and the food is authentic and prepared with care. Fave : tacos with huitloche and also the ones with zucchini flowers. Amazing guacamole too!!"}
{"text":"VIBE 
This place doesn't look like much on the outside- or the inside. It reminds me of old school Kensington Market, with its ramshackle sign and its checkered table cloths and chinzy Corona signage.  I'm not sure if the place is family run but the crew seem pretty close-knit. A hodgepodge of people come here - from students to couples to groups for birthday parties.  It doesn't matter. The food is good and their outdoor patio is one of THE BEST places to people watch. You're literally right in the heart of Kensington Market (just make sure to go shopping at Model Citizen BEFORE you eat!). 

I EAT 
I'm a creature of habit at El Trompo. Guacamole and chips as an appetizer;  tacos el pastor as a main.
The El Trompo guac recipe is one of my favourites in Toronto. I always eat this in one sitting and am not ashamed to say so. The avocado is super fresh and there is a right balance of ingredients in the guac. Splash a bit of lime on the guac and voila! Craving for life. 
 
The five mini pork taquitas are marinated and are Mexican city tacos. They've got a great spice to them and not over-accessorized with ingredients like most of the burrito places in town. The el pastor tacos also have pineapple sprinkled throughout and it adds a sweet tanginess to the spicy kick of the meat. Win-win.  
The meal is also reasonably priced: for a Corona, guac and taquita meal, it's about $25. 

Definitely on my top 10 Toronto eats list and one of my favourite places to have Mexican food.  Add that to the fact that you're in one of the most vibrant neighbourhoods in Toronto, equals a solid 8.5 out of 10 rating for me. 

A note: what is up with the music on the website (or websites in general)? That is so 1999. Stop. Please stop. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
This place \"el trompos\" the other Mexican restaurants in town. (I know. I need to stop this. But it's fun.)"}
{"text":"El Trompo provides \"authentic\" Mexican food.  I go back often, and it's usually for the Al Pastor tacos.  Delicious blend of pork, onion, and pineapple in soft shells.  Very good!  
I also really enjoy the Pico de Gallo, and Guacamole!  Food is consistently fresh every time I come here.

As for the Ambiance... 
If you're stuck inside the resto, it isn't the nicest place.  Better suited for a group of friends, or buddies.  Definitely not a date!
If you're lucky however, you'll get a seat outside on their very limited patio.  Great place to people watch.  Kensington is home to a lot of interesting characters, which just adds to the experience.

If you're a fan of mexican food, El Trompo is definitely worth a look."}
{"text":"My boyfriend is Mexican, we tried this place because I got one of those deals.  We tried it and he fell in love immediately.  It's been over 10 years since he's been back to Mexico, so when we found this place he was so happy.  The Taco's al pastor were as authentic as you can get outside of Mexico.  We also had Orchata which was fantastic, Tamarindo was very good and Jamaica was very nice!   

We now go there once a week...he LOVES it and I have to say it's pretty fantastic!  


Cost: 2 people, 1 apps, 2 mains, 2 drinks $40.
Food quality: 5/5
Food quantity: 5/5
Service: 4.5/5

Would I Go Again: Yup Yup Yup!"}
{"text":"I have searched far & wide for good tacos in Toronto.  Having been spoiled in the past by taco trucks in San Jose, authentic Tex Mex in Dallas and 'new mexican chili' in Albuquerque, I was excited to try the Mexican food eateries in Toronto.  Time after time, I was gravely disappointed.

The tacos were amazing.  Near-perfect.  I got 5 tiny tacos, 2 chorizo, 2 polla tinga and 1 al pastor.  They came with onions and corriander, which is exactly how they should come.  All I can say is that I wish I had known about this establishment a year ago when I moved here and saved myself the heartache of going to so many places that weren't even close.  But the journey in itself makes it so much more worth it."}
{"text":"On a scorching day last week, my friend and I were lucky enough to score a seat on the quaint sidewalk patio of El Trompo where the prime people watching location and the genuine service are bonuses to the delicious food. 

Either as a starter or a snack, the creamy guacamole ($6.75) served with crispy corn chips are sure to satisfy. They are so good that you just might start getting snack attacks for them specifically. The menu is impressive in variety and pretty much anything on it is a promising authentic experience in itself. Desperados beer ($5.50) and Jamaica floral infused fresh brewed iced-tea ($2/lg, $1/sm) are thirst quenching drinks sure not to disappoint either."}
{"text":"If you are like me, and don't like Cilantro/Coriander, this place is not for you.

Hubby  and I got an order of the Tacos Al Pastor with Cilantro and Chorizo Tacos without Cilantro.

Sure, the tortillas were fresh made, which is nice, but the meat fillings were very dry and the Al Pastor did not have a lot of flavour.  I realize sometimes simple is best, but in this case we found simple was just plain and uninspiring.  

It might be authentic, but so is El Sol, and their food explodes with flavour, not only that, at El Sol you get a lot more food for the money than you do at El Trompo.  5 tiny tacos for around $10, with no sides?

Oh, and the runny Guacamole and hard tortilla chips at El Trompo tasted like Taco Bell compared to El Sol's chunkier more flavourful version.

The nail in the coffin was the Flan... covered in cheap chocolate sauce... whaaaa?  

Sorry El Trompo, but we won't be back."}
{"text":"Having difficulting deciding between a 3 and a 4-star rating. The portions are moderately sized but I wish they were a little bigger. Still a fair price, excellent service, cute little place with upbeat, colourful interior.

Had a small horchata (mind you, very small - a few gulps worth), shared a plate of relatively mediocre nachos, and the pork chop Al Pastor - a plate of goodness with 8 small tortillas for us to wrap. There was extra filling at the end. Everything was good, but not mindblowing for Mexican.

Total for two, satiated but not full - was just under $30 including tip. Would I return? No. It's alright I suppose, but not super special. Seven Lives down the street has way more flavourful tacos that are larger, for a better price. There is a nice unassumingness about El Trompo that is quite refreshing and authentic, however."}
{"text":"I'm Mexican and I've been trying a lot of Mexican restaurants in Toronto, but non of them were like El trompo, it is the best Mexican restaurant, the tacos are really tasty, actually all the food is really good, the guac is amazing and if you try it with a lime Margarita... ¡Simply delicious!  

The service is awesome, they are super friendly and fast. 

For sure I'll be back..."}
{"text":"Meh. 

That basically sums up my recent experience at El Trompo. Sure, the food was decent, and I appreciate the variety of jarritos available, but the service was blah and the whole thing was just overpriced. 

On the servers recommendation, I tried the first tacos on the list, with pork and pineapple (the name escapes me). They were alright, but kind of dry and really nothing special. I topped it with the guacamole that we were up-sold (I'm still not quite sure how that happened!).

When the bill came, I was pretty shocked - the guac was a whole $7!! For a tiny bowl!! Considering I didn't really want it in the first place, I was pretty unhappy. 

We also had to spend quite a bit of time getting our servers attention for water and the bill. 

Overall, not so impressed."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and while I've enjoyed the food, the cost of it really stung on this last outing.

I typically order the tacos al pastor, quesadilla de queso (which is cheese melted in a corn tortilla) and horchata.  $20.  

Too much for small servings."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant inside Kensington Market Location with two of my friends to finish off a great Saturday in the city! What a treat! It was a little hard to find the place because it is upstairs on the 3rd level, but it was well worth the effort to find it! Excellent food and service, not to mention the rum drinks! Wonderful Paella. I had the seafood and one of my friends had the one with chicken and chorizo...great smokey taste! Skirt steaks seemed popular and looked great. Avacado salad was good too! It's not cheap to eat there, but not super expensive either... depends on what you order and your choice of cocktails. Service was excellent ,. but we did have to wait about 30 minutes to be seated on a busy Saturday PM. Would be fun in the summer since there is an open deck that looks over the waterfront. Great Hispanic Food!"}
{"text":"We stopped into El Trompo for a quick and cheap meal before a movie and were not disappointed.

We started with an order of the guacamole ($6.75) and the pico de gallo ($3.99).  Both come with an bowl of chips.  We then ordered 3 different tacos - Al Pastor, Chorizo and Bistec (beef) all reasonably priced at $9.75 each.  For drinks, we got a beer and two Jarritos sodas (love the lime flavour).

Food came fast and hot.  I found the chorizo tacos a bit on the spicy side but still good.  We sat at a table at the back of the restaurant and I think it was close to the washroom because the scent of washroom sanitizer wafted by a couple of times while we ate - not appetizing.

The waitress was kind enough to provide not only separate bills but also divided up the price of the appetizers by 3 as well.  

Dinner and non-alcoholic drink plus tax and tip for under $20."}
{"text":"After eating at El Trompo and at other Taco/burrito joints in town, I've come to realize that if El Trompo serves authentic Mexican chow, I would rather eat the less authentic fare they serve at \"Tex-Mex\" or \"Plasti-Mex\" joints around town. It's not a shot at El Trompo or at true Mexican cuisine but more of a revelation that El Trompo helped me find. 

I ordered the chorizo tacos because I love me some sausage. It was good but nothing out of this world. The side of nachos we had were also tasty but it was hardly anything to get excited about. All in all the food was alright but the what really got to me was what we paid. I'm no cheapskate but it was hard for me to pay  over ten dollars for a bunch of tiny tacos and a serving of chips. I thought tacos were street food made with the cheap but yummy parts of an animal? I guess this place proved me wrong.  

I know my review doesn't seem super positive but with all the great talk this place gets I promise myself I will comeback and give this place a second try hoping I will truly understand the joint better."}
{"text":"It's well-established here and across Yelp that Toronto is blessed with a fantastically multicultural dining scene. Adventurous foodies like myself routinely point this out, especially before we launch into a critical review of the latest ethnic hot spot. 

I can think of three reasons for this behaviour. First, it's the culinary equivalent of saying \"some of my best friends are...\", as a means of avoiding accountability for an insensitive comment. Second, it allows for the expression of personal preferences in the face of cultural norms. I may prefer my vegetables less crunchy, but it's because I was raised that way. Third, it insulates us from critiques of our criticism; food can be delicious, but I just don't 'get' it. I wouldn't know good tripe from bad, since it all smells like feet to me. 

This brings me to El Trompo; a small, bloodstained joint in Kensington Market, whose authenticity is heartily debated on these pages and elsewhere. 

I will admit that I don't always get 'authentic' Mexican food. I enjoy complex flavours, but have tried enough 'real' black mole to know that it just tastes muddy to me. I remember family dinners at the long-departed Chi-Chis fondly, although I feel the same way about Lichee Garden, and my tastes have surely developed since then. 

Authentic or not, El Trompo is nothing like Chi-Chis. It's a long, narrow room, with walls sponge-painted adobe red. This is the most disconcerting aspect of the place. If you've ever read or watched \"Dexter\" you half-expect Harry Morgan to come wading to your table in the middle of the blood-spattered space, to collect you and train you in the fine art of vigilante vivisection. 

In summer it's a sweatbox, driving customers to an equally sweltering front patio, where they can gorge on tacos while people-watching. And gorge you will, while hipsters around you flock to the Blue Banana and funny upscale kitchen store nearby.


Breakfast is a blast. Chorizo scrambled with eggs is a bit dry, but perks up nicely with the addition of the aforementioned green salsa. Sided with beans and tortillas, it's a substantial brekkie. Mexican coffee is advertised as augmented with spices, but comes to my table as a watery brew. My dining companion figures out the best breakfast option: tacos and beer; a Tecate tallboy or two, limes jammed rudely down their throats. The weekend also brings the option of house-made pozole soup; a thin broth loaded with hominy and shredded pork, sided with obscene amounts of veg, lime and crispy tortillas. It's good, but unnecessary, as is the black bean soup that can be combined with a set of five perfect tacos. If you're really hungry, better to order sublimely limey fresh pico de gallo and/or guacamole. They come with fresh tortilla chips, but pace yourself so you have extra dip with which to stuff your taco (and no, that's not a euphemism), 

And here we get to the glory that is El Trompo. Reading through this thread, I find people debating the authenticity of the joint, but how can one argue with the piquant perfection of the chicken tinga, or the masterpiece that is the El Pastor, all roast-pork goodness with the occasional acid sweet hit of pineapple. They'll offer cheese to the gringos, but I happily refuse in favour of the brightness.  brought on by green salsa. 

So here is my summary of a perfect day at El Trompo: 

breakfast-tacos and beer. 
lunch-tacos and beer; maybe some pico de gallo. 
Dinner-tacos and beer; definitely guacamole. 

If you have room, they also sell churros on weekend. But why waste valuable tacos and beer space?"}
{"text":"For the restaurant located in Kensington market I had high expectations. It was by far the worst tacos I've ever had. No flavour just the meat and undone tortillas. They served the other person with me first and I still waited another 15 mins for my food. They also forgot to bring the tortillas that came with the order. We instantly had this nauseous feeling and had to go get something sweet after to get rid of the bad taste in our mouth."}
{"text":"Best Tacos El pastor i have ever eaten. Great price and location as well."}
{"text":"A good deal on tacos and the food came out really quickly. The tacos were tasty and satisfied my taco crave, but nothing too special to rave about."}
{"text":"Walked in here on a Saturday evening for dinner. Though their patio was very busy a waitress came outside to seat us immediately. 
We ordered their al pastor special with 8 tortillas and their tamales special that day. The waitress gave us good suggestions and explanations when we asked about the food and drinks. 
The al pastor and tortillas came out to be a lot bigger than I thought which was good since I was sharing it with my boyfriend, it was a very satisfying dish to share. This is the first time I've tried tamales but I thought they tasted really good and smelled amazing! 
This place is also very reasonably priced with the tamales coming out to 3$ a piece and the shared dish at 12$ 
Would definitely return here to try the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"I love this little taco place in Kensington Market. It's rather nondescript and doesn't have that busy, trendy feel to it. It's very family oriented and the focus is on the food. I had a taco platter and it was pretty satisfying. The staff here are attentive and quick. It probably gets crowded in here at times, so try to come when the traffic is lighter. There is definitely a lot more on the menu I want to try. El Trompo is a very solid choice for a Mexican meal."}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: Tasty tacos (but a bit $$$), nice (but small) patio, and friendly staff!

Cost:
-$10-15 per item, which is a bit more than I expected.

Atmosphere/Decor:
-Right on Augusta where the patio gives you the perfect vantage point to people-watch the folks in Kensington Market.
-Inside is a bit more claustrophobic, but for some reason, I really dig the kitschy plastic red and white checkered table clothes.

Ordered:
-Haven't eaten a lot of Mexican food so I can't say how authentic it is, but a lot of the other reviewers seem to think it is!

1. Al Pastor Tacos: Nice chunks of beef mixed in salsa and pineapple cubes and served on five soft silver-dollar sized tacos.  I wish I knew about asking for their spicy salsa sauce.  I also wish the serving sizes were larger.

2. Tinga Tacos: Spicy (?pureed) chicken that wasn't all that spicy - again, nothing some spicy salsa can't fix!

-For the future: Need to try their margaritas, fajitas, and quesadillas.

Service:
-Friendly staff and fast service!"}
{"text":"The taco are really really tiny and sort of bland. The so called \"spicy\" Tinga Chicken hardly had any taste. To be fair, the tortillas were very soft and seemed quite fresh. The Bistec or grilled beef tacos were slightly better but still lacked the seasoning and flavour you would expect from an authentic Mexican restaurant. I should have tried the Al Pastor or the pork tacos, since it is apparently their specialty. On the other hand, they have a large and exotic drink menu (including Mexican beers) that would really hit the spot on a hot summer day. 

Bottom line: lacking in taste and the portion size will not even come close to pleasing a person with a healthy appetite.    

Verdict: El Trompo fails to impress."}
{"text":"Yeah, they're street tacos alright.

That could basically be my entire review.  There's nothing wrong with El Trompo - it's exceedingly basic food, usually done pretty passably.  But while I understand there's some history here, with El Trompo being Canada's first dedicated taqueria it's... it's just street tacos.  And not brilliant street tacos, either.  This is middle of the road quality by the standards of stuff I'd get out of a truck in a South Bay Los Angeles suburb.

The guac's alright, though the accompanying chips aren't very good.  The salsas and sauces are passable, though the method of distribution's kind of unnerving; if you close your eyes, you can imagine the fingers of other diners that have likely passed through them.  And it kinda sucks that you have to order five of one taco, when what you really want is five different tiny tacos to at least get some variety.

If this is your bag, then head a few steps south to Mexican Salsas, which does largely the same stuff but with more customization, and won't force you to order five tacos at a time."}
{"text":"I think I am ready to give up my search for authentic Mexican food in Toronto... I really wondering if they really exist!! 

El Trompo Taco Bar is one of the better Mexican restaurants I been to in Toronto.. but something is missing... The tacos are good.. small but good...but they did not wow me like the ones I have in Mexico... 

Al Pastor ($9.75) 
- Great for snacks.. I can just down those 5 tacos in record time without leaving any for my yelp friend... but I am nice.... 
- The pork is a little dry and blend... more fresh lime juice might help 

Pozole ($5.99) 
- pork and corn soup.. with garnish 
- really really bland... and the garnish on the side were tasteless too.. 
- chili pepper with zero hotness? 
- I almost want to spoon in all the hot sauces on the table to give it a kick!! 

I have to say El Trompo's food is a toned down versions for the real Mexican food... 

BTW, if you like me find those 2 salsa tasted like water with colours... ask the servers.. they have the REAL salsa reserved for the special someone that knows... just ask... and you will have the real thing!"}
{"text":"Taco options in Toronto have improved significantly since I wrote this review. Among others, Tacos 101 -- probably the best in the city -- La Chilaca (right around the corner from El Trompo), and Campechano are notably better."}
{"text":"We are in here every chance that we get. Hands down the most affordable tacos in Toronto; with pretty fast & efficient service to boot.

Recommendations from the menu:
-Chorizo Tacos
-Bistec Tacos
-Al pastor Tacos
-Pico de Gallo (they could improve on their corn chip selection... but it's nothing to fault them on)
-Horchata
-Jamaica 

Out of my experience they only thing I wouldn't order would be the margaritas, as they are the only artificial tasting option on the menu... Without any of the \"homemade\" taste that this restaurant does so well with.

The atmosphere has a family business feel, especially with all tables being covered in transparent plastic. Not the cleanest looking establishment (especially the bathrooms)... but who's here for the appearance? You are here for good Mexican food. In fact you are here for the best Mexican food deal you can find in Toronto."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in for some tacos after walking 10 miles around the city. The tacos were authentic and served with cilantro and onion. The tinga were good but Al Pastor were great. The guac was tasty and not over-salted. The server was such a sweet girl. We opted for the mango cheesecake for dessert and it was the perfect chaser for the meal."}
{"text":"Went to El Trompo for a quick taco meal in Kensington on a rainy day, so wanted to make sure we went somewhere where we could sit down.

Next time, we'll skip it.

We started with the nachos and an order of guac. The pico on the nachos was delicious and fresh. The guac was fresh, but blad. You can get (or make!) way better guac elsewhere.

The tacos are great value (5 for $10), but are dry and bland. At the recommendation of the waitress, I had the El Pastor tacos. They were dry and flavourless. MIL had the quesadillas, which fell apart at the table, and the chicken apparently had a soy sauce flavour...strange for a mexican place. 

Stick with a beer if you're going to have an adult beverage. The lime margaritas were disgusting...lukewarm and mix from a bottle that had that fake-lime taste. 

Overall, very disappointed. Surprised this place gets such great reviews...."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and it has been excellent every time. This weekend I went with a group of 5 friends. Its a tiny place, and almost always busy. We were seated right away by our very nice server. The service was extremely fast, and food was fresh and authentic. We got the guacamole to start, and it is the best guacamole in town. If you want authentic Mexican food, this is definitely the place to go. We weren't impressed by their churros, but the rest of the meal was absolutely delicious. The place definitely had a homey atmosphere-very warm and inviting."}
{"text":"It's actually kind of crazy that I'd never tried El Trompo until now. I walk through Kensington all the time and I love Mexican food, so you'd think it'd be a regular haunt for me.

We arrived around lunchtime on a weekday and the patio was pretty much full, though we were able to secure a pretty sweet table next to the street.

A quick perusal of the menu you led me to a perfect option: the El Trompo Combo (\"our traditional bean soup prepared with bacon, mexican sausage, onions, and roma tomatoes, and one order of tacos of your choice.\") I decided to go with the Al Pastor tacos (\"pork meat marinated in the traditional sauce; served on corn tortillas with pineapple, coriander, and onion.\")

After a short wait, the soup and tacos arrived simultaneously, which was honestly a little irritating. Anyway, I dug in.

The soup is okay. Though the menu lists bacon and mexican sausage among the ingredients, I really only tasted the beans. It's not a problem necessarily - it's a hot, comforting soup - but I suppose I was expecting a more robust flavor.

And that was exactly the problem I had with the tacos, too. They're fine; the meat is well prepared and tender, while the accompanying pineapple, coriander, and onion proves an ideal complement. But the problem is there's really not much flavor here. In fact, the strongest taste is the corn tortillas, so it's really not an ideal situation.

Perhaps I've been spoiled by superior tacos joints like La Carnita and Grand Electric, and maybe this is what authentic Mexican tacos taste like, but I just can't foresee an occasion where I would ever return to El Trompo."}
{"text":"We were wandering through Kensington Market discussing where to go for lunch, when a lovely lady walking behind us recommended this place. She said that her and her husband frequent El Trompo and they love it.
Based on her strong recommendation, we made a beeline for this place.
Being a warm spring day, we opted to sit out on the patio and people watch. Very interesting to see the eclectic crowd that wanders the streets of Kensington. 
We started with guacamole and chips. I'm not a huge fan of guacamole, so I usually don't have any, but one person stated that it was fantastic, so I had to try it. I will admit, it was fairly good. The corn chips were a bit of a disappointment and tasted store bought, which is the reason for the loss of 1 star. 
We all ordered tacos.....2 ppl ordered the Al Pastor, 1 ordered the chicken and I ordered the spicy chicken. We all loved our tacos, with one person exclaiming that hers was the best she's ever had. They were light, flavourful and the perfect amount for lunch.
We ordered a pitcher of the Jamaican Iced Tea to wash it down. It was excellent.
Lunch for 4, with the iced tea, came to around $62 with tax."}
{"text":"I've been coming to El Trompo for a few years now. I used to come here before I even moved to Toronto when my parents and I came to visit my sister. The food is excellent and probably the closest Toronto will see to authentic mexican. Also their patio is the perfect place to be on a sunny day!

Their pico de gallo is fresh and delicious, as is their guacamole. I've had the mixed plate of tacos and the fajitas a few times and never been disappointed! Also their mango margarita is pretty potent (but who's complaining?) and tasty. Friendly service and an kitchen you can see into top it all off!"}
{"text":"We tried martine 
Starboard martine: didn't taste anything like Strawberry 
Lemon martine : was good and refreshing 
Mango martine: very sweet 

Fish taco:  not that great it was same price as 7 lives taco but was not as good"}
{"text":"My experience here wasn't so good. I would have given this food a 1-10. Or less if I could. The only reason I think it deserves one star is because the service was good. I went here because of the amazing reviews it got and was extremely disappointed. Do not go here"}
{"text":"Too expensive for tiny tacos.

PRO:

1. Very friendly servers.
2. Nice patio, with indoor seatings available as well.

CON:

1. Small size: the 5 tacos are 5 cm in diameter. You will not be full.
2. For the meagre amount, you pay $12 after tax, plus tips. 
3. The signature dish, Al Pastor, is quite dry. 
4. No free nachos as an appetizer.

My friends all paid around $20 because one also ordered a cactus salad, and another ordered the margarita. 

Since I wasn't full, I went to Burrito Boyz and got a filling bean burrito for only $5.50 after tax..."}
{"text":"A hostelmate and I went to this place for some tacos.  I had the Al Pastor tacos and I have to say that they were delicious. I was definitely not used to have pineapple in my Al Pastor tacos, but it was still very good regardless. The food fills you up and doesn't break the wallet."}
{"text":"Love this place, service is quick and polite and the food is  authentic.  It reminded me of the food we had and loved in Mexico 
We did not leave hungry and will return the next time our travels take us into the market"}
{"text":"Mexican't? No no. This place is surely a Mexican! 

Tonight I had a lovely early dinner on Trompo's sunny patio. This dirty little joint on Augusta is always ripe for people watching and is perfectly located amidst the hustle and bustle of Kensington's finest shops. I, like most people who did their undergrad/college days in Toronto, have a Kensington shaped tattoo on my heart. $15 gets you lunch, a beer and produce for a week. Seriously, who wouldn't have a heart-on for that?! 

Back to Tromps. We started with the guac, which was ok, very smooth and simple. Then my lovely supper companion (What up Boss Lady Crystal H!) shared two taco plates (each comes with 5 small tacos). We had the pork, which has some refreshing pineapple in tossed in, and the beef with cheese. The beef was best. In my opinion, it always is. But hey, I'm a beefy lady. 

This place makes me happy, and I think is among the most authentic Mexican food in Toronto. 

PEPPER POINTS: For their Margaritas which I've glug-a-lugged on previous visits. One tequila, two tequila, three tequila, MORE."}
{"text":"Awesome little Mexican place in Kensington Market. Super fast service, strong margeritas, creamy guac. Perfect place for a quick afternoon lunch."}
{"text":"Love this place. Amazing guac. Delicious and inexpensive tacos. Super simple but wonderfully spiced and flavorful.  I will come back again and again.
Also the staff is wonderful, the woman I assume is the owner is a HUGE sweetheart and is always so kind and welcoming when I go."}
{"text":"A huge fan of this place because of the variety available, the portion size, friendliness, and the deliciousness of the food.  They have a great patio in the summer and is one of a few places in the city where I will order horchata."}
{"text":"5 tacos for $10.00 I ordered the pork tacos, in which the pork was dry and very chewy. The pico de gallo was very good:) the Lemon Margarita was amazing; other than that their tacos were very disappointing, my wife didn't like her chicken tacos, and the fish taco was ok. It is located in Kensington Market with lots of Mexican restaurants, I tried this because of the great reviews."}
