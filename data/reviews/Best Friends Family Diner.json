{"text":"This place looked dreary at first; then I realized it wasn't dingy, just brown-painted wall over wood wainscoating with brown carpet and dim lighting.  There were actually some attractive decorations on the wall. It had an fashioned lunch counter with white tile on the wall behind the counter, and some soda cases piled up by the counter. We all had haddock sandwich platters.  The fish was OK, probably frozen pre-breaded pieces, deep fried, a bit greasy but OK, on a very nicely toasted bun.  The onion rings were unexceptional.  My son's french fries looked fresh cut -- I wish I'd gotten them instead of the onion rings.  The ladies restroom was dingy-looking but relatively clean; it also served as a storage area for vacuum cleaners and assorted cleaning supplies.  All in all, a decent experience for a quick lunch, and the service was pretty good for how busy they were."}
{"text":"P-O-U-T-I-N-E     M-O-T-H-E-R      F-U-*-*-E-R!!!  So, I've been in the area for about 9 months, and I keep moaning on and on about how I have to drive over the border and put up with the snoots at the gate JUST so i can get real poutine with freaking curds.  And then, suddenly, a voice from above (actually it was a co-worker) said \"um, why don't you just go to Rouses Point?\"  I feel like a dumb ass now. There are TWO establishments within a mile of each other that serve the gastronomic bliss of 'tine.  I've been here a few times, for the aforementioned MFP, a sandwich and some breakfasty options.  So..not only do they serve my last meal on earth, they're super freaking nice. I mean. wicked crazy nice. I went in there for breakfast the other day, and they acted like they'd known me forever....and I'm a freaking outsider from Maine. The ladies who work this joint are seriously down to earth, even at 7 in the morning when they're stuck behind the counter.  In addition to this....last time I was there a pie had the unfortunate experience of getting a bit smooched in the fridge. Guess who got a free coconut cream slice to go with her breakfast. Yeah, this kid,   Menu is straight up comfort food, and the ambiance is much the same. Sure, it looks a  bit worn on the inside...but who needs all the fluff when you can get what you really came for in the first place. Good job, best friends."}
{"text":"Not much to say here, basic diner food, nothing spectacular. Breakfast, lunch, dinner all fine as long as you aren't expecting gourmet. Wait staff is efficient, mostly friendly (seem to treat regulars very well though): just don't sit at the counter or you'll listen to them complain and read the paper together. Not necessarily unclean, but dated, well-worn decor and furnishings give it a bit of an icky vibe. But some people seem to love the place- I just don't see it!"}
{"text":"Love this gem that is just a stone's throw (literally) from the US/Canadian border. We had happened upon Best Friends when we crossed over in 2013 after a trip to Quebec City. We then decided to go back when we were in the area this past July. Both times the food was fantastic and priced more than fairly. My wife had \"the best grilled cheese\" she ever had and I the pancakes with hash on the side. All excellent. On our most recent visit, we were leaving the area and though we were southbound, we headed north and then west to revisit Best Friends first. This was on a Sunday and it was PACKED.. bikers, campers, RVs and the local church crowd all filling in. There was one table open and a waitress saw us standing by the door and she got us seated right away and had coffee in our cups immediately. Can't ask for more than that. If you are in the area, stop by. You will love it. Plus they hand cut their fries. There is nothing like a mom and pop shop nowadays."}
{"text":"This place is classic diner. Good food, good staff, nice customers. Pretty good Michigans, just need to ask for home fries on the griddle not deep fried.   But the poutine? WOOOOOHOO  Located at the Vermont bridge, below the Canadian border."}
{"text":"We were driving through and wanted a local, homey place to stop. Best Friends was the perfect place for that. The menu was varied and the place was busy - always a good sign.   The server was very sweet and helpful. I ordered a burger with hand cut fries and Cole slaw. Best Cole slaw I've had in a long time. The burger was great! A real hand formed patty. Flavorful. Simple with lettuce, tomato and onion. Exactly what I wanted and so good.   My husband had the fried shrimp meal. Came with fries, a second side and soup or salad. He chose baked potato soup which was a meal on its own. Great flavor and texture. We shared that! He said the shrimp were great and the garlic bread was awesome.   Desserts looked good and were homemade but we were too full. Next time!"}
{"text":"More like 3 1/2 stars. There were not many places to eat on US route 2 and we were delighted to find this place. It was recommended by a local. The place was comfortable and the service was good. We had some peach pie with ice cream, which was excellent, and a chef salad which was tasty and reasonably priced. Recommended."}
