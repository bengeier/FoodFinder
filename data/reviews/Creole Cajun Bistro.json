{"text":"I went to Creole Cajun Bistro based upon Yelp review. Even though it is quite out of our way , we were rewarded with excellent Cajun food. I am from South Louisiana and grew up with the crawfish étouffée, red beans and rice (my personnel downfall in eating too much of a great thing), an oyster poboy and okra file gumbo as served in this bistro. I highly recommend it. One should keep in mind that cajun spices often have heat and salt. I am unfortunately now allergic to shrimp ,craba and Crawfish; so make sure if you are also to ask that it not be placed from scratch into the mixture for your choice of cajun delights. A+ for taste."}
{"text":"Sunday at 11:45 we are the only people in the place. Very friendly service.  Ordered fried pickles...huge portion pretty good.  Also ordered fried alligator,  not a fan however kids liked. French bread good. Red beans and rice fantastic as well as the jambalaya!"}
{"text":"I can honestly say we had one of our best authentic meals at Creole Cajun Bistro last Saturday. We had the crawfish mac-n-cheese, andouille, chicken, and shrimp etouffee, fried green tomatoes, and hurricanes... This restaurant truly exceeded our expectations.  The food and drinks were delicious and tasted just like the food we had while visiting New Orleans. The live music and ambience was amazing and the service we received was great!  My husband and I will definitely be returning and recommending this place to everyone."}
{"text":"We tried coming here last year in July while visiting the area.  Unfortunately it was on a Tuesday and they were closed.  We ended up moving to area last August and had been planning on making a visit since then.  Well the wife and I got there today right around opening time.  The Crawfish Mac/Cheese,  Fried Alligator and the Wings were amazing.  Drinks weren't watered down like some places.  The Patron Margarita was perfect.  Our food was served promptly.  Great conversation with the staff who were very welcoming and personable.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Jambalaya, catfish and hush puppies were all fantastic! This is the best cajun joint I have found in the valley."}
{"text":"Unique place to eat in Arizona! Interesting menu if you're ready to try something new. Very friendly staff. My son ordered crawfish and the waiter tried to teach him how to eat it. He was still struggling so the actual chef came out and showed him some tips! Very cool! Overall nice experience. It's a bit pricey, no kids menu , no straws, slow service but very good food and nice people"}
{"text":"Our meal was excellent, the service was good. Staff all very friendly. We ate the fried green tomatoes and had etouffe creole and Cajun style. It came with some garlic rounds that were really good. A generous serving of shrimp too. This is a place I'll return to. It's a hidden gem in Chandler."}
{"text":"We were excited to check this place out because it is in our neighborhood.  Unfortunately the food was not very good.  When we asked about vegetarian options for my mom, the waiter went back to talk to the chef and came back with the response of  mac n' cheese and hush puppies.  We dine out a lot and have never come across the lack of creativity with vegetarian options.  Disappointing.  Will not return."}
{"text":"I read about the opening day fiasco. Stopped by last week and the restaurant was closed. Talked to owner and he explained the situation. Today the bistro re-opened. I had the shrimp po-boy and my fiancé had the red beans and rice with andouille sausage. The shrimp was seasoned well. A extra healthy serving. The beans and rice could have used more sauce, or less rice. However, the dish was delicious.   I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Pretty satisfied with the experience. It is a little tucked away, but they've been around for a couple of years so the location must not be a hindrance to business. The portions are huge for what you pay. Had the onion strings for an appetizer; although they were actually onion rings instead of strings, the batter was still really good and little spicy, satisfyingly crunchy. The catfish nugget basket and fried shrimp basket were both good, generous portions, well seasoned. The cajun chips were also well seasoned, just wish it was crispier, and it was also a misnomer! Not so much a chip as cottage fries, thick cut and corrugated rather than a thin, crispy chip. The bourbon bread pudding tasted good, but it wasn't served a la mode like the picture on the menu, which is kind of a travesty - gotta have ice cream with that! Service was a little slow, the pacing of the meal was a little off (long-ish wait between each course), but very friendly. Definitely worthy of another visit."}
{"text":"We started lunch today with Boudin Balls and they were delicious! My husband and I split andouille and chicken etoufee and it was freaking amazing! The portion sizes are very generous. Friendly staff and clean restaurant. Recommending to all my friends and family!"}
{"text":"All I know is if you're not eating here you don't know good food, good times, good people, good drinks. Chef Eric and Jody do everything to make what you spend worth it. Boudin balls and okra gumbo delish."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Food is fantastic and the owners are great people. Every time I go I try something new and ask for their advise on what to try next. Have yet to get something I didn't like."}
{"text":"Went in at 4pm on a Saturday and was greeted at the door. Told to sit wherever we like. We had a seat close to the front door. They were not busy, only had one family there ordering dinner. Two wait staff were sitting at the bar as well as a cook. They were all engaged in conversation with the bartender. Not one person brought us a water or menu. No one even bothered looking at us. Waited for 10 minutes and just walked out. No one has the courtesy's to say bye. Can't say it was poor service since there was no service at all."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the Grand Opening event! I had the best Margarita ever!!!! It's  beautifully decorated with a cozy ambiance!  Classy classy classy. The music was off the chain and don't even get me started on the food! The food was excellent, fresh tasting and just like homemade!!!! I plan on going again very soon!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here last night for some take out. It was awesome. Had the hush puppies and jambalaya. Really authentic food. Great flavor. Will definitely be back to eat more."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place and to our surprise they had fresh crawfish. We ordered  fried okra, frog legs, fried green tomatoes (the best!) bistro burger, bayou bucket (1 pound of crawfish, potato, corn, crab and shrimp) it was very good. The portions were generous, music was nice. The only disappointment was the owner. She was there and talked to us because we stopped her to ask a few menu questions and when she came back around she didn't ask us how anything was. For being a new place and in a horrible hidden location I would think she would at least smile and ask if we liked the gobs of food we ordered. A little attention to customers goes a long way!!"}
{"text":"Repeat customer here! Yes sometimes you have to wait but then we just order more drinks, the food is worth it! My daughter says there have the best fried pickles, my husband loves the hot wings, I'm always at a toss up between the etouffee or grits, my husband likes the jambalaya."}
{"text":"This is a cute little restaurant tucked away in a corner.  nice atmosphere, friendly staff who greeted us right away.  We had the fried green tomatoes, fried alligator, and crawfish etouffee.   YUM!  everything came out piping hot, clearly freshly made.  the wait for the food was a bit long, but well worth it.  kind of pricey, but not overpriced.  definitely going back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Sadly I was not very impressed by anything at this place. Meals were very bland and not much flavor. There didn't seem to be much effort made by the restaurant to go above and beyond to provide a great dining experience. The water that my date received tasted like tap water and the lemonade that I ordered tasted like lemon flavored tap water. The catfish nuggets that I had were terrible. There was too much batter and not enough flavor. My date had to add pepper to her craw fish Mac n cheese as there was not enough seasoning. It literally tasted like three cheese hamburger helper with crawfish added in. The one positive were the Patron Margaritas that we had. Will not return."}
{"text":"The one positive thing that provides one star is Gabe the server. Friendly and knowledgeable.  Now for the reasons you should never go here:  1. It literally took over 2 hours to receive ANY food. Appetizer included. This was not a fluke incident. Our neighboring 3 tables all received the same treatment. I suppose it's a good way to fill up on beer (if I actually drank).  2. You may get in a fist fight. One of those 3 neighboring tables had a gentleman that finally asked for a manager after 90 minutes of trying to hush his hungry grand-kids. He was tactful but direct in how he spoke with the owners wife. She kept cutting him off and repeating \"We're doing the best we can. If you don't like it then you can leave.\" When she finally left to go to the kitchen her husband (owner) rushed out and the first thing he said to the grandfather was \"You have a problem with my wife?\" The customer never stood up, but the owner had every intention of defending his wife's honor.  3. 5 minutes after this fiasco the food came. The hush puppies were cold. The crawfish was mushy and black. The shrimp was never properly prepared. The crab was compete mush. My daughter had hot wings and didn't even care for those.  4. No apologies were ever given except by Gabe, which was never his fault to begin with. I asked to speak to the manager and had to be tactful or risk of having the owner run out at me as well. The most I was comped was a 15% discount. Whole thing cost me $53 for food that was inedible. My wife went home and ate a bowl of cereal.  I tipped Gabe $20 and told him \"Good luck\".  Maybe it's a sister company of Amy's Baking Company?  ***Regarding Owners comment*** I arrived at 5:50pm. I made an order at 6:00pm. Whether you misplaced my order until 6:55 or simply didn't care is on you. We did NOT receive food within 35 minutes. The server apologized to me several times for how long it was taking. Your wife finally came to me after 90 minutes asking if there was anything she could do. I asked her if we could at least get the sides. Her response: \"I'll see what I can do.\"  20 minutes later the grandfather (yes, grandfather) had spoke to your wife about the wait. That same person who you quote \"had too much to drink\" had a very coherent conversation with my family outside after that garbage experience. He NEVER yelled or pointed a finger \"in her face\". How could he even get that close when he was sitting down on the other side of the table when your wife was standing while talking to him.  I find it interesting how you say we finished our meal. The only misconception I can assume you may have about this was how the plate looked after we tried to find a DECENT piece of meat anywhere on the plate. I showed your server. I showed your wife. We finished the fries, okra, and hush puppies because after 2 hours we were extremely hungry. Kudos to you for pointing out a positive in the whole experience when your wife completed a special request and brought out ranch for my daughters fries.  If you can't handle criticism, you'll fail. If you can't handle your temper because you have a dramatic wife, you will be sued and fail.  I rarely post yelps unless I am very satisfied or EXTREMELY dissatisfied. Your comment with all the fabricated lies encouraged me to post yet again.  Step it up or get out of Chandler.  \"And as far as any man raising he voice to my wife we will have a problem,  period.\" -A response from Eric R. (restaurant owner) concerning this incident."}
{"text":"Such a chill place.  Nice music, small, quaint, bar, and friendly service.  I ordered the shrimp etoufee over catfish.  When the plate arrived I thought I'd be eating it all.  Nope, I actually got way more than I expected.  Be aware that you will get healthy portions.  I got a ton of shrimp and what looked like an layer of catfish covering the plate.  As far as taste goes they certainly hit a home run with the Creole sauce.  The food here tastes like a chef created it rather than just a cook.  I highly recommend you here.  You'll enjoy it just as much as I did."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place for a while, excited to try the jambalaya.  After placing our order we watched two other tables that ordered after us get their food before us.  After waiting 50 minutes we just about had enough and called our waiter over to ask for the tab for our drinks but he said our food was on it's way out.  He brought out only one of the plates while I waited still for my plate.  I was so disappointed with the jambalaya, I pretty much just picked at it and left it.  My husband had a chicken sandwich that he didn't enjoy either, we brought it home for the dog. The food is pricey but if it was good I wouldn't of minded so much.   Needless to say we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Put in yelp24 order, went in to pick up 30 min later and they stated they \"never got order\"....more like they never checked it. After they realized this, they made no effort to speed up order or even offer me a water while I waited another 30 min for food. Once I got food, catfish in basket tasted like burnt grease. Not good quality nor customer service.  In regards to reply of my review: order was placed Sunday night. Regarding yelp24, I get it technology does fail, but customer service doesn't.  Poor service to someone who had to re-put in 60$ order and not once did anyone even offer water much less acknowledge the mess up as I Sat at bar and waited patiently for food."}
{"text":"This is the first time these people opened their restaurant and it was absolutely packed we really enjoyed the food it was absolutely delicious. We did have a wait time but their POS systems  crashed they weren't getting orders and its really not their fault. people give these new owners chance they have very good food.  the shrimp and oyster poor boys absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. We were told that since we had no reservations we wouldn't be served.   However, if we wanted to sit at the bar and order drinks, that would be fine.  We asked if we could order food and sit at the bar, and we're told NO.  There was another couple eating at the bar at that time, but again we were told that would not be an option. We asked if we could order something to go, and the hostess again told us NO.  So we leave and decide to go to Baby Kay ' s Creole Kitchen.   AWESOME!  We arrived and were warmly greeted, and asked if preferred bar or table?  Sat down and we're treated to a little live music (old dude on a guitar...88 years old! And still getting it done!), and the absolute best seafood gumbo ever!  Complete cajun and creole menu!"}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time last night and it was amazing. I've been to New Orleans a few times and the barbecue shrimp was one of the best I had. the taste is pretty close to Deanies in New Orleans. The hush puppies were perfect. I've been waiting for inauthentic Creole restaurant in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Beignets and fried pickles!! Need I say more!? I've been looking for beignets in the valley for a couple of years and to my everlasting joy, they are on the dessert menu here!  Love this place, and even though it's about an hour drive from where I live, it's always worth the trip!  Looking for an authentic food experience? Look no more!!"}
{"text":"I am giving this place 3 stars because the food wasn't terrible. There were some items, such as the Cajun chips and fried green tomatoes that were good. However I ordered the sausage po'boy and it was really just a hamburger that didn't taste good. I took 2 bites and asked them to take it back. Instead of asking if I wanted anything else she argued with me about how I didn't like it. Needless to say I paid for a hamburger that I didn't eat. I have had better southern food that comes with the southern hospitality that the south is known for. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews, I took my Cajun mother here for her birthday. We had a great experience. No fights, no drunks, our orders came out in a timely fashion and perfect. Everything that we tried was excellent. The place was clean and had a relaxed atmosphere. Ginger beer cocktails too! We routinely track down the new Cajun restaurants in town and we are impressed. I'll be back and will be bringing friends and family.  Place is hidden so you do have to hunt for it. If i can get them to add Bayou brand rum to the bar I would be happier than a crawfish in a rice field."}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving this 2 stars and not 1 is because the food was good. However, it is highly overpriced for what it is and the service is horrible. I did not care for the atmosphere of the place, considering the prices they charge, it is more of an eatery than a nice restaurant.  I went there with a family for a private event for which they had a limited menu. We got there early before it was filled and asked if it would be possible to order from the regular menu since my husband was on a strict diet and my kids did not want the poboy sandwiches. The first person said it would not be a problem and that they could grill either fish or chicken for him instead of deep-frying it. When our actual waitress came, she said that that was not possible, although she did order chicken tenders for kids.  My husband ordered carbonated water to drink and then asked for a refill. After we got the bill, he was charged for the water $2.20 each time (even the refill)! This was truly an insult--charging for water and then charging to refill it on top! Needless to say, we are not stepping foot in that place ever again."}
{"text":"Simply MARVELOUS . First time me and my family had the pleasure of eating at this establishment and all I have to say is THANK YOU. Without a doubt the best Cajun food I've had in the state of Arizona hand's down. The food was seasoned and made with so much love you can taste it in every bite. The atmosphere was perfect, service was exceptional, and the beignets were phenomenal. I look forward to bringing my family here for years to come. Thank you Jordynn for you great service and tell the Chef I said to keep up the outstanding work. Look forward to coming back and eating more of the freshest seafood this side of of the valley."}
{"text":"Friendly but misses the mark badly.   In the restaurant business you can tell a lot about the big things by how they do the little things. For me the little thing was a bowl of collards. Pretty standard fare in a southern inspired restaurant. Collards should be tasty, smoky, maybe a bit of meat in them, but most of all they should have some sort of flavor. Portion size was nice, but the dish was mainly pot liquor and the greens were an afterthought. Neither vinegar nor hot sauce could save these.   I had with my greens, crawfish étouffée. Their étouffée is tomato based which makes it more creole as opposed to cream based which makes it Cajun. It's sweet when I hoped for savory. No side dish was offered. Succinctly put it tasted like jarred spaghetti sauce with cayenne. Do not just make it hot, give it some depth. Add some cream and butter. To be fair the sign says Creole/Cajun. But I find it lacking on the Cajun side. Blacken something.   Service was nice but sporadic. I dined alone. Five minutes for a drink when only 12 are in the place is slow. Single diners are easy to turn faster. My food came out in about 20 minutes. A bit slow but ok. I watched a table of six get their meals individually and spread out over time. One would be finishing and then someone else's dinner would show up. Strange.  I think maybe the chef could take a trip to Baby Kay's in Mesa or Lolo's in Gilbert and learn a couple of tricks. I would like very much for this place to make it. Frankly I just don't see it happening."}
{"text":"It's quite a trip from where I live but always worth it.  A couple weeks ago we took a couple who had never had Cajun food and they loved it. Actually, we're going again tonight. Looking forward to  it!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I have eaten at the bistro several times and have never been dissapointed with the food, although I have taken issue with the wait time on occasion.  Had dinner there last night and the food was very good, as was expected. I had the catfish nugget basket which was delish. The fish was fried in a well seasoned batter which was crispy but not too heavy, and the  fish remained moist, tender and we'll done. My  friend had the fried chicken dinner and a side of collard greens. Both were excellent and the chicken was a very generous portion. We arrived just in time for happy hour, so we were able to enjoy 2 well-mixed margaritas  before our dinner came and the wait was reasonable. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was welcoming. A real plus was the great bluesy jazz background music. Neither of us had room for dessert,  but there's always next time!"}
{"text":"Food is Amazing!! Service fabulous and the atmosphere jazzy!!  You really need to try this place if you like Cajun!"}
{"text":"Super chill vibe as it should be!! The crawfish Mac and cheese was amazing.  Got a side of sausage with it and it was heaven!  I couldn't even finish it, nice heaping portion.  Will be back soon to get my grub back on!!!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic Cajun Cooking, this is the place! They have the best variety of New Orleans food in the valley of the Sun. I recommend the shrimp & grits or the Cajun MacNCheese. #cajunfooddoneright"}
{"text":"I have to say that despite all the negative comments that have been wrongfully imposed on this lonely location, I've experienced an amazing, zestfully vibrant, breath of fresh air. As soon as I walked in the door I was greeted by the bartender and as I took a place to seat at the bar, low and behold, little did I know, the owner of the place also welcomed me into his establishment. Ordering as a demanding ex-bartender would, service was on point left and right. I ordered the catfish po boy along with a bowl of okra and some fries. Waited maybe 15 min or so for the food to come out and wow, the okra absolutely blew me out of the water. The Po Boy Catfish sandwich was huge and had the most catfish that I have ever seen on the sandwich, ever. I would have to say from an ex-bartender stand point that this place has the making of a great location with phenomenal food and I would call anyone an idiot for not at least trying the location for themselves to experience this diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"Loved everything I've had there. Best Cajun I've had in a long time. Not a great location (not very visible from the road) so it's important to get the word out about how good this place is"}
{"text":"Great food! Happy fun loving atmosphere! Love a couple of the regulars feels like family. Shrimp and grits great, boodain balls (can't spell it) delicious! Étouffée delicious this week I had the chicken wings delicious,  gumbo great I guess I'm just saying stop by meet chef Eric and Jodie wonderful givers. This is a wonderful place for date night. Beside that the cocktails are wonderful."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a nice evening dinner at neighborhood Cajun restaurant. Service was on point and the owners were touching tables checking on the other guests.  Husband and I will be back for sure. Time to add a new place to the rotation"}
{"text":"Came in for the beer ( I Like Abita) stayed for the food.  Went for the shrimp po boy and the taste of the shrimp (yes gulf shrimp real gulf shrimp) blew me away felt like I was in New Orleans.  Portions are huge.  Later found out all recipes were Eric's grandmothers.  I know were to go to get my Cajun on."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise! Our first trip to the CCB a few weeks ago was well worth it.  I think we've found our nearby creole/cajun joint! I had the Andouille Sausage Étouffée over catfish (and rice).  M-m-m-m! Smack, smack!  Just spicy enough without making me break out into a mean sweat.    My Lady had the Crawfish Mac & Cheese.  Wow!  Great flavor with plenty of crawfish.  The Whiskey Bread Pudding was the highlight of the meal.  Incredible. Haven't had bread pudding quite like that since The French Quarter.  The service was reasonably responsive and friendly.  I'm looking forward to a second visit soon to see if the greatness is constant enough to bless it as a frequent hangout spot."}
{"text":"Terrible Service!!! I went there on a Saturday night and the place was 1/3 filled.  I was told that it was going to take \"a while\" to get my food, and they were right.  My table of 3 ordered drinks and it took about 15 minutes to receive the drinks.  I ordered a second drink and observed the bartender was too busy tapping a new keg so the cook could get a beer rather than a customer get a drink.  The food was average at best and took at least 40 minutes to get to the table. The fried alligator appetizer was terrible.  The mixed etoufee was slightly better.  The highlight of the night was the beignets.  The wait staff was nice and I certainly don't blame them for problems."}
{"text":"What a delight experience! Our first visit did not disappoint.  I had Okra File Andouille Sausage Gumbo. I ordered a cup, a very generous portion served in a \"cereal\" bowl.  My husband ordered Red Beans, Andouille Sausage and Rice.  Again, a \"cup\" came in a bowel.  The sausage is homemade and was the highlight of both dishes.  Chef Eric invited us to come back again for LIVE JAZZ twice a month on Saturday night.  We will come back and bring friends.  Cindy M"}
{"text":"Went here for fat Tuesday.   Pros:  The fried alligator was very good and the.dipping sauce was even better.  I had 2 draft beers and my girl had the white sangria, both were cold and tasty.  The place is pretty good size and has a nice shaded patio.  The staff was very nice we will definitely come back. Cons:  The service was a little slow but we were understanding due the number of new employees.  If there was one thing the restaurant could do to speed up the process, it would be to get a second register. Also, the bar only seats about 10 people but there are plenty of tables in the place if you want a seat.  Overall a good experience"}
{"text":"WOW!  Fantastic food...we wished we had tried this hidden gem earlier.  We tried the frenched wings, sweet corn fritters, dirty rice, chicken etouffee, red beans & rice and the whiskey bread pudding for dessert.  Everything was amazing but the sweet corn fritters were beyond amazing and the whiskey bread pudding was one of the best desserts we've ever had anywhere.  This little bistro is hard to find behind the CVS and Auto Zone but well worth it!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  It has a great New Orleans vibe to go with the great food.  Very traditional Cajun...fantastic!!!  The staff is very friendly and professional."}
{"text":"This food blew me away.  The hush puppies and corn fritters were outstanding.  I would recommend the jumbo and red beans and rice.  And make sure that you save room for dessert and they have a wide variety of southern treats."}
{"text":"Their catfish was on point! I think it's better than LoLo's and don't get me started with their Mac n cheese... I almost stole my 4 year olds side order...."}
{"text":"This was our second visit. The first time we came in we were wowed by the shrimp etouffee and Mac n cheese. Both were bursting with flavor. Unfortunately, we didn't have room to try the whiskey bread pudding. Last night, we made our second visit to try the dessert. Man, we are glad we did. The whiskey bread pudding is out of this world. We absolutely love this place. The food is hands-down some of the best in the valley. The atmosphere is fantastic. I mean this place actually has personality. It's family owned and operated. We had the privilege of meeting & talking to Eric and his family last night. Could have chatted with them for hours. Great people. So welcoming and down to earth. We're so happy they chose to open this gem near our house because we plan to come back often."}
{"text":"We just moved to the area and wanted to find a good place to eat.  This place was DELICIOUS!!  From the fried green tomatoes, shrimp étouffée, crawfish Mac and Cheese and gumbo.  The BEST part was the Whiskey Bread Pudding...to die for!"}
{"text":"Really fun place with great food! It's much more than the impression you get from the the street since it's hidden in a strip on a not so busy corner.   Great New Orleans vibe. Small so make reservations. Authentic menu. Ettoufe was very good. The fried shrimp was excellent! Good drinks and fun desserts. Beignets!  We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The only thing saving this from being a 0 star waa the dj and the fried green tomatoes. Where do I start, first we were told that  because we didn't have reservations we would have to wait 45 minutes for a table although there's nowhere that indicates this on the website. Nor was it busy when we came in, there were several empty tables yet we still had to wait. Once seated we were greeted by a waitress named \"June\" who seemed nice but seemed overwhelmed as it was a Friday night and the restaurant was getting busy. It took her 40 minutes to bring water back and she forgot to out our appetizer order in. After she took our food order we never saw her again nor did she come and ask us how the food was. Now in to the food, the food was mediocre at best with minimal flavor and the drinks were not good either. The hurricanes were too syrupy and were too sweet and the fried green tomatoes were fried too hard.  The jambalya had little to no shrimp and too much chicken and the sausage tasted uncooked.  The etoufee was not three flavorful either. After driving overt an hour to get this place I am sad that my experience was not up to par and will not be patronizing this restaurant again."}
{"text":"We've been wanting to try this place since their banners first went up and finally decided to have dinner there tonight. I'm so glad we did! My husband thoroughly enjoyed his HUGE plate of jambalaya. My shrimp etoufee' was tasty, but not my favorite. I'll try something else next time we go. The best part for me was the fried corn fritters that I've not been able to find anywhere else in Arizona. They were hot and fresh, and made in-house. Delicious!  One of their servers didn't show up tonight so there was only one woman working the front of the house on a fairly busy night. She did a great job, however, keeping my water glass filled and making sure we had everything. Our food arrived quickly and was piping hot.   We'll be back and next time we'll save room for some bread pudding."}
{"text":"We are here visiting family and came here because we love Cajun food.   We ordered the onion strings, but we were given onion rings because the machine was broken so the cook had to cut the onion by hand.   The onion rings were bland and cooked too hard.   There were 9 of us and most of us ordered catfish.   The catfish was cooked so hard that you could hear the crunch across the restaurant.   It took an hour for us to get our meals, which was a HUGE disappointment.   Will not be returning when we come back to Phoenix.    We will look for a better Cajun restaurant."}
{"text":"This Bistro was awesome!! We had touring musicians in town staying with us and I decided to bring them here for dinner. It was a Saturday night and they had live music, an unexpected treat for sure. The food was over the top and we enjoyed the vibe and New Orleans decor and atmosphere. Our guest's were very impressed with food and they should know. Defiantly will be coming back soon and make this a regular stop for some good home cooked cajun fixins!! The only downside is they have no lunch menu. You pay dinner prices for lunch, which can be pricey. I will not be back for lunch, dinner yes."}
{"text":"I'm from Louisiana but I now live in Arizona. I have tried plenty of restaurants in AZ that claim to serve Louisiana food but they lied. I can finally say after years of searching Creole Cajun Bistro is the ONLY restaurant in AZ that serve authentic great southern Louisiana food! They deserve all five stars!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Wonderful people own this restaurant and very talented I must say! Everything from the appetizers to desert it delicious!!"}
{"text":"Authentic food, nice live music. The wait time for the various courses ordered was unacceptable. In fact, I walked out after waiting 35 minutes for the banana foster. Disappointed, as it was the pic of the bananas foster on yelp that motivated us to try them out."}
{"text":"We went there last night for takeout but waited 45+ minutes for outlet food. No one apologized for the wait. When we got home the food was awesome but the wait left a bad taste..."}
{"text":"Stopped there Saturday around 6:30pm. Stood at the front door for a few min. Before women came over. Place was half full. It was just my wife and I looking for an app before the movies. Waitress said that have 2 larger parties so she could not seat us. I then said we'll just sit at the bar and order. Her next  comment was \"well it be at least 45 min to get food\". Really felt un welcomed , they had absolutely no interest in having us in there restaurant. Not a good way to attract customers , after that we will not go back. Really bad experience, we will take our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"From La and hard to find authentic La food, but here it is and they are from La. Fantastic food. I do not trust a restaurant gumbo, but theirs is really really good. The Etouffee is amazing. Do not leave without having the Pecan pie or the bread pudding. So good to have authentic Louisiana food in the desert. Geaux now!!! #LSU #saints #nolaAZ. You will thank me"}
{"text":"Never dreamed we would find great Cajun food in south Chandler, but we did!  The Creole Cajun Bistro takes you back to the great Louisiana food in the French Quarter. They make a mean Zazerac cocktail too!  My favorite dish is the crawfish etouffee. So good."}
{"text":"Wow, what an experience. The service was absolutely up and above. Our waitress made us feel welcomed. She made sure we had any and all that we needed. Very impressed.   The food and the presentation was very good. We ordered, fried green tomatoes, gator for appetizers. Our entrees and to go order, (2) seafood platers, oyster basket, crawfish étouffée, (2) shrimp poor boys, and a slice of cheesecake, one beer.   Everything morsel was good. I really hope more people will try this hidden diamond in S. E. Chandler. My only issue, is the establishment was not busy, and the Chef was present. I wished he would've come by our table for a intro, and asked how we enjoyed or not the service & food. That's my only negative comment. Which really isn't a negative. It's a suggestion.   Can't wait to return, my Mom Loved the fried catfish."}
{"text":"Wonderful place to eat. Nice ambiance. Great food!  The only negative was the food took a long time to be served but our waiter was attentive and once served everything was very hot, fresh, and delicious. The portions are a great for the price!  Will def go back!"}
{"text":"We are from Southwest Louisiana, and would really like this place to succeed. Shrimp poboy is good and is good value. Shrimp basket is pricey for amount of food. Crawfish etouffee is too tomatoey for our liking. In general service is very slow,  and seasoning off food could stand,  \"kicking it up a notch.\""}
{"text":"We will surely come back. The waitress was super friendly and attentive. The atmosphere is small but adequate and they play killer blues tunes. Everything we tried on the menu was amazing and legit. My inlaws are from Mississippi and they approve."}
{"text":"First off, let me say I'm from southern Louisiana.  We had the fried catfish, a shrimp po-boy and an order of Beignets.  All was pretty good except the Beignets.  The prices are very fair for the portion sizes. The shrimp in the po-boy was breaded with cornmeal. IMO, flour breading is more typical, but I'm sure there are many who use cornmeal in LA. Overall, a very good po-boy with plenty of large shrimp, and I would definitely recommend it. The fried catfish was also done in cornmeal which *is* typical for catfish. The catfish was good and on par with any I've had in LA.  Now for the Beignets... I'm sorry to say these were way off the mark.  Very yeasty tasting and completely hollow on the inside. I've eaten Beignets at Cafe Du Monde probably 50+ times in my life and at Coffee Call probably just as many times. They never taste like yeast and while they do have air pockets on the inside they are never complete hollow like a sopapilla as these were.  Overall, I would recommend this place and will very likely go back for a shrimp poboy and to try some other dishes like the Etouffee, red beans & rice, and Jambalaya. (I'm a little skeptical of the Jambalaya though... not sure what is meant by \"served with steamed rice\". No Jambalaya I've had in Louisiana used steamed rice. The rice is cooked with the meat and trinity in it like paella.  And it should never be soupy -- it's first a foremost a rice dish. It might still taste good though so maybe worth a try.)"}
{"text":"Oh Boy!  Great food- fun atmosphere and good menu selections!  Not sure if you like Cajun? Try the andouille sliders- yum!"}
{"text":"Had the wings, Cajun style dry rub. Omg yummmmmmm! So juicy, so flavorful! I got a side of the cole slaw and it was maybe the best cole slaw I've ever had! Hubs had the crawfish Mac n cheese and he loved it!   We had amazing service and really enjoyed our server, as well as the other staff that was also very attentive, kind and fun to chat with!   This is such a great little spot, and we can't wait to come back! Atmosphere was welcoming and fun, beers were cold, lots of smiles from ALL the staff, clean BATHROOMS (which some might say is very important...........)!   Thank you Creole! Looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"The food is very good.. but it's a little too expensive for what you get. Anywhere that sells a chicken finger basket for $13 makes me think twice. I didn't order it, but just the fact they would charge that much for chicken fingers is scary. I had jambalaya and gumbo, paid a cool $15 each bowl. Came with rice, meat, and two small slices of bread. Baguette sized bread, I asked for some more and was charged for 6 more tiny slices. It wasn't much, but for the price you pay for a meal.. you'd expect more bread to be included. The waitress was very nice, but didn't check on us very often. The gumbo claimed to have crab, which is why I ordered it. I didn't even smell the essence of crab, much less any actual crab inside of it. Overall, very good food. Just pricey."}
{"text":"Great place if you want to immediately be told to wait. Without out a hello or a cordial greeting at all our party of 4 was told to wait 45 minutes. The ironic part is there were plenty of tables open inside and outside. I politely asked for my name to be removed from the waiting list and was told \"Okay fine\" without any eye contact. Hard to pay the electric bill on that kinda of business model. It's a shame...we really wanted a good Cajun place to eat at."}
{"text":"It took 45 minutes for our food to come out. But maybe it's because they actually cook their food to order and it's not pre made frozen crap found at other restaurants? I overheard the waitress say they get all their seafood from Louisiana. Sounds authentic to me!  Holy po boy! We ordered the shrimp and oyster po boy and it was delicious. We also ordered the file' okra gumbo. I don't know where the okra was but it was very tasty! It came out warm though, not hot, like it was sitting for a while. The hush puppies are amazing!   Overall the food is very tasty, kudos to the chef. Just need to work out the kinks such as a 45 minute wait for food. I saw a family get upset and ask to pay for their drinks and leave because of the wait. But I support local family owned businesses, and will return in a few months. Also, they have alligator on their menu. Yum? Looking forward to that next time!"}
{"text":"Good food served slow as hell. And if they don't lower their prices they aren't going to make it. Has potential."}
{"text":"Place was great, live music, food was good, drinks were good, can't complain .  Had the crawfish dish"}
{"text":"One of those days when it all turned out right. Jules the server- perky, looks you in the eye, speaks loud enough to hear her, checks back with you, provided boxes and bag for large portions to take home. Not many there but drinks, apps and food timed perfectly. Frickels are great but huge portion. Red beans with          andouilleou sausage served with dirty rice as requested was excellent with the bowl huge. Chicken Tender basket with \"extra crispy fries\" were great. Very satisfied with service and food will recommend"}
{"text":"After a few months this place is on track and dishing out great classic creole and Cajun dishes from frog legs to gumbo to red beans and rice and etufee.   I stop in at least once a week and I haven't had a bad meal or bad service.  When it's busy things slow down a bit but the food always comes out freshly prepared.  Oh and the collared greens are my favorite side."}
{"text":"We wanted to love this place.  Really!  We love Creole food and were so excited to have it so close to our house.  The environment is great.  The music playing made me think of my times in Nola.  We were just wanting to try some appetizers/starters to see if we should come back for a full meal.  We both ordered drinks, \"frenched\" cajun wings, and the Creole Barbecue Shrimp.  The drinks were great.  The wings were tasty but there were not actually \"frenched\" - that term is a technique in preparation where the wing almost looks like a lolli pop.  There were just standard wings in a cajun sauce.  Had it not been labeled \"frenched\" I wouldn't have been let down.  They were super delicious and had great flavor and the breading gave good crunch. But we both felt misled by the wording of the menu item.   And the shrimp.... Now, we have had Nola BBQ Shrimp many of times.  These were completely inedible.  The poop vein was still in place and the shrimp were completely over cooked.  We tried peeling the skin off and it just was so over cooked that the skin took the flesh of the shrimp apart.  It was dry and tasted fishy.  It just wasn't cooked properly.  The presentation was beautiful and we had high expectations just by looks but once we tried our 1st shrimp we couldn't even finish that same bite.  We told the server it was overcooked and not edible - she said it was specific cooking technique - that it was fried and it made it harder to peel.  We just thought it didn't taste right and politely said no thank you.  They did ask if they could re-make the order without the skins.  At that point we just didn't want to try another version so we said no thank you - we were happy with the wings.  We finished up and paid.  Didn't really look at the bill to see if they removed the shrimp from the bill (we each only took one shrimp from the plate to try and we both couldn't finish the bite).  So it wasn't like we ate it all and said we didn't like it.  Once we were packing up to go - we saw it was never removed.  We are not ones to send food back to the kitchen - we just feel mean in doing it.  :(  This i probably the 2nd time we have ever done that.  I am very surprise the restaurant didn't try to make it right with us.  I am not sure but I felt like the owner was at the bar and just didn't care.  Really disappointing.  The server was very nice and well meaning but the shrimp was NOT good.  We would had been willing to try the restaurant again but feel like they didn't value our patronage so we won't be coming back.  Sorry."}
{"text":"As good as it gets this far from New Orleans.  We went at lunch time so there was no wait time.  All the staff were very friendly and pleasant.  My husband ordered shrimp étouffée and I had the jambalaya.  Both were excellent and the servings were so large that we took it home to have another complete meal.  My compliments to the chef.  We will definitely be back again and again.  Excellent."}
{"text":"Will never go back to this place! My family and I sat down and waited for over 20 min with no one to come over with water or anything. The place had 3 tables going so I would have thought that they at least would greet us. When we walked in the lady behind the bar just said sit where ever. Place is close to home so it sucks that we did not get a chance to taste the food. But because of the horrible first impression we wont spend any money there and will make sure that no one in the area does either."}
{"text":"Really good food, and probably the best Sazerac I have ever had. The restaurant is small, and the night we were there they had live jazz music. The shrimp etouffee was really good, although a smallish portion size. The highlight of the meal was definitely the bread pudding, a rich moist pudding with a whiskey sauce. The only miss of the restaurant was the high price point of the appetizers. The appetizer were as much as the entrees."}
{"text":"Sooooooooo glad we found this place!!  My brother in law found an article about this place in the news paper so we decided to try it out.  Oh boy.. found another place to add to our routine places to eat out.    I had the shrimp and grits.... pretty good and the portions were pretty large.  I don't know what happened but i ate the left overs the next day.... man it was amazing!  It was better the next day!  I think the grease and spices had a chance to soak into the grits.... wish I had saved more!  Brother-in-law had a bowl of gumbo.  I tried a bite and it is on par with some of the better versions I've had.  And we took some wings how for my wife to try.  The breading on the wings was great.  Even after 20 minutes streaming in the box/bag they were still pretty crisp.  Can't wait to try these at the store on our next visit.  And i save the best for last..... the beignets!  Mother have mercy on my soul I'm in trouble now that I know how good theirs are.  Stay for a good coffee and these and I promise you will fall in love.  We will be back.... many times for sure!"}
{"text":"Met a friend of mine for lunch.  I had a crawfish po' boy and some cajun chips.  My buddy had the Andoulle Sausage sliders.  Everything was very good, with plenty of food and an original Cajun flavor.  They have a full line up of Cajun fare and I would highly recommend this place!  They have a nice bar area with a great appetizer menu, including frog legs and gator.  Looks like a good little happy hour spot."}
{"text":"This is an awesome place! Great food. Had the shrimp and grits. Just the right amount of spice. The decor was awesome, and music matched the decor.  The owners are great people. Stop in and give it a try you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Very good dessert. Very warm welcome staff is nice. Good is great. Thanks for having us on my birthday. Glad we have Cajun thing a try. Had frog legs pretty good just wish there was more of them. Last time I had them from somewhere else we got like 20 of them. Thanks again"}
{"text":"I have given it two attempts 6 months apart and the service and attitude have not changed. You would think after the owners have read the reviews on google and Yelp they would put some systems in place to fix the way they run this place. The female owner is just outright rude. She seats you without saying a word and if you have an issue she tries to shut you down real quick. She really should just stay in the back or just run things from home since her presence is just plain uncomfortable. Just to give you a little taste of what to expect, the first time I went with my family it was for my birthday. They had only opened 1 month prior to this first visit and let me tell you, I've never experienced anything like this. The owner sat us without one word out of her mouth and just plopped our menus on the table. We ordered appetizers and our meals. They were out of one appetizer so they just decided to double up on the one they had and charged is for both. We sat there drinking our sprites and eating hush puppies for 50 min before I first asked where our food was. The waitress very kindly aplogized for the wait and said they were behind on orders. Another 45 min went by and we started noticing that customers who arrived after us that seemed to know the owner were getting serviced their food right away. At that point I approached the owner to inquire about our food and she said that food comes out in the order they were placed. I told her that I saw at least 2 parties that came in after us get their orders within 30 min of being there and we had been there for nearly 2 hrs. She began to argue with me telling me that there was no way that was happening and said there was nothing she could do. I was there with my two young children who were starving and decided after 2 hours that we would just go home and eat birthday cake for dinner. I informed the owner that we were not going to wait any longer and she handed me a bill for 4 drinks and 2 orders of hush puppies. Unbelievable right? Well, believe it and if you want to experience this 0 star service for yourself, give it a try."}
{"text":"Another excellent meal. Tonight's choices included fried green tomatoes, Cajun wings, crawfish Mac n cheese & hurricanes. The favors were authentic &  exquisitely flavorful. You don't find food like this often, especially in a location like this. It is worth. As usual, it takes a while to get the food to the table, but if that's what it takes to experience this kind of food fare then it's worth it.  I will be back."}
{"text":"In summary 3 stars for now with the potential to get to 4 if they can get their wait staff properly trained.   Went there for dinner. First and foremost, their service is lacking. We got there around 730ish. There were about 2 patrons in the restaurant, pretty empty. It took a long time after we were seated before a waitress showed up. And then it took equally long time for water to show up after the waitress took the drink orders. We ordered crawfish etouffee and fried catfish with hush puppies on the side. First the etouffee. It's ok.... I feel Baby's Kay's etouffee is WAY better. The rice could've used some more cooking as it was chewy and on the hard side. The catfish had a tasty breading and overall was good. The hush puppies are the bomb though. Very tasty and combined with the bacon aioli was pretty awesome. I'll have to go back and try some other stuff, but probably try to hit them on off nights. I just don't see how they can handle a crowd when the waitress couldn't even handle 3 tables in a timely manner. I also want to say the food took a bit of time to come out given the number of customers. It seems the waitress has not had the food as she said she's heard this or that dish is good. Maybe this is common but to me you want your wait staff to have tasted all menu items so they know what they are talking about and can sell with confidence. This place can be pretty good if they can improve on the service side."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere but slow service for a Friday night when there weren't that many other people dining. You could tell that the servers were working very hard. Mac n cheese bits not anything special. Shrimp po boy big but too much bread. Chicken etouffee looked great but really lacked flavor and the chicken tasted like it may have been broiled. As I always say, try for yourself because it may be a different experience."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Owner and Staff were friendly and welcoming. I will definitely come back. Advice Cajun packs a punch.. Thanks E and J."}
{"text":"NO NO NO!!! small portions, forgot our appetizer. My grandsons were crying because of the hour wait for their food. I realize you have only been open to 13 days, but NO EXCUSE for not getting their chicken fingers out in over an hour wait. I will never go back!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Creole Cajun Bistro for lunch today. This restaurant is wonderful!!!!  It's small and a little tucked away but the food is by far some of the best Cajun we've had!! The seafood was fresh and everything was prepared perfectly. The portions are really generous as well!!  The chef came out and chatted with us for a bit, you can tell this is his passion. I absolutely love supporting small and local businesses!!! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"I lived in NOLA for 3 years and have traveled there almost every year for the past 40 years. In my opinion, Creole Cajun Bistro is the best restaurant I've ever been to for authentic Creole and Cajun cuisine. The food here is outstanding. The breadth of their menu and quality of cooking is extraordinary. They have all my favorites from red beans & rice, crawfish etoufee, jambalaya, gumbo, bread pudding, beignets, and coffee with chicory. They cover all the bases beautifully. I can't think of any restaurant in the New Orleans area thats offers and does everything so well. The waitstaff is professional, helpful and couteous. I love Creole Cajun Bistro. It's a true gem."}
{"text":"My husband and I took our three kids here last weekend. Everyone was so nice and friendly. Others on the wait staff even checked on us. The food was very good. We ordered the hush puppies as an appetizer and loved them. My son got a catfish po boy and it was amazing!   My only complaint was our waitress (who was super nice) however, I ordered a cup of red beans and rice for dinner and received the bowl. No big deal! I'll pay the extra $5-6 and let it slide.  My nine year old ordered herself a catfish and fries off the kids menu. It was huge and we commented on it and our waitress laughed. When the bill came we were charged for the dinner catfish vs kids. We asked our waitress and she said our nine year old daughter didn't specify kids.  I feel like it's obvious that my child would order off the kids menu since she was sitting their coloring on their kids menu that the server brought. We will definitely give it another try but be more specific apparently."}
{"text":"assholes. Drove 20 miles to have lunch here but they changed their hours and do not open until 3 pm. Got here at 12.  They claim to be open at 11. Cross this one off the list"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Kind of a hidden gem, but worth seeking out. The owner is a great person, and it's very comfortable inside. It's hidden behind the CVS at Chandler Heights and Gilbert. A taste of the big easy right here in Chandler!"}
{"text":"We ate here last night for my daughter's graduation. She wanted to recreate the crawfish boils we ate while living in Louisiana all the way down to having the food from the boil thrown on newspaper clad tables. The owner and chef couldn't have been more accommodating of our request! The food was absolutely amazing. The crawfish boil was just as we had remembered it from Louisiana -- incredibly flavorful, with a wonderful combination of crawfish, Andouille sausage, potatoes, and corn. The service was top-notch. From the polite, kind young man who got our tables prepared for the boil to be spread over them, to our server who was so attentive and made our visit fun with her enthusiasm, to the chef who went out of his way to fulfill our special request (and cooked it perfectly), to the owner with her easy acceptance of our request when we called a couple of weeks ahead, to her care the night of that everything was as we asked. We couldn't have been happier with our experience. We will be back as we saw many items on the menu that we remember from New Orleans and would love to have again!"}
{"text":"I had the worst experience ever here. Made our order at 11am, told us he'd have it ready by 12:30pm. Nothing at 12:30 called at 12:45 said 10 more minutes. At 1pm, still not done. By 1:10pm we called to just cancel, we were hungry and were going somewhere else. Before we could even get off the phone, the owner/manager came storming through our doors yelling, and making a scene at our facility. And for $100, he gave us fried pickles, eggplants, and green tomatoes. That's it. The picture is what we got. You be the judge! Oh, sorry 10 mins later his son felt bad and brought over some mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Ordered a catfish po boy and it was very good. They do seem to still be struggling as far as running smoothly.Things seemed very chaotic, They had live jazz when I was there, and though I appreciate live jazz very much, it was out of place here. It was so loud that it was impossible to communicate with my guest and the waitress had to scream for us to hear her and vise versa. Hoping they stick to the food and getting the place running smoothly.  It is just not big enough for a live band"}
{"text":"This place is great!!!! I started to give 4 stars because it was a bit pricey but then when I saw the portion size I was like HOLY HEY! Good was great! 1 entree split between my fiancé and I was more than enough but we had to order a side of corn fritters and wings too! The atmosphere is great! Bar is large enough to fit a lot of people and they have outdoor covered seating. Had two large speakers playing great music and the cook came out to talk to us. Was very friendly and welcoming! I hope this place stays open for a while!"}
{"text":"One of my coworkers told me about this place, so my husband and I decided to give it a try on our date night. I usually don't do reviews, but decided to do one for this restaurant. I ordered shrimp and grits, and my husband ordered the creole etouffee with shrimp. After waiting for about 30 minutes for our food, our waitress came over and told me the machine that makes the grits is broken. I was speechless....I told her to just bring my husband his food and I didn't want anything else.       She then came back and said if I waited for 10 more minutes (in addition to the 30 minutes we had already waited), they would make my food. I said the only way I would wait is if it was free. She left again, came back and was about to say they couldn't give it to me for free. I asked for my check, my husband canceled his order, and said we will never come back. This was our first time there, and we said as much to her. Not once did a manager come over to apologize or ask if there is anything that could be done.      We left there and went to Native Grill, where we ordered and got our food within 20 minutes. My husbands order was incorrect, but he ate it any way. Our server acknowledged it and took it off the bill without us saying anything. I said that to say, this is how service should be when dining out."}
{"text":"A delicious taste of home! If you are looking for authentic creole food in Arizona, this is definitely the place to go!  The jambalaya is my favorite! The red beans and rice is amazing"}
{"text":"We had a nice lunch with good service. No waiting and food came to the table in a reasonable amount of time. Tried the gumbo & fried chicken breast po' boy. Big portion sizes. The only thing stopping me from giving five stars was that the remoulade sauce tasted like tarter sauce."}
{"text":"We had lunch there and thought the service was good. I had a shrimp po boy that was huge. The shrimp and sauce were good and would order again. A nice ambience and a place I would like to see be successful . Having grown up in Tex/Louisiana I do know what gumbo should taste like and I always judge Cajun restaurants by the taste and quality of their gumbo. The gumbo was a disappointment . The roux was too thick, no file available, no okra and the taste was not even close to what gumbo should taste like. I would like to rate it higher but for me, a Cajun restaurant must serve a good and \"real\" gumbo. Hopefully it will improve in the future."}
{"text":"Came here today for lunch and was floored by the service and quality of the food.  In AZ we are limited to a few places that have authentic cuisine and the Chef here knows what he is doing in the kitchen.  This place restored my faith in cajun cuisine outside of Louisiana and I am already making plans to come back with additional friends. BTW...the Chef is from Louisiana so do yourself a favor and stop in and try anything on his fine menu. Make sure you leave room for coffee and  beignets, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious. We had the shrimp and grits, the gumbo, and hush puppies. All of it was great. The hush puppy portion was way more than expected. We went on a Friday night and there was a DJ so it was loud in there, but the music was good so we didn't mind that much. There was tons of people so the food must be good to most. Definitely going to be my creole/Cajun go to spot."}
{"text":"Best Cajun/Creole food I've had since Mulate's closed in Breaux Bridge. Fried Green tomatoes, Crawfish Etouffee in a blond roux poured over catfish. Crawfish Mac and Cheese, homemade peach cobbler and the beignets. Et Toi!! Everything clean and the service was great!"}
{"text":"When we were in New Orleans by husband loved the food, me,, not so much.  But last week my co-workers were talking about this place so I thought it would be nice to take him there, must be something on the menu I would like  We walked to the door and the first thing you see is a health department A rating, that is a good start. The place is small and nice.  At the start the service was quick but at the end, we waited quite awhile for her to return with boxes. My husband ordered the jambalaya and the special of the day was pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw on top. The sandwich was very good, fresh bun and very large.  I could only eat half of it. My husband loved his food.  I tasted it, lots of flavor, defiantly not bland, lots of flavor and then about 2 minutes later the back of my throat started to burn.  Not my style.  But he loved it.  He wants to go back"}
{"text":"Tried this unique restaurant once before with great satisfaction. The food was on point and customer service was ok. However, this evening I went in to place a to-go order and the customer service was unfavorable. The woman behind the bar took my order but gave off a vibe that I was bothering her. She stated it would take 1 hour for one order of a chicken tender basket followed with asking if I still wanted to place that order. I said yes as this order was not for myself otherwise I may have passed as this was seemingly a long time for such an order. She said she would give me a call when the order was ready. My order was placed at 6:10pm...7:18pm, no call was received so I went in to check. The order was ready. That same woman shouts out \"I called you!\" I replied that I did not receive a call and her response was \"it went straight to voicemail\". I have a hard time believing this as I received another call within that hour, no problem. I'd like to give this place another go, hoping this was just an \"off\" day. Customer service goes a long way, especially with small business. Creole Cajun Bistro, please take note."}
{"text":"Let me start this review by saying I was born and reared in New Orleans. I grew up eating great seafood and authentic Cajun and Creole food. I think calling this authentic Cajun and Creole food is like calling Olive Garden authentic Italian Food! I had the fried seafood platter. It cost $30.00 and was almost inedible. The seafood is battered in a cornmeal batter. It was not seasoned well and was so hard I thought I was going to break a tooth. My friend had the Jambalaya and it was also tasteless and a very big disappointment. My wife had the Fried Green Tomato Po Boy. She was also very disappointed with her food. The green tomatoes were cut way too thick and were also coated in that hard cornmeal batter. The bread used for the Po Boy was definitely not French bread. It was more like a soft hoagie roll. For dessert we had the beignets which were okay, but definitely not the Cafe Du Monde Beignets that I am accustomed to. We also tried the bread pudding. The bread pudding was tasty but it was honestly such a small portion for the price.  We all thought the decor was cute and definitely had a New Orleans vibe to it. The server was friendly and the playlist was nice and made me reminisce about home. I have been to a Cajun style restaurant in Avondale that has a very similar menu. I am not sure which restaurant opened first but the menus are almost identical. The difference is the Avondale restaurant (Flavors of Louisiana) is much tastier and has a more authentic taste. It is not as expensive as this place is and the food tastes so much better! I know everyone has different taste preferences, but personally I would never go to this restaurant again!"}
{"text":"The food and service were awesome! Olivia (the server) was a breath of fresh air. She was attentive and friendly. I wish all servers were like her. I had the Mac n cheese and tilapia basket and my husband had the jambalaya. Both were really yummy. The only disappointment was that because the portions were generous, we didn't have any room left to try their amazing whiskey bread pudding.   Don't let any negative reviews keep you from trying this place. It is well worth it. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"There's a few times in life when you get to taste food that actually tastes exactly what it's supposed to taste like and the Creole jambalaya is one of those...."}
{"text":"Man! We couldn't get out of there fast enough. We were hoping to find a cajun spot on this side of town. We normally drive to Avondale (Flavors of Louisiana) or Phoenix (Pappadeaux's). Not even better Baby K's.  Some of the worst cajun food we've ever had. We started with the fried alligator & chicken wings. The wings hidden behind the house sauce was ok. The alligator was rubbery, bland & chewy. Bring extra teeth. The alligator pulled away from the breading & was knotty. The sauce it came with was good.  The ettouffie with andouille sausage, chicken and shrimp had body and color but lacked flavor. The chicken tasted as if it was boiled separately and added as an after thought. The catfish is rested on tasted as if it wasn't properly cleaned. It had a muddy flavor. I eat catfish all the time but this is not it. My wife had the catfish po boys. The presentation was amazing. They gave her a lot of food however, it must have been made with the same catfish from my dish. The catfish tasted dirty, muddy, rubbery & had knots also. Not good! They give you a lot of food. Unfortunately its alot of mediocre to bad food.  It wasn't all bad. The greens and the pot liquor it comes in was really good and flavorful. I wish the greens had more body & texture but the flavor was on point. The highlight of the meal was the hurricanes. Whoever made those drinks knew how to make it. Maybe that's the plan. Get you drunk so u don't mind the food. The service was great. Loved Olivia!  So $100 later, we took 75% of the food home to throw away. For us...no need to revisit. Avondale here we come!"}
{"text":"Yesterday's visit 2/26/15 to celebrate my husband's birthday came with no preconceived opinions regarding the opening restaurant's fiasco. We were quickly seated and drink orders were taken. Our server was attentive and knowledgeable regarding the menu. Judging from the food pics I just saw b4 writing this review it seems the menu has been scaled back. We started off ordering the fried alligator app. and at almost $15.00 we received only 8 or 9 alligator nuggets at most. When it was time to order our entrees my husband was excited to order the fried chicken basket until we were informed the dish was more like fried breast chicken tenders, not an individual piece assortment. We were dissapointed and wondered why the Chef wasn't making fried chicken as one would think. My husband ended up ordering the Bayou bucket ($29.95) and if you like spicy you might enjoy this dish, however, he found most of the crawfish to be inedible because they were bad with black flesh! I ordered the catfish basket ($13.95) and received a few catfish tenders much like chicken tenders, not an actual catfish filet like at other establishments which was disappointing. The tenders were overcooked and not light and flaky. The hushpuppies that I ordered with my dish were piping hot and good if you like spicy. The end to our meal was also disappointing because the beignets we were looking forward to weren't available and were told the order hadn't come in. (So I guess they're not making them from scratch). All in all, for more bang for the buck and better value not to mention the kind of fried chicken and catfish I expect, Baby Kay's on Dobson in Mesa will be our go to when we get the hankering for some good Cajun food...."}
{"text":"I saw this place on azcentral and was excited to try it out. What a let down. The negative reviews pretty much sum up our experience. The owners were so unprofessional that it made the environment uncomfortable. Our food took way longer than it should have and our crawfish was inedible. We attempted to talking with management about it but she was confrontational and tried to start an argument with us. We were patient with them since they are a new business; however, the way they behaved is unacceptable. We will definitely not be back."}
{"text":"How do I rate this place with half a star?  There were literally 9 people in this place including my family of four and it took almost 10 minutes to get our drinks.  After 45 minutes of waiting for our food I noticed one couple and another small group of people came in and received their food before us.  Ridiculous!  I paid for our drinks and we left.  I will never return to this place!"}
{"text":"I thought a great New Orleans Style BBQ Shrimp was nonexistent on this side of the nation but I was wrong!!  Everything was delicious and a true Louisiana flavor! The boudin balls, BBQ shrimp, Red Beans and Cajun Crawfish Étouffée took my taste buds back to South Louisiana! And don't let me forget the Strawberry Daiquiri and Hurricane I had were a perfect meal accent and took my back to Bourbon street! Will definitely return and courage friends to visit frequently as well!"}
{"text":"Our first time here... this place is... Phenomenal!  Authentic southern cuisine!  Superb lunch and a cobbler that you must try... if you like Cajun style this hidden gem is worth finding!!!  We'll be returning soon!!!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here and the food was amazing.  The etouffee and shrimp/oyster po boy were prepared just like we hoped. The po boy had double the seafood I see on most po boy sandwiches and the breading was great.  We also tried the fried green tomatoes. They serve them with some Cajun seasoning and a mayo-based dipping sauce that really compliments the flavor.  Loved this place - will be back soon!  One comment is that the inside dining is small, so we will make sure to have reservations next time."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went here on Easter Sunday, and weren't disappointed! I was born and raised in New Orleans, and after traveling and living all over the world, call Gilbert home now. It's nice to find a place that gives me my childhood dishes cooked just the way that they should be. We will definitely be back!!!!!!!!! Laissez les bon temps roulez!!!!  :)"}
{"text":"This is a good place for Cajun seafood but you have to be soooooo patient to eat here.  We got here on a Froday night, while the place was busy but didn't feel it should have been overwhelmed. The service was attentive and we ordered right away with our drinks.  Then the wait, the wait and then some more wait.   The appetizer took exactly 55 minutes before it made its way to our table. Nothing fancy, juts some chicken wings. 55 minutes. The food took another 20 minutes to get to us. From the time we sat down to start eating, it was one hour and 10 minutes. For a restaurant with capacity about 50 people.   While I enjoyed the food, I won't be returning here any time soon!  Tip to owner: the food may be nicely quality controlled, but you HAVE TO figure out a way to run the kitchen more efficiently. No chicken wings should take 50 minutes.  Eric (the owner) responded to my review: I appreciate all the good that are prepared fresh, but you are not the only restaurant that does that. There are other Cajun seafood places around the country that offer delicious food, they did not have their customer wait an hour.  Instead of taking offense on what others and myself have posted, maybe really take a look at your kitchen process. No ill will is provided here and we are giving you constructive feedback on an area of improvement that you can work on, there are few chances to talk directly to your customers. Big business spent million on getting to know their customer. Take the criticisms to heart, review your kitchen practice, improve the turnaround time, and you will have many more return customers."}
{"text":"Girls night bought me here! Food was delicious and the service was great!! I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Meals are always hot, freshly made and bursting with flavor. Beans and Rice is always piping hot and carrying a rich taste.   Chicken is always crispy to order and given in generous portions. In striking a balance to be accommodating to all customers, the Bistro teases patrons with more discerning taste buds towards \"mom's fried chicken.\" Perhaps in the best interest of those raised on \"mom's,\" the Bistro more carefully manages the saltiness of its chicken.  That is made up with the 'home-run out the park' collard greens.  The experience of music, ambience, beverage selection and variety of tastes leaves the patron planning their quick next return."}
{"text":"Food was great but service was terrible.  Took us 1/2 hour get drinks and place order and there were only 2 other tables with people and there were 2 servers. We constantly had to flag them down to get things that should have been automatic. They could have sold 3 more drinks if they would have come by or even have been in sight.    Very disappointing but I would go back as the food was authentic and good but if the service is the same, I'm done."}
{"text":"We got there around 6:30pm on a Saturday night and was told we had to wait 25 minutes to be seated. Not sure why people are complaining about waiting. They let us sit and order drinks during the wait. Pro tip: while you wait, strike up a conversation with your date instead of complaining. The food was a bit spicy which we like and the portions were very large."}
{"text":"As anyone who knows me know you have to earn your stars and they did..had the shrimp Etoufee..and  added catfish and the meal was superb. My friend asked for red hot hot sauce and they had none but the sweet waitress brought back crystal about 2 mins later out came the Senior chef with a home made habanero pepper sauce! . I asked for one also he did not bat an eye the food was fabulous and this was the icing on my cake love them. Clean courteous good food..on a recommendation thats life!!!!"}
{"text":"After driving past this restaurant many times in the last year we decided to give it a shot. When we first walked in we were a bit curious as to why there was only one other couple in here on a Friday night at 530. We sat down a took a look at the menu. I decided on the Bayou bucket and my wife chose the catfish basket with mac and cheese.  The fried catfish came out and while it wasn't horrible it did come with the skin on. The bayou bucket came out in a basket. Blue crab, shrimp, crawfish, potatoes and corn with a side of andouille sausage. Every bit of it was over cooked, the crawfish were undersized and not purged. We had our waitress ask about the crawfish and the chef said they were out of season. For 29.95 a bucket you make sure your food is in season and cooked right. What an utter disappointment. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"1.we were told there was a wait (5 empty tables) we could sit at the bar but could not order for 20 min as the cook was backed up 2. Told the beer was 5.00 but after we finished it was told it was 7.50. We had to pay the difference 3. App was served same time as food  4. Very pricey ..... After all that food was just ok"}
{"text":"We had a desire from some Cajun.  I know a couple of places, but thought I would check Yelp anyway.  Sure enough, spotted this place which is more convenient to our home and had really good ratings.  So here we are!  We ordered the Boudin balls first.  Those were really good, especially with the yellow sauce (they said it was mayo-based, not mustard-based).  My wife wanted seafood so she got the seafood platter.  Basically a large basket of fried seafood and hush puppies.  Simple but pretty good.  The hush puppies were more interesting than others I have had.  It looked like a lot of seafood, but we quickly realized it was piled on top of a large pile of French fries.  But it was still enough.  I had the crawfish etouffee.  It was very nice.  Portion was adequate, flavors were good.  Perhaps a little bit expensive, but not too bad.  Our server was polite and pleasant, but not very attentive or enthusiastic.  She wasn't that busy (there were never more than three other tables occupied while we were there).  Maybe she was having a bad day?  Maybe her dog died?  Don't know.  But she didn't seem to want to be there, and she didn't really go out of her way for us at all.  As I said, perfectly pleasant but really not interested at the same time.  I would be willing to try them again.  We're thinking next time we might try the bucket of crawfish (sold by the pound)."}
{"text":"Best Creole food we've had in a long time.  So glad we found this place.  We'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Their smiles made me feel welcome, their great attitude made me wanna stay, Eric's passion for food made me eat too much & his catfish took me back home & made me literally cry.......I have Never cried over food before in my life! I don't mind sayin this Big Teddy Bear of a Pit Master/Chef/Owner and his whole crew including CJ the Bartender & Eric's Lovely Lady Jodie whom Captains the main floor are not only kind & intelligent but some of the classiest people in AZ. I accidentally found this little gem, but I will be goin back on purpose many times. There is not one bad dish on the menu. EVERYTHING is DELISCIOUS & they don't even mind ya gettin a little messy mowin through a few Lb's of Crawfish......... A+"}
{"text":"This place was ok. My husband & I went with 4 other friends because of the review in Phoenix Mag. The appetizers were good.  The alligator was surprisingly good despite its $16 price tag for 6 sml pcs. The main meals were average. The only dessert worth having was the bread pudding. I realize some of the items on the menu are not typical to this area but I thought their prices were still quite high for shrimp, sausage & chicken that I CAN find locally. This was my 1st Cajun experience and I was not blow away. The wait staff was friendly & pleasant.  The food was timed well.  I was disappointed that the dish I went there for was not available due to seasonality of its ingredients.  The Etouffee I had was good but nothing to write home about.  The Mac & Cheese was oddly incredible of all things! CCB has been open only a few months & I think as they can start financing their growth with other menu options they will do just fine.  Can't say I loved it or hated it.  If someone invited me to go, I would go again but would not make a trip there myself.  $82/ couple seems a little steep for a small dive-ish location....  you decide."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. Hard to find good Cajun food in the valley, really only this place and another that are worth the time. We stopped in last weekend after a family outing. I was referred to them, which is good because the location is a bit hard to find. I have driven past it dozens of times and not known it was there. It's tucked away behind a drug store and bank with no frontage.  So you have to look for it. We tried s little of everything. I had the gumbo and it was perfect and true to form for the picky of us. The only downside I could even call to mind was the catfish bites. A number of them had skin on them still, which is a no-no in my grandmothers kitchen. But they were still done right. Next time I will try the catfish poboy, we saw one come out that looked outstanding. One of the biggest criteria I have for Cajun is the red beans and rice...next time. Great food and nice folks. Stop in and give them a try."}
{"text":"I'd been seeing the flags for weeks and decided to drop by. at our table was the chicken breast étouffée, red beans and rice with andouille sausage and a roast beef po boy. BEYOND EXPECTATIONs! so delightfully Cajun. I'm an avid New Orleans fan and this rocked my taste buds. of course we had to finish with a basket of beignets!"}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend on a saturday evening for a early dinner and we were both pleasantly surprised when we walked in to find a live jazz band playing! We really enjoyed the atmosphere and the food was great! We got the Louisiana Seafood Platter and enjoyed every bite! We also got a side of fried okra and Beignets for dessert! Yummy!! Our server, Sara, was great  we'll definitely be back. We haven't had Creole food this good since we were in Louisiana! We're so glad there's somewhere to go now that is close to home! Cheers!!"}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere and staff!! I went for drinks and the entertainment and I am excited to go back and try the food!!! Wish you much success!!!"}
{"text":"Great food nice staff feel like I'm in New Orleans! They offer 32 beers and have hurricanes"}
{"text":"I love Cajun food, and this place has wonderful service and all the staff is so friendly.  We had Cajun hot wings, fried okra and the gumbo.  We will try the alligator when I can convince my wife, we will be coming here again!!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly not horrible.  After reading reviews here I was a little scared to give it a try.  However, I am glad I did. Went on Friday at 5 and just beat the crowd. Had draft beer at Happy Hour price.  Hub and I split oyster shrimp poboy. It was excellent.  Pros: Food great, portions generous, wide liquor selection, staff nice enough Cons: Staff is definitlely young and could use more training. Not friendly or welcoming.  One kid was in a lowcut tank top walking in and out of kitchen. Yuck. Also could use at least one non cajun item on menu.    Will definitely be back, am hopeful the place will continue to get better!"}
{"text":"Food is always great. Their beignets are to die for!! Service could be a bit better. Waitress seemed a bit distracted. Other than that, I will continue to go there to get my Cajun fix."}
{"text":"I sat at the bar and it took the 2 minutes to acknowledge me...not a great start..plus bartender has no idea how to pour a beer from the tap"}
{"text":"The service was horrible and the food was subpar. There was a definite disparity between blacks and whites. Hate that I went!! Also prices way to high for catfish fried to hard nuggets. If you're bold enough to go make sure Elaine doesn't wait on you; no worries she won't!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday afternoon. I really love gumbo and it's hard to find here in Arizona. They didn't disappoint...especially because I enjoy a thick, dark roux. I also ordered the catfish nuggets...y'all about big portion sizes!!! I was full after the gumbo! I'll be back when I am in the area for sure!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are not cajun food connoisseurs, but in saying that, the food here is delicious. My husband had the gumbo and it was amazing. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Tried for the first time  today and were pleasantly suprised. My husband had etouffe and an oyster po boy. I had a shrimp po boy and our kids had the fish platters.  Everyone loved their food. The po boys were yummy and crunchy but not overly greasy. The wait Staff was friendly.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Did the Yelp online order at 7p, it said it would be ready between 10-35 minutes, after order paid for it told us it would be ready 56 minutes after placed 7:56p. We arrived and stood at the door for 5 minutes before someone spoke to us. As we waited for our order another very long 35 min the wait staff stared at us like we did something wrong and no one ever came back to update us regarding our order or apologize. I had to ask again for our order at 8:09p, they were finally trying to put it together, we did not walk out the door with food until 8:15p, 1.25 hrs after ordering. Poor service, too long to wait for pickup, and when we arrived home they completely left out one of the orders but charged us the $10.95 for it! I will not return for take out and uncertain I will return to dine in as I was never apologized to or offered even a glass of water while I waited!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing, atmosphere is great, Ikey the bartender was very good - looking forward to coming back and trying the rest of the menu.  We had the andouille sausage , chicken and shrimp étouffée and the red beans and rice with andouille sausage great choice and all the items coming from the kitchen looked amazing   Only call out is the food came out of the kitchen slow, hopefully this improves as they are open longer.   Food deserves 4 stars - service deserves 4 stars but the wait for food killed it"}
{"text":"Very busy on opening day is not an excuse for our server to take our order and not get it to the kitchen. After waiting an hour I had to flag down another server, because ours had not come back to the table since taking our order. The service needs to be trained better in even the basics of taking care of the customer.   90 minutes after ordering, our meal was served.  The onion strings are crisp, sweet, and just the right amount of greasy. The jambalaya was nicely spicy, with good portions of andouille sausage, crayfish, and chicken in a rich, thick sauce. My wife said the grilled chicken po' boy was a bit spicy, too. Bring a healthy appetite when ordering the po' boy. It is really big.   I will probably come back to try the other items on the menu, once the opening bugs are worked out.   Three stars for now... good food, service problems."}
{"text":"I heard about Creole Cajun Bistro from a group I'm in on Facebook. I loved the fact that this was a B.O.B and I wanted to support. I told my fiance about it and he was just as thrilled to try it as I was! We had to drive about 45 minutes from our home on the west side to get here but it was well worth it!!! I had the Louisiana Seafood Platter...I was not prepared for the huuugggeee platter that came out but I'm not complaining because hey, everything was delicious now I have a meal or 2 for tomorrow since I took over half of it home lol!! I told my sister about this place and suggested we go back sometime because unlike my fiance, she'll love all that the platter had to offer (catfish, shrimp, oysters, fries and hush puppies) and it's definitely big enough for the 2 of us to share!! My fiance had the jambalaya and he said it was, and I quote \"FIYAH\"!!!!! He let me taste it too and I had to agree with him!!"}
{"text":"Before my rant begins I want to make it clear that I love keeping local businesses open and the 4 star should really be maybe a 3.5 solely on food..  It was our anniversary Friday, so the bf decided that we should try somewhere new, his co-worker had told him about this Cajun place that was delicious and asked how I felt about Cajun for dinner. ..  We had a little bit of a hard time finding the place since it is tucked away and if you just look at the map it almost looks as if it's in the same shopping center as Basha's, but it's behind CVS.  We walked in and get seated right away with menu's, we decided on appetizers and our main course 5 to 10 minutes later... but we haven't been greeted yet. Finally our server comes by and drops off some waters and asked if we wanted anything else to drink.. we let her know we were ready to put in appetizers, hush puppies jalapeño style and cajun onion strings please... 15 minutes has gone by and the bf's sprite was gone and water was half emptied and left on the side of the table... where's our server.. there's only 4 tables of couples and 1 larger party who were finished.. Our server finally comes by tells us our apps should be out shortly and asks if we were ready to order our meal.. Gumbo and the Jambalaya please! Our appetizers finally come out 20 minutes later.. bf absolutely loved the hush puppies! But the onion strings on the other hand were shaved wayyyy too thin.. it was all batter, like the onion disintegrated while it was fried.. 10 minutes later our server checked on us, we asked for a box for the remaining hush puppies but not the onions strings, she asked if there was something wrong, we told her, she agreed and that was that.. then I had to ask her to refill our cups since they've been sitting there empty for quite some time now. Patiently waiting for our meal,  I watched as another table after us get their food first,  hmm they must have not gotten appetizers as I thought to myself.. then our server walks up and shows us a blank check book and tells us our order got lost... and asked for us to repeat it.. umm funny thing is I don't believe it got lost, because I don't recall her ever writing it down and what the heck took her so long to realize our order was missing?! As irritated as I was I politely answered her... Our food finally came out 15 to 20 minutes later..   Bf's Gumbo was excellent! Tasty! DELICIOUS! NOW onto my Jambalaya! Yummy as well but a tad spicy for my wimpy butt.. but the chicken chunks in it were perfectly cooked, juicy and tender, definitely fresh and not over cooked at all! I asked for a box so I could save room for beignets, waited a good 10 to 15 minutes before I finally got up and asked for the check and our dessert to be to go... we really didn't want to wait any longer but I also really wanted these beignets... never got the check til I asked a second time.. no bag for our left overs were given either until I asked.. looked at the check and the onion strings were still on which was fine, whatever.. but I had to ask if their onion strings were always that thin she said no and remembered how we disliked it and offered to see if it could be taken off.. Finally 10 minutes later our dessert was brought out, and I guess the owner decided to give us a few extra for me and the little one in my tummy.. thanks that was a nice gesture... ate my beignets on the way home while listening to my bf tell me how that was the worst service compared to all the other crappy servers we get.. but yet the beignets were so amazingly delicious I couldn't stay mad..  So over all our server was super nice and friendly, but just not server material at all, sorry, not sorry.. we were so irritated with the little things that it ruined our dinner and made us just want to get the hell out of there, but then the food was so delicious that it was like a rollercoaster of emotions..  If we decide to eat there again I think we would just do a to go order.. so then we don't have to deal with bad service along with an almost 2 hour dinner time and still tip 20%...  Oh PS their Sausage is amazingly delicious! ;]"}
{"text":"I'll keep it short. The food was slightly better than average and felt a little over priced. The service was definitely lacking, but our server acknowledged it and was very apologetic. I don't know how much of it was actually her fault. The atmosphere wasn't anything special. The one nice detail was the selection of Abita beers on draft."}
{"text":"Creole Cajun Bistro is the perfect marriage of great service and food. The gumbo seasoning was excellent, there is no other place in Arizona comparable. My wife also thoroughly enjoyed her combination étouffée. To top it all off the peach cobbler isn't good, \"It's better than yo momma's!\" If you are interested in good food and entertainment, you must try Creole Cajun Bistro!"}
{"text":"I'm just gonna start with the fact this may be the coolest hole in the wall ever! From the people to the music to the food! Guy Fiety should get on a list soon cuz once this place is discovered by the food network it's over this will be undoubtedly the New SPOT!!! For everyone to try!!!!"}
{"text":"I would give 5 stars if the service was better. Slow start, expect to wait for service. But the food definitely makes up for it. Best Cajun food in AZ for sure. Etouffee with crawfish is a must!"}
{"text":"Super Yummy. Well worth the trip. Great staff. HUGE portions. A tad pricey. That's why only 4 stars."}
{"text":"Went here a couple weeks ago and had a fantastic diner! The service was excellent and the food was delicious. I would highly recommend the jambalaya and the fried catfish basket. Can't wait to go back!!!  The only thing that this place needs is a little better signs, but  now that I know where it is I will be a regular customer!"}
{"text":"Holy cow am I full!!!  Just finished eating and everything was so delicious I could not stop eating.  The gumbo is fresh and fantastic.  I tried a bit of everyone at the table's food as well, and you can sure tell each dish is made fresh and with a lot of love.  Even my daughter's Mac and cheese was great.  Try the fried green tomatoes and you won't regret it.  I can't wait to come back and eat here again.  The food is reasonably priced considering the portions and the taste that its obviously made to order.  Truly a culinary gem."}
{"text":"I put a lot of thought into this review. Not because I wanted to, but because the extremely long wait time left me nothing better to do. In the time spent waiting for your food, you could probably fall in love, get married, have kids, open up your 401k, and make your funeral arrangements.  The ambience was good enough. Nice, New Orleans feel and live music. Albeit very loud, I enjoyed the musicians' rendition of Purple Rain. Though with the wait time, they probably could have played Prince's entire discography.  The food was fine. Two of us ordered the etoufee and one of us got jambalaya. Food was decent but for how hungry we were and the very pricey cost it could have been way better. Or at least come with a side."}
{"text":"We had dinner here last night. Service was prompt, the crawfish étouffée was delicious. The server was happy to give us extra bread upon request. It's a little pricey, but overall a good experience."}
{"text":"What a joke of a restaurant. Stopped by tonight to try it out. Was told it would be twenty minutes before we could be seated. It was a Wendsday night and the place was half empty. I'll never try it again."}
{"text":"Although the food was tasty we left shocked at the $10.50 charge for 3 kids milk!  So kids dinners didn't come with any drinks but $3.50 for a kids cup is just outrageous. We could have bought three gallons for crying out  loud"}
{"text":"Amazing food.. great people.. great environment..  new favorite spot EVER !! must stop.."}
{"text":"Had the Frickles (fried pickles) for appetizer and creole shrimp etouffee for entree. So delicious! Husband had the Andouille Sausage sandwich. Food was fresh and tasty. So nice to go to a local, non-chain restaurant with great food and atmosphere. Good service. It's kind of tucked away in the back of the parking lot so you have to look for it, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"We have been looking forward to trying this place for awhile. I happen to like fried chicken but only when it's really good and my fiancé loves Cajun food.   Service was excellent, our server made suggestions and talked us into Mac n cheese bites. I had the fried chicken meal and he had gumbo and jambalaya. The mac n cheese was a lil different but alright, dip them in ranch. Personally, I didn't love the fried chicken,  it was a little over fried so the chicken was dried out. The hush puppies were pretty good.  The fiancé wasn't a fan of the jambalaya, he ordered it extra spicy since we were told it isn't that spicy and it didn't have much bite.   Gumbo fell into the same category of tasting mediocre.   The place is cute, the service was good but the food itself isn't enough to make us come back."}
{"text":"I didn't even know this leave existed until i came out of the parking lot on a side I don't usually use.... And thank goodness I did. Hubby and I went about 3 pm for a late lunch, ordered four dishes to try and were pleased with most of the food we ate. The red beans and rice were fantastic, the grits too, the fried green tomatoes were good, not a fan of the batter they use, but it was ok as was the catfish.  The etoufee was great as well as the andouille sausage. What made our visit even better was the service staff and the live music."}
{"text":"Great find today. Had the jambalaya and etoufee. Both were awesome. We will be back for sure. More to try."}
{"text":"Great shrimp po boys, best I've had outside New Orleans in fact. Haven't tried anything else there but that's mostly due to the price. I don't fault them for that though because the seafood actually tastes fresh. Friendly staff"}
{"text":"We visited on 10/21/17.....Band was too loud to start off with. I was excited when we found this place right here on Yelp. Looking at the pictures and menu we had to try and we are glad we did. Everything from the Seafood Platter, to the Shrimp Po' Boy, Jambalaya it was all absolutely delicious!! Huge servings of well seasoned foods. With a full fledged bar you can't go wrong.   The band that was playing that night was too loud and we ended up sitting outside. The restaurant isn't big at all and for the band to be playing that loud and singing horribly just wasn't cutting it for us. Very annoying! I thought it was karaoke night, that's how bad it was."}
{"text":"Excellent food here, went here after finding them in Yelp and was pleasantly surprised. Phoenix isn't really known for its Cajun/soul food.   Pros: very clean, waitress extremely friendly, food was delicious, large portions, Yelp cash back  Cons: a little pricey. food wait time is extremely long, even when not busy. One if times when if the waitress weren't so nice and attentive might have said something. Also the sides are way overpriced. I wish they offered a small side option instead of it being basically a second meal. I wanted collared greens, and they were delicious but the side was so big I couldn't finish even though if I remember they were around $5 additional. We also ordered baguette's for desert and ended getting them to-go because of how long the wait for them was.  In all the place is really good and we will definitely be back. Just now knowing how their portions are and the wait times will order differently. Good local joint."}
{"text":"I went back and everything was DELICIOUS just like my 1st visit. We had the Gumbo, fried chicken, Jambalaya, hush puppies. EVERYTHING was delicious. The owner mentioned in my previous review that he would address the loud music and sure enough it was a perfect ambience to sit, eat, conversate and still enjoy the  sound from the environment. The waiter was so extremely pleasant and always smiled with us. I really do love this wonderful find of a restaurant. Thank you again for offering all that you do."}
{"text":"There was a wait for food. It took what felt like forever because the smell coming from the kitchen is nearly an appetizer. The food did come and it was spectacular. The fried green tomatoes, the greens, the shrimp... holy s***. I'm talking slightly better than awesome... I will be back."}
{"text":"Great Cajun food. Right out of New Orleans. Abita beer on tap. Good atmosphere and great service"}
{"text":"Everything was great! My only suggestion is to use less breading. I had the catfish Mac and cheese it was great!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, staff was friendly. The frog legs were interesting, but the batter made them a bit salty or too gritty for my taste. But the rest of the food was amazing"}
{"text":"I have to say the food was worth the wait. The staff were extremely friendly and the drinks were flowing. If they can get the food out a bit faster they will be in great shape. I am all about supporting local businesses and I really hope this one makes it as the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Just popped in for a beverage and check out this place out.  OMG. the wings in swamp sauce are great.  Moose drool went down quite well with it I will definitely be back with friends.  It's a hidden gem for sure."}
{"text":"Excellent food, drinks and music. I have to write more for this to be a review and not a tip. So here's a tip, you have to try this place if you've not been here before."}
{"text":"We went here on a Wednesday night, party of 7, plenty of seating. The food was GREAT. We love New Orleans so we were excited to try it out. We had the fried okra -stellar, perfect!! We also tried the fried green tomatoes-also good. For dinner we had fried chicken, jambalaya, shrimp and grits, and pulled pork. Everything was hot and tasty! Yes it was a little pricy but for quality we thought it was worth it. Give it a try!!"}
{"text":"We are from Louisiana so we are pretty snobby when it comes to creole food.  This is the first place my husband said tasted like \"home\".   We love coming here. The appetizers are great - all of them!  Can't wait to try everything, but so far everything we have tried has been amazing"}
{"text":"Came in here for lunch today. Place was quiet with 1 waitress who was also the bartender. She was very sweet and polite. She got us our drinks. Was apologizing for things being slow. Didn't really notice it as we were talking and visiting among ourselves. We ordered shrimp poor boy and sausage poor boy with sweet potato fries to share. The portions are very generous and the 3 of us were full from sharing the 2 subs and even had some to take home. The subs were fantastic! Shrimp were very tasty crisp and hot. The sausage was very good and had a nice spice to it. Over all very nice experience in a quiet hidden little restaurant. We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Hidden gem. Great food and awesome staff. We are at the school next door and are always coming back for more! (Mac & cheese is a fav here) Had the shrimp po'boy for the first time and it's amazing! I usually go for the mac and cheese or fried green tomatoes (sooooo good!) but glad I tried something else! They have very generous portions (we usually share entrees or save it for a second meal!) love the atmosphere and definitely would recommend to anyone looking for some delicious Cajun food!"}
{"text":"The AZCentral article got us all excited and we couldn't wait to try real Cajun again. What a huge disappointing let down. I should have paid more attention to the negative reviews here as they pretty much sum up our experience. Arrived right at 3 pm for a late lunch, ordered three dishes to try and only one was fit to eat. The $6.00 cup of red beans, Andouille sausage and rice (could have had more rice) was good. We wanted to try a cup of Jambalaya, but couldn't. Why in the world wouldn't they have a cup of Jambalaya on the menu?  The $10.00 cup Gumbo must have been cooking all week. It was so spicy and over cooked neither of us could handle it.  The $30.00 Bayou Bucket (most expensive item on the menu) was the biggest disappointment. This is their signature item and we should have sent it back immediately. The crayfish had been cooked so long, they had turned black, shrunk and it was almost impossible to shell them. The shrimp had not been deveined and had turned into mush. The corn was a cob of watery corn paste. We had to ask for a crab cracker and went we asked how to crack it, the waiter said \"Well just crack it down the middle\". Following her advice we were treated to a gooey green glob of gills and broken shell. For a $30 item and their signature dish we were shocked that they would serve this to anyone. I can only assume that must have scrapped the bottom of the steam pot for our serving. The owner and staff came out and sat watching TV as we picked through the pile of black , fossilized crayfish, mushy shrimp, corn paste on a cob and two huge potatoes (makes it look like you have a mound of crayfish)  looking for something we could eat. No we wouldn't go back and if you haven't been and do go, I hope you aren't treated the way or served the horrible dishes we were."}
{"text":"Just tried to order food for the first time ever from this place and asked for it to be a to go order and they said no.  Who doesn't allow a walk in customer to order a to go order?  Not sure I'll ever try to go here again.  If it says on their website or online menu that they don't allow to go orders then I am wrong.  But after 10 min looking I don't see this as a warning to potential customers.  The waitress could've been a little nicer about it too."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying the food was very good. We got the frickles for our appetizer. For our meal, my husband got crawfish etoufee and was delicious!  I got the catfish sandwich. The catfish was very good, but it was served as nuggets, which made the sandwich a mess. Service was irritating and why we're giving them three stars. At first, not many people were there, and our waitress was very attentive, but too attentive. She would not go away! I would say she came by every five minutes. It was annoying, but at least she was there. Then, the place started getting busy and she disappeared to take care of all the drinkers. Both of our drinks (water) went dry, and after 20-25 minutes, when she finally came back, we just asked for To Go boxes and the bill. Both of us would go back, but I would probably opt for To Go."}
{"text":"Amazing food.  Great service with a southern family flare.  Wit h be back again real soon.  Loved it."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a Southern Creole Vibe, this establishment is The Truth!  The food is Great, the service is Great, the music is Great!!! The proprietor showed a sincere appreciation for his patrons. We were most impressed"}
{"text":"I write up several reviews for restaurants and have my Blog in which I try dishes and observe customer service at multiple restaurants.  I first tried Creole Cajun when I came across a Groupon for the place about three months back.  I brought in a large group of about 7 and we ordered everything from alligator, frog legs, catfish, fried chicken, corn fritters, wings and more.  And ended up walking out of the place paying about $100.  The prices..way to high, but at the time we enjoyed the food and some of the portion sizes, like for the fried chicken and catfish.    We loved loved loved the Sweet Corn Fritters, and have had a desire to try them again.  So I've been doing low carb dieting, and decided on my cheat day, I would go back for some chicken and corn fritters.  Being that I live out pretty far by about 30 minutes and while in town decided to call in a order.  First response was that they were having a 45 min delay in orders...45 min????....okay fine gives me time to get there.  Then I decide lets drop the chicken and just make it the corn fritters. So the waitress tells me over the phone, we'll call you if the order is ready before the 45 min.   So we get there exactly 30 min later the corn fritters have been sitting in a bag on the counter where it looks like they had been for a while.    We pay for the order which, on top of being sweaty in the bag where they had been sitting for a while, they were also smaller portions then you would get had you been sitting in the restaurant.  It was like a small bag of tator-tots.  But you know, I decide I would still have a go at them cause they were awesome the first time around.  After tasting one, I realized they were far from the mark that they were the first time.  What happened???? We were half way up the road, when I said I would call them and complain after myself and my companions both made the Eck! face.  I asked the waitress straight up ' Did you get a new cook? Is there something wrong with your fryer? Really, whats going on?'  She tells me ..'no same, cook, nothing wrong'  'Ah, nah ...there's something wrong!  They tasted like they were left overs that were heated up in old fryer oil.  So,they offer me a refund and I accept.  Thinking I would get it refunded to my card.  Four days later nothing.  I call back...'I'm sorry we didn't refund you be cause you didn't bring the fritters back'....What???? (5th what in one experience is a bad experience ) Was never told to bring them back, was told would be refunded nothing about turning around driving back and bringing back the mess.  But I still have them here in my dumpster and can most definitely dig them out and take them back.  But nope two words (Bank Dispute)!  Save your money and your time."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a good Cajun place, and I finally found a great one. You can't go wrong all was delicious. From the appetizer to the desert, all was perfect."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out since I'm from The south. Pretty disappointed. Fried catfish nuggets tasted muddy and dirty. Cajun sausage was pretty good. The staff was super slow and took forever to get our food. Prices are pretty high as well"}
{"text":"My first time here, simply AMAZING!  My wife is from Louisiana and all I heard from that side was Yums, a few moans and groans. What a great dinner.  Come and give it a try."}
{"text":"The staff was nice and very helpful since it was our first time here. My boyfriend and I came here in for a date and it was definitely hidden and quaint. The crawfish was fresh and the staff let us know that it was freshly flown in from Louisiana, however 4 stars because the etoufee was average. My boyfriend had the jambalaya and he felt the same about his."}
{"text":"This a small place with a great setting inside either bar high tops or booths. Could work for Sunday football! We loved the collard greens, just delicious and worth driving over for. We are Texans and wanted to try the crawfish. The very best beignets! Don't miss them!"}
{"text":"Authentic Cajun cooking nothing pre made. Food was great and that's where it stops service was soooooo slow we were completely uninterested in eating after waiting 1 hour and 45 minutes not happy at all."}
{"text":"We went here last night for dinner and the food was excellent.  The atmosphere is very laid back, which is nice and relaxing.  I ordered the shrimp and grits and it was the best I've ever had.  Besides the usual shrimp and grits they added andouille sausage on top with cheese.  Delicious!  My husband ordered the catfish etouffee and it had huge pieces of catfish in it.  Both servings were extremely large and filling.  The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because it took such a long time to get our food.  It took around 40 minutes to get our food, which is a very long time especially when you have kids with you who are hungry.  We ordered beignets after our dinner and the wait was so long for those that we ended up asking for them to go because we had literally been there for over two hours due to the wait for our food.  The waitress we had was excellent and she was at our table often to check on us and make sure we were doing ok."}
{"text":"I came here in search for beignets, but got a full meal as well and was not disappointed! Had alligator, sweet corn fritters, and chicken etouffee which were all amazing. The chef is from Louisiana and was nice to talk to. I'm surprised I had room for beignets after all that but they are surprisingly light yet decadent. Service was great and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Just had a wonderful lunch at Creole Cajun Bistro. Three thoughts... authentic, terrific service by CJ and great value. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We came in early around 11 as they opened on a Saturday.  Place was empty and service was casual- sit anywhere.  Their main courses - gumbo, shrimp & grits, burger and etouffee was excellent. (Girls did not like chicken nuggets - found it too crunchy).  The hush puppies and corn fritters were crunchy and moist in middle  - excellent texture and flavor.  Collard greens was on pointe.  The dessert - peach cobbler & whiskey bead pudding was just ok.  Good flavor on cobbler but not enough crust.  Bread pudding was too sweet and no whiskey flavor- all baked out.   Service decent.  Definitely coming back for more cajan fare.  Price for lunch for 5 adults and 2 children- $165 but we did order a lot.  Had lots of leftover to go."}
{"text":"This is our first visit. We are Creole fans and finding this in AZ was great!  We had the chicken dinner and Jambalaya. Both were amazingly authentic (I've spent a lot of time in southern Louisiana). So it was a great meal, atmosphere was excellent, service was superb. Food was delivered piping hot. We will go back for sure and are looking forward to their seasonal specials."}
{"text":"Gave it another try -- worse..... Had a $60+ dinner (for 2) with $8.50 drinks (well drinks) and $15 appetizer (average price of appetizers is about $13, with no Happy Hour menu). For those prices, would like a tablecloth and real napkin. Few of the entrees featured in the Yelp pictures are on the menu. Bottomline - unique menu/food, but high prices for what's still basically a neighborhood joint. Service is very slow, as noted in other reviews. Too bad all around - the neighborhood needs some good places, but I'd be surprised if the bistro makes it unless they make some adjustments to their menu and prices. Lots of other choices with some driving in the Chandler/Gilbert area at those price points. Won't likely be back......."}
{"text":"My daughter and I went for lunch, she had gumbo and I had shrimp & grits.  I've only had this dish once before, but I thought it was very good (gumbo was very good as well). The owner does all the prep for all the dishes (on his day off, of course!).  We were happy with the service, the owner was very inviting, nice greeting when we entered!  We will definitely go back!  Nice everything here!"}
{"text":"We came in tonight with a large group and had a less than great experience. Our server did her best but didn't know the menu, hadn't eaten most of the food and didn't answer the questions that we had. I feel this is a lack in good management  if you don't have your people eat the food, so they can make good suggestions. In addition there were several issues with the drinks and the food delivery times were ridiculous. 4 people in the group had finished their meals by the time 2 shrimp and grits orders were delivered. Ok food but for the price and experience I would pass. This is a non repeat for me.  ***added note as Eric the owner felt the need to respond****  It is true to make it easier on the service we agreed to allow the food to be delivered as it was ready. However, the food took at least 30-40 minutes between the first service and the last which we didn't expect. served. Yes we had 12 instead of 10 - Several people did enjoy their experience and again this was not about our server's inability to serve alcohol we were more than ok with that due to her age.  This review was about the restaurant not her in particular, although she did not know about the food as she told us she hadn't tried several of the dishes. I find it interesting that not once did we see a manager during our experience and yet the moment a negative review is posted the owner responds. One should consider the defensive posture of the owner when considering whether to try this restaurant."}
{"text":"This little hole in the wall is such a gem! The red beans and rice... OMG! Fantastic. Absolutely recommend giving this place a try. There are not many restaurants that aren't a big chain in this zip code so I'm grateful to have found this place. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This hard to find jewel is worth looking for. I absolutely love New Orleans style Cajun food and they have it. Forgot to take pictures but the shrimp and grits was heavenly as was the gumbo. We'll be back."}
{"text":"This place was delicious we had a shrimp oyster PO bo, and crawfish etouffee. The service was amazing and the beignets were to die for!"}
{"text":"Really awesome food, everything is piping hot and fresh.   Not being very familiar with creole or cajun food, I asked the waitress for recommendations and she suggested the gumbo. In my following visits I tried jambalaya, shrimp and grits and cajun etouffee. I enjoyed all of the dishes and finally asked a friend of mine who frequently visits N.O. to confirm this restaurant as a legit place. She agreed it was a very good representation of Louisiana food.  She ordered the dirty rice and beans with sausage. We noticed her dish only had 2 thin slices of sausage and notified the waitress who brought out a whole new bowl of beans loaded with sausage! In my opinion, be sure to order a dish with the andouille sausage, its is truly scrumptious.  I am also big fan of the sides/appetizers like fried green tomatoes, hush puppies, sweet corn fritters and fried okra. All portions are well sized and you won't leave hungry.  Be sure to share a plate of beignets! But they heat up well so order them anyways!!"}
{"text":"Say hello to my new favorite Cajun hideaway. I am shocked at how much I ended up loving this place. The interior is really relaxed and comfortable, great music (blues? jazz?), and most importantly, amazing food.  I got the andouille sausage Cajun style ettoufe and it was amazing. This is my new go-to place to take friends and family from out of town. If I had a time machine, I'd go back and find this place sooner so that I could enjoy it more."}
{"text":"Great food and service! I had a Catfish Poboy which was delicious and piled with fried catfish. My boyfriend had the Seafood Platter. It was big enough for both of us to share. Also a side of sweet corn fritters. We were warned about the longer wait time for the Platter which was nice. No complaints & definitely will be back."}
{"text":"First time here and read lots of the reviews and wanted to give it a shot since we live right across the street. For starters it took an hour or so to get our food is there only one cook in the kitchen? We actually saw people leave due to the food not coming out as fast as it should ..I know this is still new but please work on the efficiency of the food to the tables ..willing to try one more time in a few weeks tho.."}
{"text":"Food was great. Not sure why many were talking about the wait. We walked right in and probably only waited about 20 mins. One of us orded the fried chicken and the waitress said that this dish takes about 15 mins which was nice for her to let us know.   I had the crawfish etouffee it was pretty good,  the only issue I had was it was just a tiny bit bland. The other dish we got was shrimp gumbo it it was great."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today and it was great. I had the fried chicken and it was very good and the portion was huge. Wife had gumbo and collard greens and she said they were both better than any she has had in AZ. We will make this a regular spot."}
{"text":"Not worth the money for only a vague idea of Cajun cooking. Runny jambalaya with little thought to ingredients. Pictures and other reviews were very misleading. This place was run with a bunch of kids, well meaning and very helpful and nice, but no cook on site. Heard one kid ask the other who's cooking tonight. Daughter couldn't even eat the crawfish Mac and cheese. Son tried and seemed to like the crawfish and most of the seafood platter my wife split with him. Wife did not like any of it. Catfish and oysters tasted off and not seasoned well enough. I really wanted to like this place, but won't be back. $120.00 Saturday evening.  You are correct, I mistyped and have corrected. It was catfish.  The rest is as stated."}
{"text":"Had a great time food was wonderful  compliments  to the chef. Great place for live music."}
{"text":"I love this place. I would consider it to be a hole in the wall but definitely a hidden gem. Elaine was our server. She was fantastic. Very attentive but not overbearing. Knew the menu and her recommendations were delish. Red beans and rice, gumbo, and beignets were fantastic. Will definitely be back and will ask for Elaine!!!!  Update--- I forgot to mention it would be great to have an appetizer sampler platter. :)"}
{"text":"Great food!  A hidden little place but the food was excellent. We tried the fried chicken, jambalaya, fried shrimp, pickles etc.  All were good."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews we still wanted to give this place a try as it is in our neighborhood and we love to support local businesses. We went in and around 6:00 and there were a good amount of patrons (not too busy). Our waitress seemed a bit stressed and we could definitely tell that she was new but they all are, they just opened so nothing too alarming. We ordered our drinks and took a look at the menu. We were a little surprised at the prices for a bistro (high) but that's okay as long as he good is good. We asked about the red beans and rice and there is confusion on the menu as the bowl price does not reflect that there is no sausage included. You have to order the larger portion in order to get the sausage... Huh? We ordered the larger portion so we could have the full experience. Then we decided to get a shrimp po-boy which was very good (large portion), we ordered a cat-fish basket but the waitress didn't put that order in.. She said we didn't order that... Okay? My son ordered the Mac & cheese which was good but small for the price and no garnish.. Nothing for $7... We were thinking for a brand new restaurant especially with a shaky start that the owner would be there to ensure things were running smoothly... We didn't see anyone which was surprising. The staff is very under-trained and you can tell it's mainly due to lack of management. For he prices, this place is not worth the experience. Hope it lasts but sadly, it probably won't."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate at the Creole Cajun Bistro last night for the second time. We started with the fried green tomatoes.  For the entrees, I had the etouffee with shrimp, chicken and homemade andouille sausage and my wife had the fried chicken. Every single bite we had was absolutely fantastic! This restaurant is a hidden gem tucked away in the Southwest corner of Gilbert Road and Chandler Heights Road. I hope that everyone tries it once. If you do, you'll be hooked and become a regular just like my wife and I."}
{"text":"Finally got to try them out for lunch today. Service was friendly and fast. Had our food within 5 minutes of ordering. Husband had the crawfish etoufe and it was tasty. I had the shrimp po boy, it was huge. It was also good. We also tried the fried onion strings but I didn't care for those. I think it was the batter, a little heavy for me. While the food was good we did feel the prices were a little on the high side. Was 39 for our lunch and we had water. Would be nice to see some lunch specials or lunch pricing. We will probably be back."}
{"text":"I came to try their alligator. They seem to bread it with cornmeal which is different then how I had it elsewhere. It wasn't bad just something that was new. Their pricing is a little higher than average. I also had their bengeits which were pretty good."}
{"text":"I came here on s Sunday for a birthday brunch. The place advertised being open at 11, so that's when we arrived and we had to wait outside for an hour, we weren't the only people who had to!! Once we got in the waitress gave us a table that was horrible for a group, four separate booths for us with awkward conversation and wouldn't accommodate a change. Our drink orders were completely messed up and we left after waiting two hours, never told about the buffet by the waitress, as in when we were allowed to start eating...to clarify we knew there was a buffet and were looking forward to it. On the way out the sign said for guests to keep their stay to less than two hours. We were happy to leave and went close by on short notice with much better service."}
{"text":"Please do NOT get the étouffée- in no way does tomato sauce resemble what I was expecting. The beans and rice had to be split between 4 people because that was the only item we all agreed on was a good selection. The service was sub-par and I will not be going back. Nothing like New Orleans"}
{"text":"Please eat here so they will stay here. Good food! Exceptionally clean restaurant. Love the waitress."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere/music.  Both food and service were excellent... next time I'll save room for dessert!"}
{"text":"Sooooo, the service is excellent! I'm from Alabama and have frequented New Orleans over the years and I must say, this restaurants is legit! Everything we had was exceptional. The veggies a little over cooked but hey, that's the southern way! The only difference in here and a lot of restaurants throughout the south and Louisiana is the salt content. The batter here was different and didn't contain too much salt! ! Stop it with the high blood pressure! Great job to the chef and owners. Great vibes and they have live jazz music on the weekends. Go and enjoy, you will not be disappointed. We will be back, for sure!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten there several times and the food and drink selection is great.  Good quality, nice portions, good value and a clean little place.  My only minor ding would be that the wait staff is either great or not so much based on who you get.  I think for a new family owned restaurant they could all be a bit more friendly."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch and it was good, not great. I called my order in as a pick up and I was told it would be ready in 30 minutes. A little disappointed in the wait time, but I gave it a try anyway. I had the shrimp po'boy. The portion was big enough for two people to share which was great, but nothing about the sandwich screamed wow! Maybe my expectations were too high. I wouldn't be opposed to going back and trying something else."}
{"text":"They are rolling now. Still working out the kinks. However I love this place. Perfect Music. Great Atmosphere Did the Red Beans and Rice with sausage at the bar with Shrimp Po Boy to go. Ikey the Bartender is new and has Flair!! Sit at the bar if you can. Great drinks. Awesome service for a new place. Red beans and rice with sausage was outstanding. I'll be back to to try everything. Appears to be the real deal to me.  Losing one star as it's still taking a little long to get your meal."}
{"text":"A nice and slow paced dinner at a local owned restaurant is what I wanted and received!  Tucked away behind CVS this small, intimate place shows off authentic Cajun, creole food. Fried alligator was not frozen and the side sauce was delicious. Chicken basket had 3 breasts with a buttermilk coating. Fried to inner juicy perfection. Hush puppies too were well seasoned. Afraid of greasy fried?  None to be found. Cajun style efoulfee was spicy but amazing. Will be back for crawfish for sure."}
{"text":"Portions were huge! Had frickels for an app. Beefy pickle were great.  Red beans and rice had excellent flavor (smokey sausage and bountiful beans). Had fried catfish PP boy. Should have shared sandwich"}
{"text":"What awesome food, atmosphere, and service! Eric and his staff made our dining experience amazing by helpful suggestions on the menu. Always made sure we were well accommodated by filling our drinks. Hint, you will get far more than you paid for with large portion sizes. A dining experience you will always want to repeat. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I give this place two thumbs up. The food has amazing flavor. We ordered the bbq shrimp appetizer and it blew my mind. The corn fritters are also really good. The po boy's are huge and delicious. The crawfish Mac and cheese is good but not amazing like the bbq shrimp and po boy were. If you like sangria, then you will not be disappointed.   Also, the bread pudding is really really good. Order it with a side scoop of ice cream.   The place is a little small so make a reservation or avoid Friday/Saturday dinner rush."}
{"text":"Authentic! Closest thing to New Orleans we've found in Phoenix. The decor reminds you of Bourbon Street.  Sorry we missed the live music.   The servers were very friendly.  Don't expect your food to come out fast but it's worth the wait.  The crawfish ettoufe was delicious with crawfish in every bite. But the shrimp and grits ... oh yeah! Buttery and the shrimp was cooked perfectly.  Just enough heat. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I was born and raised in New Orleans, LA. With that being said, this place is sub-par. Unfortunately, my husband and I decided to try their boiled crawfish. That was a big mistake - the crawfish was HORRIBLE! There's no way they used a seafood boil mix and salt, NO WAY! This place would be out of business shortly after opening if they tried to sell that crawfish in Louisiana. We also ordered po boys, those were just ok. Didn't satisfy my craving for Cajun cuisine. I'm not sure where these folks are from, but it's not Louisiana. I think maybe the \"chef\" learned about Cajun cuisine in culinary school but not from the experts in Louisiana. I wonder if any of them have even visited Louisiana and tried the food. What they're offering is not even close to my expectations for Cajun cuisine."}
{"text":"Great family owned restaurant!! There's totally a Louisiana feel to the atmosphere. The staff are very friendly. Had the Etouffe and it was delish!! I recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"I went here last week and ordered a fried green tomato po boy and the frenched wings with sweet and spicy swamp sauce and friends . The po boy was delicious per my mom she loved it I actually had a few bites and it was good now the wings and fries where another story the sweet and spicy sauce is more of a vinegar sauce also the wings were not cooked throughly I had to cook them In the oven myself when i got back to my house which was 5 mins away also the fries where soggy as if they had be sitting for awhile.. I know now not to get things at a restaurant that they are not known for.. doesn't come out as good  Update: he didn't like my review on yelp So he went to my fb and messaged me"}
{"text":"DoorDash delivery. I was feeling a little spicy. Dinner was absolutely delicious. Delivery was great food was still hot.... great Cajun choices. Not disappointed."}
{"text":"The food here was awesome. Started with fried green tomatoes - the breading was perfect! Had the jambalaya for entree - shrimp seemed fresh , chicken and andouille tasted great - sauce was rich with just the right heat. I was surprised nobody else here after reading reviews, but service was attentive as you'd expect with nobody about , but not intrusive. Pricing was a little high maybe, but not outrageous. Will definitely be back, probably soon."}
{"text":"I met some friends for the reverse happy hour (HH) last Friday night. There was a decent amount of drink and food specials on the HH menu. There was a DJ, who was a nice enough guy, but I wasn't a fan of the music. I like the vibe of the place. The food was good too! We stayed until just past closing, playing cards! They never asked us to leave. I had a nice time and would return."}
{"text":"Had a quick lunch..food was hot, tasty and we'll worth the money..can't wait to go for dinner sometime. .only suggestion I have is to create smaller portion lunch specials..otherwise great experience. ."}
{"text":"I recently moved to AZ and I've been on this gumbo kick for the past week I've tried 4 places in the past week (yes my craving has been crazy) Hands down the best I've tried ... Thank you!"}
{"text":"Food is average and the cocktails are very sweet. The staff is very nice and friendly. If you like fried food you might like it more."}
{"text":"A place to visit. Glad they have a restaurant like this in Chandler. Fan of beignet and etouffe. Coming back for the bar next time."}
{"text":"I think this place is greAt. Love the authentic food and jazzy atmosphere. I've tried the crawfish Mac and cheese, fried green tomatoes, fried okra, and the etouffee. It's a hidden gem and I mean hidden. Located behind a CVS and hard to find unless you know it's there and that would be the only complaint. Five star for good authentic southern food."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch on a Sunday afternoon and it was not busy. The place is decorated well and the waitress was very friendly and attentive.  The andouille, chicken and shrimp etouffee was quite tasty. Although the roux in the sauce was not as dark as I like it, it did not take away from the homely flavors. The collard greens side dish was also tender and yummy.  The seafood boil had plenty of crawfish in it and tasted good at well. It was missing sausage which they offered as a side dish. Since the boil is already somewhat pricey, it would be nice if the boil included the sausage  as well.   Overall, I highly recommend the restaurant and will definitely be back to try some other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Nice little restaurant that serves tasty, good food.  If you like creole or Cajun food you will enjoy your meal.  The po'boys are large and stuffed with your choice of sea food.  I had an oyster and shrimp and loved it.  Others in our party had the jambalaya and etouffee.  Both were very good and the portions are large.  You can also find frogs legs, fried tomatoes and fried pickles on the menu.   The prices are reasonable for what you get."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this: great enviroment, clean restaurant with great service.   When we first walked in, we were immediately greet and seat down anywhere of our choice. Shortly after, our waitress showed up with our drinks and also helped us with deciding our menus. Food did take a bit long to prep only because alligator meat and chicken must be fully cooked. I appreciate the fact that the waitress noticed our food was taking longer than what was served in other tables. She took an initiative to peek inside the kitchen for us and keeping us posted.   For appetizer, we ordered allegator meat and chicken wings with Lemon flavor (first time trying allegator meat btw....). My friends are right. It does taste like chicken. The chicken wings are super meaty and absolutely delicious. For our main course, we order thr famous jambalaya. Wow that was so tasty!!!! For dessert, we order Beignets (also my first time trying it). It was so sweet, fluffy and delicious. I highly recommend it to other yelper.   Again, kudos to the wonderful service. When we were about to wrap up our meal, again our waitress took initiative asking us if she could order the dessert since the restaurant is getting busier. It is much appreciated. I highly recommend anyone who wants to try Cajun food."}
