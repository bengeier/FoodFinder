{"text":"I have been to this location many times and I always have a great experience. Staff is friendly and service is fast, and I have never had an issue with my order. Whether walk up or drive thru they always get it right!"}
{"text":"Had a chicken sandwich with 'supposedly' large fries last week. Bland sandwich tasteless, fries were said to be large but they were so less that I cud count them on my fingers! I don't think I wil ever visit them again."}
{"text":"Always quick and great late night customer service.  The staff is helpful and engaging"}
{"text":"Ordered a cheeseburger but got no cheese. The burger was smaller than the bun by a good centimeter all around. Wife got a pork sandwich that was edible but looked awful. The milkshake was delicious. We got the peanut butter chocolate. It tasted like a Wendy's frosty with peanut butter flavor.   The food was cheap, I'll give you that. No seating, take out and drive-through only."}
{"text":"This Cook Out location needs a reevaluation of its sanitation code....98.5 must be a joke.  The floors were so slippery with grease that you slide while standing.  You could see the layers of grease and finger prints on the trash bins."}
{"text":"This last Sunday, 5/21/17, we went to Cookout here on Franklin Blvd. in Gastonia NC. I have never had such a terrible experience just trying to place a drive through order. I seriously thought that they were alernatingly turning on the mic and listening to every other word I was saying. I had to correct a simple 2 burger order 3 times, I had to correct a milkshake order 3 times, and a side order 2 times. And the final straw was when I asked her to repeat the order back to me, because I was sure she got it wrong. I understand if someone is new, but listening and speaking skills are pretty important in a fast food business. So after she got the whole order wrong, after all the corrections, I just told her to cancel the order. It was obviously too difficult to hear or do their job right: huge burger, just the burger, cheddar style: another huge burger, just the burger, cookout style no onion add ketchup: 2 corn dogs, 2 large seasoned fries, and one cherry cheesecake milkshake. I seriously doubt we will be back  any time in the near future. Which is a shame, because we love the food and typically the quick accurate service. I don't know what has happened to the service. It has been slipshod the past few visits. I suggest getting a better mic and speaker system."}
{"text":"Stopped by this Cookout while doing errands nearby. Ordered burger, fries and a milkshake. Burger was tasteless and the bun was hard and cold. Milkshake was fine but not outstanding.  Called the company number on receipt and got an apology and the promise of free meal cars. I used it recently at a Cookout near Independence. And the food was not appreciably better.   A chain I will avoid from now on; a place like Steak and Shake is much better in my opinion."}
{"text":"SO YUMMMM. Had lunch there today. Plenty of food for a little over $5!..with a regular drink! :)"}
{"text":"This location is fantastic especially considering the amount of customers in line some days. They are generally very quick for heavy volume especially compared to other local fast food locations. Food has always been fantastic as well. Never had an incorrect order. Worst part about this place is the difficulty getting to it due to construction."}
{"text":"Normally when I come get my usual cheddar style burger tray, the burger is perfect. Juicy meat with hot melting cheese overlaying perfectly crisped bacon. Last night was a different story. The meat was burnt so badly it had a extremely foul smell like a mixture of vomit and burnt human skin."}
{"text":"One they made my nuggets in to rocks which is ok stuff happens but when the manger will not stop to talk to you that is and when you say I'll take a smell bugger instead and they give you not a small but a big and then charge you wrong for that then the manger still will not talk to you. Stuff happens but hiding and not being rude about it is not ok."}
{"text":"Great food for takeout burgers, they are sometimes on the salty side but i would take these over any other fast food burger in the city.  Everything is fresh, cooked to order and never had a mistake. The shakes are pretty good too.  This cookout is newer than some others and is probably the best one."}
{"text":"Good food and great employees, but the facilities are trashed. This place needs cleaning and maintenance. The front window has been broken for weeks and the other windows are filthy. Clean your investment!"}
{"text":"If you want fast food that doesn't taste like fat food this is the place.  The burgers aren't just sitting there waiting for you like most fast food joints.  The milkshakes are awesome and you have plenty to choose from. I like getting a combo with my burger, fries and a corn dog. Nice!"}
{"text":"Best shakes around... without a doubt. Service with a smile, great food and easy on the wallet. One of my favorites!"}
{"text":"First time dining from here, was coming home from work and decide to go through the drive-thru. After driving away I found that the burger I had ordered did not have lettuce or tomato, only ketchup. I did not bother going back although I was charged 10 cents for the lettuce, not a big deal but the lack of attentiveness concerns me and if they do something like that regularly it adds up. The employee that took my order was rather hasty and at the window the employee looked and acted as if they did not want to be there. I would recommend better training for their staff."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Cook Out for 10 years.  I can honestly say this one location is the best Cook Out I've ever had, and I've been to at least 10 different locations.  The first time I came to this Cook Out, it was perfect.  Food was pristine & speedy and server was super friendly.  10/10.  I didn't get to Charlotte again for 6 months, but even after so much time, the 2nd go-round was just as perfect as the first.  The 5th star here is for consistency."}
{"text":"I was on lunch break and was picking up 3 people's lunch. The first two came out quickly (with wrong sides that I didn't notice until later) but they forgot about the last order. I sat and waited patiently for about 10-15 mins before asking about it. The boy at the front counter said they must have forgotten and that it'd be just a minute. 10-15 mins later I'm still sitting there waiting on my food. A couple of people from the kitchen kept poking their heads out at me and looking me square in the eyes. I finally got back up and asked again. The boy said \"they must have forgot again\" I said \"after you reminded them?\" To which he said yes and that it'd be out in a minute. It came out with the wrong sides but I said whatever and let them know and left. I may eat here again if they get their act together."}
{"text":"Can't beat the amount of food for the price. It's nice to be able to add items other than the typical fries to the order. Onion rings are a great side item. Or go for a quesadilla and corn dog for your sides. And who doesn't love the milkshakes."}
{"text":"Love Cook Out!!!  Great BBQ, Great burgers and great shakes.  The food is top quality and cheap!  This location even has a dining room - unheard of!  My family of 4 ate full meals for less than 20 bucks.  You can even split the chicken finger plate between two people.  The BBQ plate - $3.99 - that's right!  And it is AWESOME!  This is not a fancy place, but a great fast food joint.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"If Crispy Chicken Cajun wrap means cooked til incineration with red powder over it and put together like a piece of trash, the I guess I got what I paid for.  The restaurant ambiance was enhanced by the sour pussed order taker, I could not get her to smile.  The Cookout web site would not take my comments, I guess they are happy with what they serve."}
{"text":"Good place for Cajun chicken! Cheap and best ! The combos were very cheap with varieties! But sometime the the sandwiches are not crispy! Just small issue! Very near to my place!"}
{"text":"All I can say is that \"YOU HAVE TO GO\"! This food is amazing,cheap, and good. I wish they had one in Seattle. UGH!"}
{"text":"One of the best Cookout establishments in Charlotte! Their char grill chicken sandwhich, cheddar style, will make you a loyal follower. The service is always prompt and I never encountered a rude employee. If you've never had Cookout, then is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Came here on my way up to Winston.  I had a small cheeseburger with pickles, grilled onions, ketchup, and mustard.  I also had a regular hot dog, \"Cook Out Style,\" which had chili and slaw on it.  I chose hush puppies as a side.  Of all the items I had, the hush puppies were the best.  The burger and hot dog were \"meh,\" though I do and did like the Carolina Slaw on the hot dog.  Yeah -- the hush puppies -- for .99 cents.  You can't beat that!  I washed all this down with a healthy serving of Cheerwine.  It's great to be in the South, and I'll come back to try other menu items -- and yes, it'll all be washed down with Cheerwine!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot for late night eating.  Fortunately it's close to my house, so I can satiate the post-drinking munchies that inevitably happen. The staff is friendly and quick, and the prices are unbeatable.    I don't like a rut; always having \"the usual\" at a restaurant, but the Cook Out Style burger is what always drags me in.  I can't pass up that cheese, chili and onions.  My lady had the cheddar and bacon burger in a recent late night adventure to Cook Out and she gave it rave reviews.  I only got to gnaw on a tiny piece of bacon, but it was enough to make me want to try it the next time I'm hungry for some grease."}
{"text":"First off, if a customer asks if your fries have the skins on them, you should probably know what skins are and not just say \"no, they dont have skins\". Second, this was the worst \"club\" chicken breast sandwich I've ever eaten. The bacon was chewy and undercooked. there was enough mayonnaise to satisfy the entire Canadian nation. For the life of me I cannot fathom why you need to dip your buns in butter for a chicken sandwich. This was my first and last visit here or ANY cookout. Also, could have done with out all the religious music and bible quotes everywhere."}
{"text":"I've been to my last and final Cook-Out.' I just don't get the hoop-lah about this franchise. I've visited over a dozen locations and what I've discovered, is that they most certainly don't know how to make a real, juicy burger. The patty is consistent to tasteless sawdust pressed together. There is no juice to see or taste. If not for the toppings, there'd be no taste at all.  \"If not for the toppings, there'd be no taste, at all!\" Now, that's a song to remember. Either increase the fat ratio or quit pressing the juice from the patty, during cooking."}
{"text":"Do NOT go there! This restaurant stole my credit card information and sent it to someone in Georgia, who tried to buy lots of stuff. Luckily, my credit card company caught it in time. The restaurant is already under investigation for criminal behavior. Buyer beware!!"}
{"text":"Hot dogs with chili, chicken, burgers, milk shakes and open till 3am on weekends; what more could you ask for?  This is a really great place to grab a bite to eat after hours.  I've eaten here at all times of day and night and the quality of the food remains consistent (i.e. the chili at 2am has yet to make me sick).  The staff always seems friendly and 9 times out of  10 they'll get your order right.  If it's your first time visiting a Cook Out, I suggest skipping the drive thru and walking up the the window in order to familiarize yourself with the menu.  The menu is large and I mean very large, along the lines of 140+ items.  You'll get confused really quick if you try to just drive up and go through all the options in a matter of seconds.  The exceptionally large menu also has a ton of milk shakes.  Note:  They have weekly specials that aren't on the regular menu, be sure to look at the big board near the street to see what the specials are."}
{"text":"This location is decent. Fast service and good food ...everything you'd expect from a fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"I have never ever EVER heard of cook-out before this weekend and BOY was I missing out!! I had the BBQ plate and a banana pudding milkshake that was so thick with banana and Nilla wafers you had to eat it with a straw. OMG was the food delicious and can we say inexpensive?? My platter cost $3 and I got BBQ,fries, hush-puppies and coleslaw. The menu seemed endless and I was seriously STUCK in the drive-thru for about 3 minutes(seemed forever) trying to order. LOL. I loved this place so much we made it a necessity to stop at every one we came across as we left out of North Carolina."}
{"text":"When I came to Charlotte not too long ago for a family trip, we ate at Cook Out probably more than like four times lol. It's cheap! And it's pretty good. The portion sizes are good enough for what you pay for, so I can't really complain about that. And you seriously can get a shake for a dollar more if you end up getting the $5 dollar combo (1 entree, two sides and a drink and/or shake).  I'm pro Cook Out."}
{"text":"Food is outstanding and price is even better. For $4.50 you get an entree (huge chicken strips, chicken sandwiches, burgers, etc), 2 sides (and they have a ton of sides to choose from) and a large soda. It is a ton of food and is always hot and fresh. There is absolutely no better deal in Charlotte for how much food you get and how hot/fresh it is. The downfall, in my opinion, is how rude the staff can be and how they rush you every time you order. If you say \"give me a minute to look at the menu\" they get pretty peeved. The younger girls have a ton of attitude and we have considered not going back, but the food is so good and cheap. Only other downfall is  that they don't give you a bag when they hand you your dinners, so if you are ordering for your family I would honestly bring something like a reuseable shopping bag to get it all back home. Oh, and if you order chili as a side, please know that you are not getting a bowl of actual chili. It's a small condiment bowl with the kind of thick chili you would put on your fries. It's good, just isn't a lot and isn't \"soup\"."}
{"text":"Bleached-blonde girl working drive through at 3:02 on 3/10/16 should be fired --she was a complete turd! Don't think my family and I will go back."}
{"text":"Ordered a grill chicken sandwich with bbq sauce, and it came with everything on it. Took back the receipt , and they refused to give me a refund. I don't mind a business making an honest mistake. Just do right by the customer (a former regular at that)."}
{"text":"The people here are completely rude. They get your order wrong because they don't pay attention to what you're even ordering. And then they act like correcting THEIR mistake is just the biggest problem in the world. I love cookout food, just wish I didn't have to leave here angry."}
{"text":"Hands down the best fast food joint in Charlotte. If you're in NC in a place that has a Cook Out nearby, and you don't go there, you're missing out on the awesomeness. Amazing shakes, great grub, and open till the wee hours of the morning, what else can a hungry student ask for?  Good hot dogs, decent hamburgers, great hushpuppies and chicken nuggets and even more awesome shakes. So deliciously thick and tasty, and you can mix up to 3 different flavors in a single shake - and lots of amazing options to choose from! Not a whole lot of space outside to sit, although there are a couple of tables set up, but your best option is to go with the drive-thru. That said, be prepared to wait in the queue up to order in the drive-thru, especially at night, up until the 4 or so in the morning, since there'll be a lot of folks clamoring to get their shakes at that time. Do check out the combo tray, and you can replace the soda with a shake for a small extra charge, but that should be really filling, and at 5 bucks, it's a steal."}
{"text":"Super great fast food that doesn't taste like fast good. The burgers were amazing and so was the chili. Pretty sure everything is great.  Menu can be a bit overwhelming but it is so worth it."}
{"text":"Best fast food place for me and it's right down the road.  I have to say their shakes are better than any place else.  My kids love it! I like the hush puppies"}
{"text":"Had the worst experience here. Couldn't get my order right for nothing. Asked for ketchup, slaw, chili and cheese left off the cheese and the ketchup. Ended up with onions that i didn't ask for as well as mustard and  paid almost 2.00 if not that for items I  never received. Very upset at this will never come back here ever again. Thanks a lot for your bad service."}
{"text":"I give this three stars for the soul reason of order accuracy. I have never been here and they get the order correct for all six of the people in my family. I do not go through the drive through because of the same reasons mentioned in other reviews. If you don't mind going to the counter after you receive your order to get something fixed, this is a good place. It is indeed the \"best deal in pineville\""}
{"text":"Delicious. The burger is authentic, NOT frozen. And the Reese's milkshake is amazing."}
{"text":"I love cook out but this location is really hit or miss, mostly miss. We went and got 4 trays the other night and waited 21 minutes. In that 21 minutes 2 people came back because their orders were messed up. The sad part is they weren't that busy, but employees were busy goofing off. I'm not sure why it took so long but I'm pretty sure 2 of our trays sat while waiting on the others, or at least the 2 with fries. The fries were gross and they couldn't have got any more grease on my burger unless they served it in a bowl. We eat at cook out at least once a week and I order the same thing every time and every time we come to this store it's roulette. All our future trips to cook out will be to 74."}
{"text":"If I could give this a no star I would might be the worst cookout I've ever been too. Staff and manger so rude went to order food was cut off during the order sat there for 10 min while the same person taking order was taking other people orders in other line. Never came back to finish my order so I pulled up to the window where the lady had the worst attitude and told me she told me to wait so I asked to speak to the manger which it didn't get any better there she was just as rude will be contact the number on the cups reporting this!!!! Oh and the manger or the lady that said she was lied about her name so guess will tell them the day and time so they can look up who was on the clock go to different cookout"}
{"text":"This cookout is consistently bad. The guy who took my order was great, whoever prepared the food obviously doesn't care. I won't ever eat at this one again."}
{"text":"HOOOOOLY COW!  I always see a line wrapped around the building in the drive-thru and decided to stop in. The food is way cheaper than McDonald's and taste waaaay better!  I got a double cheeseburger, large fry, and drink for just $4.69! Authentic cookout flavor! This place is now my fast food stop. So long Ronald McDonald!"}
{"text":"This is a good location they have prompt service and great food like the cookout chain is known for!"}
{"text":"My son is addicted to the chicken quesidias... Good fries and lots to choose from, and easy on the wallet.."}
{"text":"Great menu with a lot of choices.     The restaurant was extremely busy - the order was incorrect.  Hush puppies were cold and received 1 onion ring."}
{"text":"Best fast food joint!  Quick and friendly seervice.  I come here at least once a month and order drive through.  Soany choices but I always get the same tray.  The chicken quesadillas are so much better than the place across the street!!"}
{"text":"I love CookOut ~ in NORTH CHARLESTON SC!!!! This one SUCKS!!!! Went to Carowinds, on mini family vacation, which is how we ended up with this unexpected experience at a Cookout ..This cookout was close to the hotel and being that we were tired from a long day and the cook out back home is AWESOME, we thought great, go get full and go to bed.. WRONG!!!!  There must be a cow field near by because as soon as you pass the Jack In Box, the whole area smelt like cow manauer!! Should have been a sign to TURN BACK NOW!!!  Anyways Cookout itself, I know a lot of young people work at fast food establishments, but this place has hired every incompetent, immature young person in the area.. Hoarse play, hu, what, replies, and a whatever attitude..   We asked for salt n pepper, that we didn't use, because the pepper was soaked through with soda.. I can't believe he even dumped that into my hands.. Once back at the hotel, we see our food.. The fries - none of us ate them.. They were WET with grease, but cold and uncooked.. My burger was burnt to the point of crunching.. That's all I tasted BURNT.. My daughter had chicken strips, she at 1/2 of one, they were dark brown and I'm assuming BURNT!!!  The shakes, cookout is known for their shakes, but this cookout put them to shame.. My chocolate shake taste like, kind of like, a vanilla malt. Honestly I can't even describe it..  So you if you are from out of town and like your Cookout, do NOT eat here.. The experience will turn you off from Cookout completely!! And if your from this area and have shunned Cookout, after eating here, try another one.. They are not all disgusting like this one.."}
{"text":"Decent prices for very good food. The milkshakes are incredible...any possible mixing and fixins for around $2.70."}
{"text":"Please do not eat here you will be surely be disappointed!!!  On the way home from picking my kid up from dance class I stopped by this place and had the worst experience with a fast food resturant ever. I went through the second drive through station and dealt with a cashier who could not get my order correct to save her life. When I finally made it to the window to pay (5 min later), the fun had just begun. The order was wrong, of course!! And to add insult to injury the food was under cooked. And the  fries were disgusting to say the least. So I asked the cashier at the window to kindly replace the fries with hush puppies. She reluctantly took back the fries and said \"the wait time for hush puppies will be 3 min...is that cool with you...\" Who talks to customers that way??? Completely unprofessional. So when she finally handed my back the container guess what was still in there. Those nasty, disgusting fries and 3 hush puppies. I was speechless.   At this point I had been there for 15 minutes and mind you there was no cars ahead of me. So this interaction should have took only 5 minutes.  When I finally was able to regain my speech I politely asked  for her to remove the fries from the container and I will keep the hush puppies. No apologies, no empathy, no sympathy NOTHING. I drove off knowing that my business is not valued.. I will never eat at this place again. Oh yeah the best part is there was no phone number on the receipt. So there was no way I could inform the manger except to go back to that awful place."}
{"text":"Ok food, inaccurate prices.  I  had never heard of Cookout before so I decided to look it up online before going. The online menu sounded fantastic, consisting of a huge variety of choices and all for prices under $2.50. I guess I should have known if it sounds too good to be true then it probably is.  I ordered a cheddar style burger and shake and the total came to $7.11 which is pretty pricey for a drive-thru fast food joint and really irritated me because it was almost $2.00 more than the prices shown on their official company website. I am not trying to sound cheap but I HATE when companies do false advertising or fail to update their websites, it's misleading.   As for the food, the burger itself was good and the bacon pretty tasty but the cheese oozing all over it was not. I LOVE cheeseburgers and can't remember ever disliking one in my life, but the cheese they used tasted like a a cheap over-processed American singles slice from the grocery store, even though it was clearly listed on the menu as Cheddar. They also didn't offer any condiments but luckily I had some ketchup at home to try and drown out the cheap cheese taste. As for the shake, it was pretty good but tasted more like Vanilla with a hint of Peanut Butter, rather than the Peanut Butter Fudge flavour I ordered.  All in all this place is ok if you are in the area and desperate but for the price you can definitely get better elsewhere."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a salad or low-carb meal, I would not suggest Cook Out. If you have a problem with deep fried food, I would not suggest Cook Out. If you are looking for a sit-down restaurant with a beautiful view, I would not suggest Cook Out. Now that we've gotten that out of the way!   I first went to Cook Out at the urge of a coworker who could recite the entire menu from memory. I ordered a hamburger tray, which is their version of a combo, with fries and onion rings and a huge tea to drink. I was surprised at how their hamburger reminded me of going to a family cook out and eating a fresh hamburger from the grill. Their fries are crispy, their hush puppies are delicious, and their milkshakes are smooth and full of fresh mix-ins. I've tried all the trays except for the BBQ tray and they area all great. My personal favorite is the foot long with chili. I would recommend getting it to go and they are open until 3 for late night snacking."}
{"text":"When new, this was the go to spot for burgers in Indian Trail. Now? burgers taste like they have been doused in lighter fluid. Maybe it was just the last two or three times we went. Maybe I should give them another go. Still one of the best milkshake collections around."}
{"text":"Nope. I heard decent things. I went and got burnt food. I am disgusted and will never go back."}
{"text":"Out west chicken sandwich was good Corn dog was hours old Tea was mediocre  Staff was friendly  Bathrooms hadn't been cleaned in days Via ring around the toilet"}
{"text":"I have never eaten at Cook Out before and never need to again. The burger was small but tasted ok. I had a shake but it wasn't good either, it was truly soft serve ice cream with Hershey's syrup. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Worst drive-thru cashier ever; they only get worse and worse. I was here last week and the cashier was awful; came back in a different day and with a different cashier but god, they impressed me in a horrible way tonight: this drive-thru cashier was worse than the previous one."}
{"text":"The burgers are fantastic!  The fries and onion rings are institutional.  The tables and lobby are not kept as clean as they should be.  I formed my opinion based on several trips during a recent visit."}
{"text":"Great value.  This location is actually located in Pineville, NC.  However, the map is correct.  :). Extensive menu.  Most will find something they like."}
{"text":"Today was bad. Usually Cookout doesn't fail. But today you have a spy from the Golden Arches! My burger was wrong, the chicken wrap was dry and the fry oil needs to be changed."}
{"text":"First visit to Cook Out . Love the burgers and seasoned fries. Did not expect a great selection of tasty milk shakes. Will be a top choice for our next road trip ."}
{"text":"I would say the best fast food chain that one needs to try when in NC. The milkshakes are worth a try but the remaining eatable stuff is quiet good"}
{"text":"First time at a Cook Out. Really looking forward to trying a burger and milkshake. Burger was super salty but tasty. Watermelon milkshake was 5 star!! Will try chicken next time."}
{"text":"I went because someone had suggested getting their shakes because they are delicious.   Bad, horrible, terrible choice.   I got a Reese's shake and asked for chocolate ice cream.   Worst experience of my life....chocolate ice cream was vanilla with some chocolate syrup barely mixed in.  The ice cream was super nasty.   I will never go back."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite places to eat. You can get a burger and 2 sides with a drink for $5 which is awesome, plus they are open late."}
{"text":"Just had an awesome,  awesome burger...oh. my. Good. Lord. Yummmmy. Cant wait to go back again!!!! And cheap??? I got a hotdog, burger, hushpuppies and 2 cups of chili for 5 bucks..im not even kidding!! The people working there were super sweet tooo...definitely will be my go to place from now on!!! They accidentally forgot to put my hushpuppies in the bag..i called them..they apologized and gave me not one, but two FREE shakes!!!"}
{"text":"A  TON OF FOOD AT A GREAT PRICE.  This place is awesome.  The people that work in there are tremendous.  Give it a shot.  I love their onion rings."}
{"text":"Cook-Out; the first time I went there I was pleasantly surprised by their hot dog selection, the \"Mexican Style dog\" is really good, and so is the \"Bacon Cheddar dog\". Yesterday,  I went there for lunch with my little brother, andI got the 1/4 pound burger \"Cook-Out Style\", which basically means Carolina style, or for those of you who don't know... that means with chili and coleslaw on top of the cheeseburger.  The burger was OK, personally I think Wendy's \"Carolina Classic\" is better, but it was still good, a little dry and overcooked for me.  However, the fries were some of the best I've ever had, straight up delicious...crispy, with just enough grease, and the skins still on.  True I could have gotten lucky and received the first order of the batch, but hey, I think their fries are amazing.  The onion rings were so-so, not as good as the fries, and a little too ordinary for my taste, too much batter too.  And then the milk shake...ohhlala, fantastic.  My brother ordered the peanut butter- banana shake, and it was perfection in a cup, I mean they greatly exceeded my expectations with this one. The consistency was just right, thick and creamy, with chunks of banana and clumps of peanut butter, ooh the kind of shake you never want to end. Cook-Out Great Shakes, Amazing Fries, and decently cheap prices."}
{"text":"This was our first time here.  The menu was intimidating at first as there are so many items.  The burgers, fries, and onion rings were great!  We both added a chocolate shake as well.  This fast food is much better than the standards.  We will be going again!"}
{"text":"Once again, I am dumbfounded that I have just now been to the Cook Out after living in Charlotte for this long.  Oh my God, this is the best milkshake I have ever had!  My loyalty to Mr. K's has flown out the window with my move across the city because these shakes are out of this world.  There are 30-plus flavors to choose from, they are thick and creamy, and yes, they are certainly spoon worthy.  I usually just take the lid off and eat the chilly yumminess off the straw.  To date (and I've been twice this week!) I've tried the carmel fudge...standard and delicious....and the orange push-up.  The OPU is where its at!  If you liked these little tubes of orange sherbert as a kid, this shake will transport you back to being nine years old in an instant.  Classic!  The burgers are also great....they come in four differet sizes and I think there are also four different topping combos (Carolina style, steak style, etc.)  They also have $.99 hushpuppies, chicken nuggets, and sweet tea....rockin'.  Oh and they're open until 4 am, 5 on the weekends.  Word."}
{"text":"Went thru the drive thur order 2 hot dogs all the way they put just put slaw. A chess buger no chess a nugget no nugget i wont be back and they are slow"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here multiple times a week (he loves it because it's a TON of food and cheap). Every time we come we leave full and satisfied. The service is friendly and quick. I have encountered them losing my order ticket, but as soon as they realized they made it a priority to get my food ready. It's clean and friendly."}
{"text":"Awesome, cheap, clean place to eat!! Food comes in little containers like an actual cookout!! I've liked everything I've had so far!! I'm dying to come back for the Cheerwine float!!! I highly recommend this location!!"}
{"text":"Typical fast food joint with tons of different options to satisfy the inner fast food junkie in you.  The milkshakes here are really good. And you can customize them however you want. Their burgers and fries are not bad either.  Prices are cheap, and they are open late."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I have ever eaten. Great fries. Great service. Lots of toppings. Will come back every time I am in the area. Yum!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty much eh.  Got the tray with a 1/4 hamburger. You have to pick your toppings but they don't give you options on the menu so if you don't tell them anything you get a plain burger. Onion rings were flavorless, hushpuppies were dry, and the fries weren't crispy. Tasted like they've been sitting so they were soggyish.   You have to order outside & there's no place to sit so you have to either sit on the floor or eat in your car"}
{"text":"Absolutely love Cook-Out! At one point it was lunch every day. The food is great and the combos are great for less than $5, including a drink! This one has rarely gotten my order wrong, but I've never paid for something I didn't receive."}
{"text":"Literally have been waiting for 15 minutes for a cheeseburger. There's trash all over the floors and the tables are sticky... will never ever come back... 95/100 health score? My ass!"}
{"text":"Order a quarter pounder with cheese from McDonald's. Gross. Now you kind of hate yourself a little bit and this quarter pounder feels more like a nickel pounder than anything if you're being honest with yourself. Now order a quarter pounder with cheese from Cookout. Good choice. It may not come in a sweet paper bag but underneath that poorly wrapped tinfoil is a juicy, slobbery, burger made with tender love and care. Maybe they forgot the steak sauce, maybe they slam dunked that sucker in grease, but who care's because this burger's so freakin good.  Cookout has, by far, possibly one of the sickest combo trays that five bucks can by on this side of town. With the choice of one entrée, two sides and a drink for just 4-something, it's no wonder this place is always bumpin late at night when all the cool kids are out and about, because let's be honest, only cool kids go to cookout"}
{"text":"I love Cookout. The Milkshakes are AMAZING! The tray combo deal is also great. If you like Hushpuppies you should give them a try here (They are just a $1!)"}
{"text":"Just had the worst milkshake in my life. Supposed to be chocolate mint but had very strong chemical taste ...like cleaning solution...yuck.  I had to ask for a glass of water to get the taste out of my mouth. Then clerk argued with me that it was fine."}
{"text":"So I went here after seeing a movie which ment my options on food after 10pm is limited. so I go and I order 2mexi style dogs with hush puppies , a cheeseburger tray with just cheese add bacon, fries and two fruit punches. I drive up and I see she has sodas poured up another guys come  over and hands me the food and the drinks I tell him I ordered fruit punch and he redo my drinks. I get home and they give me 2 wrong hot dogs and burnt hush puppies and my fries are blah. I go back up there and the guy working the front says well he rung up up (whatever the wrong hot dogs was) I tell him I wanted to Mexi styles he half way snatches but gets my order right"}
{"text":"Went through the drive through for lunch today. Ordered a chicken sandwich tray, fries and a corn dog. Got to the window and paid for my order, was given that receipt and then had my food basically thrown out out the window at me while the cashier was taking someone else's order and I had to pretty much yell to ask for ketchup before he quickly closed the window. I've never felt so rushed in a drive thru. I get it, there's a line, but taking 5 extra seconds to calmly hand me my things and ask if I need anything else isn't going to make a difference.   So after the most stressful drive thru experience ever, I go back to work to discover he gave me the wrong order, the meal I paid for on my receipt was correct but the receipt taped to the box was apparently the person in front of me's judging by the time stamp.  It's cookout, I like cookout, so I figure whatever the wrong order is will still be good since its too late to return it at this point. Wrong, literally everything in the box was of course the only foods I don't like.   I've been to both cookouts in the university area multiple times and have never had an issue. I will never go back to this location."}
{"text":"Drive through person was Incredibly rude. They wouldn't speak up. Then shot me so much attitude I drove off."}
{"text":"I realize Cook Out is a chain, but we don't have them in California and before last week I'd never heard of it, so I thought it worth yelping. For those who don't know, it's a burger place with no indoor seating, similar to Sonic.   I tried their regular cheeseburger and milkshake. The burger came with a 1/8 pound patty, American cheese, lettuce pickles, ketchup, mustard and mayo. So yeah, it's pretty condiment heavy. Once cooked the patty was so small that I couldn't even find it at first. Otherwise, it was a regular crappy fast food burger, pretty similar to McDonalds but not as good.   The milkshake, on the other hand, was great. They have a pretty large selection and I got the Reeces and tried the banana.  My only complaint is that the chocolate pieces were so large they couldn't fit through the straw. Otherwise, it was a great shake."}
{"text":"Great quick service on the drive-through and good value. However, both of our hamburgers tasted like they were cooked extra well done. They were dry and shriveled up like jerky. On the other hand, the corn dog was pretty good. I'm guessing because it was the late night shift (we came at 1am) someone was learning, at our expense. If the burgers are cooked right, however, this place is cheaper and much better than your Mc Donalds and Burger King, etc."}
{"text":"Went here for tonight for my usual tray. I haven't really had problems with them in the past but tonight was not a good experience at all. The girl taking my order at the drive-thru wasn't listening I guess & then made me stop in the middle of ordering to wait for close to 5 minutes. When she was ready to listen to me again, I had to repeat everything I said multiple times - sorry to inconvenience her... Got to the window, where the other worker lady pretty much threw the drinks at me & when I asked for a drink holder since I was getting 2 drinks & 2 milkshakes, she scoffed at me like I did something wrong by asking. Most cars don't have 4 drink holders & my mustang sure doesn't- how am I supposed to hold 4 cups while driving in the car by myself? Got home to find they gave me the wrong quesadilla (chicken instead of the beef that I requested which was not cooked all the way & had to be thrown out) & the wrong milkshake, which leaked all over my car because it wasn't made right! No milkshake melts that fast & it was coming out of the top of the cup when she handed it to me. I thought it was alright but when I pulled it out of the car in the drink tray when I got home, it was all completely melted chocolate liquid mess that stained my seats! It takes me 5 minutes (in a heavily conditioned car) to get home from the restaurant, so no way it just melted on the way home. Also, it did not fall over on my way home but it shouldn't have been a big deal if it did because it shouldn't have been a liquid mess that would immediately leak out the cup drastically. Cookout owes me a car detail to get this mess off my seats! Very disappointed :("}
{"text":"This place  can  and  will  hurt you:), Every time  i  go  to  Charlotte  i  make  bee line  right to  Cook Out! and buy  4 BBQ sandwiches, Knowing  that  is  to  much  for   the  avg  bear. Ok  you get the bbq  plate  -  bbq, 2  sides  and  drink for $4.50 WHAT IN  THE  WORLD.  I wish someone  can  send  me  some overnight to  Tracy  Calif.  Going  back in  less  then  20  days."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Real meat hamburgers. Cheer wine and ice cream great idea."}
{"text":"Consistent food but the late night staff got a bit overwhelmed when I was coming through. My girl got the wrong milkshake and when I brought it up to the lady I got a scoff and an eye roll. After I got the new one the lady didn't say anything to me and just shut the door. It's been a couple months but I haven't gone back"}
{"text":"Make that a tray please!  Any place that has chicken nuggets, chicken quesadillas and corn dogs has a side is a-okay with me!  When I need a really good hamburger quick, Cookout is my go to spot! You can smell that grilled smokey goodness a mile before you get to the actual drive thru. Being that this location is so close to UNC Charlotte it gets pretty crowded on the weekends, so the double drive thru really helps get cars in and out. There's also a walk up window you can order at too. Like most Cookout locations there's no dine in eating area. They've got a couple of seats outside but just take your food and go home and eat.  The menu has a good selection of burgers, hotdogs, BBQ and chicken sandwiches. You can turn any meal into a tray, getting two sides and a drink. As I mentioned earlier these aren't typical sides, goes way above fries...the sides within themselves can be a meal. Want something sweet? They've have several different flavors of milkshake, and I use the term milkshake loosely because it's so thick it's literally ice cream in a cup. Of course they've got the basics like chocolate and vanilla but wait! They've got heath bar, Snickers, Oreo and seasonal flavors such as watermelon and peach.  I wanna give them four stars but they lost one because they've messed up my order more then a few times. So make sure you're checking your food before leaving.  Two thumbs up for this cheap, delicious, and filling meal!"}
{"text":"When Cook Out first opened in the University area, I thought, \"What's that?\"  A co-worker of mine was surprised that I had never heard of it and said we HAVE to go; they're so good.  The catch was that we wanted to get away from work to eat lunch.  So...we had to wait for the perfect day (not too hot, not too cold, and definitely not rainy) to go try it out because Cook Out is strictly a drive-thru with some outdoor seating.  There is NO indoor seating.  We get there and walk up to the window, where there's a large menuboard outside.  My co-worker explained the menu to me: they have combos and you can pick from a list of sandwiches, side, and drink.  So I did.  All for under $5!!  I kept saying, \"And I get all that for under $5? And it's good?\"  Sure enough, he was right.  For \"fast food,\" everything was VERY good.  Much better -- and cheaper! -- than any McDonald's combo.  And the burgers taste like real burgers; not like whatever McDonald's tries to pass off as a burger.    I recommend it for \"on the go\" lunches or dinners.  The food tastes fresher and more \"real\" than fast food restaurants and you can't go wrong with their terrific prices.  I've heard tales of their delicious milkshakes, too, but I'll have to save that for another time.  We ended up going on a chilly day, so I'll save that experience for a warmer day!"}
{"text":"Cool Out = a great dinner for cheap. Is it the healthiest? No. Is it the best bang for your buck and always on point? Yes. If you don't go for a tray then I don't know what you are doing!   Personally I'm not the biggest fan of the French fries. They are the best side deal in the tray because they give you a good amount of them! Always ask for them Cajun style! If you order onion rings they only give you 3 maybe 4 if you're lucky.   Some Cook Outs take an extremely long time to get your food out, but this is fairly efficient. The staff is usually nice and gives you plenty of sauce. Overall if you are hungry, looking for something cheap and fulfilling Cook Out is the place to go."}
{"text":"First off, let recognize what cook out for what it is. A fast food place. The food is good but not out of this world in taste. However, this is what I survived on in college (and still sometimes)! The price is a deal and a cookout tray is the way to go! I'm always satisfied.  Just a few things about the trays..I really like their onion rings and hush puppies but they only give you 3 or 4 so if you are really hungry get the fries. They give you quite a bit. I personally always get a corn dog. So good!   Finally, last word of advice. GET A MILKSHAKE! You can make any combination of flavors that you want for one price. Amazing."}
{"text":"If you're looking for quick, delicious fast food and you're not too worried about your calorie count, Cook Out is the place to go. The menu is a huge selection of typical \"American\" fast food and anything I've tried has been tasty. You absolutely can not beat the value here either. A spicy chicken sandwich with a corndog and hushpuppies? $5. A cheeseburger with fries and chicken nuggets. $5. Sometimes you can even get a meal cheaper if it's the weekly special. Occasionally the hushpuppies will be a little overdone and once or twice they've messed up an order, but the number of times I've visited and had a yummy meal quick is by far the more common occurrence. If you stop by, you should give one of their many super thick milkshakes a try too!"}
{"text":"Maybe I'm spoiled by California's selection of fast food establishments (especially our burgers), but Cook Out didn't really do much for me. They're cheap and fast, but just alright in the quality department. I don't know what this \"cheddar cheese\" of theirs is really made of, but I think \"cheddar\" is a misnomer and I wish I had omitted it from my chilidog. Live and learn, right?  On the milkshake front, I was equally disappointed by the overly sweet, not-enough-banana flavor of my banana cream pie shake. I think that's what I had, anyway. The flavor was mostly nondescript sweetness with a hint of something banana like, so I'm really not entirely sure of what it is I had.  I suppose, in the end, I'm saying that I wouldn't go out of my way to go to a Cook Out location if you're not a local. And especially not if you're from California -- it won't meet the standards you're already used to, neither in quality nor taste. Skip it unless you're out of other options."}
{"text":"Just nasty..... Dry burger, stale fries you can make a better burger and fries at home. I cant believe people love this place. Only reason I would ever come back is for hush puppies and I  can make them my self too. If u go here after 2am your the sketchy one"}
{"text":"I love cook out and this one is clean and friendly. The only thing that could've been better was I accidentally got mayonnaise on my sandwich when I asked for no mayo. Other than that I've never had a bad experience here. Love cook out trays!"}
{"text":"The quality just isn't there. It was my first time. The nuggets were like sponges. One bite and I threw them away. The fries tasted like chemicals and the burger was poor quality beef with bone chunks mixed in. Never going here again."}
{"text":"Recommended by Phil  You get what you pay for. If you're looking for quick cheap food this is great and tastes better than Mcdonald's.   This rating is for fast food  Hamburger 4 Spicy chicken 4 Corn dog 3. Tastes good but small  Shake 5 lots of mix ins good ice cream"}
{"text":"I CookOut and you can't go wrong with their chopped BBQ tray's which are A real bargain for five bucks. Their onion rings are YUMMY as well & I've never had a burger here. It's nice that they are open at 2am and really really late on weekends because when everything else is shut down you can always count on CookOut! Just one complaint: I do not think it's cool that they Play the music or Muzak that they do in a restaurant! Guests dining in have to listen to Christian radio and that's not cool though I am a Christian I don't ever want to offend or demand that anyone who might not be... It's not inclusive nor is it respectful to our Jewish, bloodiest, or Muslim counterparts. As one who's traveled extensively it was incredibly intrusive and offensive When I was in Indonesia and the call to prayer several times a day was blasted out of her loudspeakers for 20 minutes... Couldn't get away from it & it was tough to listen to when you don't know the language esp...anyway they need to change their music. It has no place in a fast food joint."}
{"text":"Best. Milkshake. Ever.   I decided that after a long day at work I wanted a treat....no correction...I deserved a treat for making it through the workday...lol...so I stopped at Cook Out for a chocolate milkshake and some onion rings...   When I saw the milkshake...my mouth watered and then I tasted it and...OH MY GOODNESS....delicious!!! Creamy, thick and super delicious taste...it was perfect!   The onion rings were hot, just made to order...and I was in heaven! Crispy and hot...just like I like them!!!  I'm truly a new fan of Cook Out and I'll be back for my milkshake fix...very soon!"}
{"text":"Usually, we get hotdogs and burgers from here, but I was so pleasantly surprised, tonight, with dindin  from Cookout!    The BBQ was awesome! It was a generous portion of moist, tasty Q on a nice warm bun (that wasn't soggy!) with just enough slaw and Texas Pete. The fries were unusually good, as well- hot, crispy and well seasoned. Even the tea was nice and fresh at that late hour. Lastly, the service was quick and friendly, as always."}
{"text":"Burgers are good but I like those other 5 guys burgers instead oh and I guess if your not from around here don't even think about going thru the drive thru it's like the biggest most unreadable confusing hurried crazy thing ever if I ever go again hell with drive thru until I've lived here for at least 5 maybe 10 years and can be a veteran drive thru person I'm walking in it's like if I mix up all the letters in this review and give you 1 minute to read it and figure it out then you gotta move on."}
{"text":"Can't beat the speed, price, taste, options, etc.  I wish this chain was up in Michigan."}
{"text":"If you don't like Cook Out then we just can't be friends. Who gives you 10k calories on a platter for $5 and the privilege of hearing you get fatter as you take the bag?"}
{"text":"Good burger for a very good price. The meal trays come with your choice of three items I.e burger, nuggets and fries but there is a wide selection. The hushpuppies are a little hard so I would stay away but everything else is made to order. To top it off you can order a shake for $1.00 more when ordering a meal tray. They have a wide selection of great shakes. My boys love this place and I do too!"}
{"text":"I'm new to the whole Cookout craze. And honestly I still need to find a \"favorite\" menu item...But I do know that I like their onion rings!   But for this review all I care about are the milkshakes...my goodness!   Those things are deeeeelish! They are reasonably priced, thick and creamy and I'd be remiss not mention that they have MORE than enough flavor choices to please anyone's taste buds.   Do yourself a favor and get one soon! You can thank me later, for the awesome party your mouth is sure to experience!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome!  It was a beautiful day and we stopped by.  We split a foot long dog with all the fixings and a basic burger.  Although I live in Ohio where we have a ton of awesome burger joints we loved this place.  I got a coke float and hubs got a cheer wine float.  He is a cheer wine addict.  It was so good thAt I think if they put one up here I would be a regular."}
{"text":"While I love me some Cook-Out, the service here is hit and miss. Yesterday, for example, I was getting two Trays for me and my dad and the girl on the mic was a bit monotone and acted as if she did not want to be at work. The food is always good and I mostly get hush puppies if I don't get anything else."}
{"text":"Cookout has great burgers, an incredible variety of shakes, and about the best side combinations you can get. The folks at this location are friendly, quick... and they know how to take care of putting together burgers for a hungry guest!   I'll also add the burgers are tastier/fresher than some fast food places I've tried out there.   I'm glad Cookout is always nearby in North Carolina."}
{"text":"The only time one can truly appreciate all that Cook Out has to offer is between the hours of 10pm - 2am. This is when they are in full force and all of the good people watching happens.   We have seen it all at this Cook Out and all different types of people come here. There is a hotel next door, and it runs along a busy South Tryon, so you will never know who you are going to meet at the walkup window.   Also if you are at the walkup window, be prepared to wait. They will serve everyone in the drive thru line first because those are timed and you are not.   We have never gotten bad food from this location. It is always hot and fresh."}
{"text":"Food is subpar with minimal employee training. It's reflected in the food, the food is cheap but don't expect much!"}
{"text":"One of the nicest Cook Outs I've been to, this one in Matthews off 74 has a place to eat inside.   One very important note: They have Quesadillas. That might sound silly, but if you've grown to love them at Cook Out, some don't carry it (cough Huntersville cough).   The place was clean, and as always they provided great Cookout food, fast."}
{"text":"Not a great experience at this location - food was tasteless - over cooked - seemed like it was microwaved - service was rushed and for no reason as there was not a line of cars or people.   Outside the picnic tables were dirty"}
{"text":"Went to cook out tonite and ordered 2 trays both with double bacon burgers. My double bacon burger had more than bacon and the usual toppings it had a huge piece of charcoal on the burger. I bit down on the burger and noticed something hard after spitting it out this is what I found ...."}
{"text":"I've never used the walk up window so this is from a drive thru only perspective.   The bbq can sort of be a too spicy mush that you don't get sauce for, so generally speaking I pass on their bbq.  Their burgers are okay but I usually like bacon on my burgers and their bacon while light years ahead of mcdonalds or bk is still undercooked and very pink so I pass on the burgers too.  I only had their chili cheese fries a few times because I prefer REAL cheese (shredded, not Velveeta ejaculate).  I get their quesadillas in a cook out tray, I order them plain cheese without the (very spicy for my tastes) queso sauce. Sometimes they get this right.   The order accuracy is pretty hit or miss and seems to be independent of if they're busy or not.   The shakes are pretty good and their sweet tea is the best!   The only true gripe I have with this place is they no longer use bags, so if you have a order for more than one person or need condiments it gets tricky to carry all that in one go.  And because they no longer use bags to give your food to you, you'll never get a condiment unless you ask for it."}
{"text":"Food was just as I remembered it! Came down for my Husband's birthday weekend and stopped here for something fast and cheap. Not bad at all!"}
{"text":"Good food and pretty fast.  BUT, it's run by kids who don't give a hoot about hygiene. Saw employees wipe their noses and their faces, saw an employee arrive to work and promptly vomit in the parking lot before going to work, and don't get me started on the FLOORS. I bet the floors have not been cleaned in over a year. It's just disgusting. And if the dining room is so disgusting, it tells you a lot about the kitchen."}
{"text":"This location always seems to have a lineup at the drive thru windows (both of them). I've been here a handful of times, and only one of them resulted in an incorrect order.   This last trip though, I feel like the sides got a little smaller on the cook out tray. I swear a side of nuggets used to be 4, but on my last visit there was only 3. Alas, I'll still keep going back for that glorious monstrosity known as the cook out tray. If you've never had cookout, I definitely recommend the Cajun chicken sandwich and the peanut butter fudge milkshake.   $4.99 for a main item with 2 sides & a drink is a hard deal to resist. Damn you, Cook Out."}
{"text":"I always get the chicken sandwich, but recently tried a cheeseburger here. The cheeseburgers are pretty tasty. I was pleasntly surprised. The service is quick and is what you would expect from most  Cook Outs. The prices are on par for what you get. I have yet to try the shakes."}
{"text":"I had the worst time here last night. I had the worst service and a rude drive-thru lady. All I asked at the window was for her to repeat my order and she rolled her eyes and just ripped the receipt off the bag an told me to read it myself and closed her window. I've had way better experiences at other cook out, last time I'm going her.   Then she forgot two of my orders."}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE HAVING A BIG MAC ATTACK. Anyway, i love this place but i wish they had outdoor seating like picnic tables. I agree with David O. there's a lady there that yells \"banana nut\" like she's moaning sexually and \"tray queso\" too. She makes me giggle and laugh my ass off. I love her"}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars. Our order is always correct. The value of the tray is great. I prefer the bbq sandwich tray with fries and hush puppies. Speaking of hush puppies - I'm picky about them. However these are very good and a great portion size if you get an order. I enjoy their slaw - another thing I'm picky about."}
{"text":"I went to Cookout when I was in North Carolina, and stopped by after seeing a sign on the road (and then checking Yelp to see if it was any good). Yelp had great reviews, so I went ahead and tried it and I'm glad I did. The burgers are made fresh and they have a huge variety of shakes. They offer two sides, so I got both the hushpuppies along with the french fries, and the hushpuppies were such a treat - they were small, which was nice. I also got a tasty chocolate shake. Best thing of all, my total was like $6 for a fresh grilled burger, fries, hush puppies and a shake? Can't beat that with a baseball bat!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for milkshakes! I'm both happy and worried they opened a location on the south side of town. I love their food and shakes, but my waistline may not..."}
{"text":"We were there at 7:30pm today and ordered a hotdog platter. Asked if we could just have 1 hotdog instead of two. The young girl goes No we only sale 2 hotdogs in the platter. I told her she only wanted 1. She said she only had to eat 1! I said ok just give us the platter and extra Oder of fries. She told me the total, I drove up gave her the card. She hands me the tea then a Togo box. I asked her where was the other hotdog and fries. She asked for 1.89 for the second hotdog! I told her she already charged me for the second hotdog! She said but I only charged me for 1 cook out style, which is only 95 cents more! That doesn't come to 1.89! My friend said just take it back and give me my money back! She gave us cash back and we left with no food! I will never go back there! First to tell me she could throw the second hotdog away instead of only charging for 1 and to over charge for the 1 hotdog cook out style. Bad business people!!!!"}
{"text":"what can i say this place has some of the best burger's i have ever tasted.  i love the fries and strawberry shakes.  if ever in Carolina don't leave until you try them."}
{"text":"The food and shakes were very good. There were employees, I guess on break, hanging out around the order window goofing off with the girls at the window. Of course our order was not correct and we had to go back and wait for them to get it right."}
{"text":"Having spent some time in past in N.C. it was awesome coming back to something familiar. For what you pay you get a lot of value and something that's delicious. However, definitely not the healthiest thing around by any means but I think one knows that coming here. Love the peanut butter banana shake and the spicy chicken sandwich here!"}
{"text":"The service has been inconsistent but mostly bad. Orders have wrong but have been hoping they turn it around. Instead it has not and food quality has decreased. I ordered food for five people and 4 of them want honey mustard source. First I had to ask for it then when I ask for it I got only 2 so I said can I have 2 more and she then hands me 1 more. I'm not sure what is going on but not a very enjoyable service."}
{"text":"Once my friend and I got into a debate about burgers, he was adament about Cook Out, I tried it and it was not good.  We had a bet but we never actually had the official burger showdown.  The other day I was craving a chocolate milkshake so I whipped into Cook Out and it was clean, they were friendly, newly remodeled and my milkshake was delish.    So, today, I thought well, maybe I should give this Cook Out another chance, small burger, Cook Out style, chili, mustard, slaw and onion. Regular fry and a small drink. Four dolla, no holla.  That's pretty awesome.  I sit outside, sweet tea good, my burger good.  What I really liked about my burger was the steamed bun, reminded me of a beach hamburger wrapped in wax paper. But, you know, the most important Tonya question....  French Fry Barometer: Caliente! All and all, Cook Out was pretty decent. So, should I tell my friend about my adventure today? Nahhhh."}
{"text":"Cook Out can always be hit or miss for me.  Tonight I was craving a \"cookout style\" hamburger & I wheeled on into this Cook Out.  I pulled in & thankfully there wasn't any wait in either drive-thru. Woo hoo! I was pleasantly greeted on the speaker by a gentleman asking for my order. I get the SAME thing every time, I'm so predictable! Regular tray: cookout style (slaw, onions, & chili), seasoned fries, corn dog & cheerwine. I was thanked for my order & when I pulled up, in no time I had my food. I was so hungry, I decided to partake in my food while driving. Normally, this is where I have an issue...but not today!  The fries were neatly placed inside the tray, light on the seasoning (so it wasn't spilling all over the place).  I uncovered the foil on the hamburger & surprised again; the hamburger was actually neat! The slaw & chili stayed on the hamburger & didn't spill out into the foil.  I was two for three so far!  And the corn dog...perfect temperature & wasn't overcooked. The cheerwine was  perfect, too. Three cheers all around for Cook Out!   The parking lot was clean, there was plenty of parking & it was easy to get in & out of the location.  Pleasant employees, terrific experience & tasty food. Way to go, Cook Out!"}
{"text":"I like the 'ol Cook Out.  I have cut down significantly on my fast food intake, but once in a while I crave Cook Out's 'Carolina style' hamburger tray with a corn dog & seasoned fries as my sides.  This location never disappoints...from the sweet kid who takes my order over the speaker, to the nice kid who serves my meal.  I say \"kids\", because every time I go there it's teenagers working. ;) I have no complaints about the service or the meal itself.  Hamburger is fully cooked, fries are always hot & not \"over-seasoned\" & my corn dog is fried to perfection. YAY Cook Out!"}
{"text":"Food is great! They could really use some outside seating areas like the one near concord mills! There is this one employee that talks weird and she says banana nut very sexually and it really freaks me out every time I go and encounter her We always make awkward eye contact and I run away!"}
{"text":"So here's the deal: the employees are significantly more competent here than at most Cook Outs but there is a 75% chance that there will be a big group of college kids in front of you who can't decide what they want.   It is in the same parking lot as the Saucer however, so if beer gives you the munchies for something greasy (isn't that the natural human reaction?) you are in luck. And if you're feeling to lazy to get out of your car I'm sure you'll appreciate the double drive thru.  In short, go to Cook Out. Heck, go to this Cook Out. And for pete's sake, get some hush puppies and a shake."}
{"text":"There is a lot of construction in the university area near this cookout location. So getting in and out from Tryon St. is frustrating! This location can be very busy at times but having two order lanes helps to speed things up a bit. The milkshakes are always great but the $4.99 combo items are \"hit or miss\". Sometimes it's really good and other times it's disappointing. In other words consistency is a problem. The one thing that's pretty consistent is the friendly service. Never had an issue with the staff."}
{"text":"42 minutes to get through 4 cars in the drive thru....  I don't have high hopes when I get fast food, but this was just awful. I could have gone down the street and sat down to eat, and been done before I received my half order of fries, burger covered in mayo after saying no mayo, 4 chicken nuggets rather than 5, and a soda with zero carbonation at all.   The burger was extremely dry like it was cooked hours before. It was slathered in mayo even with me asking for no mayo. The grilled onions on it could not have been grilled more than a minute because they were raw.   The chicken nuggets, however, may be the worst ones I've ever had. They are dry and spongy and taste like the equivalent of the ones you would get in a school cafeteria. They are not even worth the $1 I spent on them.  The staff could not care less. No apologies for the wait times and abrupt in their interactions.   If you are going to wait 45 minutes on food, there are tons of better options in the area."}
{"text":"This is the second worse place I've eaten. My son ordered a \"cheese dog\". Now, when I say \"cheese dog\" you would think they were talking about a hot dog with cheese. NOT. Their version of a cheese dog is a hot dog bun with American cheese and toppings....NO HOT DOG. I asked them why do you call it a cheese dog...it should be called a cheese bun. Furthermore, it is a drive-thru only (well the location we went to). Day-um."}
{"text":"Maybe I was just blessed with an amazing cookout back in college, but whenever I come here I'm always disappointed. They seldom put quesadilla sauce in their chicken quesadilla, the onion rings were stale, once I asked for Cajun fries, but when I went back (because they gave me regular) they just threw some seasoning on my fries and hand my tray back to me. Also, I'm not sure they make peanut butter fudge milkshakes like other cookouts do because usually there is chocolate fudge in it...except when I get one from here."}
{"text":"They need to do something about the kids with the big trucks that likes to drive 100 miles in their parking lot. I dont know if I need to order a milk shake or run for my life?"}
{"text":"It's late, you're drunk, nothing's open you're probably hungry.   The menu is self explanatory. Nothing is organic, but it gets the job done. Good greasy food after a long night out. No matter what you order you'll enjoy it. I always get the chicken strip tray. I don't like milkshakes but I heard they're good.   Just do it."}
{"text":"We heard about this place so decided to go. I got the BBQ pork sandwich. We also split orders of hushpuppies, onion rings and fries. The sandwich was a joke! I unwrapped it and put it on my plate it looked like it was just an empty bun. I looked inside and there was maybe a tablespoon of meat inside. The bun was soggy too. The onion rings had a strange aftertaste. I did like the hushpuppies, but that's about it. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"The BBQ sandwiches here are pure heaven. Pulled pork with coleslaw and topped with Texas Pete...yum,yum! Very friendly atmosphere. I try to go at least twice a month. It's my go to spot."}
{"text":"My sister got me interested in Cook Out.  One night while waiting to see an advanced screening movie, she brought us a Bar-be-cue sandwich and hushpuppies from Cook Out.  Yum, yum!!  The sandwich was really good and the huspuppies.. WOW... they had onions in them. Their slaw was good too.  Love Cook Out for the barbecue and hushpuppies!!  I'm not sure if they make them or are sent in or buy from a \"company\", but I intend to find out.  I have been back several times since."}
{"text":"Always friendly and fast when we go, even during peak hours when it takes forever to get down Bruton Smith. Only downside - they skimp on the fries portions. All other cookout locations give way more fries."}
{"text":"Yum! There's no cookout where I'm from. When we travel south this is what my kids want most of all"}
{"text":"Went the opposite way from my hotel just to try this place out and really enjoyed it!  I got out of a work meeting early and took some the locals advice and got me a shake.  Banana Fudge to be exact, and it was delicious!  Real bananas in there!  If ever in the Carolinas again... I will look for the cook out and order a burger too!"}
{"text":"Wasn't greeted upon approaching the register.   Ordered a cookout tray with a burger, fries and corn dog. I literally waited 10 minutes to receive my food. An absolute joke. Fries were decent along with corndog. Burger was completely cold. So far this location keeps getting worse and worse as the days go on. It used to be good at first. Next time this happens I'll be taking the entire tray back and ask for it to be remade. It gets tired of being served subpar food when you wait over 5 minutes."}
{"text":"I stopped by hoping to get a quick late night milkshake, but I was wrong. At first I attempted to go in the drive thru, but after sitting in the same spot for 5 minutes, I figured I'd get the exercise and walk inside. My order was taken quickly and I decided to grab a seat. After realizing I was waiting 20 minutes for a milkshake, I just had to ask for my money back. I was caught off guard and annoyed when the little girl at the register informed me that she made my milkshake a while back and they are just sitting in the cooler. If you made it, why didn't you just hand it to me?! I just feel management needs to have a talk with their employees, because the issues I had could have been easily avoided if some of the workers weren't so easily distracted by socializing with their classmates. I guess if I need a quick milkshake from now on, I'll just go to a different Cook-Out....or Chick-Fil-A."}
{"text":"This place was extremely nasty inside. Every table was sticky or covered in food, the drawer of sweet and low by the drink machine was filled with soggy packets. No dry ones at all. The hush puppies we're yummy but the food made both me and my boyfriend sick. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Food was very good, but worst staff. the staff was hanging with their friends while i was waiting in a queue..."}
{"text":"What can I say? Fresh, affordable, and tasty.  Especially if u get the BIG Double ($3.99 with drink) or BBQ Plate ($3.99 no drink) Many options for kids."}
{"text":"After being blown away by other Cook Out locations, my family and I made the mistake of visiting the one on Sardis. Store was clean, but the service was very slack. The shakes were all poorly made, and the resulting taste was a reflection of pure laziness and apathy. While Concord Mills and Indian Trail Cook Out may be on game, I would suggest gas station hot dogs over this place. Don't waste your time, money and calories here."}
{"text":"The good was hot, and fresh when orded, And the quality  of the food was great Great customer sarvice"}
{"text":"I loved cookout up until my daughter got food poisoning from eating a burger here the Thursday before Super Bowl 2014. Service is decent at this location, but the line is usually long and moves entirely too slow. I will not be returning to this location for a while."}
{"text":"Not what I expected. The burgers are small and not that tasty. The hush puppies are good."}
{"text":"This has got to be the worst cookout ever.... the staff is completely incompetent.... I have visited this cookout several times and each time my order is completely wrong... I give up with this restaurant"}
{"text":"This is my second visit to this cookout which is right across from the hospital. My aunt ordered her burger without mustard and received it otherwise, they quickly fixed the mistake and even brought the food to our table, excellent job. This is also the first one I been to with an actually dine-in area and outside seating. Typical cookout nothing really different except that; 40+ milkshakes, burgers and hotdogs!"}
{"text":"Fast food at its finest ... well okay now - hold on .... let's just say it's fast and it's food - but it's burgers and shakes and corn dogs and chicken sandwiches and such.   They boast 40 plus different flavors of milk shakes available. So there's that!   It's a great little place to eat cause for a few bucks where else can you get corn dogs as a side ? Their value tray is the deal. A burger and fries and a couple sides ...  Try it ! You'll be amazed how much food you can get for a few bucks !"}
{"text":"This used to be a favorite. Who could beat $5 and change for a full meal? Now it's $5+ for a meal. Price went up and quality went down. Sadly I'm not sure if I want to return after this visit.   Well, I returned 2 weeks later. The guy at the window didn't listen and was rude. I was afraid I was going to end up with something I don't like. My husband has had oral surgery and his teeth are very sensitive. He requested no ice and still had ice. Also, we've gotten the same meal both times and it was 2 different prices. I am pretty sure I'm done with this location."}
{"text":"I normally don't review fast food places but Cookout will be an exception.  Yes, the line was long, yes they got my my order wrong. What I think a Big Double is and what I got are in two different worlds. The burgers were bland and tasteless. They were dry like the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah. The fries were greasy with a side of grease.   I didn't receive any napkins or condiments and yes it's upsetting when you get ready to eat and have nothing to wipe your hands with. So I thank you Cookout for the terrible service, for now I know to spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"I've always used the drive thru. Though, you can eat inside. He drive thru staff is friendly and don't rush you for an order . The burgers are awesome and so are the hush puppies.   The hotdogs are pretty good too.   I usually get Cookout style for hot dogs.  Cookout: Mustard, onion, slaw, chili   I get the Steak style for burgers.  Steak: A-1 sauce, tomato, lettuce, grilled onion   Oh, and they have over 40 milkshake flavors..  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Used to come here all the time when I lived in North Carolina! Living in Texas now, this Cook Out is one of the places I miss most about leaving! Best sandwiches and shakes! NEVER CHANGE COOK OUT YOURE THE G O A T!"}
{"text":"Tasty fries. Very bad cheeseburger. Claimed to be charbroiled, no charbroil flavor at all, no char marks on meat.  Meat had a livery, gamey flavor, and was dry. Took two bites and threw it out."}
{"text":"For the money...... Im not sure you get a better deal at a burger spot. This is my daughter's choice for burgers now. And yes, for those of us with more developed taste buds, there are more tasty burgers out there. But again, for the value, I'm cool with it. They are normally pretty fast with the food and I have not had a mistake yet.  I like the fries, but I have to get the special seasoning on them. But the real reason I like this spot is because I love the milkshakes. The oreo shake is my fave, because I eat it with a spoon and treat it like a cup of cookies and cream ice cream instead of a shake. Hey, thats just how I roll."}
{"text":"Ordered there BBQ tray today it was ok made very messy slaw was all over sandwich. Onion rings were good  very slow today but it was lunch hr. There tea is always good with that crushed ice they have."}
{"text":"Because I can't give \"0\" stars... You get better burgers in a box at the dollar store....you can bet I'm never going there again... They were rude, didn't even inquire if you wanted anything on your burger, absolutely the worst!!!"}
{"text":"One if my favorite go to spots for a quick bite. Expect lots of grease and protein! The shakes here are really good too. I recommend the banana shake. Overall good value."}
{"text":"This is only a drive threw location. There are no inside seats , it's weird that the place is so big and there is no way to go inside and sit down and eat your meal"}
{"text":"Bruh every time I ask for ketchup they give me like two packets. What am I supposed to do with two packets when I have like a gazillion fries? Work on that. But other than that great place."}
{"text":"Always check your money, that have a habit of shorting you. The rude kid tried to short me 5 dollars and then he said i must have lost it but he swore he gave it too me.  Someone came and gave me my missing 5 dollars.  My brother who is a manager at a cookout said they should have broken the register down.   I'm never coming back to this cookout again"}
{"text":"Cookouts motto should be you get a corn dog and another side.  I swear all everyone orders is a damn corn dog on their tray and so do I.  THis cookout is fast and makes the food the same as any other cookout.  Now to be a 5 star cookout, you need quesadillas.  This cookout is lacking in the sides department, but other than that, just a standard cookout."}
{"text":"Come for shakes...stay for the grease. Seriously...the food is ok but WAY too greasy! Ironic name since their best items are the milkshakes that are thick and full of your requested add-ins. Great for a hot summer day."}
{"text":"They have great tasting food for a reasonable price.  I've only been through the drive thru lanes (there's two if them FYI) and it has always been fast service, and they haven't messed up my order yet.  Great milkshake selection, I recommend the Oreo flavor.  Prolly one of the best cook outs I've been to."}
{"text":"This place is so awesome.  I hope you have one near you.  So many milk shakes and really really good burgers.  You put some strange combos together here and for cheap.  There is a fan site other than the one listed on this page that has a huge list of all their locations.  http://eatcookout.com"}
{"text":"Worst cook out!!! Order is wrong every time! I alway have to go back. I've had to simplify my order because I know other wise it will be wrong. I truly don't understand how they are trying to pass this Cook Out Special Sauce as Quasa Sauce. It is no where close to the same. If I ask for extra sauce on my quesadilla I expect to get it. Not some nasty special sauce that taste that zaxbys sauce."}
{"text":"In the realm of fast food, there can be only one ruler. Thr Ruler is of course, Chick-fil-a (in my humble opinion) ... and the next in line to the throne would be Sir Von Cookout, Duke of Milk Shakes and Sloppy Burgers. Cookout beats out the more well known establishments like Burger Queen, and McDowells (extra points if you can guess the movie reference) because it has that homey, family reunion type taste. The burgers aren't fancy but they come pretty well dressed. It reminds me of In & Out on the West Coast. Their grub is pretty solid and the menu is well rounded for a burger drive-thru joint. I tried two types of burgers and a pulled pork sandwich ... and a shake. Bill was less than $10 and my arteries didn't even clog that much. So the value is on par if not better than the competition. Less we forget the real reason why everyone flocks to or should flock to Cookout .. The Milk Shakes. The 50 million types of milkshakes. Seriously there's probably too many milk shakes on the menu. The cookies and cream milk shake was pretty good and kind of tasted like a McFlurry. It was think and kind of hard to suck from a stray. #pause. All and all, I'd suggest that you at least try Cookout once in your life - for the food. Then 13 times for milk shakes. Bon appetite."}
{"text":"First time at this location. Like that you can go inside or sit outside. Ordered the $4.99 combo in which we received in a timely manner. My only complaint was the ladies restroom. It needed a little more attention. Other than that, had a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"This restaurant was fabulous! Great deals! I loved there burgers!   Food  The food was delicious and there smoothies were delicious as well. (Smoothies 1$) (food 4.99)  The restaurant didn't have a good dining section so it's technically a drive through and eat in the car. They have benches but no table."}
{"text":"You guys.  I love Cook Out.  This is the only location I've been to so I can't really compare it to other ones and this review is more for the whole chain than this particular place.    Ridiculously cheap for a whole meal's worth of food that tastes like real food, not like processed mush that has been sitting under a heat lamp for hours!  Fresh hush puppies, freshly grilled chicken breast which is obviously chicken, customize everything as you like it.  And the milkshakes!  Loved the pineapple and peach ones, lots of flavor and a good thick texture.  A comparable thing in SoCal would be Habit, which will set you back about twice as much (maybe a little more if you get the shake).    Also, if you're curious, there's free wifi!"}
{"text":"\"Can I have a Cookout Chzburger on ur way home?\" is the text message I received from my wife, who dislikes fast food but loves Cook-Out. She's very picky but loves the flavor... reminiscent of the summer time cook outs in the backyard growing up... dad on the grill sweatin' and cussin', mom in the kitchen preparing the potato salad and entertaining guests, Uncle George drinking way too much and throwing up on the next door  neighbor's kid.... Good times.  Good cheap food, quick & on the fly... Tasty burgers, dogs, chicken, fries, and o-rings but haven't tried the BBQ yet.  Something like 40 varieties of milkshakes & a few seasonal flavors as well (like egg nog in winter & watermelon in summer)  Most Cook-Outs are simply drive-thru only, but this location has a dining room. I think the dining room is open until 10pm and the drive thru is open until like 2am. The only bad thing I can say about Cook-Out is that their menu is sketchier than Chinese arithmetic. No flow or continuity... just looks like Carl Childers from Slingblade was in charge of this layout. The term 'hot mess' is applicable.  Overall, a solid place to pick up some pretty good & cheap eats... and are open late for those late night appetites. Try 'em out sometime."}
{"text":"Had a bug in my banana pudding shake and other brown and black things. I told management and they said sorry and wanted to know if I wanted another one. I think not...I want my money back. I bet they didn't even clean the machine after I showed them them what was coming from it. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"My first time flying solo at Cook Out, I usually end up here because my Wife and Daughter want lunch here. Today, it was out of convenience, I needed a quick lunch but didn't want nearby Bojangles. I ordered the Spicy Chicken sandwich combo, with Cajun Chicken wrap and onion rings. The girl behind the counter was friendly, and the food was served quickly and hot. I liked the sandwich, liked the wrap even more, the onion rings were meh. The crushed ice for my Diet Coke was a nice change. Can't beat it for a $5 lunch."}
{"text":"One of the best fast food restaurants that North Carolina has to offer! If you are a first timer the menu can be a bit overwhelming but just pick anything and I'm pretty sure you'll be happy.    The shakes are amazing and come in hundred of combinations! This location is fast and the people who work are generally friendly. The only draw back is it being so close to a college campus and how bratty this location gets after midnight."}
{"text":"Great burgers and shakes.  Too many flavors of milk shake so be prepared to study the list of concoctions.  Little hamburgers at 1/8 ounce up to a real burger at 8 ounces.  Two other sizes in between.  Also hot dogs served with chile, gobs of oozy gooey nacho cheese and more.  Comfort food extraordinary.  Yes, this is not the place for diet, although you can get unsweet tea and diet sodas.  Enjoy.   Religious music in the background and Biblical references on the foam cups."}
{"text":"My husband and I go there because the food is good which is the only reason I give it one stars but this location slacks! I'm always missing something and having to go back. Not once have they gave me everything I order or they mess up my husbands Texas cheese and chili fries. The staff always looks like dandruff is all over them and they make you wait forever just to take your order if you order from the walk up window outside. I don't recommend ever going to this location."}
{"text":"Every Time I have been to this store they have gotten my order WRONG!!!!   Customer service SUCKS!!!  Walked back in to get order fixes & the workers just stared at me like I had ten heads!!!!!  No one knows what the heck they are doing!!!!   Get it together Cook Out!!!!!"}
{"text":"Cheap food. Check.  Tons of milkshakes. Check.  Standard service. Check.  Cook Out. Check."}
{"text":"Love this spot. Kool place to grab a bite to eat on the run and for a good value. You can choose to eat inside or out! Even has a walk up window. I rather eat at this one vs the others."}
{"text":"Got myself a watermelon milkshake and an A-1 style burger. So many options and open a lot later than everything else in the area!"}
{"text":"Came here for a large order of chili cheese fries NOT cheese fries. And they slapped maybe a spoon of cheese and just sent it out.   Do these bitches know how to take food orders? If they cant handle a simple order I'm pretty sure none of them can go to college... get your shit together."}
{"text":"You know I visit this Cookout quite often at least twice or more a week and I'm just not impressed.  They have only one drive thru line and are quick to toss your food out the window with little to no regard for order accuracy.  I have gotten into the habit of checking my orders before I leave the window here.  So the majority of the star rating here is on speed of service but quality and hospitality need major improvements.  This location has a dining room as well but it just replaces a normal Cookouts' walk-up window.  They do not really keep things clean and there is always sticky residue from drinks and sweet tea at the drink stations inside.  The last time I went my BBQ sandwich wasn't too hot telling me it hasn't spent long enough cooking on the char grill.  On multiple occasions they run out of sweet tea on the inside and when customers tell employees about it they have a bit of an attitude.  If this was my cookout we would have to tighten some things up.   Sweep your floor people and clean up the mess it makes us wonder about your sanitation."}
{"text":"For you George!!  Exquisite milkshakes, vast selection, apparently stay away from the pork!"}
{"text":"First time I went through the drive-thru the lady talked so fast she didn't even get my order right.  The second day that I went to the drive-thru I sat for 5 minutes waiting for someone to answer me. So I looked up their number on my phone quick and called and they said \"oh we're sorry, our audio system is down\". Wouldn't you think to put a sign on the menu to just pull forward?  Also, disgusting inside."}
{"text":"So I went to cookout last night and ordered onion rings..so when i bit into one of them I tasted the grit of powder in my mouth..so I opened the ring up and it was full of powdery flour or some sort..there's no number for the store..."}
{"text":"Ordered a cookout tray and never got my corn dog and they filled my drink to the top with ice. What a rip off. The corn dog was what I was looking forward to the most and they ruined it."}
{"text":"This review is only for the shakes, of which there are MANY flavors to choose from. With $.99 specials, prices are amazing! We went for a $2.50 toffee heath bar crunch on a splurge. The shake is more like a DQ Blizzard in consistency (very thick), almost like soft ice cream. It didn't last long enough to use the provided straw, just the spoon."}
{"text":"Horrible! The worst cookout I've ever been to. Just sloppy and ghetto. I see a girl use the broom to sweep the floor, didn't wash her hands and then make a sandwich. Just gross. The health inspector needs to come and shut that place down. My food was burnt. Just threw my food together and handed it to me through the window. No condiments or anything. I don't usually leave a feedback of just 1 but this is the truth.   Do not go to this location. Completely gross and nasty."}
{"text":"I try to get my friends to mail me the shakes, or at least bring them with them when they fly out to see me. When I was living in Charlotte, there was no way I could drive past Cook Out without stopping. And it's super cheap!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food (chicken strips are awesome, juicy white meat and a very crispy crust), and cheap, a \"Cook Out Tray\" with beverage is less than $5.  Every worker I have encountered has been very polite and respectful, a rarity these days in the fast food world.  This is the only fast food chain I patronize."}
{"text":"The food here SUCKS.  Management are a bunch of jerks.  They could care less about your complaints.  Avoid this store!!!"}
{"text":"Their milkshake selection is crazy. Go here only for the milkshakes(especially the peanut butter fudge one).  That being said, the cajun fries are OK, the hush puppies are unimpressive, and the Cook Out style burger is a typical fast food burger. Its a little better than steak & shake but that isn't a tall order.  See if they can give you a spoon with your milkshake unless you have the soft palate muscle strength to suck a golf ball through a garden hose*. It is very thick.  *from Full Metal Jacket."}
{"text":"Best fast food place to eat. Had the chargrilled burger, fries,  onion rings corn on a cob, it was all delicious! Was surprise at first bht they exceed my expectations.  Will definately recommend this if you are looking for a fast bite ."}
{"text":"Food is always fantastic! They get shifty on the portions sometimes but it's still good...service...well you gotta catch the good ones there's a few eggs that are rotten."}
{"text":"2am...I'm tired...the summer humidity is overworking my sweat glands and my soul. I'm hungry and still tired. The hospital cafeteria has long closed as have most of the local food eateries. The emergency room is still with the sterile \"beeps\" of life giving (but mind numbingly annoying) machines and I have another 5 hours until my shift ends. A nurse recommends Cook Out for a late night food stop. I take her recommendation dimly but optimistically. My arrival to the drive through brings me to a billboard sized menu. Its bright lights blind me as I stare to have my eyes adjust. Even through the thick evening humidity I can smell the unmistakable scent of grease, meat, and idle car emissions. I chose a standard burger combo with the un-standard sides of corn bread and chicken nuggets.   My entire consumption was in some what of a daze. It was either the sweltering heat or the burgers charred grease that was causing me to perspire. No matter what, my meal was complete and functional. I did not make a second trip to Cook Out, however I am thankful that my path crossed its. To this day it is the only institution that I know of (besides public elementary schools) that serves chicken nuggets as sides. It was just that bit of nostalgia, combined with the desperate circumstances of hunger and exhaustions that brought me to Cook Out, and I'm thankful for it."}
{"text":"Worst experience I have ever had. We waited in line 20 min. We ordered and when we approached the window and said they didn't have our order and couldn't place our order at the window. They proceeded to tell us to go back through the line. Needless to say we left."}
{"text":"Had the Cookout style burger (homemade chili, slaw, mustard, onions) and it was pretty darn good. Also had the Out west style burger (bbq sauce, bacon, mayo, pickles, onions) but it was blah. I didnt taste any bbq sauce at all. Had the regular chopped bbq sandwich and that was below average. I've had much better.   They have something like 36 flavors of shakes. I had the blueberry cheesecake and it was really, really good. I want to try them all but will probably never get a chance. They have some really tasty sounding ones on the menu.   This place is really inexpensive. Doesn't hurt your wallet at all."}
{"text":"One star because I ate here and didn't die - actually only tried to eat it, really I had to throw most of it in the garbage. Why did I even try? Circumstances, I was famished and didn't have time to go elsewhere.   I think it was BBQ pork and fries? not sure it tasted of ketchup and grease. Honestly I'd compare it to the greasy, stale food sold at third rate county fairs.   Cook out has been in business for 24 years with over 100 locations this sums it up: http://cookoutnc.com/index.php?action=nutrition  Coming soon??? Never. IOW marketing slop to people who don't know or care what they eat."}
{"text":"To be honest I had no idea what Cook Out was until last year (keep in mind I'm from a different country). My friends were raving about this place so I had to try it. The menu was really overwhelming at first because they offer so many different options but it's easy to figure out when you take the time. The trays are amazing! You get 3 different options and a drink for only $5, it's unbeatable. Another thing that surprised me was the quality. You expect to get low quality food for only $5 but you don't. The food tastes amazing and it's super quick. Not to mention that this location is close to UNCC which is perfect for college students and those 3:00 am hangovers."}
{"text":"Their strawberry shake is indescribably delicious,  earned it today...."}
{"text":"For fast food in the southeast this place takes the cake....or should I say shake!  The best food deal on the planet lies in the Cook Out Tray.  $4.25 to stuff your face.  One regular item (burger, dog, or chicken), two sides, and a drink.  The most ridiculous part of this is you can get chicken strips or a corn dog as a side.  Let me repeat, AS A SIDE!!!    And if you aren't full already after reading this, they have the best shakes in the business.  I just got done counting and they offer forty, yes FOUR ZERO, different shake options.  I'm drooling over my keyboard thinking about this place.  If I had a brain, I'd sell all my belongings and start a franchise up in Missouri.  They should start selling wheelchairs here, because people like me may need one after engaging in a meal at this magnificent establishment.  God Bless Cook Out!"}
{"text":"Cook Out's are great and this one is no different than the others. Two drive-thru's make it quick. Keep in mind this is drive-thru only. They specialize in \"fast food\" burgers and milkshakes. The food is relatively inexpensive, but far from fast food quality."}
{"text":"This Cookout is horrible. Cashier was rude. He gave me 2 packs of ketchup. I asked for 2 more and he refused.  My fries were cold! This was my first and last visit!"}
{"text":"Oh, cookout. The place where college kids survive at, during those late night study sessions or those intoxicated nights that want to be forgotten. As part of my friend's tour of NC/South foods we stopped by here on a late night of drinking. One thing he says is that he can't get a peach cobbler shake on the west coast, well my friend you can get one here.  Cook out is one of those places where only the south has. Sort of like In-n-Out is exclusive in West Coast, Cook Out is exclusive to the East Coast (mainly in the south). Now, what to order is what is first asked for newcomers.   If you want shakes. Get a shake. Because from what shake lovers love about this place is that their shakes and variety of them is what makes this place amazing. To me, I'm not really a shake person, but if I did get one I wouldn't mind.  For me, it's about the burgers. I like to get the Cook-Out style burger. It comes with Chili & Slaw, Mustard, and Onions on a good ol' burger. Get some onion rings, or some fried rice and call it a day (or night).   So, if you're in NC and you see this around. You need to stop by and eat it, because you won't find it anywhere else!"}
{"text":"When in Charlotte you have to try this inexpensive fast food alternative!   Ventured over to Cookout after the Brad Paisley concert and I was happy I did.  Where else can you get a choice of burger, chicken, BBQ pork or a quesadilla with two sides and sweet tea for $5 bucks!  And when I say \"sides\", that includes a whole corn dog.  Since when is a corn dog a side?  That was like a meal in itself.  It was tasty and just what was needed at Midnight!   The Hush puppies were great too.  Beef quesadilla was OK - I don't know why I didn't go for the BBQ.  Next time.  Anyway, give 'em a try, \"y'all\" !! Cool place!"}
{"text":"This is actually a 0 out of 5 stars they forgot our entire meal and making us pay for something we didn't order. There was a boy employee shaking his head when he forgot the the entire order. He was smirking at us and I was like who was the one who did wrong not us it was you kid"}
{"text":"I grew up in New Jersey, so I had never had Cook Out until my mom and sisters moved down to Charlotte.  When I went down for a visit, they told me we had to go to Cook Out.  As we pulled up, I became a little disappointed, realizing it was just fast food.  Then we ordered and I took my first bite.  Boy, was my first impression wrong.    Since my first visit, I've had a lot of things on the menu.  My favorite things to order are the bacon cheddar hot dog, the corn dog, the onion rings, and any of the milk shakes.  Our dog adores the corn dogs and it's an absolute must that if you go to Cook Out, he gets a corn dog of his own.  He also loves the milkshakes (check the photos for this location to see him enjoying one).    This has become a must stop destination for each of my visits down to visit family."}
{"text":"I like to think that fast food and barbeque are two separate things that should never be mixed; the idea of getting a decent barbeque sandwich through a drive through window seems like an impossibility to me.  However, when the bartender at the awesome strip mall wine bar told me about this place you could get buggalo of food for less than a five spot, I was sold.    Cook Out is an anomaly among fast food places in that its menu has everything you could ever want, or at least everything I could ever want (sans corn nuggets).  Cook Out offers the boring old hamburger thing but don't let that distract you- opt for the BBQ.  For less than $5, you get your own picnic.    My plate had a hockey puck sized portion of pulled pork, a couple fingers of hush puppies, fries, and slaw. The chronic pulled pork was super moist considering it was 1 AM, and came topped with Texas Pete's.  Although it was delicious, isn't Carolina BBQ supposed to be heavy on the sauce?  The hush puppies were okay (more breading than bread), and the fries forgettable.  When it comes to cole slaw, I am a snob but Cook Out's slaw was surprisingly good; it was house made and very dry, but I mean that in a good way.   It's also worth mentioning that you can get a corn dog as a side.  I don't know why, but as a Southern gentleman, I agree with and salute that.    How Cook Out really let me get my jollies was the drink menu.  Cheerwine- my god, if I ever make a lot of money I'm putting a fountain of that crack drank in my house.  If you're from out of town, drink up because that stuff can only be found in North Carolina.  They also have about 40 different kinds of milkshakes available, including seasonal ones.  The winter shake is eggnog but apparently they only have that one in December.  The fact that they have a watermelon shake in the summer blows my mind.  Be warned though, the shakes are thick like a Petey Pablo video girl- you'll need a spoon, or at least a boba tea straw.    As I said, the idea of a fast food BBQ joint just doesn't do it for me, but Cook Out pulls together the concept beautifully.  It's like if Jesus and Allah got along and then made a baby.  A beautiful mixed baby named Cook Out."}
{"text":"Consistently good burgers. Fries are hit or miss, but their chicken nuggets and chicken wraps are on point. Probably the best fast food \"bang for your buck\" around.   The speakers in the drive through always have me guessing as to what the employees are saying and seriously need to be replaced, but since the conversation is pretty much limited to \"is that all for your order\" or \"what sides do you want\", we manage."}
{"text":"This cook out is ok they like all the other ones got pretty average food. Bad for you lol. But it's straight"}
{"text":"This is the only Cook Out I have ever been to that does not have the dollar shakes, for this reason, I do not go to this location and head over to Concord Mills."}
{"text":"Waited literally 20 minutes in the drive-thru line with only three cars ahead of me, only to be handed a milkshake with a broken lid that filled up 3/4 of the cup. Rude employees, insane wait times, hit and miss qualities of food. Not impressed with this location, at all."}
{"text":"If you want one of the best food bargains that's been around a lot longer then all these $5 meals you just got to try this place. Order a tray and pick your meal. Burger, dogs, chicken fingers, and more. Then add two sides. Such as corn dogs, quesadillas, fries or rings and more to choose from.  And they make real quality milkshakes. Do yourself a favor and go."}
{"text":"Place is super fast and does not play games. The food is always hot and their Hours are amazing."}
{"text":"Forget Chik-fil-A!  How can this place be so cheap and awesome?    I've only had the chicken sandwich, but it tastes sooooooo good!  Just like home-cooked chicken on the grill in your backyard...Minus the bugs.  The sides are hilarious-  corndog, quesadilla, chicken nuggets...  Typical concession food...  I go here for the CHICKEN!  $4.99 for drink, sandwich, two sides.  Love it.  I eat at this chain every time i visit charlotte.  I wish they had these in atlanta!"}
{"text":"The other bad reviews are not exaggerating. Cook Out as a chain is awesome, but the employees at this particular address (2113 Union Rd., Gastonia) are the worst in the United States, for real. They truly suck. I'm never going back here, again. They are so consistently bad that they inspired me to write my first review on Yelp."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on the way back home from Asheville because I was craving some French fried junk food.  The line was long so I was hoping I'd hit French fry heaven.  However this was NOT the case.  I got the cheese fries and hushpuppies.  The hushpuppies has a sweetness to them, but otherwise were very tasteless.  I had to put ketchup on them to liven them up and even then I could only get a few down.  The fries - while large cut were soggy and then the cheese - disgusting.  It's defiantly the out of a can crap you find at ball games to pump out onto your hot dogs.  Maybe this is OK for some, but yuck.  Is it too hard to shred some real cheese to sprinkle on there?  The shake was good.  Very thick, but would I ever go back - nope!  Plus the lady got our order wrong to start with ... which is never good when you have a trail of cars behind you!"}
{"text":"Used to be a good cookout but now it's awful....the line always takes forever even on week nights... Also my burger is ALWAYS BURNT and they mess up my sandwich most of the time.. Not only that they constantly mess up my milkshake order I've probably had to go back for a wrong order 20 times"}
{"text":"What the crap?  We went in and ordered food yesterday and got it in a timely manner.  The food was really good.  So after discussing it, we decided to then go back to the counter and order shakes.  There were five of us and one other customer.  But there was no one manning the register.  For 10 minutes we stood there.  No one came to the register.  Now all this time there were at least four or five other employees in the back.  They passed by and simply looked at us as they went about their duties.  But not a single one called for someone to go take orders up front.  I was half-tempted to start banging on the register keys to get someone up there. Instead, I asked the crew if there was anyone working the register.  All I got was blank stares as they continued to do what they were doing.  Finally, we simply left, along with the other customer,  and then we got ice cream somewhere else.  I guess this store isn't interested in selling food to customers."}
{"text":"Clearly my expectations were set too high.   With such high reviews all over Yelp at various locations, including this one, we intentionally made this a stop driving from Mobile, AL to Maryland in October 2013. Prior to this trip, I had not heard of this chain but reading Yelp reviews I thought it would be a satisfying road trip stop.   Not so much. Perhaps the name tricked me, but I expected flavorful food that felt like you had actually gone to a friend's cook out. Instead, the meal was lack luster, plain and while certainly better than a Mickey D's stop, we both (my S/O and I) were disappointed.  The 1/4 lb burger was actually kind of pathetic.   I will give this chain a couple things. The packaging is great for travelers. The tray/box held our selections perfectly without making a mess in the car. The value is great as well, you get a lot of food for your money.   Of course, I prefer quality of food over quantity, so I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I have lived in this area for years. Hands down the slowest and worst cook out on the planet."}
{"text":"I had cheap hair weave in my tea. There is no way to call them. They are also rude. Fix this cookout and their employees. I guess the better buisness bureau is the only way to reach them."}
{"text":"Cook out is my favorite fast food restaurant but this is by far the worst location I have ever been to. I have them three chances, but every time I went they always messed up. All I asked for was that there be extra quessadilla sauce on my chicken quesadillas. That's the only \"special\" request I had. After three times of ZERO quessadilla sauce on my quesadillas after asking for \"extra extra sauce\" I just couldn't do it anymore. So the one star isn't for the company, but for this specific location. I will say that I called corporate and the sent me two coupons for a free cookout tray. So they do good in that department. But again, it's just this location. The concord mills area location doused my quesadilla in sauce when I asked for \"extra extra sauce,\" just the way I like it! I will never go back to this location. But I will always be a cook out lover."}
{"text":"Although I really like the food here this location in particular isn't the best to go to. They constantly get your order wrong and the employees are anything but friendly. All the employees seem to be interested in anything but you and what you are ordering. When you mention that they messed up your order they get an attitude and act like you ordered the wrong thing on the menu and refuse to correct it. We try to avoid going to this location even if it means driving out of our way."}
{"text":"I eat at this Cookout quite a bit since I work nearby.  I have usually had okay experiences.  I went on New Years Eve night and it was very busy.  The lady on the speaker asked for my order and I gave it to her.  She didn't respond.  10 minutes go by with no response.  I say Hello several times too.  Eventually I pull away because I've waited so long.  It turns out no one was even at that cash register/ window any more.  It would have been nice to know this before I wasted my lunch break waiting on Cookout."}
{"text":"Customer service was terrible the lady at the window complained about having to ask is what we wanted. Complained about it right in front of us. The only reason we didn't say anything was because we were worried she would spit in our food. The food was undercooked and our milkshakes were terrible. I love Cookout but I won't be going back to this location."}
{"text":"Our teenage sons love Cook Out food,  including their caramel cheesecake milkshakes.  I ordered the cajun chicken sandwich and a chicken wrap.  The cajun chicken sandwich was excellent for fast food.  It was moist, flavorful and hit the spot.  The chicken wrap was a bit dry, but worked well with all the special sauces provided.  The \"tray\" deals offer very good value to those on a budget.  Matthews Cook Out is clean and the staff is courteous."}
{"text":"This place is the Taco Bell of American fast food. 5 dollars will fill you up. I usually go through the drive thru and never can understand the person on the other side. They really need to invest in better speakers. Food is ok. You get what you pay for. Their main forte are the fancy milkshakes. The perfect part of a hot summer's day."}
{"text":"Used to be my favorite fast food place but every single time I get a burger here now it's burnt. There's a difference between a charred burger and a burnt burger and apparently whoever the newer people are at this cookout don't know how to cook. It's been like this for a while too. That and my order is messed up frequently despite the drive through attendants knowing me.    At least I can say SOME of the workers are extremely kind and this location is conveniently right across the road from my work."}
{"text":"Good food. Inexpensive, with delicious freshly made milkshakes. Conveniently stays open late. Mostly everything in the menu that I have tasted is good. You can also mix and match different milkshakes to personalize it to your liking."}
{"text":"Went to this cookout about 2 yrs ago. Nothing much different from any of the other cookouts I have been to. Quick service, fresh food, friendly service. Would go back. I will say that their chicken quesadilla, (did I spell that right) is good! Their milkshakes are awesome!"}
{"text":"Just as I think movies should be rated by genre, I believe cookouts should be rated amongst peers. That said, this place is the TAJ MA COOKOUT. Came here on memorial day weekend after a pool party and it definitely hit the spot. I've never been to a cookout with inside seating but this place is sooo nice inside!! Food is typical cookout and I loves me some cookout milkshakes. Definitely get what you expect from this sort of establishment."}
{"text":"I really like the quality of the food I've received at Cookout.  I especially like the fact that they grill the burgers.  The drive thru service is always fast and friendly and I find the prices to be very good given the quality of the food.  I recommend the onion rings and shakes."}
{"text":"I sure wish we had one of these in the DC/MD area.  I love this place they have great shakes and whatever you order off the menu is always good.  This is the prefect place to grab something off the late night after an event to take care of those after hour munchies."}
{"text":"It's cookout! One of those things you have to experience yourself. Love the bacon wrap as a side on the tray, Good addicting, awesome tea. They sell Cheerwine, lots of options on shakes. BBQ sandwich is pretty good"}
{"text":"Oh, I am afraid even to write about Cook Out. I gained 20 pounds last year with their crackshakes...I mean milkshakes. My standard is the Oreo cookie shake, but every now and then, I'd mix it up with a cobbler shake or a crazy chocolate cherry kind of thing. You also can't go wrong with the peanut butter fudge option...and add bananas to the peanut butter fudge, and you have something spectacular...  Cook Out may not have the greatest service, and other than milkshakes and french fries, there is absolutely nothing for vegetarians...but it matters not. There is no better milkshake in the world...nowhere, ever. I'm not exaggerating.  Perhaps it's not quite proper to call them milkshakes, as you can't really suck them through a straw. It's spoon-only.  If you haven't had Cook Out yet, you are missing a vital part of Charlotte culture. This little chain is only available in our region...we are truly favored by the gods."}
{"text":"This place is great! We wish they had one where we lived because it's so great. The value is excellent. We always get the cookout box. The shakes are amazing. The hot dogs grilled and delicious. The grilled chicken is so tasty."}
{"text":"It's cheap, it's fast, it's tasty enough. Would I like them to use real cheese and have sour cream on hand for my quesadilla? Of course. Do I think it's going to happen? No. Am I still going to go back on the regular. Yes, I like the burgers, the corn dogs, and all the other fast, slightly greasy junk food way too much to give it up. Great for a quick, easy guilty pleasure."}
{"text":"One of the best road trip stops ever! Great food for an excellent price."}
{"text":"Tried the oreo shake today....to die for.  So delicious.  I only wish they had a smaller size....."}
{"text":"The best place to go late at night when you are very hungry. I have always loved the shakes here!"}
{"text":"Southern style fast food barbecue and burgers at a good price but served on styrofoam with plastic cutlery makes lots of waste"}
{"text":"Damn! Came in hungry at 11 at night, and was greeted with super-friendly service, and the cashier picked out some winners for me from the combo menu.  She nailed it - awesome cup of chili, perfect hush puppies and a barbecue sandwich that's better than a fast good joint should have.  Papa's sleeping well tonight.  One thing tho...are the bug zappers inside for decoration? Hope so...."}
{"text":"Tasty burgers. Yummy shakes (truly) made with fresh peanut butter and other goodies. Oh-so-tasty fresh cut fries. Super-clean. Friendly staff. Cheap."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with the sweet tea, corn dogs and the Cajun fries. Holy [bleep] they are delicious. I have yet to eat anything else. So satisfying! And I will let you all in on my master shake combo I've introduced to my boyfriend and his roommates... OREO & CAPPUCINO. You're all welcome. Are your minds blown yet? And put that in the freezer for an amazing dessert if you want."}
{"text":"Great fast food.   They just need better side items.  When everything you order is the same color you know your eating crap food for your body.   Why not have some healthier side items.  The grilled chicken without mayo isn't a terrible fast fold option, but then you get to the sides.    How about corn/greens/apple slices/fruit cup.   It's not that hard for a busy restaurant to add these options to their menu."}
{"text":"I had to clean my own table. I had to ask for sweet tea to be made.Three small chicken fingers three small onion rings.This location went down hill.Trying show how small the chicken strips are. You need new management.  Will not come back. Extremely noisy. You want shout to tell the teenie boppers shut up."}
{"text":"When I want fast food, there is really no reason to go anywhere besides Cookout. They have real hamburgers, great fries, BBQ sandwiches w/ slaw & hot sauce, and incredibly good milkshakes. You get a lot of calories for the price too!"}
{"text":"The food is always good, the service,  not so much. There were 4 of us in the car, the lady taking out orders keep interrupting us and would not let use give her all the complete order. She also keep talking to other people in the store. Add to it all SHE did not get our order quiet right!"}
{"text":"Where else can I get a double bacon cheese burger, fries, corn dog and milkshake all for under six dollars? Oh wait no where."}
{"text":"Cook out came to the rescue! We arrived in Charlotte and were starving, but still in a rush to get to our final destination in Asheville. While we could've just as easily stopped for lackluster fast food á la Mickey D's, we came to realize that Cook Out is kind of a \"thing\" in these parts, so we gave it a shot. I like that you can build an interesting meal including sides like corn dogs. The burger was the winner here, so I'd recommend you go with that. Just some good old fried food for THOSE days (you know the ones I'm talking about!)"}
{"text":"BLT, Burgers, Fries, Barbecue, Milkshakes - Excellenté. Ridiculously cheap. Fast service."}
{"text":"Customer service needs improvement , forgot items on my order. Fortunately manager was apologetic!! Got my items right"}
{"text":"So nice to have an indoor Cook-Out in the neighborhood. Right near CMC Pineville so people can step out for great burgers, BBQ, and shakes.  The hush puppies have a Fritos taste with a light touch of onion. Goes great with pulled pork BBQ sandwich. Wish they had frag lemon slices for the ice tea.  Pineville is now on the map!"}
{"text":"I wanted a shake so I walked across the street and decided Id get a burger too. However the burger patty was so thin and small in comparison to the bun size! You barely noticed that there was a hamburger patty! Only tasted the ketchup and mustard. No taste to the burger at all and complete waste of $2.00.  The strawberry shake was average.  Definitely would not go back again for anything! Go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Burgers are on par with 5 Guys.  Except thicker patties and not over-cooked (5 guys overcook and their burgers are thin) Their shakes are good if you like vanilla ice cream."}
{"text":"I came here for the hush puppies! We had to stop here before heading back to MD. Cook Out is similar to a Sonic drive-in where you can order through the drive-thru or outside. You get two sides with your choice of meal and a drink. I ordered chicken tenders with a side of hush puppies and fries. I wish I ordered double hush puppies because they were everything my friends described them to be and more. They are known for their burgers and milkshakes with 40+ flavors but since the drive back home was long I wasn't going to risk it! I settled for a sweet tea and it wasn't too shabby. I can't wait to try their burgers and milkshakes next time I'm back in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Cook Out in years but gave it a go again but different location.  I had a taste for a burger and BK shut down.  This place seems a weekend hangout one night I passed by. The menu was very thorough and more choices than I thought they'd have.  The line was busy but not overwhelming long.  I got a cookout style burger with fries and decided to get a hot dog as well with a sweet tea.  I was asked what side besides the fries.  I asked what else were options, I heard nuggets and i asked for nuggets which I thought was odd for a side.  When I got to pay, the total was more than I was told as he handed me one of the drinks and it was the people's order behind me but mine was ready.  I get home and that side needed up being hushpuppies which had me thinking they were referred to as nuggets but it was a mix up.  I was charged the $11 but reversed immediately once the mix up was recognized.  Nevertheless, everything was tasty."}
{"text":"I've passed by several cookout locations and always wanted to try them, so on my lunch break I drive here to see what this place is like. Ordering and drive through was great... Good service, patient taking my order... It's the food that won't bring me back. I'm not sure what kind of beef they're using, maybe some kind of hybrid cow but the stuff was just not good at all. I didn't even finish my burger which was supposed to be their rendition of a Carolina Classic. Something about the meat used turns me off... The texture of it was really crumbly and had no taste. I did get onion rings though and those were good and crunchy, but I won't be coming back here unless its to try a milkshake everybody on here is raving about. I was gonna leave just 2 stars, but have an extra one for good service."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service, cheap prices, food always is just right, no complaints here!!  Definitely A++ 105% rating from me!"}
{"text":"A family member ate at this location 5 pm 3/2/16, Just got back from the doctor & was diagnosed with food poisoning . This family member eats at the one in Indian Trail location often and never had an issue. What a terrible experience for my family member, I hope this location cleans up their act before more people become sick!"}
{"text":"Not bad at all. Wasn't expecting much but the food was surprisingly tasty and I enjoyed it. The burger had that real \"cookout\" taste and I was happy I decided to try it. Plus you get a hell of a lot of food for a cheap amount of money."}
{"text":"PERFECT! The brothas that work this location (13317 York Center Dr)during the late night shift, just before they close @ either 3AM or 4AM, are completely on point with the food! They deserve raises and an uprgade to Full time, all day everyday!  The food is just right, Crunchy onion rings and nuggets, the chicken breast is charred the right way, just like a cookout is supposed to be!  All the other workers must be newbies and beginners, because whenever I visit during the day or any other time the bruhs are not there, the food is not right.  Soggy nuggets and rings with no crunch. Get rid of those workers completely!  But whoever the late night team of brothas are, need to definitely  be given big time raises for their expertise in cooking food! Call me so that I can give the praise in person 7046665411-Davio"}
{"text":"I've frequented Cook Outs around Charlotte, but ever since I moved to this side of town, I haven't been to my neighborhood location that often. After a bad experience at 3 am on a Saturday night left a car full of us empty-bellied and scarred for life (I believe the words out of our mouths were \"MIKE, GET US OUT OF HERE NOW, I JUST WANT TO LIVE!\") I haven't had much of a taste for hush puppies, you know?  But a few weeks ago I put on a brave face and decided to scope out the sketchiness-factor a bit earlier in the evening, successfully achieved a milkshake, and lived to tell about it. Since then I've been back a couple of times, but again, before 1 am. The BBQ plate is one of my staples- it is dirt cheap and man is it delicious.   The police officers are totally necessary- partially for safety, but mostly to direct the traffic. (There are 2 lanes, you know, and you can't exit through the entrance, guys.) Look, I really don't think my fear is unfounded, it is not a great neighborhood. Stick with the semi-late hours and you should be fine."}
{"text":"You aren't going to get a fancy Kobe beef hamburger on a brioche bun here. That's fine.   What you are going to get is a burger that tastes like what you usually get when you are grilling at a friend's. Brilliant.   Glad we stopped here!"}
{"text":"My experience:   Drive through takes forever.   They over charge people.  Speaker in drive through is broken and hasn't been fixed in forever which mean orders may be wrong.   Food here isn't the best.   The number to this location doesn't work.   Staff are blatantly Rude.   Dirty inside. Hmmm sanitary? No!"}
{"text":"I come here for one reason and one reason only. Milkshake specials. They're the right mix for a shake. Thick and creamy.  And the right price. 99 cents for a good size portion, at least an avg of 2 serving sizes.   Other food is pretty decent, too. Reminds me of fair food with the taste and variety. And who doesn't like a good old fair with the rides and the junk food.   Even though I love the tandem drive thru, you've definitely got to watch out for the other side. Once people have their good greasy food, they're gone quickly."}
{"text":"Cashiers are always friendly food is usually always hot however it's always busy here"}
{"text":"COOK OUT is a must. Every time I see one I have to stop. Great prices, great quality, and awesome shakes. Their menu is all inclusive and you'll feel like you got your money's worth once you leave. It can be difficult to find fast food that's fresh, but their burgers are grilled to order... when you bring up genuine fast food take a trip to Cook Out and please don't forget to order a shake!"}
{"text":"great simple and awesome flavor! Almost like In-n-Out!  I order 2 of the doubles and a milkshake to satisfy my hunger"}
{"text":"I do NOT like the food here. I have better cook-out eats in many a backyard of many a friend. Five Guys has a MUCH, MUUUUCH better burger and fries...though C.O. scores points for hush puppies that, when cooked right, are crispy outside yet soft and warm inside. When cooked wrong they are bland and dry.   So why three stars instead of one or two? One word: SHAKES. Toe curling, gut busting, jean popping, shakes. More flavors and combos than even my freaky memory can recall. They are sooo thick you need a spoon or risk sucking out a lung trying to use a straw. Word to the wise: ask for the shake made thin if you are indulging while driving. The Mint Oreo is my fave but the choc pb is awesome and the banana is delic, too. If I was judging soley on the shakes, 5 stars. Yes, the icecream junkie says the shakes are THAT good!"}
{"text":"Wonderful! So much tastier than your run-of-the-mill fast food joint like McDonalds or Burger King. The food tastes so fresh and you can get a ton of food for just a few bucks. I LOVE the Bacon Ranch Wrap. The bacon here is spectacular--probably the best I've ever had. What a great deal for 99 cents. Lines are sometimes long but go very quickly. Best cheap eats around cville!"}
{"text":"This is top-rate fast food. I grew up in NC and had no idea this place existed. Apparently they still don't have an internet presence and the only sites with CookOut information are fan sites. Whoa! That's nuts.   We went with the whole family and got tons of food. It was fast and delicious. The cheerwine float was an interesting take on an old classic - and who doesn't love cheerwine? - and the milkshakes are just plain awesome. I tried a peach and a pineapple milkshake and they were both terrific. I'd never hesitate to get the shake here - they're cheap and among the better ones I've ever had (unlike, say, McDonald's, they taste like \"real\" food).  I had a plain chicken sandwich along with a side of slaw and hush puppies. The hush puppies were unremarkable, but the slaw was surprisingly good and the chicken sandwich tasted like a real chicken sandwich. I think what we most liked about CookOut was how genuine the food seems - it's fast food but it doesn't feel processed like the more notable chains.  And, best of all, we paid about $5 a head for 6 people. It's crazy crazy cheap. And still delicious!"}
{"text":"confirmed the best cook out i have been to (which is a lot) and i refuse to believe otherwise"}
{"text":"The staff is always friendly. They are fast with getting your food to you. They have the best onion rings."}
{"text":"This place is normally good during the lunch/dinner hours, but go during late....drive thru and it can be a \"surprise\" if you order more than one entrée. It's obvious the night drive thru staff are rookies and it shows. Not only was our order wrong but the burgers tasted strange, food poisoning occurred during the night. The next day,(11:00 am) spoke to the manager on duty to explain  what happened the night before. He's only remark was \"sorry, he wasn't on duty then\" Great management response....."}

{"text":"I mean can you really go wrong with cookout. The food is pretty much like any other cookout the only issue that I've ever had at this location is when they may be not accepting debit cards or not accepting cash or something they won't tell you you'll just sit in line for nothing and pull up and be pissed lol"}
{"text":"Super fast service and sweet cashiers.  Will be going there during my lunch break again. LOVE their banana pudding milkshake and they also have really good burgers and chicken strip.  Fries could be better.  But overall, great food and great experience and this cookout."}
{"text":"Was in Charlotte in March and Omg the cook out!!! Why oh why do we have nothing whatsoever like this in Miami??? 4 am - yummy pulled pork, corn dog, hush puppies, cole slaw and the best damn banana shake I've ever had in my entire life for like 6 or 7 bucks. Coming from the land of batidos and where bananas actually grow, I'm tempted to look up franchising information but apparently this little chain does not stray far from it's queen city. Win. All around."}
{"text":"The Freedom Drive Cook Out is a very special place. The convenient double drive-through, ever-present squad cars (I hear this used to be a pretty bad neighborhood), super-fast and friendly service; all good things. But nothing holds a candle to their 40 fresh milkshakes.  The peach cobbler shake is my favorite--it's peach cobbler a la mode that you can suck through a straw!! (Duh, it's a milk shake, but ommm...) A very close second is the watermelon milkshake, only available July through August. I can't think of anything more refreshing on a hot summer day than chilled chunks of watermelon in ice cream. Sooo good. The servers seem to be having fun too; last time I was there I caught a shake competition and had to decide who'd made the best one. I think I was the winner there.  For the savory crowd, they offer crazy cheap variety platters with burgers, fries and barbecue choices, but don't believe the hype if you're with a hungry crowd. The trays are disappointingly small (how else could they offer all that for $5?) and really could only satisfy one person with a big appetite (me). The burgers are pretty good, juicy. Before moving to NC I'd never heard of the Cook Out chain; glad that's been fixed!"}
{"text":"I loved cookout when it first came till Charlotte, but out has seemed to go down in the last few years especially the burgers. They used to look and taste like they came fresh off the outdoor grill, but now they taste more processed. The service is sub-par at best. The only saving grace is they are open for a late night food run. And I guess i could say this is the perfect after-party food, but is that really a good thing."}
{"text":"Ms T and I flew to Charlotte for a few days, just to visit.  We arrived a little late on a Saturday night and did not have a place to eat planned, so close to our hotel was this place called Cook Out and we decided that a burger would be fine.  We understood going in, that it is a regional fast food chain and while we normally would not go to a large chain,  thought this one might be worth a try.  We found it to be better than we expected.  This is kind of fast food North Carolina style.  The regular burger is 1/4 lb and has decent char-grill flavor.  I had Cook Out Style which has their chili and slaw.  The slaw was OK, a little flat but thankfully no detectable onion.  The chili was thick with not a lot of flavor but little or no cumin and no beans, so OK.  The whole thing was not the best I ever had, but I love burgers with chili and slaw and if I lived here, I would certainly use this for my quick fix once in a while.  Ms T really liked her plain cheeseburger.  It was the char flavor.  I also had a plain chili dog that was fine.  Of course, it is the same chili.  The dog was a soft skinless type, not highly flavored, on a soft white bun.  All in all OK.  While I was at it, I also had to have a chopped pork sandwich.  The barbecue was mild, with a very fine chop, eastern style.  It was also OK, not remarkable.  I had slaw on it and hit it with Texas Pete.  All in all, this is certainly good choice if you are going for fast food and I'm sure it is pretty consistent.  We liked it, solid three stars."}
{"text":"Cookout tops all other fast food joints for inaccurate orders. Call 1-866-547-0011 if not 100% satisfied. Says so on cup."}
{"text":"I went through the drive through on Friday night. The guy taking my order was sarcastic and I thought this was rude. He asked for my order, then told me to hold on. I was fine with that at first.  Then as I preceded to give him my order, he would repeat the wrong information back to me, he would interrupt me as I tried to continue my order. Very FRUSTRATING!  At this point, I feel like he knew I was angry and did this on purpose. I canceled my order, I did not purchase anything, I waited in the drive thru, just to leave. Instead, I went to Zaxby's, next door.  Your associates could learn some real customer service from Zaxby's.  They were on top of it.  They guy who was working your drive thru should be fired for being so rude!"}
{"text":"Great burgers, hushpuppies, fries, onion rings, shakes, Cheerwine floats...and all for a great price.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"So I've heard a lot about cookout when I moved to NC and I was exited to check it out, but this location has to be the worst. I had a bbq sandwich with no bbq, and a skimpy quesadilla like u never seen, I'm not picky but wow the bbq sandwich was absolutely disgusting and a waste of money I had no bbq and smothered in old onions and mayo, idk wtf that was literally had to throw it away and I was hungry af.  I love the tray concept! I just wish the food pulled together. Also missed a lot on our order like utensils for chili and coleslaw and ranch when we asked for it to find nothing.  Anyways the only good thing I can say is the peanut butter milkshake was on point which is why 2 Star otherwise it would be 1star the rest of the order went in the garbage. Thanks.  I would recommend going to another location at least. Don't waste the time."}
{"text":"Friends I've been here a lot. For my belly I don't know what too many times is. The tray is great. Look I'm not coming here for a New York strip steak I know that when I start the car. It's fast food. It's nothing you tell the doctor you frequent. You will have gas. You won't spend a whole lot. I'm not putting half a menu on here if you made it this far you can look it up on their website. The foods been warm their ain no green buns or any burger king snot balls in my sandwich. I enjoy the $1 shake add on and the cheerwine floats aren't sold in stores. I will dock them a star for the drive through. I can't understand the people and they can't understand or hear me. I've gone in ordered and beat the line of cars to talk to a person so I don't have the hearing problems outside. If the line inside ain long save a quarter in gas and go in. Ain nothing wrong with 8 cars in the drive through though as they're quick and it's great for business. Stick a big double burger in one hand and a chicken wrap in the other and stopping wasting your time reading this."}
{"text":"I don't think I've been to a Wendy's or Burger King intentionally since I discovered Cook Out. This North Carolina mainstay easily takes the local fast food crown on speed and freshness. I heard a rumor once that the target time between your completed order and when you leave the window is 90 seconds - that's half the time that Starbucks allots, and you're getting a lot more than coffee! Everything I've ever eaten from Cook Out - here, or any location of the 70+ strong chain - tastes like it was made just seconds before I get it. The burgers and veggie toppings are crisp and juicy. The corn dogs are still steaming when you bite through the breeding. And the hush puppies hit the styrofoam tray so hot that they often melt into or through the foam.  Even without these surefire winners, you can't beat the Cook Out value. Five bucks gets you a Cook Out tray: their combo meal which lets you pick one of eight main events (the Big Double burger and Spicy Chicken sandwiches win big). Then you get to pick two (yes two) sides such as fries, hush puppies, onion rings, a corn dog, chicken nuggets, chili, a chicken tender wrap or a chicken quesadilla. Yep. Those are sides, and you get TWO. Toss in a big soda or a huge sweet tea and you've got more meal than any other burger joint for $2-4 less. That's beyond a deal, it's just about crazy.  My one issue with the food is really unsurprising - after a while, it all tastes the same. Most of the deep fried foods have the same taste, more than likely because they're all fried in the same grease. Even the burgers and buns get that flavor too. It's easy to combat this, of course - just don't make the mistake I made and go 2-3 times a week when you discover Cook Out.  But if you need that greasy fast food and want something now, you can't beat Cook Out on speed and freshness. The fact that your wallet will thank you is the icing on the cake (or more accurately, the cheese on the burger)."}
{"text":"4 stars for the service  3.5 stars for the food (2 hotdog combo) but I think we were charged extra for the chili which is fine but put up a notice about that like the drink \"upgrade\" to shake shows.   4 stars for all the options for dining.   The kid gave the place a solid \"I like it\" based on the shake alone. Then added additional kudos to the fries because we ate them 1.5 hours later and they tasted decent.   I think all other locations must have to compete with this one for great service."}
{"text":"I moved here in May. I've been to this cookout 7 times so far. 6 out of the times I went here they messed up my order, simply by giving me the wrong things that I did not order. Hire some people that know the difference between fries and his puppies please!!!"}
{"text":"Ew. Not a fan. Didn't get my order right and what we did get was not good. Those Cajun fries were the worst fries I've ever had. They served them to us cold and hard. The only reason I would come here is if it's 2am and I'm drunk. Although the strawberry milkshake was pretty good. They got 2 stars instead of 1 because of the milkshake. Didn't like any of the food."}
{"text":"Great quality for tiny price.  Hot, fresh, made to your order, with milkshakes that are the BEST.  Cheap and cheerful.  Strawberry shake had many chunks of strawberry, double chocolate was as advertised.  And they were so thick with ice cream that you had to wait in order to get the shake thru your straw. Wish we had this up north in CT.  EXCELLENT VALUE!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to get a good quick greasy burger and fries.  This will make you feel good as you bite into the burger and all of the juices just seep out of your mouth.  I must warn you....you will need a napkin.  They seemed to have invented the double drive-thru system as this was the first place I have ever seen it in Charlotte. They are very busy, and they have done this right.  Even McD's followed this idea in several locations.  The burgers are reasonably priced, the service is fast and friendly, and the sanitation score was 97.5.  When you are in the neighborhood, you should give these guys a try, they provide a great value burger with excellent taste, and lots of flavor.  I have included a picture of the small burger with bacon and cheese $2.14 (before taxes).  4 Stars.  NCFoodGuy"}
{"text":"I've been to many different locations but this one has some amazing cooks who are doing an amazing job. Chili cheese burger with fries and a chocolate shake was transcendent: elevating me to a place of true satisfaction. Considering this, for a price of 6.99 it was at a price that can't be beat."}
{"text":"I love cook out! i wish there were more of them! I like the regular done cheddar style and of course you have to get the cajun seasoning on the fires! that is a must! this one is a bit different then the one in columbia. it is a lot bigger and only one drive thru lane but that ok. so now every time i have to go the 40 minutes to Mattews to the doctor i will be hitting tis place on my way home!"}
{"text":"Always remember that what you order isn't really an order. It's more like a request, and they'll decide what you get. I've ordered a burger and received a chicken sandwich. Yes, I know, I didn't check it before I pulled away. But, this is a habit here. I've ordered a chicken sandwich and received a burger. I've gotten home and found I was missing items. I've ordered a peanut butter milkshake and got green apple. I can't seem to get an Oreo mint milkshake. I've tried three times and got just Oreo. I think they did try to put mint in one once. There was green stuff around the rim, so I scooped it up with my spoon and my first bite was mint Oreo. It was good. After that though, the rest of it was just plain Oreo.  The food is typical Cookout food. Not horrible. It's the bad service, the attitude that they really don't care about your experience, and the fact that you're not a customer, you're an inconvenience, that matters most here.  It's up to you, but I've given up trying to give them chance after chance to get my order right, and I just go to one of the other dozen fast food places within two minutes of there."}
{"text":"This location is normally slammed during lunch, which is fine. What is not fine is the fact that you sometimes have to repeat your whole order 2 or 3 times. I'm not sure if the speaker system is broken or what, but when they ask you to repeat it, they sound rather rude. Also, thanks for the 4 whopping onion rings with my meal"}
{"text":"Before I moved to Cotswald, I lived eerily close to a Cook Out.  I would tell myself I was going repeatedly for the food, but deep down I knew it was a lie.  I was going for the milkshakes and my former size 32 waist could vouch for this realization.  The milkshakes are simply devastatingly good.  Do not attempt to suck these bad boys through a straw, you will get lockjaw faster than Paris Hilton on Ritalin.    Use the provided plastic spoon and eat yourself into buying new jeans heaven."}
{"text":"It is tradition to simply stop at a Cook out when driving to Alabama. When I asked did they have vegetarian options, the cashier told me that they gave a vegetarian sandwich. It was simply a burger without the meat. no complaints! In addition, I ordered onion rings which were fabulous.   My sister order the combo tray with a burger, double order of chicken nuggets, and a bottled water. Her meal was $4.99, and she had a lot of food.   This place is truly for any budget!"}
{"text":"I have to give the three stars because I've heard so much hype about how good this place is. It's a decent burger with less than stellar sides. The great thing is that you can make 5 bucks stretch. I suggest any out of towner come here to try it, but if you look for high quality in burgers, you won't be too impressed."}
{"text":"I just love their burgers and the choices & I'm glad it's a normal sized burger.  I'm not a fan of their fries, but that's ok.  Milkshakes are phenomenal."}
{"text":"Food and service are both very good. Combo menu is hard to beat. This location has indoor seating."}
{"text":"My go to spot I always get a tray 2 quesadilla honey mustard chicken wrap and fries and sweet tea , for a low price , great memories here also , and strawberry cheesecake milkshake is the bomb trust me order it next time you visit. Some of the workers here are creepy though"}
{"text":"I love cookout, it is the best place to go with friends late at night if you've been out having a night of drinking shenanigans or if you're just craving a good milkshake and fries; their milkshakes are amazing."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's quick, good and cheap. The portion sizes are just right and for the perfect price. I get burger with all the toppings, onion rings, slaw and drink for $5, can't beat that. The customer service has been good and I have always received the food fresh and hot. They have Christian radio on so it's a pleasant family atmosphere, highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"There is nothing extraordinary about this Cook Out.  On the plus side they are more easily understood than at other Cook Out locations - don't know why but I can actually understand the total amount when they say it.  On the negative side is that unless you are going the a specific direction there is a difficult turn around required to get back on track."}
{"text":"I adore Cook Out it is probably the best drunk food you can eat, but it even tastes good sober. Going to any Cook Out immediately brings back fond college memories of us crammed into the DD's car eagerly awaiting the food. Even broke college kids can afford the $5 Cook Out tray and sometimes even splurge that extra $1 upcharge for their fancy shakes.  I lived within walking distance of this location when I first moved to Charlotte but hadn't been back until this past weekend. I realized I had missed Cook Out so much I went twice, and each visit left a little to be desired (despite my love of the chain).  The first Cook Out run was facilitated by a kind uber driver after some shenanigans nearby. Their new menu design made the tray options not visible from my seat so I assumed they did away with that wonderful package. We kept it simple getting a cheeseburger, hushpuppies and a hot dog. When the driver pulled up the worker tried to hand her a large sweet tea. She gave it back saying it must be the wrong order. They scrambled for a bit to find our order but we eventually went on our way with everything correct in the end.  The next day, we decided that we had not had enough magical greasy food so we went back. This time we got out of the car and walked up to order at the window. Now that the tray portion of the menu was clearly visible I ordered a big double with cheese, lettuce, tomato and a side cheese quesadilla and side of chicken nuggets. I also got a banana milkshake and a hot dog. Hi, I am a fat kid, you can judge now. The problem was, that upon returning home I realized there was no tomato on the burger and no hotdog for me in the bag. Now, I understand that mistakes happen. But 2 incorrect orders in less than 24 hours?   Hoping for improvement on the next visit."}
{"text":"I go to this location very frequently. Dine in and drive-thru.  Their food is absolutely delicious. My favorite items are the Cheddar Style Burger, French Fries with cheese, Hush puppies, Coleslaw, Chicken Nuggets.. it's all good!  They could up the customer service a bit, but the food has never been disappointing. I also love how they play Christian music in the restaurant, and there's bible passages on the cups and stuff. Also, fantastic milkshakes."}
{"text":"The people that work here are very rude and you need to speak fluent Ebonics otherwise they get upset also don't ask for sauce or extra napkins as the young lady told me \"dis ain't da red lobsta\"If I could compare the service to anything just look up bon qui qui on YouTube. The food is usually good."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The burgers are really fresh and the milkshakes are absolutely delicious"}
{"text":"One of the better Cook Out locations because it has an inside area like a standard fast food restaurant. It gets hit hard at lunch time and rush hour in the evening. The inside seems to never stay especially clean and tidy. Staff is nicer here than some other locations but it seems unanimous amongst most fast food employees that they hate their jobs.  Lots of food variety including burgers, chicken sandwiches (grilled and fried), fries and even quesadillas to name just a few. They're most well known for their milkshakes but these days I find it hard to stomach an entire one. They sell only one size and it's a pint. They should consider offering a 12oz option. The parking lot and drive through are difficult to navigate and a bit treacherous. The flow of traffic causes a lot of congestion."}
{"text":"Great menu.  The food was cooked to order.  Very unique choices for sides that come with your sandwich.  Corn dogs, onion rings, 2 types of fries and other choices.  I am told the BBQ here is good too but went for a burger.  The portions are small but with the sides they give you a bunch of food for the price.    I will be going back!"}
{"text":"I go here way too often.  There are other Cook-Outs around, but this is the only one I know of with indoor seating -- and it just happens to be the closest one to me.  The dining room's open until 11pm (12am on weekends), and the drive-through's open til 1am or 3am.  The \"Cook Out tray\" is a great deal: a sandwhich, two sides, and a large drink for less than $5 (you can substitute a shake for the huge drink for $1.. and add a regular soda, and save some change; Coke and Cheerwine on tap). I get either a double burger \"Cook Out style\" (chili & slaw) or \"steak style\" (steak sauce and grilled onions), or a chicken sandwich \"original style\", and add sides of a corndog and fries (skip the onion rings -- they're nasty).  Their fries are good; other places have better burgers, but not this cheaply.  Sandwich, fries, corndog (or bacon wrap, or chicken wrap), soda, and milkshake, all for about $8.  The hardest question is, what kind of shake to get.  There are about 40 flavors; my favorites are oreo mint, peach cobbler, and orange push-up, but sometimes I'll vary it and get chocolate malt, or chocolate cherry, or strawberry, or....  Some of the flavors are just too sweet for me (walnut, pecan pie). Generally, I stick with flavors that I'd actually eat with ice cream -- they have cherry cheesecake milkshakes, but eating cheesecake with ice cream doesn't sound like fun to me.   Now -- the noise.  It varies.  Sometimes, you could be the only person eating here, but sometimes, a busload of teens will show up."}
{"text":"A few years ago I was skeptical to all the hype around CookOut. Now I understand why!  The food is good. The menu is huge. Plenty of options available depending upon your cravings.   And don't get me started on the milkshakes! Over 40 flavors available. I have yet to have a flavor I didn't like. To date, my go-to flavor is \"Chocolate Cobbler!\"  Great location! Very nice inside. Plenty of parking with the adjacent shopping center."}
{"text":"The Cook Out is an interesting beast because no one can seem to figure out where they're based.  I've heard reports that they are out of Greensboro (NC), but they don't seem to have a web site at this writing, and it just doesn't seem to be anything that anyone can verify.  Nonetheless, the company is doing something right.  Their down-home style, the original hamburgers \"cooked outdoors style\", the 36 \"creamery\" premium milkshakes and the retro styling of the building has kept the double drive-thru near our house hopping since they opened nearly six months ago.  My only complaint is that the milkshakes are more like a soft-serve sundae.  Nothing wrong with that, mind you, it just makes it hard to drink through the straw.  The flavor is stll quite good, you understand.  It's just better eaten with a spoon.  As to the food, it's good.  I'm not a huge fan of burgers, so it's tough to judge, but I've been happy enough with what I've had to eat, and the family seems to be okay with what they have had as well.  Not earth-shattering, but not bad either.  Probably worth checking out the next time you're driving by one."}
{"text":"Lines are always long but they are quick to get your order. I usually go through drive thru. Sweet tea is so good. Cajun chicken sandwich is my favorite item on the menu. Spicy chicken is ok but way too much breading. Chicken nuggets are a good snack. Side of chili is always good too."}
{"text":"Ate lunch here today. I don't know why I keep coming back but I do. It has to be the price. It has to be!!"}
{"text":"I usually come to this cookout because its the closest to my house snd the food is usually on point. I get the same thing everytime. Cookout tray w a burger fries and coleslaw. For once i didnt eat the whole thing it just wasnt that great. Shortly after my stomach started hurting. This was 2/6. I still havent been able to eat and it is now 2/8. I cannot even hold to much liquid before i throw up. Cold sweats since that night and now im short of breath. I will not be returning to this cookout. EVER  Update**** I was unable to eat for 2 more days bringing it to 2/10 with cold sweats, fever, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, and a severe headache that lasted 3days even with meds.   Since then i did go back but only for fries. I told the associate at the window what happened & he looked at me like i was lying & said i should've brought it back.   Me taking the food back was the last thing on my mind i was to busy trying to figure out why i felt like i was dying   But ok.........."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for a burger on Albemarle, this is your best bet. The great thing about cookout is that they will gladly customize anything for you. Their cookout trays are a great deal and it lets you try a little of everything. Their milkshakes are Divine. While it is fast food, they done put a burger on the grill till it's ordered and the milkshakes contain real ingredients! The service is okay, and the location is easy as you can use a traffic light to get back on Albemarle."}
{"text":"I love me some cook out. This location always gets my order right and the employees are very kind! The prices are great and the food always tastes amazing. This is the perfect place to hit up late at night since they are open late."}
{"text":"One of the best fast-food burgers in town. Taste and quality is superb. True story. One day I went to Wendy's cause line was long at cookout. As I was eating the Wendy's burger I noticed the texture and taste was sickening. I can no longer eat Wendy's or McDonald's burgers they can't compare to cookout"}
{"text":"Ode to Cook Out:  You give us tasty burgers and delicious shakes, When my belly starts a rumblin' and quakes, I speed through your double drive through & fulfill that ache.   While it's not the healthiest I could possibly eat, Those six pounds of milkshakes do taste so sweet.   I love your grill, your specials & lunch, Even your fries have a pretty great crunch.   I know I'll be back to call on you once more,  To request a fat milkshake for you to pour."}
{"text":"The great thing about this place is that it is open late night so you will not die of hunger!!! The food is good, they are fast and very friendly. Sitting out and eat at late night make it a good time."}
{"text":"It's good fast food that's unique to the Carolinas.  The food was tasty (but not the best of fast food chains), and it is amazing value -- you get a sandwich, drink and two sides for just $4.99.  So that's why it deserves four stars.    It tends to be typical greasy, southern style American food -- but that's why you're trying it!  Definitely worth trying if you're visiting from out of state."}
{"text":"When I went to Fayetteville, NC last year and tried a cookout for the first time, my mind was blown by how cheap the food was. Well once again my mind was blown when I was taken to this location... Not ONLY is the food cheap and greasy amazing deliciousness you can also sit INSIDE!!! WHAT?! You don't have to wait to eat your super awesome food now?? Holy Crap. I mean, let's be honest, once I drove away from the window I was already reaching across the seat into the warmth of the bag strapped in next to me to devour it before I was even home. What? Why are you laughing?? Don't tell me you don't strap your food in from Cookout! I know better!  OK seriously though, it's great that you can actually go inside at some of the locations too. Some days I'm not in a super crazy rush so I actually enjoy tasting my food from cookout. Oh and side note... the blue berry milkshake is enough to make me want to buy a franchise for myself, except I'd make no money because I'd be eating all my own food. OK. I'll just visit a lot instead :D"}
{"text":"My favorite fast food joint. Has everything you could possibly want for a low price. My choice tray is the grilled chicken club style sandwich, Cajun fries, hushpuppies and a huge sweet tea. Watermelon milkshakes sound nasty, but they are actually pretty good."}
{"text":"Disappointed in the cheeseburger after our long-awaited experience. Have had their milkshakes several times - Excellent shakes! Finally decided to try \"burgers & fries. They have 4 sizes: small, regular, huge & enormous. The \"regular\" burger was pretty pathetic, the shape & size of a golfball, slightly flattened, served on a starchy, gooey, white-bread bun. Way too much bun for the meat, pitiful. (Can't imagine how tiny the \"small\" burger would be.) Toasting the bun on the grill might have helped, but not by much.  French fries were surprisingly tasty & hot, crisp, and well-seasoned. Luckily, the caramel-fudge milkshake saved the night!"}
{"text":"it's good for cheap fast and late food at night. but if you want to eat healthy and high quality food, hard to find some here. Caz I ordered milk shake and it's soo sweet like put the whole store's sugar into it"}
{"text":"If you are looking for cheap and fast this is the best place to go. If you are looking for healthy then keep looking. You get a good amount of food for a low price. I love their chicken tender sandwich tray with two sides if I'm extra hungry I'll get a chicken wrap as a side if not double fries will do. Plus you get a drink if you order a sweet tea you get a ex large one with the tray.  They also have great customer service!"}

{"text":"I love this Cookout. Its only 5 minutes from my apartment and I visit it pretty frequently for some delicious food. The staff's service is very consistent; my food always tastes fresh and fantastic, the milkshakes are PERFECT, and it's a very quick trip with low cost. I almost always order a big double tray when I come through, they have so many options for such a great value! I like to bring my husky doggy with me sometimes and he orders a big double with bacon and cheese. He's so happy to come through the drive thru and the staff is always very sweet to him. Thanks for such great service!"}
{"text":"So it's not the best burger I've had, but it's pretty consistent. Love the Carolina Burger with extra slaw. Serve coke products. And an absolute ton of shakes to choose from including my favorite the classic chocolate shake. Don't expect amazing service here, for its pretty slow and has a lack of excitement. Most Cookouts don't have inside seating. This one does. Dated though."}
{"text":"Great back yard tasting food at a very good price!!!  I love this place, and go here any chance I get.  All the food is great, and they have tuns of shakes to choose from."}
{"text":"Always yummy! Although the food is cheap, there is no slacking off in quality. The milkshakes in particular are outstanding (I usually get the mint Oreo)."}
{"text":"Is it sad that I'm sitting here to write this review so I can remember how good the peach cobbler shake was from Cook Out?    I should probably get in the car and head on over there again.  Last time I went there, which is 15 minutes out of my way, I had an excuse because I left my NCDL at a golf course.   Now, if I make a Cook Out run, that's just straight being a fattie mcfattie.  Hmm... I'll justify it by writing this review -   First thing I love is the double drive-through action that they got going on there.  It's like instant gratification pretty much.  Can't sit patiently behind the old lady ordering her quarter-pound cheeseburger, chili and slaw? I don't blame you, ain't nobody got time for that!  Go ahead and zip over to the right side so you can place your order.    Peach Cobbler shake - Get outta here. It's not a shake.  It's super-thick... (giggity)... The straw has no chance of being a straw.  Hoover vacuums don't stand a chance.  Cook Out employees know - they hand you a spoon and a smile.  Anyways, get the peach cobbler shake. It's cold amazing goodness. It's not tarty, if that's what you're expecting.  It's vanilla base with crumbles of peach cobbler pie that was sitting out on the windowsill and just perfectly cooled down.  Yeah, I think I'm gonna to the \"driving range\"...   dmo out."}
{"text":"I live in the birthplace of In-N-Out, so trying out other, regional burger places often leaves me sad. But Cook Out is the real deal.   Their burgers taste like..... beef. And the fries taste like ....spuds.  That shouldn't be a revelation but it was wonderful to enjoy a simple meal done right.  And the chocolate, walnut shake made for a delicious, unexpected surprise.  I'm comin' back Cook Out. I gotta try a burger Cheddar style.  2013 #160 / 365"}
{"text":"The workers need to be a little bit more friendly, food was good but when we ordered through the drive thru we repeated many times that we need lots of ketchup, we got not one ketchup. That was pretty aggravating cause I can eat my fries without ketchup my friends. Love the Banana milkshake though."}
{"text":"I can always count on my order being incorrect in some way. The staff is somewhat friendly but never seem to be able to get the order correct. The food is good and the prices are great. Just work in making sure orders are correct."}
{"text":"Ummmmmm 5stars .... Cookout never disappoints me . If I'm craving Cajun fries and a scrumptious, messy burger then you'll find me here . My fav is a cook out style burger tray with double Cajun fries . Let's not forget the mouth watering milkshakes *cookies and cream, please* only downside is most cookouts are always packed so if you're rolling through on a Friday or Saturday night you'll most likely see a line . I don't expect everyone to appreciate simplicity but you can't beat these prices and menu options for \"fast food\"  4/15 sorry cookout , you're  slipping , you're falling,  you can't get up.... the service here as taken a nose dive, and the seasoned fries are well not so seasoned. What happened? This will make three times , so 3 stars you are ."}
{"text":"Hello Friends,  Simply put, you can't go wrong with cook out food. Cook to order, and inexpensive.Never had a milkshake but it's their claim to fame. I won't waste time repeating what's been typed already.   I will say this..... Chicken club is my favorite. And this is prime location.  TTFN"}
{"text":"Hello friends,  Short & Sweet Nothing stands out (for the good or bad) for this location. Good food. I've yet to try the milkshakes.. and i don't really know why. I must try them soon.  Go enjoy, TTFN"}
{"text":"Since Yelp doesn't allow half stars, I am giving them 4 because 3 is just a tad too harsh.  Their milkshakes are fantastic and you can pretty much satisfy any craving you may have.  They have 40 flavors on the menu.  I am a big fan of their chicken strip, hush puppies and quesadillas platter.  The quesadilla does have a little kick to it, but it is SO good!  Hubs loves their BLTs.  He can eat like five of them at a time.  It's an issue LOL.  He also thinks they have good burgers for a good price.  My biggest pet peeve with the place has nothing to do with their food or their prices.  It's their craptastic speaker system and awkward two lane drive up process.  Seriously, I cannot understand a word they say on the speaker so I am forced to park and walk up to the window to order.  If I can't understand them, how can they understand me?  I want my order to be accurate so I go for the face to face interaction every time.  The two lane drive up works conceptually, but in the real world it sucks.  People are so self absorbed and on their phones half the time that it becomes a complete cluster.  Fender Bender imminent.  Repeat, Fender Bender imminent."}
{"text":"Went here on 10/8/17 to order a hot dog combo. I ordered onion rings as a side. I got 4 and 1/4 onion rings. The cashier also put thru everything individually instead of as a combo so I was overcharged by 2 dollars. I asked at the window if I had the combo price of 4.99 because I paid almost $8 and cashier got an attitude. You can't go inside to complain so I just left. Food was mediocre at best. Bunch of attitudinal young people working there. I can go better got the money. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Love this place. Love the walk-up diner feel. The service is fast, friendly and the food is PHENOMENAL. My personal recommendation is the Out West Style burger with extra barbecue sauce. Love the hush puppies and the coleslaw. And the SHAKES. OH, the shakes. Get the peach cobbler shake. I've had Cookout all over, but this is by far my favorite location."}
{"text":"The grilled chicken sandwich was OK. Tried the pulled pork BBQ sandwich and I regret it. You always get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"Fast food is fast food. This place has some good prices, way better than your average McDonald's. Quick service. It's a fun place to try every now and then. The milkshakes are very thick, so plan on using a spoon!!!"}
{"text":"This chain was new to me when I moved to NC.  It quickly became a favorite.  While I rarely eat fast food, you gotta have a few bad days every once in awhile, where u need something quick and remotely edible.    I always enjoy the cheeseburgers and hot dogs.  The hush puppies and even the fries are pretty good.  They have tons of milkshake flavors, and they are all fun to try.    The service here is usually fast and the orders are always correct.  The staff isn't overly friendly and sometimes hardly even say hello...but you get what you pay for.  We will just say, it is no Chick Fil-A when it comes to hospitality."}
{"text":"Picked up a couple of milkshakes tonight. When I received my order, one of the cups was double stacked. I didn't give it too much thought but when I got home realized the reason it was that the top Cup had had the bottom cut out of it. I'm assuming from the mixer. There where lots of broken pieces of styrofoam in the drink. That's ridiculous! If you screw it up, re-make it!"}
{"text":"Good food, terrible service. I've always had good experiences in Cookout. Good, cheap food. I went in today for lunch with my brother, looking forward to a milkshake. I got the combo tray and a milkshake. The food was nice and hot, good as always. I pulled into the parking lot and took a big spoonful of my milkshake. There were a bunch chunks of ice in the milkshake. I've never had this in the other Cookouts I've been to, must have been a mistake. I pull around with my receipt and milkshake in hand, and politely asked if it would be possible to have it remade, since it had chunks of ice in it. \"Sir, it's a milkshake, it's supposed to be cold.\" 'Ma'am, it has chunks of ice in it. I've never had this in milkshakes from other Cookouts.' \"That's how milkshakes are supposed to be.\" 'Is it going to be possible for me to have my milkshake remade?' \"No.\"  Extremely disappointed in the service here. I would go elsewhere, because if they make a mistake here, you can expect them to blame you for it and refuse to fix it."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 Cajun chicken sandwich trays with and two drinks... The order wasn't 100% correct, but i can get over that..  The experience wasn't the best while waiting for my order.... I could hear screaming/yelling Over the mic while my order was being taken (which made my order difficult to get for the employee working - so i had to yell my order). As i pulled up the employees where playing around inside the store. (Hitting each other and goofing off..) After receiving my food i sat there for a while, waiting on my drinks to be handed to me. I had to unbuckle my seat belt and bang on the drive threw window to ask for my drinks while the employees where playing around and shoving each other (just to get their attention)....   The food is great (regardless of my order not being completely great)... but the experience with staff sucks..."}
{"text":"Me: May I get a BBQ bacon burger  Cashier: Do you want cheese on that? Me: No and no mayo, no pickles, & no onions.  Cashier: *sarcastically* \"So what DO you want on your burger other than bbq sauce and bacon?\" Me: That's it.   Pulled around to pick up food and I get a burger with NO bacon and cheese on it.   The service speaks for itself.    #UNSAT"}
{"text":"When I found out a series of misadventures would mean that I wouldn't be heading stateside for Christmas this year, I was pretty sad that I wouldn't see my family.  But when I also realized it would be MONTHS before I'd wrap my mouth around a delicious chili burger from Cook Out, I was plain devastated.  We always avoid the drive-through and just eat inside - the dining area is always clean and tidy, plus it's a nice break on the drive from the airport.  A North Carolina institution - need a Cook Out in Australia!"}
{"text":"Even though there is usually a long line, there are two drive thrus which helps a lot. Also you can get a lot of food for cheap. I love the milk shakes."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad interaction at this location. I've always got what I ordered in a timely manner. I love the combos. The prices are just right. You can really get your money's worth here. It is also a good place to go to get some of the best milkshakes in town. I am partial to the strawberry cheesecake milkshake. These are a good late night treat."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! The milkshake menu is incredible, offering over 40 different options. If you choose to mix flavors, they are fine with that.  Everything I've tried here, from a blt wrap to a blueberry cheesecake milkshake, have been exceptional from a fast-food restaurant. The blueberry cheesecake had chunks of cheesecake with a graham cracker crust in it. Needless to say, it was worth the calories!"}
{"text":"I went there yesterday and ordered a chocolate/cherry shake and a half-pound burger. I gotta say the shake was dynamite, but the burger sent me howling for mama! Never in my life have I had such a dry crumbling burger. It almost, no, it actually did fall apart in my hand,  I'll never order that again, but I do have to say the shakes are worth getting...again and again!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating Cook Out and it was awesome! Only down side to this location is it's either drive through or order at the window & sit in your car. Nice staff too."}
{"text":"So far everyone  that ordered before us has gone up and complain after the people have asked for their money back... Got to love the restaurant business"}
{"text":"I love cookout but this location has awful service. They forgot 3 of items and by the time I realized I was already long gone. Won't be coming here again. Stay away!!!!"}
{"text":"For cheap fast food, Cookout really is top dollar.  The food isn't gourmet by any standards, but for the value it's pretty good.  The value tray they promote really is an entree plus 2 sides and a drink (shakes for $1 extra) for $4.99.  You really can't beat it.  Granted, chicken nuggets are only 3 and so is the onion rings but include that with a burger or bbq sandwich or a dozen other items, you will be stuffed.  I share w my kiddo and the amount was perfect.  Also, the customer service really was great.  They actually wanted to help and serve!  Not too shabby!"}
{"text":"So glad cookout is here!!! By far the best lunch deal in pineville and food totally blows the competition out of the water. Since they have opened here I have not gone anywhere else for lunch.  Service is great and they always aim to please. Keep up the incredible work!"}
{"text":"Cookout is by far my go to on a late night or simply a night I don't feel like cooking. Or when I'm hanging with friends and don't feel like ordering pizza. Or when I just get back from a flight. Really I don't need an excuse to go because it always hits the spot.   This is the closest cook out to south end so when I'm down there hanging with friends this is usually our go to spot for a quick dinner. This location is fast with orders and the staff is good. They reversed an order once for me and gave me a beef quesadilla instead of chicken so that's why I gave it 4 stars. Chicken is by far the superior and I was sad. Hasn't happened since so I have forgiven them."}
{"text":"This cookout was my home base in college and 3 years after I'm still hitting this cookout up when I'm in the area. I've never had an issue with this location.   It can get busy in the evening. Weekends they stay busy well into the night. The reason they stay busy is because the food is good and worth the 5 dollars you pay for it.   Nothing beats a tray from cookout. Hits the spot every time. Check out their shakes too. Traffic has been an issue for awhile here but hopefully with the end of light rail construction things will improve."}
{"text":"Good stuff. Cookout style is life. Always delivers in the late night. Be ready for a line though."}
{"text":"It's hard to turn down a cookout milkshake. With so many flavors and the ability to combine them as you like, it's easy for everyone to find something they want. Make sure to get a spoon though, they're really think and you won't be able to drink it with a straw. As far as the food goes, I've never been a huge fan of it. If you're looking to get a ton of food for $5, this is your place. You can get a quesadilla, chicken fingers, or a corn dog as a side. It's pretty standard fast food though. Personally, I'll always pick Arby's or Chick-fil-a for fast food over Cookout."}
{"text":"THE best fast food at the best prices any where! Where else are you going to get a hamburger, footlong hot dog, chicken sandwich ect with 2 sides and a large dring or huge tea for $3.99?? No  where, thats where! Hambugers in sizes 1/8th up 1/2 pound to fit any appetite. I like mine steak style with grilled onions, lettuce, tomato mayo and A1 sauce. Good foot long hot dogs as well. Try it cook out style with mustard, slaw chili and onions. Plus a good BLT for just a buck!  We have never had any of the chicken sandwiches here, but heard from our daughter that they are very good too. Good sides as well, I like the hush puppies the best and who lets you get a corn dog as a side? Cook Out does! Plus crushed ice for the drinks, extra brownie points for that! The only thing I have tried at Cook Out I do not like is the BBQ, being the smoke my own, Eastern NC style BBQ purist that I am, so we'll let the 'Q slide. My wife and I go at night some times after dinner just to get a milkshake! 40+ flavors that are thick and creamy and yummy! I rarely give a fast food joint 5 stars, as a matter of fact, I don't think I have ever given a fast food joint 5 stars untill now! If your out and about and get hungry and want some good food at a price that won't empty you wallet, then Cook Out is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Best milkshakes ever Peach Cobbler, Banana and peanut butter, cherry cheese cake, push up pop, and watermelon try them all"}
{"text":"Always quick and always accurate with my order! Sweet tea, burger tray for the win on a drunken night!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a decent meal at a great price cookout is the spot for q fast food! You can get a cookout tray and a drink for less than $5.00.  Be sure to check the display board to see what specials they are offering. They usually have a featured flavored shake to tickle your taste buds!"}
{"text":"Cookout is a great spot for fresh food on the go!  I love to mix and match their cookout tray, where you choose two delicious sides and a drink, you dive a few feet to the pick up window where your food has out fresh and hot!  The cheese fries and the seasoned fries are both great and the shakes are so thick and creamy you can't even get it through the straw! Oh and the huge tea is just that a \"huge tea\" sweetened just right!   Great place for fast food on the go!"}
{"text":"omg omg omg!!! truthfully I fell in love with Cookout on a visit and it was the location near Banner Elk Drive.... but this is the location which is closer to where I live so ... its become my go to burger joint. The burgers and the chili taste delicious. I order everything Cookout Style ... and with cheese....   Omg - the shakes... i ordered a shake : Peach Cobbler... Peach freaking cobbler shake.. only in the south do you get to drink peach cobbler... mind you it was easily 90 degrees that day and my shake barely even melted on the drive back home.   I really cannot say enough great things about this place.   However... this particular location does not have the same taste as the location near Elk Banner Dr.... it seems a little lighter.. or a little less flavorful... but its still cookout which is damned Divine!!"}
{"text":"Food is great but the staff at this  location isn't as courteous as they should be.    Also, They also have a 94.5 cleanliness rating which is disappointing.  I would suggest one of the other Cook Out Locations."}
{"text":"You can't get much better if you want fast food.  Great greasy food and awesome milkshakes.  Get the tray and add one of their many delicious milkshakes for only a dollar and you will be in heaven.  I don't feel the need to recommend anything b/c they have so many options that I am sure you will find something that peaks your interest."}
{"text":"Top five favorite fast food spots.  I especially enjoy it if I can get a quesdilla as one of my side items, but only certain stores provide this option.  It is a must to get a tray here and add a milk shake for only 1 dollar.  I prefer the chocolate peanut butter milk shake, but with I believe 52 different milk shakes you can choose whatever catches your eye."}
{"text":"I have been to several Cookouts in the area. The food is also pretty good or as expected for fast food and I think Cookout has very reliable prices. This location is one that you can actually sit down in which many are not. The service was quick however the customer service was nothing special just ok. This location is by a bus stop so I noticed several people stop in who are not patrons just to plug there phone up and chill. Restaurant was also clean."}
{"text":"I just stopped in for a quick bite and two hot dogs and a sod and fries for 6.00, that was the treat. Everything tasted great. There was a huge puddle in the restaurant that had a cup floating in it , but other than I woudl have liked to see the place neater, it was good"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the food.  It's cheap, and when you are wanting a quick bite to eat, it's very convenient.   The only thing that prevents me from giving this place 5 stars are the containers.  Every time I order something hot like fries or onion rings, it will be put into a foam container.  By the time I get home, my food has melted the container, and on some occasions my food has stuck to the melted foam. I'm not some environmentalist, but I do know I don't want to ingest melted foam in my food.  I get it... the containers are cheap.  But, I wouldn't mind paying an extra 25 cents for a better container that wasn't going to melt and possibly be bad for my health.  The shakes are awesome, btw."}
{"text":"They get 5 stars just for having such a wide variety of milkshakes.  I think we were told there are 200 different flavor combinations.  What?  I mean that is just overwhelming.  I have never had a meal at cookout but I did have the pleasure of trying one of their shakes this past weekend.    The orange push pop milkshake tastes just like an orange push pop.  Remember those?  Such a refreshing treat on a hot summer day.  It will definitely take you back to your childhood as well.  Yummy yummy!   When a smoothie just won't cut it and you have to go a little bit more \"dirty\"...check out the shakes at Cookout.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Second time I have come to this specific location and either A. They forget parts of my order, or slack on the normal stuff. I get 3 burgers 1 large fry and and a drink. No Straw, and no napkins and the burgers were just slapped together.  The first visit we went there specially to get some cajun fries and a shake. Got home and the fries were just regular.  I have had better experiences but this location needs some double-checking for their orders."}
{"text":"Really poorly run. Stopped by today and ordered a 1/4 Reg. Hamburger tray. Was told the price and it was higher than listed, so when we got to the window and asked it turned out that she had added cheese without us even mentioning the word cheese while ordering. They finally figured out how to fix the amount due, but guess what....arrived home and found they never changed our sandwich...it has cheese. I think it is a scam to add the extras on and see if people catch it. What a racket....never again."}
{"text":"Terrible food, puny burgers that look a week old, hard over cooked chicken nuggets, a definite do not return!"}
{"text":"So, I did not order any food here at cook-out, but I had to write a review to holla at those milkshakes!!  40 different flavors that you can mix and match. I ordered mint chocolate chip with M&Ms and chocolate sauce and turned my night into a party!  They aren't huge but they are very reasonably priced and delicious."}
{"text":"Cook Out is one of the best regional fast food chains I've ever had the experience of trying.  Cook Out is inexpensive, great food served quickly with a smile.  And the variety of food is amazing.    Trust me on this -- the \"tray\" at Cook Out is the best fast food value anywhere.  Your choice of entrees (and there are quite a few), two sides, and a drink for under $6.    When you combine that with the variety of food, shake flavors, and late hours, there's no better option out there.  If there's a downside at all, it's that most of their locations are to-go only."}
{"text":"Located near Charlotte University City Area. We discovered Cook Out late one night after attending a concert at the nearby Verizon Wireless Amphitheater. It was after midnight on a Saturday night and as I drove by I noticed that Cook Out was really, really busy, that's often a good sign so I flipped a u-turn on Tryon St. and we pulled in to one of two drive-thru windows, since there was no indoor area.  I ordered a \"Huge Burger\" and upgraded to \"Cheddar Style\". It turned out to be an excellent choice. A half pound double cheese burger with bacon and grilled onions. It was an excellent burger featuring 2 smaller but thick and tasty patties delivered piping hot. I was surprised that the cheese was a sauce, I believe a good real cheddar would be better, but I still enjoyed it. I also sampled the Hush Puppies, a corn fritter inspired finger food, the Hush Puppies were very good. But the highlight of the late night meal was the \"Fancy\" strawberry/banana shake, it was just awesome!  I'd recommend Cook Out to good friends as one of my favorite reasonably priced fast food restaurants, especially for late night munchies."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why I haven't tried a Cook Out before today. That was a mistake. It's good. Seriously good. Burgers and hot dogs and especially hand-made milkshakes are unlike the other fast food places. There's just something about grilled meat and melted cheese with cool vegetables on top of a bun. Yummy.  I chose their \"cheddar-style\" which comes with extra cheese and grilled onions and mayo. It's probably about the same amount of meat as a Quarter Pounder or a Double but it tastes completely different. I can't quite describe why - flame broiled? grilled? It's just different. I also got a corn dog because... well, because I hadn't had one in a long while. I think I'm good on corn dogs now for a couple of years.  There is a small outdoor seating area - your strongly encouraged to eat in your car though I don't recommend it as it seems rather drippy. More so than the nearby Sonic.  Two drive through ordering lanes. I was paying attention where others were not and I skipped ahead of about six cars by spotting the second lane!"}
{"text":"My wife has become addicted to the Cook Out \"peach cobbler\" milkshake. So when I was visiting her near Uptown, I popped over to this Cookout to pick one up. Firstly, this is a sketch neighborhood. I did not feel at all comfortable here with a \"bars on the windows\" vibe. But the Cook Out itself is a bright shining diamond in this rough.  As for the shake, she pronounced it \"meh.\" Unimpressed with not enough peach in it and the few bits were too small.  Note that there are TWO drive through lanes. The outside one is a bit complicated so if you don't get it, stick with the inside one."}
{"text":"My wife *loves* the peach cobbler milkshake and so when we were in this part of town and hungry, we hit their drive through. Not much of a wait at 3:00 PM, so we were immediately able to place our order (there are two lines, folks!) and pull around. The shake was deemed excellent with enough peach and cobbler in it to pass inspection."}
{"text":"The first Cookout that I've been to that has an actual dining room, which was different. I was going to just hit the drivethrough for a milkshake but the line was long and it was looking quite slow. Heading inside was the right move - I was back in my car and only a couple of people had been helped.  Peach milkshake = yum!"}
{"text":"Cook Out is great when you need a quick bite to eat.  Service is really fast and the burgers are made to order.  On this visit, I ordered a cheeseburger tray with two sides of fries.  When the order was received, there were maybe 8 fries included.  Of course, I had to send it back.  Typically, this location will fill my order without incident.   For the price, you get a pretty good selection of food.  There are $.99 chicken nuggets that I think are better than other fast food restaurants and the milkshakes are pretty good as well."}
{"text":"Cook Out is a place we frequent for a quick bite to eat.  Typically, I get the burger platter.  You can have it your way which is good for the finicky eater. As I was eating my burger, I decided Cook Out needs to upgrade.  Shouldn't a burger at a burger joint be something you want to talk about to everyone you meet?  This is not the case.  Mind you, service was fantastic (aside from a few gnats in the restaurant).  I think Cook Out should 'up' their burgers to be some of the best burgers you can get rather than serving up 'just burgers.'"}
{"text":"Food totally wrong, smart ass chick behind counter offered me a cup for asking for sauces"}
{"text":"always good always fast...been eating at this chain for years its the best fast food around.. ive had everything on the menu just about and never had a bad meal. if you like milkshakes you cant miss one from here...yummo!! ....they will make it however you want it with in reason... just ask... you dont have to stick to the menu here, if they have it, they will put it in your shake.. :) awesome food for the price!"}
{"text":"I've gotta tell ya, I'm a Cook Out junkie!  There was a time, back in my fat boy days, where I would hit the Cook Out drive thru almost daily!  The prices are great, the food is great and for crying out loud they have milkshakes!  Fat Shane thought it didn't get much better than that!    The Cook Out \"Tray\" is a great deal!  There are endless flavor options to tickle your milkshake fancy.  The double drive thru makes for extremely fast and efficient service.  The staff is friendly and only once have I ever driven off with an error in my order.  Once is great considering how may times I've been there and it was an easy mistake to make.  I ordered a chocolate chip milkshake but was mistakenly given a mint chip milkshake.  It happens.  All good.  Head straight to Cook Out for some of the best BBQ, hot dogs, milkshakes and burgers around!  Coot Out was new to me when I moved to NC years ago and I even got my family hooked on it when they would visit.  It got to the point that they asked to go to Cook Out as soon as they got into town.  Now, just within the last 4 months, a Cook Out has opened in my hometown of Portsmouth, VA.  There are a lot of happy people in P-Town now!    Milkshake Tip:  You aren't limited to the flavors on the menu.  I like to make my own.  They offer chocolate chip and they offer cappuccino.  I get cappuccino and have them add chocolate chips.  Viola!  Java chip deliciousness!    I've had to steer clear of the Cook Out since setting out to live a healthier lifestyle but I still treat myself to a milkshake and a hot dog from time to time!"}
{"text":"Stopped here yesterday for lunch while house-hunting in the area. I had never been to the chain before, but I had heard it was good. Not only was the food high quality, but the price is ridiculously low.  They have burgers, hot dogs, and bbq. My wife and I each had a burger. You tell them what size you want (1/4 or 1/3) and then they ask you what you want on it, so you get to fully customize it. No need to ask if there's tomatoes on it, and if there are to ask to take them off, or to go back to your seat and pick them off yourself. Their combo meals are also insane, as you get a burger, drink and two side items. The sides range from what you would expect (fries and onion rings) to the unexpected, like hush puppies, corn dogs, and chicken or bacon wraps. The best part? The burger combo cost only $4 and change. There was so much that my wife just got a burger, and we split the sides from my combo and had plenty to eat. We ended up spending less than $8 for the two of us to eat lunch.  As far as the burger goes, it was good, but not the best. I find the burger quality at Sonics and some other fast food joints to be slightly better, but it doesn't mean this burger was the worst I ever had. For the price and the novelty of selecting from various odd sides, as well as the ability to order one of over 30 milkshake flavors if you so choose, it was a decent place to grab a burger on the go."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness the milkshakes! My boyfriend just took me here a couple of days ago for so late night munchies and man was I impressed..   The banana pudding milkshake was to die for... It was so hard to choose, everything looked so good.   The Cajun fries were yummy and the hush puppies were delish too.. Definitely coming back here since it's walking distance of the apt. Hope there's a gym nearby too lol."}
{"text":"Combos are a great deal!!! I I upgraded to a yummy hot fudge shake! Love the music they play! We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is a review on the drive thru staff. I don't really expect anything crazy from a fast food chain, but okay, what! So we go and pay for our two shakes, and we needed $4 back in change (yes I pay in cash). The girl comes out and says \"I only have $3 bills, is that okay? ...or do you want another dollar in quarters?\" I can't. It'd be funny if she were joking, and honestly we're laughing about it now, but I don't know who wouldn't want their change! Just thought I'd share!  Other than that, Cook Out is Cook Out. Good corn dogs, amazing shakes, and fiancé is the #1 fan of the quesadillas!"}
{"text":"This cookout has great food, the service is always extremely quick. It's a burger joint, so expect fries and burgers. It's your typical fast food place. I recommend the cookout tray. If you're in a hurry, stop by here and grab some lunch. For the price you get a ton of food!"}
{"text":"Decent for fast food . Nothing to rave about, but good if your in the mood for a greasy burger and milkshake ."}
{"text":"I've lived down south for almost 20 years and had never been to a cookout. I heard people rave about it in college and the drive thru line at most locations is usually busy. I decided to give it a try and I ordered chicken fingers, fries, and hushpuppies. I asked for a side of ranch and ketchup. First, the fries: they were semi-warm, mushy and tasted old like they'd been made hours ago, and they weren't salted. The chicken fingers were 20% mealy and stringy chicken and 80% hard & almost bitter tasting breading. The hush puppies were alright, those are pretty tough to screw up. The ranch dressing had a very oily/chemical taste. I had a few bites of everything but couldn't finish it and I felt pretty ill for several hours after eating there."}
{"text":"If you're coming here after 2:30am, don't expect your food to be fresh. I got food poisoning from here Sunday morning. I got a chicken strip tray double Cajun fries. Nothing was hot. The fries were soggy and the chicken was dry and I can tell it's just been sitting underneath a heating lamp. I work in the restaurant business and believe me, it only takes one bad experience to ruin a reputation."}
{"text":"Loved this place for years but not today, I found a big piece of PLASTIC in my milkshake. It was sitting right on my spoon in the cream. I don't know what's going on behind those shady-dark tinted windows, but I did not ask for a Plastic and Cream milkshake. Probably my last time getting a milkshake from there and as hard it is to say it, this will probably be my last visit. It is good but its standards cannot be trusted, IMO. I want to live."}
{"text":"This place can be dangerous.... for the waistline.  I have a lot of fond memories of Cook-Out near college and late night runs.  This location off of Sardis Rd... used to be a backyard burger but it has been converted (for the better).  Probably the first Cook-Out I have seen that has indoor dining space.  I still have yet to try the indoor space, but the drive-thru is great.  It is a bit tricky coming in and out of the parking lot, but the cravings will help you navigate the curbs and corners.  You know a shake is good when it is so thick you can't even suck it through a straw!  They are even prepared and give you a plastic spoon to eat it with.  I guess the shake is more of a glorified ice cream served in a tall cup... but it's still great none-the-less.  Finally tried the indoor dining room!  Awesome.  I especially liked the worker who handed me my strawberry cheesecake shake.  She told me it was made with \"so much love.\"  I could tell by the way I practically inhaled it.  I made it a point to tell her how good the shake was on the way out."}
{"text":"Cook out is a great alternative to the same old fast food like mcdonalds! They pride themselves on their food being more like what you would eat at an actual \"cook out\" (get it?).   My favorite item is probably the corn dog! Can't beat it for 99 cents when that craving for a corn dog hits. My favorite side item is the hush puppies and the only one worth getting - the fries and onion rings aren't that good in my opinion! They also have a pretty good grilled chicken sandwich.   The only thing that I would complain about is the menu. I think it's confusing and difficult to read/order from the first time you visit. If you have never been to a cook out it may be overwhelming. I would suggest looking up their menu online first. If you are in the mood for a milkshake the list is pretty extensive and I'm sure they have your favorite flavor!"}
{"text":"Are you in the mood for a burger? Maybe you want chicken nuggets? Or maybe you are in the mood for a quesadilla? No a corn dog.   Let me blow your mind. You can a burger and get a two sides and they can be nuggets or quesadilla or a corn dog or other typical sides of fries, onion rings, slaw or hushpuppies.  Okay maybe not so mind blowing for people who grew up with a Cook Out but for someone who relocated from the West Coast, I had never seen such a thing. For around $4 you can get a tray and choose from burgers, bbq sandwich or whatever and have a great meal.  I can actually feed my family of 3 for around $12 and that makes me very happy.   I love their pork bbq sandwiches. They have a simple blt sandwich for a $1 and that makes my belly happy too. Their shakes are killer too.   Fast food eats on a very affordable budget."}
{"text":"Glorious day!  Cookout makes its way near south Charlotte and is better than ever.  If you've been to cookout previously, you might be familiar with the drive-thru set-up which was always the biggest annoyance for me.  I love the idea of super cheap food with amazing side items, but was driven away by the lack of indoor seating to provide me with warmth, rain cover, and lots of free soda refills.  Well Cookout heard my cries and built a mega Cookout in Pineville filled with dozens of seats and 2 full soda machines.  Hallelujah!  If you've never been to cookout, here's the run-down.  For $4.69, you get an entree (typical fast food fare and more - burgers, spicy chicken sandwich, pulled pork sandwich, chicken quesadilla), a soda, and the super kicker - 2 sides from an incredible list of choices.  We're talking about a corn dog, a cajun chicken wrap, more chicken quesadilla, chicken nuggets and so much more.  Of course you've got your standard fried fare like onion rings, fries, even hush puppies. It's like 2 meals in one.  For less than five frickin dollars.  Considering combos at mcdonalds and taco bell are now $7 these days, it's the best value in fast food, bar none.  The food itself isn't particularly remarkable but perfectly satisfying.  And for $1 more, you can switch out your drink for a milkshake, choosing from about 40 different flavors that they're happy to mix and match for you.  For instance, my recent personal creation was a cappucino peanut butter fudge shake.  Delicious!  If you've never had the pleasure, I'd recommend you come on by.  The Pineville cookout has plenty of room for you."}
{"text":"This is the best cookout ever! Always ready to serve weather it is 3:30am or 1pm!! They cook amazing food even tho it isn't extremely healthy, it is extremely delicious! I don't know why people go to fancy restaurant when cookout serve $5 for some amazing red!!!!! Please give them a stop by and try their food because it is so good. So good. So good. You can take a date here or just a friend, this is such a great place and deserves FIVE stars!3"}
{"text":"I have been going to cookout for two years now and I am always satisfied. The burgers are so good and the Cajun fries are amazing. If you like hush puppies, cookout is the place to get them! Their milkshakes are hard to drink through a straw, but if you use a spoon it's like soft serve ice cream. Cookout is perfect for those late night hunger cravings or a fast lunch or dinner option."}
{"text":"Beyond frustrated with this location. The food is good and made well, but I would love if they could get my order right just once!! The last two times we have went, my daughter was looking forward to a surprise burger meal, the order was made wrong and in one case forgotten. With a very busy drive up location i don't want to hold up the line by double checking everything but I guess I have to now!"}
{"text":"I wish 0 was an option. I have been trapped in line for 30 minutes bc the speaker is broken and they didn't close the lane. 3 cars have made it through while they other lane has probably been 10. Whoever made the decision to leave the lane open deserves to be fired. Never again. Not so much as an apology at the window on arrival. Nothing just acted like this was totally fine. Total wait is approaching 40 min and still no food and all I ordered was plain hot dogs and chicken nuggets."}
{"text":"Terrible! Awful service. This is not my first time eating at Cookout. The onions were not cut the way they usually are, it was huge and at an angle. Completely inedible. A friend of mine ordered a chicken wrap or quesadilla type of meal, there was barely any chicken in it. When he went back to show him, they gave him 3 chicken nuggets to crumble and place in his meal. Very nasty service from the workers. I'm not one of those people who need my butt kissed from fast food workers but it was really hard to ignore the attitude. Never again."}
