{"text":"Tried the veggie burger twice already...sorry I haven't gone in earlier.  It's hard to find a decent veggie burger but this place has hit the nail on the head.  the onion rings are to die for.  Very friendly,  family oriented atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in the east end beaches. I've been probably 3-4 times since they've opened (less than a year I believe). I've had the Moo Moo with cheese and the Smokey and the Pig. If you enjoy fresh, juicy, ground on the premises beef this is your place. The fries are julienne cut and spiced to perfection.   Attention burger lovers, check this place out."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised! Love the secret sauce. Very friendly service and great burgers. Love the concept of ground on site. Saw them do it!! No frozen burgers here. Busy store but well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Yes they have a veggie burger!  It's not homemade, but it's the good kind that has a good hearty texture and flavour.  Then when you load on the toppings including house sauce and fried onions it's yum.  and $5.  Five bucks, people.  You can't beat that in your own kitchen.  Also had the greek fries with feta and tzatziki. Which are seriously immobilizing and I can still feel them 2 hours later but at the same time I can't wait till I can have them again.  It's a great little mom and pop shop run by a really sweet mom and pop.  And nice enough that you can enjoy eating there."}
{"text":"I drove to this restaurant after they told me they would be open until 9. At 8:25 when I got to the door they had locked it. The staff looked at me through the door and ignored me. I called to see what happened and they hung up on me. Unfortunately the food may sound good but no customer service. Sad to see a business start off this way after opening."}
{"text":"My favorite burger in the city! I had a cheeseburger and absolutely loved it!!! Reasonably priced and I'm looking forward to trying the poutine next time!"}
{"text":"I love poutine! I keep going back and ordering their poutine so they must be doing something right!"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of working across the road from this restaurant for 5 years. Prior to it being burgers and fries, it was a Greek restaurant (operated by the same family). Both were excellent, everything is fresh, homemade and they are always FAST. My favourite burger was always the tzatziki burger, the Greek salad is always a home run (simple but good). This is a family operated restaurant - husband and wife duo, along with his mom. They are always warm and welcoming. If you are ever in this part of the beach (or even if your not!), definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"Really great burgers and more recently had some french fries and poutine. Great comfort food and reasonably priced menu items. A little further down the beach but worth a trip for a good patty!!!"}
{"text":"Ding ding ding. Ladies and gentleman, we have a new neighbour champion: Bulging Burger.   What an incredible and tasty burger.  Had the moo moo and cheese and for $9 it was quite a treat.  My companion had a double burger with cheese and bacon, which he ate with no complaints  Fries were also good except a bit on the small size for 3.75  Overall 5/5 stars"}
{"text":"The price point was great  - $8 for a bacon cheeseburger with whatever toppings you want.  I wanted to love the burgers from this place but it was just ok. The burger could have used some seasoning as it lacked flavour. The onion rings were pretty doughy.  I would rather have a No Bull Burger on Kingston Rd."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the burger. Larger than most being offered at the \"gourmet burger\" places around Toronto. Especially for 5$. Fries were nice and crunchy and light on the grease. Only criticism, gravy wasn't the best. I find I get quite the bang for my buck at Bulging Burger and plan on returning soon!"}
{"text":"Spotted this place while driving through the Beaches. Then turned around. Glad I did. Was pleasantly impressed. Burger was made fresh, homemade and was huge! Fries were great and the milkshakes were awesome! Will be back...."}
{"text":"Good value ($5 for a decent sized homemade style burger). Our favourite burger place near The Beach. They made a good milkshake also. Not a fancy place, just good burgers with lots of free toppings."}
{"text":"The unsung burger hero of the neighbourhood.  Rarely busy because for some reason no one knows about this place.  Burger patties are made fresh and to order so if you're looking for your order to be ready in less than a minute then don't bother.    I prefer onion rings over fries however these are standard garden variety so would highly recommend the fries over the rings.  Although I asked if they use 'real cheese' versus the cheese slice, I was disappointed to find out that it was a plastic cheese slice which is a definite no-no for me......however if you don't mind go for it.  If you option for bacon you'll get two full crispy slices.  Lots of free toppings to choose from.  2 burgers (with cheese and bacon); 1 fries, 1 onion rings (of which there are plenty of both....no scrimping on serving size at all) and 1 can of pop was $27.86 including tax.  If you want to avoid the crowds elsewhere on the strip, then head here."}
{"text":"Eat here and get your burger fix now  Really enjoyed this place and the owners comes from Greek roots, hence the Greek flare ;)  Everything is reasonably priced, super fresh and down to earth.   I got the bulging burger and wife got the moo moo  The bulging burger rules ! It's like their version of the big Mac on steroids with 2 patties and 3 buns. Moo moo was super cheesy, but having had both, would go with the bulging, but that's just me. Patties were crumbly and moist and the buns were just the right texture. Fresh lettuce, tomatoes and mayo made the burger amazing  Fries were fresh and crispy and onion rings was quite a sizeable portion. Simple fresh burgers at its best. Will 100% be back"}
{"text":"Tried their Moo moo & cheese burger and The bulging burger.  They were huge and juicy. The meat was fresh also the veg inside.  Loved it. Craving for more once I was done eating the burger.  The bulging milkshake was not for my taste....  They know what they are doing. Recommend this place A+"}
{"text":"Little small family joint. Staff seem friendly, I went with their signature The Bulging Burger, onion rings and chocolate shake. The onion rings were pretty good, the burger was massive got the price and really juicy.  Over all a good meal. It's just milk shake that disappointed me."}
{"text":"We had the burgers April 11, 2015.  They were ok.  Probably the best burgers on Queen east of Hero Burger.    I had a few pieces of hard gristle in my burger which was off putting.  I found the buns to be toasted too much which made me think that maybe they were a bit stale?  The veggies on the burger were very fresh.   Would I prefer this place over Burgers Priest, or No Bull Burger or Five Guys?  Probably not.  But if I was in that area and looking for a burger I'd definitely go again."}
{"text":"Quiet little spot on Queen East at the beaches The Bulging Burger is probably the best burget joint in the area. Wasn't expecting this place to wow me but it was prett amazing. Not my favorite burger joint but definitely worth the price."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Would go again. Great time with friends in a Greek style burger place. Mom and pop feel, makes it intimate. Great view. Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Me and my partner love Bulging Burger and it has fast become our go to place in The Beach for burgers! Extremely friendly staff and great eats - you can't go wrong!   We have visited at least 8 times now and I always order the Greek burger which has feta and their homemade tzatziki on it - the sauce is great and really packs a punch! My partner usually gets the moo moo with cheese or the bulging burger. The beef is fresh and simple, it tastes very homemade and unprocessed. Nothing over powering for seasoning on the meat except some salt and pepper and I like that because after you add on the flavorful toppings it makes for a really well balanced burger. Good bun to meat ratio, it is always juicy and I have not been disappointed once in the times we have been! We also always each get a poutine or the feta fries with the tzatziki added. I don't love the fries as much as some other burger joints because I find them a bit thin and wish they had a bit more potato to hold up to the toppings on them.. but they are still fries so they will get eaten! The Poutine is good, lots of cheese and the gravy is dark which I like. The Greek fries have a generous amount of feta on them and I prefer them to the poutine personally. We typically finish the burgers and then take the remaining fries home for later as it is quite a large serving. My partner has also had the onion rings which he said were amazing.   We always dine in and there are a few small tables with some great window seats. After ordering the food typically takes about ten minutes to be prepared, so if you're hungry you won't have to wait long.  It typically costs me and my partner around thirty dollars with drinks and food. For the homemade quality and the generous quantity, I think the price point is well matched. They also have some wine and beer as well, but note that it's only a small offering with just a few choices.  Overall this is a really great family run place. We are never disappointed, always leave happy and will continue to visit at least once a month. Absolutely recommend!"}
{"text":"A great simple burger.  They don't try to over do it.  Prices for the simple burger is good value.  Prices increase rapidly with the other specially named burgers.    Stick to the simple one and load up the toppings.  Greek fries get honorable mention."}
{"text":"I asked my mom: \"how many stars shall we give him?\" And she said, enthusiastically, \" Five!\" - this is my third burger here and my family's first (they were visiting from the east coast). Highly recommend ANY burger !"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday and was pleasantly surprised. I only had the cheeseburger and my boyfriend had a double hamburger but they were delish! We also had fries and gravy and onion rings. Everything hit the spot. The cook did everything but he was very very nice! Take our order, make/cook the food so it took a bit of time to get our order but it was worth it. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The problem with the Toronto food scene is that there are too many chains serving overly processed food with additives and unknown mystery ingredients and not enough 'mom & pops' that take great pride into their product.  This is one of those places.  They stick to a small menu and from what I can tell so far...they do it well and they care that you like their food.  The place has only been open a few weeks and I wandered in after a very long bike ride...famished.  I ordered the moo burger(?) which had cheese, onions, lettuce, tomato, and two fresh ground beef patties.  Yes, ground on the premises.  Who does that anymore?  This makes a difference.  I also had a side of fries which were AWESOME! Fresh cut julienne fries that are crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  Have it with vinegar and a little salt.  Everything was fresh and delicious.  The beef patties were so fresh that it did not need anymore seasoning.  If they do put seasoning then they don't over do it.  Nothing worse than an over seasoned meal.  The place is small with maybe place for about 20 people, it is clean, and the owners are friendly and want to do a good job.  I will be back the next time I am in the Beaches area on Queen St. E.  Rated 5/5 for the fresh ingredients, good preparation, and beef patties ground in the restaurant."}
{"text":"The Bulging Burger is a nondescript burger joint on the south side of town. Located just steps from Lake Ontario on Queen Street, serving up delicious meat patties and fries is definitely their specialty.   Must-try item: Moo Moo & Cheese Burger  The Moo Moo & Cheese is absolutely delicious and priced nicely at just under $10. I thoroughly enjoyed the poutine and would come back here at least once in a while. The Beach neighborhood is home to this hidden gem, so taking a stroll down the boardwalk to burn off the calories is always an option."}
{"text":"Everything was so delicious and fresh. I am so full! Great prices. Nutella shake should be illegal! My chicken club was so tender and tasty. My husbands double bacon cheese burger was as good as we make them! The onions rings are thick and tasty and the fresh cut fries did not disappoint. We finally found our local burger joint! Service was excellent too. Fast, friendly and fabulously delicious food. We loved sitting at the window dog watching in this not so crowded part of the Beach. See you again soon."}
{"text":"SUPPORT SMALL BUSINESSES!  I feel like this place would have way more business if it was a bit further up the street. The atmosphere definitely gives off a family vibe without being too compact. There is plenty of seating although I was only 1 of 2 people there. I went with the MooMoo burger which was delicious if not a bit too saucy. The burgers are ground in house each day and you can definitely tell because of the great homemade flavor. I chose poutine as my side but could have done without it, I believe it would be much better with less gravy. They do take call in orders which is great for those that are busy.All in all this is a great spot on a quiet corner that should have way more customers."}
