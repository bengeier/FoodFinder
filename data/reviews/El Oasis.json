{"text":"This place has the best ice cream I have ever had!!! So good, definitely worth to try!"}
{"text":"Had the strawberry shake, it was good. Came up with a cherry, whipped cream and chocolate drizzle."}
{"text":"They have a great offering of milk based and water based ice creams. The portion sizes are really good! I think I tried the pistachio and my friend had the chamoyada. They were both delicious and different! It's definitely not your average ice cream. The seating is really cute, however, limited. The staff was very friendly. They also have other foods- I remember having a mexican sandwich which tasted pretty good. Their milkshakes/juices are also great! Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Seriously the best ice cream place I have been to so mAny flavors and you seriously don't have to be a kid to enjoy this. Wonderful customer service and plenty of seating great for large groups as we'll!! I had the strawberry cream paleta soooooooo good I bought 6 more to take home with me ! A must try I wish it was in a location where everyone could see It though it would be much well known!!!"}
{"text":"OH MY GOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Hands down the BEST dessert place in CU area!!!!! I'm so mad I just found out about this place. It is super clean, neat and the owners are really nice!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Super friendly staff and tasty, affordable treats. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"A must visit place in CU. The manager is super friendly and they have a good selection of icecream. Some are milk based and some are water based. They have interesting flavors such as avocado, cheese, spicy mango, tequilla, etc. They also do have normal flavors like strawberry, pecan, lime, coconut. Prices are not bad at all. They seem to sell shakes and juices as well. NOTE: You should definitely try tequila flavor."}
{"text":"My new favorite ice cream place. The guava ice cream was delicious, employees were really nice, and it was a pleasant place to hang out with friends for a while. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was inspired to check this place out based on other reviews and it did not disappoint.  First off we walked in and told the gentleman at the counter that this was our first time there.  He was incredibly helpful, informative and SO friendly.  We sampled some ice cream (I had to taste the cheese ice cream!) and ended up taking home some paletas.  After eating our paletas we wished we had gotten more!  Very reasonable and unique- I highly recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"Picture this: you're in a quaint room filled with chairs in vivid colors. Two children sit at a miniature picnic table, speaking to each other over popsicles as their parents eat ice cream. You sit in one of the colorful chairs, scraping a plastic spoon over the cold exterior of ice cream--an ice cream scoop that you come to discover, as you bring the spoon to your mouth, is the best ice cream you have ever had.   This was my experience at El Oasis. I chose the mango ice cream, which surprisingly had mango chunks in it as well. The environment felt like an eternal summer day, as if it didn't matter what time of year it was--no matter what, El Oasis will be a sunny place where ice cream will always be the perfect choice, regardless of the weather outside.   At the ice cream counter, there are two options: water based and dairy based. There are plenty of flavors for each; the main difference is that the water based ice cream has a refreshing, sherbert-like texture, whereas the diary based is creamy and decadent. The cost of one scoop may seem slightly expensive upon first impression, but one scoop fills a cup and you can't beat the quality.  I highly recommend El Oasis. If you're looking for something new and can picture yourself in the scene described above, this is an excellent place to go."}
{"text":"We go there all the time and have taken atleat 50 other people there. The escamocha candy is amazing.  The spicy mango is another fav. They have amazing flavors like tamari, spicy pineapple, maame. Can never get enough of this place"}
{"text":"I was pretty surprised by all the five star reviews on Yelp, but then I came here myself.  My wife and I got two tortas, along with a chamoyada and about 5 paletas to take home.  The tortas were delightful; made up after we ordered and with a smoky chipotle ailoli that really brought the sandwich together.  They were delicious and filling, so we ended up getting the rest of the ice cream to go.    We got a cup of the chamoyada, which was just awesome.  I'd never had it before and the mix of sweet, sour, and spicy is wonderful.  I think we got spicy pineapple and guava as the flavors, but the spicy sauce was the real star for me.    We also got several paletas, which were also very tasty.  There's some interesting flavors like cucumber, rum eggnog, and spicy fruit.    The staff were extremely nice as well.    Seriously recommended.  A perfect place to stop after a long week."}
{"text":"What a lovely little shop! So pleasantly surprised by how nice the servers were. And the chamoyada - oh goodness this is delicious!!! Fruit sorbet (watermelon, guava, custard apple) topped with a sour and spicy chamoy sauce. Slightly tangy, spicy, and sweet. Wonderfully refreshing!"}
{"text":"This is a very unique place with authentic Mexican flavors. I really loved the pinenut and mango rum with raisins!!! Worth trying people:-)"}
{"text":"friends.  I'm so happy I found this little gem in Urbana. I'm here for the summer and it's my mission to try every hole in the wall (and some nicer places) while I'm down here. I love hole in the wall restos but especially when they have great service AND it's clean!! El Oasis has both plus amazing funky flavors of ice cream and paletas (popsicle). If you're lactose intolerant or vegan etc you'll find something yummy here.  I got the jambon (ham) torta and it was fantastic. Like...I'm not a sandwich person and I killed it in less than 5 min! It was fresh, bread was soft not stale, spicy aioli omg...best part- it's under $4. I'm planning on living off this stuff now. Also tried the spicy mango paleta and I asked the lady owner if it's very spicy. She said not really. Lies. It was good but a bit too much spice for my taste (for a dessert). If you're not the adventurous type, they have normal flavors like strawberry, kiwi, mango, etc."}
{"text":"Awesome place. The cashier lady was really friendly and walked us through all the unique flavors they had. The gansito ice cream is tasty. I also tried the watermelon and thought it was okay. The black seeds in it kind of threw me off. My boyfriend got a strawberry shake which was really good too. I'll definitely be back to try more flavors!"}
{"text":"I went here a while back with high hopes based on the reviews I had read and was so disappointed :(   The service was abysmal. The lady serving ice cream was incredibly impatient with me as I attempted to choose what flavor I wanted... even though I was the only customer in the restaurant and it was the middle of the day. After I asked to taste a flavor (I saw the little tasting spoons so assumed this was a fair request), she abruptly stated I could only taste 3 before I had tasted any at all. That's fine; it's obviously not exceptional customer service to so adamantly limit the amount flavors new (or any) customers can try but I understand that they may have had their reasons for doing so. What really put me off was her attitude and how openly unhelpful she was being.   All that aside, I dealt with the discomfort of ordering from her and got a single scoop of ice cream. I wish I could remember what flavor(I want to say guava?), but the texture was so bad I couldn't even eat it! It was grainy and tasted artificial. Maybe it contained real guava, but definitely not fresh ones.   Based on the many positive reviews El Oasis has received, I hope that my poor experience was a unique incident. However, I personally cannot recommend it."}
{"text":"I love that they have the water based ice cream especially flavors that I love such as soursop, guava and prickly pear. It's not as sweet which works for me. Love the avocado ice cream. Chamoyada is another of my favorite and they also have nice snacks to eat. Just ask for the explanation since most of the menu is in Spanish. Owners are very friendly and polite."}
{"text":"Located in the corner of a strip mall behind a Walgreen's and in front of a car wash, El Oasis has some of the most friendly and happy-looking employees around. The store is pretty clean with lots of seating in front of a colorful, slightly weird and poorly drawn mural of palm trees on a sandy beach. The chairs are also brightly colored, and there's a little area with smaller chairs for kids.  There's a drive thru window on the side of the building - maybe a remnant from a previous shop? A bulletin board with Spanish ads and community information hangs on the wall behind the counter, just far enough that you can't really get to it from the customer side. It makes you wonder who it's for, since no customer can stand in front of it to read what it says.  While you're peeking over the counter, squinting at the words on the bulletin board and wondering why anybody would bother putting up flyers there, you feel a chill from the glass panel your hands are on. You catch a whiff of something spicy from the cup your friend is holding. You hear the nice lady behind the counter ask what flavor you want. Your heart skips a little as you rattle them off, not realizing what you've just said. No matter. It's the usual, the same thing you get every time you come here.  And when she hands you your pine nut, cheese, and mamey triple scoop of milk-based ice cream and your guanabana and spicy mango chamoyada, you realize that in this brief moment, in this small Mexican ice cream shop between the Walgreen's and the car wash, your life is complete. There's nothing better than this."}
{"text":"About 25 flavors of ice cream made from real ingredients and a good menu for snacks and food. Great prices and the ice cream is sooooo good."}
{"text":"had one of their ham tortas and it was on POINT! not to mention the esquite! super happy to have this in urbana-champaign. thank you!"}
{"text":"Absolutely stunning place with their ice cream! Every flavor was smooth and delicious. Guanabana, watermelon, mango and lime!!!"}
{"text":"I love it when I get to pull out my \"I'm from Los Angeles\" card! So here I am. I'm from L.A. which (obviously) makes me an authority on paletas. Bonus reason to believe in my authority: I'm Latina. Okay, okay. None of this really means anything so I'll get to the point. Their fruits/paletas/tortas are so fresh and delicious and amazing. The chamoyada is fantastic.   To the reviewers complaining about customer service due to the two sample limit: it's hard out in these streets. No one owes you infinite samples. I have a feeling you need to keep that life lesson near and dear to your heart."}
{"text":"O M G this place deserves so much more attention than it's actually getting!   I came here after a tiring canoe trip, and this was the perfect treat. I sort of had in mind that I wanted a paleta (Mexican for popsicle) coming here, but as soon as I saw what everyone else was coming here for, I knew I want to the chamoyada. Definitely go for the large size. You get to choose three of their water based Mexican ice cream (mango, spicy mango, lime, tamarind, or guava). The cup is coated with a chile sauce, with additional chile sauce and fresh squeezed lime juice between each layer. All of this gets topped off with diced mango. I chose spicy mango, tamarind, and guava for my cup. Guava is SOOOO good.   I'm obsessed with this place and their chamoyada now. We came back four days later at lunch time. The second time we went, it was empty so we got a chance to chat with the owner. Really friendly guy. He mentioned not investing in advertising at all, but this place is really a gem and deserves word of mouth advertising."}
{"text":"El Oasis is a wonderful little paleta/ice cream shop full of tasty treats and perfect for a hot day.  We sampled several of both the water and milk based flavors, took two paletas home for later, and were delighted with all of the offerings we tried.  We will definitely return and recommend to friends."}
{"text":"Great spot give it a try!  Quality, unique, creative flavors partnered with a friendly staff and sparkling clean operation.  Spicy pineapple was fantastic, can't wait to return and try other flavors!"}
{"text":"In a world filled with Dairy Queen's and grocery stores full of Ben & Jerry's and Häagen-Dazs, El Oasis provides ice cream flavors old and new that you are unlikely to find anywhere else in CU. Next to American staples like strawberries and cream, Oreo, and mocha, you'll see corn, avocado, and tequila. From what my Mexican girlfriend tells me, El Oasis offers an authentic Mexican ice cream experience. The various fruit and flavor combinations are unlike anything else. If you're not in the mood for ice cream, they also offer popsicles alongside many other dessert options. At the least, El Oasis is a must try for the adventurous or curious foodie. It is my new favorite ice cream place in CU."}
{"text":"La muchacha que nos atendió se portó muy grosera cuando nos especificó que había nieve de coco. El servicio muy malo"}
{"text":"Loved it. Good flavor, very tasty and made with fresh ingredients. I'll come back for sure."}
{"text":"So excited that we finally tried this place!   I've always noticed it but never realized it was an ice cream shop until recently.  The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, letting us try multiple flavors and answering all of our questions.  I ended up getting a scoop of watermelon which was delicious and refreshing and another milk based one of which I can't remember the name! My husband got spicy mango and lime which were a really nice blend of flavors.  We took home some paletas to try later.  I just had mango strawberry and it was light and refreshing.  Can't wait to go back and get more flavors and also take my mom who is lactose intolerant.  It's nice that she'll have so many water-based options to choose from!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots in Urbana! They have a wide variety of desserts and ice creams. I usually go with a paleta or fruit with chili powder. The folks that run the place are friendly and super-helpful!"}
{"text":"Delicious flavors. If you want fruit I've cream that tastes like fruit instead of sugar, come here. If you want to try some Mexican flavors like Guava, Tamarind, Cucumber, Passion Fruit, Chongos, Pineapple, Mango or even the spicy versions of them, then this is the place for you.   Honestly, it's amazing ice cream with very diverse flavors. I love this place."}
{"text":"Mexican ice cream with good reviews for a reason.  We had Gansito which tastes like a birthday cake.  Also coconut  and Chongos(Christmas Cookies) were both terrific.  4 scoops for the 2 of us came to a little over 8.  Yum"}
{"text":"Nice little frozen yogurt place. It has sooo many flavors to choose from. The texture is amazing. Loved it!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best place to get ice cream in town. They have such a vast selection of flavors that whoever you bring, everyone will find something they like. They separate their ice creams into two sections: water based and cream based. It's always nice to have that option. They carry all the basic flavors and so much more. My favorites are the corn and the rum& raisin. I like that several of their flavors come in regular and spicy like the mango and the pineapple. Don't forget to check out their house made popsicles display case where you can find some truly delicious treats like rice popsicles, cucumber, Oreo and more. The staff is always incredibly kind and attentive. Don't let summer pass without making a trip here :-)"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican style snacks and ice cream . Natural tasting flavors. Both classic flavors and their own more exotic combinations  Reasonable prices for such good quality and taste. Very relaxing environment."}
{"text":"This is just awesome place.. my first yelp review.. signed up just to say how good this place is .. spicy mango.. tamarind .. flavors you have never heard of. Too good."}
{"text":"Finally made our way out to El Oasis off Cunningham and University in Urbana -- their dairy-based coconut and the ganito (strawberries, vanilla, cake and chunks of chocolate) was absolutely delicious! Not overly sweet and perfectly creamy. For two big scoops, it was under $4.   My son feasted on the water-based watermelon and finished every bite. We cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Best place for authentic Mexican snacks and ice cream/shaved ice. Anything you can think of like Mexican corn or candy from Mexico is here. Very chill vibe and can't get enough of it."}
{"text":"I've been in town for one year and am angry that I just found this place.  The water based ice cream is explosive in flavor.  The torta was filling and fantastic.  And the people who own the store are so very helpful.  A must for anyone living or visiting."}
{"text":"For me, best frozen dessert place in town. Hands down. The owners are super friendly and their passion fruit and guava ice creams remind me of being a little kid again. Their ice cream is not overly sweet or heavy, but rather really refreshing. Also, since many of their ice creams are water based there are a lot of dairy-free options available!"}
{"text":"Been here many times. And always get amazing service (even as a gringo), if you're not sure on a flavor ask for a sample; the staff are always more than happy to dish out a sample. My first time here I sampled just about every flavor before finally deciding on a couple scoops.   Last time I was here was just a few days ago, I got a chamoyada with watermelon sorbet, so tasty.   The paletas (Popsicles) are amazing too just one look will tell you they are made with quality ingredients. The fruit bars have slices of whole fruit in them, and the Choco Bananas look simply amazing. Oreo bar? Has a whole Oreo in the middle of it.   Yep. This place deserves the 5 stars I'm giving it. And you should go and give them a try.  I'd say it's the best little-known hard dip ice cream place in town."}
{"text":"Corn and cheese ice cream. Omg. Amazing! I would have taken a large container to go but I didn't think it would survive the trip to Bloomington.  I would drive an hour for this ice cream. Hands down."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to go to El Oasis for the longest time. I finally got to go last night and I can't believe I waited this long!  El Oasis is located in a tiny strip mall at the intersection of Cunningham and University. It is easily missed by most, but it is a true gem. When you walk in, it looks like a typical Mexican restaurant with bright colors and a huge menu on wall. As you turn to your right, you see a three long freezers of sugary goodness.  El Oasis has a couple \"regular\" flavors such as Vanilla, Oreo, and Strawberry with chocolate swirl. They also have water-based ice cream which is more like a sorbet. They have many different flavors so you can enjoy some frozen treats if you are lactose intolerant.   The flavors that are less common are Guanabana, Gansito, and Tequila, to name a few. I would recommend trying something that you have never had before because I assure you, you will not be disappointed. The servers are very helpful in choosing what type of combination you would like. The owner is so friendly and very jolly which made the experience even more enjoyable.   El Oasis is a must stop place in Champaign-Urbana!"}
{"text":"Homemade Paletas! Delicioso! New & old flavors! Great place. I had strawberry with big ole strawberries & my daughter had the cereal one & it was pretty tasty! They also have ice cream & shakes with a Mexican twist! Very interesting flavors they have! I'll be back"}
{"text":"El Oasis is a wonderful Mexican ice cream shop. They offer water and cream based options. As a vegan, I have wonderful choices such as papaya, guava, passion fruit, etc. It is always clean and the price is right. El Oasis also offers Mexican snacks and food choices such as tortas. Not to mention that all the servers are nice and polite."}
{"text":"I've been here twice (not enough) and it gets better every time. Where else will you find cheese ice cream? El Oasis is clean and bright, the staff is great, and their selections are incredible."}
{"text":"Avocado ice cream. Do it. Also they have tamales in the winter. And add the flan/cake if you feeling good about yoself."}
{"text":"The Popsicles are so simplistic yet delicious! The price is very decent as well. If you want simple dessert that doesn't cost too much, this is the place."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't been here already. There are so many delicious treats. I started with all the tamales - chicken, pork, cheese (with bell peppers), sweet cream. Yes, I ate them all by myself & they were delicious. I also had the large esquites (like elote - corn with creamy aioli, lime, chili - but not on the cob). It was all quite filling. As if that wasn't enough, I got dessert. The coconut paletta (popsicle) had big chunks of coconut in it & the flavour was natural & refreshing coconut. So fantastic. Yea, I had more after that. I tried the ice cream in mamey flavour - a creamy fruit that tastes sort of like papaya.  When I walked in, the place was bright & beautiful, very clean. The staff was friendly & recommended flavours to try since it was my first time. They were also somewhat impressed that I ate so many tamales. Some of the offerings reminded me of the taquerias I frequented as a kid. Everything I tried was delicious. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time recently and it was a lovely experience. It was a typical gray gloomy winter day and the interior is cheerful enough to brighten your day. They have a large selection when it comes to flavors and have both milk and water based ice creams.  While I was standing all confused the very nice friendly lady behind the counter probably realized it's my first visit and gave me a walk through along with a few tasters. That pretty much made my decision harder cause all of them were delicious! I settled with scoops of pine nut and oreo. Now I can't wait to go back and try the rest of them!"}
{"text":"Oasis has opened up a stand in the mall near the carousel (food court area -- off on its own, among the tables rather than with the regular food-vendor counters along the wall).   We had two kinds of dairy-based Mexican ice cream (lower in sugar and fat, but with full flavor) in regular cones, the caramel and the pecan. The ice cream had a creamy texture and fresh taste. In addition to other dairy-based ice cream flavors, they had water-based, bars, and fresh toppings. We will definitely go back for more, and plan to stop by the main store in the future. What a nice surprise!"}
{"text":"Q: Where in central Illinois do you expect to find scoops of cucumber, corn, queso, avocado, tamarind, and spicy mango ice cream? A: El Oasis in Urbana  The only downside to my visit is that I could only try two samples of ice cream because as I solo traveler passing through I would have loved to try everything in the cases.  Wowza!  I've never seen some of these flavors in the form of ice cream before.  Five stars for creativity and taste!"}
{"text":"It's so amazing.... the mango ice cream we tried had real mangoes in it. You could taste the hair of the mangos"}
{"text":"The paletas are everything. They are the perfect balance of fresh fruit and sweetness. I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Very friendly customer service. Interesting options to choose from. Definitely worth a try if looking to branch out and try something different! I recommend trying their \"gansito\" ice cream...delicious!"}
{"text":"We are from Chicago and when we moved to town we wanted to find a place for treats like this. El Oasis always reminds us of home! Love it!"}
{"text":"The only regret you'll have is not having discovered this place sooner!! Their tequila ice cream is to die for. Besides the tremendous selection of ice cream flavors and Popsicles (both water and milk based) to choose from, they have a variety of sweet and savory snacks that are a MUST!  Personal Favorites: -Fresas con Crema(strawberries & cream) -Elote Preparado (corn in a cup)   Not to mention, they have ALL NATURAL beet juice, carrot juice, mango, gosh!!   Do yourself a favor and go here asap!!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine recommended  this place and I had to try it. They have water and milk based ice cream. I tried the pineapple which is water-based the strawberries and cream which is milk based, both of which were very tasty. The staff at the counter was very friendly and accommodating. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is the perfect place for an afternoon treat. The paletas are to die for! They also have a unique array of ice cream and sorbet flavors; you'll definitely find more than traditional ice cream flavors here. They have a few other Mexican desserts as well such as flan, chamoyadas and aguas frescas!  They also have some food dishes such a tortas but I haven't had any here.   Such a charming cute and colorful shop and the service is always super friendly. This place is definitely a stand out in the area!!"}
{"text":"I feel compelled to write a review for El Oasis because it's so freakin amazing, but part of me is hesitant because I want it to be a secret place of deliciousness for myself. Mine only. This place, though, is insanely good. I am Hispanic and grew up in Chicago where there are many, many paleterias to chose from--and oh boy, did I. Guava, pistachio, avocado, tamarind, water-based, milk-based..I grew up with all these flavors and options, and this place STILL surprised ma taste buds.  I went in and bought a pecan and caramel popsicle. I hadn't even reached the car when I turned around to buy five more and get them to go! Mine tasted like legit pecans, and had unfrozen caramel filling in the inside. How?? Magic."}
{"text":"Best ice cream in Chambana, hands down. Their tamales are fresh, made with quality masa, just like Nana makes (available on weekends). If you are hungry, try their tortas too. I love this place!"}
{"text":"I could go on & on about this place.   Where do I even begin? Well first off, this is hands down the best ice cream/paletas shop in town. With over 20+ flavors, all of them are homemade and fresh. They serve two different kinds of ice cream: water-based and milk-based in paleta or regular ice cream form. I love going back each time to discover new flavors.  I could eat the watermelon (water-based) ice cream for days on days on daysssss. (Not even joking.) It's like a little tropical summer paradise in your mouth. Guava + mango are awesome flavors as well.   Some flavors that I'd recommend:  - Paletas: Oreo, Strawberry Yogurt, Kiwi - Ice cream: Watermelon(!), Guava, Mango  Not to mention, but the owners are the best! They're SUPER friendly, consistent, and make you want to come back again & again."}
{"text":"Really great and unique selection of ice cream, and other frozen treats, as well as Mexican food, fruits and baked treats. I would recommend this over any of the other ice cream places; this is quite a find."}
{"text":"Bro, IT SO GOOOOD.  If you're not feeling the traditional ice cream flavors and are looking for a switch up, come to El Oasis. Its water based ice cream are indescribably unique and not toxically sweet like the average American scoop. A hidden gem of CU discovered!"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican treats. Great prices. They have a very interesting selection of flavors. Water and milk based ice creams. Both are very good."}
{"text":"This ice cream parlor is unique and fantastic.  They have all kinds of interesting Mexican style bars and scoops, with cool flavors like Pine Nut, Rice, Cheese, Tamarind, etc.  The people who run it are super friendly.  I couldn't decide which bars to buy, so I got about 6 of them and threw in the freezer.  All yummy!"}
{"text":"A hidden treasure of the CU area...in a quiet part of town but definitely worth heading out to. The staff is super friendly in explaining all the flavors that you won't find in American ice cream shops-corn, gansito, cheese, tamarind...They're happy to give out samples but only two per customer, otherwise you'd try every thing and get too full to buy a scoop. I've been there several times and have always been greeted with a smile. I'm always torn between trying something new or sticking with my previous order...every thing is so delicious. Recommend going with a group of friends so you can sample each other's flavors. They also have some food and snacks, like tamales, esquites, duros, etc."}
{"text":"The best place for cold treats in town. They have sundaes, popsicles, and ice cream by the scoop. I'm pretty sure everything is homemade. The popsicles are very impressive looking. They have ice cream thats milk and water based so if you're lactose intolerant, this is a great place to check out. Some of their flavors are quite savory and not overly sweet so if you're sick of the typical post ice cream sugar coma, this is a good place to check out. They also have traditional ice cream treats like banana splits that are definitely not for the sugar intolerant."}
{"text":"They have good ice cream but: 1. To be latinos, they have no manners. Latinos are characterized for their hospitality and charism. These people have no idea what is customer service. The guy was super upset because I wanted to try a third sample of different ice creams. He said no more than 2. I should have left. Instead, I ordered mamey. It was good ice cream.  My husband ordered tamarind soda with a cup of ice. The lady was yelling at him and made him wait."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem which is good in a way cuz I never had to stay in line! My favorite ice cream is their pine nuts and tequila! I tried the guava too and it was tasty.  My friend got the chamoyada (spicy mango ice cream, with mango cubes and spicy sauce) and omg omg omg it was so good! He didnt even like spicy but he loved it! All of the ice cream I tried are just at the perfect sweetness level. They also have options for lactose intolerants!! Definitely recommended altho I wish they could move to a better location!"}
{"text":"Yummy popsicles. Everything tastes fresh and natural. I love the chamoyada with spicy mango!!! Must go to ice cream shop"}
{"text":"I grew up in Southern California and was freaking out about finding tamales for Xmas here in CU.  El Oasis cured my homesickness with awesome chicken, pork, and cheese tamales for $1.50 each.  I had some New Mexican red chile sauce and avocado to eat them with and it was almost like being back home, at least for my tastebuds."}
{"text":"I had been checking reviews of this place from quite a long time, and so much wanted to go here but because of one or other reason couldn't go. Finally, last Sunday I had a chance to try out this place. They have a huge selection of ice creams and water based treats ( kinda like sorbet). I wanted to try all of them but my husband did not let me buy each one of them :(. After tasting a few, I settled on spicy mango, spicy pineapple, strawberry yogurt and strawberry. All for myself. I loved spicy mango and pineapple. It was like mango/pineapple mixed with crushed ice, chilly powder, salt, sugar. Tasted fresh and yum. Now strawberry yogurt and strawberry paletas were not overly sweet like usual ice creams, which I really liked. Both had pieces of fruits in them and they did not taste heavy. Loved everything"}
{"text":"I've tried the paletas here from Taste of Nevada (tried so many flavors in the past with mango, rice, and coconut). I've heard good things and have been wanting to check this place out!   The chamoyada is delicious! You choose two to three flavors depending on the size. I got a small ($3.69) so I chose two flavors : guava and guanábana. They let you taste it if you want. These are water-based sorbets but they also have ones with milk (but these can't be in the chamoyada).  It was absolutely delicious! It had spicy sauce and some mango on top with chili powder. The mix of flavors were great! They have a mixture of flavors like tamarind, coconut, and other tropical fruit. I will definitely try these again soon! It's nice to enjoy this on a sunny day!"}
{"text":"This place offers many creative choices of flavors, with quality ingredients. The owner was also very friendly and genuine."}
{"text":"Restaurant review Yes this is unique dessert place that has so many interesting ice cream flavors including cheese and corn. I think that many of the 5 star reviews are the novelty of having so many unique flavors with milk and water based ice creams. I really wanted this to be a 5 star experience, however after trying the Chamoyada and the ice cream; I just do not have a palate for this unique dessert. I pride myself on trying everything. I may have made a big mistake by taking the larger size of the chamoyada. I don't know how many flavors you get to chose because the lady never indicated when selecting so I ended up with the most \"popular\" the spicy mango and I made an additional mistake of choosing normal mango. The spiciness and season was crazy in a bad way. Somehow the ice cream was both salty, spicy, and some mild subtle sweetness. For the first time I could not finish my dessert. Something about the spiciness and saltiness made it very difficult to consume. It looks good on picture and maybe a favorite for some people, but I think I will pass from now on.  Pros: So many unique flavors, paletas with fresh fruit as well, friendly cashier  Cons: the blend of saltiness and spiciness is too much to bear. My son who loves ice cream simply refused to eat any of the corn ice cream  Hidden deals: None  Health code rating: A http://champaign.il.gegov.com/champaign/estab.cfm?facilityID=1988"}
{"text":"If you feel like some non-standard ice cream flavors, this is the place for you. I'm not adventurous enough to take full advantage of what they offer, but the tequila ice cream is pretty amazing. Recommended."}
{"text":"The paletas are delicious and under 3 dollars! Friendly service and the people behind the counter will answer your questions. The inside is clean and bright, and there's nice seating outside."}
{"text":"Went to El Oasis on a Sunday afternoon. This place spacious and clean with friendly and knowledgable people serving up authentic Mexican treats(smoothies, cake, chicharones, esquite, and more). I too tried the mango sherbet with chilli powder and it was delicious! I can't wait to go back. This place is awesome and reminds me of home. They also have non-traditional ice cream flavors the gansito and  tequila ice cream are must haves. Yes! Tequila ice cream, enough said."}
{"text":"The best ice cream in town. Just the right amount of raw ingredients, milk, and sweetness to take you to Dessert Heaven. Original and authentic flavors (i.e. Tequila). I always have to refrain myself from splurging. Popsicles have bits of fruit in them. They have cakes available as well.  It's a family owned establishment, the owners are very welcoming, and they don't mind recommending flavors! Finally, a place that isn't frozen yogurt."}
