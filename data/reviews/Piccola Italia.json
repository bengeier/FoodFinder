{"text":"Tucked away in a strip mall that has a ton of eating options, Piccola Italia is definitely worth a visit.  Walking in, you feel like you're in a 70's style pizzeria. Fairly impressive for a strip mall. The first thing I spotted was a stainless steel pizza tower on one of the booth table. It definitely brought back fond memories, as did the hot pepper flake and Parmesan shakers. Definitely the makings of comfortable restaurant for comfort food.  While the menu isn't gigantic (not a bad thing), there were more than enough choices, and tough decisions had to be made. I was very tempted to try the pizza, and while I was looking at the menu I caught a glimpse of the gigantic panzarottis served here. In the end I went with the Veal Parmigiana sandwich, with a side of fries.  The sandwich was gigantic and absolutely delicious. The bread was perfect and plenty of cheese, sauce, hot peppers, onions and mushrooms, along with a tasty veal cutlet. Truthfully, the sandwich would be two meals for most people, but I was happy to finish it. I definitely did not need the fries, but they were served hot and crisp, but not fresh cut.  The desserts looked amazing as well. I caught a glimpse of a piece of cheesecake that was tempting but there was no way I could have fit that in.  Next time I'm in Newmarket, I'll definitely go back and sample more of the menu."}
{"text":"Very expensive for what you get. $13.00 for a veal on a bun with no drink or anything else. It did taste good but not much veal on it."}
{"text":"Massive portions. Great selections of all pizzeria style foods. Fresh breads and great sauces *try the gnocci with sweet peppers and rose sauce*, a must have when dining in Newmarket!"}
{"text":"Just great food. Feels like Nonna is in the back cooking! The decor could be nicer....But it's a very small price to pay for such good food and a very nice staff. The panzo is enormous, the sandwiches are enormous, the pizza is seriously delicious. I've been to piccolo italia a dozen times and always look forward to the next visit."}
{"text":"I've been having lunch to go from here off, and on for the past couple of months. There is virtually no wait for takeout. Walk in, get a friendly greeting, place your order, and it is made in front of you.  Veal sandwich - tender and delicious. Nice sized portion. Mushrooms, onions, sweet/hot peppers, and cheese included. Served on a fresh italian style bun.   Meatball sandwich - oh my! Melt in your mouth. Same toppings, another beautiful experience.  Walk in xtra large pepperoni pizza special also available for takeout is huge.  Homemade crust, sauce, well covered with pepperoni, and cheese. You cannot get a homemade quality pie of this size anywhere else for $10 and change.  Excellent service, excellent food. Reasonable prices. See you next week."}
{"text":"We went in for a slice when and that's how we meet the very nice staff   they give us a great deal on a medium pizza and wings.  Pizza was great and the wings were hot and spicy.  Great food !   Thanks for the good deal guys! you will definitely see us again."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of a good italian sandwich and have tried many yelp recommended places but this place has the best sandwiches hands down. My favourite is a tie between the veal sandwich and steak sandwich. At $8.95, it is football sized and comes with the works: saut√©ed mushrooms, onions, sweet peppers, and hot peppers. Meat is tender and juicy and served on fresh Calabrese bread. A must try if you are in Newmarket!"}
{"text":"Amazing veal sandwiches!! I consider myself a veal sandwich expert and these guys have the best veal sandwich in Ont!!!  if you dare, add some of the best hot peppers in town to your sandwich. BTW, these sandwiches are HUGE...Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Truly a family-style, comfort food eatery.  This unpretentious Italian restaurant is friendly and very welcoming.  The portion sizes are huge!  We ordered one panzarotti between the two of us which started at $6.95 for the basic tomato paste and cheese.  Additional toppings (highly recommended) are 75 each.  We added in pepperoni, sausage, red peppers and mushrooms.  With an orangina drink and tax, everything was less than $15.  After ordering and paying at the counter, we sat down at a booth and the gigantic panzarotti was brought over to us already cut in half and served on two plates.  That thing was STUFFED.  The gooey cheese, the flavourful meats, the plentiful mushroom... everything!!  No skimping on anything here!  So good!!  Afterwards, I felt like there was a brick in my stomach, but I have to say that it was well worth it.  I've been told that the veal sandwich here is also enormous and highly recommended.  While we were there, we saw families sharing fluffy, loaded, huge pizzas and other foods.  Definitely bring a friend when you come here to share your meal with.  It is located inside a large suburban plaza where the parking lot is the size of a block.  Lots of random shops and restaurants here.  This restaurant is great and I would come here again."}
{"text":"We ordered a pizza from Piccola Italia a few months ago and really, really enjoyed it! We had our usual: pepperoni, mushrooms, onion and bacon (I especially like that they use real strips of bacon, not crumbled or bacon bits). The toppings were generous, the sauce was so good and the crust was perfectly crisp. The service was great too."}
{"text":"Its a family owned Pizza joint in a strip mall  Busy with take out pizza and slices  However, people actually enjoy the spaghetti and meatballs here as a sit down and thats a good sign  Tuck in and have some real home cooked italian food and enjoy a new york style pizza  No Marhgherita wood fired pizza here  I saw some stupid big Panzerottos there which i must try out. It looks like they took a whole dough ball to make it  Its dark, not fancy, smells like mommy's kitchen and thats what I want when i eat italiano  Nonna was off that day while the younger staff cooked away under sharp supervision by the owner so you know there will be no shortcuts taken  enjoy and recommended"}
{"text":"I've been doing this place for about 6 years now. It started with me hearing about the football sized panzerotti, which is exactly that big, no joke. Then after getting the same thing over and over again I branched out to the hot table and started getting sandwiches, sausage, meatball, veal, chicken... you cannot go wrong, the sweet peppers are cooked down JUST right, they almost taste buttery, its awesome. Then another branch out got me to their pastas, amazing sauce there.... GO TO THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"This is the pizza joint you grew up with.  Walking in the door elicits memories of youth, except the staff at Piccola are a lot friendlier than the old crusties from my past.  I ordered the Canadian pizza off of the specials menu rather than my usual custom-built, but requested a thin crust and minced garlic (which is a free topping on the DIY menu).  The crust was incredibly crisp, yet with good chew.  The toppings were excellent, especially the sausage which seemed like a deliciously tender spicy meatball, broken up into chunks.  You can stand at the front door and throw a rock and hit Pizza Hut across the parking lot, but PH will cost more for an institutionalized pizza and you won't taste the love that Piccola puts in.  My regular 8 slice Canadian was a comfortable meal for two, at $14.  Comparing price with my visit to Lemar's in Bradford, my Lemar's pizza was topped 4 times higher than Piccola, but I gotta reeeaally be willing to drive up to Bradford for pickup (not an eat-in restaurant).  So staying in the boundaries of Newmarket, Piccola is one of the best pizza experiences I have had in a long time.  I'll be back whenever the urge for grease wheel and nostalgia possesses me."}
{"text":"Lousy food and even worse service. Lasagna pasta was so overlooked it felt like I was eating glue. Switched up for chicken parm. Pasta was good and hot but rest of plate was stone cold. As soon as I mentioned something to the server she walked away to help someone else. Came back and asked if I'd like it reheated. By that point I was no longer interested in eating. The entree was still on my bill. Wasn't busy. Wasn't friendly. Won't be back. Very disappointed with the attitude more than anything."}
{"text":"This is a little hidden Italian place with great pizza and friendly service. The first time I went I was encouraged to get the special - homemade meat lasagna. After tasting it, I definitely expected more (not more of a portion, however - it was massive!). It tasted like it had been sitting out and the noodles were soggy. This was quite disappointing but the pizza is delicious and that does keep me coming back. The staff are very friendly and seem to enjoy being there and talking to customers. I do like that in a restaurant. I find myself ordering pizza from here every once in a while and I am always satisfied with the price and quality."}
