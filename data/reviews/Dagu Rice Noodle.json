{"text":"The soup is tasty, but i feel it's overpriced. I got the braised bone in pork soup and 2 additional items with the noodle. It ended up to be around $20. My friend had 3 additional items and before tip it was almost $30. You can easily get something really good at other places with this price just a few blocks west in China town. Because of the price, this will not be my go to restaurant."}
{"text":"I finally decided to brave the line and see what all the hype was about. I came here for lunch and had the pork bone soup. It came piping hot. (It was still bubbling in the heated bowl it's served in for a good thirty seconds after it was put down in front of me.) By the time I'd finished, I was dripping with sweat. The broth was not as flavorful as I had hoped, but it came with an unlimited serving of noodles. All in all not worth a long line."}
{"text":"The food is okay, and the drink is good! I love the tea with the whole lemon in it~ The service is alright, the food come pretty fast."}
{"text":"We came on a cold winter evening (Canadian extreme cold weather alert), and I have to say, I really liked this place. I don't get the negative reviews. They greet you warmly when you enter (basically like the Izakaya places), and our server went over the menu with us, explaining the items and patiently answering our questions. Our tray of side dishes for the \"bridge crossing\" was served in record time. Then followed by the sizzling soup. We tried the Sour and Spicy flavoured Crossing the Bridge rice noodle soup with beef slices, and the Signature rice noodle soup with braised bone in pork. Both were delicious, with the latter having a strong flavour profile of a well done broth. As others mentioned, they offered unlimited noodles, which was a bonus! Will definitely be back, especially for those chilly winter days!"}
{"text":"I give this place 1 star only because this is the lowest available, otherwise I would even give it a it a -1 star. Their service is one of the worst services I ever experienced. After I ordered my noodles, I had waited for 30 minuets without getting a single glass of water. Meanwhile, at least 3 tables came after me have their food served. During these times, I have asked 3 different waitress and waiters about my noodles."}
{"text":"Went to Dagu on Sunday March 4th, around noon, surprised that the wait wasn't too long, less than 10 minute wait for a table for 2. Unfortunately the positives end there. The customer service at this noodle bar was just atrocious.  Which is unfortunate, since we've been here about 4-5 times in the past, and quite enjoyed the meal here.   I'll start with the positives, the food we had was decent I would give it a 4/5 stars. We had 2 types of noodles and the crispy chicken.    The problem area for me is the customer service at this noodle shop.  I must have waited over 25 minutes for my noodle after my wife's noodle was delivered to the table.  My wife was almost finished eating her noodle, and I still have not received mine.  The table of 2 next to ours, they sat down 10-15 minutes after we had ordered and both of them received their orders before I did.    When I didn't receive my noodles after about a 10 minutes wait after my wife got hers, I asked our waitress about my order.  She mumbled that she will check with the kitchen.  After 5 minutes, she didn't come back, and I saw her taking orders and delivering orders to other table;  I flagged her down, and reminded her that I am still waiting for my order.  She then replied that the broth that I ordered(Classic mushrooms) was short in supply and will take longer.   This excuse doesn't make sense.  They pride on their broths taking 24 hours to make, so if its in low supply then they should stop taking orders for that broth, and tell me to order another broth.  Is she telling me that the broth is low in supply and they will be able to make another batch while I wait?    After another 5 minutes with no broth in sight, I spoke to the manager on duty, and she went back to the kitchen and immediately brought out my order.  Unfortunately, by now, my wife had almost finished her meal, so she have to wait on me to eat.  Kinda ruin the mood.  In summary, my big beefs: -  took 25 minutes for my order to arrive after my wife's order was ready -  guests that ordered after us, got their order wait before mine -  Waitress made a 'stupid' excuse on the delay"}
{"text":"I went here with my brother and we got the crossing the bridge noodle soup. The food was okay, but I found there was not enough meat (as a meat lover). The broth was not bad. The noodles were very tasty though!  This place is very crowded and the tables are seated close together.  Not bad, but I probably wouldn't eat here again. I prefer the chinese noodle place (Lanzhou Ramen) just down the street"}
{"text":"I visited this place last night on opening day and had a great experience. There was a bit of a line, but it moved pretty quick (20-minute wait). We were seated at the bar, where we were able to watch the drinks being made, which was really entertaining for us. We ordered the signature pork bone soup, the tomato flavoured crossing the bridge rice noodles soup, the salty crispy chicken, and the cheese watermelon drink.   The noodle dishes were delicious and filling. With the \"crossing the bridge\" varieties of noodles, they give you an assortment of toppings in a tray for you to add yourself to the broth, making it a fun experience, as well as customizable. Be warned: the soup bowl is VERY hot.   The pork broth was absolutely delicious- it was so flavourful without being too heavy or fatty. The noodles are delightfully soft; they have such a wonderful texture. The tomato soup base was very tomatoey, so if you don't like strong tomato flavours, stay away from that one. We both enjoyed it though.  The salty crispy chicken is basically like popcorn chicken. It was deliciously seasoned, and quite juicy as well. Not the best I've ever tried, but still very good. Not a must order for me for future visits, but it was enjoyed.   The cheese watermelon drink was full of fresh watermelon flavour. It was absolutely delicious, so refreshing, and a great accompaniment to the meal. We were not particularly fond of the \"cheese\" portion, but that's just due to personal taste; we anticipated that we wouldn't like it going in. If you like cheese drinks you would probably love their assortment. They also have a pretty wide range of other drinks on the menu, and they all sound absolutely delicious.   The service was great! At first, we were a bit confused as to who was supposed to use the toppings in the tray, so my friend used some of the beef slices in his soup. We asked for clarification, and when the server realized my friend had taken my beef slices, we were immediately given a refill on the slices. Above and beyond my expectations.   All in all, we had an amazing experience. I would highly recommend this place for people looking for a filling, delicious meal with a good price point. We will definitely be regulars at this establishment!"}
{"text":"First time here. Waited 10 minutes for a menu and had to grab one myself. Food was surprisingly awful. I mean I didn't even get a  tray with all kinds of sides, they put all sides into the soup already. And the soup was not that sizzling hot. Both the soup and the chicken drum tasted salty but not tasty. Huge chunks of pork in soup. I wasn't expecting that. I am pretty sure I prefer to eat at deer garden or fudao. 20 bucks is expensive for the awful food quality and service. I am not coming back."}
{"text":"My friend took me here as she found the concept very cute. I passed by the Dagu downtown before and there was a long lineup so I was curious to see why it's so popular.   The waiters speak Cantonese and Mandarin. When we spoke Cantonese to them, they would respond in Cantonese, but a few minutes later when they come over again, they would automatically speak Mandarin. It's like they have short term memory loss. I understand if it's very busy, but the place was half empty. It shouldn't be too hard to remember what language your customers speak. Also, the waiters aren't very attentive; it takes quite a few times to get a waiter to come over.  The marinated chicken leg ($1.99) was a tiny drumstick that was super duper dry. The meat was so rough it was like chicken jerky. I highly do not recommend this side dish.  The brown sugar sticky rice ($3.99 for 6 pieces) is a long mochi that is crispy on the outside and has a brown sugar syrup drizzle on the top. I love mochi so I thought it was pretty good.   The deep fried pumpkin pancake with red bean paste ($3.99 for 4 pieces) is a pumpkin flavoured pancake with red bean paste in the centre and is crispy on the outside. This one was not sweet enough for my liking.   The salty crispy chicken ($6.99) wasn't really crispy and not hot enough. Definitely not the place for popcorn chicken.   The passion fruit green tea ($4.50 for medium size) was like any other passion fruit green tea at another other bubble tea joint, but with no toppings. Given the price I would expect at least some aloe or tapioca.   The kimchi ($1.99) was not authentic kimchi. It had a strong MSG taste.   I had the signature rice noodle soup with braised bone-in pork ($9.99) with stuffed meatballs (+$2.99). I ordered the type with all the toppings added already so I only had to add the vermicelli. The bowl looks like the portion was huge, but in reality, there were two big pieces of pork bones that took up more than half the space.   I like vermicelli in general, so I thought the noodles were fine. The soup base was flavourful and not too salty. The soup base was supposed to be MSG-free but I was still very thirsty after the meal. No MSG but probably lots of chicken powder. The pork bone had almost no meat at all on it. The stuffed meatballs fish balls with a small meatball inside. It's the same type as the frozen type in supermarkets. $2.99 for 3 fish balls from the supermarket, seriously!? There were also some ham, crab meat, red sausage, a quail egg, and veggies included.   I wouldn't mind coming back on a cold snowy day, but probably not during any other weather. I was super sweaty eating the noodles today at -1 degrees, I can't imagine what it would be like on a hot summers day."}
{"text":"Toronto winter nights need steamy hot broth! We were craving some comfort food and nearby at the Eaton Center.   We put our name on the list and waited for about 15 minutes for a table for two.  I ordered the original Crossing the River broth with extra lamb.  The 10 toppings + lamb was super filling. We also had the salted fried chicken which was super crispy and delicious.  Definitely a place I will revisit for popcorn chicken and noodles deluxe! :D"}
{"text":"Busy on Sunday night but seated quickly and service was prompt. If you have smaller groups, you may ask to split tables with another group for faster service. This type of Chinese style soup noodles meant to be eat and go, rather than dining in and relaxing.  The Crossing the Bridge noodles is known for piping hot soup in a stone bowl, then you cook the toppings and noodles on the spot. You can also order soup bowl noodles, where the ingredients come cooked in the broth already.  Unlimited refills for rice noodles.  Ordered sour pickled cabbage fish soup noodles and big bone soup noodles. The fish slices were delicious - can taste the marinating wine which masks the typical bland fish taste from frozen basa filets. The soup was delicious - hot, just the right amount of sourness, and a good amount of spice from crushed peppercorns. All noodles come with some standard toppings like quail egg, black fungus strips, ham, cabbage and red sausage. The braised big beef bone literally had a huge beef rib in the stock. The meat was tender, but we felt it wasn't really worth the price for the amount of meat you get - the fish filets were much tastier.  Servers will keep calling \"be careful\" when they serve the piping hot soup. I feel that's a nice touch for the customers."}
{"text":"The first time I visited Dagu was at the downtown location where I tried the Crossing the Bridge noodles - I wasn't too impressed but decided to give Dagu another try anyway.  We went on a Friday night at 6:30pm, the restaurant was about half full at that time, but shortly became packed by 7:30pm.    I ordered the spicy and sour soup base with fish filet.  Overall mediocre taste.  Price-wise it is reasonable, only because you get unlimited noodle refill, so better go on an empty stomach if you want to get the most bang for your buck.  The server came to ask my friend a few times if she was done with her food even though she was clearly still eating and there was still a lot of food on the tray - maybe they ran out of trays for other customers?  Who knows.   I think it's a decent restaurant if you're craving for a boiling bowl of noodle soup on a cold day like I did today, unfortunately it probably won't make it as a regular spot for me!"}
{"text":"Do not go here... bland, over priced noodles. Tastes like a Chinese herb store in your mouth. Servers can not understand English... cool concept but terrible food."}
{"text":"Don't know why people line up for this. The service is worst. They have many empty tables but do not take people in. They don't tell people how to put stuff in and ask people to caution hot which other restaurants will tell people each time. They don't bring you the bill and ask people go front desk to pay. Food is nothing special. Not worth the wait at all. Bad experience"}
{"text":"The food is consistent with what you'll find at the other Dagu locations in the GTA (overall 4/5). Good toppings, unlimited noodles, delicious soup, etc. It seems like this location always has a lineup so the staff don't care as much about each customer. When we finally got a seat we had to wait a while for the menus to come and then even longer for the staff to acknowledge us enough to take in our order. When the food arrived (relatively quickly), we weren't given any utensils. When we asked for water, that didn't come for a while too. Overall the food is decent but the service is lacking in comparison to the other locations."}
{"text":"[Location] 4/5 - I called this the cursed corner of restaurants that flip every year. It is sometimes difficult to get parking at lunch but there is always many available spots in the underground lot. This place is located beside the popular ramen place...  [Service] 3/5 - Staff seems a little lost at times and forgot about which items we had ordered on the menu. A little clumsy for me.   [Decor] 3/5 - Everything seems clean and very spacious. I just don't understand what is the significance of that guy on the wall!! Is he suppose to make my food taste better??   [Food] 2/5 - In the last year (2017), there has already been a huge expansion of Yunnan based noodle soups. Sadly, this restaurant isn't adding anything new to the expansion. There is already another noodle place just a few stores down in the same plaza. The flavours were okay and the unlimited refills is a plus. The soup base was boiling hot it came. The appetizers were a complete disappointment with misleading labels.   [Overall] 2/5 - I won't visit again. There are many other restaurants doing something similar and cheaper with better quality ingredients.  I look forward to seeing another restaurant soon (within 1 year)."}
{"text":"Dagu must be a chain (I've seen two locations locally) and serves noodles with little bowls of ingredients to throw into your soup.  This restaurant is quite busy due to being understaffed and the wait time can get long.  Firstly, their soup base is good. I've tried the tomato and spicy ones and both were decently flavoured but not salty. The novelty of throwing in your own ingredients wear off and you do get a bit tired (there are over 10 dishes of ingredients!) and frustrated because the table is too small for all these dishes, especially in a larger group. I think next time I'll order the pre-made noodles and save myself the trouble.  Noodle portions are quite large and refillable."}
{"text":"This is my first time trying Rice noodle and it was amazing! Went there with two of my friends at around 4 so there wasn't a line. The place was really clean and waiters were really friendly to us. I ordered the Spicy Cross Bridge Rice Noodle and it was really hot but delicious. p.s. it goes pretty well with soy milk : D"}
{"text":"Selection is just the same as other Dagu rice noodle places. The staff were attentive to our needs. Noodles tasted good but they gave me very little tomato soup which didn't satisfy my cravings for hot soup on a very cold evening."}
{"text":"The first time I noticed Dagu was downtown Toronto where there was a huge line! And then when I saw that one opened near my house, I was super excited to try it out. Unfortunately I was not impressed. I don't think this place lives up to its hype.  Noodle soup is definitely one of my top comfort foods, but with all the competition in the area, there are so many places I would rather eat at than here. Maybe I'd go to the downtown one if I'm in the area, but I won't be a returning customer in the Markham location.  I wish the waiter would have explained the menu or concept to me. They just dropped off the tray of toppings and soup and then walked away. The noodles were a good texture, but for some reason there was something a little off with the soup base. The toppings were also pretty good... but I didn't really enjoy the meal overall. Maybe a different soup base would be better but I'd rather go back to my other usual restaurants."}
{"text":"I went to the Dundas location before which was super packed and uncomfortably warm. This location was a lot more chill and good for staying longer with friends. I ordered the sour and spicy beef noodles. The beef and sides to add in (fake crab, red sausage, corn, ground beef etc) came within minutes. The boiling hot broth and noodles arrived shortly after. It was quite delicious and satisfying, although I wished the broth was more spicy as advertised with two hot peppers. There are also free noodles refills in small bowls which is very helpful for hungry campers like myself! There were enough employees and service was quick and efficient. All this for $12 after tips and tax."}
{"text":"I think this place is good for downtown nearby Eaton Centre standards. Theres not much Chinese food nearby besides fast food and its bigger / newer renovated in this area. However, food and price wise theres definitely better in Scarborough. It comes with a soup base (I chose spicy), a few slices of beef, and many tiny plates of other condiments you can add into the noodles like one fish tofu and corn bits. Noodles is unlimited. Its $11. Nothing too special but I get the hype in this location."}
{"text":"Staff yell at to each other and you have to ask(verbally, they just don't make eye contact) for water otherwise they just don't bother.   Not worth it."}
{"text":"Location/Service - Within Commerce Gate plaza, corner lot where Game of Cheese used to be - Lots of parking available and underground as well, do note this plaza is constantly busy (so consider carpool where possible) - Inside is relatively big, can fit around 40 people  - Decor has been slightly rearranged where the entrance is shifted to the left inside of straight-forward; so there's a comfortable waiting area; other than that pretty regular decorations - Staff are nice, quick with order and constantly yelling \"WATCH OUT\" since the pot and soups are EXTREMELY hot  Food - You can choose their set menu item or build your own - Did a build your own, where it's their Signature Soup Base with Lamb Meat - What's interesting about this is that you can mix the ingredients when you feel it, and adjust to a level of taste that you want; sometimes you can obviously just put everything into one pot and eat it on the go - The soup base was very strong and tasty - Noodles itself were okay, but the small side dishes compliment quite well - Price was around $12-14, but quantity wise was very sufficient   Overall nice experience and a quick to-go place to eat. Comforting if you're sick or on a rainy day. But a little too over-hyped in my opinion (with videos and BlogTO) as it's similar to other dipping noodle places in the area."}
{"text":"First time visiting here cuz people always line up. I heard it's really famous in local, but it's as pretty bad as I expected. Order the ramen and server will bring little topping on the side and all the topping was cold, dry, bad quality. Service was bad and not organized."}
{"text":"The only thing I didn't like about this place is the extremely long wait, which, one the other side, shows how popular and busy it usually is. Food is awesome. Their signature starters are all worth trying and honestly every single one of them exceeded my expectation. Remember this should be a come and go fast food place so don't mind too much on the quality of service. I'd definitely go, when it's not peak time. P.s., They should definitely work on a solution to keep liners out of cold."}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????????????????? ?????????????????????????????????????unlimited refill?????????refill???????/?? - ???????????????????MSG?????????  ??????????????cash or debit????credit??? ???????tips?%?????????????tips amount."}
{"text":"Their broth and noodles are really good. However, there is always long wait for this restaurant. Often, 20 to 30 mins wait and always seem to have peak hours all day long."}
{"text":"The place is decent for a variety of soup noodles. I've been here 3 times now and we've had enough people to try and sample most of the menu mains. My favourite is the mountain cliff mushroom crossing the bridge rice noodle soup, with the pickled cabbage and rice noodle soup with fish slices coming in second. The signature braised bone in pork one comes with a good amount of pork bones, and is super filling. Note you can get as many noodle bowls as you want, for those looking to really fill up.  My toddler loves coming here too - it's clean, the high chair and boosters are never dirty, and the crossing the bridge has food items that she likes to eat on their own (fish tofu in star form? Win!).   If you're down for some serious spice, you should try the spicy flavoured crossing the bridge noodle soup. It was too hot for me though, and I regretted it after my first sip!   Service has gotten better, the first time we came it was definitely lacking - staff was overwhelmed. It seems they've since gotten into a good rhythm so they're faster and more attentive.   Cash and debit only!"}
{"text":"The food was better than expected. We ordered the Original Crossing the Bridge Rice Noodle, the Mountain Cliff Mushrooms Crossing the Bridge Rice Noodles Soup, and the Tossed Diced Cucumber with Garlic Sauce. The dining experience is much more better than the location at Dundas. The noodles are in very great portion and it comes with different commodities (vegetables, fish-cakes, meat paste and etc.). The serving of the diced cucumber were  tripled the portion size at the Dundas location (it was the same price !!!). The bill came out to be $30 dollars with tips.   Definitely recommend their Original Crossing the Bridge Rice Noodle"}
{"text":"After seeing that this place is always packed since it opened, I decided to come to see what the fuss is all about.  I ordered the Beef Rib rice noodles with lamb meat. When the order came, it was missing the lamb. The customer beside me thinks that they switched our order.  I told them it was missing the lamb, but they seemed confused at first as they're not very good with English. I had to point at the menu to show them what I meant and then dig through my bowl to show them. When my correct order came, the server had to confirm again. Why is it so difficult? Also I was not served any water.  All the servers came to me speaking Mandarin and assuming that I would understand because I'm Chinese (I speak Cantonese), on three separate times, even though I told them each time that I didn't speak mandarin.  The noodle, the broth, and the meat were very good, but it seemed a little expensive. It was 13.99 for the Beef Rib noodle and 2.99 for the lamb. After tax and tip came to close to $21. I'm not sure it was worth it. It was basically 2.99 for 4 thin slices of hot pot lamb.  I might come back and try the pork bone noodle (9.99).  In conclusion, good food but a tad expensive for the amount you get.  Quality: 8.5/10. Service: 5/10. Value: 5/10. Overall: 6/10 (not an average)."}
{"text":"The broth was really good! The noodles weren't as good as expected based on the hype, but they were ok. I ordered a dish that came with beef and I'm pretty sure I got lamb, but it was still good. Would go again!"}
{"text":"Visited the second week of opening, the restaurant was super busy and I waited for an hour for a table. Food quality and service was disappointing. We ordered the signature rice noodle soup with braised bone-in pork and tossed diced cucumber with garlic sauce. It took another 45 min for the food to come. The noodle was decent but the soup and commodities were below average. The diced cucumber were supposed to be an appetizer but it came last after we finished our noodle and we have to remind the server a few times that we still have an appetizer that haven't came yet. In my opinion, they should of hired more people to cope with the busy flow. There were only a few servers and it's difficult to track them down to order food and get help. The overall cleanliness of the restaurant was bad. Seats has oil stains and the table is not properly cleaned.  Pricing is moderate but compared to the service and food we got, I believe it is over-priced."}
{"text":"Interesting and definitely different experience from your standard rice noodle and soup cuisine. For sure, have to praise the richness and flavour in the soup bases; both beef bone and pork bone were extremely flavourful and were good broths on their own. The noodles themselves were nice and soft once immersed in the warm soup and come as AYCE (I was able to consume three bowls oops). Plus, the waiters were very nice and quick to refill noodles upon request. Just to note, the \"over the bridge\" selections are the ones where you cook each item yourself vs having it all prepared and ready in your soup. Overall, the cheapest AYCE you'll be able to find in the area. But if you're in search of a change to your standard noodle in soup, definitely check Dagu out for its excellent take on rice noodles in soup!"}
{"text":"Despite hearing many people talk about the long lines, I didn't actually have to wait in line. I came maybe 30mins after they opened and not many people were there yet. That being said, it seemed I got in right before the lunch time rush (thank goodness).   Poor server was running around to evey table , so I didn't blame her for not being overly friendly. I felt that she was quite efficient albeit a little aggressive when putting the dishes down on the table. That didn't really bother me at all though.  Their menu consists of rice noodle soups. Being a noodle lover, that was the perfect thing for me. I got the spicy and sour crossing the bridge noodle soup. Tbh I was hesitant at first--it's always a hit or miss when it comes to sour soups but it tasted great! More on the sour side but not over the top.  I think it would've been better if it was a littler spicier but I was overall satisfied with the taste. The dish comes with several toppings, and unless you want extra meat or something, it's fine as it is. You put the toppings in yourself, they come separate from the soup since they don't want to overcook it. The noodles were just the right texture for me (soft but very slightly chewy). AND YOU GET UNLIMITED NOODLE REFILLS. If you're like me, who doesn't drink much soup, adding extra noods in is a great bonus.   Price-wise I do think it's fair. They give you a variety of toppings that stores normally don't give and the soup stays hot the whole time. Also very worth the money if you get additional noodle refills. Yummy and filling!  Overall, I recommend this to noodle lovers or just on a cold winter day!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time as I LOVE NOODLES! I tried the cross bridge soup base as per other yelpers recommendations.   Love the soup, love all the add ins that come with it. I ordered additional beef but didnt like how it came inside my clay pot so I felt like it was overcooked by the time I cooked my other ingredients. I was taking my time taking photos for my yelp reviews when the waitress told me to hurry up and put the ingredient in my soup or else it wouldnt cook in time which I thought was funny.   I was convinced I would take up the offer the unlimited noodle refills but I didnt. I was too full even on my first meal. I love the experience, the amount of food (great value) and service was okay.  We tried the fried durian dessert thing but I wasnt a fan of it. I found the flavour of the durian too rich since it got cooked rather than fresh durian."}
{"text":"Not bad for a hot soup noodles on a cold winter day. There was a long wait time though and not much space to wait but the server was really friendly and made sure we were ok while waiting. Definitely very full after. Soup was tasty, not overly salty or heavy, ingredients were abundant."}
{"text":"It probably helped that I came in on a super cold day haha.....didn't have to wait on a Saturday around 2:00 pm. This location replaces Game of Cheese and parking around is usually not a problem. Judging by pictures at other Dagu locations I was wondering why no one else sitting down had the big trays of noodle toppings at their table - silly me because they take it after you put them in your soup (and take those nice pictures).  Ordered the original \"crossing the bridge\" noodle while mom ordered the pickled cabbage rice noodle soup. Both soups were definitely soothing and flavorful. Seemed like a lot of the toppings were similar between the two soups, except for placing the beef to cook in the soup for mine. Contrary to other reviews I had enough soup for a noodle refill so that made it worth for me.   Mix of small tables, booths and group seating inside with quick service. At around $10-12 starting for most noodles (more as you add toppings), I'm okay with that since its super close and convenient for me.  sidenote: if you listen to Jay Chou you may want to visit because that was the only artist I heard during my time there!"}
{"text":"This place was a bit understaffed for the lunch rush. Our table wasn't offered water, but wasn't a big deal since we all had soup noodles, so we didn't bother asking the busy waiters. The food was delicious, but they were too stingy on the soup portion. The first bowl that came out was 3/4 full but every bowl after that was less than half... Unlimited refills on the noodles, but I was full after one... Not that there was enough soup for a second portion anyways lol."}
{"text":"Gosh dang these bowls are nuclear hot!!  I can't imagine it'll be very long until someone seriously hurts themselves on these things.  I barely brushed by on it reaching for condiments and got a slight burn.  As for the broth itself, it was ok?  Meh?  I'd come back if I happened to be in the area with a craving and there was no line-up, but with the options available in a one block radius from here, there are a lot of solid choices.  I picked the \"signature\", but I must admit I prefer Korean style Pork Bone Soup which is at least 50% more flavourful.   Noodles were aight.  This is a good a representation of 3 stars for me as it gets.  Nothing wrong with this place at all, perfectly fine if you're in the mood, but nothing I'll really remember except for them freaking fire bowls."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. The soup is delicious and the unlimited noodles are a big plus. I got a noodle refill and was surprised to see a dead bug in the noodles. It wasn't a little fruit fly either it was a big disgusting beetle. I would not go there again due to the bug. If the hygiene and service was better I would come there again because the food is amazing! The drinks we ordered was also good, I ate there a few months ago so I hope the the hygiene and service got better."}
{"text":"Long lines every time, but well worth the wait. The soup was super savory with no sign of MSG. Would recommend avoiding rush hours otherwise the wait is kind of crazy. You can also get more rice noodles for free! Not too many other noodle places offer rice noodle bowls, which is a very special type of Chinese cuisine. Would definitely recommend going! We also got the cold potato noodles as an appetizer - greatly enjoyed the sweet, sour and spicy taste of the sauce."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch on a Thursday and like many other say, there is a line out the door! Luckily, because i came with a party of 3 we were seated right away as they have booths that are alot more easier to come by when you have a 3+ group.  Just like many, i wanted to try Dagu simply because it was sooo cold outside and that a bowl of piping hot noodle soup sounded very appealing. I've heard many things about this chain that opened up in markham and thought i would try out the concept of \"crossing the bridge\" noodle soup. (seems like we're getting alot of these in toronto lately). I ordered the original crossing the bridge and it came in a large bowl of piping hot pork bone soup (no pork bone though). The crossing included about 10 small little sides to put in your soup (such as fish tofu, can ham, corn, napa veggie, quail egg and etc). I also added lamb slices for an additional 2.99 (i think it was that price). The noodles are thicker rice noodles and are hot when served to you. The noodles are also unlimited! So if you want 2 3 or 4 bowls of noodle you can! They do have non crossing noodle soup bowls and those ones are almost the same price as the crossing the bridge ones. The only difference is that everything that you would have as your little sides is already placed inside your boiling soup. The bonus to the non crossing bowls is that you also get pork bone in it and that looked very appetizing!  We also tried the spicy pepper fried chicken (similar to popcorn chicken) and the spiced ox tongue. Both were really good and costed 6.99 a dish. They also serve fun fruity drinks at this location but did not get a chance to try them this time..  Would definitely be back to try a spicier version soup next time!"}
{"text":"The service is by far the worst. We ordeeed seafood and it came with pork. The menu doesn't specify that even meals such as seafood come with pork. Then when we said we didn't pork, they just picked up our plates and said we could order the tomato souo and left. They didn't try to accomodate to us and were basically telling us to just leave the restaurant. Thats what we did. ive never seen a service like this, except in another asian restaurant in Toronto. Horrible service."}
{"text":"After discovering Yunan/Crossing Bridge Noodle Soup this year, I have been on a Chinese noodle exploration for the last 6 months.  I was thus highly anticipating the downtown opening of Dagu, a popular chain in China.  My boyfriend had visited the Markham branch and he had nothing but positive things to say about the food.  When we visited this downtown branch, my boyfriend concluded that it's almost as good as the branch up north.  The only real difference would be the quality of the sides, which are saltier and smaller in portion size at the downtown location compared to what you would find at the Markham one.  Fortunately, the flavour, content, and portion-size of the noodle soups are pretty much identical, so you're not losing much unless you really want to have sides on the periphery.   We've been to Fudao, another popular vendor of Yunan/Crossing Bridge Noodle Soup.  Fudao pales in comparison to Dagu.  Fudao's noodles are so soft that they could feel soggy and their broths are bland, whereas Dagu's broths are rich in flavour and filled with chewy, firm noodles. The one trump card Fudao holds, however, is their price point.  Eating at Fudao will save you 2-3 dollars more, but remember it's at the cost of food quality.  Pros: - Servers are fluent in English and Mandarin - Broths are rich in flavour - Wait times are minimal  - Unlimited noodles  - Noodles are firm and plentiful - Booths are spacious and you can easily fit 6 people in them - Clean - Noodle soups stay hot for an extremely long time  - Walking distance from Eaton Centre  Cons: - Very little protein in the broths - Sides are saltier and small in portion size - Drinks are well over-priced - Stone bowls are 150 degrees celcius in temperature, so be mindful for children and company that is animated/clumsy - More expensive than other Crossing Bridge/Yunan Noodle Soup vendors"}
{"text":"i'm not sure what happened but they changed the consistency of the noodles and some of the broth flavors, the noodles are much softer now. the service is nice but they forget about you if you ask for extra noodles, so we always have to ask twice. They also don't let you substitute any of the side dishes unlike Fudao noodle house. We went a few days after opening and I feel like they wanted to keep a line outside on purpose to generate hype. We stood outside for 40 minutes and there were a lot of empty tables that the servers just left empty for 10 minutes before seating people.  I like the bamboo shoots side dish, but I'm not a big fan of the overall taste or price point. It's not bad but I feel like you can get much better price (less than $10) and better quality at Fudao noodle house which is not too far from here."}
{"text":"Terrible service, they are nice but cannot understand english well, which led to confusion in ordering and orders made wrong."}
{"text":"I went there recently. Before I finished my meal. The waitress asked me am I full. Then she took away my food then give me a bill. I didn't ask for bill yet. Went to complain with manager, he said here in canada the waitress meant to took away the dirty dishes then serve me tea. I'm just laughed. Are you kidding me?  By the way the the employees seems not very sensitive about hygiene. The disposable gloves are meant to be sued once. Not keep reusing it! I will never go back!"}
{"text":"Average food Pathetic portion even with add-on meat Service? what is service. Not worth wait. One time visit is enough for this place."}
{"text":"I ordered the new beef item on the menu and find the beef too smokey tasting for my liking. Basically it's cold and you have to add it into the soup to make it warm again.   I preferred my husband's original broth and the extra pork balls that he ordered. It's stuffed porkballs. Oh do not order the chicken drums, small, and sauce doesn't taste good. I wish I reviewed the order before I miss that he placed an order on the chicken drums. Anyways, the broth is hands down better than a lot of crossing bridge noodle joints. Will try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Nothing special. The noodles are just on average or a bit below. We were sitting there 15 mintues and the waitress didnt even give us a cup of tea/water. Will not come back again."}
{"text":"Overrated imo. The noodles were nice and chewy but altogether it just didn't feel hearty enough. I'd much rather prefer a bowl of ramen noods or a bowl at deer garden than here. The broth, while healthy, needed a lot of seasoning (felt like I was slurping noodles out of hot water lol). Yes, original crossing the bridge noodle is the one you wanna get if you like blogging or instagramming, but everything was underwhelming outside of presentation. Not to mention, I did not feel like I got my money's worth from such small topping portions. Don't think I would return on my own tbh. It IS unlimited noodle refill though, which is a plus if you're hungry I guess. Also, the chili oil at the tables is homemade which was nice."}
{"text":"Unlimited noodles! Large portions of soup. Has the option for something similar to hot pot, where you put your own food.   Tip: most of the food isn't as seasoned, must add some of the spices at the table."}
{"text":"I've been here around 3 times to get my fix of hot noodles in soup, on those days that have been chilly out.   The wait time around peak hours is around 10-15 minutes if there's a line. It generally empties out by a lot during off hours, in which, service is much better and it's easier to get through the line to pay.  So I've tried the following items: Signature rice noodle soup with braised bone-in pork - it comes with most of the toppings you receive with the 'crossing the bridge' style items in the soup. The meat comes off the bone very easily, however, it does not have a lot to begin with. The soup is flavourful, without being overly salty.   Pickled cabbage rice noodle soup with fish slices - this one does not come with any other toppings, other than a few fish slices, pickled cabbage and whatever add-on protein you may include. It's definitely quite plain compared to the braised pork one. The broth has the extra saltiness from the pickled cabbage, combined with a kick of possibly pepper or chili. .  Spicy crossing the bridge style noodles - You get a bunch of toppings that you put in yourself. You're supposed to put the frozen meat first, followed by the other proteins and then the veggies last. The spicy broth is tasty, and it has that numbing effect to it.   Pumpkin red bean pancakes: it's on the oily side, but they are also quite good without being overly sweet.   They have a good selection of drinks as well, if you want to get something with your meal. If you do not want a beverage off the menu, you need to ask for water. They do not bring you water as soon as you're seated, which is unconventional compared to other restaurants.  As for the service- I don't expect much since they just opened, so all things considered the service is okay with a lot of room for improvement. I hope that it does get better with time, since it has only been a week or so since they opened. During peak hours, it takes awhile to get through the line to pay compared to most restaurants. They take cash, debit, but not credit.   Overall, I would recommend the restaurant! Especially if you don't want to make the trip to Chinatown for a similar meal."}
{"text":"With the mediocre Yelp reviews and huge line-ups, I was so ready to be disappointed by this place. Let's just say I came out ready to go back.  Together, we ordered the Tomato flavoured noodle soup with extra beef slices, pickled cabbage noodle soup with fish slices and extra lamb, slice beef and ox tongue in szechuan chill sause, brown sugar sticky rice, and cheese green tea drink (we went all out). We loved everything we ordered! The soups definitely hits the spot as they came steaming and they soak up all the flavours from the ingredients. Notable mentions would be the beef and ox tongue and brown sugar stick rice, which we gobbled down. They seemed to be popular sides that other tables ordered as well. The cheese green tea drink was pretty good, and I imagine it would be a good complement to any spicy soup bases.  I will share some cons - the noodles were not as chewy as I would like, the amount of beef/meat slices that come with the noodle soup is probably not enough if you enjoy meat, and obviously, the line ups can be long.  I will say worth it on this spot!"}
{"text":"This place has pretty tasty soup base and they offer unlimited noodle refills. But the noodles themselves are pretty mediocre."}
{"text":"This place is busy even after dinner time (9pm) on a weekday!   They promise fresh soup and that's what they give you.   I think the bottom half of the noodle menu is where you get the soup, and place the meats and toppings in yourself; and that the top half is a more complicated soup bases (most which you have to add-on meat, if you want meat in it).   The three soup bases that we tried were very good. The signature braised bone in soup was very rich, the fish one was no surprise either, and the kimchi soup was not too spicy and flavourful!"}
{"text":"I had a mushroom rice noodle soup with extra beef. The soup is really rich and flavourful. After the server brought out the heated soup bowl and ingredients (meat, fish balls, noodles, corns, ham, etc), you will have to pour everything into your hot soup immediately! To let it \"cook\". There was a green paste, if you could see my photo, it tastes a little bit sour and will add some acidity to your soup base. The spoon is very helpful since the noodle is a little bit harder to catch by chopsticks. And there would be a small bowl (originally contains your plain rice noodle) you could use to let it cool down faster.   Overall it's a really good rice noodle! There is always a long waiting line. My friend and I were lucky. We only had to wait for 10 mins. Come either early or late, maybe will help you avoid the \"traffic\"."}
{"text":"Even with the line out the door, we luckily didn't have to wait too long with 4 people and managed to land a booth table. I got the spicy vegetables with fish and a side of lamb. Overall, it was okay.   As a note, the small platters where you can toss stuff in are only for the crossing the bridge soups (bottom half of the menu). I don't really understand the hype since I thought the food was only above mediocre imo. I mean, it's not bad, but just not my taste."}
{"text":"I've had the hot and sour soup with was DELICIOUS but not enough meat or noodles. Also had the beef bone soup, the bone was more delicious than the soup, but maybe this soup was just really outshined by the hot and sour soup.."}
{"text":"The food is alright. The soup is better than most of the other rice noodle places I have tried. Portion is OK considering the price. It's that worth an hour wait for the food along? Maybe.  Then the service. The service is non-existience. We waited a while before we are seated. It sounds OK, but the reality is we were really early and there are tons vacant tables in the restaurant. The servant is just wondering around not doing anything. Then we got seated. We have to ask for the menu after we seated there for 5 mins. We have to ask for a cup of water. We have to ask the servant to pick up our order. After another 10 mins, we got the noodle ONLY. The should have served the noodle, soup, side dishes at the same time as what all others do, but they decided to not follow the convention. Then, after another 5 or 10mins, my girlfriend got her soup. My soup did not come until I waited another 5 mins seating there stare at my noodles!  After all, they have good food, but no service"}
{"text":"The food is decent at best; there isn't anything overly special about it. I had the \"special\" pork noodle soup listed as a recommendation. Comparably, it felt as if I were having something I made on my own.   Aside from that, there is unlimited refill of the noodles so once you do finish the first bowl they give you, you can continuously request for more."}
{"text":"Another Dagu Rice Noodle franchise recently opened up next to Kinton ramen. This is the place formerly occupied by Game of Cheese, which replaced Grand Noodle only 8 months prior. Hopefully this new restaurant will break the curse of that corner spot and have more success than it's predecessors.  We ordered the Traditional Marinated Chicken Leg ($1.99 each) and Tossed Diced Cucumber with Garlic Sauce ($4.99) for appetizer. For the main, we got the Signature Rice Noodle Soup with Braised Bone-in Pork ($10.99) with lamb slices add-on ($2.99 extra) and the Mountain Cliff Mushrooms Crossing the Bridge Rice Noodle Soup ($10.99).  The marinated chicken leg was overcooked and quite dry. Had a decent marinade, but not too impressed with the chicken meat itself. Wouldn't order again. The cucumber with garlic sauce wasn't indicated as spicy on the menu, but came with a chilli sauce. Quite refreshing, but they should indicate that it is spicy on the menu.  Both noodle soups came in a very thick stone pot that kept the soup nice and warm until the end of the meal. The broth was very tasty and they indicate on the menu that it has no MSG, which is great. However, after having consumed most of the soup, I was quite thirsty afterwards. The add-on lamb for $3 really isn't worth the price for a few tiny slices of meat. Would skip next time and try a different appetizer instead.   Overall, I think this place is great, especially on a cold winter day. The food is cheap and they give you plenty of soup and the rice noodles are all-you-can-eat, so you can really fill up. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I ordered the 'Original Crossing the Bridge Rice Noodle' with a fresh watermelon juice.  The dish is presented with all the sides separately. This selection includes, noodles, wood ear mushroom, ground beef (I think...I hope), imitation crab meat, corn, tofu, bamboo, a quail's egg, sliced sausage, ham, lettuce and three rolls of beef.   Once the ingredients are mixed, the result is delicious soup with a good selection of protein and vegetables. This dish packs a wonderful variety of meats and vegetables; however, the dish does not contain MSG so it tastes a bit flat (less flavourful).  The drink was disappointing. Not in taste or presentation but simply in the endeavor of the individual preparing the drink. I was sitting at the bar and I was watching as it was being prepared. The server was preparing three watermelon juices and as she poured the contents of the blender into the cups, one cup was only half full. Instead of blending another watermelon, the server just filled the cup with water.  This location probably deserves a four star but I have to give it a three.  Stay for the food and stay away from the drinks!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Another rice noodle place.  This one offers unlimited refills of rice noodle so you will be sure not to leave hungry.   Been here a few times and service was prompt/polite and it's quite busy all the time.   The soup base is very HOT and like the sign on the table says, the bowl is HOT too.   Depending on what you order, it can be very spicy hot in conjunction with temperature hot-great combination for cold winter days!   Another recommended place to eat in Richmond Hill!"}
{"text":"So when this place opened up in the commerce plaza, I seriously muttered an \"uh oh\" .. because ai xiang a few doors down will definitely suffer some damage as they serve pretty much the same thing (except without unlimited noodle refills) and they are one of my favourite authentic spots. These noodle places are all the rage and popping up errwhere these days..  The service is fast but everybody was confused.. for example, when our group ordered, they only brought over 1 or 2 noodles and didn't know to bring more until we asked (there were 6 of us. We all ordered noodles- how did this happen?) Also they seemed genuinely confused when asked anything. Strange, really. The food came out very fast though, and other than that- the orders were right.  I got that big beef bone broth one, so I didn't have to mix in my own ingredients and oh man, this was some good broth. Very savoury without overly salty. It is a perfect treat on a freezing day, I can say that for sure. It also comes with a bone with some beef on it, which was really soft and yummy as well. 5/5 on the dish.  The prices are above average, as many other lowkey places serve the same thing for a few bucks cheaper. For my special bone broth one, I think with tip, it was close to $18-19, which is not a cheap asian meal for one.  There is SO much hype around dagu but well deserved? Ehhh."}
{"text":"I didn't expect much from Dagu but you're better off going to any other chinese restaurant if you're looking for noodles and soup.  I've had the opportunity to try the sour and spicy beef soup and the tomato beef soup and while the soup is quite excellent, you're not getting much in the way of toppings. I suppose this is why there's options for toppings, but the initial amount of topings and sides are extremely limited in quantity. You end up eating mainly noodles and soup. There's spoonfuls amount of corn, singular amounts of a small egg, a fish cake, etc., there's three thin slices of hotpot beef. There isn't much veggies. There's unlimited noodles refills but the noodles aren't all that special."}
{"text":"Dagu really hits the spot when you're looking for a bowl of flavourful piping hot rice noodles but is not in the mood for pho. My go to orders here are the pickled vegetable fish bowl (sour soup base) and the mushroom bowl (earthy mushroom flavour). I doubt that the entire flavouring of the broth comes from fish/mushroom in either cases but as Dagu is a quick and fuseless meal option in my eyes, I wont complain.   They also have bomb fried popcorn chicken and unlimited noodle refills if you are feeling hungry!"}
{"text":"Would give it a 0 if possible.  Came in to try it out.  The moment we arrived, no one greeted us or indicated where we could've sat.  We sat ourselves down at the communal table.  I had to call the waiter for the menu.  I had to call the waiter to take our order slip.  I had to tell the waiter he gave us the wrong food.  I had to ask the waiter for water.  Notice a running theme?  Food was average.  It was just average and bland.  At the end, we asked for the bill.  Waiter told us to sit down and that they'd be back with the debit machine.  The waiter walked passed us twice with someone else's bill but no machine.  My boyfriend went back to pay again and noticed 2 unused debit machines easily within reach.  He considered punching in the amount into the machine himself.  Oh wait, he did do it himself.  He paid the full bill and tips.   I saw my friend in the line and whispered to her to not waste her time.  With better service this place has the potential to do very well."}
{"text":"Dropped by this place for a hot bowl of noodle soup. Reading the reviews we were looking forward to our meal.   We both had the pork bone noodle soup with the addition of beef. It came out in a large cast iron pot and was extremely HOT. For an Asian restaurant I found the broth tasty without being overly salty.  In the broth were two large pork bones, each with a good amount of meat, as well as small quail egg. Noodles had the right amount of texture and came in a separate bowl. There is free refills on noodles which was good as one bowl wasn't quite enough.   Service helpful, establishment clean. All in all a comforting meal at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Great alternative to pho. Amazing flavours w fresh noodles. Chili on the side for added spice. Perfect for cold nights to warm the belly before bed."}
{"text":"3.5/5 Lots of these rice noodle places popping up thought  I'd give this one a try this place looks pretty  clean and well-kept I went for the beef bone because it had a limited quantity mark on the menu the bone was very huge and had a lot of meat on it and the broth was pretty good I have to say the soup is really the star of the show at the noodle the  companion good to have all you can eat noodles but  are kind of soft but I guess that's pretty typical and wifi wasn't working don't know if that's typical"}
{"text":"Went here today and we got 2 'signature' bowls, the original pork bone and the pickled cabbage with fish. Both were around $11-12.   From what we ordered, it's basically the same soups. It was just that the pickled cabbage one's soup was more sour and spicy. They were both really salty and tbh, tasted kind of like msg. However, when it came, it was super hot so on a cold day this would be really good.   And the things that were in the bowls were basically the same except that the pork bone one had a few pieces of pork bone and the other had fish.   The fish in the soup was pretty good, nothing too special. Just the typical white fish from the freezer probably? The meat on the pork bones, however, was super tough. I only ate a little piece out of the 3 bones they gave. But the flavour that i got from the piece was pretty good. Too bad i couldn't eat the rest ¯\_(?)_/¯   Overall, not quite worth money. The things that they gave in the bowls were mostly straight from the freezer, like corn, imitation crab, thin slices of sausage, etc. If the soup tasted like it's been specially cooked for hours and were really flavourful, it might be worth it- but it wasn't. It was just salty and msg-like. The noodles were fine. If you want to try it, go for it because it wasn't bad , but nothing about the dishes would really make you want to come back."}
{"text":"I don't understand the three stars! The noodle was amazing. The pork bone you get is huge with lots of meat. The fruit tea was really good too!!!"}
{"text":"You are absolutely selling yourself short if you come here but don't try the pork bone or beef bone broth that's been slow-stewed for like 10+ hours.   The \"Crossing the Bridge\" part of the menu where the noodles, soup, and the toppings come separately is a fun eating experience, but honestly nothing spectacular - it might be fun to have it once for novelty's sake.   The stewed broths though, are perfectly flavoured and so, so, so aromatic, and filling without being heavy."}
{"text":"I find it strange - that the early Yelp reviews were so negative about Dagu and yet during dinnertime the line up to get in is over 25 person deep.   Trusting my eyes, I gave it a try.  Food: Specializing in rice noodles, there is a choice of different soups along with additional items (like beef slices, lamb, shrimp, etc). I ordered the Tomato flavoured crossing the bridge noodles with extra slices of beef. All your ingredients are provided separately.  You then place it in a bowl of boiling tomato flavoured soup. The beauty of this place is that you control how cooked and the intensity of your soup flavouring.  Tip: Don't just throw everything in at the same time. That is a rookie mistake!  Raw meat first (or later if you like it more Red), then cold meats, then sauce, then noodles, then preserved veggies. Lastly you put in any fresh veggies. This provides the proper texture - your soup noodle will turn out excellent!  Mine was tangy and the noodles were al dente.  Decor: Fairly clean and comfortable. Place is still brand new.  Service:  I was not expecting Ritz Carlton. Still I was pleasantly surprised that my servers were polite.  I asked for a water when I ordered and got it right away.  Overall: the line up is justified. This is a good place for some unique tasting noodle soup in downtown Toronto. Another solid 4+.  Tip#2: get there before 5pm. The line grows exponentially thereafter."}
{"text":"First time trying out Chinese ramen, thought it was pretty good tbh! I got C1 and added extra beef, and was pretty full."}
{"text":"I came to this place way too often. Not just wanted to try with different soup base, it was also fun to have different drinks aside to cool off myself.   As I commented last time, the serving pace is really impacting on the dining experience. There is a customer sitting beside my table. He was waiting at the table for 5 mins or more, with no menu to start with. Till he called one of the servers over, otherwise within that time range, no one even addressed him.   Today, the restaurant wasn't busy, 1/3 of the tables are vacant. We ordered the cheese watermelon drink with the noodles. After we had half of the food, the drink wasn't even ready yet. We then asked to rush the order. One of the staff put the drink on the bar table to be delivered. However, a few servers passed by the bar but I guess no one saw it.   Again, I like the food there, however, the unnecessary waiting is not making the experience in any positive way. Hope the management team will address this issue with the staff members for improvement."}
{"text":"I went there yesterday. The soup is good, the downtown location was too salty for me but this one is way better. Food was served quick and service were OK."}
{"text":"Tasty broth.. quick service.. watermelon juice! Large portions.. I'm definitely coming back"}
{"text":"We'd just finished shopping at the Eaton Centre and decided to try this place out. I'd remember seeing a post about it on BlogTO.  It was about 8:30pm on a weekday, no line up but all the tables were full. We were a group of 3 and waited about 15mins to be seated.  The menu was self-serve (you check off with a pen what you want to order). The prices ranged from $10-$12. My friend suggested the Tomato one and I loved it! It was a nice light tomato soup that came with beef slices.  The broth was served in a stone pot (super piping hot!!) and the unlimited rice noodles delivered separately. Each order comes with a platter of side dishes: sausage, tofu, artificial crab meat, mushrooms, corn, paste and other things.  Overall, this was a delightful experience and very filling meal for Winter. My other friend wasn't a fan of their dish, so I recommend trying the Tomato soup one!"}
{"text":"Nice decor with minimalist service. The noodles and soup are sub par.  We sat down and was given one menu to check off our orders with. That is their system. 1 menu for the table even if its a table of 6. Its odd when you experience it yourself, how do they know whay extras are for which meal?  I ordered B3, a tomato based noodle soup which came out spicy af! I couldnt even taste anything other than fire. The noodles were soggy too which maybe the style they were going for but im not a fan.   When i got my bill it had the correct B3 but the description was the spicy noodle soup which is B2. So their system is broken at the moment.   I tried the original pork soup and mushroom soup base which were okay. The mushroom soup was pungent but too salty. The original was soothing and comforting.  The concensus from our table was \"just okay.\""}
{"text":"A busy restaurant frequented by many students. Their rice noodle dishes are priced very well, and are served in a piping hot bowl! The sides come separately, which is a fun way to eat.   I did not quite understand why the sides (noodles, meat, etc) came before the soup, and not together. Some of the options are quite spicy as well, so choose accordingly!"}
{"text":"We love Dagu!  The decor is simple and comfortable. The staff is friendly and speedy too!  What we love most is the price and what you get. We tried pretty much every single soup and they are all flavorful and packed with toppings. It's such a warm and fuzzy feeling to have a nice bowl of dagu noodles on a winter day. The drinks are pretty standard but the snacks like the Salty Crispy Chicken and Chicken Leg are worth trying out!"}
{"text":"I frequent here a lot and the customer service has gone downhill. Today, came as a group of 3 and they had 2 free tables left that are two-seaters but sat the group of 2 in one that came after us, they should have pushed the tables together so we can sit first, another two-seater was already opening up, why make us wait longer when you could have accommodated all of us. In addition, we ordered right away but people that came after us by at least 15 minutes got their food before us, another girl who got her food first was also confused as to why she got her soup before we did. We waited more than 30 minutes just for the ingredients to come out, and then another 10 for the soup. Someone that came after us even got our exact same appetizers before us too. Honestly, if you forgot to put our order in then be honest with us and compensate, all they did was \"let me check for you\" and then we had to wait some more."}
{"text":"We were there on a Saturday for lunch around 1pm. We arrived for a good 5 mins before we realized that you were supposed to write your name and party number on the clipboard hanging next to the door (no sign or instructions from the staff). There were empty tables that needed cleaning, but none of the staff were in a real rush to get it cleared for the long line at the door. Another 15 mins later, we were finally seated. We were given menus to order from, but it took another 5 mins before we were given cutlery and cups. Water was requested multiple times before someone finally brought it to us. The soup and noodles were good for the value, but it was not worth the wait. And for an additional $2.99, it was not worth the extra three small thin slices of lamb."}
{"text":"Even though Toronto can't seem to decide what season it is, we know winter is coming, and what's better than noodles in a bowl of hot soup on a cold day? We went to this place during its soft opening around 12:30 and only had to wait around 10 minutes for a table of 4.   The interior is spacious and well lit, and has a number of large tables and booths for larger parties and small tables for parties of 2. There's a good number of wait staff, but you might have to remind them to bring you water. They were quick to bring a menu, though, and happy to explain the most popular dishes when we asked.  As an appetizer to share, we got the Beef Jerky Soaked in Szechuan Chili Sauce, which was pretty tasty with a hint of spice that got our appetites going. For our mains, we got the Signature Rice Noodle Soup with Braised Bone-in Pork (the one with Braised Bone-in Beef was also recommended to us), the Pickled Cabbage Rice Noodle Soup with Fish Slices (I got this one!), and Tomato Flavored Crossing the Bridge Rice Noodles Soup with Beef Slices, which came with a tray of multiple ingredients that you can add to the soup, which was pretty unique. They bring you the bowl of soup and noodles separately, in case you're wondering, because we were pretty confused at first about why people had trays with nothing else. All the noodles in soup were flavourful and rich with generous sized portions, and the one I got had a good amount of fish slices and fish cake, which was great! The noodles had a nice texture to them, too, and were easy to ladle into your mouth with a spoonful of soup.  Overall, this is a great place to come if you want something a little bit different from all the ramen in and around Dundas street, with lots of different options to try. Worth checking out, and maybe even coming back for more!"}
{"text":"As the great Homer Simpson once said: \"Hello taste?? Where are you?!\"  Okay, I was definitely drawn in by the promise of unlimited noodle refills. And I'd heard that this place is legendary in China. But what I had was....flavorless and boring. I hate to say it as I had high hopes and was expecting big things, but there was nothing to it. The noodles were okay, but they are the rounded rice noodles that when put into a soup just make it a sloppy mess, and that's essentially what this was, so I stopped at two bowls of them. Got the pork bone soup. Pork was tough and the soup was very plain, just nothing to it taste w  Got a side of the crispy fried chicken bits, which were good. They taste like popcorn chicken but with a cinnamon twist to the flavor. This is good.  The service was slow, but the waitresses were friendly. Prices were not outlandish, but with the lackluster overall quality, I'll pass on coming back  UPDATE:  Second time's a charm, it seems! After my first review I was invited back to give the restaurant another try. It seems that the customer service rep, Dora, had read my review and she reached out to me to ask if I would give them a second chance. I did, and I'm happy I decided to do so! When a business cares enough to invite you back to try out their other menu items, that shows that they genuinely care about their customers and their experience there and I consider that above and beyond.  So I arrive at the restaurant and ask for Dora and she quickly pops out of a booth to greet me along with the restaurant manager who goes by M (I think that's right) It also seems very James Bond, although I assure those reading, there's nothing cloak and dagger about this meal experience!   We sit down to talk and briefly go over my first experience. Flavor seems to be the obvious topic as I found the first time to be lacking. They bring out the red carpet: Two bowls of soup (Sour and Spicy flavored soup with Xiang Xe pulled smoked beef and Original Crossing the Bridge). The sweet and sour broth is not my favorite but is flavorful, robust and tasty. Spicy but not overpowering and as soon as you've had the broth the sour element disappears almost immediately. The smoked beef is tender and flaky and it's aromatic qualities are readily apparent and blend well with the rest of the ingredients. I discover there is a technique to properly eating this soup, to which Dora and M are happy to help me with. They sit intently as I eat my meal. The Original  Crossing the Bridge soup has multiple layers of flavor as well and I find it to be my preference. It's subtle but salty, has the right amount of oil which helps retain the temperature of the soup as it layers the top of the soup itself, and the pork is tender and the other ingredients such as sausage and fungus add to a broth that is not singular in its depth or dimensions.   They also bring out appetizers: Salty Crispy Chicken and Crispy Pork Filet. I enjoyed the chicken immensely before, so they indulge me again, to which I am grateful. Both are quite tasty.   Then come the drinks. The bring me three: Super Fruit Tea, Cheese Strawberry drink and Strawberry Yakult (yogurt). All three are amazing, but the last one is my favorite of all of them. The cheese drink is amazingly not cheesy which is a good thing, meaning no flavor overpowers the others, it's a balanced palate.   Last but not least, the desserts: Brown Sugar Sticky Rice (resembles a large French fry) and Deep Fried Pumpkin Pancake with Red Bean paste. I'm not a huge dessert guy, but both are good. If I had to pick, I'd definitely go with the Brown Sugar Sticky Rice cakes. A really nice balance. The Pumpkin Pancakes remind me of sugar coated donuts but without the sugar. More demure but still good.  So that was my second visit with the good people at Dagu. Beyond caring that I'd had an initially not so great experience, they were just super nice people and showed me another side to their food.   It does pack plenty of flavor, it is worth going for and most importantly, I will be back! Thanks Dagu, for a great day!"}
{"text":"I went to Dagu Rice Noodle last night (Thursday). There was a waiting line for around 10min, which is acceptable. I ordered \"Signature Rice Noodle Soup with Braised Bone-in Pork\", with stuffed meatballs as add-on. It looked nice! However, something went wrong when I tasted the stuffed meatballs and I have had diarrhea for two days. I hope that it is just an accident but I probably wouldn't come back again."}
{"text":"Food was good and I liked how you can do your own hot pot style.  Careful on the bowls as they are popping hot.  The hot and sour one I had was a little disappointing,  as it was just too sour.  I was expecting a nice balance of flavors,  but you can tell it was an instant paste they used to achieve that flavor to their pork bone soup base. The salt and pepper chicken was the highlight. Over all decent soup,  but I'll stick to ramen or pho."}
{"text":"VENUE/AMBIANCE (5) Well-lit, modern restaurant with small tables and bar seating great for pairs and small groups. No dedicated parking - street parking and paid lots nearby. Clean and tidy when we arrived on a weeknight at 6:15 pm.   SERVICE (4) Waiting for a table is somewhat a negative experience. It's been a cold winter and their lines often extend outside. However, the staff refuse to take group size or give out numbers to guests waiting in line outside of the restaurant. Only the few people who manage to squeeze into the small enclosure are given numbers. It's pretty inconvenient for larger groups. The waitress who served our table was great though - polite and friendly when she took our order and when she served our meal.   FOOD (4) I ordered the Original Crossing the Bridge Rice Noodle (9.49). This includes 10 toppings, 3 slices of beef, unlimited noodles, and a boiling stone bowl of soup. Soup base was delicious - deep and flavorful but not salty. The bowl kept the soup hot,  through my first and even second bowl of noodle. There's enough toppings to accompany two bowls of noodles, but those with bigger appetites (or males) might want to order additional meat/protein. Noodles were chewy and well textured; they didn't get soggy while I ate.   QUALITY/VALUE (4) For 9.49, this was reasonable for the location and amount of food served. Extra protein is 2.99, which makes the meal significantly more expensive. Other soup bases also cost a little more. For the original flavor, it's worth it. I'm not sure how much more I would pay to try other flavors.   OVERALL  4 stars"}
{"text":"I tried the bone-in braised beef here and it met my expectations. The braised beef was fall off the bone tender, and they gave a decent portion of it. I was pleasantly surprised when I discovered a quail egg, near the end of my meal. The soup was textbook and flavourful. The best part of the experience was the unlimited noodles. Pro tip - if you have multiple bowls of noodles, don't put them all at once in the soup if you like your noodles a bit el dente, put the noodles in the soup as you are ready to eat them"}
{"text":"A dainty, nicely-decorated noodle place. I had a fresh shrimp soup (can't remember what it's called) and it was okay. The soup is bland, but there are condiments on the table that you can add for more flavour. Of course, I had to peel the shrimp which was expected but still annoying. The noodles were also pretty plain, not sure if they expect the noodles to absorb flavours from the soup...? I wish they would've seasoned the noodles a little or something beforehand for a little more taste. The lighting in this restaurant is cool; look up, and you'll see an arrangement of pipe lighting that's very cute. Also want to note that their washrooms are very clean (at least when I visited, they were lol). It wasn't bad, but I don't think I'd visit a second time."}
{"text":"We went in again for another try today. Restaurant was not as busy as last time, and our appetizer arrived after about 5-6 minutes. We ordered the spicy cucumber, which had sweet, sour and spicy taste, and it was good. We ordered the original rice noodle with pork bone and the spicy flavored rice noodle. Nothing extraordinary but not disappointing either. The soup came before the 10 small dishes, the order was a bit surprising to me.  Service was good, we could feel that owner and waiters were doing their best to provide better service."}
{"text":"We recently visited during lunch. It was our first time and we found the experience good. Food came out pretty quickly and everything tasted pretty good. It is a bit of a hotpot experience with some meals. We tried the Tomato Flavour with beef slices. Was not a big fan of this soup base. Also tried their Signature Noodle Soup with Braised Bone In Pork. We liked this soup base more because it had good flavour. It seems all options come with noodles and generally the same ingredients and you just pick your preferred soup base and meat. Unfortunately we were not a big fan of their style of noodle so not sure if we will be back."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, the broth is really good!! Comes with 2 pieces of braised pork bone, unlimited noodles but I was so full from the pork bone! Ordered the \"Signature Noodle Soup with Braised-in Pork\"- $9.99. I actually prefer the combo over the crossing the bridge noodles since it comes with pork bone.   If you get the \"Original Crossing the Bridge Noodles\", the ingredients comes on a side tray which you can add in yourself. Highly recommended Dagu Noodles!"}
{"text":"I have always wondered about the line, finally came by at 4 to try. No line! Yummy soup, definitely a go-to place on a winter day."}
{"text":"It was one of those nights where my friend was craving warm noodles on an ungodly cold night - bomb cyclone anyone? Little did I know that it was an ambitious endeavour just to get a chance to let these noodles tantalize our tastebuds. But determined and stubborn, we braved the cold and stood in line outside the restaurant for 30 minutes. My face pressed against the restaurant window watching and mildly cursing under my breath at how slow these diners were at eating as they happily slurped steamy hot noodles.   Sweet relief finally came as we were finally seated and near a window too. My eyes sparkled in delight but with slight confusion as I browsed through the menu. I ordered my tomato soup base and meat side which was mistake number #1. Side dishes already comes with meat so paying extra for more meat was unnecessary. Curse them for taking a few extra dollars away from me!  It was a short wait for our food. But in the brief 5 minutes of waiting, I had a chance to look out the window to see all the wannabes outside still waiting for their turn. I empathized and pitied them. When the food came, another wave of confusion came. What do I do with all these dishes? The waiter did not provide instructions and I didn't want to look like a noob amongst a sea of seasoned diners. I ended up tossing everything into one big bowl and started eating which I believe is still the right thing to do.  The waiter cleaned up just as fast as she delivered the food. But the lady worked at such super sonic speed that she splashed tomato soup base on my shirt. She ran to get napkins but the damage was done. Though I appreciate that the service was quick, quality of service was sloppy at best.   Overall, the food tasted great. But was it worth the long, cold wait? No. And to those noodle lovers out there who want to give this a try, wear black, just in case."}
{"text":"Came here during the week for lunch. One server working who was extremely busy running around to make drinks and take orders and bring food to the table. We ordered the pork bone and the original bridge noodles. The pork bone was very tasty and creamy. The meat was very tender - however if you're in a rush, maybe get something else because it took some time to remove the meat from the bone because it was boiling hot for a very long time. The cross bridge was not as flavourful as the pork bone but it was still good - it came with quite a few toppings on the side that you need to put in the boiling broth yourself. We also added beef slices (4 hot pot tyke slices for $3) and it was not worth it. Both broth seem a little greasy though. We also ordered the salty crispy chicken, which was the same as many other places. The whole lemon green tea was tasty but we could barely taste the tea itself, it didn't taste like the Chinese style lemon tea - it tasted more lemonade (like CNE lemonade). The cheese green tea was very tasty, it has this creamy foam with strong flavoured green tea. Food came out fairly quickly and everything was very clean looking. We will definitely come back again to try the other kind of broths."}
{"text":"Ordered the Kimchi Noodles, was not disappointed. The broth was really savory and not too spicy.  The service was okay. I don't think they ask if you want something to drink unprompted, though that might just be my memory failing me. They also don't refill unprompted, though that kind of goes hand in hand with the previous thing.  4/5, would recommend."}
{"text":"Wait time ok. But this location isn't the greatest as it has had several places turn over here. Hopefully this place provides just the right mix of popularity and revenue to anchor this place on a more long term basis.   If you hit this place at the right time, the wait is not too long.   Service is perfunctory, but fast and efficient - but I think the aim is to have a quick table turn over.  Kimchi Noodle set comes with the expected accompaniments and isn't too bad.  But a little too spicy for my taste. But overall ok.   Rice noodles refills are unlimited.   Right now they are only accepting cash or debit only"}
{"text":"Leaving this review to reflect the way they treat waiting customers by leaving an empty table of 4 for more than half an hour so a crowd of 30+ people can awkwardly wait on the other side of the glass window in the cold."}
{"text":"Vegetarian here. Only vegetarian item is their tomato base noodle soup. As expected, lacked in flavour. Vegetarians don't waste your belly here! My girlfriend enjoyed her beef noodle soup though"}
{"text":"Passed by on weekday afternoon, felt a little hungry, so popped in. Just ordered Spicy Fish broth rice noodle. $11.99 the rice noodle was dropped off at the corner of the table long before the soup came out. The rice noodle was hot, but didn't know what to do with it. Finally here came the fish soup. Fish didn't taste fresh, just feel the salt. The soup is in quite good volume though. The waitress greeted me was smiling at least , added one star there. Overall, if you feel like a big bowl of hot soup with rice noodle, give it a try."}
{"text":"We have been meaning to try out this new place for a while but each time we drove by there was a lineup outside so we would go to our usual favourite in the area, Sansotei.   Today we got there early. Roughly 4:45. Still had to wait about ten minutes but inside. The guy at the door was very nice and gave us a menu to look at while we waited.   The place is nice and bright and has a funky vibe. I did feel like I was in Melbourne's Asian restaurant heaven for a bit. The music is loud but not intrusive. And the whole place is buzzing with wait staff delivering hot bowls of goodness.   We sat down and Cindy explained how the menu works. The top four soups are already filled with all of the ingredients and made when they come to you. The rest below you put in the ingredients yourself. We opted for the ready made ones and I had the pork bone while my wife had the fish one that they recommend.    Both were really good. Although a huge warning. And they warn you as well.   THE BOWL IS CRAZY HOT!!!!!!!!!!  Both of us had at least one touch of scalding on our hands so please be careful.   We also had a tofu appetizer which was great.   The noodles were good. Not my favourite but good. And the soups were very rich and not overly salty. And each had a quail egg, some ham like squares, cabbage, woodear mushrooms and corn pieces.   I think I preferred my wife's choice. It actually reminded me of soups my aunt makes in Poland. A little sour but so rich and delicious and with a little heat.  So great on a cold day!    We really liked our food and will likely come back. Maybe we'll see you there?"}
{"text":"I can see why this place has only \"okay\" reviews. I ordered the rice noodle soup with braised bone beef + shrimp for $2.99 more. My bill ended up being just shy of $20. The broth was decently good and basic, beef was deliciously tender, and there were only 3 unpeeled shrimp. Personally, this meal is worth $10 max. I know it's unlimited noodles but I felt satisfied with just one.   My friend ordered the soup with mushroom. The menu called it crossing the bridge. It seems like the additional ingredients (tofu, bamboo etc) is on the side and you have to put it in the soup yourself (Whereas my soup already had it).   There's a line outside during peak hours. Not worth the wait!"}
{"text":"When we got here, there was a short line outside the restaurant.  Small rant: The system to seat people is quite inefficient. They only jot down your name and party size for groups that are in the indoor waiting area (fits about 6ppl). Anyone after that, they are not interested in your group size and you are to wait outside until there is few enough people before you so you fit that tiny space. So essentially if there is a party of 6 before you and lots of unconnected 2 people tables, you ain't getting seated as a party of 2.  Nonetheless, we went early at 6, so the wait was only 15mins. Having been to similar noodle chains uptown, I was happy to see more soup base options at Dagu. They are priced ~$2 more than I'm used to, but could be just a dt price.  Similar Yunan style noodle setup: You pick soup, comes with 10 raw misc. toppings you cook in the boiling soup. Noodle itself is bottomless. Food came within 5mins of ordering. I had the mushroom soup and I was very impressed. Mushrooms were fragrant, there was good quantity and variety (enoki, button mushrooms, oyster mushrooms etc). Toppings were basic hot pot offerings but the soup really elevated the whole experience. I also like how the soup did not taste sour from pickled veggies, which is something I often dislike in Yunan style noodles. Overall, service was prompt, beautiful noodle dish, I would love to come back for more."}
{"text":"We passed by today on a rainy Sunday, so naturally this noodle house was busy. Perfect time for noodles. My bf and I went in, and the atmosphere was chaotic. We quickly got seated at the bar (we came in starving).   Everything after this went downhill. We were handed a menu and pen. Ok, no greeting, fine. I'm thinking, okkk they want my order quick so they can get this food out.   We quickly jotted our order on the menu and looked around to see who would take the menu. The lady making drinks looked at us and said \"you ready?\" and we nodded our heads as she confirmed our written orders on the menu.  Two other customers sat on the left of us and went through the same steps as us. (10 minutes passed) and the customers on the left received their orders. And we were left waiting. This is how I knew something was wrong. Another 20 minutes passed. ok. I'm officially pissed. I finally said something to a waitress and asked who took our menu. She left and came back to let us know, our menu was lost, AND WE WOULD HAVE TO REDO OUR MENU. By the time we received our food, the two customers next to us had ordered, ate and PAID for their food.   This company has absolutely NO CUSTOMER SERVICE, very UNAPOLOGETIC for their own mistakes and on top of that their broth was very bland.   They should get ZERO STARS! They ONLY positive thing about that experience was the beef tongue app. But that was not enough to undo the whole experience.    AVOID THIS PLACE. There are tons of ramen/noodle joints on this street that can surpass this place."}
{"text":"FREE UNLIMITED NOODLES!!   Yes, the wait was long. We went early hoping to beat the rush, but we still had to wait 30mins at 5:30pm. Wait staff estimated 30-40mins when they took down our names, so we actually waited the minimal expected wait time.  I don't know why everyone says it's bad service. Everyone had smiles on and was very accommodating in answering questions, explaining menu items and dish preparation, was quick to come over when service was needed, except one guy who was still friendly but only spoke mandarin to everyone lol (I think language barrier..)   After being seated everything was pretty prompt to taking our orders, bringing our drink, first bringing out our cold meal toppings and then about 10 more mins for the soups to come. The soup was steaming.. I was borderline lips burning but I couldn't stop slurping. Bottom soups on the menu all have the toppings on the side whereas top soups on the menu are all toppings in the soup already. I actually quite liked this as some items are more in pieces and can get lost in the soup so I would leave those out until I want to eat them (corn, minced pork). Or you can have half cooked meat if you put it in last! I tasted both soups before and after the addition of the toppings and honestly the toppings add in MUCH flavour. I'm actually not sure if the top menu items have the same toppings or not but I prefer it this way. GUARANTEED noodles that aren't bloated (my pet peeve). The staff are quick to take away the extra plates.  We ordered tomato crossing and spicy crossing. Although I wouldn't order the spicy one again (it was a numbing hot which I don't usually go for), the flavourings of all the toppings were great. Loved the tomato one too - it was SO tomatoey!!!   The cheese mango drink is interesting.. think gongcha with the whipped cream on the top.. but more cheesy... okay cross that with uncle tetsu cheesecake. No real fruit chunks. The cup was really functional, I liked how the red lid could be stored on the lid while sipping.   Will gladly wait 30-40mins another time to eat here again, and make our friends wait with us."}
{"text":"It was such a busy restaurant, packed with a long line up. I am truly not understand how they are so busy.  The food they provide were all junk food and some preserved vegetables fish ball crab meat. In term of nutrition I will say ZERO. I picked a tomato soup base doesn't taste like any tomato in it.Rice noodle with Fully Msg soup.Everyone can cook such instant noodle at home. Really wondering where the people coming from to line up, maybe just me like to enjoy the real food."}
{"text":"I went to Dagu for lunch, was told to get here before 12 or else there will be a pretty hectic line. I got here at around 11:50 and there was already a line. We waited for about 10 minutes with 3 parties before us. Everyone was squeezed in between the first door and the second door..felt pretty icky.   We were given the menu right after we were seated. I ordered the traditional rice noodle (first on the menu) and it came with two good chunks of pork bone. The soup was MSG city, salty and full of MSG, but it did taste surprising good. Not a restaurant that claims to be MSG free, plus this is a Chinese noodle house, wasn't expecting it to be super healthy and organic.   Extra noodles are free of charge. I had 2 full bowls of them, and it was pretty value for how much it cost. The noodles itself was great, super tasty and great texture.  Service here is speedy, you can expect yourself to be in and out within 25 minutes."}
{"text":"The hype for this place was too much for what it is. The food is pretty standard, but at a higher price than most other noodle places like this (fudao in Chinatown).  When we went on a Tuesday evening the line was out the door.  You can also get unlimited rice noodles."}
{"text":"Worst customer service. They rudely told me they don't allow two people to sit at a four people table. But the thing is they don't have enough small table. Indeed, this place is very small. So. I sit there watching three people group and four people group got seats. After waiting for almost twenty minutes, I give up. I will never go to this place again...worst experience"}
{"text":"Delicious! A lot of fresh fish and shrimp in the Suan Cai Yu Rice noodle, which can be added shrimp, beef, lamp etc. The bowl is hot but an excellent lunch in a rainy day."}
{"text":"The broth is excellent!  However, I never got a chance to look through the menu...I felt rushed my the server to put my order in asap.  The reason I am giving this restaurant the A-OK is the service is quite weak.  Yes, they are busy but they overlook the orders.  They missed punching in 1 order for me and I saw my drink order sit on the counter with a bunch of other orders for quite some time and I think the restaurant supervisor had to get the host to find the server bring them to the customers.  The line up to pay was lengthy and it took a 5-7 min wait standing in line to pay.  I think this process should speed up."}
{"text":"Honestly, I'm quite disappointed with Dagu Rice Noodle. This place received a lot of hype since it opened. There is always a crowd by the door and the wait is pretty long depending on when you go. The ramen is pretty standard, what you'd expect at a regular ramen restaurant, nothing special."}
{"text":"We had the original pork bone noodle today. It looked and tasted SO different than last time. The soup was absolutely watered down! You can even see the floating blood foam which is supposed to be washed off!!! Then what chef explained to us was, it's because they used lots of chicken soup in it too. Seriously??!! It's a pork bone soup and now you are revealing the truth huh. FUNNY. Also the meat on the pork bone is so hard to even bite. We absolutely believe it's leftover from yesterday. Definitely not coming back to something with inconsistent service and quality!!! Coz you don't want blood foam in your soup!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the many restaurants that offer unlimited chewy rice noodles in various soup bases.  I usually get the tomato soup base with extra lamb!   Unfortunately, I was not impressed with the service and quality of food at this specific location. When we first arrived, there were two waiters and perhaps 3/4 of the dining room was full. The waiter had told us to wait but we wouldn't expect to wait over 20 mins because there were some tables empty. As we continued to wait, at least 3 tables had left but no one went to clean up. I was a bit thrown off the fact that they decided not to clean up the tables to quickly serve us.  Fast forward to the food. The noodles were not chewy. You can tell it wasn't cooked well as the centre was a bit hard to chew. I thought that if I put the noodles in the soup, it'll soften the texture but i was wrong. Also, the soup wasn't as boiling hot as I hoped it would.   Told the waiter to get 2 extra bowls of noodles and he forgot... I had to ask another waiter to get it for us.  To conclude, service here is definitely slow and food quality is mediocre. There are better options!"}
{"text":"Got the signature noodle soup with pork bone for take out. Put the soup in a pot and brought to a boil. This is a key step to enjoying this noodle soup at home.   Soup was flavourful and filling. Will definitely try dining in next time. Wont hesitate to order take out again."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has 3 stars but I think it deserves 4. We dropped by on Saturday around 1pm and waited for approx. 20 minutes. They give you a number and you have to wait on location to be called. I've had friends wait over an hour so don't come here if you're in a rush.   SERVICE: The service was pretty quick (maybe they have hired more staff recently) when we asked for extra noodles (unlimited by the way) and took away our empty plates promptly.   FOOD:  We got both a spicy and a tomato crossing the bridge rice noodle soup. They were both very flavourful and we didn't find them dull as other reviewers suggested. So far, I like this place over some of the other restaurants that offer a similar noodle + toppings concept.   We also tried a strawberry yakult drink at $4.50 - while it was refreshing, half of it was basically foam so I wouldn't order it again.  AMBIANCE: The restaurant is clean and nicely designed. There are a couple booths for larger groups.  PRICE: Very affordable at ~$10 per meal"}
{"text":"Just amazing food. I love the noodle love the soup base. Not much msg wasn't thristy after drinking all the soup!"}
{"text":"In general, the food was very standard and not as impressive as many advocate. However, the atmosphere, presentation and price makes this a convenient stop to satisfy noodle cravings after walking around the Eaton Center.  Total: 19/25  Food Taste: 3/5 - Group of 4 ordered the Signature Rice Noodle Soup with Braised Bone-in Pork Tomato Flavored Crossing the Bridge Rice Noodles Soup with Beef  Tomato Flavored Crossing the Bridge Rice Noodles Soup (Vegetarian) Original Crossing the Bridge Rice Noodle and shared the Salty Crispy Chicken - We enjoyed the flavors thoroughly and experimented with each ingredient, adjusting tastes to preferences - The vegetarian option was very different flavors than the one with beef, making my vegetarian friend left out in the experience - The broths for meat based orders were not as strong or rich as anticipated, and lacked much meat to be eaten with the noodles - Tastes were rather average and not as \"hype\" as many advocate - The Salty Crispy Chicken is a must try! better than most places, strong flavors and rather limited breading with juicy pieces. - Texture of the noodles were bouncy and very smooth but tastes were also standard.  Food Presentation/Portion: 4/5 - Presentation was intriguing with many side plates to \"cross\" into the hot stone bowl of soup - A nice variety of colors make the meal appealing and appetizing - Portion for meat was rather slim, but the \"unlimited\" noodles were great   Customer Service: 4/5 - Friendly staff and rather not much complaints with everything - Fast delivery of food and helped refill our water quickly  Environment: 4/5 - Bright lighting and the decor was nice and comfortable to sit around - The only issue is the waiting area is small, and there are always people waiting for seats - Would suggest not going with a bigger party than 4 and for quick meals parties of 2 would be the fastest  Price: 4/5 - The price of the items were appropriate to the amount of food we received"}
{"text":"The noodle soups here are super delicious and the prices are reasonable.  Great for winter time. The only complaint is the long wait time but that only speaks to the popularity of the place :) would recommend!"}
{"text":"3.5 Stars!   I came here for brunch with my partner on a Sunday afternoon. The food is good, the service is fast, and the price point is fantastic!   Here's what we ordered:   Salty Crispy Chicken: 10/10  Fantastic, fresh fried chicken; truly mouth watering.  Signature rice noodle soup with braised pork: 8.5/10 This was a delicious and hearty dish on a cold winter afternoon. The broth was cooked perfectly, not too salty; the pork was tender, fell off the bone nicely, overall delicious.   Sour & Spicy Crossing the Bridge Rice Noodle w/ Beef: 7.5/10 This was extremely delicious, but overwhelmingly spicy. I also found this slightly too meaty. That said, my partner thought it was perfect so it's just a matter of taste.   Strawberry Yakult: 8/10 Delicious, but extremely sweet. We saved the majority for after the meal.   Overall, I was impressed with the quick service, delicious food, and fantastic price point (approximately $30 for all of this).   My rationale for the 3.5 star rating is that GB Hand Pulled is around the corner, and I would choose that 9/10 times."}
{"text":"Flavours were okay, developed enough but not mind blowing. Noodle portion was huge but the other protein/veggie portions were near non-existent.  Also seems insulting to be served half a piece of sliced ham on the side, along with half pieces of other assorted meats. Only 3 paper thin slices of beef were served too - barely enough.  Waiter tried to take away our plates with unfinished food without asking while we were still eating, didn't ask beforehand, was impolite, and said they didn't have enough plates. Also kept forgetting to bring our water after asking multiple times."}
{"text":"First, food is ok. However, they claim the restaurant opens at 11:00, however they actually let people wait until 11:30... Tens of people just stand outside waiting the place to open even 20 minutes pass the open time. Canada winter is COLD. BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE."}
{"text":"A more accurate rating of this place is actually about a 3.5. This is because the service was really off the day we came. It was a Sunday morning and the door was practically rammed out of the front. They were able to take my name down quickly, but the wait was about 10-15 mins or so. The amount of influx that this place has on weekends, was sufficiently more than the amount of seats they had in the restaurant (must have meant that the place was good!).  Food- I ordered the spicy original noodle. It was quite tasty! I would highly recommend getting this. It starts of a base around 9.99 (I believe?), then you can add more sides like beef, or pork or other things listed on the menu. Before the bowl of boiling soup comes to your table, there is a tray full of various ingredients. You can put these ingredients in the soup bowl, it's pretty good. The only thing you have to be careful of..is literally the pot. ITS BOILING HOT. But overall great food! Unlimited refills on noodles.  I would recommend this joint if you like soup.  P.s. good luck finding parking. It gets hectic in this lot, but make sure other people aren't banging into you! It becomes dangerous!!"}
{"text":"Fast service and excellent quality of food. Interesting menu for those who aren't used to writing down your orders. English food names are not self explanatory as well so I would recommend looking up choices on Instagram for visuals.   We came here on a Tues night with no lineup but it was packed. Suggest going early (630pm for dinner) to avoid the crowds.   Would have given this place 5 stars but the server forgot to bring out the bowl of noodles after we received our soup base + condiments. After waiting a few mins we had to ask for the noodles. Other than that, the service was attentive afterwards.   Overall, I'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Spicy Flavoured Crossing the Bridge Rice Noodle Soup for lunch.   I really loved how the noodle soup came with an additional tray of ingredients that you could throw into your pot to cook. I love the idea of just cooking it yourself. It's pretty unique to me.  The broth tastes a lot like the spicy soup base that you would find in hotpot however I really enjoyed the soup as a whole with the additional meats and veggies. As an added plus, they do offer UNLIMITED NOODLE REFILLS and I was satisfied by the 2nd bowl! Service was amazing and perfect."}
{"text":"Short summary: Extra dishes wasted on toppings they can just add in to the bowl before serving.   My friend and I were debating between this place and Lan Zhou Ramen but since this place was new and the line wasn't bad, we came here on a Monday late evening around 8:30. Friend tried to come here before but the line was way too long so we both had pretty high expectations to see what the hype was about.   Food: Friend ordered the signature rice noodle soup with braised bone-in pork while I got the original crossing the bridge rice noodle with beef slices.  The soup taste was slightly different between these two, but my friend's came with all the side toppings on a lot of little dishes before the food, while mine had all the same toppings but it was just put in the soup before it came out to our table....we're still not sure what the point of this is. Maybe all the extra dishes are supposed to wow people presentation wise? Not worth it.   You can get refills on the noodles but not on these toppings. I think I'd rather go to Deer Garden instead for soup noodles."}
{"text":"Didn't love the experience. I tend to get the recommended or most popular item on their menu my first time so I got the signature rice noodle soup with pork bone-in. I got served a bowl that was filled almost entirely by two huuuge bones. There was absolutely no meat on either of the bones i had to actually throw away 75% of my dish. Thats absurd. I enjoyed the broth but nothing special. There was 1 piece of tofu and maybe 2 pieces of bamboo shoots and I found 1 mushroom in this whole bowl.  I was here on my lunch break. I wanted to be in and out quickly but because they serve you bowls that are 150C, i basically spent my entire lunch break waiting for my bowl to cool. I didn't have to cook anything in my bowl, all the ingredients were already in there, so I found it kind of useless to serve me a broth that hot. I asked for my bowl to be doggy-bagged and the server didn't even help me at all even though she was standing right in front of me and saw me struggling because of how damn heavy their bowls are. And on the machine there is no option to not tip. I definitely wouldn't eat here again."}
{"text":"Wait time at 8.15pm: 25-30 minutes says the hostess.  Opted for take out which took 25 minutes ?.    Ordered the Signature Rice Noodle Soup with Braised Bone-In Pork and a side of Bean Noodles in Spicy Sauce.  Both were really delicious!   Since I ordered take out I was happy the soup and noodles were kept in separate containers (wished there was more soup though).  The soup/broth was very tasty and flavourful--but I would like to try it in the hot stone bowls next time.  The bean noodles in spicy sauce was also really tasty where the sauce was sort of a vinaigrette and noodle was served cold--it was really tasty!  Besides the long wait for food and the queue for a table not much to complain about.  I would definitely return  staff were also very friendly and nice.  Keep in mind prices has increased and the menus shown online are not accurate (add $1 to the rice noodle bowls)."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is horrible. The waitress was extremely rude. They want you go away for other customers to come in and not even wait till you finish your food and drinks."}
{"text":"One of my favourite go-to cheap eats in the city. I love the idea of unlimited noodles (but I really only get 2!). The original is great but the tomato flavoured version is tastier if you want a slight kick in flavour. The standard order gives you 2-4 rolls of meat so you don't really need to order extra protein unless you're really hungry. Note that this place is debit and cash only."}
{"text":"The desk is gross... noodle is just so so. I was expecting Sichuan pepper oil for the rice noodle, they don't even know what it is. Really don't know if they are Chinese restaurant or not. And you have no options to choose tip on POS machine."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars Visited ~7pm on Saturday right after Black Friday and stood in line for what seems like 30mins. It's definitely not worth the wait but overall was satisfied with our noodle soup and sides. The server was helpful w/ the menu, \"crossing bridge\" means the noodle and ingredients are separate from the soup and you add it all in yourself vs. the regular which has it all prepared inside. The waitress recommended tomato or the spicy sour crossing bridge noodle soup but she's from Szechuan so her taste profile may skew on the heavier spicier side. She also recommends adding shrimp which I say is not worth the effort since the shrimp isn't peeled! I actually enjoyed the simple broth from the braised pork bone instead since the delicate taste of braising the bones are more apparent, unlike the tomato version where the tomato overwhelms it.   Ordered - w/ ** marked for recommendations  - Signature Braised Bone in Pork Rice Noodle Soup  **Recommend over tomato version though very skimpy on the protein so you might want to add meat. The soup broth here really sets itself apart from other places. There's a reason why it's called signature!  - Tomato Flavoured Crossing Bridge Noodle Soup with Beef Slices + added shrimp - Tomato kind of cover the taste of the braised broth and only ~3 pieces of shrimp are provided and needs to peeled  - Deep fried Pumpkin w/ red bean paste - **Recommend chewy and absolutely delicious - Egg Tofu - Interesting texture reminds me of a mix of a mushroom and tofu with a vinegary sesame sauce - Deep fried Durian pastry - It's okay it doesn't seem like they added sugar as it's less sweet than I expected for dessert  - Salty crispy chicken - Good no complaints here"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. Had the original noodle and the broth was very tasty. The crossing the bridge is when they have the other ingredients including the vegetables and meat on the side and you put the stuff in the soup bowl. It's cool because you can get unlimited noodles and the soup bowl always stays hot due to the type of bowls they use. There is a bit of a line usually so try to come earlier if you can. Would return!"}
{"text":"Worst asian noodle I've ever had. Maybe they make good desert but I don't see why their main dish (rice noodle soup) was so bland. I ordered their beef and pork soup and I can confidently say that it was the most boring, bland tasteless dish I've ever had. The soup base was made from pork for both the pork and beef soup. For the beef soup, don't even bother with the meat because you will get more bone then beef. What little beef you do get is tough, rough, and tasteless. The pork doesn't get much better either. The good news is that you get more meat then the beef, but that's where the good news ends. Despite having more meat to eat, like the beef, the pork meat is also tough, rough and tasteless, especially the tasteless part. The blandness of the pork makes you not want to eat. Nothing in the soup makes up for the blandness of the pork and beef. Another point that I would like to say is that these were dishes recommended by the waiter. Please save yourself from the trip and do not eat here."}
{"text":"I'm a converted fan. The first time I tried their noodles, it was good but there wasn't a huge wow factor. I really didn't think I would come back but now, I find myself craving the warmth and comfort of their refreshing broth and noodles. It just really hits the spot for me without making me feel lethargic after a hot meal.  I always get the signature pork bone soup - it's rich enough in flavour for me without being overly salty. The bowl comes out steaming hot but it doesn't retain heat so it's best to put the noodles in ASAP to cook it for a bit longer.  I don't eat too much meat in my diet normally so the amount on the bone and other ingredients (ham, quail egg, bamboo shoots, red sausage, etc.) in the bowl was perfect for me. Though I can see how some people would not be satisfied with the amount of protein they provide. But honestly, how is that any different from other noodle places that give you two slices of beef for the same price? There's a reason why you can choose add-ons.   Their sides are also amazing - I'd recommend the crispy chicken (a.k.a. popcorn chicken) and sliced beef and ox tongue in Szechuan chili sauce!  If you're hesitant about the 3 star rating, keep in mind that for all Chinese restaurants on Yelp - that would be equivalent to 4 stars for the food if you ignore all the people bitching about the service. I haven't had a bad experience myself in the 4 times I've come here - quick to seat us, quick to take orders, quick to come out with food, and didn't take forever getting us the bill and change. They're a busy restaurant so yeah, it would take some effort to flag them down but I haven't seen any of the servers being rude to people. So if you're not sensitive to service at asian restaurants, definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"This place feels like a McDonald's for Crossing-the-bridge noodles. The food is okay (in fact the soup is pretty tasty), the drink is bad, and the service is a little messy.  The food is totally fine, except the ingredients feel a little cheap. On top of the soup and the noodle, you only get some pickles, some frozen fake meat (one piece of fish cake and two pieces of crab cake), three thin sliced SPAM, one quail egg, and three thin sliced frozen beef. The soup itself is pretty good, and they do say you can have unlimited refills for the noodles, so there is that. I get that the noodle soup is marked on the cheaper end, but I would love it if they could swap out some processed food with some greens.  The drinks we had are not that great. We had a strawberry cheese drink and a watermelon cheese drink. They are priced at about 6 dollars each, but what they taste is kinda like flavored ice sugar water with cheesy cream on top. Again, it is not TERRIBLE, but it just tastes very cheap. For the same price and the same location (rip Bear Burger), we used to have thick multi-ingredient milkshake right here, and it was absolutely delicious.  The service is not very impressive. It feels like the waiters didn't get enough training, there is no clear area/task assignment among them, and maybe they just need to hire more people. There were maybe six waiters working, but somehow we saw three tables open while a huge line of people waiting there not being greeted by anyone. I think they should assign one employee to be the host/hostess at least during the rush hour. The actual waiting time for the food was not bad at all. It just took time for a waiter to notice that we were ready. They don't seem to serve water until you request it. Maybe they think you should just drink the soup? The place is pretty new, so I will give them some benefits of doubt and hope they would improve in the near future."}
{"text":"I have been at many Funan noodle restaurants in the GTA, but Dagu is by far my favourite. When I come here the service is always fast. Food tastes amazing and the portions of meat and vegetables are fair. The best part is the AYCE noodles! Chewy noodles with just a hint of crunchiness to them. 5/5 stars."}
{"text":"Good popcorn chicken, watermelon juice, and soup.  Toppings don't really make sense for the soup/noodles but whatever.  Very little meat.   Crowded AF there is no breathing room. There should be like 30% less tables in here.  If someone burps in your general direction your meal is over."}
{"text":"I am a fan. We were intrigued when we passed by late Monday night on our way to Sansotei and decided to try something new instead. The interior is brightly lit and spacious but man was it packed! After waiting for about 20 minutes we were seated at the bar and given menus. Similar to Deer Garden you can customize your soup base along with your toppings. Unlike Deer Garden they only serve rice noodles. I ended up trying the braised bone in beef soup and got the marinated chicken leg as a side.   The soup noodles are served in a piping hot bowl so I would wait a bit before diving in. My bowl also contained a heart shaped egg tofu with some sliced ham and a quail egg. I didn't have any expectations so I was really surprised by how good it was! The broth was delicious and the rice noodles soaked it up so well. There was also great texture to the noodles -- both bouncy and tender (you can ask for unlimited noodle refills!)   Would definitely come back to try their other items. A great spot when it's freezing out and all you want is a bowl of soup."}
