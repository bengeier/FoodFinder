{"text":"FOOD: \"upperscale\" (?) Italian food. Decent sized menu with at least 5 choices in each section: appetizers, pastas, meat, seafood. I had the pasta w/ clam and loved it. But they over-cooked (and had to re-do) my guest's steak...   SERVICE: depends on who you get. The lady serving the table beside ours was extremely friendly and helpful. Wish I could say the same about our waiter...   COST: About $15-$20 for each entree. The meal for the two of us (with a 1/2L wine) ended up around $70.   OVERALL: Newly renovated (I can still smell the paint), a grand piano in the main room (live music potential?) and free parking in front after 6pm. Weighing the distance from my house vs. food quality and price... I'd probably choose to try many others before returning."}
{"text":"Wow. I am really not sure what the last guy was talking about.  My wife and I used to come here a few years ago, but we left the country. We moved back recently to the same neighbourhood and thought we would see if Albino was still running the place and how nice it is.  No disappointments at all.  We started with the bruschetta. It was as wonderful as ever. Toasted oval garlic rounds with bruschetta mix on the side. I always love it this way because I choose how much tomato goes on it.  No alcohol as my wife is preggers and I don't like to drink in front of her, so two Iced teas sufficed.  My lady had the Osso Buco, and I had the Linguini alla Marinella as I almost always do. I love this seafood rose sauce and the pasta was homemade as usual. Al dente. Very tasty. I took some veal from my wife (when she wasn't looking...she doesn't share well during pregnancy) and it was tender and juicy.  Two lattes and a fresh homemade Tiramisu to finsh.  Dinner was only $56 bucks before tax and tip.   The fun part, was that when we were leaving, The owner Albino came out and greeted us, asked about our first child and congratulated us on our second. After 6 years he still remembered us and we only used to come once every two months or so. What a guy.  We look forward to coming here again."}
{"text":"When the family wanted to take me out on my birthday, I finally had to choose a restaurant. I reached deep into the memory banks and choose this one. It had been one of my favourites in the early 1970's.  We called ahead to ensure that they had the Osso Buco, and on the appointed birthday sallied forth to the establishment.  I was not surprised to see that the interior had only changed a little, and the group was generally pleased by the decor. A central area with a grand piano flanked by 2 eating areas one on each side describe the layout.  We ordered appetizers, salads and the Osso Buco. Everything was prompt and the service was generally pleasant.  That is where it stops. This establishment purports to serve classical unadorned Italian Cuisine. It is unadorned, but not very good. They used in almost very cooked dish way too much oregano. In the Gorgonzola Raviolis, not enough cheese, and in the aforesaid Osso Buco way way way way too much dry oregano. It was not very good.  I guess some places are in the heart and in the mind, and should be left there. I have now purged this meal and place from the memory banks."}
{"text":"This place is funny. Went there with a voucher from buytopia and an open mind. Service was ok i ordered the steak, it was a striploin but i normally prefer more tender parts of the cow. It was cooked decently a little on the well done side although i asked for medium rare. The steak came with a side of pasta which tasted like penne plus marinara sauce even though the waiter said it was rose. Husbands chicken cream pasta was good. Tiramisu was also good but small portion.  the funniest part was multiple patrons came into use the coupon. This poor white boy came in with a date and asked if he could use his mobile coupon then he got reamed out by the owner for twenty minutes who said shes not doing it to give food away for free and wants people to come back...not sure exactly what was going on in that conversation  but eventually owner let him use the coupon. Then the family beside us was told they couldnt use theirs because they ordered from the specials menu. Nonetheless we were sweating worried about our situation. Desperate to not pay full price we fearfully asked if we could use ours. With our dilligence in ordering regular entrees we were granted our wish. Thank goodness!"}
