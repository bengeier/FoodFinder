{"text":"This used to be one of my favourite restaurants, but I am finding that they have gone quite downhill recently. They keep offering endless Groupons, so I have been here about 4 times within the past  year.  On my last visit, I made a reservation but it was missing when I arrived.  Luckily it was just for 2 people and they had free tables. I always get the French onion soup, I could tell that they changed the recipe. It was watery and bland. The lettuce in my caesar salad was wilted and I had a few rotten pieces. One of my friend's crab legs was empty. Also, I could tell that the size of the baked potato and the vegetable side portion were significantly smaller than previously.  I am not sure if it is under new ownership, but I am definitely disappointed. I used to speak highly about this restaurant to my family and friends, but not anymore. I don't envision myself returning, not even with a voucher."}
{"text":"Step back in time to the 70's and enjoy a nicely cooked steak with side table service.  Had a rib steak cooked medium rare with steak cut fries.  Steak was actually cooked perfectly unlike numerous other places so they obviously have a good feel for their broiler.  Very nice charred flavor on steak as well.  Great tasty old school fries but forgot to get their gravy which is supposed to be very good.  Other dining companions had prawns which were done beautifully and their sides of stuffed and baked potatoes were very tasty.  Boiled carrots were a little bland but that was the only real complaint."}
{"text":"It was ok, food took a long time to come out and there was an abundance of food. My two year old ordered something off the kids menu and it was large. They don't really know if he was 2 or 12. And when I got my meal it was plain and dry. Nothing special ..."}
{"text":"This treasure is a blast from the past, when the customer was king.  The service was excellent, and the food  was delish!  They served the baked potato with a trio of sour cream, bacon and chives.    I can hardly wait to return.!"}
{"text":"I was surprised in a good way. I tool my girlfriend there for a dinner and we were extremely pleased. The service is great, food was awesome and came in perfect time and the environment is beautiful. There's not much I can take away from this place and I'll recommend it to anyone who wants to have a good time in NE.  Oh and the drinks were awesome too."}
{"text":"Service excellent! Really friendly! Out side a little worrying and inside a little date but I loved it! Service with a smile! We both got a steak sandwich with chunky fries $5.95 each! It was soooooooo good! I didn't think it would be for the price but it really was good! Will be back again! Limited menu today but still good!"}
{"text":"Service was great, the garlic bread is amazing! The food was a tad on the overly salty side though. They need to really hold back on the salt. Otherwise, the food is very tastey."}
{"text":"This place is a throw back to the 80s. The decor is dated and dark but cozy. It is a fan favourite with an older crowd (read: your parents over 60).  The food, while plentiful, is decent but nothing to rave about. My salad for example had honestly 20+ croutons in it (they are homemade and huge). Others at the table had no croutons.  Some of the steaks at our table were cooked perfectly, others not so much. Consistency was a bit of an issue it appears.  The service was also hit and miss. Our main server was okay, sometimes good. But the younger staff clearing tables were clumsy and didn't care. Now we all have to learn as we go in life but no one was watching what they were doing. I had bacon bots dumped on my lap as well as water. No apology. I'm pretty easy going but it was kind of rude not to acknowledge they had messed up.  The best thing about this place is the amount of food you get for your dollar. Considering how pricey other steakhouses in the city are, this is a nice change from that pace. Sure the food isn't as wonderful either but it does the trick. It's a decent spot for a large family group that otherwise wouldn't fit in or be able to afford a fancier place. There is definitely a feeling of \"value\" here."}
{"text":"This place used to be a great place to go on a  Friday night. The servers are very friendly  and they remember what you drink. But the food is terrible. Go home after eating there and see what happens. I Have tried all the pub food . It used to be good but no longer. Beers are very limited. They don't keep any stock. I don't plan on going there anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, awesome atmosphere, I have no complaints about this place. They ran out of scallops so offered crab or lobster instead for no extra charge, and they actually brought both!  There really seems to be an emphasis on customer service and it shows.  Service was very friendly and excellent for our large group of 14 people and the pricing is very reasonable for the type of service and quality of food offered here."}
{"text":"excellent food despite dated decor, menu and service   the decor, menu, and service is straight out of 1980 - totally dated - but i actually kinda like that. Where else can you still get garlic toast LOL? the food is EXCELLENT, although I don't find the prices to be low as some others in this thread would say. i had the steak and lobster last night, which at $38 is about what I expect to pay anywhere else around town. the caesar salad and french onion soup are both superb, as is the seafood-stuffed mushroom appetizer. big thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I remember going to the Reef n' Beef back in the late 80's for my wedding. Sporting the decor of a classic steakhouse with its dimly lit dining room and wood accented everything, the place still looks the same today.   I've been here twice with some people from the office for a work lunch to have the $5.95 steak sandwich. For a $5.95 steak, I don't expect much in terms of bells and whistles, just a nice steak that's cooked to the way I order it. I was disappointed to be brought an overcooked steak...on both visits. There is nothing that bugs me more than overcooked steak.   For a quick lunch, Reef n' Beef is ok if you want to get away from the food court crowd. Don't go with a large group unless you want to risk getting the wrong steak. Other than that, its not bad food, but not memorable."}
{"text":"The pizza here is soooo good! I don't like going into the restaurant because there are definitely some... INTERESTING people hanging around inside... especially if you go later in the evening... it's one of those places you're scared to try out because it looks like a dive but it turns out to serve some pretty good food."}
{"text":"So it was dinner time for my friend Abby and I.  First choice was Olive Garden but there was a 40 min wait so we ended up leaving.   I mentioned Reef n Beef as another friend of mine recommended the place before but I never have been.  Abby has been there before and said yeah sure.   Everyone says in the review - don't judge the place based on location and outside of building - like the cover of a book.  This place is now one of my faves in the NE.  When you walk in the place looks like you entered a time warp. I don't know what year  70's or 80's  The books on the wall remind me of Harry Potter lol   Food time: All meals at Reef n Beef come with the following: Unlimited home made Garlic Bread -  my friend finds it funny that it comes foil wrapped lol Choice of Onion or Mushroom Soup - we both had mushroom and I believe it's home made  Choice of Caesar or Garden Salad - Abby had Ceasar and I had 1000 Island which is home made by the way   Abby's main entree was NY Steak medium & Baby Back ribs and I chose Prime Rib medium well and Dried Rub ribs ( 2 pieces) - all meals come with side of veggies and choice of potato.  We both chose Stuffed potatoes and they come around with all the trimings ( Bacon, Sour Cream, Green Onions etc) The yorksire pudding was wonderful and soft,  the gravy on prime rib was delicious- not over bearing and just enough flavour.  I really enjoyed this meal.   One thing to add:  The water glasses are HUGE which I love as I am a water drinker!!!!     5 Stars!!!! and I'm having my birthday dinner here :)"}
{"text":"We were given an Anniversary Card for this restaurant worth $20.00.   So we used it this week. And I came away with some questions. First of all, how is a classic Caesar Salad prepared?   It doesn't appear they are prepared a la Chef (at the table) any more but some places actually still have the waiter apply parmesan cheese and pepper at the table.  We received neither on our salads. To it's credit he Reef and Beef serves the closest taste version to a classic Caesar but the waiter didn't know the ingredients ... he called it house dressing and could not tell us how it was prepared.  I'm thinking he was really busy that night because other wait-staff in other restaurants would have gone back to the chef and asked how the Caesar was prepared. From the taste, it was not the 'new' bottled dressing, the salad seemed to have the oil, egg, worcehestershire sauce and garlic mix of the classic Caesar.  I learned, through my own research that anchovies are not a part of the original Cratini Caesar salad, that was an 'Aviator Salad' with the anchoivies. So Reef N Beef got the 'dressing' right.  They just missed the cheese. I have to admit I was disappointed in the anniversary dinner I had because I was looking forward to more.  That may have been my own self-deception, but when I saw the 'new additions' to the menu of pizza on the dining room side, I couldn't help thinking ... what's happening to this restaurant? The sheer quantity of food was very impressive,  with the entire meal consisting of soup, salad and entree with vegetable and choice of potato on the plate not a la carte for one price.   That brings me to Quesiton 2 and 3. Should a stuffed potato be tasty enough on it's own not to have to add sour cream, onion bit and 'real' bacon bits because they are 'free'? For prime rib, no matter how good the gravy (and Reef N Beef gravy is good!) should it not be offered as a side?   I prefer my prime rib with  horseradish if given a choice, but my prime rib came topped iwth gravy which made me wonder.   The quantity of  the food was well worth the price ... the quality ... not so much.     We'll go back to the lounge for steak sandwiches, and maybe the new pizza on the menu, it looked pretty good walking back into the lounge.  Next anniversary, though,  for an upscale meal, we'll choose another restaurant."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed. The waiter was snooty. The place was pretty empty on a Friday night so I don't know how they make any money. I ordered the prime rib, medium, it was tough. The broccoli was undercooked and the carrots greasy. I had the soup and salad for an entree the soup was a way too salty onion soup. The Caesar salad had a ton of garlic in it which I like, but it was drenched too much in it and not really authentic. I wouldn't go again, it wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"I'm in love with this cute restaurant.  I reminds me of another time. When dining was an experience.  It's amazing when you order a meal you get soup and a salad and sides included. best streak Neptune ever. Caesar salad bread and French onion soup were all made perfectly veggies were great perfect service check this place put folks it's a bit dated inside but does well with the theme of great food and service as it hard to find in this time"}
{"text":"Reef 'n Beef is located in the Rundlehorn Drive area NE of Calgary.  Its one of those places you would miss if you didn't know exacty where it was.   A colleague told me about this place because she lives close by.  She raved about the $5.95 steak sandwich. I couldn't believe my ears when she said FIVE DOLLARS AND NINETY FIVE CENTS steak sandwiches so I had to see for myself.  There are two different areas, the dining area which is more formal and the lounge which is...a lounge. We sat in the lounge.  Our server was pretty nice and the chairs are comfy.  We, of course went for the steak sandwich each.  When the steak sandwiches arrived, I was pretty surprised, there was a piece of toast, steak on top and a nice portion of fries.  I got gravy (which I believe is an extra cost). *SEE PICTURE* Of course you can't expect a steak from the keg.  The steak was ok, I mean $5.95 you can't really expect anything spectacular, but it was seasoned nicely and the fries were deeeelicious!  Nice and thick with lots of potatoe and a hint of crunchiness. YUM.  The gravy is nice, it tastes homemade, but who knows!  I've only been to this place for the steak sandwiches, but its definitley a place I would stop by again and try something else.  But!! Its a MUST to try the $5.95 steak sandwich, I mean.......$5.95 need I say more?!     Ps. Happy Hour Daily from 3pm - 8pm."}
{"text":"I expected this place to be a bit of a dive but it's not and actually reminds me of Smuggler's Inn.  What a massive restaurant.  Overall, the decor is okay but the restroom could use an upgrade.  The service was friendly enough but rather slow.  It was quite was busy so I don't know if this was the reason or if it was just the server.   I can't believe how inexpensive the food is and you really do get a lot of it.  The soup was great, the salad was okay.  Our group made jokes about the croutons because they were so massive.  Most of us had just a few but my one friend had enough to fill nearly 1/3 of the bowl.  It was crouton overload.  I ordered Veal Parmigiana, which was adequate rather than mind blowing.  My meal was so huge that I had to take home half of the veal.    This isn't quite fine dining, but a respectable stop with reasonable prices.  I'd rather support Reef 'n Beef than your average chain restaurant."}
{"text":"my sister and i went there saturday lunch time...i didnt know that the dining room isnt open. so we went to the other side....i was so surprise the price is lower...so that is a little tip, if you are on a budget, go to that side instead of the dining area.  same portions, some menu are the same. I LOVE their aaa steak its huge the 10oz, holy very very very juicy....yummm and its only like 22 bucks...beats keg for sure  the only difference is that when you are on the other side, you choose either soup or salad. which is fine...still get the garlic bread so it is all good.  the service...superb. cant say anything bad about this place...this will be my regular restaurant.   fyi, my better half is very picky, there is only a handful in his list...reef and beef made it in his list so...try it out you will not regret it...if you order the same as i did that is. i havent tried anything else since i cant get enough of their awesome aaa steak"}
