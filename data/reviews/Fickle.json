{"text":"Interesting name Fickle..hmm..right when you walk in you're greeted with a sign of  $3.50 beer and a glass of house wine for $5. I thought that was pretty funny since it's a restaurant more so then alcohol serving establishment. No food special's? The service was good but the food wasn't the greatest. I ordered the shrimp in lobster sauce, my friends ordered the vermicelli with 3 choices, moo goo guy pan and The Fickle Special. 3 orders had wayyy too much sauce that spread on the plate like some over poured syrup.(which is too bad because the plates and bowls had very nice shapes..too much sauce ruined the colours and presentation) By no means is the food a must have..it's a\"i'm starving and it'll do.\" As for the decor, it's quite interesting a full sheet of stenciled hearts cover's the ceiling, walls and pillars. I disliked the constant change of colour which is distracting to all. Good service! Too bad the food can't make up for that..."}
{"text":"My family and I happened upon this place by accident while looking for a place to eat while on vacation in Toronto. I must say this place stands out from the rest of the other restaurants along Yonge because of it's unique design (modern interior and exterior).  We decided to give this place a try, and we are so glad we did. The menu offered a good amount of appetizers & entrees. Once we ordered, the food came out in modern dishes (didn't have to wait long), and it looked and smelled delicious. And it totally was.  The pho was excellent and they offered a good amount of it.  As experts in Vietnamese cuisine, my parents recommended it. Fickle's Thai and Chinese cuisine were also just as good.    The ambiance and staff were great, too. The decor was completely chic and modern (even the utensils used). The lights change color every couple of hours which was cool.   We had a waiter who was super friendly. He was kind enough to let us know more about the restaurant and what events were happening around town, so that we could enjoy more of Toronto.   Overall, my family and I enjoyed our dinner there, and we would love to go there again when we are in Toronto."}
{"text":"Love, love, love, their pho! Feels upscale, nice for a drop in. Beautiful at night when they turn on the lights."}
{"text":"NOT in love with this place...  We went a few months ago, and weren't too impressed. The test for a good Vietnamese restaurant, in my opinion, is to try their Pho and spring rolls. Neither were that impressive, just extremely average. The decor is funky, I suppose, if white/silver glossy swirly print is your thing. I don't know what more to say, except pass. No love - sorry."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant on my last visit to Canada and I have to say it has become one of my all time favorite restaurants! The decor is very eye catching and nice, but the food is the best part. What I would recommend if you decide to come here would be the pineapple fried rice, general tso chicken, and the seafood delight!"}
{"text":"The food is the only good thing - and it is really good, which is why I went back to this place 3 times despite how weird it is. I'll start by saying this is honestly the ugliest restaurant in the world. I'm honestly surprised that I even tried it because I get a headache just walking by - the lights are seizure-inducing.   However, I can stomach the bad deco style but cannot get over the horrid service. There are always at least 2 dirty tables when you come in (and when you leave....sometimes they are the same tables). The last time I was there the two employees sat behind the bar complaining about their manager (the owner?) the entire time we were eating - loud enough for us to hear. I've never been brought my bill or had my plate cleared - every time I've had to go up to the front to pay.   I'll probably just start getting take out...."}
{"text":"I had a simple beef noodle pho here. I appreciate that they provide extra basil and sprouts on the side for you at add as you see fit. I find it Strange that in Toronto pho always comes dressed by the kitchen!  I'm still on my hunt for some GREAT pho in Toronto, but if I'm near by and totally starving/craving pho I wouldn't be adverse to going again. The interior was really clean and stylized and the server was really sweet."}
{"text":"The terrible choice in decoration and the super confused menu of ALL asian foods made Fickle a place I had no expectations with.  Seeing as it was a viet restaurant (apparently) I had to try how good they could make pho. positive: portions were AWESOME if you are hungry and willing to eat anything. a decent amount of meat and large bowl of noodles and soup.  negative: no siracha sauce, bean sprouts, basil leaves, limes and all the TYPICAL viet sides you put in pho. their personal hot sauce came in some crappy decorative sauce container that wouldn't allow it to come out properly.  also most people there ordered chinese food and apparently enjoyed it. so if you want to come to a Vietnamese restaurant to eat chinese food, you should come to a place called \"fickle.\""}
{"text":"It's alright. The d√©cor is definitely what got me. Many times I've passed by here before thinking it would be a very interesting place to dine. It's quite quirky indeed!  The food was ok. Westernised pan-Asian cuisine. Nothing exceptional but still a decent dining experience.   Disappointed that they did not provide any tea for free, though. Pretty much any self-respecting East Asian restaurant will serve you tea as they would tap water.. at no extra charge."}
{"text":"We stumbled on this place after Pride and were surprised it wasn't crowded. The decor is nice - clean and modern. The walls are covered in hearts and the seats are white comfy leather. The waitress knew a lot about the dishes and was happy to recommend favorites. She was very attentive and friendly.  The food was really good too, for a good price. I had the sizzling pork and rice. The pork was very flavourful. Others had golden curry chicken (pretty good, nothing special), cantonese chow mein (very large portion, tastes good) and lean beef Pho (pretty typical, not bad).  There were a few mix-ups on our order. We got some things we didn't order, and the plates didn't all come out at once, otherwise I would given it a 4 star.  We will most likely be back."}
{"text":"Great food! Ordered wayyyyy too much of it as we thought the portion sizes were smaller. Either way, had the pan fried dumplings (delicious!), fickle special (what a gigantic portion!!! ...could've used more sea food in it though), general tao's chicken, which was great! We also ordered pineapple fried rice (actually served in a pineapple which I thought was neat!), and spring rolls which were also good.   Service was great, our server was very friendly. Obviously the atmosphere is great too. Overall, awesome experience and ill be  eating their food for the next 3 days with all we brought home lol"}
{"text":"One of the worse dining experiences I have her had, ever, anywhere.  My friends and I were in Toronto and had passed Fickle a few times because of it's proximity to our hotel.  We decided to come for lunch because of the great lunch menu posted outside and had a special 10% off all orders for their grand opening.  We arrived at 11:45am only to find the restaurant was closed. I checked the business hours and they should have been open at 11:00. While we were chatting outside trying to decide where to go for lunch, someone shows ups and unlocks the door. I asked why they weren't open yet, and she said they changed their business hours and are not open to 12pm. When I pointed out the time on the door, she said that they had posted the new business hours, but someone stole it.   Before our asses even hit the seats, our waitress informs us that the lunch special will not be honored today and that the 10% off is only for take out orders.  We were there on a Sunday, but the menu did not specify that the lunch specials were only valid on weekdays, and the entire window was painted with this 10% ALL orders special.  This put me in a sour mood because I hate when businesses are intentionally deceptive.    I placed an order for tamarind chicken wings, but was told they no longer offer it. I told them I saw it on the menu outside, but I was informed that they had already printed several new menus since then. So you've printed new menus, but have opted to not be upfront about your lunch specials and 10% grand opening special?   This is so not about the few bucks we would have saved, but I felt like they were intentionally being very deceptive.  We ended up ordering their appetizer platter and hot pot.  The first item I tried on the appetizer platter was their fried shrimp, I took one bite and immediately realized it was completely RAW. Not only was it raw, it had not been cleaned at all.  This was sent back   The hotpot was not even hotpot! It was a very thick and gelatinous stew. I was not in the mood to eat at this point but I was starving. I put a meatball in my mouth and immediately spit that out - also RAW. We paid the check, left a $1 tip, and left to find some cooked food.   my advice is  : DO NOT EAT HERE"}
{"text":"Bad service. The servers started complaining about the tip. It was not just the waitress but also the floor manager that started the argument. It's for the customer to decide how much to tip.  This is how you chase your customers away. Last time I went to this place."}
{"text":"Terrible wait  45 minutes we walked out before the main dish was even ready after waiting 45 mins.with no entree. 2 people handling the whole place-ridiculous-even they having to handle phone and handle the cash. And they said they were not understaffed. place is nice-sort of cheap chique. Back to the Golden Turtle for us and tearing up my $10 WagJag-this place was too irritating-there is enough good competition ,even more reasonably priced,to be able to visit."}
{"text":"if i can, I won't even give it a single star... Yes, it is THAT bad.   Worst dinning experience to date. Went on a Saturday night, 9:30, place was not full. I did not expect an extremely long wait time for a bowl of pho (approximately 45mins) all of my 3 friends have finished eating, I chased the waiter twice. When the food came, he gave the lame excuse \"Handled by different department\" (wtf!?!?! they have only 1 kitchen). Waited for my food so long, and my friends then have to wait for me to finish eating... which delayed all our plans for the night. The make matter worst, the pho had missing ingredient, didn't have beef tripe like it said... i was just so annoyed with them, i just want to eat and get out of there. I also asked for hot water, which never came.. instead cold water came... One of my friends that night ordered a Mango Chicken dish, the waiter asked her if she wanted rice or noodles... and she picked rice. When the bill came, we were surprised to see she was charged for the rice because by the way the waiter asked, she was under the impression that the rice was included. We felt deceived. The owner took it off after we argued but the feeling of deception lingered. Despite, the LONG wait for my food, the deception, the bill did not have a single percent of discount, not a single complimentary item. We paid the bill but NO TIPS! we are NOT tipping for this kind of service or sneaky money making ways. There are WAY more better restaurants for this type of food out there, you don't need to go there. there is nothing special about their food."}
{"text":"Both the decor and the ambiance in this place are great. It's clean and pretty. Cute even.  The food is fresh and well prepared.   The price is right at lunch time - 8.00 for all the lunch specials. I found the pho to be overpriced in the menu - but then again, I didn't try it so perhaps it's worth it.   It loses marks in being truthful in the menu though. I order the mango chicken because it was supposed to have lots of veggies in it, such as peas, carrots, and eggplant. It came with peppers and onions. Full stop. And although the menu says fried rice, be prepared for steamed. This is fine because it's tasty. But I would suggest they re-write the menu if they aren't going to be true to it.   Service was slow-ish but I was with a large group and they said the insurance inspector was in the kitchen. Very friendly staff though. I'd go back for lunch for sure, and dinner perhaps."}
{"text":"This place is definitely eye catching.  Must have walked by this place 5 times & couldn't help but think how cool it looked on the inside.  Finally, I said, we have to go here! I really enjoyed the food.  I had the red curry, and was very pleased, this dish had very good flavor.  The atmosphere is really different since your surrounded by glowing hearts, with all white tables and chairs.  Glad I stopped in!"}
{"text":"Went there with another person a couple of months ago, because I thought why not check out this new place... They had pad thai on the menu so this is what attracted me to go inside.   Anywho, we sat down, ordered our food--I specified no egg in the pad thai as I'm allergic, and we had asked for water to drink. The waiter completely forgot about the water and cutlery. More people had come in at that point, and it must have been almost twenty minutes later when the waiter was in our area again, so we could ask for our missing stuff.  The people who ordered after us got their food first... then when we finally got ours, there was egg in my pad thai... had to send it back, so that was somewhat bothersome.   In conclusion, terrible service, average food quality, weird atmosphere. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Tried here because of the proximity to home, don't like the decor. Had the Pho and is was not good. Broth was bland and kind of sweet and not in a good way, which is weird to me . Pho is not supposed to be sweet! Also did not come with sides of bean , basil, lime and fresh chillis. Do not like."}
{"text":"Ok food. Expensive for what it is. So so service"}
{"text":"Pho needs improvement. Price range is above average for a bowl of pho."}
{"text":"Went here Saturday night with my friends. Cute little restaurant with very friendly and attentive staff. Our waiter was awesome, he was funny and made it a great experience for us. We had a delicious pitcher of sangria which was on special for $13.99 (awesome deal!) and the Pu Pu platter. The only thing from the platter we didn't like was the satay chicken, tasted a bit too salty. Absolutely loved the crab rangoons so we got another order. We also ordered the deep fried dumplings, not the greatest dumplings, left a weird after taste in my mouth. Overall, we had a great time and we will definitely visit again for the crab rangoons and cheap pitcher of sangria."}
{"text":"Close but...  I think this could be a quite good restaurant if they got their act together but it was't today. Tom yum soup was scalding hot bad had chunks of raw tomato which didn't work, spring rolls were good but the sauce was much too sweet, and the entre was nothing like the description in the menu. In fact the waitress told me the menu was full of errors (which I filed under \"too little, too late\").  If the place is still open in the fall I may give it another chance."}
{"text":"Yummy pho, and great delivery delivery service! Be sure to tip the delivery lady well - she uses a bike to deliver!"}
{"text":"What an awesome restaurant!  Food: Many Westernized Asian plates that are rich in flavour and spices  Drinks: Not too overpriced as they often have drink specials. The drinks are really strong (especially their martinis)!  Atmosphere: It's usually half full, has tacky white decor and plays great music (top 40s).   Price: Very decent; plates are usually between $10-17.   Service: Fast and polite.   HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE! I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Brand new, gleaming white with hearts everywhere, I can see why people like this place!    Fickle In Love is a new Viet-Chinese spot at Yonge Wellesley/College. Yonge street badly needed a decent Vietnamese place... and Fickle is decent.  I saw a lot of patrons ordering the lunch specials. Western Chinese food... sweet and sour... general tao type chicken dishes.    I wanted pho.  The restaurant is still new and working out the kinks. I had to ask them for the regular menu instead of the lunch menu. They do have a pho lunch special that wasn't listed on the menu.  The pho here isn't as cheap as other places ($7-8 bucks). However, the portions are huge! I ordered the regular and it came in a big bowl with lots of noodles and beef.  And, the broth was light tasting and didn't have MSG!  The house spring roll is really crispy and tasty.  I was happy with my pho here and Fickle is now one of my regular lunch spots! =)"}
{"text":"Love this place its ultra modern decor has nothing to do with the type of food but its still cool. Had the beef and veggie pho and the spring rolls. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Went there for late lunch and was pleasantly surprised. It wasn't busy, decor is little like a space ship with clovers everywhere, service was ok little inexperienced but tried hard to make us happy. We ordered red curry one with seafood one with chicken both were very tasty and portions were large. Also we had fried calamari and cold rice rolls both yummy.  Prices are very good the most expensive item on the menue was 14.99 for seafood hotpot.  Import beer in bottles is $4.95 which is unheard of this days.  Over all will go back for more."}
{"text":"the food quality was really bad especially the meats. made me feel sick after.  i also tried my friend's dish and it was just as bad."}
{"text":"I had a vegetarian pad thai and my boyfriend had the red curry with veggies, tofu, and rice.  We also had vegetable spring rolls as appetizers.  I LOVED my meal!  So delicious!  And there so much of it ... I got to take like half of it home!  They accommodated us as vegetarians and got us a different sauce (not the usual fish sauce) for the vegetable spring rolls (which were delicious).  My boyfriend's dish was very spicy - he enjoyed it (I'm not one for spice).  The decor - beautiful!!  Loved the lighting and everything.  The waiter was very friendly and efficient as well.  Also - inexpensive!  The two meals and the appetizers cost $23!!!!  Of course that excludes the tip - but what a great deal.  There were pricier items on the menu but they were mostly for meat, and I don't eat meat.  Lots of great vegetarian items too, I'd love to go back there and try out some of the other vegetarian dishes.  Great place, I would definitely recommend it!  I don't go out to each much but I would definitely return to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Very overpriced for a kind of food that is known to be very affordable. I ordered the pho with beef flank and it was definitely very different from what I've had in the past from other restaurants. The flank was tough and lacked the delicious fat that usually clings on to it and the soup base lacked flavour. I think if I had another food craving I will more likely just walk a bit further over to Ginger which has more standard quality pho with better pricing. Here I just feel like I'm paying for the location and decor as opposed to the quality of the food. I heard there was a change in management though, but I'm not sure whether my visit was pre- or post- change though."}
{"text":"Poor service, mediocre food, and one of those Chinese restaurants that throws ingredients in your dish that aren't listed on the menu. Panda Express could do better, for half the cost."}
{"text":"would be really good if everything didn't taste like fish"}
{"text":"I'm new to this establishment and have only dined here twice, both in this past month, during lunch meet-ups with my friend.  Both occasions have been great!  I've only dabbled in the $8 lunch menu as I definitely don't want to be in a food coma during a workday.  Had a mango salad the first time and the Buddha's delight the second time.  Happy to say that I enjoyed both dishes, they were complete with a good portion size and were quickly served, ideal when you have a set lunch hour.  Decor is kinda whimsical.  Service has always been prompt and friendly.  I like how there's a nice variety in the menu, ideal for a fickle eater like me who tends to lean towards indecisive at times.  Next time we're here again, I'm gonna check in for the free spring roll!"}
{"text":"This place feels more like a lounge or VIP section of some glam club than it does a vietnamese restuarant.  The food was quite delicious, especially as I had no idea what to expect. For a group of people with varying tastes, and who are all quite picky, we all enjoyed our shared platters.   We had:   Fried chicken wings General tsaos chicken beef pho shrimp curry sizzling chicken steamed rice bowls   Other than the only dish that was really vietnamese, the Pho, the dishes were all delicious.  The Pho was okay-not great.   Overall a decent place to check out, if for nothing else than the atmosphere.  Prices are reasonable, but dont go expecting to get a great bargain-we had a $20 off voucher and with no drinks it still came to $50."}
{"text":"The ambience here is amazing. The decor really is cute, and to quote a man sitting near us while we were there, \"It's a nice change from the usual traditional Asian restaurants.\"  The food however... maybe it's because I only tried one dish from there, but it was lacking a bit. My friends were satisfied with their meals though.  Give it a try though as I think the decor is worth the visit. The prices aren't too bad either."}
{"text":"Can't tell if they're closed or renovating.  There's no signs posted but everything is cleared out inside."}
{"text":"The food was good.  A bit higher priced than some of the other pho and chinese restaurants on Spadina, but in this location - it's not too bad.   But, I cannot stand this strange lighting. Full of hearts, the lights abruptly change colour form soft pink, to a harsh blue, to a light yellow every 15 or so minutes. It was light and dark and very distracting.   The service wasn't amazing either, but if you flag them down, they will come to you.   Fickle in love, was just fickle."}
{"text":"Came here today for lunch around 1pm (Saturday). It was pretty quiet and only a few booth seat tables were occupied. I got voucher for this place weeks ago and decide to try it today. I also passed by before and love what they did with the decor/lighting. However, reviews here seems average so I didn't have much expectation for the pho (I'm Chinese and when I'm at Vietnamese restaurant, I tend to choose something that's classic Vietnamese like pho). Another table ordered Chinese dishes and as a Chinese, I think I get the most authentic and better value in Chinatown. When I go to Vietnamese place, I want to know if they could do their classic pho right.  I ordered the 'Fickle Special pho' for $9.99. Service was quick (I'm glad it didn't take more than 5 min to put together pho) and the bowl was pretty big. I usually order 'medium' when I go to places in Chinatown so I think this bowl is equivalent to a large. I normally can't tell if a soup uses MSG, but I do like this soup because it's actually quite tasty and not overly salty like some places on Chinatown. As for the contents, by comparison to Chinatown (where I usually go for pho because I live downtown), I find you get more of everything in one bowl; more pieces of beef, brisket, beef balls, tendons, tripes and even pieces of onions. Other places I usually just get 2 of each. Also, the quality of these pieces are better IMO. The brisket tastes beefier and juicer and not thin and dry. The pieces of tendons were bigger and thicker. So overall, this bowl of pho I had today exceeded my expectation. Although it's about $2 more than a typical large bowl of pho on Spadina, I think the value was there and I would come here again for their pho.  Decor was also quite nice. Since the place is relatively new, everything feels very clean. Although I didn't come in at night, the changing light color was still nice during the day. The drinking glasses were shiny and spotless. The only thing that I find a bit strange at first was the menu they use for dine-in customers are paper ones just like a takeout menu and that you get a pair of disposable chopsticks that's wrapped in plastic. Just a little different compared to Chinatown pho places. But I guess at least you won't have to worry about holding a sticky plastic menu or chopstick that weren't washed properly :)  I also used the washroom so I might as well review on that too while I'm here.  I think they did a pretty nice job for the washroom. Usually with these places, you probably find something that either sticky or smelly or that not much effort had been made in terms of decor. But their washroom (1 person only) is quite nice and maybe even elegant IMO for a restaurant. Generally black and white, the wall tiles was kind of interesting as they got dimensional patterns on them. The mirror frame was assembled with small black tiles, cheap pink soap were not used. The paper towels and toilet papers were the soft types, like you'd use at home, and not some industrial paper stuff. The soap container and paper towel holder were stainless steel finish and there's also a nice bottle of purple color sanitizer available. There was also one of those handle bar installed beside the toilet for those who need some assistant, which I thought was considerate and good attention to details.   So based on my experience today, I am not sure about their other items, but the house special pho was quite good. I give Fickle a 4 star and would come back again."}
{"text":"The food is average, service isn't the best (I ordered a chicken dish, and got beef instead). It's located in the heart of downtown Toronto, close to the Village.  Besides the decor, there isn't much to write about. I prefer Spring Rolls by Yonge and Charles over here any day."}
{"text":"My friend was having a DUMPLING PARTY and each of us was to bring dumplings and / or fillings and we could prepare and cook at the party. I tried on three different occasions at making dumplings earlier in the week and with not much success. So I went down the street to FICKLE to get some dumplings to take to the party. Which were fantastic I ordered the steamed shrimp and pork dumplings. And yes I told people at the party i bought them !   The decor inside is very cool - love the wall/ceiling laser cut metal panel / lighting effects. I've been here for lunch a couple times and it's very quite and the food ROCKS!!!!   I've always wanted to go in for dinner, but every time I go by it's packed. It's only been open a couple months and hoping in the next few weeks I can push through the crowd and have dinner.   The menu is fantastic, lots of Chinese and Vietnamese offerings. All of the staff were helpful and very friendly.  Glad this is only steps away from where I live as I think I will be here often."}
{"text":"Pan-Asian restaurant with the tackiest decor (wall-to-wall-to-ceiling full of heart-shaped cut outs) in Toronto by far. Food was typically average (meh) for a Yonge Street eatery. The cut of meat in the pho was decent, but the broth had no depth and was overpowered by the taste of onion.  The mango salad was also timid - where were the basil and coriander so crucial to these dishes? Service was fine when I went, but the place was 80% empty."}
{"text":"I was really excited to go to this new spot because they did such an amazing makeover of the interior of this shop. While I did enjoy the atmosphere in dining there, the service was marginal and the food was poor.  We followed the recommendations of our waitress. The crab creamcheese wontons were excellent! I ordered the Vermicelli combination plate choosing lemongrass chicken, beef, and spring rolls. Unfortunately, the beef and chicken were the fatty tasteless variety combined with the lack of garnishes made this dish disappointing. My companion ordered the General Tao Chicken, which turned out to be flavourless deep fried chicken with a side of streamed broccoli. So, the majority of the meal was disappointing.  Following dinner, I've had indigestion which is the rarest for me.  Will not return sadly :("}
{"text":"Good customer service. D√©cor is nice. Had the lunch special. Quantity was good but was not too happy with the taste of kung pao chicken."}
{"text":"So my boyfriend had made mention that this new place was opening up called Fickle just down the street from us. We waited and waited and waited....everytime we passed by something else was up and the place looked like it was going to be super sweet!!  We finally made it in yesterday and i was just thrown back by how cool the restaurant is! It has a pink back lights but while we were sitting inside and it started getting later they changed the lights to blue...gave it a nice late night feel. The servers are super nice and always make sure your food is good. The table sitting behind us, i overheard the server tel the guy \"sorry it took so long, they made your dish but my manager said it wasnt good enough so they re-made it\" I was torn by this comment...sucked he waited BUT at least he knows hes getting what he should be. I guess because they are new management wants nothing but the best to come out.  So the menus are cool, they are of a tabular design and the menu is overbearingly large. Its all the typical Viet and Chinese dishes, so i went with Pad Thai (as usual) and the bf got Red Thai Curry. Now if your wondering why i always get pad thai, is because im determined to find the best Pad Thai in the city! once i find this i will start to order new things haha  So the food is actually really good. Ive stamped Viet Thai in mississauga to have THE BEST Red Thai Curry that we have found by far, but this place may lead in second. The curry was creamy and full of flavour. Would have liked a little more heat in it but it for sure stepped up to plate. The Viet spring rolls we had for and app looked different then the dozens of Viet spring rolls ive had in the past but they for sure lived up to the flavour that we all know and love. The Pad Thai taste like Viet Thai mississauga which is also good. It had the right amount of sweetness to it and full of flavour. Not spicy at all but really filling. Very delish!  Overall the decor is super cool (check my pics i uploaded of it) and everyone tat walked by the place was staring into the window, i think this is for sure going to be a hit. Especially cause almost all the businesses around it looks like crap so it stands out even more.   Good Luck Fickle... i will be back for more!"}
{"text":"I got takeout and just have to say this place looks awesome! they really went all out with the decor  I love it when someone opens something classy"}
{"text":"Pretty decor, Pretty atrocious food.  Cold,flavorless Vermicelli noodles with what amounted to a flavorless wad of cabbage and carrots.  Grease soaked Spring roll, grease soaked fried slices of tasteless chicken and flat, garlicky sticks of pork passing as meatballs.  Topped with bitter burnt garlic and green onion.  Disgusting would be putting it kindly.  STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"Short and Sweet Review!!  Food: The food court at any mall sells food that's better than this!!!  Service: I had do my own transaction on the debit terminal and get up to get a pen. Took us 15-20 to place our order but the food came out in 5 min!! And they charged us different prices than indicated on the menu.   Decor: \"Full of sound and fury signifying nothing.\""}
{"text":"The food at Fickles is average at best. The portion sizes are good (on the larger size). However, the food is subpar and tastes like cheap Chinese takeout that is so common with many other Asian restaurants on Yonge Street.   What was really disappointing, however, was their dessert menu. My girlfriend and I ordered Fickle's Belgian chocolate cake. In hindsight, we probably shouldn't have had high expectations on this sort of dessert as this is an Asian restaurant afterall. However, we had a TeamBuy coupon and had extra money left to order dessert.   The so-called Belgian chocolate cake turned out to be, literally, a 1 inch piece of McCain's \"deep n' delicious\" chocolate cake. I do not understand how the owners here can even think that customers won't notice this. Even the icing design was telling of McCain's. The price of that morsel of cake was the same price as the entire box at the grocery store too.  I would not recommend this restaurant at all."}
{"text":"I went there tonight with a friend. The waitress sat us at a dirty table. I had to ask her to clean it (something that I don't think that I should have to ask). We ordered the food, and the waitress brought our foods without any eating utensils. She grabs two sets of utensils at a four top next to us (who had two customers sitting in it.--Ewwww....). The food was okay. She never asked us how the food was (which was okay), and she brought us the bill without us asking for it.  The food was okay. Too bad the service was bad. The decor is awful. You can find better Chinese food at better prices elsewhere. I would recommend somewhere else."}
{"text":"Got in and then read the reviews and got a bit scared... It wasnt busy at dinner either.  how was it? Id say worth going back. Service was very attentive (except when we wanted the bill); the atmosphere is very kitsch but i like that, every restaurant looks the same modern style...except Fickle. The light changed color while we there which brought a reaction from all the patrons which was funny; food wasnt awesome but good enough for me to come back... And im snobby on chinese food. Had some glass noodles vegetable dish.  So all in all, this place gets a pass. Somewhere a little different."}
{"text":"Decent food, subpar service. I mean don't let people have a real menu if your cook only wants to cook whatever is on the lunch menu.  A friend had to wait an hour to get her non-lunch special meal.  Just horrible...  The hearts in the restaurant are cute though."}
{"text":"Great decor in the restaurant, although I admittedly didn't enjoy it much since I did take out. Had the chicken pad thai which was good, but just a little too sweet for my taste. I'd prefer just a hint of spicy, though I know that pad thai isn't always spicy. The spring roll for their lunch menu was okay, but a bit bland. Great service."}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: Too bad their service is absolutely rubbish because it's fun to eat \"Asian\" food in a space shuttle disco ballroom. :)  This place is weird, kitschy and trippy. White chairs and tables and laser-etched wall cut-outs. A circular bar seating area in the middle of the restaurant surrounding a blossoming vase-like column for no discernable reason! One moment it's white fluorescent lighting, then pink, then green! Cue David Bowie, but hold the LSD (or not).   Also, you want \"Asian\" food? You got it. You can get vietnames pho, thai pad thais and curries, chinese-canadian dishes like general tao's chicken, and hot pots. The house pho was *good* though with very generous servings. The dumplings were meh. And the vegetable curry was standard.  Too bad the service is rubbish though. My friend and I arrived and watched the cashier watch us wait...and wait...and wait until finally a server came out to seat us. Then we waited some more to get our menus and to order, but the worse of it was 20 minutes AFTER ordering my brisket noodle soup, the server came out and informed me that she *just* found out they had ran out of brisket!!! Even the server said it was a disaster and I couldn't have agreed more."}
{"text":"Nothing special.. just your typical chinese joint.. not great and definitely not bad..but nothing beats new ho king though.. the fried rice is really good.. but you could find it anywhere else.."}
{"text":"The food here is below average and the atmosphere quite nice. The problem is below average becomes awful when your prices are higher than the competition. The ingredients they use are fresh but the chef skill is just not there. We ordered the chicken pineapple fried rice, beef lo mein, some other noodle dish and pho. Only the pho was decent."}
{"text":"A Vietnamese restaurant opening up around Yonge and College? I just had to go. Now I went with a few friends on what they call their soft opening weekend (Late review I know). One of the first things you notice about the restaurant is the decor. It is very hard to miss and if anything, it's soo eye catching that you can't help but be enticed into trying the restaurant out. The decor is very modern with laser cut designs which are complimented with multi colour lights that change in intervals ever so often. This place can easily be a nightclub or lounge and they would not have to do anything. The seating is new, sleek and simply nice. High marks for the interior so far.  Now onto the food, their menu is pretty extensive and has more than the typical Vietnamese joint. They have decided to make available multiple other Asian dishes on their menu. So if you have friends that may not want viet, other choices are available. For me, pho is very important to a viet restaurant. It's one of their most distinctive and cornerstone dishes that are available. A large pho ($10) here has 2 options that you can choose as toppings. I chose the rare beef option and the beef flank. My friends also decided to taste out their traditional viet dishes and got their vermicelli. For vermicelli you also get the choice of 3 toppings to your order. In general, the beef, chicken and pork were chosen for our table. We also decided to try their dumplings ($5) as a small app for the table as a taster.  Now the dumplings came out pretty quickly and first impression... it was a little dry. As well the flavour wasn't the greatest. We were all thinking precooked and simply waiting to be ordered. The main entrees came out about 5 minutes or so after. So the speed was definitely welcomed. The pho came in a big bowl and was served hot. I tried the broth first and it was alright. Pretty average and the noodles... they were subpar. They went with a type of noodles that wasn't the typical thin Vietnamese pho dry noodles and not the traditional Chinese rice noodles. It was something in between. I felt that it didn't compliment the dish as a whole.   For my friend's vermicelli, they weren't impressed either. Now we're not the snobby type at all, but coming at $12-$13 for the dish this is substantial more than a lot of viet places in the downtown core as well as other GTA options. A lot of Vietnamese restaurant serve their vermicelli with something that's just slightly thinner than the regular spaghetti type pasta/noodles. They decided to serve the vermicelli with extremely thin noodles. And this isn't horrible as I've had them before and they can work. If you never had vermicelli, there's this fish sauce which is used to pour over the noodles to essentially wet the noodles to give it some sauce. I personally like mixing all the contents before consuming. But my friends felt the toppings were average and didn't like the dish overall. I tried some of theirs and definitely, some changes are required to turn this dish from just average to good. And at $12-$13, this is far too much to pay for just average or... just below average.  Overall, I didn't like Fickle Me Love. There wasn't really much to love beside the decor. Which is really nice and got great remarks from everyone. But the food is expensive for what you get and the quality just isn't there. We do have to give it up for their customer service which was extremely attentive. But this is a restaurant, not a lounge or nightclub where good service and a cool atmosphere is more than enough. We felt rather than focusing on food as the most important aspect, it was kinda an afterthought. Maybe they're still ironing out the details and hope they'll work on their food. But we won't be returning until then, we wanna keep our tummy's and wallets happy. Wouldn't you agree?"}
