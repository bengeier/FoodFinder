{"text":"Don't go here unless you are with a large group...we waited over 40 minutes and were never seated as a party of two"}
{"text":"My favorite Japanese restaurant, for sure!! Fun experience and tasty food! Great for groups-- birthday parties, girls night out, etc."}
{"text":"It was hard for me to rate this place. I am not really a good judge of this style of food. However service, entertainment, prices are great. The food was good but a sauces were just a bit to heavy and salty for my taste. I would rate it better than OK but I am not really a fan."}
{"text":"The only complaint-make a reservation and by far the food is well worth the wait.  I have never went to Japanese where noodles and rice was served with your meal. Vegetables included carrots, mushrooms the norm zucchini and onions.  The staff was great! The food was excellent!"}
{"text":"Family friendly atmosphere. Server Kristy kept our drinks refilled promptly. My teenage son mentioned he would love to have his birthday party here. I guess it passed \"teen test.\" Our party ordered the hibachi chicken. Portions were large and yummy. Easy to get reservations, but needed on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Saturday night: had party for 12 people and were treated poorly. We felt rushed as though they couldn't wait to get us out so the next group could sit down. Food quality was average at best. Would not recommend this restaurant if you want to enjoy a leisurely dinner."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!  This is my place to stop anytime I'm in town.   It's boarder line addictive at best.  The show,  food quality, quantity and environment is perfect whether dinning alone or with others.   I've tried most of the menu and not disappointed once.   Friendly staff!!  I wish to rank them lower for the wait sometimes but it's so worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service! I think this might be my wife's new favorite restaurant.  Sushi tastes fresher than most of the other places in the area, though their selection is a bit limited.  We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Always an amazing experience when we go. Would give it 5 stars but even with reservations there is always a wait. Food is great an the chefs  always entertain. Dinner does come with a shrimp appetizer, soup and salad"}
{"text":"We have eaten here uncountable times typically about 6-8 times a year. And after our experience on Saturday my husband refuses to go back. The portions were tiny, the food had no flavor and the sauces were all watered down. I understand times are tuff but, come on watering down your shrimp sauce, ginger sauce and salad dressing. Made for a less than appealing meal. We always have left overs and for the first time ever we ate all of our food even the rice and was on the verge of still being hungry. Very disappointed and in fact it will take a lot of convincing to get my husband to go back."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi. Tried the spiderman roll and tango roll. Don't get the veggie tempura."}
{"text":"We went to Nakato last night for dinner.  The food was average in taste, much smaller portions and higher prices than before, and the service was not good at all.  We waited a long time for our courses and forever for our check.  My wife had to remind the waiter that she hadn't gotten her sushi order.  We had a coupon and they added 18% for a gratuity, per the coupon, which we didn't see beforehand -- the coupon is a scam so watch out.  We wouldn't have tipped that much based on the above comments.  Our table mates asked for a birthday greeting which never happened.  Yes, we have been eating here for 15 plus years but likely will not return as things have declined so much recently.  No one ever came to our table to ask how things were going -- a sign of poor customer relations."}
{"text":"Far better than it's competition just down the street! I've eaten here many times and have never once had a single complaint! The quality and quantity of the food is fantastic! The sushi is superb! The staff are welcoming and efficient! The only thing I would tweak would be the decor. The carpet should be removed because I've been coming here for years and it's always been the same, and only gotten darker. I realize that seems like no big deal, but I would feel better about the whole experience with a new floor that's easier to clean."}
{"text":"I LOVE their hibachi dinners!  The veggies, noodles, soup, shrimp and fried rice are all delicious.  I'm pretty much addicted to their Yum Yum Sauce (Shrimp Sauce).  I put that on everything.  Definitely not a place to go if you are counting your calories.  I enjoy their hot sake as well.  My boyfriend and I frequent this location for birthdays and anniversaries.  They get packed on Friday and Saturday nights so we always make a reservation to avoid waiting.  Definitely one of my favorite hibachi restaurants!"}
{"text":"Lucky we were there earlier so did not wait.  Food was good and it was fun to look at chef cooking in front of you."}
{"text":"Favorite place to get sushi!  Service is always great. We sit at the sushi bar unless  we take our child   she loves to watch them cook. They are very accommodating. Decent drinks!   Loves the volcano roll"}
{"text":"My husband and I are sushi lovers and we sat at the sushi bar. The sushi chef Jin was very experienced and delivered some delicious rolls and nigiri.. The management was also friendly and conversational, checking on us in addition to our waitress.. We had NO wait time and loved the beer specials! $2.75 Sapporo on thursdays!"}
{"text":"Lesson learned. DO NOT SIT AT THE SUSHI BAR if you are getting food from the grill. This was an impromptu celebration night for us when we decided to go to one of our favorite places but the wait for 2 was an hour and a half. We talked for a second and decided to sit at the sushi bar instead and just order from there. What they don't tell you is that you get half the food if you order there than you would if you sat at one of the regular tables..for $2 less. Not happy that we paid $12 for something I could have gotten for $7 at any other quick Japanese place.   The waitress we had was rude and short. I get that they were busy but they are always crazy busy on the weekend and I've seen her there for years so I know she is accustomed to that. I don't appreciate being told no when we ask for something extra and say we know there is a charge. Because of a diet program, we wanted all vegetables instead of rice and said we knew there would be a charge but she flat out said \"no we don't do that\"...you don't do what, make money on your food? After she said that she turned around and walked away when I was still talking. She dropped off our cold food 30 minutes later and then our check 20 minutes after that. Not once did she check on us.  On top of the terrible service and value, our vegetables weren't cooked and the entirety of our meal was cool to the touch. It will be a very long time before we go back and never again will we sit there, nor will we have her as a waitress. So upset that we wasted our \"cheat\" meal on such a bad experience!  The sushi chef, however, was amazing and so friendly. He was the only bright spot in our meal."}
{"text":"Very busy place for rather mediocre food. We rarely eat at hibachi grills, but decided it sounded good tonight. The food was okay. Life's too short and there are way too many good things to eat to settle for okay!  I think one thing that makes it tricky when reviewing a hibachi experience is that they all basically have the same menu - right down to the salad dressing!  Therefore, comparisons are natural.   I found the soup salty. The salad dressing was okay, but missing something. Rice was good, noodles had a nice garlic flavor and veggies were standard. I ordered the teriyaki steak and it had zero teriyaki flavor. Had the sauce not been visible I would have sworn I got the wrong item. The meat itself did not taste good. It wasn't spoiled tasting, more like a really cheap cut of meat. I only ate about three bites.  In another environment I would have gone so far as to complain, but not here.  The shrimp were good. Maybe most disappointing was the ubitiqous white shrimp sauce. It was very watery and bland:(. Major disappointment as that stuff is the highlight of a hibachi visit!  In sum, the food was filling, but not good enough to come here again.    The positives are that the staff were friendly and worked quickly. The chef gave extra attention to my young son which was kind of him. Portions were quite large.  I cannot imagine complaints about portion size!"}
{"text":"\"Go For Show, Not For The Food\"  We took our son there for his birthday. While they put on a good show that the kids will enjoy, the prices and proportions are horrible. We got there for the early bird special which is chicken and beef for $13.85. Now you get soup, salad, shrimp appetizer, noodles, rice, and your meat. Now heres were they get you. You get white rice or pay $2 more to substitute for fried rice. They give you a little strip of chicken and a little strip of beef. Don't get me wrong, you won't leave hungry, just full from all the filler food I listed above not the meat. The cheapest kids meals are $9 each. My total bill for the five of us was $75 before tip. The waitress let my wife's and my water run out 3 times. We will go back again for special occasion, but will get kids something before hand so not paying $36 for 4 kids meals."}
{"text":"Partytime!  Everyone knows you take your kid to Chuck E. Cheese for birthday parties, well take the grandparents to Nakato! It's loud, fun and they have delicious food. The bar is located in the front (aka the waiting room because lots of large parties come in). They have tables, traditional Hibachi rooms and large tables with the same Hibachi grill. It might be chilly once you walk in, but the flat top heats you up. I went with the family for my grandmother's birthday and we got hibachi meals.  FOOD: You start with some soup, which to me was delicious but to most is probably just salty water with some onions. They also give a small salad. Next up is whatever you want! Each protein is served with veggies, noodles and rice (steamed or fried). Everyone gets some soy sauce and shrimp sauce as well. Seafood, steak or chicken are the main protein choices. I also noticed it's super easy to ask for no butter or oil in your meal so it's very easy to request a low sodium, low fat healthy meal. It was my grandmother's birthday so we got a cake that comes with a very loud sound and painfully american Japanese version of \"if you're happy and you know it.\" Is it just a vanilla cake with some sprinkles? Yeah. Is it amazing and fluffy and light and worth saving room for? Absolutely. You also get a cute picture to take home.  The chefs' talent is really what makes the whole experience. They will interact with who interacts with them. So, please, put the phone down and enjoy the onion volcano they set on fire. It's fun and definitely makes a birthday special."}
{"text":"Pretty yummy! Nakatos is probably my favorite restaurant in Charlotte. I'm a frequent visitor to the university location but I was near the Pineville location and thought I would give it a try. It's a little smaller than the university location but so nice and clean. They have this cute little sushi section with boats that float on water. We were immediately seated on an early Saturday evening. Our server wasn't the best but the food was great and the cook was full of energy. They are definitely quick and efficient. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"overall food and service is what you would expect from a Japanese style steak house. What bugs me, is the fact that they menu is not up to date. We dined at 5:30 p.m. In order to get the early bird special as shown on the menu. When I ordered the early bird special which is a steak and chicken combo, the waitress told me they no longer do the early bird special. I asked her how long they have stopped doing this and she said Oh it has been a long time. But obviously they have not updated their menu to reflect the change in what they offer. So beware the menu does not reflect the true reality at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Terrible service I have been her for 2 hours and no one has said anything ready to leave. I wanted to try something different then kabutos and I was wrong if ever deciding between the two choice kabuto's"}
{"text":"Loved and love this place.. Unique experience. food is great and so is ambiance !"}
{"text":"My family and I went here while visiting North Carolina, and we were very happy. Which started by sitting at the sushi bar which is a note that they put sushi on and you pick it up and choose what you want as the boat goes by. And of course you can always request Sushi from the chef. We requested some and we had some off the boat and they were both fantastic. Not sure who the sushi chef was but he definitely knew what he was doing. After sitting at the sushi bar for a while we went to the Hibachi area for the rest of our meal. The food tasted great the ship was very entertaining and we all just had a really great time. I will definitely be coming back here again."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend, she had a groupon. Normally it was a little pricey so if I go back it would be for lunch. We got a big portion of food. You start with a ginger broth which was surprisingly quite tasty. Then comes a salad w/ a strong ginger dressing, but it grew on me, then u get a shrimp appetizer. You get a shrimp sauce which was really good & a ginger sauce which wasn't great. I dipped everything in the shrimp sauce. Then comes the stir fried veggies which were my favorite. Then the noodles, rice (steamed or fried) the steamed was better. And finally the meat of your choice. I had teriyaki chicken, great flavor. Overall I enjoyed the food & the preparation was entertaining to say the least."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp as we arrived in charlotte 4pm with our 5 yr old and 2 yr old.  Figured they'd like hibachi...we were right!  Service was great, very kid friendly and helpful.  Food was plentiful.  Our table got a freebie of teriyaki shrimp (maybe they do this for all tables?).  Our party had the chicken and steak selections, all good.   2 adults and 2 kids. We were out the door for $85, including a nice tip.  Small kids will love the chef act!  Make reservations!  We did and we were glad."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and loved it. Been to many Habachi grills and this one is high-quality and very good service. I got the steak and chicken and both are very good. The cook had a great personality made the experience fun.highly recommend if you're looking for a good Habachi grill in Charlotte"}
{"text":"Good meal today at Nakatos.  Walked in no wait. Plenty of food and enough to take home.  Hibachi shrimp and steak was great.  Love that shrimp sauce"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here on a Wednesday night because we had a Groupon for $30 worth of food.  The Groupon said to call ahead with a reservation and to  mention the Groupon, so at 6pm I called, and was told the earliest they could take me was 7. I thought it was odd being so full on a weeknight, but fine with the time. It seemed like they were really busy because it was hard to talk to the hostess, who seemed in a rush to get off the phone.   We arrived around 10 til 7 and were immediately seated. We were sat (very close to) a group that was already there at another grilling station. We waited on the rest of our people to get there and I actually felt a little smashed between my husband and a 12 year old from another party. I feel like they had 1 too many chairs for the table.   Our waiter was Quinn. He was pretty nice, but I think he had at least 1 other table, because we saw him few and far between. It seemed like the waitress serving the table next to us was a bit quicker, but who knows what was happening behind the scenes.   I ordered the Teryaki steak, and my husband got the Teryaki chicken. It comes with a shrimp appetizer, soup, salad, vegetables (broccoli, zucchini, carrots, and mushrooms), and white rice (you can get an order of fried rice for $1.75 extra).   I thought the shrimp was good, and the chef did a little trick flipping the shrimp tails into a used bowl, one into his pocket, and one into his hat. This was probably the only time he showed off. The chef at the other table flipped around the egg, where as our chef cracked them on the grill. The other chef, just seemed like he was having a fun time with it, our chef seemed not thrilled.   The steak and vegetables, noodles, and rice were all good. Not great, I think if we were paying full price for this, I would have not enjoyed our $40 bill. We did also try Saki for the first time (not a fan).   We will go back - if we have another Groupon or coupon."}
{"text":"Have been to Nakato for dinner numerous times and have enjoyed it every time. The menu is exactly what you expect at a Japanese steakhouse. The wait staff is friendly and the chefs have a good time while preparing your food. definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"I would have giving it 5 stars but the part service sucked so much... the woman who took our order was rushing and being very pushy so the table can order... the food was great our Hibachi serve was great very friendly and entertaining!!!"}
{"text":"We walked in on a Friday night without a reservation. They were able to seat us very quickly. The service was great and our chef Alan was very entertaining and cooked the food perfectly. I ordered the vegetable dinner and they seriously give you A LOT of veggies! The environment was very comfortable too. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Tonight was a very interesting dining experience. Once I took my seat, the waiter was very kind and polite. While waiting for the chef, I was able to learn a lot about the girl sitting next me. Not because I asked her, but because she talked so loud to the person sitting right beside her.  I found out she is an Ardrey Kell Senior, who does not have a date to Sadie's. She has no idea what to do because her best friend cannot go with just her. She did not fail to mention that one of her other \"friends\" is worried about going to college next year, because she won't apply to any scholarships but does not want her parents to pay for it all, even though they just bought two brand new Mercedes Benz, for a total of 5 cars in their garage. I was also delighted to know she enjoys drinking sprite with a little bit of tequila on the weekends.  Our chef did minimal tricks, but the food was fulfilling. However, the MVP of the night was our waiter. Through all the unnecessary information I heard tonight, he managed to be the most attentive server at a Japanese steakhouse that I have ever had.  The night ended with the 17 year old tequila drinker, bumping into my legs, and instead of her saying sorry, she simply walked away. Perhaps if she wasn't so rude, she could find a Sadie's date ?.  I give this review a 5/5 simply off our waiter Matt. Thank you for making my least favorite experience at a steakhouse, something worth reviewing."}
{"text":"The staff is always friendly and I always leave with a full stomach and a good laugh.   The food always seems fresh and the chef is always interactive with the customers which makes it a better experience especially if you're there for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Went here on a week night around 5:30 and they were surprisingly busy but got us in right away. We ordered sushi appetizers and got them very quickly. The chef that cooked our hibachi meal was very very friendly (more so than a typical chef) and funny! The food was so plentiful and delicious! We ate about half and had enough for another entire meal as leftovers! I would definitely come here again for hibachi!"}
{"text":"Honestly love this place but take out is HORRIBLE I will never ever do take out from here! Dining in perfect but they screw up the orders and make a big deal when they messed up!"}
{"text":"Fantastic.  The bartender was excellent.  Service was great.  Our chef was awesome.  And the food was amazing!  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"All time favorite Japanese restaurant. Hibachi shrimp is my fav... Fried rice is the best ... Never disappoints"}
{"text":"Thursday night is the best night to go. You don't have the huge crowds and the beers are cheaper. We like Nakato's when we want to go somewhere special but have no babysitter. The chef keeps the kids entertained and the food is good. I really like the dragon roll and we usually get edamame for the kids. Another great reason to go on Thursday is the early bird special. You get chicken and steak for a much cheaper price than on the weekend. I also order the spicy mustard sauce for my steak and sriracha for my shrimp. I recommend the fried rice over the white."}
{"text":"Did the hibachi here.  It was some of the best hibachi I have had in CLT.  Our chef was latin american and did some tricks we have never seen before.  Also, he was just damn good at his job.  Food was great and the pricepoint was around $23 a person.  I will def come back"}
{"text":"My visit to Nakato (first time) was on a Friday night.  The place was packed and had a constant stream of people, busy busy.  We had 6:30 reservations for a party of 6 and once everyone arrived we were promptly seated.  They will not seat you until everyone is there.  We were seated around a hibachi station - each station has seating for 8, so we had two strangers at the end of our station (no big, they were nice).  I was a little concerned at the cost of the meal when I was looking at it online, but the amount of food is well worth the cost.  I ordered the teryaki chicken.  You start with an onion broth while the chef is warming up.  Next is the small chilled garden salad served with a pink creamy dressing.  While you are finishing your soup and working on your salad, the chef starts with hibachi veggies (thin sliced carrots, onions, zucchini, mushrooms and broccoli).  Next are hibachi noodles (spaghetti with an oil and garlic ? coating).  Next, if you order fried rice with your meal ($1.75 extra) instead of white rice, the chef does the fried rice and portions it out.  Then the meat is started.  Our table had a variety of steak and shrimp items, which were served first since they cook more quickly than chicken (no one wants rare chicken).  I thought everything was quite good (though my white rice was cold, but that is what I get for not ordering fried rice like everyone else at the table).  All of the preparation is done in front of you by the chef, who puts on a show while cooking.  Very interesting, though I was concerned that I was going to lose my eyebrows when the onion volcano was done.  With 6 people, it was hard to hold a conversation, though not impossible.  If you are catching up with friends, I would suggest getting there early for drinks, or planning drinks and dessert after - once the chef's show starts going, along with all of the tables around you, it is rather noisy.    Our server kept drinks filled.  The chef was quite personable.  I had water to drink, so my dinner before tip was just under $15.  Contrary to what my dinner date told me, you don't necessarily have to take off your shoes, though they do have traditional tables there as an option.    Be warned that your hair and clothes will reek of the hibachi smell, so I wouldn't take a post-meal walk through the woods unless you like bears and wildcats."}
{"text":"I was so excited to make reservations for my boyfriend's birthday at our favorite restaurant. When our party arrived a few minutes ahead of us (to be there early to surprise my boyfriend) the hostess said she couldn't find our reservation and suggested the other Japanese steakhouse down the street.  I know for a fact that I made the reservation, but the hostess argued that I did not. Our party was asked to wait almost 30 minutes past the reservation time due to this issue.    Once seated, the food and drinks were great.  The server and chef were very efficient and personable."}
{"text":"I had been to the University location several times and that one is great.  The one in Pineville, although decent, is not as good.  The food was ok but the chicken was dry.  The sushi was decent.  They have great sanitation grades, but there is some wear and tear on the floors near the tables and throughout the restaurant.  They could use a renovation.  Much prefer the University location.  For Japanese steakhouses in South Charlotte, I'll stick with Fuji at Rivergate.  However, if I 'm on the north side of town, I will go to that Nakato's."}
{"text":"One of my familiy's favorite places to eat. Ever. Armed with this knowledge I was bracing myself for an... interesting experience. Hibachi is generally standard across the board for me. It's not a hit or miss type of cuisine. In terms of the actual hibachi, everyone does the same exact thing with some minor twists here and there, so it's all about the quality of ingredients and service. Lets just say I held my toungue when asked how I liked my meal at the end of the day.  The Service: - A little slow honestly, it took them forever to get my beer (not cool bro) and even longer to come get my order. Friendly people as per the usual, but for some reason they are on asian standard time when it comes to serving you.  The Food: - Standard hibachi food, solid but nothing special. A big plus for me are the portions. They tend to give you larger portions than other restaurants along with the traditional soup, salad, shrimp, and veggies. In fact, this is the only place I've seen that gives you noodles with your dish at no extra cost. Well played Nakato.   The Ambiance - Gotta love the ambiance. My cook was playful and had fun with the kids (which is a must, they love attention). The decor was great, modern with a little rustic feel to make you ease into your surroundings.   Overall, wouldn't jump the gun saying its the best hibachi I've ever had, but I also won't be coming here regularly."}
{"text":"I went with a party and will only discuss my experience with the food. I purchased Teriyaki Steak for dinner. In came a platter with 12 one-inch cubes of steak with no seasoning, no teriyaki sauce, no sauce of any kind. It came with a mound of rice--that was very tasty--but no veggies. And all this plethora of food was $16. Very disappointed that the food is average, beginner chef stuff. Nakato in Pineville needs to take their food to the next level and offer flavor with every bite. Include savory, in-season, seasoned veggies with all meals to help the customer feel they have gotten their money's worth when they pay $16 for a meal. I ended up bringing it home, adding onions, green/yellow squash, and sliced carrots, along with some Chinese teriyaki sauce with a shake of red pepper. Voila."}
{"text":"Food was great and very entertaining to watch. The Shrimp and Chicken was the best. Will go back next time !!!"}
{"text":"Another Japanese grill place. This one has a sushi boat bar. It was Monday so no sushi on the boats.   Ordered three rolls. The Spicy Snow"}
{"text":"The food was okay, but the atmosphere and service was very strange. Our hibachi chef seemed stressed out and rushed. He didnt interact with our table at all which in turn led to a more awkward meal. Even with the flaming onion tower that every hibachi place does, he coulndt do that so he just set our whole table on fire ( literally) and just made noises while doing so. It was strange to say the least. Also the portions were extremely small especially for a hibachi restaurant. All in all i was very disappointed in this restaurant, nothing has changed since the remodel i guess."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great for birthdays, small or large groups, or just as a couple. The price is a bit high but, it's one of the best dining experiences you can have - if you like hibachi style food. The food is just awesome - the chefs cook right in front of you - they put on a little show - it's pretty impressive."}
{"text":"Good Hibachi, MaiTai was fantastic and the service was efficient and family friendly.  I normally go for grown and sexy but I was in for a different vibe.  My girlfriend and I had a baby with us and the environment was perfect for it.  Go early otherwise you may wait for a long time."}
{"text":"I went to this place with my family on a Friday night and it was packed!  We were allowed to be seated faster if we decided Traditional Dining (basically sitting without your shoes).  Although it was interesting, I would probably not do it again.  I do not want to even know what my socks touched on those floors (even though the restaurant appeared pretty clean).    As far service, the waitress was nice and the chef was entertaining (pretty much the same as other Japanese restaurants).  As far as food, it was quite disappointing.  The soup was pretty good, but the salad was pretty bland, I didn't even finish it.  For the main course, I ordered the chicken and the NY strip steak.  When I saw the food right before it was going to be cooked, I could clearly see that food quality appeared sub-par.  The steaks were thin and were not that tasty, especially when I had mine cooked medium-rare.  The chicken was alright along with the rice and vegetables, but it was not memorable.    Overall, this Japanese restaurant was alright.  It's serves its purpose if you are craving Japanese food and do not want to drive far, but it is definitely not a place to go if you want to impress someone."}
{"text":"Overall, a great Sushi restaurant.  Warm towel to clean your hands when you first sit down.  Very attentive service by both the waitress and the Sushi chef.  Quality sushi even though they have a lot of focus on the hibachi table service.  Prices are in line with the quality food you get, so a good value.  Definitely a recommend to try solo or with family for sushi.  I haven't experienced their hibachi tables so I'll leave that for others to rate."}
{"text":"Loved my visit here! I had the veggie hibachi. It was full of flavor and lots of veggies. The chef was super interactive with everyone at the table. He made sure to get to know everyone and if it was their first time. The portions are not  too large and you get noodles with it. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Worst sushi I've ever had.. praying I don't get sick from the crap they served before I sent it back.. yuk"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to eat for birthdays and other occasions.  Love the food and entertainment.  The restaurant stays busy. It's a lot of fun. The one negative is the wait staff. Not that friendly and hard to get their attention."}
{"text":"This experience was not quite as good as the first. Our chef was great but the place was more crowded and besides the wait to be seated, we sat for a while before being served. My glass sat empty not once but twice."}
{"text":"I went with a 2 - 2.5 might be more accurate.....   not a fan of nickel and diming - so to charge a couple of extra bucks for fried rice (at a Japanese place!!!) then not bring you the steamed rice that was supposedly included with the meal is annoying -  but some people will not care about that so let's focus on the food....      I got the shrimp & chicken, the chicken was actually both seasoned and cooked very well (not over cooked and dry) - the shrimp however had so little taste that when I shared with my 4 year old she said, \"is that real food, or are you pretendin'?\"  I said, \"yes - why?\"... her reply, \"because it doesn't taste like anything!!\".   The soup was extra good, the salad average at best (I make a much better ginger dressing)!!!   My daughter said the noodles were good but she also thinks McDonald's nuggets are good......  My wife got steak (strip) and I tried it and it was pretty good...   ALL portion sizes were tiny (except the shrimp appetizer- it was the normal 2 shrimp)..  I was here for a birthday dinner - and sort of glad I came - it reinforces to me that Tsuki is 10x better at minimum -food quality, taste, portion size and price (no nickel & diming)..."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, sushi I'm told is great. Often times a long wait without reservations. Can't say I'd bother if not already in the area."}
{"text":"I really don't care what others may say about this type or even this specific restaurant. No gourmet, nothing fancy, and smoke in the air.....this is our favorite place to eat in Charlotte/ Pineville area.  Soup, salad, shrimp appetizer, noodles, vegetables, fried or steamed rice, and your main course (I always get filet-rare).  My family absolutely loves this place. Always attentive service and chef. Always need a box for leftovers. Plain and simple....relaxing and great fun for the kids.  Side Note: I love the green apple hot sake"}
{"text":"Great experience. We went to celebrate my wife birthday.  Everybody had a good time with great meal. Portion on every dish are plenty. About service  excellent. .!"}
{"text":"You have, I believe, two choices in south Charlotte for hibachi style Japanese food where hibachi chefs prepare food at your table over a top grill. We opted for Nakatos and it was a good choice.  We seemed to feel the food was a bit better tasting.  For example,  the fried rice is prepared with 5 eggs which seems to be a lot more.  The noodles tasted fresher and the meats were well prepared and seasoned.   The appetizer soup was great as it had bits of fried tempura coating in it.  Overall great tasting food (5/5).  Plus you can sit at tables that are traditional as you have to take your shoes off which is cool (5/5). Overall great experience,  highly recommend you give this place a whirl of you're in the area."}
{"text":"Nakato is my favorite Japanese restaurant in Charlotte. I like the filet mignon and lobster. High quality ingredients prepared fresh right in front of you. I really enjoy eating at Nakato!"}
{"text":"The best sushi I have ever had!!! This restaurant is 3 hours away and we will make special trips to eat here. The restaurant is beautiful, the sushi chefs are very friendly and knowledgable, and the servers are quick and attentive. Definitely sit at the sushi bar!"}
{"text":"I've seriously never eaten here and been able to eat my whole meal.  I'm partial to the combination plates, either the steak and chicken or the shrimp.  All three are great choices that you can't go wrong with.  My favorite parts of the meal are the noodles I think.  They are down right delicious probably from the butter used to cook them.  Don't come here on a diet, you will be in trouble.  Another thing to note is it's probably good to get a reservation because the place stays busy.  But if you don't, don't fret.  We recently did an impromptu visit and even though they stated an hour long wait it was really only 30 minutes.  I think they are just managing expectations."}
{"text":"Now the food was Good! On the other hand the service from staff was HORRIBLE!! They were VERY rude and the hosts who greet you at the door are extremely lazy and not to mention RACIST. If you want fried rice with your Hibachi, IT COSTS EXTRA, who does that????If you don't want to serve your customers at least put on a front that you care about those you are serving. At the end of the day, if you want great food they have it. If you want HORRIBLE service from a restaurant trust me NAKATO can provide that for you as well. One Star for Good food and believe me FIRST IMPRESSIONS ARE LASTING. Wont be back! AT ALL!"}
{"text":"We went for dinner with friends. It's hibachi and sushi place.we tried couple of hibachi items sitting in front of cooking place.The food is really delicious.  I have tried shrimp tempura,chicken noodles with mixed vegetables everything is great. In the menu they have different kind of  Asian beers too. it's good place to go with entire family and having dinner."}
{"text":"I didn't really like the good. It didn't have a lot of flavor. I feel like I wasted my hunger, time, and money. Won't go back. The waitress was super sweet however the guy cooking was an ass. When asked if he could remove onions for certain people he said gave a mean look and said too late"}
{"text":"This isn't the best and it isn't the worst in the food department, but for the cost, location, and service, I would much rather spend my hard earned dough at other hibachi places in the area! If you know no other hibachi steakhouses, you'll like this a lot, but if you're accustomed to smiling faces, interactive chefs and higher quality sushi and options, keep searching for another place!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the show, the food, and the company. The soup was a tasty broth. The show started with some shrimp, then noodles and veggies. After that, the main course. For me it was shrimp hibachi (?????????), my friend got steak hibachi. She let me try some of hers and it was good as well. Never had an empty glass and left with a midnight snack. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of the hibachi experience, but it's a fun change of pace when you don't feel like talking during dinner. haha. I always order the vegetarian because I'm usually full by the time the entree is ready. Decent cocktails, ok wine and beer selection. Fun for the kids. There's definitely better Japanese cuisine in Charlotte but this one is good for a Japanese steakhouse format."}
{"text":"Love this place, usually aways busy.  Good Sushi and great Hibachi grill, lobster, chicken, Filet Mignon all great!!"}
{"text":"My dinner group met here because this place has been recommended to me as one of the best Japanese steakhouses in Charlotte and I had to see the sushi boats for myself.   I arrived early and sat at the bar. The bartender and hostess staff is quite helpful.  Our group was seated at one of the hibachi grills. Our server was nice but she was a bit slow and a bit off with some of orders but I think she corrected all but one issue.  Your meal comes with soup, salad and then your entree which is cooked in stages. Everyone gets 2 pieces of shrimp to start off. Then you get your veggies and rice, and then the proteins. The hibachi chef puts on a great show for you from balancing and egg on his spatula to creating a fire in front of you.  The food was great and it's worth the entertainment you receive. On my next visit I want to try the sushi bar where there are boats that circle a bar where you can select your sushi. Sounds like fun."}
{"text":"Service was good but unfortunately food was not. Rice and noodles were VERY bland. Ordered the combo of chicken and shrimp. Nothing special about chicken but shrimp had great flavor. Overall, gave 2 stars because of shrimp. Miso soup was also very delicious and refreshing"}
{"text":"We tried out this place tonight, and overall it was a nice dinner. I will say I was disappointed mostly in the prices. In comparison to other hibachi restaurants nearby, the entree prices were definitely pricier. Word to the wise: entrees comes with steamed rice, but fried rice is an extra charge... which I've never seen a hibachi place do. Our server was very kind and attentive, and our chef was personable and engaging, but overall, I didnt feel the food was worth the price."}
{"text":"We asked our 15 year old where he wanted to go for his Birthday Dinner and he said a Japanese Steakhouse.  We've been to both Nakato and Kabuto and both are good, but Nakato stands out a bit more for us so that's what we decided on.  We arrived at 5pm on a Sunday night and didn't expect much of a wait so imagine our surprise when the waiting area was full and they said it was a 45 minute wait.  Oh well, it was what it was AND it was my son's bday so we waiting...and waited....and waited.  Finally, after 50 long minutes, they called our name.    We were seated in the \"traditional\" teppanyaki room and that was a first for us.  We loved it!  It was a bit awkward to get into, but worth it.  I've been trying to watch my weight so instead of the massive feeding frenzy of the traditional hibachi meal,. I had a bowl of the Onion Soup, a side of Edammame and the Tuna Tataki appetizer (portion was entree-sized!).  All of it was very good!  My family had the steak and chicken hibachi meals and loved it all.  My son especially loves the \"Yum Yum\" sauce (the pink sauce) and has me convinced that he would eat \"anything\" if he could dip it in Yum Yum sauce!    We opted for the $10.00 birthday package.  The package included a birthday cake (Pepperidge Farms vanilla cake) with a candle, a family photo in a souvenir cardboard frame (came out awesome, BTW), and the waitstaff sang Happy Birthday in English and Japanese.  Well worth the $10, in my opinion!"}
{"text":"We went on a Friday night at 9:15pm for hibachi.  The server was SLOW, and we were getting impatient, but once we got the order placed and the cook arrived, the rest of the meal went smoothly and it was tasty.  I will say that they seem to have greatly increased the portion of noodles and greatly reduced the portion of vegetables both in the fried rice as well as the side dishes in the main meal, which was unfortunate."}
{"text":"The food was great! I had the steak and shrimp, and it was awesome. The atmosphere is casual. I loved seeing the chef cook the food in front of me."}
{"text":"Good food and great service!"}
{"text":"Now don't get me wrong I love the food, and the chef/cook was great entertainment. They also had a decent special when I went, I got the chicken and shrimp which was good, my hubby got the steak and chicken and he finished his plate so I'm assuming he enjoyed his too. We also had a couple cocktails that were pretty good too. Its a cute little place too, no different than any other but its still nice. I think their tables are a little small though. I felt like I was so close to the couple next to me. I suggest you go on a rainy day or make a reservation because when we went we ended up waiting like 20mins before we were seated and it was just jam packed. They also have a small parking lot."}
{"text":"12 minutes before sever came to get our drink order had to go tell hostess to get us a server. Before I got to her she spoke loud enough 25ft away Saying \"your server is on his way\" after seeing me coming. Then the server arrived and took drink order and said to make it easy are you ready to place your entire order? Very poor experience"}
{"text":"I came with family on a weeknight, no wait, though most tables were full. A few members wanted hibachi, so I sat at the grill even though I was eating sushi only. This review is mostly for the sushi - which I've definitely had better for the price. I got the hot lava roll, the hope roll, and the dragon roll. The hot lava roll was described to have scallops on top, but I couldn't taste the scallops or really anything on or inside the roll because it was drenched, and I mean drenched in mayo sauce. And this was at least $13... just no. The dragon roll came with only 4 pieces? Not sure if that was a mistake or just my fault not reading the menu. Perhaps I just ordered the wrong things but I wouldn't come here again for sushi. The hibachi looked good; the chefs are talented and put on a semi-entertaining show. However to be priced at almost 20 dollars... it's not that much food. Service was fine. But overall not worth it for me."}
{"text":"We took our friends to dinner here last week. They are moving to Germany and they chose this restaurant.   I don't normally like hibachi food, but I was very impressed with this place! The entire experience was just really fun. The waitstaff is extremely professional,  and the chef did little things to make the kids laugh.   I did not eat any sushi as I don't enjoy it, but the shrimp and chicken was high quality and seasoned well. I ordered the veggie dinner, and with the noodles and rice I was stuffed to the brim. We also had ice cream and some fried banana type of dessert. This will be one of our new go to places!"}
{"text":"I've been to Nakato several times and it has been a great experience every time.  This is on the top of my list and totally convenient to our house."}
{"text":"Best hibachi spot in Charlotte. Been around for years. Does not have an over the top show with dinner. Which I am okay with, a few tricks are plenty. Food is always fast and fresh. Staff is always friendly. Great family spot."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Japanese Steakhouse that we have ever been to.  It is always crowded, so make sure to make reservations well in advance.  We eat here at least once a week, and I recommend trying to eat here if you can on Sunday at lunch.  That is the only day they are open at lunchtime, and the prices are much cheaper than usual, plus the fried rice is included.  We all went just last night, and couldn't have asked for better shrimp, tender chicken, and perfectly cooked steak.  The kids love the onion soup, and salad they give you as an appetizer.  They don't care for the ginger they put on their salads, so they substitute shrimp sauce for the dressing.  The show the chef puts on while making your meal is very entertaining.  We enjoy the way the in which the meal is  prepared, and the order in which they prepare it.  They start off by giving you a two shrimp appetizer.  The noodles are to die for.  I always order two orders of them!  I've never had noodles cooked anywhere like they cook them at Nakato's!  They give you huge portions, so be prepared to leave stuffed, or with a box to go!  I highly recommend this restaurant for the food, the service, and the great entertainment.  It is a little pricy, but well worth it once you've tried the competition."}
{"text":"Excellent Japanese Food!  Our favorite:  Hibatchi Chicken & Shrimp!  The food is fresh and their fried rice is amazing. The sushi is pretty good too, we usually get two rolls to share as our appetizers.  The service is great too.  This has easily become our favorite go to spot when craving hibatchi."}
{"text":"What happened to the days of good Hibachi Steakhouses? I had to give one star for the following reasons: 1. They charge $1.85 for rice. You can get steamed white rice included with the meal. Generally it's the fried rice included but nope. Don't be surprised when your bill is $1.85 more than you expected. 2. Our chef threw his utensil across the table in the first 3 mins of his cooking. -__- 3. I told him I'd like to not have noodles. He said, \"you still have to pay for it.\" -I know sir. 4. When flipping the chicken, he threw a whole tender sized piece onto the table. Just left it there...didn't get another piece. Too bad to the folks getting chicken. You're just short. 5. Luckily I got shrimp. It was extremely dry, unluckily.   My table's experience was bad. Hopefully it was just an off night, but I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I was super disappointed with our celebration meal here. Our waitress seemed like she was very distracted and couldn't crack one smile. She seemed annoyed that we wanted them to sing Happy Birthday to our FOUR YEAR OLD son. The chef was nice but he seemed pretty tired. It was such an uneventful evening. The food was just okay. The salad looked bad & you have to pay extra for fried rice here...really...it's RICE. We will not return. We had a better experience at a Nakato in University area surprisingly. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Great restaurant and people.  The wait was a little long, but the place seems to be very popular.  We met several who were regulars--the wait staff were great. I love hibachi grill, this place did not disappoint.  You go for the show at the grill, and they give you plenty--my girl friend ended up taking a doggy bag.  Several parties, celebrating birthdays and anniversaries!  Great place for the family.   I heard their sushi is great, so will have to go back to give a try."}
{"text":"After several years, and two recent visits Nakato is still a solid 4 stars! From the servers, always friendly and several around to assist with everything, to the food and entertainment. The menu has a wide variety of items, including sushi, which definitely accommodates any customer. And, expect a lot of it...most people leave with to go boxes. One thing to keep in mind, depending on what time you go, expect a 30-60 minute wait. But there is a large waiting area with a nice bar to grab a drink."}
{"text":"Decent prices, good food, portions keep getting smaller....but the kicker is the horrible service you'll receive! We always give places more than one shot, especially if their food is good...but every time we go we are so disappointed at the service!  The chefs are nice and entertaining, especially for kids, but their servers don't seem to care and ruin the tip (which they split)  This last time, we went on a Friday round 6. Moderately busy, but seated right away. Our server seemed so bothered by us, never saying you're welcome when we thanked it (it was more if a grunt/irritated \"ya\") and the portions were much smaller. I swear, the more people at a table, the smaller the portion. If you get served last, expect to be jealous of the first persons huge serving.   They charged an extra $1.75 for fried rice, which I don't mind but I do expect more than 2 pieces of broccoli, one mushroom and a decent amount of zucchini and onion. My chicken dinner cost around $16, and the best part was the Shrimp sauce,    They served my husbands combo with teryaki chicken instead of regular hibachi and when he told them it was wrong twice, our chef pretended not to hear and turned the fan on. We were so annoyed at that point, we didn't push the issue...paid our $50 tab and bolted.   Won't be returning. Given this place too many opportunities and they constantly fail."}
{"text":"Recent update:- I recently visited this restaurant again, I noticed a strange thing.. I guess staff who allocates your table based on races. This can be working well for the smooth delivery of service, but being a regular here I noticed this clearly and felt little blue.  Food is tasty. Well sautéed and great for your asian tastebuds. I loved the artistic way of sautéing the veggies and all shrimp and chicken.  Our chef was funny he cut the veggies and chicken by his sharpie knife so smoothly; it's charming absolutely amazing to watch.  The only thing I felt that I wish the food was little less oily."}
{"text":"Absolutely top scores in my book! This place is always very inviting the smell of the food the aroma that hit you when you walk in the door is mouthwatering. The sushi is outstanding and the service is always perfect. I've eaten there so many times I cannot count, but I have never had a bad experience in over 20 years of  eating at this restaurant. This is absolutely one of my favorite places because I know how careful they are with their food preparation and the fact that the place is spotless, and exceptionally good service. By the way I always check the bathrooms before I actually sit down to eat in a place, and their bathrooms would get an A rating from me."}
{"text":"First time guests, we missed our old Japanese steakhouse back home.  We were not disappointed.  We sat at the hibachi and our chef did an awesome job.  The soup was fantastic, rich and so flavorful.  My husband had steak and scallops, he said it was delicious.  I had the filet steak and shrimp.  The filet was cooked perfectly and was as tender as any steak I've had at a high end steakhouse.  I don't know what they do with their noodles...but they were the best I've ever had.  There was a bit of a wait to be seated, as was expected for a Saturday night and without a reservation.  We enjoyed a glass of wine at the bar and the wait was definitely worth it.  Can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since 98' and it's been consistently excellent since then! This is the finest hibachi style restaurant in Charlotte."}
{"text":"So this review is based on solely the sushi FYI. I wanted to branch out and try sushi somewhere other than my normal spot and randomly picked here. My husband and I shared the Hope, Volcano, 49er and caterpillar rolls and they were all so fresh and flavorful. The sushi chef Chris was super friendly and definitely an added bonus to talk to while at the bar. We will be back for sushi for sure and probably try the hibachi at some point."}
{"text":"Average food. You can tell they use cheap steak and lobster. The sauces are not good and they are constantly rushing you. I literally had my soup and salad delivered within 30 seconds of each other. Then the chef comes out to rush us. The server is stuck constantly refilling tiny glasses and trying to rush us so we have room for hot food from the chef. The chef was entertaining but the food wasn't very good. Large portions of noodles and vegetables. I guess they want big portions to make up for poor quality. Doesn't work. Then the server comes out to rush us into boxing up our food. The very minute the chef is done! How about we get some time to eat and talk?!? Boxes were left at the table while we were still eating so that The server could return to constantly filling tiny glasses. We wanted to make sure the chef got tipped out, but came to find he splits them with the server... even. That is just wrong. The servers are running around hustling people through dinner so they can get the next table in.    The place cuts too many corners and rushes you through dinner. It's not very good. And they take advantage of the wait staff. Did I mention the hostesses were rude? Find somewhere better to eat."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Too expensive for what you get. They were just going through the motions without any emotion. Food had no flavor. A lot of veggies very little steak or chicken. My son and I ordered different chicken but both orders were prepared the same. Had to ask for more water. Still eating when take home boxes were brought out. I felt like I had wasted my hard earned money."}
{"text":"Visited here after having a not-so-good experience elsewhere and I was glad that I did. Our server was nice and the cook made sure our orders were correct and had the server bring more shrimp as soon as he realized that there was small mix-up.   Also, if you're a fan of sake and/or have never tried and don't want to break the bank, they offer $4 Gekkeikan served warm/cold. As with any hibachi, the price per plate is going to be around the $20 range but it's well worth it, considering how much food you receive.   The only drawback, the closeness of the table to the grill and all the smoke (if sitting right in front of the chef) will have your clothes smelling like food afterwards. But being the fat kid that I am... I take it (lol)!   Definitely coming back!"}
