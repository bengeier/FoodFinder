{"text":"Great place to eat Italian. Very authentic dishes.  Excellent wait staff. Price is very good for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"Pizza was good.  Not bad.  Other pasta items are excellent! Surprisingly good for an Italians place in a strip mall."}
{"text":"New Yorker..... this place even smells right! I have never been disappointed! So happy to find my comfort food!"}
{"text":"Food is outstanding and the staff is always helpful and friendly.  This is what a good restaurant looks like!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  I'm not Italian but I venture to say it's authentic. Homemade sauce! Homemade bread!  What more could you ask for. I have never been disappointed with any menu item. Love, love, love this place!"}
{"text":"Been here on multiple occasions with friends and family. The food is excellent, and most of the staff is usually on top of things. It's usually pretty quiet, so it's a nice little gem in the area. It normally seems a little short staffed, so be prepared for a longer wait than usual."}
{"text":"Not sure why it took me so long to write a review for this place, because I am here all the time.  It is quick, close to home and tasty.  It does remind me of pizza joints that you would find in NY, grease and all.  So far I have tried their cheese pizza, ziti and lasagna and everything has been really good, satisfying, very reasonably priced and consistent.  Consistency is a big deal for me, when I go to Capriccio's I know what to expect every time.  The owner is very friendly and he really puts the effort into making sure you are happy with your visit.  Way to go Capriccio's!!  Keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"Love this place, authentic pizza- great salads & pasta. Friendly staff - so glad to have this place."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here on the rare occasion. Their pizza is fair. If you like super greasy, razor thin slices with more of an \"orange sauce,\" than a good hearty red sauce.  They used to have the small added touch of cloth napkins that has now been reduced to paper napkins and less than satisfying service. During this particular dining experience, my boyfriend and I sat with empty glasses that were finally refilled as we were finishing our meal. We then sat for an inappropriate amount of time waiting to ask our waitress for a box and our check to which we were then asked to \"give her a second.\" From that point on, all charm and eye contact was no longer offered.   I think I'll settle for oven pizza at home next time, because it seems like this place has jumped the shark."}
{"text":"Huge pizza fan here, and let me say I will eat just about any pizza out there. Unfortunately I was very disappointed. The owner is very nice service was great. Over all a nice place, but if your looking for some great pizza I would not recommend."}
{"text":"If you want a bread pizza with few toppings, this is the place to go.  It feels authentic in many ways, but there are much better Italian restaurants in Charlotte."}
{"text":"By far the BEST pizza in Charlotte...but it doesn't stop there. The owner and staff are so warm and friendly. You always feel welcomed and special! The grilled chicken salad is wonderful, the pasta dishes are great, you will be very pleased whatever your meal selection. I love Cappricios!!!"}
{"text":"Best Italian in Charlotte! Pizza is yummy & pasta sauce is the best. True authentic Italian!"}
{"text":"I go out of my way to eat here. Great pizza and family atmosphere with enough variety to make multiple visits seem fresh."}
{"text":"Good food and service. Restaurant is on the small side so best bet is take out. Pizza is usually good but can be spotty,I guess it depends on what cook is working but always better than the big chains."}
{"text":"I eat here about once a week now. The value you get for your dollar is great as the portions are pretty large, and it is pretty cheap for Italian. Entrees come with soup or salad, I always get soup and Ive had like 3 or 4 different soups and not a single one has disappointed. Ive had multiple entrees, all but one were very good, the one I didnt care for lacked flavor and I believe it was because they were busy and I let it slide. Only had a plain slice one time and that was probably the best you will find in the area, very solid pizza (I was born and raised in NY). Overall a great spot for a relatively inexpensive, relaxing night out with the old lady or the whole family. Solid italian food."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and quick and easy take out. We got a Sicilian pie to go and it was delicious! You can taste the fresh basil in the sauce. Very close to NY style and flavor! We will be back for more!!"}
{"text":"Delivers on what it intends to be. Good food in an easy, relaxed atmosphere. The complimentary bread is so delicious. Haven't yet had the pizza but the veal parmigiano, chicken marsala, and ravioli dishes are quite good. Great place to drop in for lunch or dinner. Have found service to be quick and efficient."}
{"text":"I haven't been in Charlotte very long...only two months and I must say it's truly culinary HELL! I didn't realize it was so hard to find any good food around here. I've eaten at the best of the best restaurants in most major U.S. cities so I know good food. With that said, this establishment is a really good place to nosh. The food is fresh and tastes a lot like real Italian food. While, I haven't tried their pizza, I do know that their calzones are delicious. They use 2 different types of cheeses and their dough is amazing. Fried cheese is also amazing! I've tried 3 pasta dishes and all were piping hot, fresh and delicious. Their pizza is next on my list as it's been REALLY difficult to find any really good pizza here. I found one place that has NY style pizza that's pretty good...Hawthorne's. I strongly disagree with any bad reviews this place has received. Maybe it's gotten better since their reviews, I don't know. I've always had good service here as well. For me to write  a positive review really means something. Also, keep in mind, everyone's taste buds are different but I don't think you will be disappointed!"}
{"text":"First time here and very impressed! The dining room has a very Italian ambiance with a map of Italy and old school blk&wht pictures on the wall and high quality tables and chairs. The sweet tea was really really good and we had the eggplant parm, stuffed peppers and NY pizza. Everything was awesome! The bathrooms could use some work and the salad was ok but will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Very good philly cheesesteaks, they come in a big box with lots of fries. The pizza are really good as well loaded with toppings of your choice. Prices are pretty reasonable. You can sit inside or order out and they staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Very good, quality food every time. Owner is really nice and his employees seem happy to work there."}
{"text":"Anthony the owner is from Naples , Italy.  He is a great cook and an even better person.  YOU MUST TRY THIS PLACE.  NY NJ people in NC this is back home stuff.  In many ways a tad better.  This guy takes NO SHORT CUTS when he cooks.  All of the food is good.  I specifically love the veal and their pizza is very , very good.  The service is excellent.  The place is spotless.   SECRET-  If their is something on the menu that you do not see, or you want something made special, tell him and he will make it for you.  ie-  Broccholi Robb and sausage.  Madone, can he cook."}
{"text":"NY-style pizza is my favorite and Capriccio's is the best I've found in metro Charlotte. Very good NY style pizza, very good price, and they even make good, strong iced tea. I've driven 20 minutes out of my way just for their pizza.  If you like NY-style, go!"}
{"text":"Love love love Capriccios! My family and I have been coming here since 2007 and the pizza/pasta is always good. Every time we visit we feel like family and I will never eat pizza any where else."}
{"text":"Really good cheese pizza. Tried the pizza, the cheese was very good, the sauce was sweet and tasted great with the cheese. Having tried lots of pizza places recently I can say that Capriccio is very good, I would say their prices for a whole pizza are a bit high and that can be improved on but a solid choice. Another place that tastes like capriccios is Da Vinci's so I suggest trying them if needing any new pizza places."}
{"text":"Ok i have lived in charlotte for 13 years and this place has always hit the spot, authentic italian food with great people and great family style atmosphere. Shrimp fra diablo is good and any type of pizza. Def a good italian spot"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch. Great place if your craving pizza and wings. Sweet tea is tasty, waitress (Nikki) was very polite. Try this place out if your in the area!"}
{"text":"Tried this place on vacation again, & changed my review to disappointed and not worth the wait.    They burnt the first cheese pizza. After a long wait, the second wasn't like I remembered. I only ate it because I was soo hungry.    The time before I had an amazing pizza and penne ala vodka.  Can't say I'd recommend it after my last experience!"}
{"text":"Had a little bit of everything Charlotte has to offer during my stay, as far as the food goes. When it came to looking for something Italian, this was the place. And it will be another time too. Good menu, good service, good portions and good prices. As far as I recall everything was under $20 and that was one of the selling points, besides the positive reviews. And they don't lie. I forgot the waitress's name but she was also very helpful. So if you're not sure where to go, try here."}
{"text":"Fooood is soooo yummy!!  Ive been going for years and they never disappoint! When im  not on my next health gig and want something cheesy and carb-y im always down for this place. Very authentic feel too!!"}
{"text":"We got take out from here after moving into a neighborhood nearby and were so happy to find such a great Italian spot so close to the new house!  The pizza was fabulous, their house dressing was great and the service was friendly.  We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This place is reliable goodness. We have been coming here for years and never tire of the food or wonderful staff. If you are ever even near this place and desire great Italian this is it."}
{"text":"There are only two pizza places I'll eat at and this is number one for me. I get a large Pepperoni pizza every weekend. The owner and staff are super nice even the cooks are nice to me! New York style pizza and super fresh. I know it's strange but they have a great Philly cheese steak too. When my meat eating friends are in town we go for a large all meat pizza and that is also great. I can't speak on the other Italian dishes but the pizzas out of this world. Locally owned and operated you can't beat it."}
{"text":"Save ur money or go somewhere else. Sauce was bland & watery. Had one slice of my pizza & threw it away. Same for the lasanga."}
{"text":"I am from NJ and I know good pizza.  This place has good NYC style pizza.  I can't believe the bad reviews it has gotten.  Before you make any judgments just swing by and have a slice.  If you know good pizza, you will like this place."}
{"text":"We have only tried the take out. Their pizza is addicting! We love the crust and sauce especially. They are always fast and the order is ready on time."}
{"text":"The absolute best NY style pizza un Charlotte. The two men who own Capriccios are Italian and lovely! We typically get their large cheese pizza (good pizza doesn't need toppings in my opinion) or the Stromboli. Either are enough to feed a small army and are excellent."}
{"text":"One of the better pizza joints in the Charlotte area. Thin and saucy with great toppings and generous cheese. It's more NY style than most places nearby - it's a solid choice!"}
{"text":"Excellent italiyan! (Southern way) love their food, chicken Parm is great, balsamic dressing is food, although wish they also had a homemade house Italian dressing. Lunch specials are great, come here usually at least once a week"}
{"text":"Stromboli  HEAVEN. Havnt had one that good since I left New York. Great calamari, seafood and eggplant dishes as well. Good cheesecake as well! Portion sizes are perfect to fill you up, except for the tormented stromboli. A large can feed a family of four."}
{"text":"Started with pizza to go but always wanted to try an entree. Tonight I had the opportunity and wasn't disappointed. Pizza is advertised as New York style but this is better than any such style that I've had. Plenty of sauce, generous gourmet toppings and a delicious crust. The dine in experience was equally enjoyable. We were promptly seated and the service was exceptional throughout the evening. Soup was an Italian chicken noodle that came with complimentary bread. Both were excellent. Cheese ravioli and spaghetti with meat sauce did not disappoint but I would recommend the shrimp scampi. The even have a full kids menu for the little ones. My only suggestion would be to offer a beer on draft or two. You can't really go wrong with Capriccio."}
{"text":"I eat at this place at least 2-4 times a month and usually get the pizza with chicken and meatballs (beef), Always fantastic.  I'm a New Yorker, so I know good pizza and Capriccio has the BEST pizza.  I've tried other dishes (Chicken Marsala, Arrabiata, Lasagna) and they're ok.  I will say the pizza is fantastic and they sell it by the slice (like home).  I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This has ended up being out go-to place for take out or dine in Italian.  Wait staff is awesome, bread and salads don't hurt my feelings and the courses are huge and well seasoned.  My initial concerns have been put to rest.  Thank you Capriccio's"}
{"text":"We love this place. Pasta is always good. Portions are decent. A little expensive but it's worth it to me. I love the lasagna and the chicken pastini soup. They give you a real bowl of soup, not some small cup. I have yet to try anything that I haven't like. I have not tried the pizza but it looks delicious. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I can't speak to the pizza (which seems to get mixed reviews here), but I had the caprese salad and mozzarella sticks appetizer with their bread (which was both complimentary and complementary) and left with a smile on my face.  Which is saying something because I only stumbled across this place since it was within walking distance of the repair shop where my car had to be towed.  I most definitely wasn't smiling when I went it.   There's nothing complicated about what I ordered, so some people might discount that as easy to get right; however, I disagree. I've been to a lot of restaurants that can't get the simple stuff right and this one definitely did.  Creamy buffalo mozzarella fried to perfection without being greasy and homemade ranch that was satisfyingly thick enough to have the true lusciousness a good ranch dressing should. Then perfectly sliced, wonderfully fresh roma tomatoes layered with thick slices of buffalo mozz (no skimping here!) and obviously fresh herbs with a bit of olive oil served with a carafe of balsamic so you can drizzle till your heart's content.  Warm, crusty bread served with creamy butter that arrives at the table at room temperature for ready-to-spread goodness that's hard to beat.    The service was average (not exceptional, but not worthy of ridicule.) The food, on the other hand, was fresh, flavorful, and simply spectacular."}
{"text":"Simply awesome ...A quaint little restaurant with great food and service! Much better than Carrabas Italian Restaurant!"}
{"text":"Such great pizza which keeps us going back. We have only ordered carry out so we can't speak for the waitstaff but EVERY time we order and take out, the counter staff there seem pissed off and so not welcoming. It says a lot about Their pizza that we go back because I can't stand the employees' attitudes. It's similar to Seinfeld's Soup Nazi... only not funny."}
{"text":"Very authentic food. Friendly staff and never had any issues. We eat here frequently or get it to go as well. For non-chain italian food this is our GO-TO!"}
{"text":"Hostess started our experience with \"sorry I'm not good at this seating people\". We were ready to order food when she asked about drinks but the waitress/hostess left immediately after our drink orders. Salad dressing came in a lidded to-go container on the side of the dish. Pasta serving was decent but not large, and absolutely swimming in Alfredo sauce. I didn't want to finish the pasta because of the amount of sauce (about a cup more than necessary)."}
{"text":"I don't branch out and try various menu items here because I am obsessed with their lasagna and salad with house dressing! The service is always friendly and personable. And those cannoli... heavenly! A true gem of a restaurant!"}
{"text":"Best Eggplant Parm, pizza and meatballs around ! Service is very friendly and great. We eat here once a week !"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I got the pizza to take home, so if I come back and it's really good again, I'd have no problem giving the 5th star.  I grabbed Carpiccio to go on my way from UNCC home based off of the great reviews. I got a cheese pizza, and the gentlemen said it would be about 15 minutes, so I went next door to Harris Teeter to grab some things. When I came back, the pizza was hot and ready. It wasn't terribly expensive at around $12.  It was really good. Up there with the best in Charlotte. I think Capriccio sits at #2 behind Due Amici's and ahead of Brooklyn Pizza for the best, although the service at Capriccio is better than both of them. The pizza had a great cheese to sauce to bread ratio--nothing was overpowering. A lot of places like to overdo the cheese, but not here. The pizza wasn't terribly greasy, either which is always appreciated.  I'd stop by again and eat there to see how it is, but for now, great pizza, good service. I'd give it a shot for lunch if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Delicious and affordable. The stromboli was awesome  (I had one with spinach, garlic and mushrooms). Although we were visiting Charlotte, we would definitely try them again."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with the husband. I had heard it was really good and being from NY am always on a search for authentic Italian. I loved the atmosphere and that place does a mean business! The line was out the door for pickup. I went with the Chicken Passion, which was delicious! Chicken and bowtie pasta with broccoli in mushrooms in a marinara sauce. The sauce was spot on and everything was seasoned to perfection. My husband had lasagna which he and I both thought was subpar. Definitely not bad or made poorly just the way they make their lasagna we didnt like. We prefer a thicker lasagna. This didn't have a ton of meat or sauce on it. I am definitely going again to try the pizza and I will update my review. Their pie looked amazing!"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal here. The pizza is awesome!! The dishes are always made after ordering and arrive hot! Their bread is even great!"}
{"text":"How have I never written a review for this little gem in Harrisburg?!  We visit Capriccios at least once a month.  It's a small authentic Italian restaurant with owners straight from Italy.  Their food is ALL very good!  I have tried a variety of items from pizza to pasta to salads to strombolis- and it never disappoints!    My favorites- their house balsamic dressing-  AMAZING- I have actually just ordered salads to go in order to have this dressing!  Their bread!  They bake it as you need it- it's doughy fresh and hot!  The butter melts on it and we always eat more than we should.  My husband gets grilled chicken salads and they are huge and delicious!  Especially the Caesar.  Everything is homemade here, and fresh!    We are lacking restaurants in Harrisburg!  If you in the mood for Italian and are on the fence try it- knocks Dino's and Hawthorne's out of the park food wise!  It's a bit more quaint- but service is good- or take to go.  Small beer and wine menu, and some amazing looking homemade tiramisu too!"}
{"text":"This place is the best. Quick service, delicious food, and friendly staff. I have been a customer since the day I moved into the neighborhood and I still can't get enough. I love the authenticity of the preparation and the laid back vibe in the place. I have absolutely no complaints. This is consistent NY style goodness! Perfect for the family or a casual date night."}
{"text":"I ordered the baked ziti and my husband ordered the sorrento. As soon as we were home,  we were both sick. Our kids had the pizza and they were fine. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Love the cheese slices!! Taste just like NY! Food is fresh and quick, the salads are to die for and don't forget house dressing.."}
{"text":"Best authentic food in Charlotte. We eat them 1-2 times a week. From the pizza, to the gnocchi and even the wings, you won't find any better."}
{"text":"Great pizza and great service. There other food is really good as well.  If you like a thin crust pizza like I do, this is the place to get it from."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for those living in the Rocky River/Bradfield Farms area! It's a nice family Italian spot that a lot of people don't know about. They have good lunch specials, great fresh bread, and their chicken Alfredo is amazing!!! They also have good pizza with huge slices!!! Great for the family to bring home for dinner."}
{"text":"Walked in with my fiancé 30ish minutes before closing, and no one seemed irritated that we had come so close to closing!  (We haven't had the best of luck with they lately...)  We sat right down as the restaurant was nearly empty.  We ordered an appetizer - stuffed mushrooms.  They were good, but probably not something I will order a second time.   Our food came out promptly.  Our meals came with choice of soup or salad, which can be hard to find these days!  My chicken Parmesan was AMAZING and I cannot wait to go back for more!  This classic dish was prepared perfectly and pleased my taste buds!  Definitely recommend this place to others!"}
{"text":"New York transplants are always on a mission to find great pizza in Charlotte. A friend (and fellow New Yorker) told us to check out this place for the great pizza, we were pleasantly surprised!  The restaurant was crowded (a good sign) and smelled like a NY Pizzeria (an even better sign)!  The garlic knots were great and so was our half mushroom pie, thin crust with quality sauce and cheese!!. Our server Rosie was very friendly and attentive. Wish we knew about this place years ago!! We will be back!"}
{"text":"If you are from anywhere north of Maryland, you no doubt miss pizza. As an Italian kid from Philly, I end up cooking all my own food, because I'll be dam ned if I'm eating some Olive Garden nonsense.  The we discovered Capriccios.   Since I was in college, we'd drive over to the south Harrisburg area when we had a few extra bucks to spend to get the real deal slice. Now, I live closer by and have the privilege to eat here whenever I want, and nothing could make me happier.  The food is amazing, the gnocchi, the meats, everything. Thank you Capriccios, you make it taste like home!"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful hidden gem from most of town, yet they have Italian perfected. From the lasagna to the muscles to of course the Pizza. They have a great antipasto salad with pickled veggies, and lastly the fresh baked bread paired with the marinara sauce...ooooweeee!"}
{"text":"First time to the restaurant. Service was good. Ambiance was poor - chair rails and walls all scuffed up, and the place could use some kind of ceiling divider to keep the bright white kitchen lights out of dining area.   But we were there for the food. The soup was pasta fagioli -  a cream base rather than tomato and it tasted more like a bean soup. It was good. Ordered the chicken special and a pizza to share.  Chicken dish had two chicken breasts covered with prosciutto and smokey mozarella, with pasta and sauce. A bit salty but the chicken and pasta was cooked perfectly. It was a huge serving - more than enough to share and take extras home. The pizza was cheese, sausage, onion and pepperoni. Again, good sauce and flavors, but it was quite greasy. Will definitely go back,but will probably ask for a table near the front windows."}
{"text":"Went there on a Friday night to dine in.  Be aware they do an INCREDIBLE carryout business, especially on Friday nights. So the incredibly long line that you will be waiting in is for carry out pizza, not to be seated. We did call ahead and they reserved a table for us which was very nice on a Friday night. Food was great our server was great, and it's a cool place. We will definitely go back again. And even though we didn't order pizza, our server was so nice she brought us a slice so that we could try it and it was amazing. Strongly recommend this place."}
{"text":"My family loves this place. Their house balsamic dressing and homemade bread are worth the trip alone. Try the eggplant rollatini if you enjoy eggplant. The only thing is I don't care for their meat sauce."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Harrisburg, hands down! Pasta dishes are fantastic as well - everything on the menu is good, and the staff is quick and very friendly."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with a friend while in the area. I got the capriccio with penne. It's a cream presto sauce and has chicken. Wow! I could have licked the plate clean. I did use bread when the pasta and chicken were gone. My friend got veal marsala. He really liked his as well and cleaned his plate. It's a small place tucked away by the harris teeter, but do yourself a favor and seek this place out. I wish they were closer to where I live. Lunch was $19 after tax before tip. We just drank water."}
{"text":"Have not had a bad meal there yet. The Portions are great and the prices are not too bad. It is truly authentic just like my Italian Grandmother!"}
{"text":"Reasonable place to stop in for a pizza (or other Italian) dish, but as has been mentioned elsewhere, not a whole bunch better than what you can find anywhere else, notably including your own kitchen - and often for much cheaper.  The nice thing is that they aren't a long ways from our house, which makes it nice, and let's face it - just about anything that you can get from a restaurant can be made at home for cheaper, and that's not the reason we eat out. It's juts easier.  In this case, the service is good, and generally quick. It's just one of those places that leaves you without much memorable in the end. That is good in that it's not a bad feeling, but it isn't a place you want to return to either, so that can't be a great thing either!"}
{"text":"A nice, small Italian restaurant in the Brookdale Plaza on Rocky River off I-485, it has great Veal Parmigiana and all kinds of pizzas.  It's a very inexpensive getaway and Frank Sinatra lovers will definitely frequent the place because his songs are constantly being played. Ask for Holly to be your waitress."}
{"text":"Excellent food!!!!!! We had chicken parm and it was one of the best we have had in Charlotte!  They also had great home made salad dressing! Great little Italian place, great value too!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town, traditional ny style and they also have sicilan which is my favorite"}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved up to this area!! Since moving to NC we have not found a real deal Italian restaurant! We gave this place a try, ordered for take out, and we were beyond impressed! We come from the North and my husband is full Italian so it's hard to find great Italian! I think we found it! We will eat in next time!!"}
{"text":"This was a great, authentic Italian place. Small, family owned place. I had the soup and salad and others had pizza and loved it. Great service, great value!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Charlotte area. Made by a meticulous Italian guy who rolls out 1 pie at a time. We are from NY and have not found anything else comparable."}
{"text":"Really good Tortellini Special (tortellini with shrimp & broccoli in alfredo sauce. My husband had stromboli & they subbed bacon for mushrooms with no issues. My daughter got the kids' spaghetti & meatballs. Portions were very large & we had leftovers to take home. So yummy & waitress was very friendly & attentive. The Riesling was delicious!"}
{"text":"I have enjoyed everything I've eaten here.  Sometimes the service is a bit slow but over all it's a good place in the Harrisburg area for your pizza and Italian food."}
{"text":"Cute place! The food was very good & the service was AMAZING! Super friendly & fast! And very reasonably priced (lunch)...Wish we lived closer, but we'll definitely stop when we come up this way!"}
{"text":"I guess i went on an off day. The pepperoni pizza was salty, greasy, and rubbery. Mediocre at best..."}
{"text":"We always have excellent food and service here, the grilled chicken salad is really tasty and so is the Italian sausage sandwich"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to give this little Italian restaurant a try. We have come across some real authentic Italian treasures this way, however this was NOT one. We had soup and salad which was ok and each ordered their Stromboli ... It comes with mushroom, sausage, and pepperoni. My husband asked to hold the mushrooms. The sauce was poor quality canned marinara. The dough was still raw in the center through out the Stromboli. Mine, which had mushrooms, was 50% stuffed with cheap canned mushrooms.  We ate what we could from opening it and eating around the raw dough. When we brought it to the waiters attention he explained that all restaurants get the same complaint  The \"Owners\" never offered to come speak with us and made it clear that they could care less about the low quality and undercooked food. We paid 29.49 and tipped the waiter his appropriate 15% ( we normally tip at least 30%).... Don't waist your money!!!! There are plenty of really good restaurants that deserve and appreciate your business... This is not one!!!!If I could rate it zero stars, I would!!!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner here! I don't care for the thin ny-style, so we ordered a sicilian. Delicious! Price was great - 4 beers between us and the ginormous sicilian ran about $35, and easily fed 2 adults, a toddler, and a teen, with leftovers to spare. Not greasy at all and the thing was HUGE. Crust was yummy and crunchy. Cheese was great, not rubbery in the slightest. I guess the only thing that would have made the pizza better would be if there was a tiny bit more sauce, or if it came with a side of sauce to dip the crust in. But that's just my opinion, still freaking good either way. The restaurant and restrooms were very clean - you notice these things with a toddler in and out of bathrooms. Service was great, the gentleman serving us was super courteous. Cant wait to go back! Man oh man can't wait to heat up my leftovers! YUM!!! Oh. And for those that care - there were cloth napkins."}
{"text":"Just loved the homemade bread, lentil soup, stuffed mushrooms and pizza. Relaxed atmosphere. Friendly waiters. Family oriented. What's not to like?"}
{"text":"I stopped eating out at basic Italian places because... Heck I can fix most of these items better than they do!  This place is no exception.  I only come here because my \"special\" somebody (as in he is really special when it comes to his taste bud or the lack thereof) truly thinks this place has the best pizza. My dear yelper friends, read my lips, they do NOT have the best pizza.  Nothing here is memorable. To be fair, their food are edible and especially if you are hungry and you are stuck out that way (hence 2 stars)   Truth is their marinara sauce was tart. I had to work on it at the table in order for it to not taste like it came from a can. Meatballs were blend and a little tough. Pizza looked under-cooked.  Service was never great. I really think it is a waste of a restaurant because they obviously have a core support group in order for it to be still in business. So either all their regulars do not know what real and good Italian food taste like or... Sadly I can't think of another reason."}
{"text":"The pizza is fiend, cheese for $11.25, the ranch the the goat, I'm 290 and get full off 4 pieces. It's huge. And the waiter, the goat."}
{"text":"You know when you bite into a good quality flavorful tasting slice of pizza... this was not one of them."}
{"text":"This place is a great mix of elegant Italian dining and neighborhood pizza joint. Everything from the pizza to the calamari is tasty. A nice house sauce and a great environment."}
{"text":"wait staff was very polite, and the food delicious and home made . The bathroom was also very clean."}
