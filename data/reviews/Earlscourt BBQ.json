{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night around 11:00pm with a group of friends to enjoy some drinks. I asked the female waitress for a cup of hot water & she told me that EarlyCourt does not have hot water.....???? I then asked a male staff for some hot water and he cheerfully told me that it will be coming right up. Some time passed and the female waitress, who initially refused to me said it will be ready in about 15-20 min. (the same amount of time it would take for a MEAL). I eventually got what I asked for... The male waiter handed me the water and asked what I was planning on doing with it. I politely told him that I was going drink it. When I was about to sip it I noticed there were BLACK PARTICLES FLOATING IN THE WATER. I am assuming that this was done on purpose.   The two staff members who served us did not appear to be in the right state if mind,  and their demeanour was VERY odd. -Will gladly never return."}
{"text":"Yeah...no. A decent selection of beer can't make up for very clumsy service and food that is over-priced and not well-prepared. We decided to throw caution to the wind after reading the mixed reviews, but have landed firmly in the 'once-was-enough' camp. To echo some of the other comments...brisket was dry and chewy, ribs were way over-seasoned. Overall a very disappointing experience. If bbq is all you do, it should be kick-ass. This was just a kick in the ass."}
{"text":"Love love love this place!  The brisket was outstanding, didn't even want to put sauce on it.  The beef and pork ribs are perfectly cooked and the chicken wings are Super crispy.  Ya gotta try the sauces, they are all very good but the spicy was my fav.  Had the brownie dessert; deep moist chocolate brownie with whipped cream and candies bacon.  Yummmmmmm! Want to give a special thanks to Sandine, she is a great waitress!  She is personable, funny, knows the menu & has great recommendations.  She made our meal just fabulous!!"}
{"text":"We live around the corner and watched anxiously as ECBBQ set up shop. We REALLY love BBQ, and we REALLY wanted it to be good. I'm here to tell you that it FAR exceeding our expectations. Literally everything I've had has been incredible (brisket and fried chicken being the faves). Service is excellent and its super child friendly. The beer selection is excellent and they have decent wine. We love!!"}
{"text":"I was a big fan of Earlscourt BBQ at their previous location so I was super excited to visit to their new location at 1278 St Clair. The food was as epic as usual and the owner and staff were super friendly and courteous. I'm definitely looking forward to my next visit to Earlscourt."}
{"text":"Got a platter to go, and was pretty disappointed, especially given the positive reviews from yelp and Blogto.  I have definitely had good takeout BBQ on multiple occasions, so I know it can be done, but this one missed the mark.  Meat overall had very little flavour to it, and both sides (mac&cheese and collards) were nothing to write home about.  If you want a plate of meat to go with your beer (quite an extensive selection, btw), then this might be okay.  Would not recommend if you are just going for the food."}
{"text":"This is the real deal. Real southern bbq. Slow and low. So tender an flavorful. I had the meat tornado. Perfect."}
{"text":"Brisket was tasty but chewy. Beer selection was great. Lots of space in there - nice change from Stockyard's cramped feel. Fries arrived cold. Server forgot our beer. Couldn't taste the cheese in the mac and cheese - mostly just butter."}
{"text":"I have eaten a lot of BBQ in my day; and after one visit, this place ranks among my all time favourite BBQ establishments. I admit that I wasn't blown away by the wings (shared my opinion with the owner) but everything else was superlative (pulled pork, brisket, pork belly (seasonal), pork ribs and beef ribs). The sides were also bang on: loved the stewed peach chucks in the baked beans; coleslaw was very fresh. The house-made side sauces were excellent. Even the biscuits were memorable--achieving the perfect balance of bready-, buttery- and salty-ness. Service was great. The owner strikes me as someone who is truly passionate about his craft. I will go again... and again!"}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews but this place is so good I want to tell everyone. When you first go in your nose goes into overdrive it smells so good. The food does not disappoint. I had the fried chicken and it was amazing. Really something special. The decor is very informal and the staff are super friendly."}
{"text":"My review is based on opening night, so I'm willing to accept that future experiences may vary. I was a big fan of Pork Ninjas at their previous location and swear by their food still.  I arrived at the restaurant a few minutes after 7 p.m. on opening night with my girlfriend and immediately noticed that it is a very loud interior. We suspected it might be because it's a lower-level location, but maybe it's just that the groups there were feeling particularly rowdy on opening night.   There didn't seem to be a structure for seating or ordering, so we went to the bar at first and asked what to do. We were told to grab a table, so we did, and pointed out where we'd be to the staff.   While at the table, we waited for just shy of 30 minutes for someone to pay attention to us. I don't mean that we meekly sat in a corner and waited; I mean that we made efforts to sign and otherwise get servers' attention but were constantly ignored. We wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt on opening night, but when a server finally did come, they acknowledged that they'd seen us waiting but were too busy to acknowledge us personally. Even just letting us know that they'd be a few more minutes would have helped us feel less actively ignored.   We were truthfully about 2 minutes away from our decided deadline for just packing it up and calling it. The promise of Pork Ninjas' food was the only thing that kept us in our chairs and made us order something when they rolled around.   We placed our order at just around 7:30 p.m. I ordered the beef brisket sandwich, she the fried chicken sandwich - our usual standbys at the old location.  Their beer selection is very good, as has been stated before, so we weren't disappointed. The beer even arrived fairly quickly, in about 3 or 4 minutes, so we thought things were on the rise.  We eventually got our food at just about 8:30 p.m. In that entire intervening time, there was no indication as to how long the food would take. We remember it being almost surprisingly quick at the old location. Again, maybe a growing pain from opening night.   But in that same intervening time no one checked in with us at all. We made our drinks last the hour since no one came to check if we wanted any more.   When the food did come, we hadn't been given cutlery yet, and there was the promise of some being brought over. I made my way through my whole sandwich before I ended up just walking to the bar again and asking for some to be brought - again. That time it did come a few minutes later.  Mercifully, the food *tasted* great and just how we remembered it at the old location. The one exception to this was that my girlfriend was very surprised to find a large number of bones in her fried chicken sandwich. We'd been to their previous location many times, so the addition of bones to the sandwich was an odd new addition, and definitely a surprise to find when you bite into a sandwich. She pulled out about half a dozen bones over the course of her meal. We wondered if maybe they had run out of thighs/breasts and had started using wings in the sandwiches at some point.  We were out of the restaurant just before 9 p.m., but I don't think we'll be back for a while because I don't want to have to budget 2 hours of time to eat a sandwich.   At the time I didn't see any signage for delivery or call-ahead/pickup, but if that sort of service becomes available, I admit I won't be able to resist taking advantage of it in future - with the exception of that chicken sandwich. But we likely won't be eating in until we hear that things are running smoother; we just didn't feel overly welcome in there."}
{"text":"The beer list was extensive and satisfied what I was looking for. We ordered the platter so we could try all the meats. Pulled pork, roast beef, chicken wings and ribs were all excellent. When I go back again, I'll order the wings and ribs combo."}
{"text":"Okay so this is based on opening day, so it may not be very accurate to the experience moving forward but DAMMIT I WANT THAT FTR. Stay tuned for an update.  The Hubster and I came here late on opening day to find that they had run out of most everything (not unusual for a BBQ place), but still had plenty of beer! The beer selection is good, something we are dearly missing in this neighbourhood. The only items they had left were the wings and the beef brisket, plus some sides. We ordered a beef brisket sandwich, fries and wings. All were delicious. The beef brisket was soft and fatty, and the plain bun was the perfect carrier for it. The wings were a bit small but perfectly cooked, tasty and crunchy as hell. There was ketchup, mustard, bbq sauce and hot sauce on the table. The hot sauce was actually spicy and the bbq sauce was sweet and tasty.  The only complaint I might have is that as soon as the food was dropped, the staff seemed to forget about us and we sat with empty beer glasses (the horror!) and dirty plates for quite some time. The place had mostly emptied out by this time so I'm not sure what was up with that.  All in all, it was a good experience. The food was really good and I look forward to trying their other items. The server was super friendly, which brightened my day. This place is a bit pricey (beers around $7, mains in the high teens to low 20s), which may prevent us from coming all the time. I'm truly excited about the new addition to our neighbourhood and will return soon!"}
{"text":"The food is incredible. Make sure to ask about the sauces before you dig in, because if you don't you'll dig in, think you've had an amazing meal then realise how it pales in comparison when someone tells you about the custom sauces. Also great beer selection. Has the best selection of craft beer in the neighborhood, plus a few \"beers for your dad.\""}
{"text":"We went on a team dinner to Pork Ninjas/Earlscourt BBQ when they were at their Bloor location, and we decided to make a visit to their new location for another team dinner tonight. The platters did not disappoint, and we topped it off with a brownie dessert that was delightful. Everyone should eat here. #porkninjadelight #startupteamdinner"}
{"text":"I love Earlscourt BBQ. My favorite is the wings and ribs. Don't get put off by the basement, the food is great as is the beer selection."}
{"text":"We really wanted to like this place but were disappointed, the BBQ is just not good at all.  They try to cover this up by putting way too much dry rub on the meat.  Will not be going back.  Should have listened to the other negative reviews.  Waitress staff are very nice."}
{"text":"Truly some of the best BBQ I've eaten in Toronto. Jason and Andrea are lovely people which makes the dining experience that much better.  We were two hungry dudes who ordered the Pitmaster....well, it won. I couldn't move for several hours afterwards, I was in a full meat coma.  The rub on the ribs was delicious, I wouldn't change a thing. The pork belly was tender and not too fatty at all. The brisket was full of flavour and just tender enough without completely falling apart. Oh the pulled pork...my favourite of the bunch. Amazing without the mustard sauce, even better with it.  Because we're dumb, we also ordered a half rack of beef ribs and they were fantastic! Be prepared to get down and dirty, they're huge and saucy.  Finally, the beans and cole slaw were great, a perfect pairing for a great meal.  Stop in, have a drink, eat some meat. This is a welcomed addition to the neighborhood and I hope it's here to stay for a long while!  Edit: the meats are all safe for celiacs except the wings which come out of the fryer. Beans and coleslaw good too!"}
{"text":"Great food and beer list. Really enjoyed the brisket and ribs. The kids couldn't get enough of the poutine and chicken wings. After only one visit, I can highly recommend. Great addition to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Wow. That's the best way to describe the experience at Earlscourt BBQ. Lots of space, fun atmosphere, great craft beer selection, and most importantly, the food is INCREDIBLE. Seriously, if you love BBQ, this place knows how to smoke every part of that pig. Brisket was to die for, ribs were some of the best I've had and even the sides were done to perfection. The peach beans are a must try. All in all, I left needing to be rolled out. Try this place."}
{"text":"This isn't just my favorite BBQ place in Toronto, but my favorite BBQ place anywhere.  Jason is a total genius with all things meat.  We live over two hours away and are already trying to figure out when to make the trip next.   -Amazing BBQ -Amazing beer selection -Sunday Brunch -Happy Hour Specials"}
{"text":"I am a Certified BBQ Judge and a pitmaster, I know my BBQ. We met up with some friends from the USA last night  we made up group of 12 people, service was friendly, efficient and my beer was magically filled, so 5/5 for service. Now the Food: Tried the highly recommended Pork and Kimchi Eggrolls - I had to score them a solid 10/5 - The pork belly could have done with crackling, but was soft tender and and perfectly seasoned, and sauced with a nice vinegar sauce, the fried chicken - well what can I say, my better half, does not like fried chicken gave it a resounding 2 thumbs up, I think best fried chicken in Toronto. I woke up this morning and my shirt smelled of smoke, does it get better than that? When in Toronto,  will go back - kudos to the staff - excellent job"}
{"text":"Amazing cocktails. For real. They have some stapples but with a twist (bacon old fashioned). Solid meat. If you want a good BBQ ... This is your placa. Get the Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Easy to miss, but do yourself a favor and find this place. Best BBQ in TO by far with the addition of great cocktails (ask for the bacon old fashioned!)."}
{"text":"Checked this place out on a Thursday evening, big space lots of seating, was greeted by friendly staff.  Seated ourselves, good selection of local beers on tap, and in Tall boys which ranged from$5-$7. Ordered a pulled pork sandwich, wings, ribs and 3sides.  Pulled pork was good, the wings and ribs are dry rubbed and were delicious. The highlight was a side, kimchi spring rolls which were fantastic!  Quick service, good BBQ, local beer.  The only recommendations would be to make the place feel less cavernous, maybe have live music, but other than that a place we'll return to."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I love bbq. Bbq is an art and not everyone is an artist. Sadly, this is the case with Earlscourt.  The ambiance is \"cafeteria\" with a hint of \"basement\" .. the flame walls are overdone (much like the brisket)... the tv playing a loop of a fire is cheesy. The plain white  100 watt light bulbs are too basement feeling.  The food should be awesome considering the hype from blog TO, Not the case, despite the other Yelp reviews we decided to give the platter a shot. Wow what a complete disaster!!!  Terribly dry brisket (even for \"Alberta triple A\") Ribs as you can see by the picture are over coated in some spice rub which is excessively on everything!"}
{"text":"We went to Earlscourt BBQ as we heard that the owner had a long history in BBQ   BOY WERE WE DISAPPOINTED  The Good : A nice looking unpretentious room Perfect for good down to earth BBQ place  A couple of cool craft beers on tap     The Bad !!!   FOOD :  My wife and I ordered the Brisket sandwich  Brisket was very very dry and cold . Absolutely no taste ,never mind zero smoke flavour ,served with a few fries and tasteless mayonnaise soaked coleslaw $16. Each.   Mac and Cheese $12.  A small bowl of Kraft Dinner  like noodles.  Cold and no taste and very dry.  A disgrace for $12    Probably cost them 67c at Walmart  My friends got a single bone beef rib $35. NO SMOKE FLAVOUR EITHER 50% fat and as oily as my car after a fill up at Mr Lube.  Terrible attempt at a braised rib   The owner was bragging about his extensive history in the Bbq circuit and how wonderful he was at smoking meat  Maybe he should go spend some time in the kitchen working on his products and quality and than there would be more than 12 people in his Restaurant on a Saturday night   Please if you are going to say you're selling Southern Style BBQ , use a smoker ,wood ,rub and make sure you're product is decent  Otherwise just stick to a regular BAR AND GRILL"}
