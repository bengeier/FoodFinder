{"text":"Great place!  Tickets include popcorn, pillow and blanket with waiters.  Wow!"}
{"text":"This theatre is the ultimate splurge!  From the comfy recliners complete with blanket and pillow (in the premium seating) to the fantastic wait staff you couldn't ask for a more luxurious way to watch a movie.  Being able to book online and have reserved seats is very convenient.  Yeah, it's expensive (total of $250 for premium seating and dinner for 5-no alcohol involved) but is worth it for a nice evening out with friends once in awhile!"}
{"text":"I will absolutely NEVER go to iPic again!!!

I had been SO excited to go to this theatre with my boyfriend. I had been telling him for 8 months that we had to go to this theatre because I took the tour, knew about it through work, and just loved the whole idea. My boyfriend is a very \"let's do everything last-minute\" type guy, and so it literally took us that much time to finally get into this theatre for a movie. If you want to go, reserve your spot at least a few days in advance. 

Anyway, we finally got in and saw Jack Ryan. The tickets were NOT worth the money to sit in this \"exclusive\" theatre. We decided to make a full date of the experience and also have dinner at the theatre. My boyfriend's food and soda came about 30 minutes before the movie ended (around 9:00pm) and I was not so lucky, my food and water never arrived!!! My boyfriend and I both asked the waiter several times when my food and water would arrive, when we could find him that is, and nothing! I asked the waiter to at least bring me some water (I was super dehydrated already) and...NOTHING!!! Finally, at the end of the movie, we complained to the waiter and he said he would get a manager. Guess what? A manager NEVER CAME!!! As I told my boyfriend that night, the difference in the comfort of the seats versus a Harkins or AMC is not large enough for me to overlook the extreme disappointment of having to wonder where the waiter is at every moment. I do not even know what happened in the movie!!! That is how preoccupied I got with where the waiter was, where the food was, and if I was even going to have water to drink!!! 

All in all, the seats are comfortable, of course, if not the theatre would not bring in any business, but I strongly recommend that you just invest in a recliner for your home instead. It is way less frustrating!"}
{"text":"I love iPic in that I don't like crowds and I hate the seat roulette, I also love being waited on :)

I am almost at a gold membership for this year, seriously Im there a few times a month, and there is only one reason this isn't a 5 star (it used to be).

The seats are becoming uncomfortable, I have even sat in a seat that was broken and the back would click in and out when I would recline (I only sit in premium). The back support is starting to lose the stuffing and I have been using my pillow and blanket to fill in. The seats are also becoming a bit stained.

I am hopeful that they will begin to re-stuff their seats and apply new coverings. Right now I have taken to ordering seats on the sides as they have less wear than the center seats I prefer."}
{"text":"The best!  Incredible theatres, seats, screen size, menu.  I can't imagine going back to Harkins or AMC after this experience."}
{"text":"Arrive early so you have time to explore the place & the food/drink menu. The entrance on the 2nd floor faces True Food & the splash pad. I ordered the soft pretzel starter which was pretty tasty. I wish the cheese sauce had been served warm.  Somehow I missed out on the bday perk even though I had joined their FREE loyalty membership several months ago. I think they give you a free birthday movie ticket which might be good for 2 weeks.  The premium seats were awesome. Definitely a nice splurge & you don't have to try to have dinner beforehand & then rush to make the movie."}
{"text":"We really enjoy iPIC as a luxury theatre experience. The only comments and feedback I have are: 
NEGATIVES 1). engaging your waiter/waitress after the movie begins in pitch black is difficult 2). if you have issues with your food or drink orders, you have to essentially flag them down or get out of your seat to get someone 3). they take your credit card with them, and then awhile later, return it 4). if you request special instructions on your food orders it takes a long time to get food remade 
POSITIVES 5). LOVE the recliners, blankets, pillows, and popcorn in the premier seating! 6). Love the variety of food items! 7). Fantastic wine and adult beverages selection! 8). AND .... they server COKE products! Yippee!"}
{"text":"Great for the movies!  Lovely to have a glass of wine and sit in comfortable chairs.  Pleasant service.  But for food service, head to True Foods downstairs.  Husband got food poisoning from the lobster sandwich.  The sliders I had were only average."}
{"text":"Clean, No Lines, and Alcohol! It doesn't get any better than this to go see a movie. Obviously a bit more pricey than going to the regular movies but for what you get it is worth it. Comfortable leather chair with a table ordered a bucket of coronas and sat back and relaxed.Perfect place for a date with the wifey. Reverse happy hour on Thursday and ladies night just as an fyi."}
{"text":"I heard about this place the same day I went, so not too many expectations. First off, the place is designed beautifully. However, it's a little unfortunate that kids, who seem to have no idea what they're doing, work there. We were greeted by a girl who was nice enough, but seemed to be confused as to why we were there (really?). The website asks viewers to come a minimum of 30 min before the movie starts. I'm pretty confused as to why since we weren't allowed into the theater till 5 min before it started. The boy that led us in was so stressed about saying the right things that he seemed totally confused as to the words that were actually leaving his mouth, very off putting and I couldn't wait for him to leave. Drinks weren't bad (or too pricey). We ordered calamari; not worth however much we paid, plus after the lights went down it was pretty difficult to see exactly what I was eating.
Overall, not a total waste! Ha...don't get me wrong, they started off pretty rocky but it was definitely an experience. I most probably wont be coming here every time I want to see a movie but once in a while wouldn't be a bad thing.
Try it out for yourselves, a one time experience here never killed anyone and you may fully enjoy yourselves."}
{"text":"I feel like I'm jumping on the bandwagon here but why not?
I never take my kids here because I like to come here to avoid kids. You don't usually see children here, especially in the evening. Don't hate me - I have kids, I love kids, I just don't like being in a crowded movie theater with them.
I came here recently to see Godzilla with a friend. I opted for the premium plus seating - for an extra $5 you get a lounge chair!  I like being able to order from a server who scoots around and whispers so others aren't bothered. 
Ok, Ok, maybe I will bring my kids here sometime for a matinee if they promise to be really good. However, the risk is that they'll never want to go back to a regular theater."}
{"text":"Love this place! Comfy reclining seats, good food and drinks, great service. I don't like going to the movies anywhere else!"}
{"text":"My wife and I first found this theatre when we moved here 2 years ago. We haven't been to any other theatre in AZ since! We love it here. You get to pick your own comfortable seats, the service is polite and usually pretty good at timing, the food is always great, free valet parking (which we love!) and the person's at the front counter are always friendly and helpful. All these things make it so easy to keep coming here :)"}
{"text":"Un cinema molto particolare l'iPic. Non vi. Aspettate il cinema o classico, qui è un concetto relativo: il ticket d'ingresso è abbastanza caro, ma comprende Poltrona Frau reclinabile elettricamente, copertina e cuscino, cameriere personale, un menù con tipici americani e se volete osare c'è anche una discreta selezione di vini italiani! In pratica siete al cinema, ma con moltissimi confort in più! Da provare!!!"}
{"text":"It was our first time there. We enjoyed it. Staff was very friendly, we got the premium seating and it was worth the extra bucks. They also provide a blanket & pillow. I Ordered a Caesar salad and was surprised by the way it came out ( it was not like a normal salad) I kinda felt awkward when I ask for a fork  the server said you use your fingers. 
Honestly we will be back again."}
{"text":"Beautiful lobby with cafe, wine bar, restaurant, and cocktail lounge (Salt). The experience of our group, however, was less than positive; nothing 'flows,' wait staff is borderline surly, and be careful on the iPics website ordering advance tickets; we wound-up in the front row, unintentionally. The manager, Phil, graciously refunded our 4-tickets and offered to buy us drinks (we declined, but appreciated the offer). Definitely worth checking-out iPics if you haven't been; proceed with caution is my best advice :-)"}
{"text":"It was an over priced experience to say the least. I am used to AMC and Harkins(low life movie experience)  Decided to take the wife to a nice place for her birthday. Went out to eat @ Scottsdale quarter then to the IPic.  Rude service people. The over priced \"snack bar\" employees. Gave my wife a hard time over not knowing how their self serve wine center worked. Seriously? Usually when things are high end they treat you over the top. Here it is the opposite. Total a-hole staff."}
{"text":"This place is really awesome very affordable price and it's worth it . Except it's not great when ur watching a good movie and parents brings there infant to the movies not cool"}
{"text":"First let me tell you this is by far the Best Movie Theater I have ever been to...

From the time you walk in the service is amazing!!!!

My husband and I went to see Trainwreck ( Which is a very very funny movie ), and from the seats, pillow, blankets and the popcorn.  Just Amazing.!!!!

We ordered Wine as well as food off the menu right when we sat down.

The girl that was our server was fantastic!!!!!   I am just sad I didnt take her name down but I will next time and update this review.

Its is so romantic to be in such a theater like this.....   

Id strongly recommend this theater for everybody........."}
{"text":"Just an update on my 3 experiences with iPic:

1) Great venue, beautiful, clean, gorgeous restrooms, pleasant wait staff & good food.

2) Saw 'True Grit' in Jan. 2011 - $17.50 per seat on a Saturday afternoon @ member price (personally purchased 4 seats & had 2 friends join us for a total of 6 seats) had great food - filet mignon sliders (3 sliders per order) WITH chips $15. Also - had a cosmo $9.00. AND - everyone got their own small FRESH popcorn bag.

3) Saw 'Harry Potter' 7/15/11 - $25.00 per seat (purchased 4 seats) - food still good but was told no chips or fries w/filet mignon sliders and price went up to $17.50 because you get 3 now instead of 2 (incorrect!). So I had to separately purchase fries! Had a Cosmo - now $10. POPCORN was stale & there was only 1, slightly larger bag for every 2 persons to share!

4) Just bought 3 tix for Saturday afternoon matinee show  - AT FULL PRICE OF $27 PER TICKET!! When I asked about the \"member price\" I was told that all the previously 'discounted member price' tickets had been \"promotional\" and that the theater was catching up with the pricing at the other locations around the country (true, I checked), except during weekdays & morning weekend shows! Needless to say, I was a BIG fan of iPic previously - telling my friends what a great experience iPic is & justify the $17.50/per ticket with the free valet & free popcorn. Now:  I am no longer a fan.  
In fact, the only reason I purchased the tickets at $27 each is because I promised a new, fantastic movie experience to my 80 yr. old mother who will join us.
 But really folks, in this economy how do they justify raising prices for less quality & quantity when they have been open less than 1 year?  No wonder there were no other seats sold for this show! I certainly hope consideration is given to the fact  that what they were doing in January 2011 was reasonable insofar as cost for goods/services received.  Because charging more for providing less is NOT. I am really hoping that at least this Sat., the popcorn doesn't taste like the giant bag of stale stuff you buy at Walmart and we each get our own bag."}
{"text":"This is the most amazing theater ive ever been too!! Its like being in a restaurant, combined with the niceties of home, merged with the most high tech theater system uve ever seen! 3D glasses are electrinic, comfortable, and work really well. A server will meet you as you walk in to the theater, give you a menu where you can order some of the most inovative cocktails from the bar, champagne, wine, and dinner or deserts! We ordered the champagne and cheesecake and it was devine!! Free popcorn with purchase of your showing and you can choose from a recliner or a regular seat, both of which ive only seen in homes, not theaters! Im hooked for life on this place! If you are looking for a decently priced adventure movie, or want to impress the one you love with all the wonderful service, this place is for you! 21+ only. With the price of the movie, and popcorn and drinks at a regular theater, this place is similar in price but comes with popcorn free.  

The servers are very attentive, yet do not disturb you during the film. The take orders during the first 20mins of previews and deliver in intervals that you set up. For example, we ordered 2 bottles of champagne, cheesecake, and popcorn. We said, bring the popcorn and first bottle first, and then at the half way point, bring the second bottle, and a little after that bring the cheesecake. She was right on schedule and it was an entirely stress free night!"}
{"text":"Possibly never going back to any other theatre... I just can't imagine watching a movie any other way ;-) Loved their lounge and attentive service, perfect place for a fun twist on the classic movie date night!"}
{"text":"FOOD POISONING!!!!  Our family came here for a 3pm showing. Myself, my husband and our daughter ate different entrees. Our son did not have anything but popcorn. Less than an hour after the showing, we were all violently ill (except our son). The bummer is we emailed management before posting here, and received NO RESPONSE!!!!! The kicker was it was my husband's birthday. Awesome to spend it throwing up all night. Thanks for the response I pic!!! Especially after $27 tickets and a minimum of $15 a piece food orders that made us throw up all night. By the way we are just feeling better. That's over 48 hours later. Well done on responding to our private email message, thinking you had enough class to respond in real human time and form."}
{"text":"My husband and I go to the iPic and usually have really good service, really good food and we have a great time. Unfortunately this time is the exception. Our first round of drinks that we had at the bar prior to the movie were terrible and the Tequila  that we usually get? they were out of. No big deal we chose different tequila and they remade our drinks. Then we went into the movie theater... our waiter didn't show up for a while and when he finally did he came and took our order and asked if we wanted to order a second drink for halfway through the movie, and we said yes. We never saw him at the halfway point. Our drinks were delivered by someone else our food was delivered by someone else, he finally showed up with 10 minutes left in the movie to bring us our second drink. I refused my drink he hadalready set my husband's down and he'd run off again. I saw other couples refusing their second round as well. When he brought us our check my husband said you can take this drink too I didn't even drink out of it and he goes well you might as well I took them off your bill. And walked off. Very frustrating experience overall especially when you pay that much money to go to a movie you expect at least adequate service. Get it together ipic."}
{"text":"As members of the Ipic Theater and living close the theater we like to come here when we watch movies out.  The environment and ambiance is great.  The parking is as simple as parking valet and letting Ipic stamp your ticket.  The premium seating is a must and they are very comfortable.  Add a pillow, blanket and some free popcorn and your set.  

A few things to know before visiting...Ipic is rather expensive.  $50 for two seats.  Glass of wine?  Maybe some food?  The tab starts to escalate quickly.  I wish there were more options for gluten free on menu so we typically have to be careful with what we order.  If GF is something that doesn't bother you, they do have a solid menu with variety.  

 It is a lot of fun and it is nice to place to splurge!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Saw finding dory on a Tuesday at 5:15. Was not crowded at all. I paid the extra $10 for the VIP seats up top. Let me tell you, these seats are comfortable! And they recline a lot! They provide a pillow and blanket too! And you get free popcorn! That's already worth the extra $10! 
We also had the service from a waiter and our guy was great. Wish I got his name. But very quick and easy and great menu! We both had a pizza. The margerhti and the meat lovers one. Both were delicious!!! The screen quality was very good. All in all I'm very happy with this place. The inside is immaculate and clean. The bathrooms are beautiful and clean as well! Ladies up front were very nice and helpful to describe what it's like since it was my first time!"}
{"text":"\"Don't be left in Coach seats when you can experience First Class\"

I've been here 3 or 4 times and have experienced both premium and premium PLUS seating.  If you are going to come here, BECOME a member online then buy your tickets in the premium plus seating.  You'll get the experience of IPIC at a savings.  (This is when you plan for date night with your wife). You can save up to $8.50 (total price would be $18.50) and get pillow and blanket, free bag of popcorn, and valet parking (Another $6.00 savings). You won't get junk mail, but you may get the occasional spam mail in your e-mail.  DON'T even bother with Premium (nonPLUS) seating. Chairs don't recline and are not comfortable.  You have to bring in your own food that you bought in the lobby.  None of the extras you would get in premium plus.  Your money is better spent at AMC Esplanade 14 or even Harkins theater.  You end up feeling like you are in coach class on an airplane. Seriously.  This would definitely make you look cheap on a date.  Guys take a lesson.  

IPIC is impressive in its appearance.  Has the look and feel of a trendy night club and bar. The Restrooms are also trendy as well.  Who would have guessed you needed all that in a restroom as well.  Also, I call it the Wine Vending Machine which is pretty cool and great selection. IPIC is very impressive in the premium plus furnishing, ambiance, and decor. 

What is not impressive is the food and service.  For what you are paying, the food is anything but memorable.  I guess they feel that if you are watching a good movie in a recliner, liquored up in the dark that your taste buds stop working.  Also when you need your waiter, you have to go out of the theater to get them or wait for them to come around to get their attention in the middle of the movie.  Bad experience especially when they get your order wrong.  AMC Esplanade did get this part right by using a \"call button\" at your seat.  At least on coach seats on your plane there is one as well.  

I would suggest that you spend your money on dinner before the movie outside the theater at the other restaurants, but come in only for your popcorn and desert and drink.  At least this way you have been well fed and can enjoy the IPIC experience.

If you find this review useful, cool, or funny please check below.  Thanks."}
{"text":"The premium seats here are worse then every other movie theater while being $17. They are so bad we had to go purchase the premium plus for ten dollars more per seat. So for $27 you get outdated recliner seats that are not nearly as good as cheaper theaters such as Desert Ridge. 

Staff is also rude about us upgrading our seats in a theater where there was a total of 6 people watching the movie. Making us provide our tickets 3 times in the middle of the movie to prove we paid for them. Seriously? 

Waiter was very rude when we did not order drinks through her, sorry we were told we had to get our own drinks if we bought there lowest base seat which they call premium. We were not aware those seats were not even worth watching a movie in. 

Sad this theater once was on the cutting edge of higher priced theaters and now has fallen sadly far behind. Save the money and pass on this theater."}
{"text":"I've been going to the movies ever since I was young and ipic theatre is the best way to see a movie you really want to see. With membership discounts and reserve seating, this theatre is definitely a must try! I am a big fan of the reserve seating you pick exactly where you want to sit and if you want a nice evening with your special someone. You can get full service in the theatre with blankets, a pillow and reclining chairs. Definitely a great place to see a movie!"}
{"text":"I'm a little bit concerned when I read the reviews of this theater and see people doubting whether they change out the used pillows and blankets between showings. Then Karen, the theater rep replies and doesn't clarify this specific issue. This to me is a clear admission that they do NOT wash them and change them out, which is disgusting, especially for the price being paid."}
{"text":"If you have money this place is great but really expensive, my 4 kids got nachos, I didn't see but the waiter ask with chicken, so kids said yes without thinking and next thing I know is that I payed $19.00 por child plus drinks... 
I never went back since then."}
{"text":"Although expensive, it is definitely a cool experience.  We ended up purchasing the upgraded seats for Transformers in 3D. The showing was fantastic, and the service was excellent. The 3D glasses were premium quality as well.  We ended up having food and a few cocktails.  If you go this way, you could be looking at spending over $100 for the night, easily!  If prices were a little more reasonable, this would be the perfect movie experience!"}
{"text":"This was a great movie theater experience, but a bit out of my budget. I took my boyfriend to see the Avengers on his birthday. It was super expensive, which I knew before going into this experience. I have to say though, the mojito was the best mojito I have ever had. EVER."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! My first time going and it was extravagant for a theater. The lounge chairs reclined and the food was very tasty."}
{"text":"Couldn't be more pleased with my experience at iPic Scottsdale! Visiting from Chicago, and took my grandparents for an afternoon show. They were blown away, as was I. From the moment we walked in, we were greeted by the lovely young hostess with a smile and a genuine welcome. The GM, Brian, took time out of his busy day to make us feel welcome and really provide a great experience as it was our first time at an iPic theater. The comfortable seats, film quality, and beautiful amenities made for the complete package. We will most definitely be coming back, and my grandparents hope to make it a regular activity. I hope downtown Chicago gets an iPic theater soon! There isn't anything parallel in the Windy City now that can compare."}
{"text":"I went to iPic for the first time with a group from work. We had planned the event for a couple weeks, and were going to enjoy a movie with appetizers and drinks in the afternoon.

The theater was just fine. I had no complaints with the seating arrangements or the cleanliness of hte theater. What we did experience, however, is something that needs to be addressed.

We were told that, along with our movie ticket and appetizers, we'd be getting a buttered popcorn per person. This did not happen. We were given no popcorn, and for a business that states that it's included, this is unacceptable. Even an offer would have been appreciated.

We all ordered off the menu, and many of us tried different items. The food, for the most part, tasted okay. Unfortunately, after the movie and as the afternoon progressed, a few of us started to not feel well. Of those of us who got sick, it was because we ate either the chicken flatbread or the sliders. We had upset stomachs and additional issues, and felt weak and queasy all afternoon.

Also, attached to iPic is the bar Salt. A week later, my work decided to have a happy hour function at Salt to try out the new place. Unfortunately, the service was awful. With a group of 20 of us, you'd think that a server or bartender would come serve us right? Wrong. We were standing around for 20 minutes without any acknowledgment of our presence. Finally, after one person asked for a server, they sent over one server to take all our drink orders while 2 other servers and 2 bartenders stood around not doing anything. Then, the drinks took entirely too long to make.

Along with this experience, we had preordered some appetizers with the manager beforehand. Not only did he not place the order, but when he was tracked down for them, he said he'd take care of it right away and didn't. Then he hid in the back and wasn't heard from the rest of the evening.

We will definitely not be going to this place again, which is unfortunate for them, as we work right across the street and have these events pretty often.

Do not go for the food or the service. You'll be disappointment (and made sick) by each."}
{"text":"Watched Fanastical Beasts movie there Friday night. Can't beat the seats, the comfort and the fact you can get food and beer brought to you! Great customer service and nice atmosphere as well!!!"}
{"text":"tourist on vacation!!! However this was the best movie experience I've ever been too!!! kick off your shoes & relax your feet! best way to watch a movie seriously. Cost a decent amount however you get good treatment!"}
{"text":"Wow, the most uncomfortable seat in town! Both my husband and I couldnt get pass this. You cant even look up to the as it doesnt recline and the head cushion is to big, forcing my head down. We did NOT buy the most expensive seat but for the overall experience, its not worth it to us. The screen an the theater itself was nice. By far a better experience at Studio Movie Grill... Better seats, they deliver the food to your seat, etc."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere to see a movie!  Comfortable and relaxing seats.  Pricey, but will be worth it when I plan on seeing a new release anticipated for weeks."}
{"text":"I HATE THIS PLACE!!!!!


I mean who created luxury theaters???? I've been twice and now because of this place I am ruined now from the other theaters.... So now when I want to see a movie I have to come back here.... Plush seats that recline, free valet parking, free popcorn, good service, good food.... Come on someone stop them!!!! 

But really great place and for the money hey it's a theater you know it's gonna cost you!!! But with a membership tickets for the upgraded premium seats is $17.50 ($14.50 + $3.00 for the upgrade) or non members pay $17.50 for a standard seat...

This place will spoil you!"}
{"text":"I loved the food here. I can tell it is not super healthy but I can appreciate a restaurant that just goes for the gold on the flavor end of their menu these days. Their drinks are incredible so be sure to at least order one before the movie if not when you are in there. I really liked that they had reverse happy hour (not sure on the times otherwise I would post them) and then you could take those drinks into the theater with you if you weren't done when the movie started.

The staff is very friendly and we always go back to see our favorite bartender, Woo. We met him on opening night there and always has great customer service, is hilarious, and most importantly makes GREAT cocktails! You should definitely ask for him if you go in.

The VIP seats are awesome too, I almost fell asleep in the movie to prove how comfortable they are. I wish it wasn't as expensive but the price point is as expected for a dinner theater and their service provided."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went here after hearing about it for awhile now. All I have known about this place is the price and nothing really else.

Well my sister and her boyfriend invited us out for an evening at this theater. After trying to get to tickets to the same show as them it was impossible (waited too long) we decided to try it anyways. Being my birthday weekend I decided to splurge a little extra. 

So I bought tickets to a movie for myself and my girlfriend. Arriving at the theater....well it was hard to find unless you know where it is. Valet parking is apparently complementary...yet we did not know until till arriving at the theater. I opted for the VIP seating. Why not...spend the extra $4 to have a super comfy seat and waiter service? Birthday after all....

After finding the place in the Scottsdale quarters it was quite easy. I bought tickets online so the process was simple. Walk up to the counter and get our tickets. The front counter person was extremely pleasant. After getting our tickets we wandered around checking out the bars within. If your a wine drinker they have some really interesting machines to dispense your wine. Me being a beer drinker they had a decent selection. Your normal ones, and then some microbrews. Cant complain too bad about the prices either. A little more expensive but yet...your in a movie theater, you should expect that.

Get to the theater and sit down. Waiter comes up to us with menus, explains the process etc. We both order another drink and it promptly arrived after we were almost done with our first ones. The seats are amazing...hands down. Super comfy, and you can adjust to how you want to recline. Blankets and pillows are also offered. Nice touch for the whole luxury setting.

Would i come back again? Maybe. I really cant seeing spending that much money just to see a movie. It was a great experience and we both left very satisfied. But the price gets to me. It is definitely worth checking out once or twice, but i cant see it being a regular thing for me."}
{"text":"i will never go to a regular movie theater again if i can help it! you can't beat the comfort, the blankets and pillows, and of course drinking some bubbles while you watch a movie. the only issue that comes with this is the mid-movie bathroom break you'll need  - but I could live in those bathrooms, seriously. They went over the top in the loo! So nice.

The kids that work there are a little clueless, but they mean well. I haven't eaten at the restaurant or gone to the bar yet, but I will!"}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times.  Once when it first opened and twice in the past few months.  The first time was great.  Unfortunately, my last two experiences have been beyond disappointing.  I am a \"member\" and upgraded to the highest level of seating.   The \"service\" was awful, the food was cold once it finally arrived, & they forgot many items we had ordered.  I am assuming our waiter was off of his game today due to the ridiculous couple with 2 young children next to us who was giving him a hard time about their champagne, beer and bottle of wine they needed for a 12:30pm movie but who knows.  What I do know is that I will never return."}
{"text":"The movie was awful but at least the seats were uncomfortable.

We've tried IPic twice now; not a fan.  For a 16.00 movie ticket I would at least like a comfortable seat without being forced to upgrade.  These \"cheap seats\" are angled such that you have to sit \"up and forward\" which is not conducive to a comfortable, movie-watching experience.  I expect the over-priced drinks and lame bar food but at least give me a comfortable seat!

Seriously, the wife and I had to slouch down and sideways to get comfortable; no thanks.

Somebody please bring back Farrelli's Cinema Supper Club!  THAT was a great way to have dinner and a movie."}
{"text":"Ipic is great for the premium seating, except if you are 5'10\" or taller, as one cannot fully extend the recliner footrest without the feet hitting the chair or half-wall in front of one's chair. This is extremely aggravating and is a big detractor from my movie going experience. The service is very prompt from clean, well-groomed wait staff who are for the most part professional and polite. 

The pricing is a bit steep, but that is to be expected with this sort of place. Don't plan on not coming out of pocket at least $50 for two people. However, this place is worth the reserved seating in the gold class section, the good food, and the comforting silence of no children allowed after 7pm. 

If you can get past the price, this place is absolutely wonderful!"}
{"text":"Please please please please please please please come to Nashville!!!! This is one of the coolest experiences!!! Great for a date or family adventure. If this were in Nashville I'd go to the movies soooo much more!! Plush, reclining seats, your own waiter, free popcorn, full cocktail and dinner service, and free valet.... Come on?!? Perfect movie experience!"}
{"text":"Poor service, overpriced.   We went to this theater a few years ago when it was new and loved it.  It's age is showing with squeaky swishy seats, plastic to-go cups in place of the glass tumblers from our last visit, and a lack luster staff.   Our server dumped our side of guacamole in my lap.  He brought more guac, but no napkins!  I had to ask.   Missed past of the movie cleaning my clothes and when I returned to my seat the mess was still there.  I used the napkins to line my seat so I could finish the movie.  The server avoided us the rest of the movie, bringing refills to our neighbors.  I get that you're embarrassed, but really?  Full bill came at the end too - $50 for two appetizers and soft drinks, no refills mind you.  Told the front desk gals on the way out so they could properly clean the chair.  Their reply was \"ok, thanks\".   Much better service and concern at Harkins.   That's where we'll go next time..."}
{"text":"First of all, this is not a place I would go to often since I don't have money to burn. However, it is a fun place to go once in a while & switch it up from the \"normal\" movie going experience. My girl Vanessa & I had planned a girls night & decided to check out Ipic for dinner & a movie. I'm glad she suggested we book our tickets early. It was a Tuesday & the Gold class seats ($17.50 each if you're a member-sign up for free on their website) were about 50% booked for the No Strings Attached (kinda cute but overall lame movie!) showing on Friday at 7:30pm. 

I got to Ipic around 7pm & dropped my car off at valet (which is included w/the Gold class seating price). V was already there at Salt having a cocktail. Apparently the bartender named some fruity vodka concoction after her & it was really yummy so I said I wanted one too. I guess he thought I meant my own signature cocktail b/c he made me a completely different drink. I can't tell you what was in it b/c he didn't say & I didn't ask, but I saw him spray what I think was rose water b/c there were 2 rose petals floating in my drink. It was pretty good but the \"Vanessa\" was better. I'm not sure how much he charged us for the drinks since the dude Vanessa was w/paid for them.

Our movie was about to start so we brought our drinks w/us into the theater (I loved that we could do that!). We were escorted to our seats & were brought out blankets & pillows. The seats were so dang comfy! The blankets were super soft but I was weary to put the pillow behind my head since it didn't have a case on it, but that's just me, I'm sure they were fine. Previews were about to start so we quickly scanned the menu & decided on the nachos w/chicken ($10) & calamari ($12), V ordered a glass of red wine ($12 for 5 oz) & I ordered a glass of champagne ($8). Soon after we placed our order we received our free popcorn, it was ok, not as good as Harkins/AMC. The food was nothing special & it's hard to eat in the dark w/out spilling on yourself, so we only had a few bites each & I took the rest home to my hubby. When I come back I think I'll just stick to drinks & skip the food altogether. 

I'd love to come back w/my hubby for a date night & also stop by the champagne bar next door."}
{"text":"We love this place and try and go every chance we get. If we ever want to treat ourselves we go here. Staff is always on point and if not they go out of their way to correct it. 
Reclining chairs are always comfortable, as are the pillows/blankets.
Menu items have always been great quality especially truffle fries.
I love the small theater feel as well.
People who come here and pay that much are not going to use their cell phone the whole time which is a plus as well.
Sign up for membership for deals, contests and member perks."}
{"text":"I took our 15 year old Grand Daughter to see \"Max\" today. We loved this theater experience. Got the premium tickets. The popcorn was delicious with the added butter. Our meal of pizza, lobster roll and sweet potato fries was so good! And as other reviews have noted, the fries stayed crispy throughout. Our seat were plush and comfortable and the pillows and blankets were a nice touch. I will definitely be back with my husband next time!"}
{"text":"Most people watch movies in their average theater just for the experience they get from the large screen and expensive sound system.  They rent movies so they can sit comfortably on a big couch at home, while maybe drinking a cocktail.  At iPic not only do you get the great sights and sounds that only a theater can produce, but you also get to sit in a comfortable sofa seat that reclines at the push of a button.  You get quiet and efficient seat side service for all your food and drink needs. Oh and you get a pillow and a blanket to get you just that much more comfortable!  This isn't a cheap theater, it's not supposed to be.  If you want a great experience and feel like really treating yourself well, head over to iPic theater for some great food, entertaining drinks, and luxury movie watching experience."}
{"text":"I really love going to iPic for special occasions or for big midnight showings, it's so worth it. I'm a loyal follower of some popular movie franchises, and booking an advance ticket is about a million times better than waiting in line. Here are some things I love about iPic:

THE DRINKS: Very decent cocktails and the WINE CARD. I have a refillable card that I juice up when I go. The Wine Fountain is just fun. Normally I grab food and bring it in with me, but sometimes I order extra wine or desserts in premium seating. 

The reviews are true, you have to sit in premium to get service, but it's worth the extra 5 bucks. You also get a blanket and a pillow to keep you extra comfy. I've sat in the normal seating before with the food I got beforehand and was perfectly comfortable, but being able to recline and get waited on is obviously better. I sit up front when it's not a special occasion, or I'm dying to see a movie and it's the only spot left.

THE FOOD: It's pretty good considering that it's a movie theater, I'm always pretty satisfied with it. However, like I said before, I usually come for the drinks and just snack. The entrees are a bit pricey for what you get.

THE SERVICE: I've never had a problem with customer service at iPic, and I've been there 10+ times now. Always friendly and fast. One time we had a waiter who forgot to bring out one of our appetizers, we forgot about it too, so it wasn't a big deal. We let him know and he took it off our bill and comped our soft drinks, he apologized profusely. If you're not a jerk about it, they'll take care of you. These things happen.

ATMOSPHERE: Amazing, luxurious, comfortable. It feels like you're in Kanye West's private movie room. It's really unlike any theater, and that alone is why I love coming to iPic.

For the bad reviews, you have to understand that this isn't an AMC. It's not meant for the lazy thursday night with nothing to do (unless you're wealthy, then stop reading). You're going to spend a good chunk of change when you go. This place is great for a date night, holiday, birthday, or a fancy solo night. I've been here a couple times alone, and I feel a bit more comfortable than a traditional theater. Walk in with a flexible budget, and you'll have a great time. 

Pro Tip: Sign up to become a member, and you'll get a sizable discount on all of your tickets plus a free dessert on your birthday."}
{"text":"iPic... How I LVE you so....

Since iPic Scottsdale opened in Dec., 2010 I have not been to any other theater, since. I've seen every movie, in theater exclusively at iPic for the past 7 years. Even when we travel, if we want to see a movie, we find an iPic Theater. We're very loyal. We're Platinum members & to give you an idea, we've seen 5 movies this week alone at iPic Scottsdale.

If you buy Premium Plus seats, it starts with the free valet. Then, you walk through the doors & are greeted by the most wonderful front desk staff, imaginable. They give you your tickets (if you've reserved online) or you can purchase them right there. I HIGHLY suggest becoming a member. It'll save you money on the tickets ($25/ea) & you can earn points with any food/drink/ticket purchase throughout the building. (minus alcohol, tax, etc..) Get there early & get a drink from the bar. They have so many great drinks & the bartenders are amazing! If you're not sitting in the premium plus section, don't forget to go by & order food for your movie, opposite the bar. The food is GREAT! I highly recommend...EVERYTHING! lol! Lately, I've been getting the pretzels or nachos... yum! My kids love the chicken tenders or the chicken skewers.  I go through phases & have tried everything on the menu that's vegetarian. They have added some really great options like the veggie kabobs, also really good! They've been changing the menu more often than in the past, which is really nice for regulars, like us. I'm still waiting for the day they figure out how to get pasta on the menu.... HEAVEN!!

Once you get in the theater, there's plush seats that recline, with a pillow & blanket. Each chair has it's own tray & every grouping of 2 chairs has an extra cup holder. They bring you complimentary popcorn, all you can eat! The AMAZING staff, will take your order & check on you throughout the movie. I haven't met a server I didn't like. They're all so great! 

The bathrooms in the theater are AMAZING. You have to see them, to believe them. Super luxe & always clean! 

Tanzy is the restaurant attached to the theater. It's just beautiful! It has the most beautiful ambiance & great views. The food is incredible. I've seen a few private parties going on (since it's the holidays) & they look like such a blast! I highly recommend having parties here, either in the theater or at Tanzy. The bar or at Tanzy is also a great place to watch Football games. 

I've gone to some special events at iPic over the years & they are so much fun! They do a lot of cool events for Gold & Platinum members. I've also noticed that there's a live magic show coming up in Feb. I'm really looking forward to that! iPic does a GREAT job at rewarding those who are loyal. It's such a nice touch. It was such a beautiful surprise to get the amazing Christmas gift from iPic, this year. They really do care about their customers! 

As you can tell, we love iPic. Especially, iPic Scottsdale! It's our favorite place to go & my favorite recommendation to give to those visiting from out of town! Thanks iPic for 7 incredible years of entertainment! We truly appreciate you more & more, everyday!!!

XO,
Britt
& Threatt Family...."}
{"text":"I  really wanted to like this place.  We've been several times now, and this was our last trip.  The theater and location is great, but the service is horrible.  We saw a matinee today and paid $50 for 2 of us to have horrible service.  We pre-ordered 3 drinks each and food.  Our first drink took about 15 minutes,  the 2nd drink arrived an hour and a half later.  At that time, I asked about our food.  The couple next to us never received theirs, either.  Our final drink came about 10 minutes when the movie was ending, and our food never came, even though I reminded our server.  She told me she forgot to put it in and offered to bring us a complimentary dessert.  We declined.  The other times we have visited, we have had slow service, too.  This was the final straw, though.  We spoke to the manager who offered to give us movie tickets, but we declined.  Save your money and go to a much better place that has a similar concept- Farrelli's.  The service and food are much better!"}
{"text":"Customer service is unfortunate. Waited on hold for 20 minutes, eventually just hung up. AMC has similar setup with better pricing."}
{"text":"Visiting from San Diego and came here for the first time. Wow, how can I ever watch a movie in a theater again if it's not like this? You know, I even fell asleep during the movie but I dont care - it was AWESOME."}
{"text":"So this week my husband and I decided to try Ipic in scottsdale and Ultralux theater at Indian bend. I am writing a review for both so feel free to check out the other one as well. First, this theater is amazing in presentation. Very upscale and comfortable. We bought the gold seats on a weekday at 5 pm online. The cost was $50 for the two of us. Upon arrival we were greeted by the very friendly staff and take to our reserved seat so no worrying about running for a good seat. The seat reclined and was made of a micro-suade. By far the most comfortable seat ever and reclining seats are the big seller point. Then the waiter came and took our order of an extensive upscale list and matching price. We had the salad with goat cheese and vinagarette which was pretty nice although hard to eat in the dark and I had the steak sliders which are served medium rare and were outstanding and easy to eat. My husband had the chicken skewers and asparagus which he really enjoyed. I would say the only downfall to this theater which I really hope they fix were things that may be just growing pains but should be mentioned. First they tote that the luxury seats have blankets and pillows which I LOVE.. But I had to ask after about 20 minutes into the movie and then they brought me a only a blanket. This was one of the things I was looking most forward to. Also we ordered too much food and had ask 3 different people for the container that they told me at the beginning they gave if we ordered to much and even then we had to go in and out the theater to get a container. Last, the pen they use to sign for credit card purchases. The light is actually on the other side of the pen so you have to keep flipping it over to see where you are writing in the dark which is amusing and impossible. Really recommend pens with the light that is one the end of the pen you write with. It was way to dark the see what you wre writing. All in all a great theater and hope they fix those little things that will make it a true A+++"}
{"text":"Went on a bad day but they made it all better. They go above and beyond to take care of you. I recommend you get there early to order your food and beverages so you do not do that once the movie starts. They have a great staff. Lawrence makes sure everything runs smooth."}
{"text":"This place is so cool. It's a shame the service sucks! Took 10 minutes to get 1 drink and 30 to get a second drink. We only saw our server twice and all our food came out wrong. We left before the movie was over because we were that annoyed"}
{"text":"$75 to see a movie (two people)
Premium seating: If you are 6\"0 or taller, your feet will hit the chairs in front of you when you recline. Great food, good service. I've done it once, probably won't be doing it again. If you want good food and good drinks, try a different spot other than a movie theatre."}
{"text":"My wife and I got a voucher for free gold level tickets and $120 worth of food. What could go wrong? Well, first of all try finding the place. Buried in the heart of Scottsdale Quarter you'd better leave early or do research on finding it in there. (Hint: Look for Tanzy signs. There is no iPic signage on the exterior of the building. It's on a second floor hidden between Tanzy and Salt- the associated restaurant and bar.) The decor was very upscale and arty. 
The service was slowwww. It took forever to get a glass of water or our drinks. The lights went out before we could finish reading the menu. Our server, while very friendly, seemed overwhelmed trying to explain how everything worked to too many patrons while filling orders.
The reclining seats were comfortable but my feet end up next to the head of the poor person ahead of me. The digital movie quality and sound was outstanding. Eating in the dark was challenging. The complimentary popcorn was nice.
Our food was good. Reasonably priced for upper class Scottsdale ($9-$15). If you like a lot of ice in your mixed drinks you'll love these. Stick to non-ice based drinks. My draft Killians was $6 but  my wife's margarita was $17.
Overall, I would do this once in a great while for a special occasion. I would recommend trying it for the novelty. It is quite a unique experience."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time I went to iPic. I thought I would give them another chance because I really want the experience they promise.

This place is like being in First Class on the nicest airplane... without any flight attendants.  We arrived early enough to have dinner at Tanzy.  The quality of the food and presentation are very good, although I don't know if I would go to Tanzy unless I was seeing a movie there.

As for the iPic itself... we sat in the Gold Class seating which promises reserved seating, valet parking, reclining seats, complimentary popcorn, and in-theater service.  The first time I was here I got the regular Premium Seating which just has reserved leather seats.

The seats are very nice and they do recline so you can really relax just like you might at home with a nice high end recliner.  We didn't take advantage of the valet parking but if you do, you simply get it validated at the box office.

Complimentary popcorn... I was never offered any.  I have seen other reviews on here that have said that also so that is a recurring theme.

Now if there is one aspect of going to iPic that should stand out from other theaters, it's the in-theater service.  We were one hour and fifty-three minutes into our movie before the server approached us for service.  She asked us if someone was helping us so she must have just started her shift or was moved to another section.  The movie had 10 minutes to go before it was over and she was handing us menus!  We ordered a drink and it arrived in about 5 minutes.  We gave her $20 and she said she would be right back with the change.  She never came back.

Overall, it's all sizzle and no steak.  If I ever go back, I'll just get the premium seating and go to the snack bar myself.  At this point, the only real advantage is that you have reserved seating so you don't have to fuss with getting to the theater early to get a good seat.

****************************************************************************
This is my review of the first time I experienced iPic:

I love the idea of this place and was really looking forward to going to an upscale theater with all the accouterments.  The design and layout of the place is fantastic with the exception that it is not readily apparent to know where to go once you are inside. You have no idea where the auditoriums are because things aren't like a normal theater layout.  I was hoping that there would be a little more attentiveness from the staff.  The cashier should have told us where to go to.  The concierge (ticket taker) should have told us what to do next. For example, do we go to our seats or should we head to the snack bar?  In a traditional theater, the ticket taker has told us where the snack bar is and I expect at least that much from a premium theater.

Once we found out seats we patiently waited for the touted seat service and hoped someone would come by to take our snack order.  We arrived 20 minutes early for the 3PM showing of True Grit (great movie by the way).  Not once did anyone come by to take our order, offer a blanket, or anything else.  We were ignored the entire time.  Maybe you need to sit in the VIP section to get that service.  I did not think that was a requirement for seat side service but maybe it is.

I will go back again and give it another try.  I LOVE the idea of this place, but the execution of it leaves me wanting more.  Maybe they will get the kinks out or maybe they just expect the patrons to figure it out on there own.  I really hope that it was because they were so new or I can't see this place staying in business if they are not going to deliver an exceptional night out.

UPDATE: I have been informed that the seat side service is for VIP only so that would be why we didn't get seat side service.  Even after knowing this, I went back to their website to see if I could see that distinction made when purchasing the tickets.  I don't see it, so just be aware that you need to be in the premium seats if you want the full experience."}
{"text":"Always an enjoyable experience at ipic, whether casual chick flick nite with the BFFs or date nite with ur hunny bunny. Any seat is a great view, standard seating is still awesome in its own right, just buy your munchies before u enter, grab a glass of vino at the self serve and ur good to go. Obviously when we occasionally splurge on the premo seats on a cool winters eve, the pillow, blanket and recliners ramp it up to a 5* nite! 

Food is not your standard franchise hotdogs but an offering of scrumptious gourmet sliders, truffle frites and salads. Evian is upgraded to the lux VOSS so you don't dehydrate in the desert heat. Come one come all, summer blockbuster season is on! And Ironman 3 is simply our opening aperitif!"}
{"text":"We went to see The Adventures of Tintin over the Holidays. This was our first experience at an iPic Cinema, and we invested in the \"whole experience\". 
Loved the comfy reclining seating, and the food and beverage service. While we will return and give iPic Scottsdale Quarter one more shot (the manager was the greeter...he was awesome), we were disappointed in a couple things:

-One of our theater blankets had sticky candy stuck in it-NOT appealing. You would think they would at least have a standard of checking the \"comfort\" amenities if they aren't offering cleaned or unused blankets. Even the airlines do a better job here.
-The bathroom (both men's and women's) were filthy and not maintained. Really?
We understand the crowd is a little younger, and there is sharing going on with the  lounge/restaurant up there, but there should be standards maintained for this entertainment center.
-The 3-D glasses were heavy and very touchy-if you moved you'd see a blurry screen-the clarity through them not consistent. We both had issues until we figured out how to minimize movement.

I love to give great reviews! Hopefully our next experience will be 5 star."}
{"text":"Went last night for the New Years Eve package. Decently priced deal for a movie plus dinner plus wine (at least when compared to many fixed priced deals for an NYE package at most any restaurant). Appetizers were served buffet style and were only ok. Dinner and dessert served while watching the movie were surprisingly good. The staff throughout was excellent. The staff, for at least this evening, were worth five stars."}
{"text":"Although I'm giving five stars please keep in mind that this place is not cheap but it's completely worth it!

I discovered this place by word of mouth. My mom's friend kept raving about this amazing \"Cinematic Experience\" I went online and did a little research. I decided to splurge and get two premium seats for a Mommy/daughter date on a Sunday afternoon. First off, let me say that you'll want to get the premium seats because they lean back AND you get to put your feet up! We got to order lunch and have it brought out to us. We also had popcorn, a drink, pillow and a blanket. This was all included in our package, except for the food of course. I had the grilled chicken flatbread and it was pretty tasty. My mom had the sliders and fell in love! All in all it was an amazing experience. I would like to go back and try their \"Wine Bar\". 

This is definitely a place for dates and for once in a blue moon occasions."}
{"text":"Pros

Good Non-Imax theatre
Good selection of drinks and food
Big seats for people 6'0 and shorter


Cons

Bad wait service.
No service button.
Dirty seats.
Seats have bar in middle, must use pillow to mitigate discomfort
At 6'2 feet will rest on seat in front of you.

Lets be sensible, its a theater I don't expect a miracle. But for premium seating.....

However, this was the worst service i've had in a very long time.  I ordered a drink and meal and was ignored until the end of the film.  As anyone ordering an alcoholic drink knows, if you have to hunt down another drink in the middle of dinner... your distracted, and irritated.  I ultimately got another but had a cold dish to go with it.  It just made the film so-so.  The film wasn't great but that's not the theatres' fault.  I came for the film and top notch service, the service was rotten.

Go to the esplanade for catered movies, they have a seat button for service, Ipic does not."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place, but after so many tries and \"chances\" it becomes more and more difficult. The seating is great (I recommend the premium plus seats) and very comfortable. The menu is so so, and could certainly use some creativity and occasional new items. However, eating in the dark doesn't leave a ton of room for culinary creativity, so I think they are doing the best the can. 

Here's where the trouble comes in.....the service. It's somewhere between below average and painfully awful. I have been here many, many times, so I don't consider myself a novice and wouldn't pass judgment after one or two bad experiences. The service is just always a problem. It's rare to be greeted quickly, regardless of when you arrive. This makes the idea of getting there early and ordering dinner before the movie pretty irrelevant. Once a server does take your order, you most likely won't see them again until they drop off your check. The check back rule after you get your food doesn't exist here. The food is always delivered by a food runner that is on a mission to dump your plates and run out of there as fast as possible. From then on, you are basically on your own and better hope for the best that you don't need anything. On several occasions my check has been wrong, extra items added or even left off, my credit card missing, etc...then have to search out my server after the movie.

The whole thing is really frustrating. What a great idea that just isn't executed well. Have I offered the management feedback? Yes, in fact 3 times. Twice in person and once by email. Their response: \"thanks for the feedback, we're working on it\".  I think you've have had more than enough time to \"work on it\"."}
{"text":"The concept is great, very comfortable seats. Book ahead of time because we got stuck in the front row! We do not have ipic where we live and were excited to go, I was disappointed that the different \"levels\" weren't explained to us, we probably would have seen another movie if we knew we could have a server up top.
If you are someone that likes to eat healthy, spend your money elsewhere. The food was overpriced and not very good. My husband got a turkey sandwich and the turkey tasted old, and my sliders were greasy and mostly bread!! Also it's really inconvenient to have to go get your food (once again wish I would have known about different sections) I recommend this for the movie but like I said, skip the food!"}
{"text":"This place is grossly overpriced.  Not even worth the time to write a detailed review.  If you like being ripped off go here."}
{"text":"Seats are comfortabIe and the food is delicious. I will definitly recomend ipic to everyone."}
{"text":"The place is beautiful. The prices are expensive.
We ordered dinner,  burgers and fries, the cook made the fries place them on the window, and then started the burgers, when ready, the fries were cold.
The tables in the theater are not big enough to place food and drinks, and then you stay for 1 1/2 hour with dirty dishes all over. Poorly organized."}
{"text":"Won't be back!

I was looking for a new place to take my husband for a birthday celebration; I found ipic Theater and thought I would give it a try. I purchased the tickets online. The website doesn't explain the details very well of how the place works. I had an option of picking Premium seats or Premium Plus seats. Premium seats were $34 for the two of us and Premium Plus seats were $74 for the two of us. I could not figure out what Premium Plus offered that would make going to a movie theater worth $74. I purchased the Premium seats (I'm not cheap just couldn't see spending $74 on a movie).

We arrive at the theater after searching for a parking place for quite some time. The movie attendant greeted us and let us know that we had Premium seats and that if we wanted any food or drinks we would need to stop at the concession stand and pick those up before entering the theater. My husband and I were shocked that we had to get our own food and drinks. We had just ate at Maggiano's so we didn't want food anyway so we were fine with the self serve but still wondering why we paid $17 for ticket that we don't even get wait service.

We find our seats in the Premium section (E row). The seats are a nice distance from the screen but wait....these seats don't even recline. As we sit there watching the movie we realize that our headrest is pressing our head forward and we are getting a neck ache and my husband even got a headache from the way the headrest pushed on his head. 

My understanding from talking to people (which I should have done ahead of time) is that if I would have got the Premium Plus seats they would have reclined and I would have got a pillow and blanket (not into the reusable blanket and pillows). In addition we would have received free popcorn and waiter service. 

Why would I go back to this poorly thought out \"upscale\"  theater when I could go to the Esplanade at the Biltmore pay less ($12.50 a ticket) and have a waiter/waitress bring me my food and drinks and have a very comfortable reclining chair that my husband and I are able to snuggle in (chair arms go up). I can even go to Arrowhead AMC and have a very comfortable experience. iPic Theater is not what you would expect and not worth the money."}
{"text":"Had a great time on my first visit. Food and service at Tanzy was very good. Liquor and beer selection is excellent! Upscale movie experience was promised and delivered. The decor was very modern and well done. I wish I knew my servers name for the movie. She was really great! My biggest reservation going in was the servers would disrupt the move, totally not the case. They are prompt and deliver there service like a ninja. I was at a showing of \"Arrival\" on tues 12/6 at 430. Hopefully this gets our server some recognition she deserves it. My wife and I will definitely be in again."}
{"text":"Premium seats were awesome but I think 18 a ticket is a little pricey. The free popcorn was nice. We originally bought the regular seats and they were the worse movie seats ever. We had a neck/back ache before the previews started, plus popcorn was not on the menu. We went and upgrade and was worth the $4 a seat. Probably won't go again. Very expensive evening for a Tuesday."}
{"text":"They charged my credit card twice for the same ticket.  I called twice to complain, but they would not credit my card the $18.50.  I have spent over $2,000 at this theater. By all means go to this theater, but don't be surprised when they double charge your credit card and do not expect a refund when they do.  If I see another charge on my card from iPic, it will be totally fraudulent because I will never patron this theater again.  Also, no reason to overspend for the exact same entertainment I can get a few blocks away for less than half the price."}
{"text":"This place rocks!!   To be able to kick my feet up, drink my wine, have a blanket handy, and watch a movie was a great experience.  I only tried the dessert so maybe next time I'll try some of the pizzas."}
{"text":"The service and food have gone way downhill. Asked for popcorn and never had it brought to me. 30 minutes later I flagged down a different worker and asked for popcorn yet again and didn't receive it until another 20 minutes later. I also ordered a bottled water before the movie even started. I got all of my food and was still waiting on my drink. I had to flag down another worker yet again and didn't receive it until the movie was almost over."}
{"text":"EXPENSIVE! It's a nice theater but i prefer a regular theater. Their super comfy seats (premium)  were only ok and they made noises when u move around."}
{"text":"I really  enjoy the dine in theater experience and this place has it down to a T. The tickets are a little pricey but for all that's included I find it well worth it. I love the seating and the fresh, warm popcorn is always a plus.  I love soming here if I'm going to watch a movie that is more than 2 hours long because its almost as good as the comfort of my own home. It is a far drive but the great service makes up for it."}
{"text":"Great concept, but there are some real issues that keep it from being a 5* experience. The seats in the Gold Class section, as others have mentioned, were put too close together meaning that when your seat is fully reclined the feet of the person directly behind you are on your head. There's also a metal bar that you can distinctly feel mid-back when the seat is reclined. Service is friendly, but it's very slow and they don't come around often enough. We only saw our server twice and I made sure to order two drinks the second time because I had a feeling it would be the last time we saw her. 

I'm not sure if they can fix the seats, but service is an area that they can definitely improve the experience here. If service was more attentive and swift, I would give iPic 4*. Somehow fix the seats and the service and it's a 5* experience. With both of those things fixed, I would be more than happy to pay $17.50 for every movie I see and go out of my way to see movies here. As it stands now, we'll probably go back at some point, but they definitely won't be getting all of our movie dollars."}
{"text":"I have a low tolerance for pretentious BS, but can cope with it if a place delivers goods and/or service on par with the hype.  iPic does not.  We opted for \"Premium\" seating, which at $17 per ticket, is basically a comfy (non-reclining) chair with an armrest table.  Nice enough, but I didn't find it to be much better than a traditional cinema experience.  After sitting there for about 10 minutes, it became clear that we did not have a server, and that I would need to visit the concession stand.  I've never been to a \"dinner\" cinema that didn't have food and beverage service in the theater.  In all fairness, there was an \"Ultra Premium\" seating option for an extra $10 per seat.  Maybe they get reclining seats and food service?  I'll never know cause I'm not going back to iPic."}
{"text":"iPic is the only way to go. The reclining seats, the nice blanket and pillow, great Tanzy menu... I just love this place and the staff never fails to satisfy."}
{"text":"Carlos C. said it well!  

Having a reserved seat and not having to get to the theater 45 minutes early to see a new movie is worth every penny.  Seats are comfy and you can order a drink.  What is there not to like?"}
{"text":"I have allowed my husband for the past few years to deter me from going to iPic because we could go to Studio Movie Grill for one-third the price and still have comfy reserved seats. (He had been here before, but I had not.)  No offense to the SMG, but on a semi-discounted mid-day week day, this was worth the price of admission and then some!  Really, comparing these two are like apples and oranges, or more like Ruth's Chris to In 'n Out Burger.  Both are great at what they offer, but it depends upon what you want out of the experience.

First of all, this felt like a real date with my hubby . . . the all out wine and dine with a movie. We were in the high-end seats which recline, and ones that are just two together, instead of an entire row of seats. I didn't notice anything else going on in the theater. Contrary to some people's opinions, the servers never distracted my view. This has always been a problem for me at SMG as servers are always ducking in front of the screen.  Not so at iPic.  We also ordered off the menu -- we were both delighted with appearance and taste of everything we ordered . . . The Chinois Chicken Salad Rolls were delicious and filling. The Buffalo Chicken Spring Rolls were heavenly. You could taste all the flavors of the blue cheese and buffalo sauce with tender chicken. And lastly, we had the Loaded House Baked Potato Chips -- plenty to share . . . for two or maybe even more.

The menu at the adjoining restaurant Tanzy looked tempting, so next time we might have brunch first on the weekend and then do the movie. 

Bravo to iPic . . . an Academy Award in my book!"}
{"text":"I wish Cali had a theatre like this where I live. I love how someone can take your order for you while you watch a movie (on a recliner), sip on a cocktail, wine, or beer.  I love their self serve vending machine for wine too!"}
{"text":"Went to see Zero Dark Thirty the other night....great movie experience.
The seats are amazing and blanket and pillow included....worth every penny.
We had sliders and tater tots....amazing also....and a glass of wine.
Everyone should try this awesome movie experience!!!
Excellent staff and service first class...."}
{"text":"What's great about this place is the chairs, assigned seating the servers bring you your food and popcorn that's what's great."}
{"text":"A comfy recliner, 22 oz. craft beer, blanket, and a bag of warm popcorn.  What could be better than a Wednesday afternoon at the Scottsdale iPic?  Pretty much nothing."}
{"text":"I love the idea, and after a friend treated my seven year old and me to a similar experience at a different theater, my daughter is hooked on eating lunch while watching movies.  So, we decided to try iPic today on the spur of the moment.  Have to say that the $50 admission for one adult and a child before even ordering lunch was honest to goodness sticker shock.  Perhaps because I see mostly kids' movies with my daughter, which are usually matinees (but so was this one), tickets are usually in the $15 to $20 range for both of us.  Was the blanket, little pillow and recliner worth the extra $30?  It was a fun difference, but I'd have to say no.  The food was OK, but my daughter didn't like the chicken strips, which is really a pretty hard kid favorite to mess up, so she filled up on fries and popcorn (the popcorn is included with the $50 admission, as is valet parking).  I had a flatbread pizza, and some fries, and it stayed with me the rest of the day, and not in the best way!  Perhaps I just made less than optimal choices from the menu.  The girls at the box office did say that if I became a member tickets were less expensive, but I guess I was out of luck on my first trip.  The whole outing ended up costing $85 (with no beer, wine or cocktails) which makes me think there's a whole lot of other entertainment choices out there for $85.  And I know if I frame it that way for my daughter, we won't be back very soon or very often unless there's a Groupon or other discount out there, and I do think there have been some, and we'll probably just order a snack or some drinks, but not a whole lunch.  I'd also have to agree with some other reviewers in that it does take a while to get your food - I guess perhaps it's best to show up 20 minutes or so before the movie starts if you want to eat with the opening credits.  I had to request a kids menu even though the server had already stopped by to greet us and I thought that perhaps we had come to a place where they didn't cater to kids, and I didn't even know drink refills were an option!  The servers are pretty scarce once they drop your food off - I guess they are tying to walk the line of keeping patrons happy while also staying out of the way of the movie."}
{"text":"Premium price but worth the extra cost if you have the cash to burn. Fantastic place for date nights, will definitely impress."}
{"text":"Honestly, I haven't been able to go to a regular theater since I experienced iPic for the first time two years ago. Super comfy chairs with the vip purchase (reclines with popcorn, service & a blanket), the regular seating is still relatively comfortable, just not as great as the vip. The only thing, is it can be super pricey. Still love it though!"}
{"text":"Love love love the good in the movie theatre, I don't recommend going to the Resturaunt next four... Service is way too slow"}
{"text":"Such a fun date experience! So comfortable and seriously worth the extra ticket price. Not only was the theater posh, the lobby and whole experience was hip and luxurious. 

My boyfriend and I upgraded to the premium plus seats. Be sure to sign up for a membership on their website -- it's free and saves a lot! Our premium seats, with the upgrade price, came to $17.50 each for a Tuesday afternoon flick. It included popcorn (we each got a huge bag!), an ultra comfortable reclining chair, and a pillow & blanket. My boyfriend, who is very picky on what he considers a comfortable seat, was in love with the comfort! That says a lot. The theatre was kind of warm when we walked in but they must have turned the temp down quickly because it was 115* outside and shortly after the film started I was cold and in need of my blanket. Nice!

We ordered dessert from a friendly server right from our chairs. I got the chocolate cake, which was really rich but very delish, and my boyfriend got the brownie ice cream sandwich which was huge and could easily feed 2-4 people. The brownie was a bit tough, but he still said he liked it. I believe each dessert was $7-8. We also ordered waters. 

Our desserts actually came before the previews started. I was surprised by this as it seemed most reviews said it came 20ish minutes after previews. I wish I would have specified for it to not come right away. Oh well, no biggie. I'll know to do that next time so I can enjoy dessert with the movie playing!

It would be nice if there was more room between rows -- we didn't have anyone behind us,  but I can easily see how it would be hard to not kick the person in front of you/be kicked in the back of the head from someone behind you when reclining. The guardrail from the aisle was also obtrusive & kind of annoying.

I would definitely go here again! Very fun date -- not just the movie but also the bar in the lobby and overall atmosphere. I won't see another 3D movie there though. Theater was kind of small so it made me kind of dizzy and the glasses were uncomfortable after awhile -- boo. 

Overall, 2 thumbs up! Will be back for a special occasion or a cool movie I really want to see. Well worth admission."}
{"text":"I will be coming back!! Perfect for family outing and especially date nights!"}
{"text":"Heard a lot about this place and its rated rather highly.  As such, my expectations were equally as high.  Upon entering the building, my girls oooo-ed and awww-ed - as it is impressive - modernly decorated.  Feels high end.  The restrooms were clean and the theater itself was clean.  The premium upgraded seats looked awesome.  All lined up the 3 seats we paid $72 for - complete with blanket and pillow.  The girls were first to sit and they loved it.  And when I sat down is when all the allure came off.  The premium seats (at least in theater 5) look full and cushiony - but if you are an adult that weighs more than 100lbs, you're going to wind up disappointed.  Almost zero cushion around the back support bar made the 90 minute movie feel like an eternity.  I could not get comfortable - and all seats in our row (row H) seemed to be the same.  To me, it seems the cushions are extremely worn so any adult that is not model perfect is going to be extremely uncomfortable.  Even sitting up I could feel the bar.  

This was my first visit and after shelling out an additional $50 for food which was just 'ok' - I'm not sure we will be returning.  It seemed to me that the AMC Esplanade was 10x more comfortable and didn't charge extra for reclining chairs or require a membership for the discount.

If they could bring the food up to par to feel like it was worth $50 and fix the chairs, then I would have felt like it would have been worth my money.  For now, I just don't see it."}
{"text":"A first class way to go to the movies. I started going to the movies here in early 2012 and have never been back to another theater since! iPic is truly the only way to watch a movie in the theater now."}
{"text":"Warning!  If you choose to watch a movie at iPic, you may be rendered unable to see a movie at a regular movie theater ever again.

Tickets are pricey... in my opinion, if I'm going to be paying that much for a movie anyway, I'm going to go ahead and splurge for the Premium Plus seats (plan ahead... make a reservation).  Arranged in pairs, these seats are ideal for two people to sit together, but a group will work if you don't mind extra space between every two of you.  The reclining chairs are more comfortable than my own couch, and the blanket and pillow threaten to put me to sleep before the Featured Presentation.  

One of the unique things about iPic is the wait service in the theater.  Flag down a server for a drink, appetizer or entree and it will arrive at your seat to be enjoyed on a slide-out tray.  Everything is about comfort, and the experience is well worth the cost of admission.

Hang out in Salt Lounge before your movie, or pair the evening with dinner at Tanzy!  Try the Nitro drinks, they are tasty and very \"cool\"."}
{"text":"Not bad, nice theater. Caters more to
Adults. I took my daughter during the week to see a kids movie, chairs were comfortable and the building clean. I don't think I would take her again, if I'm going to see a movie with my husband I would go there."}
{"text":"Love going here for busy movie openings. I can arrive 5 mins before my movie starts and my seat will be there waiting. Waiters bring you a bag of popcorn and drink and whatever else you want to order. Seats are very comfortable and recline. Also comes with a blanket because it does get cold. A little expensive, about double Harkins each ticket. But worth it to watch movies where you don't want to deal with packed theaters or annoying kids screaming."}
{"text":"If you want an excellent movie experience pick the premium seats!! Very relaxing to watch a movie on a theater screen but it feels like your at home in your comfortable chair!

Also at home no one ever brings me my food & drinks without me have to cook or at least do the dishes!!

Enjoy your movie!!"}
{"text":"First of all, I don't know how all these good reviews can exist.  My experience was a combination of all the bad reviews below.  Starting with the fact that it cost $75 for two \"premium\" seat tickets and two drinks.  That in itself should stop you right here.  We were given a $75 gift card and on arrival paid for our tickets, went to the bar and ordered one drink and one beer, added $1 cash to the card and it was gone.

Quite a while after being seated we ordered another drink and appetizers for our dinner.  (Interestingly, at 7:30 on a Saturday night they were out of their most popular and advertised item on the menu.)   Shortly our drinks were brought to us along with glasses of water.  These \"premium\" seats are like a big upholstered block, with a little tray that swings out in front of you.  My tray was sloped so, since our server never returned, and the condensation on the tray caused the glasses to slide across it, I spent the entire movie juggling glasses.  And because she never took our glasses away, we couldn't move our trays and therefore couldn't move around in the \"premium\" seats to get comfortable.   Also, good luck trying to recline one of these with the tray in front of you full of dirty dishes. 

We watched all the people around us getting served by other waiters and pretty soon the lights went down and the movie started and people were still getting served but ours never returned.  More than halfway through the movie, she appeared and asked if we'd like anything else and I told her no, and I didn't want the food we never got charged to our credit card.  She was shocked (although it was HER job) and she wanted to put the order in then which was ridiculous.  Note too that this setup does not have buttons in the seats to call for service such as at the Esplanade.  When leaving, my husband was asked how everything was and he asked for a manager, who of course apologized and asked for my email address so he could send us two free tickets.  He even repeated what I wrote down so I know he got the correct address.  Well here it is a week and a half later and imagine, no free tickets in the mail.  

Today I called and asked to speak to a manager, before writing this review, and after holding for 10 minutes, the girl came back and said no one was available to talk with me.  I think there is the problem with iPic; no one is ever available.  

Bottom line:  Save a lot of money and go to any Harkins Theater or  the Esplanade dinner theater.  I don't even remember what movie I saw here because I was so busy tending to what they were supposed to be doing.   Big waste of a night and money."}
{"text":"A truly great movie experience. I went yesterday for the first time, and it exceeded my expectations. It looks more like a nice modern lounge as opposed to a movie theatre. Shoot, the bathroom was nicer than half the clubs I've been to. There is a nice bar called Salt connected to the theatre- try the mojito with Malibu!
So here's a few of the perks Ipic has to offer:
-Buy tickets online, and choose where you want to sit.
-Become a member free, and get discounts on tickets and food/drinks.
-If you upgrade your seats you get reclining chairs - pillows and blankets available upon request. Though regular seating was very comfy as well.
-there's a wine vending machine!
-lots of food options.
-they even sell buckets of beer.
Located right smack in the middle of the Q in N. Scottsdale- if your a movie buff definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"This theatre is over priced and overrated. The non-premium seats that don't come with food and beverage service, while being cushioned, don't recline at all and make for a very uncomfortable experience. They were $16 each, hadn't been cleaned, and are too close to the screen. I would rather have been at a \"regular\" theater. The ladies room is HUGE and has bigger seats in there! Who is going to hang out in there?"}
{"text":"Attending the iPic theater is an indulgent experience! You feel like you're in a posh LA hotel; the design is sleek and futuristic. Did I mention the impressive amenities they offer like the soda-fountainesque wine dispenser?

We saw Arthur last night and enjoyed the whole night from beginning to end.  Our server was attentive and informative about what we could expect from him throughout the film. You place your order about 20 minutes before the film starts, you are served 15 minutes in, and the check is dropped another 30-60mins after. Food was good; we ordered Sweet Potato Fries and the Cheesecake dessert. 

Overall, it's not a bad way at all to go if you have the extra dough to splurge on a movie date.  I would go again but probably only for a special occasion--going too often would take the magic away."}
{"text":"Im usually not one for \"high end\" places mostly because i feel they are just a perceived image with no real extra value. BUT this place just makes sense to me. Average cost of a late movie is around $12-14. You get a small, mildly comfy seat but it can be cramped and depending on the movie popularity, it can get crowded. For a few extra dollar, this place gives you a relaxing \"lazy boy\" type chair, a blanket and you can put your feet up without bothering someone else. Plus FREE popcorn with every ticket. That makes up for the extra cost right there. So this is just a no brainer. 
Go here and get the extra comfort and not have to deal with the crowds."}
{"text":"Definitely would go again for something different but not all the time. First, the chairs were amazingly comfortable. Points for that. Second, the food is okay. You don't get free refills on soda (which is ok i guess) and the popcorn is mediocre. We ordered calamari and chocolate cake. The sauce for the calamari was delicious but the chunks of calamari were HUGE and made me feel sick after a few bites. The chocolate cake was good but mostly frosting and VERY rich. It was still fun to order food and they had very impressive options. 

My complaints? While the seats were comfortable the hand rail on the side was annoying. I am a short person so maybe that's why it was in the way of the screen. Just a little section on the left side of the screen had it in view (we sat on the right side of the theatre in the premium seats.) I was just bugged because you'd think that they would have taken that into consideration? Also, I got hit in the head with a blanket when the person in front of me reclined and put his blanket on. 

Overall: A fun experience for maybe a special movie but I'll be going to Harkins on the regular. We will go back but only once or twice a year as ticket prices are spendy!"}
{"text":"Love this place. It's such a fun date spot or even somewhere to go with friends. After watching a movie here you'll never want to go to another movie theater. Their seats are incredibly comfy to the point to where it feels like you're at home. The food is good and they even have service while the movie is going on. Even if you're not seeing a movie the happy hour is pretty good. The bar has a great vibe and has ample outdoor space for when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"worth every penny to watch a movie in comfort, with a cocktail & no threat of interruption by a screaming toddler.  wonderful idea.  it won't replace every movie theater, but this will be our first choice of theater on \"date night\"."}
{"text":"Fantastic customer service! They really went above and beyond and I am impressed. Thanks, Joe!"}
{"text":"I'll never go to a regular theatre again (if I can help it)! FInally, I can watch a movie and enjoy wine in luxury - and I'm not talking about my couch.  I'm surprised it's taken so long for this concept to reach Scottsdale, but am glad to see it's here.  And in the Scottsdale Quarter no less.

I highly recommend going for the \"Gold Class\" seats as opposed to the 'Premium' seats: confusing, but the Premium seats are the basic, and  for only a few dollars more the Gold Class seats come with free popcorn, free valet, AND.... in-theatre service!!!  Not to mention the large couch-like seats electronically recline to a position that can only be described as sitting up in bed; and the kind host will offer you a pillow and blanket. Yes, please!  They serve Salt's full menu, and the wine list is pretty decent.  My friends and I had a wonderful time, the service was excellent, and the food and wine spectacular.  If the movie was bad, I didn't mind. Two-thumbs way up!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Good service, better food and comfortable seating. We sat in the deluxe reserved and had dinner...Caesar salad, Chinese rolls, Maytag blue cheese chips, filet sliders and drinks...

Make it a play night and invite friends to go with...laughed, ate and would have just spent the night - but another show as coming up...oh well next time."}
{"text":"I still enjoy coming here but not as much as I use too. I feel like the service from the servers, has gone way down!!! I had to leave the movie a couple times to get a refill for myself from some other server in the hall or get dips that I asked for and never received. It's happened the last couple times. It's kinda a hit or miss on service... Not sure if worth the price anymore..."}
{"text":"Every movie here has been great!  Sure, it's *NOT* cheap, but its worth it.  This place will literally ruin all of the other movie theaters for you.  It is so nice, clean, and comfortable in there that you won't want to go to another place again!"}
{"text":"The good, the bad and the ugly - - -here it goes:

1.  The good - the seats are much nicer than in a regular movie theatre and the \"gold\" seats definitely are plush with recliners and other amenities (pillows, blankets, popcorn, etc.). If you plan to go to the iPic often, sign up to be a member for better ticket prices and offers.  The pricing for just a movie at a member rates seem fair compared to a regular movie based on the comfort of the seats.  I also liked that they have reserved seats so you know what you are getting when you purchase your tickets.  

2.  The bad:  Because they allow multiple types of food and drinks to be in the theatre - which should be a benefit - it actually makes the movie environment louder and can be more distracting when someone opens up their plastic pizza container, puts their drink down loudly, etc.  

3.  The ugly - we went to the Salt Bar for a drink before the movie.  The cost for 2 drinks was $30 + tip!  Way too expensive for two drinks!!!!!!!  Are you kidding me?

My advice - go for the movie but skip the drinks unless you have cash to spend."}
{"text":"Last weekend was my first trip to IPIC and I really didn't find a reason to return. I agree with a previous review that the seats are an issue. We bought the $16 seats, not the VIP but stillI would expect to be more comfortable than I would be in a regular theatre. I was not.  I couldn't  get comfortable and my low back hurt for three days. 
Also, we spent $43 on food- 2 popcorns, 2 drinks and chicken strips for the kids. The popcorn was so salty I had to go ask for a new bag. The gentleman working in concessions was kind put out by my request and when I asked for butter he quickly added about a teaspoon full and shoved the popcorn at me like I was a total inconvenience. My daughter ate two bites of the chicken and said it was gross. I took a bite and have to agree - slimy and greasy. My son ate the rest all but said they were't good at all. They do get 5 stars for the lemonade and water though. 
I had high hopes for the place but sadly it didn't work out."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go to iPic for a long time and from the outside its just an amazing looking venue. The price is up there and the reviews look great, but sadly my girlfriend and I couldn't get the seats for the movie we wanted and all the others were pretty much sold out too. We searched online last some more for open seating today but no can do. Sorry iPic, its just not in the cards for us."}
{"text":"This has been my third time at iPic and I have to say each time has been great. Although the prices are a little high, the truth is, the food, drink and comfort you get make the whole experience completely worth it. 

The bartenders were friendly and the servers were just fantatic. I can't say enough great things about how good the food was. If you havn't tried it, I would recommend the delux seats for your first experience. If that isn't for you, the normal seats are still super comfortable. Way better than any other theater I have been to."}
{"text":"iPic can be described in one word: LUXURIOUS! Even the bathrooms go above and beyond! 

We sat in the Premium Plus seats, complete with blankets, pillows and reclining chair. The second I sat down i said, \"Why would you ever see a movie any other way?\" (Well probably you would if your dad didn't happen to buy you tickets and a gift card....such as myself)

My sister and I split the brie panini and the lemon chicken satay. Both were delicious! My other sister ordered one of the trios of sliders and loved that too! We also ordered sweet potato fries to split for the 3 of us- there were plenty. For dessert, we did the brownie (huge! delish!) and the creme brulee cheesecake (YUM!). I was stuffed and satified by the end. 

I thought the service was great, but my sisters said they had had better in the past. It would be great for a special date, birthday, or even a bachelorette party. The bar looked like a great place to meet up with friends. Expensive but worth it!"}
{"text":"IPic is the best luxury theatre in the valley. The recliner seats are the largest and most plush that I've experienced. Food service in the theatre is also of high quality. Plus, the pillows and blankets are a nice touch to top it all off. Truly an elite moviegoing experience!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to iPic since they first opened. The place was a dream in the beginning. The only movie theater we would go to but unfortunately the service is slipping and the chairs have become uncomfortable and incredibly dirty. The food is pretty good but we hope that a renovation is in their future."}
{"text":"I took my wife out to a special movie date to pamper her for her \"special\" birthday....she would KILL me if I stated her age.
We arrived early because we were told the theater opens a little early to get settled and drink/food service begin.  We sat and awaited our order to be taken, we noticed a server taking orders around us and I waved him over, he kindly apologized and stated we were not his area but assured us Tatum would be over shortly.  Apparently we have different definitions of shortly...she came around TEN MINUTES later!!  I had told my wife I would go and get us some drinks to tide us over but she told me to relax and wait, which I did, but I really wanted this to be a special night out for her and I felt as though she were missing out.  By the way the other server not only had the other patrons drink out to them but he had taken their food orders!  When Tatum finally made her debut it was just as the screen was to go dark for the upcoming attractions.  The only reason I gave the two stars because the food was very good and the comfort of the theater.  I reached out via email to let them know how our night was and I received an email from Melissa apologizing and letting me know someone would PROMPTLY reach out to me....this was Christmas eve and I am still waiting....again with different versions of what \"promptly\" means.  I was sent a follow up email to let them know how they were doing with their follow up but it went to my spam and when I tried to respond it stated that I could no longer submit it because the case had been closed.  In all reality because of the loving kind of wife I have she said she was very happy with everything I just felt for the kind of money we put out for \"VIP\" service I was left wanting."}
{"text":"Went and checked out the new iPic Theatres at the Scottsdale Quarter tonight for their mock opening. This place is insane...it's like the W Scottsdale mixed with a movie theatre. 

First, the seats. Wow. They are unbelievably plush, and they recline. Each has a swiveling table to place your drink/food on which is served by one of many waiters. You get a blanket or pillow if you wish and a \"free\" popcorn plus valet parking. I say \"free\" because tickets are $25 once they open this Friday.

They are doing free movies and food (sliders, flatbreads, salads) and drinks (cocktails, beers, wine) Monday and Tuesday but you have to make reservations. Seriously check it out."}
{"text":"Tatum made our first experience at this theatre awesome . Definitely good drinks and service ! The they're itself is very cozy and everything all around was a good experience !!"}
{"text":"Great service & good food! Would like more premium seats because they are typically sold out a day or two before the movie showing."}
{"text":"Finding a good dine in theatre is hard to come by. My dad kept ranting and raving about iPic so I finally decided to indulge for Valentine's day. 

The theatre is definitely Scottsdale worthy - beautiful, glamorous, with food and a full bar. We got the premium seats which fully reclined (think of Lazy Boy style), had a blanket per seat, and free popcorn. This came at $27 a ticket. I would not come here just for any old time but for a special occasion it was quite the treat.

Pros- extremely comfortable seats, beautiful entrance, good food and drink options.

Cons- service was extremely slow, next time I would get my food and drinks myself. There is no call button so it's difficult to get the servers attention. Steep price."}
{"text":"Who needs to watch a movie like your flying first class? Nobody does, but for those who wants too - there's and establishment for that. First off, their Salt Lounge is baronial. There is quite a few places in the greater Phoenix area where you can have a drink before/at the movies, but none as classy as this. I mean the concept has been taken far beyond the \"going to the movies\" experience. Kudos to whomever came up with this. 

Disregarding the drink connoisseur in me - and review the movie experience. 

I will disregard the movie in itself, and also the fact that it was a 3D movie.. because I don't like 3D movies. But the seats are comfy, very comfy.. and you have a little table to yourself.. and it is a pampering experience. I love that everybody that works here is dressed nicely in a uniform way, and act very appropriate. So service plays its part, but when it all is broken down it's still going to the movies. Not even iPic theatres can make me enjoy Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnsons acting attempts. (How does he weasel his way into every franchise, Sam L Jackson style? But I digress..)

The difference is, I guess, that if you are going on (trying to impress) a date, and willing to pony up the difference - yes, this is the way to go to the movies. No doubt. Pre-drinks and comfort - Hell yes. The restaurant looks absolutely stellar, but I haven't tried it. It has that Scottsdale-posh vibe that usually makes me a bit uncomfortable.

*** I don't know this, but I have a feeling due to the location, the added price and the establishment itself.. this could be the place where I can count on not having crying babies in the atrium like I seem to always have everywhere else. And I would pay extra for that. ***

Uncomfortable seats in the 'premium' area -- you serve yourself (order then have to go leave the theater to get your food-- all the serving trays to carry multiple dishes back for me and my teen kids were really dirty- and staff looked at me cross-eyed when I asked where the clean trays were!! What the heck?!) Staff also seemed disorganized - were talking and cursing by the food pickup area. food was mediocre at best!! Staff was really unprofessional if not borderline rude. I expected a LOT more for the money!! Don't waste yours!! Haskins 101 and desert ridge AMC offer better everything for a fraction of the cost!! rip off!"}
{"text":"Is it worth $25 for a reclining seat, and a wait staff with  no call button? I don't know, but I keep coming back, because I like not having to fight my way over a row of screaming children and their plebeian parents just to get a darn cocktail! Waiter!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my self at IPic when i went! i had heard from a few friends that i got to check it out! I was impressed with everything but the price! It was really expensive i paid $25 dollars for a movie just for my self! But it was really fun! It was nice being able to pick our seats online and know where we are going to sit even before we get there! The Seats where out of this world! i felt like i was on my lazy boy back at my house! it was cool having a server you are defiantly pampered there.....for a fee! I really enjoyed my self there, i would love to go there more often but it is really expense! i would defiantly go more if the prices where a little bit lower!"}
{"text":"Beautiful place in a lovely setting. Although quite dark inside the entire lobby and bar area, we were able to locate our special event. We sampled appetizers, entrees and drinks prior to watching a film. Unfortunately I experienced some type of food poisoning the same night through the following day which was quite unpleasant  None of my immediate friends had the salmon so they didn't experience what I did, but I'm sure it was the food and I believe it sat too long in the kitchen before being placed out for our event. It was awful and I would hesitate to recommend dining here due to my experience. The theater chairs and amenities were very nice and comfortable."}
{"text":"Most relaxing and new way to watch in theatre movies. Beer mixed drinks appetizers and food served continually thru out the move . Great experience"}
{"text":"Love relaxing in the recliner couches with blankets and being served. This iPic is also in a great location, close to shopping and dinning."}
{"text":"Love iPic,  just a little pricey for watching a movie. Definitely a special occasion kind of night."}
{"text":"Get the premium reclining seats don't get the regular one! I used to get the regular one and they are actually less comfortable than those you can get at regular Harkin theaters.  What's the point of paying double when u can get better seat at a regular theater? Go for the more expensive premium seat if u want to come to ipic!"}
{"text":"I will never see a movie any other way. This place is going to put cinema supper club out of business. 

Food:  From Tanza - excellent. The trick is to get there 20 minutes early so you get your food early and you're not eating in the day.  I've been here a few times now, and I haven't any complaints.  Even the wait-staff is incredibly friendly. 

Alcohol:  There is an awesome wine dispenser. How very 2012.  But there's also a bar that serves to ipic - it's called \"Salt\".  I would like to recommend the el-corazon - unsalted. 2 of those, and I was ready to make out with my husband in the theater. 

The seats:   It's so worth is to sit in the VIP seating. Seats recline, you get a pillow, and super-soft blanket, and UNLIMITED popcorn. Really?  I'm moving in. 

Become a member and tuesdays are discount days. Membership is FREE."}
{"text":"This theater is everything I could ever want in a cinematic viewing slice of heaven.   We're talking new movies with great food in a nice recliner plus alcohol and full service. 
The facilities are that of a 5 star restaurant.  The bathrooms are so clean that you could eat off of the floors! The theater seating is spaced out for comfort, with small tables build into the recliners to achieve maximum convenience during the movie. 
The staff was more than helpful in seating and serving plus making us feel welcome.  Service during the movie was very discrete, courteous and non-disruptive. 
The food was excellent! Slider appetizers followed by a buffalo shrimp flat-bread really hit the spot. The cheesecake dessert really brought the whole night together as a wonderful experience that everyone should have at least once in their lives. 
Complete with the convenience of online seat reservation/payment, it doesn't get any better than this!
This is the perfect place for a date or simply a night out to pamper yourself."}
{"text":"Love the concept. We got premier seats and they were so comfy but the food (miniature nachos) was terrible. Stick with the drinks and popcorn!"}
{"text":"We went for a flick on Christmas Eve and what a nice experience.  The food was delicious (buffalo chicken rolls, super-good flatbreads, delicious truffle fries, yummy cheesecake) and the seats were better than home!  We booked ahead and reserved the recliners because not only are they comfortable but they have little blankets and pillows there for one's use.  The servers are very attentive and do a really good job, considering they have to go up and down the stairs a gazillion times.  They even brewed us fresh decaf which made the experience even better because we were able to sip coffee (good coffee) as we watched the movie.  I highly recommend this theatre.  Also, don't forget about the free (except for the tip, of course) valet parking.  Very handy!"}
{"text":"Ok this place is nice I wont dispute that and I expected it to be expensive but $98.00 for two adults and three kids to see an afternoon kids show almost pissed me off and set the stage for a bad experience.  The next issue is the food I was not impressed at all and when your charging me steak prices for sliders don't give me microwave burgers with no fries and the smallest sliders I've ever seen.  The place looks nice but so does the Studio Grill just down the road at half the price and much better food.  I may bring my wife here for an evening show to give them another chance but all in all very unimpressed with the experience.  Seats and ambiance is nice."}
{"text":"We used to love this place.... it's amazing you get a comfy seat and cocktail!! But now they've changed the menu and it's so bad we won't eat while we watch the movie anymore and unless they clean their seats (because they are filthy, broken and smelly now) I won't go back! Their service has also gone down the tube, we've had managers give us free tickets because we had to go out every time we needed a drink or condiment. 
The carpet also looks shitty. They would have a cool drink and recipe every month and now they have crappy food like grilled cheese.... what am I 5? Anyway don't go there! If we refuse to sit in filthy seats maybe they will replace them!"}
{"text":"I WANT to love iPic.  This weekend marked the fourth time I've visited this theater and the second time I paid for the premium seats.  Honestly, I really want to say this place is top notch and I can't wait to go back, but this last time confirmed the fact I need to take a break from iPic and \"dinner and a movie\" places in general.  Let me start off by saying I see a lot of movies and lately I've been frequenting the dinner and a movie places (iPic and Esplanade) more and more.

My first couple experiences at iPic were in the \"regular seats.\"  These seats have the advantage of being chosen in advance, but do not come with any frills.  The seats are larger than normal and mostly comfortable, but do not recline at all.  I don't hate them and probably would consider coming back and sitting in one of these options.

The last two times at iPic we've splurged for the \"premium\" seats.  The first time we arrived a few minutes before the previews and our waiter took forever to come back to take our order, so we didn't get to do so until after the movie started.  This was very distracting and really makes you not able to pay attention to the movie.  The food was ok... had the buffalo spring rolls, margarita flatbread, and meatball sliders.  Nothing that wow'd me, but not bad.  The seats were OK... we were in the row before the non-premium seats and I'm short, but for a tall person your feet would be hitting the wall... not too comfy.  I also felt like the chair itself was a bit worn... not as fluffy and cushy as one would expect.

Finally, this last weekend broke the straw.  We arrived early this time in order to get our order in on time... in fact we were the first in the theater.  Our waiter was prompt (I think it was the same guy from the last time) and took our drink and food order quickly.  This time our seats were really dirty and had popcorn in the cracks.  The whole place felt a bit grimy, big turn-off.  The worst part of all is EVERYONE in the theater got their food before us.  They lost our ticket and didn't put our entree order in!  45 minutes into the movie my Husband had to leave the theater and track down our waiter.  He ended up covering our food, but we missed half of the movie because we were distracted due to our missing food (and we were starving).  When the food did come it wasn't good... the coconut shrimp had a weird taste and the pizza and odd, unexpected frozen-like sausage.

Just a disappointment.  I don't know if I'll go back anytime soon and sit in the premium seats at iPic.  They really need to work on the service and cleanliness in the theaters.  Maybe after a break I'll be back... we'll see..."}
{"text":"Where else can you drink beer in a leather lounge chair and watch a movie!!?? It's awesome!"}
{"text":"If you are looking to see a movie and have a night out...go to iPic!  My favorite place to see a movie!  Pay for the more expensive ticket at it includes valet parking and popcorn - you add that to the price of the lower ticket, and you have the same price in tickets.

A truly FANTASTIC movie experience!!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this theater since it opened in 2009. Food and service have always been consistently very good! The premium plus seats, however, could use some updating.  Some are flimsy. Some have holes in them. It would be great if they were leather...Like the seats at the West Chester, PA location! Recently, we heard that the blankets and pillows were washed every few days. Yikes! Otherwise, overall great experience. Highly recommend paying the extra for Premium Plus seats. While you're at it, it pays to be a member of their Sapphire Club! Special Advanced screenings are awesome!"}
{"text":"I just love this place! It is the most awesome movie going experience! The food is always wonderful. I am partial to the Turkey Sliders, Sweet Potato Fries & the Chinous Chicken Salad Rolls. My husband & children love the Beef Sliders, Truffle Fries & Flatbread Pizzas. Our service is consistently outstanding!Definitely try it out!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go!  The VIP seating is well worth the money.  The food is AMAZING!!!  Great place to bring visitors from out of town.... blows them away!!!"}
{"text":"Nicest movie theater I've ever been to. I've gone to other dine in theaters but this one takes the cake ... There are two bars before you even go into the theaters. There are also wine dispensers to do a little wine tasting. I didn't try the food bc I had eaten breakfast shortly before arriving but it looked and smelled delicious!!! Theater was clean and the staff was extremely friendly!"}
{"text":"\"Yay! I'm a fan\" is a pretty spot on description of iPic. I'm a fan. I can't be a regular because it's so dang expensive but I could never forget about it because the two times I've been there I've had a great time. The food is pretty good but since you're in an expensive movie theater, don't expect the food to be cheap.

I'm still not sure how I feel about having servers during a movie, it's a bit of a nuisance so I would suggest that you don't go see a movie you REALLY want to see because it's likely to be interrupted every now and then.

Overall it's an incredible movie-going experience because there isn't anything like it. iPic is one of a kid and if I could see movies there for the rest of my life at the same price as other theaters I wouldn't hesitate on that opportunity."}
{"text":"So comfy. The food was good, and the staff is friendly. The free popcorn made my day. I would definitely do this again."}
{"text":"I've never felt so spoiled watching a movie!

iPic is a gorgeous venue.
You reserve your seats ahead of time, so you don't need to arrive early to get good ones.  Just arrive, grab a drink at the bar and/or order some food.  It's all delicious.

They provide blankets and popcorn, and even better, the seats recline.  
It was wonderful.

The only thing I didn't like too much is how often the server came by.
At Studio Movie Grill they have a button you can push if you need something.  Otherwise they leave you alone.  I think iPic should do this, too."}
{"text":"I love the experience and have a good time. The service can be spotty but it has been better recently.  It's good to be a member if you go for cheaper seats."}
{"text":"I only go to IPic now. It's ruined me for other movies. You can't go wrong with food, alcohol, blanket, pillow and free popcorn in a big comfy chair. What more do you need!"}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed in the show of customer service tonight. My boyfriend, brother and I tried using a gift card in order to come to the show tonight, for the amount of $75, well over the cost of our movie which was $36. As soon as we walked in the door a nice young woman greeted us and asked if we were purchasing our tickets or picking them up, and we were purchasing so we went to the front of the register. That's when things went down hill, for some reason the card we were using was saying it was \"expired\" which the girl explained doesn't happen and she's never seen a card do. 

After a couple of minutes she calls her manager over, and this is when I expected the problem to get taken care of, the manager would take care of us. To no avail, the manager had never seen such a thing either and asked if my brother had a receipt, for the gift card. He did but it was at home, but even if he had not had the receipt, that shouldn't have been an issue. The manager then continued to say that there was nothing he could do unless we were able to bring the receipt to him. As we were already there and the movie was going to be starting soon, we just paid cash because we did not want to miss the start of the film because of this issue. 

I work in the service industry, I know how a guest should be taken care of and this is not it. They offered apologies but had no solution to our issue in that moment. If we had not brought other methods to pay we would not have been able to watch the film and the nights plans would have had to have been cancelled. At the very least I was expecting some sort of offer to reimburse us for tonight's payment if we were to bring the receipt in, but was given no such offer.  

The movie was good and we enjoyed our time from then on out. The two gentlemen at the concession stands were very friendly and professional. Bathrooms were very nice and well kept as was the entire theater. I just was hoping for more of an effort from the manager to fix an issue or wrongdoing that was not our fault."}
{"text":"Pretty amazing seats except if you're too far forward you can't sit comfortably because they don't recline.  I hate that you have to choose what seats based on the service I've been to other places similar venues don't have that stupid choice, thus prefer them over this place. It should be all or nothing but the venue is pretty and the cocktails are delicious!"}
{"text":"This is concerning a visit on 11/26/15.

I understand that working on a holiday might not be everyones first choice, however, the patrons are paying the same money regardless of if your employees want to be there or not.

My girlfriend and I experiences horrible service when we went to an earlier showing of the Hunger Games movie.  Started off when my girlfriend asked if they had any type of breakfast options (and only asked because the menu didn't seem to have anything listed and we figured if they were open for a 9AM movie, they might have some breakfast options). We were told there wasn't any type of breakfast offerings and then placed our order of quesadillas.

After about 10 minutes, a different server approached the people seated in front of us and was also asked about breakfast and while he said there wasn't much did mention that they had breakfast burritos (which quite honestly was exactly what we were looking for).  This is more than frustrating when you are paying the prices that Ipic charges.

Through out the movie, our server came in to check on us but apparently he missed the day when they taught them how to stay out of the patrons way and speak in a voice that wouldn't disturb the entire theater.  Every time he came in he spoke in a voice as if there wasn't a movie going on.  

Lastly, while the blankets and pillows are a nice touch, I'd caution you on staying till the lights come on.  Lets just say the seats don't appear as if they've ever been cleaned, the blankets are likely the same ones from when they opened, and if you drop something in the chair... leave it there because the popcorn and other crap you'll have to dig through is disgusting.  You'd think being that it was the first show of the day that they would have cleaned the night before.

Not worth the money based on this visit."}
{"text":"I have always loved going to the movies.

But since they started dinner theaters, this is my ideal entertainment.  You walk in, sit down, pull up a table, and order drinks and food. 

With a young child, I can feed her, while enjoying the movie. Most times, if I order just right, I can keep her eating throughout the movie.
Generally we attend the Studio Movie Grill on Hayden, but recently a friend suggested trying iPic at Scottsdale Quarter.

I booked (always a good idea)
Chose the upgraded seating.

Imagine my surprise when I showed up at the theatre, and find I need to order and wait for my food \"outside\" and then carry it into the theatre.

What? I cannot sit down and order from inside the theatre?
Nope, thats only for the upgraded seats.
Mmm, I thought I had done that. But no, there are three (?) levels of seating.

So my family and I order, and wait for our food. In the meantime the movie starts. Did I mention the food was substantially more expensive than anywhere else, but of course this is the \"Quarter\".

The movie was great, and the seats comfortable, but I wont be back. 
And yes, I told my friend he needs to look into other places."}
{"text":"Our first time here and we loved it! The young man at the concession stand was very nice and friendly! The place was clean and the seats in the movie room are spacious and super comfortable! 
I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is not as awesome as I was lead to believe.  The menu is \"meh\".  So is the food.  Also- you have to get online ahead of time & reserve the \"good\" seats.  If you're in a regular seat you have to order food at a counter & wait for your buzzer to go off & then get up to retrieve your order.  Since a lot of orders go in at one time (before the movie starts) it takes a while... So you end up getting up after the movie started & you miss part of it.  If you want drinks... Forget it!  You'll be up & down the whole movie.  
Then your plates just sit there the whole rest of the show- not very relaxing.  The person next to you is right on top of you too.  
I went to another dinner & movie theatre where you have a waiter the entire time & a much bigger menu.  It was way better!"}
{"text":"We came here to avoid the scorching hot sun and to stay in the cool air conditioned environment. Talk about a plush theater experience!! The seats were assigned seats. There were two different pricing: $12 & $18/seat. The $18 seat offers option of being able to order food, drinks, snacks, alcoholic beverages, etc from the seat, and they will deliver. 

We opted for the lesser seats, and each seat was with real leather and were very plush. The seats were too soft and sunk in bit much to a point where by the end of the movie, our backs didn't feel so well, so we had to stretch to feel better again. 

The ladies restrooms were incredibly well put together. It seemed more like a waiting area at a fancy shmancy pricy salon. Not sure all this fanciness was necessary in a bathroom. Very nice though."}
{"text":"Well I really like this place.  So why only three stars?  Well my food was cold.  I ordered meatball sliders and they were really cold when i got them.  Too bad too or else I would have rated this between a 4 and 5 star place.  Other than that, service was great.  Theater is wonderful!  Sat in the premium seats. Awesome way to watch a movie.  The seats recline electrically and they give you a blanket.  Compared to the other place over on 24th and Camelback, this place has a little more of an edge.  I do like the call button at the other place a little better but service here was good enough it was not needed.  I will go back and hopefully food will be better next time.  The other thing is food is kinda pricey."}
{"text":"I was hoping to love iPic, and gave it a few tries but...plain and simple, it's just an overpriced rip off.  The regular seats are fairly uncomfortable. The Premium seats do recline and you only have to pay $25 a ticket for them WHICH IS RIDICULOUS when you compare them to the newly opened Harkins Camelview.  The Harkins Camelview is BEAUTIFUL.  Big leather seats that recline farther than iPic Premium seats and they are HALF THE PRICE.
The food at iPic is mediocre at best and WAY OVERPRICED.
I guess they think they cater to the elite because they serve wine and overprice everything.
Money was not the issue for me but value and comfort is and iPic is a complete waste of time and money in my opinion.
The small theaters at iPic do not compare at all to the new Harkins Camelview theaters at Fashion Mall.  Camelview has very big theaters with huge isles so each seat can fully recline and people can easily walk in front of you to get to their seats.  The screens at iPic don't compare in size to the Camelview.
And, ALL THE SEAT ARE HUGE AT CAMELVIEW and they ARE ALL PREMIUM but they do not charge the ridiculous prices for their seats that iPic charges to be in their premium section.
iPic tries to make you think that you are in \"first class\" because you are paying premium prices.  Camelview is first class because it is a beautifully designed theater and they are not overcharging their customers for the experience.
iPic is just a rip off and Camelview is truly one of the best theaters I have ever been in.
I will never waste another minute or dollar at iPic."}
{"text":"I love ipic. I come to iPic basically for any movie that comes out I want to see. I rather skip a movie then go to amc or harkins now that ipic is around. 
Go for the premium plus seats. For a little more cost you get a server, free popcorn, blanket, pillow and reclining seats! If you want the lower seats they're ok, it's nice though cause you can still order food n drinks you just have to go get them yourself. 
The service is usually pretty good here. There's been a couple times where the service sucks but I've overcome that because I come for the movie not just service. Plus, I've had more good experiences than bad so I keep coming. 
Make sure you sign up for the rewards. If you're going to come a few times it's worth it because you get discounted seats and earn points. I'm a gold member and it definitely has its perks! 
Keep it up ipic you won me for life!"}
{"text":"This place kicks ass.

The expression \"You get what you pay for\" comes to mind here. This place is not cheap, but you are also in the most comfortable environment to see a movie ever. 

To start with, with the best level of seating, you get free valet parking service. Easy to park, just pull up to the curb and you're on your way. Next you head up the escalator and enter the expansive theater. The hostess greeted us warmly, and since I already ordered and paid for our seats, she directed us to the correct theater.

Long story short, the theater, and all the venue are incredibly upscale and comfortable. Just a really well done place, you feel like you're on vacation.

A few random observations:

- As others have noted, the popcorn is really average to plain. Not sure if that is designed to get you to order something else, but it's weird that the place is so rad, but the popcorn isn't as good as the Target Store snack bar.

- Our seats actually had a partial obstruction. Due to the height of the handrails, you can't see part of the screen (we were on the upper level, far left). I am 6'4, so if I can't see over it, the other 80% of the population must be too. Not sure if that's something they can or will address, but I wouldn't pick the same seats.

-It would be really nice if there were a button that you could hit to request help from the wait staff. AMC has it, and it's a nice touch.

Overall, I highly recommend this place. Very comfy and luxurious and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Wow!  I've never been to one of these!  This place is epic.  Restaurant, bar and movie theater combined.  Reserve the premium plus chairs and enjoy drinks and food throughout the movie!"}
{"text":"Ipic is such a wonderful place to go see a movie! It truly is such a unique experience. The food and drinks are amazing. Try the crispy tuna, filet sliders and the caesar salad. So yummy. If you want to splurge sit in the premium seats to get food and beverage delivered right to your seat. They just remodeled and the seats are even more comfy complete with a pillow and blanket."}
{"text":"This place was very wonderful when it first opened. It was such a a great concept and people were willing to pay to go here. I loved it so much. Now I feel like it has definitely gone downhill. Multiple times I have been here I've had to change seats due to crusted on food and grease on the seats and table. I've seen staff re-fold used blankets after the movie was over. It grosses me out they don't wash them after every use. How can that be okay? They claim they are laundered \"daily\" not per person. Ew. We will no longer pay extra $$$ to go here, as AMC has reclining seats that are leather and can be easily wiped. Those suede seats at the ipic have seen better days and are probably full of germs and bacteria. There like a huge suede napkin in a dark restaurant. They try to have trendy food and drink items  but tons of other places are now doing this too. The food is pretty average nothing life changing. It's not a place I want to go to for a date night anymore. I loved it at first and would tell everyone about it. Now I question their cleanliness and luxury due to multiple poor experiences. I won't be back. It's sad because I loved seeing movies here in the beginning. Now it's just nasty."}
{"text":"I have to say I was not impressed at all. There are other options if you are looking for leather seats and chair side service.
Their pricing for movie tickets is reflective of their location. $64.00 just to watch a movie is ridiculous, oh and that doesn't include any chair side service, those seats are additional.
It's not that I'm cheap, I have no issue spending money on a good night out, however for half the price (and in theater service) I would prefer going a couple of blocks away and then driving over to hit Tanzy afterwards.
The value versus the cost is just not there at iPic. Reduce your ticket costs, provide an unmatchable service experience and you could increase your profits significantly."}
{"text":"Really love this theater!  I just saw The Nutcracker Ballet and Breaking Dawn: Part 2 and it was great both times.  The food and service is always great and I love how comfortable the seats are.  No other theater compares!  A new flatbread was added, the Firecracker Shrimp, and it's my new favorite!!  I'll definitely be back very soon!"}
{"text":"When you want a real movie experience outside the home, the best choice is iPic!  
Plush seating, pillow, blanket, reclining chair, drinks and food ordered to your seats. 
Doesn't get better than this folks! Take a date or the Hubcap, you won't be disappointed!

The staff and management at iPic is superior as well!"}
{"text":"Awsome theater. Staff are extremely rude. Overall a 4 star. Nice restaurant to eat in, recliner sofas, waitress style movie eating.
I recommend upgrading to the gold class for seating. Not a lot of seats kind of small for a theater but definitely a cool place to check out."}
{"text":"We went to see Maleficent this past weekend and although the movie was good I am not so sure $25 per ticket was worth it. The seats were full off stains, the blankets smelled as if they hadn't been washed in weeks, and the tables do not come out far enough so that you aren't covered in food and crumbs... not sexy for a date night. I was fortunate enough to have enough crumbs down my shirt for a snack later.... um, kinda gross. I must say I was a little worried that I couldn't see my food at all so I was a little freaked that I didn't know if there was a hair in it or not but overall the food tasted good. 

I feel there should be a call button so that you can summon the waitress. My burgers were to come with a thousand island sauce however I asked that it be replaced with ketchup. That didn't happen which meant I had a dry hamburger and no way to call her to fix it. By the time someone came to ask if we needed anything else, the food was already cold. 

The apple martini was tasty and the wine bar in the lobby was cool. 

Total cost for the night: 

$50 on tix
$80 on food

Pretty pricey for dirty seats. 

I don't think I'll be rushing back. I'm going to try out the rest of the fancy movie theaters before I say I'll never be back but trust I won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"This was by far one of the best experiences Ive had that movies. I was staying in an extended stay close to Scottsdale quarter and came across this place.  Loved the nightclub like atmosphere, premium seats, and full service.  A little pricey but you're paying for the experience.  This is not necessarily where' I'd take a group of kiddos, but definitely for a date or a group of friends."}
{"text":"i love this place!

after viewing films here, don't know how i'll be able to return to regular theaters!

the premium seats (automated recliners) are super comfortable! the food and beverage service is quick and easy.

you get free popcorn and a blanket and pillow too!"}
{"text":"I love this concept so with high expectations, I booked two movies in two days.  (The Hobbit and Les Miserables).  Purchased premium plus and from the moment you walk in its a \"wow\" experience.  Everything was exceptional so why the 1 star?  Terrible customer service after $100 in fradulent charges were made to my credit card.... All generated from ipic theatres.  To add insult to injury no response from management, after attempts to resolve this, other than \"manager is busy and will have to call you back.\".  It's been 48hours since I reported the erroneous charges and no response!  They missed an opportunity to have a loyal customer as I was prepared to never go anywhere else again for my movie experience.  Others here have reported erroneous charges as well, so they obviously have issues here."}
{"text":"This place is fancy as hell! It feels like a big upgrade from the now defunct Farelli's and FilmBar since those were my previous experiences with food and film before this.
I love the arranged seating. 
I love the fact that I can see new releases of major films here. If you go at the right time (during the day) and look at seating beforehand, you can get a theater all to yourself which is really nice. Drinking and talking through a movie in a public place is fun when there are no taboos. 
The only real downside is that it's fairly expensive for what you're getting. The food isn't anything amazing, but maybe it's more expensive because we're already watching a movie which we paid more than we'd normally pay to see? Hmm. Free popcorn is hardly free if you're already paying a lot to get in. 
I'd go again, but I try to ask for gift cards here rather than pay my way, honestly."}
{"text":"What a difference a couple years makes. My first visit to ipic was amazing! Of course we upgraded to the premium seats. Food was amazing and the service was awesome as well. Fast forward to yesterday. My family and I went to enjoy a movie (again in the premium seats). The arms of the seats are stained and filthy! I understand it's from wear but if your going to have \"premium\" seating you have to clean the suede seats! And finding out the blankets are not changed each time...yuck! I don't know if we will be returning. I'm thinking just stick to Harkins!"}
{"text":"We have been to two events here: Rogue One and Guardians of the Galaxy vol.2. Both have been incredible. The food and service are top notch. And the movie experience, screen, projector, sounds and popcorn are as good as it gets. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Okay, so I just went today for the 1st time. I'm kicking myself that I haven't gone before. Don't overthink this one - just sign up for a membership online (it's free) and book your seats and go! It's a great experience. The place is very nice. The seats are comfy and the pillow and blanket make you want to stay and take a nap after the show is over. Wine carousel is really cool.

Two things would make this a 5 star experience:

1.Hot butter on the popcorn. Not sure if they have this (how can you not?) but your server will bring you popcorn and while hot and fresh, ours had no butter. She didn't ask either. If I'm at the theatre I want butter on my popcorn.

2. The architect screwed up and the handrails on the aisle  (in the shape of a P) block some of your view when reclining. These need to be removed. I mean they have handicapped seating below. No one needs theses rails and while mine only slightly was in the \"field of view\" it really annoyed me!"}
{"text":"This is the most excellent theatre experience ever.  Since we started going here, we have stopped going anywhere else.  The reclining seats are so comfortable with the pillow/blanket, the food is really good, and you have access to a full bar.  I go with my bf a lot, and my kids love it too.  This place is fabulous and changes the movie experience completely for the better :)

I have to say I find it funny when people compare iPic to Studio Movie Grill.  That's like comparing Mastros to McDonalds, or Michael Jordan to anyone else.  iPic is in a whole different league."}
{"text":"Put your feet up and enjoy a movie. That was the initial appeal for me to want to try this place out. The convenience of being able to combine having dinner there and watch a movie was even better. Especially since many times my husband and I don't have a lot of time to hit up dinner and then a movie because of a sitter or just the fact that we go to bed early these days. 
After reading some reviews on Yelp and talking to a friend who went to iPic, we decided to try it out for our anniversary night out. First thing you need to do is sign up for a free membership to get a few dollar discount on the booking. If you go to the movies at the last minute, this may not be for you. I booked two gold tickets and movie time at noon on a Monday and about 30% of the seats were already reserved. You get to pick your seats, which is nice, though once we got there, it seemed most any seat was a good seat. Lots of space. I'm not sure why someone would buy a standard seat without the waiter service. For a non-member, it is $17.50. For a member, it is $14. If you get the gold service, you get a server, free popcorn, a blanket, pillow and reclining, soft chair for $17.50 if you are a member and $25 for a non-member. Bascially, you get a nice big chair, a server and comforts of home for an extra $7 over a regular movie seat at a regular movie theater. Oh, you also get free valet if you do gold service too.
OK, so we booked two gold seats and printed up the sheet and drove to Scottsdale Quarter. As we walked up the stairs to the theaters, we noticed there was a bar called \"Salt\" and a restaurant lounge area called \"Tanzy.\" in between were the doors to the theaters. We didn't know exactly what to do first, as we arrived about 40 minutes prior to the movie. The gal at the hostess stand gave us a basic rundown of what we could do. Eat, drink, or walk around until about 15 mins prior to movie. We decided to have an appetizer at Tanzy. We sat at the bar and chit chatted with the bartender. I wanted to have a fruity, non-alcoholic drink and she came up with a fantastic one called the \"El Corozon.\" It was created by their master bartender and had a mix of blood orange, pomegranate, other juices and she made it into a press with soda water. SUPER DELISH. Loved it. There is also a tequilla version of this in a martini glass with a salt rim. Not as good. 
We ordered the fresh mozzarella and it was good.
After we ate, we went to find our seats at the theater. There wasn't much direction on where to go or how to get to our seats. When we approached the guy who takes your tickets, we handed him our printout from home. He told us we had to print up our tickets so we went to a kiosk and got the \"real\" tickets. As we returned to the ticket taker, no one was at the stand. We stood there and a busser walked past and asked if we needed help. We said we needed to go to our seats. He just said, \"ok, you're down there.\" We started to walk in the direction he pointed at and the ticket taker reappeared. He asked to see our tickets and torn off part of them and told us to go to theater 6. As we walked into the theater, one of the servers was there to direct us to our seats. But, the ticket taker had torn off one of our tickets so the guy thought we had one seat, not two. We told him that the other side was torn off by the ticket taker. He said \"Ok\" and let us up to our seats. 
As we made ourselves comfortable, our server came up and introduced himself and explained the concept. They only had one menu for each group/couple to share. I guess they were low on menus? Later, he came back and took our order. We got a chinese spring roll, angus bacon and cheese sliders and oreo cookie ice cream bars for dessert. My husband had a beer. Popcorn was passed out by someone else. No blanket or pillow yet. It was cool in there. As the movie started, our food came. It was a nice serving of food and on white glass plates. The spring roll was delish, but no sauce. I had to wait a while for our server to come back to ask for sauce to dip it in. The sliders were tasty. It was a bit strange to be eating in a semi-reclined position. I dripped food on my blouse a few times. The desserts were yummy. By the end of the movie, I was completely stuffed. 
All in all, it was a fun first experience. Though, I was disappointed in the confusion for first timers. Also, no pillow or blanket. I wanted to really snuggle up and watch the movie. If I was going to see a movie that really needed my attention, not a fluffy piece like \"No Strings Attached\" I wouldn't choose a dine-in theater. Its also not cheap to go there, but I get the convenience and comfort aspect. 
We will return again...maybe not order as much food and just lay back and enjoy our movie..."}
{"text":"We splurged and went to iPic for the midnight showing of Happy Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 (it's ok to be jealous.) We had never been there before and while we have visited similar theaters in other cities, we didn't quite know what to expect from iPic. From start to finish, this was a wonderful experience. So wonderful that I think I am ruined for regular movie theaters. 

We bought the upgraded seats which are comfy recliners that come with a blanket, pillow and your very own popcorn. The wait staff was very helpful and although we didn't order food, our drinks came out very quickly. It is a bit costly...at $25 for one of these seats it is not something we will be doing every weekend. But for a special night out or a midnight premier (you don't have to wait in line as your seats are reserved) this is a great option! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I had the BEST experience at ipics movie theaters over this weekend! I had family come in from out of town we were reserving seats and for a first timer this was a little rough for me. I called in and the girl over the phone was extremely pleasant she helped to find us seats that would accommodate our party. I purchased two premium seats for my teenage niece and daughter. I wanted them to really enjoy the experience. I was afraid that the server would not be as attentive to them since they were younger and seated away from us, however the server Jullian was super sweet and professional. The girls said that he brought their food and kept their drinks refilled the whole movie. I was so pleased by this I really wanted them to get the full experience!!!! I WOULD CERTAINLY RECOMMEND IPICS TO FRIENDS AND FAMILY!!! The food was great and all the staff super helpful and friendly. The movie quality was fantastic . AND THE BATHROOMS ARE BEAUTIFUL."}
{"text":"This was my first time at an establishment like this, and I will say it's definitely a new experience!  It was really nice to eat and have servers, serving you, while your watching a movie. It was a little hard to find the building, I didnt see a big sign outside anywhere, but it's findable. Overall, great place and great service, I definitely will return."}
{"text":"Went there last night to theatre 6 and sat in H4 I had to sit on 2 pillows and the blanket the springs were so sunk in very work out seat. Drinks used to come in real glasses now they come in huge ugly plastic cups with lids. The food was amazing as always just seems the actual theatre is cheating out on seats and customer service. Coke here all the time hoping next time it's better."}
{"text":"My husband and I were very excited to go to Ipic for our prevalentine day date. The online purchase was simple and passbook on my iPhone worked perfectly. We arrived a little early and we were greeted by very friendly staff. They explained the venue as we were first timers. In the theatre we were pleased with our seats and our waiter was prompt. After taking our order and food being delivered we were not approached again. I had ordered a diet coke after my glass of wine that never came. My husband never got a refill of his tea. We were never asked about dessert which we had planned on ordering. The movie was great and the ipic is very comfortable. May return for a movie but will skip the dining experience as it fell a little flat."}
{"text":"ZERO STARS!

This is our screen at the height of the scene

I wouldn't recommend this place.   Other cinemas offer alcohol drinks without the high price and the movie doesn't fail."}
{"text":"Hubby and I were looking for a time-killer while in Phoenix for a friend's wedding this weekend.  We were pointed to the iPic with glowing recommendations, so decided to catch a movie.

Wow.

We are from LA, land of movies, so you'd think we'd have access to the finest in movie-going experiences out there, but the iPic blew it all out of the water.  Beyond the stuff everyone else is talking about (huge, comfy recliners, order-at-your-seat food and drink + free popcorn), I was also pleasantly surprised by the picture and audio quality (not TOO loud, which is always my complaint at movie theatres) - though I would say they could stand to have bigger screens.  When you buy the pricier ticket, you sit in the back, and the screen is much smaller than the average (at least at that distance).  That is the singular complaint I have about this theatre.

Our food was great.  We got a flatbread and mushroom sliders to share, and it was delicious.

Also, the staff deserves kudos.  Everyone, from the front desk to our in-theatre wait staff to the random guy who intuited that I was looking for the restroom and pointed me in the right direction with a friendly smile, was top-notch.  I hope they pay them well, because they deserve it!"}
{"text":"I have been to my fair share of theaters but this one tops the list. When I first walked in I thought I had entered a restaurant my mistake. You are greeted by a hostess who discusses the current movie choices. You then choose where you would like to sit and have the option of regular seats or the plus section. The plus section is different because the seats recline with a leg rest, better view, and you have a server for the duration of the feature. Unfortunately during my visit the plus section was booked so we settled for the regular seats. 

I arrived a good thirty minutes before the feature started so I can explored the lobby. There was a restaurant, full service bar, and a concession stand. I headed towards the concession stand because I had to try out the self-service wine bar. I purchased myself a wine card and an order of truffle fries. I had myself a little tasting from a few different wineries; Joseph Phelps, Chateau Montelena, and settled with a glass of Silver Oak.

After grabbing my snacks I headed into the theatre and the best was yet to come. Rows of large comfortable leather seats which had tables for you to place all the goodies you just purchased. I got settled in and began to eat my fries and noticed that they had forgot to add \"truffles\". I began to walk out when a attendant stopped me asked what the issue was and said he would take care of it and I could return to my seat. A new batch of fries were delivered shorty after and then the previews began rolling, no advertisements were up on the screen before previews. 

The sound and picture quality were superb. The lobby, theater, and restrooms were clean. Staff was friendly and knowledgable. I will definitely visit iPic again when I am in the area.

I notice some Yelpers commented on the price of a ticket. For the experience and service I felt that the cost was worth it. This chain of theaters goes above and beyond to push a good product and attracts a classy crowd. My kind of place."}
{"text":"Hubby and I have been coming here since it opened 5 or so years ago. Then the orange micro fiber seats were clean, the sinks in all the bathrooms worked, there were plush hotel style paper hand towels in the restrooms and really deserved the wow factor rating. Since then the prices have increases by at least $10 a ticket, the orange seats are brown, stained with food and human debris, there is always at least one sink out of service in the restroom with cheap gray paper for hand washing. Rarely does anyone answer the phone. The seat design was doomed from the beginning with orange microfiber for a place expecting to house humans eating in the dark. A brown leather or black replacement should have been included in a remodel years ago. The blankets are probably a mucinex commercial of germs. There's no way they are washed between viewers. Yet..we still go. Hence 2 stars vs. 1. Why? Because it's only 1 of 3 reserved seating/dine in theatres in the valley where you can sit in a 2 seat section without getting kicked by teenagers or have pop corn thrown at you. Hubby also loves the buffalo chicken spring rolls and I the old fashioneds. So, we put up with the overpriced germy dirty seat fabric and hope one day Ipic returns to the 5 star establishment it started out as or we'll have to start going to Amc and harkins reserved seating theatres more regularly and just bring our own clean blankets. Come on Ipic. Reinvest in quality and hygiene. Please. I am a Sapphire member."}
{"text":"Before I begin my review, please scroll down to read the review written by Debra S.  PLEASE tell me she was 5 glasses deep while writing that review and MAYBE I'll understand a little bit more.  Anyway, trashy and completely stupid to say the least.

My boyfriend and I went to experience iPic this evening and it was the BEST date we had been on in I don't remember how long.  The level of hospitality went beyond my expectations; our server was so kind, articulate, and professional.  Also, I NEVER thought I'd be raving about movie theatre food-it was always something I kind of made fun of.  So, if you plan on going, save the extra money to have that much better of an experience.  It's worth it.  

The only problem is I consider every other movie theatre to be a complete dump now, and I can't afford that mentality (yet)!"}
{"text":"First time going to I pic and I love it.reserved the top seats and it was so worth it.the sound was great,excellent customer services comfortable chairs.only thing is why don't the servers have a machine that they can swipe credit cards at your seat instead of taking your card away?? I will be back a lot"}
{"text":"I don't get it.  This place is minutes from my house, but I won't be coming back.  

Two words: pretentious and expensive.  

Went to see The Imitation Game (excellent movie), and was told that they only had seats in front, which I guess are the inferior seats?  They didn't really explain the difference but told me I should have reserved ahead of time?  They gave me a member card.  That's all I need - another membership card to carry around.  I don't think I can fit another one on my key chain and the large card definitely doesn't deserve the real estate in my wallet.

The chairs in the second row were SO uncomfortable.  They were cushioned, bigger, looked great, but damn... no give, no pushing back a bit to recline.  I fly a lot and it was almost as bad as those seats.  My back still hurts and it's been over an hour since I got home.

On the computer screen I selected the seats - again in the 2nd row - and was told that the other seats (whatever those are) were sold out, but when the movie started they weren't sold out at all and a lot of the seats were vacant.  So, why were they blocked off?  Were we getting screwed because we were newbies and didn't have our purple cards?  I have to 'earn' better seats?  

If you want safe, very white, uppity movie viewing - then this place is for you.  Enjoy your cocktails."}
{"text":"Great place to take the family over the holidays or great for date night. Staff is friendly and courteous . Shopping available and beautiful view and experience. Definitely coming back ."}
{"text":"There is really NO better way to watch movies! The staff are phenomenal, the food is the BEST and you can even have wine straight from an amazing vending machine. This places is so high tech and luxurious it makes the Jettson jealous! 

Take your moving going to the next level and get your tickets NOW!"}
{"text":"Where to begin?  Yes, it is a bit pricey.  But not too pricey.  It pays to become a member - and membership is free.  The place is very uh...trendy.  Nice places to sit and wait for your movie to begin.  You can also have dinner here or get sloshed at the bar before your movie.  I think, at some point this may present some problems.   The staff is very courteous.  There were more lovely boys there than I have seen anywhere - many, many lovely boys.  I think they are the wait-staff for the Gold seats.  But we will get to that.  

The ticket sales are by machine or by human.  Lovely people behind a nice counter.  Your choices are Premier (17.50 w/o membership) no perks; and Gold - I forget the price, something like in the 20's and I don't remember if the blanket and pillow were a perk with our without the membership.  Yes, you read that right.  With the Gold you also get a lovely boy to fetch your food to your seat - even your wine.  Since we were Premier, when we went to collect our food we were told we were in the wrong place - that we had to go back to the counter.  The food on the trays was for the people in the expensive seats.
So now we know.

There is a menu at this place!  The popcorn is available, but nowhere to be seen.  And the butter machine hasn't arrived yet.  Everything seems to have a starting price of 4.50 and goes up as high as you would like it to go, I presume.

There are all sorts of lovely boys to point you in the right direction.  We went into theater 5.  We blundered into a section of orange seats.  So you don't make the same mistake, here is a heads up.  The Gold seats are actually the orange ones and the gold seats are the premier seats.  There are these little trays for your stuff.  If you are skinny, you can actually bring the tray over your lap - unless you like to cross your legs, in which case, this is a no go.  The seats are those theater things like you would have at your home theater, but they don't recline - well, the Premiers don't - don't know about the Orange ones - I mean Gold priced ones(?).  

You don't get the annoying Dolby thing or the THX thing or the Turn of Your Cell Phone thing or the Shut up and and watch the movie thing - which leads me to make a suggestion - PLEASE HAVE EAR PHONES PROVIDED - I only say this, because I think the idea is to kind of imitate a home theatre atmosphere except you are stuffed in with a bunch of strangers - and what if a bunch of them are sloshed - or simply being themselves, just like they would be at home?

The bathrooms are impressive, but here is another heads up.  The little thinggie that tells you whether the loo is vacant or occupied is really, really small, so you kind of have to stick your nose under the long bar thing that opens these floor to ceiling door.  The other thing is that the hole for locking the door is really, really, really tiny - so aim well or you will have people walking in on you - I walked in on someone, so I know.

The screen is awesome - overall I liked the thing and I joined and I will be back - this time I am going for Gold - I mean Orange - oh whatever and hope that I get a beautiful, beautiful boy to tend to my needs.  In my next review, I will tell you about the blanket and the pillow.  Stay tuned."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE going to this theater.  I love reclining in the seats and snacking on the caesar spears and a tap poured Stella.  I've never encountered anyone rude or out of composure; they are always kind, accommodating and full of personality.  I can't sit long in \"normal\" theaters without it being painful.  The experience of watching a movie out comfortably is worth the money; however, if it wasn't quite so expensive we would probably go more often.  My wife and I signed up for the free membership and that helps on price.  Her birthday is coming up on September 1st.  I'm hoping the membership gives her some kind of benefit on her special day!"}
{"text":"I loved it.  I have been meaning to come hear for a long time.  I remember becoming a member when they were building this location, however I had not had the opportunity or time to visit before.  One of my girlfriends invited me to watch Skyfall with her.  I didn't mind seeing it again the same week, specially in such a comfortable environment.  We sat down on our orange recliners and we had a pillow and a blanket, how cool is that.  When I go to other theaters, I usually put my purse on one side, since I don't like strangers touching me.  Here there is no risk for that, the seats are huge, I felt like I was in a cocoon.  After we sat down, one of the servers handed us a bag of popcorn.  We ordered our drinks and enjoyed the movie.  I told my hubby that I didn't care how much it costs, I am coming here from now on."}
{"text":"We've been to the iPic Scottsdale 4 times.  The first 2 times were pretty good although the food is nothing exciting and lacking in creativity.  The 3rd time, the service was okay but the food was again just so-so.  The \"luxury\" recliners are obviously wearing thin (the fabric is dirty and some of the seats were torn) and the experience was just okay.  This last time though will be the last time for good.  We decided to give it one more shot and this was the worst of all.  The service was terrible, the drinks were poorly made making them taste strange, the seats are even dirtier than before and there are more tears made prominent by the reclining seats.  The service was absolutely awful with us being served the wrong order twice and the flavor of the food was so bad it was inedible.  Not sure what happened but until these issues are resolved we are going to frequent other theatres."}
{"text":"When someone asks \"Do you want to go see a movie?\" the usual picture that comes to mind is a typical theater experience. Cramped chairs, sticky floors, a few kids crying because their silly parents have them out too late, etc. Since I am new to the area, I had never been to iPic...to be honest I had not even heard of it. So when I accepted the invitation I really thought, \"How fun! I haven't been to the moves in awhile!\" 

Upon arriving, I knew instantly that this was NOT going to be my usual movie going experience. The interior felt more like the lobby to a real theatre used for live productions. My movie buddy had been before and showed me around. Really with the wine dispensaries? And how about access to a full bar while you wait? I kind of felt like I was in Disneyland for adults. This place screamed maturity, which was fine by me!

Our seats were...well...amazing. Huge, cushy, AND able to recline. Ummmm...yay! You even get a little pillow and blanket, which works for me because I always freeze inside of a movie theater. Our waitress took our drink order (which came in real glasses by the way) and brought us some popcorn. We ordered dinner and chit chatted while we waited for the movie to start. The sound was perfect, the food was delicious, the service was great, and my first experience at iPic could not have been better. 

I will go back for sure! This isn't a weekly kind of outing because of the cost, but it is well worth it, in my opinion. It is a more luxurious way to see a movie and it really felt like a complete experience, which was exactly the intent I believe."}
{"text":"Just went for first time....AMAZING! Very comfortable recliners with a pillow and soft blanket. Delivered a great Mulligan mule...superb wait staff. Prefect date night!!!"}
{"text":"The food and drinks here are par. It's the service that causes the two star deduction. I come here weekly and there is always new ppl EVERY WEEK. I know the menu better than them and it's super annoying. I wish turnover wasn't so often"}
{"text":"Prices for tickets have recently increased from $18 to $25 for premium seats.
That's a little steep for a movie, even with comfortable chairs and wait service. We don't plan to return unless they have some kind of special or prices go back down.... which is not likely."}
{"text":"Although iPic theater very nice atmosphere I was disappointed that they did not have BUDWEISER Products. Now come on that is the Best Beer !!If I want Luxury I also want to be able to enjoy a Bud !! Hope they will get Bud Products in the Near future then I will go there again otherwise sad to say won't be going to iPic  :(  !!"}
{"text":"Oh how I love perks... and I really love the perks iPic offers, that allows me to attend special screenings of movies that haven't come out just yet. Last night, for example, I had the opportunity and pleasure to watch \"50 Shades Freed\", when it only officially hits theaters this weekend. Yay! That way, nobody can spoil it for me 'cause I've seen it before the masses. Oh, and you should all be jealous 'cause my best friend and I got pampered with bubbly and strawberries with whipped cream and chocolate... all while watching the handsome Mr. Grey on the big screen. Talk about a romantic evening. 

I truly enjoy iPic, and I especially enjoy bringing people with me here for the first time. Non-movie-goers are immediately sold on the fluffy comfy recliners, complete with your own table, blanket, and pillow, all while getting waited on hand-and-foot during the movie. iPic has a full menu, sure to satisfy whatever you feel like having during the movie. And if you upgrade your seat to the VIP area, you get a free bag of popcorn! Yes, please!"}
{"text":"The lovely and I have made two trips here - once in the Premium seating, once in the Premium Plus. Everything already reported is true, its clean, low stress, comfortable and pricey. We were totally jazzed about the Premium experience - reserved spots, no screamers...ahhhh. 

The Premium Plus? mmm OK. But just OK. And mostly because with food and wine its in the $110-$120 vicinity. Don't get me wrong - service was attentive, seats are relaxing and comfortable, greeting from all of the employees, great. Food was okay, wine was nice and not crazy at $9. Glad we tried it but for us, not worth it - free popcorn notwithstanding.  We will continue to go and enjoy the Premium seats."}
{"text":"A Five Star miss.  This place has the opportunity to be a 5 star destination but they need to step up the customer service. I wanted to try iPic for the very first time so  I started with Yelp and the reviews looked promising.  I noticed they said they had Happy Hour listed as YES so I went to the Salt Lounge site to find out more information.  The site was pretty but it told me very little other than stating \"The Ultimate Happy Hour\", that looked GREAT but it said nothing more so I made a phone call to see what was so \"Ultimate\" about their Happy Hour.   

My call went directly to a recorded message that put me on hold and after waiting about 3 minutes it went to a recording saying they were busy and to leave a message or remain on hold, I went through this for 4 rotations and no answer so I decided to leave a message.  (by the way this was around 4PM yesterday).   A call was made back to me and they left a message on my voice mail.  The message said that the only Happy Hour they have is for members only and is on Tuesday only.  That does not sound like an \"Ultimate Happy Hour\" to me, how about to you?  I do not like false advertising.

I decided to go anyway and my wife and I head out for a 4:55PM show.  The tickets were purchased online and at a cost of $16 for a self service seat, it was a little pricey.  

We went to the Salt Lounge for cocktails and waited some time until approached.  The bar tenders and servers were plentiful but it seemed like they did not have time for the customers, they were busy conversing with each other.  The bartender was very pleasant once she did approach us and we enjoyed our drinks.  

The theater was relatively empty and it is a weekend in the middle of our high season so that concerns me. In order to fill these theaters, they will need to make it more affordable and even more than that, have excellent service.  I feel that for $16 a seat, they should be able to provide service to my seat and it will also help them increase sales.   

Overall, this experience was nice but it can be SO MUCH BETTER."}
{"text":"iPic...why?

First, the positives:

You can reserve the seats you like
There is a wall between your seat and the row in front/behind you - so folks can put their feet up without kicking each other

Then, the less positives:

Small theater (ergo small screen).
Almost twice as expensive as the regular theater.
At-your-seat-service only if you buy the even-more-expensive tickets
No low back support in the 'cheap' seats - had to roll my sweatshirt up and put it behind me.
No Gluten Free offerings (other than popcorn)
Parking at Scottsdale Quarter is suboptimal in general

Things that weren't their fault:

Star Wars, The Force Awakens -"}
{"text":"Our movie was 11:15am so it was not busy or congested. Once the doors opened it took a little while for the hostess to reboot the computer but that sort of thing doesn't bother me. Very attentive of course. Seats are soft, almost a glove leather that recline. Pillow and blanket are a nice touch. Our attendant / waitress was on point and quick to refill both the soda and wine ( sodas are free refills ) I had asian chicken salad wrap she had lobster role. Both really good actually. She lost her Chanel sunglasses in the lady's room at the beginning of the show- we were both surprised that they were at the hostesses station after the movie."}
{"text":"This Place is Gorgeous! It's like walking into the W hotel. Classy! I enjoyed the trio of burgers, the specilaty cheddar popcorn and the prickly pear margarita poured into a martini glass so you can take the shaker and drink with you while you go watch a movie. Peferct date night."}
{"text":"This review is primarily from my experience in a business aspect going into the theater, along with . There are very strict policies they have to go with if you want to reserve a studio or seats for your company. The buffet they HAVE to include for every seat triples the cost you are already paying for by buying each seat in the studio. I understand that this is where they make a good chunk of their money (business to business after all). 

However not being able to work with a business that still wants to purchase food/drink, yet not go triple the cost, is very unfortunate. If it is a personal thing I think the theater does it 'alright' (you HAVE to buy the premium seats, regular does not give you a dine in experience). However I would highly recommend for B2B to stay away from this theater, there are other dine in theaters that offer B2B at a much more flexible standpoint (to name a few Studio Movie Grill, Esplanade, and Ultra star). And while they don't give you that ritzy feel I-pic does it certainly is nice for when you want to be flexible with your company event."}
{"text":"A movie theater that charges over $20 a ticket? Who doesn't say wow that sounds great I'm in?

My entourage and I were done dominating the pool party at the W Scottsdale this weekend and decided to go watch a motion picture. All of us were tired of Harkins Theatres and their cheap tickets and $1 drink refills. Who needs that I wondered...

After making numerous purchases at lululemon, we sauntered up the towering escalator to iPic's glorious entryway. As we entered two Bond girls wearing all black greeted us and asked what film we wanted to see. I chuckled and said I'm surprised you just asked me that.  Isn't Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter the obvious choice for me here? In fact, every iPic theater goer this weekend?

Still not understanding how they had sold tickets for movies other than Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter, my shock turned into sheer terror as I soon realized our seats were assigned and I could not choose my own. What does a man have if he does not have free will? Then a grim reality...our seats were in the very back row sunk into the depths of the corner of the theater. This was the equivalent of being the guy behind the guy propping up his sweaty girlfriend on his shoulders at a concert; we could not see. When I asked the waiter if we could change our back corner view seats before the movie he provided me with a puzzled look as if he had spent a day reading most of Twilight before realizing it was not a cool and bloody vampire tale, but instead something far greater.

After using most of the money I had been saving in my carbon fiber Terminator themed coin purse, I opened the menu and was further aghast. My god, I bemoaned, $15 for sliders and $8 beers?

They did provide free popcorn although that is similar to a Crip giving a Blood back the gun he used to take out another Blood.

When the movie ended, I realized three things; one, I had just watched the greatest film of my generation, two, how much better the film would have been if John Stamos played Abraham Lincoln, and three, wow iPic is expensive!

Next time I'll take in a movie at Harkins instead. I'll use the money I saved from not going to iPic to purchase Beverly Hills 90210: The Complete Blu Ray Collection or an autographed picture of the greatest fitness instructor since Richard Simmons, Tae Bo's own Billy Blanks."}
{"text":"Love the concept of this place. My mom and I have been going for a few years now and always have a blast. We start with fun cocktails at Salt. Then we go find our seats (its worth it to pay the extra $$ for the Premium VIP seating). Then we kick off our shoes, order some wine, recline our seats and enjoy. You can also order food there, but we usually go out somewhere else afterwards. Obviously I wouldn't recommend going here every time you go and see a movie but its nice that you can enjoy time out at the movies and really feel like you've done something special. Last time I was there we got free candy served in martini glasses in addition to the free popcorn. Sweet!"}
{"text":"Hubs and I went here for the first time last week.  We had a gift card from Christmas, otherwise probably could not afford to come here ($54 for 2 seats).  That being said I wanted to come here for the reclining chairs as I currently have a broken foot and need it elevated.  We had a good experience.  Chairs were beyond comfortable and free small popcorn was good.  Pillow and blanket appreciated.  Wait staff seemed nice, but we didn't order anything.  It's pretty much what I expected for a place in N. Scottsdale.  I look forward to going again, with a gift card of course."}
{"text":"The seating and atmosphere are top notch. The food however, no bueno. I ordered mozzarella sticks and my boyfriend had the four cheese flatbread pizza. The mozzarella sticks weren't even warm. They came to me at room temperature. And not tasty at all. His flatbread pizza was nothing impressive either. For the name, price, and reputation, I certainly expected better food. Giving three stars because its possible we picked badly from the menu. Will try again and see if results differ."}
{"text":"I went here for a girls night out.  We had some drinks at Salt before hand, I recommend the Bangkok Monkey, and then took our drinks into the theater.  The seats were VERY comfy and you had a little table to set your snack/drink on.  Your seats are assigned, so there was no trouble finding a seat.  Only downside is it's a little pricey.  But I think for a special night out, it's totally worth it.  My bum had never been so comfortable in a movie theater :)"}
{"text":"My wife and I desided to enjoy our 21st Aniversary evening here with drinks diner,  
and a Movie. Drinks and the movie where wonderful, but the service and diner was less than pleasing. We all know what happens when you asume things. So you figure when some dumps a ton of money on a classy establishment like this everything should be top notch! Not so fast! Our order seemed to be misplaced and then only one meal brought out cold (fish) where's the other??? I don't know! was the responce.. Not acceptable. I'll leave the rest to you all."}
{"text":"Ipic was once a very special place for date night or a special treat for our kids.  Instead of getting better with age, they got worse.  The seats and blankets seemed to always be dirty.  I had to have a mental war with myself to sit in this filth.  With all the bed bug issues in airports and other movie theaters... It has me frightened to give them the benefit of the doubt.  Simple, basic cleanliness.  Now I can't even find a movie on a weekend.  What is going on iPic?!?!  The last 3 times I have looked to go to a movie ( After not going there for nearly 2 years...) there seems to be only 1 movie option on weekends.  What am I missing?  Can you share a report on when seats and blankets are cleaned professionally?"}
{"text":"I thought IKON was awesome....this is another notch up! Seatside service, fully reclining seats...even pillows and a blankie!"}
{"text":"Pretty awesome!  The prices are kind of steep, but the food is the best I've had at a dining theater.  Try the mahi sliders and calamari (although the cocktail sauce isn't as good as the aoli)!  The sweet potato fries weren't as good - pretty limp/soggy.  The angus sliders were ok.  The coke was awesome (a LOT of places don't have the settings right believe it or not!).  

They keep the theater positively frigid so the blanket really comes in handy.  It is a bit dark in there so the blanket also doubles as a bib sometimes!  :P  The screen and sound quality is also tops.

Definitely a treat, but so far the best one I've been to!"}
{"text":"I was toggling between 2 and 3 stars, because the service and actual theater experience is great, however, the food failed so badly. 

I consider iPic a luxury experience (compared to AMC and Studio Movie Grill) so I hold them to higher standards. I ordered a prickly pear margarita first, and it was a bit on the sweet side, but the two lime slices they added helped even it out. Their wine list is decent and very fairly priced. I like that they offer glasses, half bottles and bottles. It makes it easier to get through a long movie with a half bottle than having to order multiple glasses. 

For food, I ordered their lobster roll with Old Bay seasoned chips. I have had better lobster rolls from McDonald's (yes, McDonald's sells Lobster rolls in Maine during the summer!). The lobster was not fresh. It was nicely presented and a good portion, but not being fresh was an instant turn off. The chips were close to being stale or overcooked. If they were meant to be fresh, they were not warm and the seasoning was not even. Some chips had a good Old Bay flavor, while others had none at all. I was so disappointed. I realize ordering seafood in the desert is always taking a risk, but I expected at the place like iPic, it would be safe enough to take the chance. 

The staff was great. They are attentive, but not in an annoying way. There are no buttons to push to call them, which I think is great. It stops people around you from buzzing them in the middle of a movie. 

Overall, if you have never experienced iPic and want to splurge on a nice date night or just take yourself out for a nice evening, it is worth doing. But if you are a frequent movie-goer and like to enjoy the dine-in theater experience, I think AMC is equally as good and a lot less expensive."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this theatre in an expensive area.
When we were allowed to enter and find our seats they were full of popcorn as was the floor. We had waited 15 minutes for them to clean.
This was the 2nd time it had happened.
The food is excellent it just doesn't make up for bad service."}
{"text":"Had a family affair for Father's Day at IPic. We saw the new Tom Cruise pic, which I wasn't a fan of, but my husband likes those sort of movies. It was his day after all.

Didn't have the premium seats, but sat in the leather seats in the front. Not that comfortable. If your short, the head rest hits you so your head is basically jutted forward and bent down. Wasn't comfortable for me, but my husband seemed to think so. Just a suggestion, make those seats recline just a little so the short people can enjoy them.

The sodas were a good size as was the popcorn, both of which had refills, so not total sticker shock. However, there's something about the popcorn at Harkins...just better.

We had brunch at Tanzy next door, food was great, service was great. Overall, a good experience. I'd do it again for and occasion or a special movie."}
{"text":"I am not a regular movie goer..but this I could get used to..Top notch service from internet booking to check in to some pretty good food and drink service and a really comfortable recliner..A good dinner and a movie date place but it will spoil you for the regular theaters forever.."}
{"text":"My wife surprised me with tickets for a dinner and show for Father's day. She also mentioned that she wanted to go early for the 7:15pm showing so that she was not eating in the dark. Well that didn't happen. We arrived at the theater at 6:30pm, ordered drinks and that took about 30 minutes before it was delivered and the waitress apologized. Then she took our food orders...The food never came, the people on each side got their food and we never received ours?? I had to stop a waiter and asked what was going on with our food order and he said he would check. To make a long story short, the waitress forgot to put the food  order in, arghhh. Another apology. They did however did give us our food for free, but it was already 55 minutes into the movie. In addition the tray for my seat was bent on on an angle so the drinks and food  kept sliding and the food would not say on the table. Had to use the side arm rest for the food and drink, Awkward. I've been to the ipic before and it seems this time around the place is a little run down-dated, I even had to brush popcorn off my chair before I sat down, that should of been a telltale sign that things would not be good. So most other theaters offer the same concept as IPic and at this point I'm going to explore other theaters. Too bad because it was a good experience at one time, but now things are starting to get run down and service has degraded. So much for a Happy Father's Day! thanks IPic- NOT"}
{"text":"Super nice theater, but man, is this place expensive!  We spent nearly $80 to watch a movie and eat some subpar food...not sure if we'll be back.  I would much rather spend that money on a fabulous dinner elsewhere and rent a movie from Redbox for less than $2."}
{"text":"Sold 4 stars for its trendy look.
Sold 3 for prices, food and premium seats.
The seats were very straight for my back but I like that they were wide.

It located inside the square. In front of Its Sugar."}
{"text":"It has now been over a month with no call back about my issue.  I still have a $61 charge that has not been reversed.  Wells Fargo is dealing with it now and I can't wait to see them produce the receipt with a random signature on it that doesn't belong to me or my wife.

Anyway, there are some pretty shady idiots at this joint for sure.  It is a nice place but make sure they don't screw up and put somebody's tab on your card because you will NEVER be able to get in touch with them to fix the issue."}
{"text":"I love this concept - dinner and a movie....finally!! One of my favorite past times is to go to the movies and this is such a comfortable setting. Love the wine bars and express service in the lobby - mood lighting and all! Brings back some \"je'n sais quois\" to an old and everlasting past time: going to the movies. :)
I love having the blankets...but I often wonder (like the airlines) if they are changed out after each use??...ok don't go there....still like the idea."}
{"text":"I treated my brother on July 9th to dinner and a movie. Our check in experience and food ordering was great (though extremely overpriced). However, there was a problem with the movie at one point and the sound continued while the picture went dark. This wasn't a huge problem in itself, however I was extremely disappointed with the way the ipic employees handled this situation (or didn't...).

Two employees came into the room and stood by the exit while someone was up fixing the movie. They made no announcement to guests and just chatted inappropriately between themselves. I could audibly hear profanity as well as a comment that \"this happens about once a month because ---[name of employee I don't remember]--- is such an *f------* idiot.\" This is extremely unprofessional behavior contrasting with the \"classy\" environment that ipic tries to promote.

Another incident occurred outside of the theater while I was on my way to the restroom. I heard one of the employees talking about when her shift is up and joining a group for shots. This in itself would not have been a major issue to me, but in light of what else was happening that evening I felt it necessary to include. 

Overall I was offended by the inappropriate behavior of the staff and was extremely unimpressed that no one took control of the situation or offered anything at all to the guests for the disruption. 

I will NOT be returning."}
{"text":"So after my last scathing review of Ipic I was emailed by the companies PR rep and received an apology for the bad time that I had.  They wanted to do anything they could to make it up to me.  I let them know short of redesigning their theaters and updating the chairs they wouldn't get me back in to their establishment.  I then received an email from one of the managers and he offered me two free premium seats plus a 50 dollar tab which I thought was more than fair.   So I happily accepted and made a reservation to go back.  

I chose to go see Into the Storm with my girlfriend and we walked in and had our tickets reserved with a friendly greeting from one of the managers on duty.  When I got in to find my seat we were given the very back row but our seats weren't sharing an arm rest and were separated from each other. So I went back out of the theater and was able to exchange them for two seats next to each other in the front row of the premium seats.  This was nice and not at the same time.  When you recline the seat all the way I had to rest my feet on top of the divider that separates the \"cheap\" seats from the expensive ones but it was at such an awkward angle it would make my leg fall asleep so I had to have my legs bent the whole time.  

I would love to meet the guy who came up with the design for these \"luxury\" theaters and smack him upside the head for thinking it was a good idea to give each person 0 extra leg room.  Then the issue of the seats came back.  This seat was no better.  Still has a bar or some type of support right in the middle of your back that is extremely uncomfortable and the cushion on my seat kept sliding out every time I readjusted myself.  Just all around starting to feel run down and in need of replacement and a redesign.  

The food we ordered was still over priced for what we got and not any better than something you can get at any other dine in theater experience for much less.  

I'm increasing my rating one star for the fact that the staff truly did care about my bad experience and I was blown away by the offer they gave me to get me to come back.   sadly though in the end it didn't matter. Comfort, bigger and better leather recliners, extra leg room, a small light by my seat to see the menu, a server call button, cheaper food and cheaper booze all win out over the Sub par IPic experience.  I don't think I will ever be back unless a complete over haul of their theaters is made.  For now I'll take my money and have it go further at the AMC suites."}
{"text":"05/22/2014 Update: I've been going to iPic in Scottsdale for a full year now, and I have to add that their customer service is outstanding and their General Manager, Lawerence M., is wonderful! If I had a sixth star to add, I would.
Thank you, Lawerence!!!"}
{"text":"May go down as a best way to start the night out for a best date night ever. iPic is the Waldorf Astoria of the movie theatres. My boyfriend set the seats up earlier that day and me , not really being much of a 'movies on date night kind of girl' , was kind of like, 'eh.. okay'. I was, however, blown away. We had intended on having dinner first at Tanzy, but we ate a little much bruschetta at our uptown meet up earlier. We headed over to Salt, within the theater, and ordered a nice bottle of Pinot Noir and made our way to our seats. We had second row, VERY cozy, comfy seats. You can order what you like from your seats.. appetizers, champagne, very 'up' mixed cocktails, wines.. desserts.. pretty much what your spoiled heart desires.  It's 21+ only.. No worries of children or babies interrupting your night at the movies with noise. Very clean bathrooms with nice amenities. AND if you don't want the wine bottle at your recliner or seat, you can always vend it from the cool wine carousel in the 'vending' area. There are even buckets of beer or soft drinks should you not desire the beverage of alcohol infused.  There is the option of free popcorn, but I am personally not much of a fan of popcorn. I just wanted my wine..my glass and my cute boyfriend on this Saturday night. 

TIPS--
--Order online.. do it maybe a day early for best seat selection and for the best, most popular movies. 
--Become a member.. It's free. It'll score you some good discounts on both the movies and other things.. like vittles and sippage. 
--Go early. Enjoy this experience of this pretty much one-of-a-kind theater experience.. iPic is only about a handful many in the US. Get some food at Tanzy and some libations at Salt. 
--Valet is free with Premium seating. 
--Pillows and blankets also come with upgraded seating. 

What's not to love about starting your night out here.. well, you can actually finish your night out here too. It's literally a one stop..everything in one place.. place."}
{"text":"I mean... it's pretty. And the food is pretty decent. I don't really mind grabbing my own food with a beeper, but something irks me that the \"cheaper\" seats don't recline. Especially after going to other places in the valley where the seats recline? I had the turkey burger and a beer here for a movie last week and was pleasantly surprised. Staff is always very welcoming and nice, but I prefer other theaters a bit more than this."}
{"text":"I've had a lot of great experiences at Ipic and I've had a couple really bad.  All in all however I think my experience with Ipic lately has been average at best.  Due to their outstanding competition, mainly Studio Movie Grill, Ipic only deserves three stars.  Let me explain...

The last time I visited here I wasn't able to reserve back row seats, so my family and I ended up sitting in front.  To our surprise, the front seats are self serve only and I ended up missing the beginning of the movie ordering food.  The theater doesn't even offer food runners.  So after I ordered, I had to watch them prepare it.

If you're considering going here, first consider Studio Movie Grill.  ALL seats there are full service and you even get a server alert button when you need a refill or want to order more wings.  Ipic doesn't have this in their full service section, most definitely not in front either!"}
{"text":"Samaita. Did a great job helping us.  Great job. Great theater.   Valets do a great job."}
{"text":"Seven days after Karen P. of iPic Theaters responded to my review and asked for my contact information I have not heard back from iPic or received a credit for the $48.00 charge for 2 tickets. I guess I shouldn't have expected anything different since our entire iPic experience was a disappointing disaster and definitely not what they advertise. I will continue to visit AMC Esplanade and encourage all my friends (who of course have been told this story and have continued to ask if iPic ever responded) to do likewise."}
{"text":"A gift certificate was what prompted us to try iPic, its not a place we would have driven to from central Phoenix.  We were apprehensive going in, but based upon review consensus we made sure to get the premium seats which the GC covered.  The food and bev was on us.

The lobby and bar area are very nice, we arrived plenty early to check the place out.  We chose a late show (9:55 or so) so it wouldn't be too crowded.  As soon as the theater was available we were inside checking out the menu and deciding what to order.  They had a $38 special: two entrees, one app, and two soft drinks (beer was $5).  Perfect. Buffalo chicken egg rolls, burger sliders, and fried chicken and french toast, plus sweet potato fries and beer to top it off.  The food is solid good, and our server was efficient until he left.

Some dings:

The online seating chart was off.  Online, I chose the two back corner lounges, but when we found our seats we were the 2nd and 3rd seats in from the side.  The end seat wasn't occupied so we moved over.

When our order arrived the movie was underway so you can't really see your food very well. Since we ordered so much there was very little space on those tray tables which aren't exactly level.  One would have to be careful not to knock something over and I was hoping I wasn't dripping any sauce or dip while eating. Not sure if its tacky, but maybe a small pen light or key chain light could be brought along to check things out once in awhile (and to sign the check).

About halfway through the movie our server announced he was leaving and had to close out the check.  Once he left we were abandoned after that point.  Our empty plates and glasses just sat with us for the rest of the show. We had ordered ice water too, and those went un-refilled which was a real bummer because I was thirsty.  I wish they had a call button at the seats in case we needed something. Meanwhile the other server was dashing around providing non-stop service to her section.

I had to lay in the lounge at an angle so my feet wouldn't touch the back of the recliner in front of me, that would be annoying right?  If the guy in front turned around he would be looking right at the bottom of my shoes. Awkward, and kinda gross for that guy.

Overall its a fun experience with decent tasty food.  Its a splurge including the food and drink, but we'll try it again."}
{"text":"Top notch theater experience but understand one thing- if you go here do not get the regular seats, get the upgraded ones.  The regular seats backing is freaking 90 degress (straight back) and very uncomfy.  The upgraded ones lean way back and come with a nice blanket too."}
{"text":"I finally broke down and saw my first movie at the famous IPic Theater.  I saw the Bourne Legacy - which was an amazing action packed movie.  My seats were selected by one of the managers in the establishment, as I indicated I had never been, but frequent the bar quite often.  I had no idea what this experience was to hold, but when I walked into my auditorium I was thrilled.  The theater was large, and there was plenty of space between you and the people around you.  I was directed to my seat by staff and sat down to a cloud of a seat that you just sink into.  The chairs recline and you have a pillow and a blanket - are you kidding me? It was a little slice of heaven.  The staff will bring you whatever you want to eat and drink.  The theater was a comfy temperature and the sound system in this place is amazing.  Let's just say when someone shoots a gun in the movie, you feel it. Wow!
I am really excited I was able to have this experience.  I recommend that everyone try this at least once, it will change how you view movies from now on.  

Thank you IPic for ruining every other movie theater on the planet."}
{"text":"We purchased 10 tickets a few days prior to my daughters birthday party.  The day of the party, they called to say they had a water pipe burst and there was no food, fountain drinks but they still had candy, bottled soda and popcorn. We asked if we could bring in pizza for the party and they were glad to accommodate. Kyle even called me back to say that I didn't purchase the tickets with my iPic account and he wanted to reimburse me the difference. When we got there, the chef came out and offered utensils and offered to cut and serve the birthday cake. Even the beverage manager stopped by to see if there was anything we needed. There were two other employees I interacted with and I have to say this is one of the best customer service experiences I have ever had. Thanks iPic!"}
{"text":"pricy but well worth it. several full bars in the lobby, reclining armchairs,  \"in seat\" service and more. imagine combining dinner and a movie in a uber slick setting and that's iPic. I was swooned :x"}
{"text":"For those of you wanting a cheap getaway, please turn away now.

For those of you with loud and obnoxious children, please turn away now.

That being said...

Welcome to Arizona's finest movie theater.  Located in the heart of Scottsdale Quarter, this movie theater features some fantastic perks.  These include:

A full bar with plenty of special drinks to choose from;

A gourmet kitchen with delicious entrees and to-go snacks;

Very casual atmosphere, very clean, very elegant.

This is the place to be if you want to have a special occasion, as they do not give you anything less than 100% excellent service.

I do suggest that you sign up for a free membership on their website, as it does give you some very nice perks.

Now, the movie that I just recently attended was Captain America, the First Avenger, in 3D.  Let me describe to you the experience.



You start your journey by walking into the movie theater.  Before you get into the theater, there is a table with tons of 3D Glasses waiting for you to take one.  These glasses are not cheap; they are electronic and provide for a great movie-watching experience.

Once you get into the theater, you immediately recognize two different sections, both very classy.  The first section is the Premium seats, in which you get to enjoy your movie in the comfort of a nice, leather seat.

If you are willing to pay a little more money, though, you get to sit in the Red Leather Chair section, known as the Premium Plus.  Here's what you get with the Premium Plus:

1.) A great size, fully electronic reclinable chair, with footrest included.
2.) A pillow and a blanket, for added comfort.
3.) Waiter service, in which you can order any food item and any drink, and they will bring it to you in the theater.
4.) A free (LARGE) bag of Popcorn, priced at $6.00 if you were to purchase it seperately.



Need I say more?


The experience is fantastic, The Salt Bar is exquisite, and the restaurant is quite excellent as well.  If you want the greatest movie experience that you will ever have, then visit this theater.

P.S. Don't forget to give your valet ticket to the iPic employee that checks you in.  They validate your ticket free of charge, saving you a $6.00 valet fee."}
{"text":"I'll never go to another normal theater again.
For real.
If I can help it.

I LOVED IT!

-1 star for the nachos.  I didn't think they were great.... 
But everything else was AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!

Loved it.  Really and truly."}
{"text":"LOVE IPIC! I love the staff, love the atmosphere and love the luxuries. First off, Sky and Dayna are both amazing. Best two members on the team (in my opinion). I've kept in contact with both of them for a while on social media but I think it is super cool that they make personal connections with guests like myself.
Next... the decor is very upscale and modern. It's dark and kind of romantic in the lobby and I love the set up with the Tanzy restaurant connected on the right side.
Finally.. there are so many benefits of coming to this theater! The reclining seats are cool and sure they can be found at other theaters however the seats are BIG and they come with a pillow and blanket! You can lounge in your chair with your pillow, blanket, bottle of wine, and movie snacks which is so worth the $25 ticket"}
{"text":"Well whatever issues with the service/wait staff going on toward the end of last year, I can positively say they are fully resolved. 

Since my last review I have been to iPic in Scottsdale on 2 separate occasions and BOTH of them were absolutely stellar. I mean perfection. So wonderful that I was skeptical it was a fluke, hence why it took me a few more times to really, fully, believe iPic is once again a true movie experience. 

Attentive wait staff? Check
Unlimited popcorn (2-3 refills and fast) Check
More wine? More iced-tea? Check, check
Awesomely timed dinner and dessert? Check
DELICIOUS food? Check

I always get the VIP upgrade b/c I love the seating (becomes a giant bed with a super soft blanket). 

Really, THANK YOU iPIC for your constant attention to service and willingness to improve."}
{"text":"Unquestionably the most luxurious movie experience in town.  While the tickets are expensive, being able to recline with a beverage and foot brought to you makes the movie more of an event that you get in the standard, sticky floor theaters.

Service is sketchy sometimes...wait staff on some occasions are brilliant and others are missing in action.  

STill worth the risk for the overall experience."}
{"text":"Pretty decent lobster roll, great service, and beers during the show.  Nothing more to say really other than don't cheap out and buy the regular seats.  Spend the extra few dollars for the full service and the reclining chair. Your date will like you better."}
{"text":"On a recent visit I treated friends for their birthday. I was trying to set up in advance a dessert treat for them to enjoy, but in calling the theater twice I got disconnected both times while put on hold. So I chose to email which I never got a reply. 

As for the actual visit, we had premium plus seats. Pros- seats are very comfy and reclining.pillow and blanket provided. Staff is friendly- refills your drinks and small popcorn is included. 

Cons- It's difficult to communicate with staff during movie and not disrupt fellow movie goers and the movie itself. The wait on drinks and food take longer than it would to get it yourself. The cost is high for tickets/food/drinks."}
{"text":"I would have previously given iPic a high rating until I went to the movie the other night with my family to see Solo.  I was delayed with my son.  My daughter and wife went in to order and get seated in the premium seats.  My wife ordered for she and our daughter, was beginning to order for us when she was asked if her husband was arriving soon with a credit card to pay for everything she ordered.  This type of outdated sexism is unacceptable."}
{"text":"\"Dinner and a movie\" doesn't do iPic justice. This is the COOLEST way to watch a movie. They've got many of the new releases you come to expect from any theater, but the comfort and service you would receive from a posh lounge.

You've got options. Purchase the regular seats closer to the screen or the uber-stylish reclining ones towards the back. The regular seats are still quite good, though if you're ready to do things the right way, and you should be, throw down for the more expensive experience. Here's what you'll get if you do:

-Leather reclining chairs
-Complimentary popcorn
-Comfy blanket
-Full menu and wait service

iPic shares the same kitchen as the excellent conjoined restaurant, Tanzy. Before the movie, the previews include short interviews with their renowned chefs that tease you with glimpses of their signature dishes. No fair! Now you HAVE to order everything on the menu.

It truly is an unforgettable movie-going experience. If you've never been, just do it. You'll be happy you did.

**200th Review!!**"}
{"text":"Taking in a movie at iPic will make you never want to see a movie at a \"regular\" theater again. You will feel like royalty reclining in the oversize chairs complete with snuggly soft blankets. There's a full menu with some tasty treats, too. The loaded fries are delicious, and the short rib flat bread is superb. Of course, this place is a bit on the pricey side. Movie tickets average about $18 a person (matinees can be a few bucks cheaper), and then you have your added food costs. If you want to save some dough, I'd recommend eating elsewhere before coming to the movie and just having water and popcorn at the theater since they're complimentary. The extraordinary service and stellar surroundings make it a worthwhile place for your money to see a movie. If you want to avoid the stereotypical Scottsdale clubby attention whores and douchebag meatmarket crowd, avoid this place on Friday and Saturday nights as the crowd from next door bars filters over into the theater."}
{"text":"Ipic did do a great job on our next trip. Food and beverages were great as well as service. They provided us with two sets of free movie  tickets, unfortunately we've only been back once and the others dissapeared..."}
{"text":"You step inside iPic, and you are welcomed with mixtures of natural stone and wood, candle light and effect light, all screaming class and sophistication.  This is, without a doubt, a Scottsdale business.  Though this concept of upping the experience for movie goers isn't an entirely new concept, it is somewhat an unfamiliar concoction of classy dining, comfort, and blockbuster entertainment-- in the United States that is.  The employees are just as remarkable.  Like running a five-star restaurant, iPic trained their workers to serve with utmost respect and accommodation.

However, this type of service does come with a price.  This five-star pampering would probably cost you ten times more than a plain Jane theater.  Worth it?  Well if you have around a hundred for you and someone special-- and what a proper location for such a business.  Oh you got to love them Scottsdale folk!  

Would love to see this concept spill over to the home of MGM Mirage's Aria-- Las Vegas.  The incredibly good taste of iPic's entirety would blend seamlessly with the city's most gorgeous cosmopolitan setting on the strip.  

Overall, you are looking at a handsome, yummy, exciting, new theater experience here.  Now all you have to do is try it for yourself.  It will be an experience to remember!"}
{"text":"Just do it - this is one of my favorite places in Scottsdale. The calamari is to die for. Drinks are great, service is good, prices are reasonable. Upgrade to the VIP seats it is 100% worth it - they even provide blanket, pillow and free popcorn. This is my weekly treat - love it here!!"}
{"text":"Just left IPic Theaters in Scottsdale with a sore neck and back. DON'T ever get the tan \"premium\" seats. They don't recline at all and even though they are a beautiful leather, I've been more comfortable in airline seats. The film--Railway Man--was so intense my husband and I didn't want to walk out and miss the show, so we sat and suffered.  I didn't realize till the end of the show that my husband was as uncomfortable as I was. We complained to the manager--Phil--but he said he'd never heard a complaint about those seats before--however I've read quite a few online complaints, so I suspect he was \"marketing.\" The theater lobby itself was awesome and the filet mignon sliders were to die for.
So, either pay the $25 or so for the \"premium plus\" seats or go to your local Harkins for a better experience.
           Cynthia C."}
{"text":"I feel so spoiled after seeing a movie here! You get to sit in either leather seats that are super comfortable or a recliner where the staff brings you food/wine during the movie. It costs almost double the cost of a regular movie ticket, but when popcorn and extra luxurious seating, I'd say it's worth it to take your special someone there. The crowd is also a bit older, so it's pretty quiet when you enter and watch the movie. Seems like people like to dress up and hang out around the lounge which we checked out and thought was alright. I thought the concession stands were cool, bc they had a wine vending machine and the food looked great. 

Oh and the bathrooms were awesome! I think that was the cherry on top for me. It was just super clean and really sleek looking. Definitely a place worth going to. And if you sign up online to become a member, you get $3 off each tickets, which is easy enough to do =)"}
{"text":"OK,
We came back! But we did have company, I decided to give my wife and daughter a iPic and Tanzy Christmas gift! Had a 10am Les Miserables show on Christmas day. We had a great time, maybe this might be a yearly thing now? This was my daughters first experience, and was wowed!! Movie was very good, girls liked it and cried through out the movie. We had our lunch during the show and it was great! (See the Tanzy review for food rating!) Yes the prices are higher but you are getting a lot more. No I can not afford doing this all the time, but yes wife and I will come back again and again."}
{"text":"I love the IPic concept, but it's not for everyone, and by everyone, I mean me. 

Thirty two bucks to see a movie in a theatre with less than optimal sound, small screens, and uncomfortable (general) seating holds very little appeal for me.
Not when for less than half the price, you can get much tastier popcorn, experience a vicious sound system, sit in a semi comfortable seat, and, with the popcorn and drink pass, get both for one dollar at a local Harkin's theatre.

On the other hand, If you're looking for a fun date night, I can't not recommend the Tanzy, IPic, Salt, triumvirate. 
Mainly because you won't be going there for the food, movie, or high priced drinks.
You'll be going there for date night, and by date night, I mean any combination of expensive activities designed to irretrievably guilt your date into surrendering her panties at the end of the evening.

However, when geting laid isn't your big panacea anymore, (like me, mrrrr) these three places mean dick.
No, I'll just schlub the night away for pennies at Harkin's and In & Out, since my poonslaying days are now only distant memories."}
{"text":"The tickets are too expensive. The seats are uncomfortable. I don't think it is worth it."}
{"text":"I came back to update my review as I came back to a completely upgraded theater atmosphere.  Everything is remodeled, up to date, friendly and classy.  We had a chicken BLTA wrap and roast beef sandwich which were pretty amazing.  Ice cream sandwiches during the movie were over the top scrumptious as well.  My soda was flat, but with the end of their construction coming and everything else was perfect, the 5 Stars is definitely deserved!"}
{"text":"Went here tonight to see deadpool with my boyfriend. First of all, the theatre is gorgeous and the staff is really friendly. We had premium plus seats - eh comfortable-wise but the blanket definitely came in handy since I forgot my jacket.
My main concern about coming here was that the waitstaff constantly coming over would interrupt the movie but it didn't. They were quiet but very attentive! I never felt interrupted.
The food is also excellent - often at restaurants I order steak rare and it comes medium rare but it was definitely rare here!! That was very much appreciated.

My boyfriend and I are going to make this a special occasion kind of place since the tickets were $50 for both of us and $60 for dinner (two entrees, a side, and one cocktail). Definitely worth checking out but there's no way to lift the armrest between you and whoever you're with so if you're feeling like you want to be cozy and cuddle, I'd go to an AMC."}
{"text":"Love this place, way better than the other normal theaters, I was getting tired of seating in stiff and nasty seats but than I came here  and feel in love, I really like the food, it's pretty good for a movie theater,  pretty expensive but than again its scottsdale, the inside of the theater is so classy and upscale. The seats are really comfortable too. 

A+++"}
{"text":"Great theater.  Popcorn is hot and good taste.   Comfortable chairs but don't get one that is at the top of the stairs you'll be inconvenienced when people go up and down"}
{"text":"Nice facilities! The theater is on second level of building. So when you walk up, you immediately feel removed from the hustle and bustle of mall. Walking into this theatre, you have the feeling of entering a swanky night club--the decor is extra slick (almost bordering on cold), but it works, lighting is mellow, and there is open bar. 

Once in the viewing room, the fun continues... Seats are very plush, recline smoothly, and you even get a blanket with small pillow to maximize comfort. The complimentary popcorn was completely unexpected but nice touch.  Added bonus, even from the furthest back seating-the screen is easily visible.  I notice that the front seats aren't too close either.  So truly, not a bad seat in house."}
{"text":"From the design and decor to the outstanding service, ipic is a treat.  
The seats are comfortable, the sound excellent, and the picture quality is pristine.  
It is like an oasis for a relaxing cinema experience, complete with treats and fun food options.
My kind of place."}
{"text":"I've never been to a place like this before.  All I can say is that I don't think I'll be able to go to a regular theater again.  I've been here about five times and I never regret paying the premium for everything.  The fillet sliders are great.  They also give you free popcorn!  How can you say no to free popcorn?  

Okay so it's a little pricey for the premium seats, but it's a treat if you don't mind the cost.

P.S. Be prepared to dish it out (see what I did there?) if you decide to watch \"Chef\" while being asked by a server what you want to eat as you watch the movie."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I never leave yelp comments. However, after last night, I will NEVER return. I have been to this location at least 2 dozen times. Evidently, never early enough when the lights were on. The orange seats were completely filthy with a black tinge on them? Do they ever steam clean them?? The blanket rolled up had some kind of pet hair on it. Do they wash those? or the pillows? There was popcorn and food stuck in the crevice of the seat. Something dark and sticky spilled down the side of the arm of the chair. I looked at the customer next to me and said \" oh my gosh these seats are filthy!\" And he agreed! The movie previews started and then the movie started. Still no server. I only wanted water. But the sever must have asked me 4 times if I wanted a drink? something to eat? dessert? a cocktail?
Nope, just some water. Half way through the movie, my \"neighbor\" who I was not there with,  asked my if I wanted popcorn? I was a little thrown off and then I realized that the server was trying to pass popcorn all the way down our aisle ! Very strange, considering my Husband and I were sitting right at the stairs on the other side! Having customers pass the popcorn around? Just lazy customer service. I am truly disgusted with this place. You pay top dollar ($25 a ticket plus food or drink) and realize you are sitting in a pig pen. My husband and I usually buy a bottle of wine and some food while there, but last night I just couldn't bring myself to do that anymore. You have been warned. Show up in the dark and be oblivious, or show up with the lights on and be disgusted."}
{"text":"the theatre is great . We have done this twice thus far in the most expensive seat section. Very comfortable for sure . Regarding food , the food quality is excellent however the service is not good . Once they deliver the food you might as well forget about them checking on you . I ordered Fish and Chips (very very good ) and the salt shacker they brought had clogged holes ....meanwhile I am waiting for a server to come back and he never did ...so I had to eat the chips without salt !!! I never judge anything by just one time so I again ordered food another time we were there . Again , lousy followup after the food was delivered ...will never order food again . It is a shame becasue the food quality is good ...just the service is very poor ."}
{"text":"This is how movies should be. 
Not only are the chairs large and extremely comfy, but the staff is friendly and the food is good. 

This is the only theater that I've tried the dinner and a movie experience, but if you have chocolate covered strawberries on your menu in a movie theater, you are golden!
The rosemary chicken skewers were fantastic, not too much or too little rosemary and juicy too. 

The movie itself was good, about the same quality of your regular theater, but on a smaller screen (there are about a third of the seats in the theater though, so its not necessary for it to be as large as the jumbo size AMC or Harkins screens)
all in all, i never want to see a movie in any other theater. 

ps, join there member/mailing list for cheaper seats and other deals, plus showtimes. its worth it."}
{"text":"I came to iPic with better expectations. I came to iPic to get my ticket, drink (s) and food all in a timely manner. I came to wine and dine in extreme fashion and class; however, none of this was the case.

Instead, the guest services hostesses were extremely rude and snooty. They apparently could not find my reservation in the system, kept on answering phone calls and making reservations all while letting me miss the first 10 minutes of the movie and I arrived 30 minutes early. Not once did they offer their manager to resolve the issue, even after I asked and was grossly ignored. The line was atrocious, absolutely no way of circumnavigating this and expediating this process. So no complaints as far as the line comes. That is until you get to the bar and order your drinks and dont even get looked at once! This one bartender finally recognized that I was waiting for a drink, comes over and takes my order, tells me the food will be delivered too my seat in the recliner seats (which I will get too later). All fine and dandy - the bartender Kimberly made perfect drinks, was nice and acted like she knew how to do her job. 

NOWWWWW, this is where it all goes spiraling into oblivion. A) serving staff had 0 - zero ziltch nada - knowledge of menu for simple questions I didn't ask at the bar

B) These seats all need to be ripped out and burned!!! As soon as I sat down, I could feel food caked on from when this theater was opened up. And I mean from 2010 not like the day they opened up shop. My seat was broken and I let my server know. They got me in another seat and that was really expedient and quick, but everything after that seemed like slow motion.

C) My server was really nice and put my drink order in, or atleast said he did. I waited a good 30 minutes before seeing him again and of course the drink he brings me is watered down. I immediately let him know my displeasure and he assured me theyd make another one. This second one was also watered down and took another 15-20 minutes.

Overall, I don't get the hype and do not recommend anyone to sit in the premium plus. Also, dont drop your phone into the depths of the premium plus seats. I found tiny little yellow spiders and years of uncleaned popcorn in the seats. They desperately need to get pest control in there and clean every nook and cranny because I also saw fruit flies swarming the hallways, cockroaches by trash cans and the theater I was in had movie theater debris all over the place as if the cleaning staff said screw this theater. Definitely an upsetting experience, and now out 78 bucks..."}
{"text":"I went to iPic with a girl friend who was here from out of town back when it first opened and we had a blast! Since then, I've been trying to get my fiance to go with me but he thinks it's too expensive.  However, last week was his birthday and he mentioned that he'd like to go see Elysium at iPic.  I was thrilled!  I got online and purchased 2 of the premium seats ($54).  Upon arriving we were happy with our seats and we got settled in for the movie after ordering cocktails and food.  Our server brought us our stuff and we didn't see him again for over 45 minutes.  My fiance was out of beer but still had half of his flatbread left.  I FINALLY was able to wave down another server and asked her if she could please get us another round.  15 minutes later our original server showed up and asked us if we needed anything (uh...yeah...an hour ago!).  We ordered our round from him, as the other server never showed up with our drinks.  And, again, we didn't see our server until he brought us the bill.  Sad to say, I did something that I NEVER do...I tipped him $1 on a $67 check.  That's $67 on top of the $54 I paid for the tickets.  I'm sorry, but if I'm going to pay top dollar for a \"premium\" experience, I expect premium service.  Maybe iPic should at least install call buttons on their chairs like my preferred theater AMC Esplanade.  Save your money and skip iPic and choose AMC Esplanade."}
{"text":"Big and fancy, but a little lacking compared to the AMC Esplanade. For starters, no server ever came by to see if I needed/wanted anything during the previews.  I found out later that is because we paid for the non-premium seating (which still cost a small fortune.) The non-premium seats are comfy, but they don't convert to love seats or have trays for you to put your food/drink on, nor do they recline.  These amenities, along with complimentary popcorn and a blanket and pillow come with the premium seats (even more pricey) though!  So even with a membership, you're gonna fork out $25 a ticket on the weekend ($17 on a weekday).  Crazy.  There is also no matinee pricing.  Could be why it was nearly empty on a Sunday.   Anywho... It's okay.  If you want to be able to pick your seat ahead of time and not fight the lines, have \"free\" popcorn, and don't mind the price tag, its a nice enough theater.  Best bang for your buck? Not even close."}
{"text":"I have to give this place 5 stars for concept alone. As hard as I have tried to turn my house into a private screening room, it just never compares to going to a theater and catching a flick in that setting. The idea that I can have someone bring me food AND booze while I am watching the latest blockbuster just makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. Our server was very nice and the seating was great (get a membership online and go for the gold class seating). I would have taken away a star for the tad bit of confusion with the seating/ordering scenario, but when they brought me a pillow and a blanket everything was right with the world again."}
{"text":"I've got to wonder who goes to the iPic Theaters at Scottsdale Quarter on a regular basis.

Movie tickets alone cost $20 for members (membership is free) who want fully reclining seats and a pillow and blanket (regular seats are $15 for members.) Is it really worth that much money to feel like you're lounging at home while watching a movie on an extra-large screen?

Compared to the AMC Esplanade 14 in Phoenix, where tickets cost only $6-$15 for everyone, the iPic theater was an extreme rip-off. My ticket to the same movie last night, which was $20 at iPic, would have been $9 at AMC Esplanade-and the food at iPic is worse. But I guess because they're catering to an affluent clientele that visits Scottsdale Quarter, maybe iPic can still survive.

The theaters are very similar in that servers take care of all the patrons by bringing them food and drinks throughout the film. I was very unimpressed with the menu at iPic. The most appealing items were a quesadilla and a four cheese flatbread-the quesadilla was laughable, costing $10 but served as a very tiny portion. The flatbread was alright but not spectacular since it was so crispy. The cheesecake brulee dessert was the best part of the meal, but it's not something I'd rave about. Considering the extremely high movie ticket price, I wish the menu had more variety in it.

Overall, I would never choose iPic over AMC Esplanade 14. Even though there were empty seats next to us, we were sat right next to another couple and could hear them whispering throughout the film, whereas it seemed like the Esplanade had a more intimate feeling. The menu at the Esplanade is leaps and bounds better, as well, and the ticket price is the most obvious reason to avoid the iPic."}
{"text":"I could post like everyone else about how awesome the seats are and stuff - but I will share this instead.

My son has type 1 diabetes, and we weight out all of his food and keep a close count on his carbs.  I got to the theater and realized the battery had died on my portable scale. They asked what I was trying to do - weighed the fries out for him and put them in a separate container on his own tray.

The staff won me over big time."}
{"text":"I see the appeal of iPic, but this is the most overrated movie-going experience ever.  We went to see Moneyball and had to get reserved seats in the front row.  I thought there was no way the front row of an iPic theater would be as bad as a regular movie theater, but I was wrong. In fact it was worse because the high seatbacks wouldn't let you comfortably look up at the screen.  In addition, the servers were rude and everything was incredibly expensive.  We spent $70 for 2 tickets to sit in the front row of a movie theater and drink one glass of cheap wine each.  Not worth the \"upgrade\" to a large leather seat.  Stick with Harkins or AMC for a fraction of the price."}
{"text":"iPic has a funny way of making a Box Office SMASH seem like the best movie of the year! Mi amor&I went to check out this new hot spot several months ago and bought tickets for *insert sub par Vince Vaughn movie here.* Checked in for our reservation at the front desk and proceeded to the snack bar. What's a movie without yummy snacks, right?! The wine dispensary is a nice touch, but I went with a Sugar-Free Red Bull. Oh, and chocolate covered strawberries?! Don't mind if I do! 

The whole place is absolutely stunning, however the BATHROOM is amazing! It has an Old Hollywood glamour feel that reminds me of what Marilyn Monroe's powder room might have looked like! The big leather seats reduce cuddle factor, but are super comfy. It's kind of close quarters & at times I worried that my feet were too close to the person in front of me, but hopefully that's a little glitch they can fix in iPic Phase II :) Overall this theater is divine & gives all other wannabe luxury theaters a run for their money!"}
{"text":"Great place to see a movie, deft not your typical theater. It is more than a regular theater, but I guess you get what you pay for. It is also in a great location so be sure to walk around the quarter when you get done. Great shops and lots of great places to eat"}
{"text":"I am completely spoiled and don't know if I'll ever be able to enjoy another movie theater the same way. IPic provides an experience like no other. VIP tickets are a little pricey but it's worth every penny. You get a recliner chair that practically turns into a bed. You get a blanket and a pillow and you get a waiter at a moment's call. As soon as the previews start, the wait staff appears with trays of complimentary pop corn that's fresh, hot and ready for consumption. It seriously is an A+ experience and makes you feel like you are watching a movie in your own home theater."}
{"text":"Tried to find a review on here from a parent with younger kids, and couldn't find one. So, I figured I would go check it out with my kids and write a review for you parents out there. I was not even sure children were allowed, as I heard somewhere that they did not allow children, or maybe it was no children after 7? Unsure, but we went to see a movie at 7:15 with my 7 and 10 year olds and no one said anything about no children allowed. I was not sure this place would be kid friendly, but to my surprise everyone was very nice and friendly to my children. I had never seen a movie here before, only had lunch at Tanzy and drinks at the lounge with friends. So, a  friendly staff member took us to our seats, got the kids all set up  in the recliners and got our waitress within seconds. We went on a Tuesday, which has special pricing for members, and our waitress offered some good suggestions for the kids for snacks. I meant to take a picture of the menu, but forgot! Bummer. Beers are $2.00 on Tuesday though, and wine was $5.00. Sizes are generous on food and drinks and the choices for beers was pretty good. A big glass of Stella for $2.00? Bargain! Free popcorn in the reclining seats, too! They had some appetizer and meal specials for Tuesday as well, which ranged from $6 to $14, roughly. Tater tots, flatbread pizza, fish and chips, sliders, to name a few. Movie quality is awesome, good sound, great picture, stealthy wait staff I never noticed helping other movie guests. Fast service from the staff, by the way! Also worth noting, they have a very clean family bathroom, in case you have younger kids with you. For movies in 3D, this theater is not much more than others,  and I would rather come here  any day! I would recommend this theater highly! Great experience, and my kids LOVED it! They already mentioned they want to come back to watch superman. :)"}
{"text":"The cons:
The place has an \"old house smell\".
The chairs are big, red, suede material that smells really bad and feels damp.
The pillow they give you smells even worse! Like cheap cologne and body odor.
If you go weekends it is 27$ per person. No kid discount, senior discount, or military discount.
The pros:
If you become a member(free) and buy your ticket before 11am, the front seats near the screen are only 12$.
The customer service was top notch.
The bathrooms were like a 5 star hotel, maybe even better!
Overall I am not going back because of the smell/unsanitary conditions.
For 27$ they should provide disposable pillow/blankets like the airlines do. 
Nobody wants a used pillow gross."}
{"text":"To be able to sit in a big comfy chair, eat some good food and drink a beer while in a movie theater is an absolutely wonderful idea. I would highly recommend for everyone to try this even once. The price is steep at $18 a ticket but it's well worth a great experience."}
{"text":"It's hard for me to relax at anything and it's hard for me to just sit around. My daughter and my wife took me here for fathers day 2012. Never had I enjoyed going to a movie as much as I did going here. It is more expensive than other movie theaters but, when we go to ipic for a movie it feels like we have been on a great date! The food is expensive but is very good. This will become a frequent date night spot for me and my wife!"}
{"text":"after a gracious gift of 2 free tickets from iPic after the Tanzy Yelp event, the wife and i are totally spoiled. we reserved our seats online and when we arrived to pick up our tickets, we knew this wasn't your average movie theater. 
in a sense i feel guilty knowing i should be at the regular theater in my income bracket, but at the same time....wow....this must be how first class passengers feel on the plane!
we had 2 seats with no one on either side of us. the chairs were overstuffed and plush. they reclined. they had pillows. and a blanket! A BLANKET! popcorn came with our tickets and we did order food and drinks. the sweet potato fries were a huge hit with the wife and I. our server was so quiet and stealthy, we never saw him unless we got thirsty and magically he appeared! 
we wanted to stay longer and watch the movie again in our comfy spots, but it was time to go back to reality. what a really cool movie experience."}
{"text":"Great service and extremely comfortable reclining chairs. Their fresh strawberry lemonade was delicious, as well as the complimentary popcorn.  Although it is expensive, I would certainly recommend it to friends."}
{"text":"If your looking for a unique way to watch a movie and have dinner-this is it! From the decor to the cozy premium seating it's a first class experience. Highly recommend as a date night to celebrate an occasion, the cost definitely isn't for your everyday movie. My only recommendation is that they have an usher or the staff help you find your seating as that was confusing for first timers. We will coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Get the premium seats or it's not worth it. My friend was gushing about this theatre but she's never ordered the food before. So we'd thought we would try some. Well, unless you pay for the seats higher up, you have to go outside and order. I didn't care that much but it's inconvenient, for sure. 

My biggest complaint are the seats. Now they looked plush but throughout the movie I've never felt a stiffer seat. Weird. You can't recline even slightly or anything. It was like sitting in a (hard) box. I've never had to adjust my seating so much during a movie. I'm 23 and felt like I developed back problems at the end. To compare, I've never encountered this problem in any theater (normal or dine-in). 

I think the stars were fair for the experience. I would have rated lower but I had the nonsuperpremiumplus-whatever experience so I can't judge on the other one. Stars for quick service at the ticket counter and for the ability of reserving seats.

EDIT: To clarify, in the photos where it shows the overview of all the seats, I'm talking about the lower, tan ones. My date felt the same way."}
{"text":"ok, this place totally caught me off-guard. Visited my sister-in-law over the weekend and she recommended going to the movies. I figured it would be a nice theater because it's new and located in the nice Scottsdale Quater. But, I didn't realize that it was connected to a Vegas-style lounge/bar and was like a lounge inside the theater itself! They even have ushers to show you to your seats. I couldn't believe they had wine-tasting dispenser machines (classier than it sounds), and that you could take your glasses into the theater with you! We didn't get the VIP seats, but our reserved seats were great! I think that a theater like this would be an instant hit in the SF Bay Area, and I only wish I had the capital to invest in one. I could image it would be great for a date-night. Yes, the tickets are pricier than normal, but it's all about the experience, right? Regular theaters where you're fighting for the armrest with the stranger next to you sucks. iPic is awesome."}
{"text":"Well where do I begin....well let me start with the entrance into this establishment. When you walk in you will immediately notice your walking into luxury....where hostess' are waiting to check your reservation and send you to movie heaven. Now if you not in the gold class seating where the chair recline...no worries...the other seats are just as comfortable. I went tonight because by becoming a new member back in December I got a free ticket that I couldn't use until now....due to the fact that I have been busy....not because the ticket said so.....didn't want you to be confused there. 

If your hungry or thirsty they bring food made to order to you and drinks to...that you can enjoy while you are watching your movie. The have an outstanding restaurant there called Tanzy and for those of you who want a cocktail or just a simple beer they have a bar called Salt. The atmosphere and ambience is just fabulous....they even have a wine dispenser that let's you press a price on a touch screen and it dispenses the amount of wine your paying for right into your glass.

Now here is my favorite part....and no offense to parents out there with children.....but if you go after 7:00 pm to any of the IPIC Theatre's NO KIDS ARE ALLOWED....you have to be over 21 to get in. Now at my age now that makes for good business because I would like to enjoy my movie in peace. So if your in the mood for good food....good drinks....a great atmosphere....and a great show....come to IPIC in The new Scottsdale Quarter....and you won't be disappointed. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!"}
{"text":"Ultimate in Luxury Cinema. The chairs are as comfortable as my bed, the AV system rocks, and the food I had was pretty damn good. 

Excellent date night spot."}
{"text":"Get the premium seating for the full experience and at-your-seat service. The high prices also help keep the screaming kids out, so we love it! There isn't another place in the area that comes close to this."}
{"text":"Love assigned seating, love the extra space, love the cocktails.  It really kicks up the standard \"dinner & a movie\" date up a few notches."}
{"text":"The bestie and I decided on a whim to check out iPic since we were in the area for brunch and shopping and decided going to dinner would be a bit excessive. One of us remembered iPic was nearby and we'd been wanting to see Titanic while it was in theaters. So we walked in and got a couple \"premium\" seats for $18.50, and settled in for a great movie.

Pros-
Impressive lobby area
Ability to choose exact seats(and reserve ahead of time)
Comfortable seats with adjustable tray
Self serve wine \"tower\" with good selection(Rombauer chardonnay!)
Even the front rows are set back enough from the screen to be comfortable
Crazy cool bathrooms

Cons-
Not very user friendly at front desk, maybe because we didn't reserve seats
Employees don't seem to know much about food/drink menu and were less than helpful when asked for glasses or when wine tower wasn't working.
Price point, $18.50 isn't terrible but $27 for the extra special seats (before food or drink)is a bit excessive.
Very little self parking available. Valet is validated but there can be a long line.

Overall good experience enjoying a glass of wine with the bestie while watching a young Leonardo DiCaprio in comfortable seats. Not much customer service unless you're willing to shell out the big bucks. We will probably check out other theaters with this same concept or visit again on a week night when there aren't the hoards of cougars and people seeing movies in club wear."}
{"text":"This theatre was amazing!!  Arriving early for the movie my sister and I decided to sit in the bar and wait. On the weekends they offer a mimosa special 4 for $10.00. Our server, Greg, told us all about the menu and was so knowelegable about not only the menu but the company itself.  We decided to have the homemade potato chips while watching the movie. They have servers in the theatre that will bring you what ever you'd like. Food was amazing, service was great, chairs were so comfortable.  I have moved here from Portland OR where we have several types of theaters like these and they are fun too, howevere none are as upscale as this one.  It was a fabulous was to spend the afternoon. I can't wait to go again but next time I'm going to try the Tanzy restraunt..."}
{"text":"Uncomfortable seat (there was a bar like thing sticking out of it. I would have made a thing out of it had I not been on a first date.) and a filthy under the seat (I dropped my phone in the crack. I expect more for the low low price of $27/ticket, not to mention the high costs of snacks (which I expected). So, all told nearly $100 for some uncomfortable and dirty seats that almost detracted from the brilliance that was Wonder Woman."}
{"text":"I have been a member of the iPic membership program for almost 2 years and have caught about 7 or 8 shows to date at this theater.

The seats within the actual theater are nice and the acoustics of the screens are pretty good. I always book the premium plus seating and without fail all the premium plus seas are fairly good except for Seats 7 on the right side of the premium plus seating area. Both time I have sat in this seat it felt like I was too far to the right of the screen to see properly.

The experience itself within the actual iPic complex leaves a bit to be desired. One thing I have noticed for example is that the sizes of the complimentary popcorn have gotten smaller over the past 2 years. This is a cost savings move (although seriously...if 3 extra ounces of popcorn hurts the bottom line so much the iPic management and investors should concentrate on real cost savings like sending home extra personnel on slow nights or paring down the wine inventory instead) but iPic members who frequent the theater notice sneaky moves like this.

The food and drink selections are diverse but as many others have noted the service is very uneven in the premium plus area and three times I remember distinctively having to go and hunt for a waiter while the opening scene was about to or had started in the movie. The entire premise of the premium plus seating area is personalized service and the Scottsdale location is very uneven in this area.

The other aspect I will comment on are the attitudes (this is not a knock to mgt of IPic but an issue with a lot of the clientele in the Scottsdale Quarter) of the other patrons in the Salt Lounge and Adjoining Tanzy restaurant.  The attitudes, which are laughable (who has an attitude because they live in the backwards Phoenix area, have a $700 car note, live in an apartment and like to front like they are special because they are spending the little money they have left in the Scottsdale Quarter) are a bit of a turnoff. 

Although the attitudes of other patrons may seem trivial, it is a factor that I am sure keep many away from IPic theater Scottsdale after only one visit. I have had a chance to check out one other iPic in Pasadena, CA and the patrons were normal people, not the plastic (in many ways) creeps that abound in the Salt Lounge, Tanzy and the Scottsdale Q in general.

To expand on that point; iPic Scottsdale is no longer the only premium theater chain in the Phoenix area.  I have in the past 6 months visited both Ultra Star Cinemas in Scottsdale and the AMC Esplanade Dine In on Camelback in Phoenix and found both of these theaters a more enjoyable experience than iPic.

Competition is a good thing and hopefully the Scottsdale iPic can tweak its offering a bit (cant do much about some of the clientele but that's another matter) to keep iPic members like me but the proof is in the pudding and lately I prefer to have my pudding at Ultra Star or AMC Esplanade."}
{"text":"My wife and I recently visited iPic and enjoyed our visit overall.

We spent some time in the Salt bar with drinks and nachos appetizer (yum).

We saw the movie Green Hornet 3D (movie was crappy in my opinion, can't blame iPic for that..).
The 3D glasses we used were dirty beyond dirty.  Perhaps someone needs to clean/sanitize them on a more regular basis.  iPic's classes are not made for those who wear glasses like myself as the 3D glasses kept falling off my nose throughout the movie.  

The seats in the non-gold class are comfy leather and do not recline.  You may find yourself with a stiff back at the end of the movie and doing stretches on the way out back to Salt and/or Tanzy for a post movie drink."}
{"text":"For those of you who know me, I like things that are posh, swank and stylish. Who'd have ever thought that this could apply to going to the cinema? iPic really is the business class of movie going. It's like W Hotels and Virgin got together and opened a movie house. 

I walked through their restaurant, Tanzy and it was dark, cozy and intimate. The lobby itself, is dark, swank and dare I say, sexy. There are a few self-service terminals and as well as a check-in desk that felt more like a concierge at a hotel. I caught a glimpse of their bar, Salt and it look just as posh. 

No food this time around but my 22oz Samuel Adams from the take-away area was very reasonably priced under $10 which was a pleasant surprise given the surroundings. The folks the work that counter are very friendly and personable.

They really make for a pleasant, unique, movie-going experience. Yes, you could be paying nearly twice what you pay at AMC or Harkins (they're local...keep that in mind!) but there are so few movies out nowadays that actually compel me to go to the cinema that when I do go, why not make the night an experience.

This is actually a great venue for a date night, or a group night out with your most  discerning friends. I see myself coming back for \"Malificent\", the next \"Hunger Games\" flick, and of course, the next \"Hobbit\" film. Go to Harkins if you're being dragged out to see the next stupid Adam Sandler movie. But for a real event, shell out the extra cash and go out of your way to come here."}
{"text":"I like a good movie and best of all I like to watch them in comfy theaters.  While the place is comfy the service is subpar.  There has been 3 times that even after the movie finished I had to hunt down my server to get my bill!   The food takes forever to arrive, even just the basics - water to drink.  They changed their menu recently and took off their line up what was actually a great caesar salad.  On this Yelp page they even still advertise pictures for it.  You can't ordered it, trust me I have tried."}
{"text":"I was there last night to see The Fighter.  Saturday was their second official day of being open and there were some things I liked and some things that could have been better.

The space is gorgeous.  As some people mentioned, it looks like a hip hotel or nightclub.  In fact, their Salt Lounge could be a cool place to hang out even if you don't go to a movie.

We sat in the gold seats which are in the upper level of the theatre.  These are large, comfortable seats that recline.  Unfortunately, I'm 6'2\" and couldn't recline my seat without my feet hitting the chair in front of me.

When we were seated someone came by and asked if we'd like a blanket and pillow.  Shortly after that a server came by and asked if we'd like something to eat and drink.  We asked for a couple of waters but they never came.  After about 15 minutes I got up and went to the snack bar to get some water.  They only had one register open so I had to wait longer than I'd expect at a premium movie theatre. I never saw any of the free popcorn either.

The quality of the picture on the screen was excellent and the sound was great.

I'll be back and hope that they have worked out some of the service glitches by then."}
{"text":"Great theater for an 8 month + pregnant woman.  I actually felt very comfortable in the reclining premium seats.  Service was good as well as the popcorn.  I would definitely come back, but not on a regular basis as the tickets for the Premium tickets are much more costly than a regular theater.  With that being said, it was well worth the inflated price to feel comfortable for an evening and enjoy a movie!"}
{"text":"This was our first time at ipic and we had a great experience. The reclining chairs were really nice and we felt worth the price. Food was good but took a little while to get to us. We will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Luxury theater pretty much says it all.   It's expensive, but comfortable.  Check out Salt bar for a drink before or after the show. Although tough to have a couple drinks and then watch a movie without falling asleep, but at least you can take the drinks into the theater.  Assigned seats is nice, but you have to buy tickets early to get good seats which takes some planning.  We sat in the 2nd row, which was way too close for comfort.   Not an everyday type of theater, but worth a visit for the novelty alone."}
{"text":"I cannot believe I had not been here prior these past two weekends. Although I would love to get one of the coveted seats in which you can order food 20 mins into the movie and it includes popcorn, a blanket and it reclines, the regular seats are just as comfy. I see why they are not able to bring food during the movie in those seats as they are very close together and it would drive people crazy. Although I will say this is why I enjoy their cheaper competitor that will not be named. All in all, this is a GREAT date night place to go to a movie. The seats really not  much more than a regular movie seat although the food prices will leave you saying WOW! Will I come back? Absolutely. Definitely give this place a try if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend as a great date night! Sign up as a VIP member for free on line. Pre-order GOLD seats as a VIP member.Go on a Tuesday night if it's your first time. Dress nice like you were going out to a nice bar/dinner. Back row or a two-some recommended. Come early to show, have the valet park your car (part of the GOLD cost). Go to Salt Bar and sit at bar - amazing apps (calamari, flatbread pizza, salads) at happy hour and beer $3, think house wine was $5. Nice tinis too!  Buy a glass of whatever to go at the bar, take your pre-assigned seats early enough to get comfy and get a blankie/pillow. Recline back and enjoy free bags of popcorn. We ordered a flatbread pizza that arrived about when the movie started. Runners can only serve/take orders 15 min into the movie then you're on your own. We saw the Figher but The Kings Speech is still showing too! Afterwards if you're still hungry, head to Tanzy for a late night dinner. Very impressed with venue, although ticket prices are $35 for two on Tuesday nights, I think it's totally worth it with the VIP Happy Hour pricing. We ended up being too stuffed for dinner, so the evening cost us $100. TOTALLY was one of the best date nights I can remember!"}
{"text":"Best theater in town! They have great food and drinks. I love the atmosphere, the comfortable sitting and awesome service. I would recommend to anyone. It is a little price, but it is worth ever penny!!"}
{"text":"There are many different reviews on this place, Im trying to find somewhere to take my boyfriend for his birthday. Would this be a nice place or is it really not that type of place? We've always wanted to try something like this, but maybe not for a birthday? help!"}
{"text":"Well the concept of this theater really appealed to me. I still think the concept is great, however thought in the execution seems to have been absent.

We showed up at 9:20pm for a 9:45pm show. We waited outside the ropes for about 10 minutes until we'd be allowed into our theater. This gave a a few minutes to look around. The theater is linked to both the Salt Lounge and Tanzy Restaurant with coordinated decor making for a very stunning and appealing sight with a comfy feel. We had just came from dinner at Tanzy's (separate review). We ordered the Gold package and were told our server would take care of everything once inside the theater.

Once we were allowed to enter everyone entered the same door. It wasn't until we were trapped in the line that we realized there was another door on the other side that would have sped up the wait to get into our seat. Maybe if they were both open that might have streamlined seating.

we got to our seats, got comfortable (more on that), experimented with the electric recliner and generally got situated. Once our server showed, we ordered. My wife wanted a white wine. The server highly recommended one of their Chardonnays. We learned after tasting that 1) don't take wine recommendations from someone not old enough to drink and 2) iPic doesn't know a quality wine from vinegar. The Chardonnay was easily the worst either one of us had tasted and we didn't finish it. 

We ordered Chocolate covered strawberries and the Oreo Ice cream sandwich. Our server didn't know they were out of the ice cream sandwich and told us when she delivered the strawberries. Probably a good thing since that probably prevented another food abortion. The chocolate covered strawberries were also horrible and unripe. My bet is, they're not made on premises but charge as if they were. After just eating at Tanzy, I wrongly assumed the menu would be similar since I believe they're owned by the same. Menu was not great..at least the dessert menu with it's three options. The other option was a Berries Sabayon which the server tried to push after our two previous dessert failures. 

Not long into the movie my wife noticed her 3D glasses were dirty. It took about 30 minutes before we saw our \"server\" again to ask for another pair. The second pair was better but not much. They reuse glasses and the high school kids working there probably aren't too into cleaning them well.

Comfort. I was all set for a nice comfortable recliner. Not. There is a metal bar running across the middle of the back of the recliner that will be guaranteed to let you know it's there by the middle of the movie. I spent the second half of the movie trying to avoid the bar to no success. The only way I was able to minimize the bar in the back was with the foot rest down which kind of defeats the point of a recliner. Since your feet won't touch the ground (and I'm 6'1\"), that is an uncomfortable feeling as well.

While the concept is fantastic, the designers and operators really ignored the details. If you build it, they will come is not a good business model. They may come.....once. And once it will be. We will not be back."}
{"text":"I've experienced better dinner theaters in other states.

Make sure you book the premium seats.  If you don't you will need to wait outside for your food.  Food service only happens for the premium seats located at the back of the theater."}
{"text":"This is such a great way to see a movie. We get the chairs way in the back.Super comfy. The chair lean back, feet go up and relax. There's great distance between you and the people next to you. It spoils you. They also give you free popcorn (yee haw!)

Dinner is brought to you and they have special trays. The only problem is once you get your food, the wait staff never appears again. Of course the movie is going and you don't want someone interrupting. But if you've got a problem with your food (says someone who has never received utensils), you're out of luck 

The food is either great or bad, nothing in between. So I would catch dinner at one of the great restaurants in Scottsdale Quarter or Kierland (right across the street) and just go for the movies.

It's a great date night."}
{"text":"For my first time at this theater I saw Goosebumps in 3D. Obviously the theater, service, and seats were the best part of the experience.  I have a big head and the glasses squeezed it a little and they were a little heavy, but the overall the movie experience itself was good with great picture quality and sound.

We paid the extra $10 for \"premium plus\" seating which includes free popcorn, reclining chairs, a small pillow and a throw. It's hard for me to believe, but it's worth it. If you get a small popcorn (free refills) for yourself it's typically $5.50 then the rest for an extremely comfortable couple hour movie experience. It's great. The staff is attentive and friendly. I would have liked a few more food choices though and it's a bit on the expensive side with most entrees over $14.

The entire building is decorated very well and I heard they have couches in the bathrooms. Great place."}
{"text":"Normally I just love iPic since discovering it a year or two ago.  So comfy, private, quiet, unlike a lot of movie theaters these days. And very clean and a beautiful bathroom, plus restaurants on site.  The in service dining with Premium Plus seats is great.  BUT, the chef has recently changed their unbelievably awesome chicken strips to a pretty inedible replacement.  My girlfriend and I almost only go there for those, they are so amazing!  The batter, the chicken, the BBQ sauce, all worth blowing your diet for a week on.  The last time we went, this past week or so, they have removed them from the menu!  Now there are these squishy, mushy weird tasting things that have chicken inside, and that part was ok, but the breading was gross, they fell apart to the point you couldn't eat them and tasted terrible.  I am horribly disappointed they did this.  It was really the only thing on the menu I couldn't live without and would go there on purpose and sometimes buy them from Salt, the bar inside, even when I wasn't seeing a movie.  PLEASE bring them back!!"}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences. My boyfriend and I went to iPic for the first time and purchased the premium seats. The place was very nice, seats were comfy and very luxurious. Although, I must complain that this place has horrible service. We ordered and our food came out prior to our drinks. There is no way to call a waiter once your movie has started. We waited so long to get a waiter, I was starved so I took a bite of my appetizer and they brought me the wrong food. At this point my boyfriend got up and walked out of the theater to find someone, mind you at this point we had our food for about 30 mins. It took them almost 15 mins to come back up to us. They corrected my appetizer and brought us our drinks, but the sprite my boyfriend ordered was just carbonated water, no taste of sprite at all! They corrected that for us and by the time we started to eat our food was extremely cold and the movie was already half done. This place is very nice, but the service is horrible and absolutely not worth the money you pay."}
{"text":"IPic is a great place for date night or a girl's night out. Highly recommend getting the premium plus seats! They recline! Signup online and get your tickets cheaper and advance. You also get to pick your seats, so buying in advance gives you a better chance in getting the seats you want. Getting to drink alcohol and eating a full meal while you are watching a movie is a bonus!"}
{"text":"Wow! This is some serious movie theater business!  They are not messing around with their movie-going fanciness. I've never been in such an upscale movie theater...made me forget that I'm not rich for a minute or two. But don't worry, once I saw the ritzy Scottsdale crowd swarming the joint I quickly remembered my place. 

Oh, and when I say swarming, I do mean it rather literally. The place is not hurting for business so I don't want to hear any wealthy Scottsdale peeps complaining about the economy. If you can afford to come here on a regular basis then I'm pretty sure you're doing okay. So I should preface this entire review with the fact that I received free iPic tickets during the Elite Tanzy event (which was awesome by the way). They spoiled us with premium plus seats which include valet, popcorn, a reclining seat, a blanket and pillow during the show, and a server who takes your order from your seat. Premium plus tickets go for $25 a pop which is clearly not cheap, so that's something to think about if you're considering a movie here. You also need to consider the fact that it seems to pretty busy. We tried to come to a movie on three different occasions before we were finally able to book seats over the phone four days in advance. So be prepared to call ahead or book online beforehand. This is not the type of movie theater where you can just show up and head in. 

The movie theater itself is really impressive. They have a full menu, a full bar, and some seriously classy digs. The place is clean, stylish, and not lacking any expense. It really made for a special night out and I would highly recommend it for a date night.

Unfortunately, this is where I have to share a little bad news. Our service was absolutely horrible. I'm talking waited-at-least-thirty-minutes-just-to-get-a-glass-of-water bad. It was NOT good and those of you who read my reviews know that I am not one to shy away from a low rating. However, in this situation, I really believe that it was probably more like a freak accident instead of a regular occurrence. I seriously doubt iPic is going to allow poor service on a regular basis. Especially not for the upscale types that they're serving. So I'm going with my gut that it was just a fluke and giving them four stars anyway. Although I do want to expand on the kind of service we received here the other night...

We arrived early and were quickly greeted by our friendly server. He gave us the iPic spiel (since we were first timers) and took our order (two beers, two waters, and an order of mozzarella sticks). This was all about 10 minutes before previews began. Our mozzarella sticks came out quickly (so the kitchen must be doing something right), but we waited through all of the previews and at least ten minutes of the movie before we even had our waters. That was AFTER watching everyone around us get their drinks and asking a second time for our waters. Oh and did I mention that they were out of the beer I ordered? Kind of disappointing. They also delivered popcorn to everyone around me (including my husband) and I eventually had to ask for mine. When we did finally receive our drinks, the mozzarella sticks were cold so we didn't get to enjoy them like we'd hoped. 

After that the rest of the experience was pretty nice. Our movie was hilarious and the chairs were ridiculously comfortable. I didn't really like that the server came to close our bill an hour before the show was over though. Seemed awfully early...what if we wanted to order something else? I also felt it was rather distracting and wasn't able to enjoy the movie quite as much. If I were to come back to iPic, I would probably choose the more affordable seats without the server. It just wasn't worth the hassle or frustration. 

I do want to end this review on a positive note because, like I said, the place is really something to see. I would have to agree with Nydia A's review that described the place as more of a lounge than a movie theater. I promise you won't be disappointed with the overall atmosphere and hopefully your server will be better than mine. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I have to give a HUGE shoutout to iPic Scottsdale!

I honestly didn't think it could get any better than the last time I went, but the newly remodeled iPic Scottsdale is OUTSTANDING!

This iPic has everything! It's in a great location, the establishment is stunning, the food and drinks are not only delicious, but they're also very creative and fresh, and the staff is well trained on fine dining service; plus, you get to watch a movie in deluxe comfort.

We decided to see Avengers: Infinity War this afternoon.

Our seats were right in the middle of the theater in the VIP section. I couldn't ask for anything better.

We started with some appetizers, including the hot pretzel, mac 'n cheese sticks, and the filet sliders. All were fantastic, and served right away, before the previews even finished.

We also tried the meat pizza, and we each had a piece of cheesecake for desert. The cheesecake had a sort of crème brûlée thin top, which was incredible.

They serve plenty of free buttered popcorn, and I had the Norma Jean cocktail, which was vodka, strawberry, and lemonade goodness.

Our server was on top of his game, and extremely enjoyable.

CONCLUSION

Our experience at iPic Scottsdale was flawless.

5/5 RECOMMEND 

***************ORIGINAL REVIEW***************
*************************************************

BACKGROUND 

I'm a huge fan of iPic theaters! The first time I went to iPic was in Pasadena. 

Make sure to read my review on iPic Pasadena. 

Since that experience, I couldn't wait to go back to iPic again. Luckily, there is an iPic in Scottsdale at Kierland. So, I opened up my iPic app, bought tickets, and grabbed a friend.

THE STORY

We decided to see Daddy's Home 2 (which was hilarious). 

We had a bit of an issue trying to find the entrance, as it's not apparent; it's tucked inside the mall, not facing the street. 

Anyway, true to iPic style, there was a grand entrance at the top of the escalators. Going to iPic feels more like you are attending an event rather than just seeing a movie. 

There are giant beautiful hallways that are filled with sexy art and cool lighting.

The Scottsdale location is less dramatic than the Pasadena location, but still amazing. 

Once seated, the \"ninja-like\" servers got started! We had some yummy cocktails and snacked on unlimited free popcorn whilst we waited for our dinner. 

We had the calamari, filet mignon sliders, and mac 'n cheese with lobster. Everything was YUMMY!!

SERVICE EXPERIENCE

There was nothing that could have made the experience better. The service was 100% on point. 

CONCLUSION 

In retrospect, it seems RIDICULOUS that it took until 2006 for people to be able to receive quality food and drinks, and to be able to comfortably lounge with a blanket, whilst watching a movie. I know I'll never watch a movie the old way again.

I will definitely be back to this location or others.  I'm a HUGE fan of iPic!

{"text":"iPic Theaters, I love you and hate you at the same time.  I am not the kind of girl who sits down and looks at a computer screen and times to figure out what movie I want to see on what day and at what exact time, but that's exactly how you work.

Had received passes to experience a movie in the Premium Plus Seating,  I had one and my besty had another, and with bit of luck we both had the same day off and thought ok off the movies we go. Boy I was excited to check you out!  

Walked and told the host what movie we would like to see and she without asking anything else said did you make reservations? Um no, we are just flying by the seat of pants here, she looked up the movie we wanted and said there were no Premium Plus Seating for that showing, or the next 3 more of that day too,  we were told the ones that were not booked were the premium seating, but our tickets didn't cover for those.  

Now I'm feeling frustrated and wondering why I just didn't say to my besty hey lets just go, the host noticed we were about to leave and said let me call my manager to see if we can down grade your seats.  At this point I didn't even care about what type of seat I was seating in, just wanted to be able to watch the movie with my best friend. 

The manager ok'ed us to be downgraded, gave us a stern lecture about how the pillow, blanket, popcorn and food service is not available. So we got our seats and went to watch the show. Have to say when we made our way into the theater I had to ask to be directed to our seats since I hadn't been before and didn't have clue, the server told us with a flick of her finger which way to go.  Left me with the feeling that I was a second class citizen that had to move to the lower deck to get a seat.  

The movie we saw was wonderful and great, the seat was comfortable but it was very cold in the theater, made me think of the blanket I wasn't getting.  

I like the feature of being able to recline in a chair, have food brought to you while watching your movie, but what I don't care for is that it has to be planned.

So if you go make sure you make your reservations if that Premium Plus Seating is what you're going after for.  Thank you iPic for the chance to experience you, but I think I just might be too flighty for you. I don't know days or hours in advance what movie I want and when, but that's me, not you."}
{"text":"Love, love the style and decor.  Feel like we are at a fancy club to watch movies.  LOL!   They have a full bar, food services, wait service, or can you order at the stand like the regular movies.  We booked our tickets online.  The seat were comfortable.  Plenty of places to place your drink and food.  Loved it!!!   Plus we went to watch Magic Mike..."}
{"text":"YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS PLACE If you haven't yet!

I got to go here back on July 15th while in town on business. I have one here local to me so knew it was a great way to get away and grab some lunch and catch a movie. I saw Grown Ups 2 and was really impressed with the Mall it's located in and the entrance and Premium Plus + seats are just amazing.  Service was excellent as always.

If you've never been to a VIP theater this is worth it.  Where else can you can be like your at home, be served restaurant food and enjoy a movie all at one place.  Plus the awesome thing is you can pick your seats out, purchase it all from the iPad, iPhone or Android app or on the web even a week in advance so you know exactly when you're going and where you are sitting vs showing up and hoping you get a good seat or a seat at all as you find with normal theaters. 

Don't forget to with Premium Plus you get free Popcorn, a recliner, pillow and blanket with a personal waiter or waitress to get you drinks and food through out the movie."}
{"text":"This is the best movie experience comfort & luxury wise that is being offered..period! The VIP seats are more comfortable than my home sofa, you get to recline fully and kick your feet up, there is a blanket & free popcorn provided - awesome. Definitely go the upgraded route. As far as picture & sound quality, it gets the job done. I wish they would upgrade to a laser projection system like Dolby Cinema or the new Cine Capri in Scottsdale has. As far as an extremely luxurious movie going experience complete with in movie servers, gourmet food & drink is concerned, IPIC is the KING of comfort hands down."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb.  

The owners pulled out all the stops for a luxurious experience.  I love it when I go into a place that is so wonderfully designed, full of attentive staff that my mind goes into a cold freeze and I'm happy to pay $15 for a movie ticket plus $15 for 3 tiny little burger sliders.  I didn't care what the price was, I was so in love with the experience.  Now that's getting the customer hooked.

Saw Twilight Series, Breaking Dawn Part 1 here with 2 other girlfriends and all of us loved it here.  It was the perfect place to see Team Edward or you know, the other team, who?

Don't miss out, grab your gfriends or significant other and go check it out.  Perfect place for a date night."}
{"text":"This place is NICE.

BUT...Expensive. 

I wanted to do something nice for my boyfriend on his birthday so I took him here and got his ticket price mostly covered for being a member(free sign up). When i say mostly i mean the seat is covered for the cheaper seat and you pay an additional fee for the LA-Z boy type seats that feel like suede. I LOVED THOSE SEATS. If all theaters had those seats I would be in heaven because you do not have to place your feet above the chair in front of you if no one is there or wiggle around constantly to get comfy so you do not cramp up.  
By buying the upgraded seats you are SUPPOSED to get a free bag of popcorn, a pillow a blanket and a waiter/waitress to bring you a totally different menu of items than what is available in concession stand/main lobby area.   
I had ordered a brownie ice cream dessert type ordeal and it wasn't as amazing as i thought it would be. But i can be severely biased sometimes when it comes to baked goods because that is what i do on a regular basis is try to out do other peoples or restaurants baked goods so i usually do not order them if we go out unless someone else suggests otherwise.


The experience would have been a million times better if they had a movie worth watching than the one we had watched at the time(our idiot brother) i honestly feel as though to get the full awesome experience, make sure you go watch something you know will be good and worth spending top dollar on.  Otherwise you will feel not completely satisfied when you leave and furthermore.  Also the service that we received was decent, kind of irritated with the waitress because she never brought us our popcorn and when i reminded her twice the 3rd time back she only gave us one bag i felt so jipped when i spend this much money at a movie theater and food and tip at this establishment how are you going to jip me woman?! Seriously??"}
{"text":"A completely exciting experience. Some reviewers insist that it is not a \"novel\" idea so it isn't exciting, but iPic is really good. Everything is high-end, clean, and professional.

If you get the top seats, you get popcorn, pillows, and a blanket and a really sweet movie watching experience. You can order drinks (reasonably priced) and food. 

You can get the bottom seats and still enjoy all of the above, except no food.

Overall, I've been here three times and I've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I've since been back here, and just wanted to update the review. 
Very professional, prompt service! I look forward to being back again."}
{"text":"End of the road for Ipic Scottsdale. It's current condition is run down, seats are worn out, the service is terrible, and the food is horrible and over priced.  Save money and go to studio or roadhouse.  I cannot say one positive comment about our date at Ipic tonight. We paid for VIP seats which were disgusting and worn, our server interrupted the movie 6 times and our pizza was served straight out of the freezer with cold cheese."}
{"text":"Great experience! And the seats recline! Will definitely be coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Best cinema experience ever! Once you visit - returning to the mere mortal-dom of regular cinema's will forever be marred by your knowledge of the other side. My husband and I went to see two films this week - one in the cheaper option seats, and the second in the high end reclining section. Both great - the higher end well worth the extra splurge - table service for the first 20 minutes, complimentary popcorn, pillow and blanket. The lobby and surrounding eateries have a high end feel to them - perfect for a pre or post imbibe. Thank you cinema gods for increasing my opinion of the humble Sunday night film session!"}
{"text":"The only gripe I have here is that my 3D glasses were kinda scummy, and no matter how many times I dipped my straw into my glass, and cleaned them with my napkin, I just could not get them cleaned off completely.

Imagine sitting in a huge, comfy chair with a glass (as in, used to be sand) of ice cold liquid, a gourmet flat bread pizza brought to you by a server, all you can munch popcorn and a little button you push to recline your chair, while you watch a first-run movie. This is the experience at iPic Scottsdale.

It was Thor 3D. The sound was amazing and the picture, though a little fuzzy because of my scuzzy glasses, was awesome.  

For me, it was the whole experience, not focusing on how good or bad the food was, or how good or bad the service was, but I rate iPic on these criteria:  My ass. In a recliner. With a cold one. Brought to me by a waiter. And a pizza. Brought to me by a waiter. Watching a brand new movie. In Scottsdale. 

If my 3D glasses were clean, instant 5 star. 4.5 as it was."}
{"text":"Now this is the way to do a movie theater. Hip, Cool, Trendy layout, cool bar. And the seating, feels just like a Lazyboy! Super cute smiley staff. The only downer was the movie I saw, Apollo 18, go see something else and you will have a great time."}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE IPIC Theaters. Although we live in Vegas we frequently travel to Scottsdale to enjoy movies in their luxury theater as we have yet to find any other that can compare. When you walk in, it's like you're going into a high end night club. Initially you are greeted by a hostess who prints your tickets and answers any questions you may have. To left is a full bar with plenty of seating & televisions and to the right
there is the snack bar as well as the restaurant Tanzy. 

The theaters have both Premium & Premium Plus seats. We always get the Premium Plus - reclining plush seating, pillow, blanket, free popcorn as well as 
in-movie service so you can order food and/or drinks throughout the movie. There is a full drink and food menu that include red velvet bread pudding--YUM!!! 

The servers are always polite, food is excellent and the experience is unmatched."}
{"text":"Extremely expensive! We went to watch Jack Reacher ... tickets are $17!!! And that's the lower level tickets that don't include waiter service for food! Though it's a good theatre experience, it's ridiculously overpriced!"}
{"text":"I definitely like the idea of being able to drink a beer while watching a movie....but a $6 beer! You have got to be kidding me! Thankfully we went on a Tuesday night and the beers and appetizers were half priced. 

This place definitely looks really cool. It has a really nice hip lounge area with a bar where you can grab a few drinks before going in for you movie. The actual theater is decent. I like that is smaller and the seats are big, but if you are not sitting in the gold seats, then they can be pretty stiff as they don't recline. Also, I heard the women's bathroom is fantastic, but I didn't get a chance to check it out personally. 

This place had potential to be cool, but they had to go off and \"scottsdalize\" it. That is a technical term I just made up for taking something that could be cool and turning it into a stuffy, overpriced place, where people stare at you if you pull up in a Toyota. The servers in the bars were dressed like they worked at a casino in Vegas! Um hello, we live in Arizona, and this is just a movie theater. 

If you want to pay $20 a ticket plus more for food and beer then iPic is your place, if not, steer clear!"}
{"text":"They need to fix some things. The service is very poor. The website is confusing. 

I went there on a Sunday night so I don't know if it ever gets crowded, but it does seem like the non gold class seats are not much in demand. 

The gold class seat do recline, but if you are taller than 5' 9\", expect your feet to cramp up against the mini walls in front of you. Worse, if you are the unfortunate person sitting in front of a tall person, expect to have the smell of their socks inches above your head. (We moved seats. It was too much.) For this reason alone, I would only go back if I could guarantee the front row of the gold class which does not have a row directly behind it. Instead it has the server staging area.

Still, I gave it 4 stars because it DOES have potential. Let's work on that service, folks. Get a manager in there who emphasizes to his staff that it's supposed to be first class not steerage."}
{"text":"We went to iPic for the first time yesterday as a surprise birthday gift for my husband. iPic did not disappoint. 

This is not your run-of-the-mill theatre... This is a true cinematic experience. The theatre is pristine and radiates glamour and comfort. The service is comparable to an upscale restaurant. You never have to worry about anything. 

I strongly recommend visiting the iPic if you can... It's an unbelievable experience."}
{"text":"The theatre is beautiful and the premium plus tickets are definitely the way to go if you decide to visit. $25 a ticket is kind of expensive to watch a movie though in my opinion. The premium plus seats are pretty comfortable and I really enjoyed watching a movie, but I don't plan to make this my go to theatre for every movie I want to watch at the theatre. I would probably come every once in awhile - like twice a year....because I'm so cheap."}
{"text":"I have done my fair share of traveling but have never been to a theater like this. From the food to the service everything is perfect. What a great way to relax. Worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Great experience, very comfortable but could have been better. The 3D glasses they use are electronic, and they can be dodgy at times. My friend and I both had to exchange ours for new ones partway through the film and that was pretty frustrating.

Their seats are the best there is for movie theaters, bar none. But I think I had a better experience overall at the AMC esplanade because the interaction and experience is a little different. For instance at iPic, the wait staff comes to you several times throughout the film, and it is actually quite disruptive; in addition, when you actually need something and want them to come to you, you need to wait or get up yourself (which is what you'd have to do at typical theatres, but still.) Esplanade has a button you can press to summon the wait staff instead, so you can interact when it is convenient for you to do so and if you need something you can let them know straight away.

Maybe I wouldn't be a little bitter about it if I wasn't interrupted during the climax of the film to sign the check for our dinner. Could it really not have waited another fifteen minutes? I know you need to get paid and don't want to let people leave without doing so, but it was a little obnoxious, there has to be a better way.

I was intrigued also to see the wine vending machine in the lobby, it was something I'd never seen before, but I was immediately disenchanted by the inconvenient paying process (you have to use your credit card or cash to buy a \"wine card\" and then use the \"wine card\" to buy the wine from the machine...this is probably for age verification so I'll let that slide) and then all the prices are absurdly high and none of them end in even dollars, so count on having wasted money leftover on your \"wine card\".

All in all I did have a really great time, and iPic is worlds beyond the experience you get at a normal theater, but I think I prefer the other dinner theater options available in the valley. Not that I wouldn't return, it just wasn't the perfect night I was told I'd experience."}
{"text":"A+++++

It's expensive but well worth the VIP luxury experience you get. Everything is beautiful and the customer service is superb. I can't say enough great things about iPic. I'm a regular. We just saw The Hunger Games there last week. Hubby ordered the filet mignon sliders and a margarita. I had the mahi mahi street tacos and the rose champagne.  All phenomenal. Our server was quick and attentive and very warm and friendly. We had the creme brulee cheesecake for desert, which was amazing, and timed perfectly so we could eat it as we enjoyed the ending of our movie.

Upgrade to premium plus (become an iPic member to save some money) - you get the best seating in the theater, pillow, blanket, free popcorn and valet. Awesome.

This is the best movie theater ever."}
{"text":"I set my expectations too high.  2 tickets with a membership were close to $50.  A few drinks before the movie were another $40.  We were allowed into the theater 5 minutes before the movie was scheduled to start.  It was just enough time to order another drink and some food.  At this point everything seemed to be going ok, until I sat back in my seat.

THE SEAT I SAT IN HAD A RESTRICTED VIEW.  The railing for the stairs was blocking the bottom left 10% of the screen.  This was incredibly annoying during a 3D movie.  I had to watch the movie while leaning on my side.  It was extremely uncomfortable."}
{"text":"I LOVE iPIC. I love everything about this joint.  I love the SQ - I love all the people walking around - the shops - the atmosphere.  The restrooms both in and out of the theatre.  It's amazing.  I've told a dozen or more friends and family and will continue to rave about the experiences.  It's just wonderful.  Friday night we went to see Dom, Brian and the gang.  It was pure excitement for me.  We got there early as it suggests that you do and I just like the whole experience.  We got there and printed out our tiks and proceeded to the lounge area.  The music from the bar and just lighting and pretty people is so much fun.  We looked over and on our last visit noticed these new little contraptions over in the concession area.  We watched a guy take his wine glass and get what looked like a shot pour into his glass.  What the???  So I was instantly curious.  Hubby went over and checked it out.  Probably a dozen or more wines in the dispenser.  Everything from white to red and everything in between.  Glasses located on the bottom of the dispensery.  I wanted to try it and was wanting a cocktail anyway and we had time to burn so why not.  I went over with my debit card and started to have a look.  You can purchase a quarter, half or I think 3/4 amounts.  And they range from $1.68 (for a 1/4) and up.  Each wine costs different amounts.  So I continued to browse and when I was just about ready and kid came over and said ma'am (grrrr) these machines don't take regular debit cards - you'll have to go and get a wine card from the concession.  Oh ok.  No worries.  Get in line go get a card and they have a minimum of $10 no big deal.  Did that.  Went over and perused both machines.  Decided on two and went back over to the hubby and enjoyed our glasses of wine.  We finished those and went back for more.  It's kinda fun.  The helpers are a teensy annoying they tend to follow you around the machines but I'm guessing they are just doing their jobs.  

It was time for us to be seated.  Vin was waiting!!  We walked into the theater just like I remembered it.  So nice and relaxing.  We were seated and Jake came over right away and told us he would be taking care of us for the night.  What a guy!  Seriously, see whatever movie Jake is working in for the night.  He is attentive, relaxed, on it just a great employee.  After this review I'm calling to speak with the manager and rave.  Good service makes the experience all the better.  He was GREAT.  SUPERB.  Hubby ordered the brownie trifecta and I got the creme brulee cheesecake.  Good lord.  IT was fantastic.  It's still hard to eat in the dark and if you are on a date and don't realize that you spill something - it just gives you a good reason to experience the WONDERFUL restrooms.  The whole room is fantastic.  It's so AWESOME.  I love this place.  I wouldnt mind going every weekend. It's just that awesome.  I'm kinda pissed I never had the idea.  Go to iPIC, make sure Jake takes care of you and dont forget to get a glass of wine."}
{"text":"This place is off the hook! It is so definately worth the few extra dollars for the few hours of luxury...and to be pampered and waited on while watching a movie.

We indulged in the automatic wine dispensers in the lobby. They were offering wine tasting/sampling prior to purchasing.

We ordered dessert off the menu (oreo ice cream cake). We had dinner at the TKs Urban Tavern here in the Scottsdale Quarter (separate review).

The chairs are so comfortable... pillows and blankets are a nice plus.

It was a great indulgence!

As other reviewers here have stated... this is a nice once in a while date night out."}
{"text":"Ehh. I don't have it in me to rate in lower than a 3 but I feel like I want to.  Service was fine, we only ordered a water so we didn't put them to the test. Theatre was clean, people were nice, etc. I'm just completely underwhelmed by what you get for the price. 

First why would you call a mandatory fee a fee rather than just call it what it is... a $27 movie ticket. It is not a $17 ticket with a $10 fee. 

Look, almost every movie theatre out there has reclining seats and reserved seating. That might have been special a few years ago but now it's just normal. 

I certainly appreciate the popcorn thrown in but even with excessive concessions pricing that is a $5-$7 retail value. 

I want to focus here on the fact that the people where kind, the theatre was beautiful, and the movie going experience was exactly what I would expect from every single movie theatre I've been to in the last 5 years. The only difference is that I paid more than 2x for that experience versus what I feel like I should."}
{"text":"What an enjoyable way to have dinner and a movie. The experience was heightened by the lovely atmosphere and the more than attentive service. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I really think this is the best movie theater experience I have had since seeing U2360 3d on Imax.

My lady and I went and saw Something Borrowed. The movie itself was eh, but I really did not care.

I got 2 tickets for $25 a piece, which included waiter service and a full menu. Complimentary popcorn is included as well as reclining sofa chairs, and pillows, and soft blankets.  Thought it was an awesome experience.  

The food cost is separate and it is restaurant prices. We had a flatbread BBQ shortrib pizza like thing and it was good.  We actually ordered food before we went in, and I am thinking that we should have just ordered food right from our seats.  

Still a GREAT experience and a great date idea.

We went to Tanzy which is right next to the place and found that to be a great appetizer experience with an open air setting.  We also hung around Salt was well which is connected to the Theater.

Great experience. Cant wait to do it again."}
{"text":"pros
beautiful like a night club
delicious food
wine and beer
servers
recliner seats
blankets
you can reserve seats b4 show

cons
way expensive like $80 for 2 ppl with food
screen not so impressive
sound not that great
good seats cost extra

kind of like a normal ok theatre but with great food and drinks for a really expensive price, cool to go to at least once b/c it makes you feel pampered"}
{"text":"Recliners, food, and a movie? Aside from being pricey, what's not to like?
The recliners are comfortable. If you order food, it can be tricky to find room to set it all down somewhere. You are offered a pillow and even a blanket (why?), which is a nice touch. Free popcorn.
There's a bar area when you first walk in, and everything inside is clean and well-maintained.
You pay for the experience - its not cheap here! But for a special occasion or if you've never been, its definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Bought premium plus seats at $25.00 per ticket for a 4:00 pm movie.  Theater was not empty but in no way crowded.  Service was awful.  Drinks took much longer than necessary.  Our food order was not delivered until we asked about it - about 1/2 way through the movie.  When it was delivered only 1/2 of the order was delivered.      They eventually did deliver a second dinner but it was wrong.  On the up side, they comped the wrong dinner.  Venue, seats, service are under par for the price.  Will not return."}
{"text":"I had complaints about other theaters.. not enough room, too loud etc.  I found this place after a referral from my husbands friend.  Now we go all the time and we love it.  Pricey but well worth the experience.  we both love being spoiled.  Makes it hard to go to any other theater. nothing compares.  I love the recliner, the pillow, blanket, the sound the room, comfort and having a waiter bring you great things to eat while you watch.  Also there is valet, free too! IM a fan for LIFE"}
{"text":"Loveeeeee this theater! Once you start coming here it will be hard to go back to a Harkins ever again. The key is to join the FREE rewards program on their website so the prices go down a little. We went last night to see Star Wars & didn't get tickets early enough so we had to sit down at the lower level seats that don't recline :( they were OK, I wasn't nearly as comfortable as I wanted to be, but for that one movie, I will be ok. So make sure to get the recliner chairs up top, comes with free popcorn and water. I always get a glass of wine & my boyfriend a beer. They used to have drink specials on Tuesday but yesterday we found out that they no longer do that, boo."}
{"text":"My husband and I watched BOSS in premium VIP seating on Friday April 8th 2016 at 2:15. We ordered some food and drinks so my total bill was $85. I gave the attendent a $100 bill and she never returned with the change. I waited for her until the movie ended but she never came back. I was going to give her a tip, but she must have assumed herself that the change was her tip. I can't believe she did that. She didn't even ask if we wanted the change, she just took the folder and never came back. It is proper customer service to bring the change back and then we would leave the tip. Hopefully next time we don't have the same person!!! I would have rated higher but the attendent brought down the experience. It's not about the money, it's about the principle!!!"}
{"text":"I did not want to like this place. $25.00 for a movie ticket seemed like a scam. Then I finally gave in and tried iPic now I'm  hooked. It is like watching a movie in a super nice house all whilst having a butler wait on you. I would highly recommend upgrading to the premium plus seating which would be rows E and back. Also, seats 5 and 6 are in the center of the theater. The theaters are small compared to Harkens or AMC. The concession prices are similar to what you would find at a normal theater. The seats are enormous, the blankets are clean and soft and the entire theater is immaculately clean. The employees were extremely friendly and helpful. The premium plus seating comes with free popcorn and a recliner, again, I can't recommend these seats enough. iPic made going to the movies feel like an experience rather than just seeing a show. I don't know that I will go to another theater."}
{"text":"Oh, iPic, how I love thee! Whether you're sitting in Premium seats (leather armchairs) or Premium Plus (leather recliners w/ all the amenities), it's THE best way to see a movie. Probably not the type of theater you'd go see a movie EVERY time because it'd get a little expensive :-) But on a date night or for a kickass movie you've been waiting to see, this is the place! I'm all about springing for the Premium Plus seats...the difference in cost is worth it for all the perks you get: comped valet parking, free popcorn, reclining seat, blanket & pillow, and wait service. Sign up to be a member and you get a small discount on tickets and a gift card after earning so many points."}
{"text":"The place is wonderful. The workers have a nice additude and always care. The auditoriums are big and the seats are extremely comfortable. A little more expensive then regular theatres, but WAY worth it."}
{"text":"Great way to see a movie.  P

Pros:  comfy seats, great pic quality, great sound, friendly server, validate parking

Cons:  overpriced like all show food and so-so quality.  Had 1 blue moon beer, one glass pinot, one tub of popcorn and trio dip appetizer and it was $50 with tip.   Seriously, $14.95 for a glass of pinot, got a dirty wine glass at first.   Ewwwwww, so dark you can't see anything, i just happened to hold it up to light.  Watch your bill as we both had errors on them, and again, so dark, gotta really double check.  

Tip:  go see a 3d show here and save drinks and food for somewhere else!!!"}
{"text":"UPDATE*****

I spoke with Anthony the senior manager and I have to say he did everything he could to make our next experience better. 
We went today and had a great server, Jessica, she was really on top of our waters and everything. 
This is the experience we normally expect and were happy to have it again! 


Original Review *** 


Wow! What a HORRIBLE HORRIBLE CHAOTIC experience. I can honestly say I will not be referring anyone here anymore. 

We went last Friday night for a movie and we were so excited to try the new chaise chairs since they remodeled. To be fair, they did tell us the seats are close to the screen, and boy were they right! We were the first row! But that wasn't the issue. 

We got there 20 minutes early before the previews. We pressed the server button and it took the server about 10 minutes to get to us, fine, we ordered 2 waters. I requested we received the water in a plastic container instead of the glass cup it normally comes in. We placed the order right away as we knew what we wanted to eat. He asked us how we would like to pay and we told him we wanted to pay with cash. 
My brother and sister in law with us, also ordered water and lemonade and gave their card. 
We ended up getting our popcorn, it took them so long to bring us the drinks we finished our popcorn with no water!!! It took 45 minutes for us to get waters! WATERS! And then they mixed up who got the lemonade and never brought the water in the plastic container as I had asked. 
Our food came out 1 hour and 20 minutes after we placed the order!! So you think wow that's horrible it has to end there, NOPE! 
The movie actually finished, (they normally come 30 minutes before the ending so we could pay) , again movie finished and we were looking around for the server to pay. 

We were paying cash, our server never even paid attention to us, we honestly could have walked out without paying and no one would have noticed! 
My brother in law never received his credit card yet however, so we waited for the server. Finally the guy comes to us and asks us if we had the gift card, uh no we were paying cash, and he gave us the bill. Then he goes to my brother in law and goes uh you had the visa right, no, no he did not have the visa. He had to dig through 5 different cards to get my brother in law's card.  Now back to us, We needed change for the bill. We followed the guy outside and he looked at us and booked it, he disappeared on us. We stood outside the theater near a register waiting for another server to finish. As we finish, the girl server sees how frustrated we are she let's know she was very frustrated with management too. She said that they were very short staffed and that was causing problems with service. She brought us up the front desk, apologized to us and told us the front desk would give us change and help us settle the bill. 
The front desk guy asked us how our experience was and we told him it was horrible. We then told him we just wanted to pay our bill and leave. He said he can only give us change not cash us out. Talk about being exasperated. We got the change, had to find ANOTHER server and just get the hell out. My brother in law actually complained to a manger and was just brushed aside. 

I have always been an IPIC fan and have told a lot of people about coming out here but I will not be doing that anymore. I am so upset, dissatisfied and disappointed. We also got a survey in our email about our experience and left the review and never got contacted. Very frustrating"}
{"text":"Not worth the money. The place looks cool. The staff were great. The reclining seats were uncomfortable and the food was sent back. Will stick to AMC and a local restaurant."}
{"text":"Whenever we see an iPic we have to visit since we be movie people. Called the theater and bought out tickets over the phone, my app wasn't working. Arrived and picked up the tickets without issue. Great seats and we both ordered cocktails and the Angus Trio sliders. Very tasty, great fast service. Overall what IPic is supposed to be."}
{"text":"This was my first time at an iPic and my expectations were high.  I had heard great things about iPic theaters at other locations.  I booked my tickets online and paid the premium for VIP tickets that included popcorn, reclining seats, and a pillow/blanket.  The ticket is significantly more than other theaters in the area, $17 before the $10 VIP charge.  The lobby area was luxurious and clean and the bar looked like a great place for drinks and conversation.  We got to our seats about 15 minutes before the movie started.  This is when our experience suffered.  The seats were disgustingly dirty and one was completely torn (see the attached pics).  The seat fabric is a red microfiber which might be why they looked so dirty.  There were multiple stains.  We covered the torn seat cushion and decided to cover it with the provided blanket, which also didn't appear to be clean.  We did finally settle into our seats and began looking over the menu.  The menu was also dirty and sticky.  The food and drink offerings looked decent, but nothing caught our eye.  The waiter quickly approached us and introduced himself, he was friendly and attentive.  My only complaint about the service was that there was no way to request service during the movie other than to catch the waiter's eye/attention...no button or light like many other theaters offer.  The free popcorn arrived right before the movie started.  It was typical movie popcorn, nothing special but not bad.  We saw a 3D movie and both of our provided glasses were dirty and covered in fingerprints and what I would assume is popcorn oil.  We had to clean them ourselves.  As the movie started, I noticed that everything looked very blurry.  For whatever reason my glasses did not work.  Luckily the seat next to us was empty and we tried those glasses, which worked.  The movie itself was great, however the theater experience was sub-par for ANY theater, let alone an iPic that brags about being such an amazing experience.   We will not be returning to iPic again.  There are other theaters in the area, like Roadhouse Cinema, that offer a better, cleaner experience with a better food menu than iPic; and for a lot less money."}
{"text":"I am giving it three for the following reasons:
Total bill for two adults who were not quite drunk:$140.
Food eaten in dark and leftovers not offered (so, what exactly did we eat?)
Chairs comfortable but no room to set plate

The free popcorn was good. (Free-he he)

I guess if I was Bill Gates I would come here all the time with my extended family. No, wait, I would buy the place. I am a simple gal, this was over the top but I did notice many fathers on their visitation day watching movies with their kids. Whatever happened to the matinee and sneaking a sandwich in to teach about the value of a dollar? Just saying..."}
{"text":"Avoid Ipic unless you have super premium seats.  Food isn't very good and with just the premium seats you have to order, wait for food and then hustle to your table.  If you want food and a movie, go to the other Scottsdale food movie place - much better, less expensive and great service."}
{"text":"This is a great place to see a movie. It's definitely more expensive than a regular movie; if you get the nice, reclining seats you are talking $28 a ticket, but you get free popcorn and water which would otherwise cost you at least $10 at a regular theatre.  Outside of the price, it really is an excellent movie going experience."}
{"text":"I've been to the iPic twice now - once with family to see \"Jack Reacher\" and the second time for a Yelp Event to see \"Jobs\". Both experiences were one of a kind and a unique movie experience. 

The iPic is located in the heart of the Scottsdale Quarter. It is upstairs, so look for the stairs/escalator going up near True Foods. Once on the second level, it is next to Tanzy. The actual iPic has a bar called Salt and on the other end, it is connected to Tanzy. It's nice that you can get a drink or some food before the movie, then once inside you can order off the menu for more drinks/food. 

Premium seating is the way to go - you get a pillow, a blanket, and the seat is super plush/comfy and reclines. This is the movie theater you want to go to for a 3 hour movie or when your date insists on a movie you don't want to see (you can take a nap!). I would highly recommend this theater in these types of situations. Otherwise, it can be a little pricey. (Regular seating is $18 and premium is $21 or $25.) If you sign up with them as a member, you can get preferred seating and a slight discount. 

Overall, seeing a movie at the iPic is something you have to do at least once!"}
{"text":"We've been coming here for about 4 years with no problems until the last two times.  It is showing wear. Today's visit: stinky dirty chairs. Left over food stains, and the worst; it smelled like greasy head sweat  in the seats! I had to change clothes when I got home.  Nasty.  I  heard Desert Ridge has similar.  Going there for cheaper and better."}
{"text":"This theatre is absolutely beautiful. Once you watch a movie here, any other theatre seems chinky ;) Since I go there frequently, I'd like there to be more items on the in menu dining...it's been the same stuff for ever it seems- they could spice that up

other than that the waiters are great, chairs comfortable, etc. A+! :0)"}
{"text":"I remember when iPic first opened in Scottsdale back in 2010. It was kind of a big deal back then, as the whole dine-in theater concept hadn't yet become commonplace.

I don't go to the theater very often these days, as I've always had a difficult time sitting for two-plus hours in uncomfortable seats with very little stretch room. This is where iPic has its advantages.

If you're willing to plop down 25 dollars, you can sit in one of their Premium Plus seats. They recline back, offer plenty of room to stretch out, while also providing you with a blanket and pillow. In many ways, it's very close to the comfort of watching a movie at home. The fact that you can reserve your seats in your preferred area beforehand is another bonus.

I can't say much about the food. Several years ago, my girlfriend and I dined at their Tanzy restaurant and due to a kitchen mishap, the food was very late and had to be served to us while watching the movie. As for the actual iPic offerings? Well, it's better than what you'd get at a regular theater, but I'm usually more than satisfied with their complimentary popcorn and a soda.

The theaters are small and remind me of what you'd go to if you were to attend a private screening. Projectors are decent and sound, while not earth-shattering like IMAX, is good enough for most people.

I'm not sure if I'd ever visit here regularly due to the higher prices, but on those rare occasions that I am in the mood to see a movie outside the house and IMAX isn't an option, comfort is key.

Recommended!"}
{"text":"An update to my review posted on 12/23/12:  Since posting my review, I have been extremely impressed with the management and customer service provided by iPic Theaters in Scottsdale.  Not only did Karen, the customer service representative, contact me almost immediately to inquire more about our experience and how iPic could remedy our issues, but Lawrence, the manager of that iPic location, called me numerous times (until we finally connected).  Their persistence in contacting me and Lawrence's generous offer to make up for our poor experience the next time we visit an iPic, should we decide to (which we will), was just outstanding.  

Lawrence went above and beyond, and his response to remedy our mediocre experience is what everyone should expect from managers of any type of establishment, should service not meet expectations.  I am looking forward to going back to iPic next time we are in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"iPic is swanky. It's like a Vegas nightclub inside. You feel like a VIP, and you're within striking distance of the Kierland Cougars. Young, single men...This is where you should be to find a Sugar Mama. When I first saw a movie here, I thought it was the best possible movie going experience. Tickets were between $19-21, but it was such an awesome place that I thought it was worth it.

Here's the thing. The nice seats that recline and come with personal service are now $27 a piece. For $27, I can go to a Diamonbacks game, a Suns game, a concert, a show at ASU Gammage...There's a lot I can do for $27. Two people going to a movie, getting a drink and a bite to eat at iPic will run $100, easy. You can become a member which lowers the price of their expensive seats to $20, but that's only valid certain nights of the week. On the weekends? Even members are paying $27 a pop.

For me? It's not worth it. There's another place in the area that has larger theatres with better seats, more separation from people around you, more room to stretch your legs (I'm 6'3\" and my feet hit the half wall in front of the chair when I'm fully reclined at iPic), personal service, a full bar and good food...Tickets are $12-15, and that's become my go to theatre in the Phoenix area. 

iPic has cheaper seats, but they don't move or recline, and you don't get the chance to have food/drinks brought to you. For the real experience, you've got to shell out the cash. 

The service is alright. I ordered a soda that wasn't refilled at all and we placed an order for a dessert that never came (luckily we weren't charged for it). 

If people are seeing a movie at iPic, I'll tag along. It's still a really nice theatre, and there are some cool perks like free popcorn and a blanket (apparently they're washed regularly), but it's no longer at the top of my list for best places to see a movie.

4 star experience, 0 star price point."}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan of going to the movies because typically the seats are super uncomfortable, the snack bars are mediocre at best and lets be honest sometimes it's awesome to have a cocktail while watching a movie; with that being said It's hard to not feel totally spoiled when watching a movie at iPic! 

Service is always great, the staff go above an beyond the call of duty... They have some awesome food and drink choices (personally, I am obsessed with their blood orange margarita!). But seriously, it's their seats that are the real show stopper, if you decide to go all out and get the premium plus seats, you are getting huge comfortable reclining seats that come provided with blankets and popcorn! Its worth the splurge in my opinion! 

It truly is an unforgettable movie-going experience. If you've never been, just do it. You'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"What a great experience! First time and it was definitely worth the extra dollars for premium seats. So relaxing. Great place to visit!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Comfort of a movie with outstanding food and drink. The service is amazing, and quality of food is LEGIT! Perfect for a date night, or some alone time. We have had great service every time. We travel form out of of town, and this IPIC is top on our list while visiting Scottsdale."}
{"text":"The reclining seats dont actually recline which sucks. The foot rest simply extends. As a larger Male the seats are clearly taking the airplane approach make em as small as possible and herd people in like cattle. Lots of back pain during the movie and 0 neck support. Theres no headrest in the chairs. Theres something at the top of the chair but I took a spare blanket and used that as a head rest. Good drinks good food. Good picture good sound. Service is slow but its teenagers so... I moved slow when I was a teenager too"}
{"text":"If you like going to the movies this place is top of the line.. We booked our RECLINING SEATS online yes I said they have full blown recliners !! We had dinner and a movie in 2 hours my wife even fell asleep after dinner !! Its awesome to do dinner and a movie in two hours as it saves on $$$ we spend on a sitter for the kids !! PERFECT DATE NIGHT !!!"}
{"text":"I ordered our tickets online, but what really happens when you get there, they charge your credit card  and you sign the credit slip there and receive your tickets.
The seats where really huge and I couldn't reach the floor. When I reclined, I could sense the feet from the people behind me. We occupied two seats on the right side, premium area. You would think that they would have a tray to go between us...nope...we had separate swing out tables. 
The sound system was excellent and the popcorn was okay. This is something that I would do every once in a while. If there is a movie that you really want to see, this is the place to reserve your seat."}
{"text":"Live that you can reserve seats. I will only go to this theater or the AMC Esplanade on Camelback. 
The food is a little better at the Esplanade but there are better places to grab a quick bite and the seats are more comfortable at the Scottsdale Quarter (Ipic)."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous. And by ridiculous I mean, I want to live in one of the theatres. Recliner seats, free popcorn, a fluffy blanket, and a pillow? This is a movie experience built around the comforts of home, plus luxury, which every girl date needs when watching Jamie Foxx shoot the bloody crap out of cowboys, care of Quentin Tarantino. 

While we were perusing the menu, our waitress told us that the food ordered will be coming from Tanzy Express, so Angy B. decided to spring for the Death by Chocolate cake (\"We're celebrating!\" she said. \"Stop twisting my arm!\" I choked out). Just as the movie started, our waters came out, later was the complimentary popcorn, AND FINALLY THE CAKE. The heavens opened up and we accepted our fate. So chocolatey, so good. I don't even like frosting, but that couldn't have been frosting... maybe more of a ganache? Because I loved it. It also had some sort of cream dollop at one side of it that we couldn't get enough of. HIGHLY recommended. 

This place isn't cheap, but it is certainly the kind of place you take a date you want to impress. I wish there was a way to get a waiter's attention between services, though. What if we decided to get a glass of red to accompany our cake? Or even just a refill on our waters. Other than that, I'll certainly be back with Husband."}
{"text":"In the words of Peter Griffin on the topic of the movie The Godfather, this place \"insist upon itself\". 

The idea of this place is epic, you can eat and drink while you watch a new release film, I know they aren't the first to do it, but it's my first experience. Everything about this place it top of the line. Beautiful decor, nicely dressed employees instead of the oil stained shirt and bow tie uniform at AMC, but this place is so pretentious it almost couldn't stand it. 

We were lucky enough to get free tickets and a deal that had half price beers and appetizers (which meant that they were normal priced anywhere else), otherwise it could have easily been $50+. The theaters themselves are very nice with huge seats, each with their own swivel table, the only draw back from them is that they aren't adjustable at all. 

I don't know, I guess I just think this place is trying to hard to be something other than a movie theater. I think if they just had a good bar with a decent snack bar then I would love it more, I just don't see my self coming close to planning a movie here unless its at come kind of discount."}
{"text":"We arrived at our seats 30 minutes prior to the start of the movie. We got off to a great start with our server bringing us blanket and pillow. She also brought menus and took our drink order. When she returned with our drink order, we placed our food order. We still had 20 minutes until the lights were going off. A full 10 minutes into the trailers our food arrived, my husband's sliders were great ( even 30 minutes after ordering) my nachos were ice cold. We waited for a server and for almost 10 minutes I sat with the cold nachos on my tray until another server was bringing popcorn around and we asked to speak with our server. She took the nachos, at this point I was irritated and no longer wanted them. When she brought the  check, I asked for more popcorn, almost 15 minutes later, she returned with the popcorn and said she forgot.
The seats wer very comfortable, but skip the food unless you bring it yourself from the concession stand."}
{"text":"I am blown away by the electric seats and service. What a wonderful experience and memory with son watching star wars! First class all the way and no issue  paying $14 for an ale.  Look forward to next memory.   Had an amazing time!"}
{"text":"The food was ice cold, popcorn, pretzels, pretzel dip! The wine list changed and we ordered two different reds and they were the same peppery mess. Also don't think about being in a group of 3 cuz there is a plastic divider between the seats! It doesn't fold up, so one of you will be isolated. And you can't even eat your feelings because the food is so terrible. No thank you,g'byeeee"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this place. I was pretty excited until I got to my seat.. I sat in the lower section since the upper section was booked. Seat was fine until I put my arm on the arm rest.  The thing was broke so the entire movie I had no arm rest. Spent most my time trying to balance my arm on this thing!! Made for a long movie!! I mentioned it to management and they said they would reimburse me but they never did. No big deal but Just goes to show they don't care about there customers .. I won't be back. Harkins or AMC is way better! ZERO STARS!!"}
{"text":"03/07/13

While I immediately signed up for the free loyalty account online in July 2010, this was my first time watching a movie here.  I could kick myself for waiting all this time to find out what all the fuss was about!  I entered the theater lobby through the Tanzy entrance, so I passed the concession stand to my right and the wrap-around couch with the wine kiosk to my left to get to the \"box office\" to redeem one of my  premium plus seating passes I received at the Yelp Elite event held at Tanzy back in December.  (Yes, they were inside those delightful gift bags that very fortunate Yelp Elite members get to take home after having such a wonderful time at these events!)  I was going for the 7p Thursday showing of \"Jack, the Giant Slayer**,\" so besides the couple that arrived before me, and who were being taken care of by a clerk, I was the only one waiting in line, and I didn't have to wait very long.  While it was nice not to have to wait for more than a minute, or two, I can see how these lines could get very long and tiresome during peak times, so I suggest you book your tickets online, or via mobile-- not only to avoid waiting in long lines (since there's only room for two clerks to wait on people), but to make sure you can select the seats you want!  I've been to Ultra Star and Studio Movie Grill before, so I was familiar with the seat selection process, but if you've never been to either of these theaters, then visiting for the first time with only a few minutes to get through the ticketing process before the movie starts might make the whole experience a little stressful.  Be wise, and take some time now to check out www.ipic.com and familiarize yourself with the theater to maximize your theater enjoyment!  :)  

After greeting me a warm welcome and asking me if I've ever been there before, I answered with a \"no, she then asked me for my surname.  (Btw, everyone here is so friendly, before, during, and after the movie!)  After giving her my name, I was reminded that I did sign up for the loyalty program a few years ago, which then gave me a little jump seeing how long this theater has been open!  Soon after this process and with ticket in hand, I found my way to auditorium #3 and quickly located my luxury seat.  Oh, my goodness!  I knew already that this was quickly going to be one of my favorite theater venues, and after settling down onto my seat and handed my free popcorn and 3D glasses, and my request for a glass of water, I knew that I was in for a terrific treat!  And then, the 3D trailers started to play... OH, BOY!  :)

$17 for premium plus seating, with no price difference between regular and 3D films, is a gorgeous steal when you consider everything you're getting in return: free popcorn (for you popcorn lovers), a pillow, a lux blanket, AND a seat with a button that, upon depressing, raises your legs so that you're able to recline as if laying down in a first-class airplane cabin.  The 3D glasses I received provided me the BEST 3D movie experience outside of 3D IMAX ($18.75 for \"Avatar\" at Harkins Arizona Mills) and a 4D Immersion experience (an additional $5 for a 15-, or 20-minute film per person with an admission ticket to Baltimore's National Aquarium).  Most theaters charge at least $13 for a 3D experience that, at least for me, can be a hit-or-miss, and then, for those who absolutely need it at the movies, a small bag of popcorn, which can cost you at least $3 elsewhere, so add another $1, you get a personal bed, complete with a pillow and blanket, and the chance to enjoy a 3D film with what must be state-of-the-art 3D glasses!  (I so wished I saw \"Life of Pi\" 3D here...)

From the moment the trailers began, I had a feeling I found THE place I'm going to watch 3D \"at the movies\" from now on-- at iPic!  And after taking a quick look at the cocktails menu, I know what I'm going to try on my next visit, which I will dutifully post a photo of, and it will be very soon, so stay tuned!  :)

p.s.  Free valet with your paid, or gifted, premium plus ticket!  

** Great movie, considering everything you've read of the children's classic fable, and for all of the special effects, the only way to see them, at least for me, is multi-dimensional!  I'm looking forward to seeing more 3D films here."}
{"text":"I'm bumping them up to 5 Stars. This is, literally, the ONLY place we go when we want to see a movie. I have problems sitting too long at one time, so this is the place for me.
Bumping it up to 5 Stars because I see they've added to their menu - I'd suggest they add to their menu as they do their monthly specials and find out what interests us. I appreciate the wider selections that they have on the menu now (AND, even decent sounding dessert items now, too!!!)"}
{"text":"Premium plus is the way to go!  The seats are amazing, the food is great and the service is awesome. I would say its a bit expensive, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"The nicest movie theater I have ever been to, I thought I was in a club and everyone dressed the part.  The cost was pricey...I would not take the kids to a movie here but it is a great date night.  I paid for regular seats online and got to pick my seat.  We bought the steak sliders and cheese pizza and both were really good.  I dropped about $30 on the food and then another $30 on a glass of wine and a tall/double jack and coke.  It is Scottsdale night club prices but also Scottsdale night club atmosphere.  I have to say I liked having this option to spoil my wife and enjoy a nice movie with great comfortable seats and great service.  If I had to complain about something it would be the bathrooms...they are to small and there was a line the 2 times I went."}
{"text":"Love this theater! Can't get more comfortable or convenient when it comes to pressing a button and food/drinks just magically appearing ... well not entirely magical as it does come at a price ... I think it is a bit too over priced but worth it for a treat now and again. The seats in both areas (full service and regular seats) are extremely comfortable and make it hard to imagine sitting in a regular theater again!"}
{"text":"I LOVED this theatre. So upscale. It makes a movie date special again! There is a separate bar if you feel like hanging out after. I feel like this place would be perfect for a first date. Now to the chairs, they are the most comfortable out of any upscale theatre I've been do. They recline quite a bit and are big and soft. Plenty of room between you and the next person. Free popcorn with the luxury seats. I tried the truffle fries and the 50 shades of green juice and enjoyed both a lot.  The green juice is lite similar to true food refreshers. The truffle fries aren't crunchy but I like that, I wish they gave me more ketchup with them because asking for extra wasn't convenient when I'm the middle of the row and immersed in the movie. My one complaint was the kids sitting next to me! The parents were and the end of the row 2 seats down from their children not Paying any attention to them and their kids were directly next to me! Two kids in one seat continuously reclining the seat and putting it back up with their cell phone flashlight on disrupting everyone in the vicinity. Someone asked me to tell them to stop and they weren't even my kids! This is not fault of the theatre though just bad parenting."}
{"text":"My first visit to this theater.  Very posh, luxury.  We spent $100.00 for a movie and desert.  The popcorn is average, nothing special.  They :serve food and drinks right to your seat, but good luck getting the server to come back after the first time.  
Super ecpensive, not worth it.  I won't be back.  Its overrated ...."}
{"text":"God I wish they had one here in boring Tucson:( This place is the best thing EVER!!! The service at Tanzy was amazing. Our server was also fantastic!"}
{"text":"Defiantly a different experience. It was by far the fanciest movie theater I have ever been too. The amenities are much more extravagant then a regular movie theater would offer. 

Price, it is defiantly expensive. I signed up for the free membership which gives you $2 off each seat, but still pricey. The food, snacks, and drinks are all pricey as well. The food from the snack bar was decent but I would have preferred to try one of the restaurants. 

Seating, picking your seat is very nice because you for have to show up to the theater an hour early for a decent seat. The premium seats are the way to go because you get the wait service with them. I would have loved a refill but we were in the regular seats because all the premium were taken. 

I would go again preferably with a premium seat and dinner in a restaurant. Not something I would do each time I want to see a movie but defiantly again."}
{"text":"I got a $50 iPic gift card from a client 2 years ago and my wife and I just decided to use it yesterday. The drive is a long one for us coming from South Chandler and that's the only drawback for us...the 30+ minute drive. Other than that, everything was excellent. I was a little nervous after reading some of the negative reviews on Yelp and we lowered our expectations. We splurged on the luxury reclining seats and so glad we did. Complimentary valet service meant we could drive right up to the curb. The inside was gorgeous and everyone was very friendly and helpful. This is like no other theater I've ever been to. I like the reclining seats at AMC Centerpoint, but this was 10 steps beyond that. Everything from start to finish was amazing. We got 2 reclining seats toward the front of the back section and loved the pillows and blankets...super posh. Our server came right up and told us what to expect and took our appetizer order, very nice guy - smiling, helpful and quick. At that moment I realized the bad reviews on Yelp had been way off and I relaxed. We kind of went all-out and ordered a full meal from appetizer to dessert and we're glad we did. What an experience. Our server really was incredible. Brought out our drinks right away and during the previews we each got a bag of popcorn. Before the previews were over he brought us our appetizers - pretzel bites with dipping sauce. My wife chose and I was doubtful, but wow, they were amazing. 6 pretzel bites (more like big sticks than bites) so 3 for each of us and a bacon/cheese sauce my wife loved and an apple mustard sauce that was incredible. Yelp reviews complained about the tilting tables and the uncomfortable seats...not so. Tables were perfect and seats were ultra comfortable. We are both tall and all we had to do was tuck our feet under the bar when reclining...no problem. The food all came out in perfect intervals, we didn't feel rushed. It seemed like our server knew exactly when we were done and removed the plates, all in the dark. Our meals were amazing. My wife got the margherita pizza and loved it. I got the mahi mahi fish tacos which I thought were amazing. They were wrapped up so there was no spillage. The way the food was presented and served was perfect for reclining back eating. We got an order of sweet potato fries to share and I'm not kidding when I say they were the best I've ever had. They stayed crunchy all the way through and had a side of BBQ dipping sauce. Never would have thought of that, I prefer ranch, but I was pleasantly surprised. We were so full but about 3/4 of the way through the movie, he brought us our dessert - a red velvet pudding to share - with 2 spoons. Seriously, that was huge, some restaurants give you a hard time if you want to share and you have to ask for 2 spoons. This dessert was freeking huge. No way one of us could have eaten it alone. And holy moly it was tasty. Again, my wife picked it and I had my doubts. Again, I was proven wrong. It was warm and delicious. We ate the whole thing. I didn't drink all of my Coke but my wife drank all of her Diet Coke and our server refilled it quickly. Not that it really matters, but we saw Tomorowland and thought it was a great movie. My wife cuddled with the blanket and pillow and we held hand anytime we weren't eating. We left a generous tip and didn't mind that the total bill was over $100 just for the 2 of us. Of course we won't be doing this every month but I think we just found an annual tradition. If there was one thing that was not perfect, it was where my wife was sitting, when reclined, the railing (she had the aisle seat) was in the corner of her eyeline so it blocked the corner of the movie screen. Not a huge deal and not worth taking off a star. But next time I will order earlier and get 2 seats in the middle. TIPS: Buy tickets online and buy early to get a better seat choice. Splurge for luxury recliner seats. Sign up for iPic's free loyalty program and get $2 off seats. Get there a half hour early to have time to look at menu and order while it's light. Order an entire meal for the full experience. It's costly, but it's worth it. Thanks iPic!"}
{"text":"Such an awesome place to just sit back on a recliner and free small popcorn on the premium plus seats when you get your ticket got a little dessert and very delicious."}
{"text":"This place exceeded my expectations. I went here with some friends to celebrate my birthday last weekend and we all had a fabulous time. It was by far the best movie watching experience I have ever had 

I think a lot of a the reviewers have already explained the concept and what to expect adequately. So, instead of a traditional review I am going to respond so some of the criticisms and so hopefully justify my 5 stars. 

It is true that most of the servers in the theater and the staff at the ticket machines and concession stands were all kids. However, I think that is same as any other movie theater; most of the time it is high school or college students working as a part time or summer job. Yes, this means that you can not ask them for their favorite on the list of specialty cocktails or expect them to come up with an educated food/wine pairing for you. However, I think this is offset by the wine dispensing machine in the lobby. You can sample small pours out front to try some of the selections on the wine list before you make you selection for dinner. Another common criticism is that the service was poor and extremely slow. It sounds like maybe they spent the first few months working out the kinks in the system because when we went our server (Elise, I think?) was totally on top of everything. She asked us to order apps, entree, and dessert all at once as well as multiple drinks if we were going to want more than one and said she would bring them out in appropriate sequence and spacing. This allowed the servers to already know what we wanted before the lights went out and so they could silently swoop in and place/remove plates of food and drinks during the movie. There were definitely points at which my drink was empty which would have bothered me if we were in a traditional restaurant. However, since it is a movie theater and I know we will all be sitting there for 2 plus hours no matter what, does it matter if I get my second drink immediately after my first? Or if my sister got her entree after I got mine. No, obviously not. Other reviewers also criticized the quality of the food. Again, I think this is a question of perspective. I loved my bbq flatbread pizza but some of my friends' food was decidedly average. So, if I evaluate this place solely as a restaurant, clearly it is not five-star worthy. But it is not a restaurant, it is a movie theater. So, when I compare it to other movie theater meals I have had in the past (greasy pizza, old hot dogs and soggy nachos) then this place is head and shoulders above the rest. And the prices were not that bad. I spent $60 on the whole night including tickets, food, drinks, tax and tip. Which is about what I would have spent on a regular dinner out. But in addition to dinner we got a really memorable experience. Over two hours of feeling pampered and having a great time with my friends.

I think this place is a must-try for movie lovers.  And it is great idea for something different to do on a special occassion with a group of friends or a date."}
{"text":"I seldom go to north Scottsdale and have gotten addicted to AMC's Dine-in Theater. But I decided to try out iPic again after a couple of year's absence. My review is mixed. On the positive side--the staff is very nice and friendly. The food and drinks are tasty. The premium reclining seats are wonderful. Finally, the theater made amends for one of the problems I had.

On the other side, though, it took over an hour to get my food (the problem I had--there does not seem to be a way of getting the wait staff's attention and I did not want to miss part of the movie to look for someone); and the women's bathroom was in need of maintenance (seat covers, toilet paper, a non-working stall, etc.). It is also expensive compared to AMC. I was disappointed."}
{"text":"If you don't pay for the upgraded premium seats, it really is not worth the visit. Paid $32 for 2 tickets to a recent movie and quickly found out we were paying for the grand entrance and not much else.

For the price you do get a leather chair that does not recline in any fashion and a wooden tray that is sticky, gross and can not be hidden. 

The actual experience of the movie was on par.. Sound, picture, lighting etc but after 2 tickets and 2 drinks from the bar that you have to get yourself, one is left to wonder why you just paid $60 for a $20 experience. 

In my opinion, either spend the extra money and go for the upgraded seats or don't waste your time at this theater."}
{"text":"I LOVED this place! Showtimes are way less frequent that normal theaters, but totally worth going. The food and drinks were both top notch. You can lay almost completely flat like a bed. They bring you popcorn at the beginning of the movie. It is on the pricier side for a movie, but worth the splurge."}
{"text":"I am so spoiled now, I honestly cannot see a movie any other way. Love it, love the service and atmosphere. My only suggestion would be to add and change up the menu items. Getting bored with them!"}
{"text":"I'm really dissapointed by this place. I came here with a date and paid an exorbitant amount of money for these movie tickets to see Skyfall. 

I imagine one of the reasons people come here with dates is to impress. The ambiance is really lovely, the seats are comfortable and for the most part its the most luxory you can find in a movie theater. 

Sadly the staff was extremely inattentive, rude and even considerably offensive. When selling luxory and glamour customer service has to be a priority."}
{"text":"We were really excited by the idea of going to iPic but disappointed with the experience overall.  While the theater was clean it didn't have the 'luxury' experience that is suggested.  The poor signage in the lobby made it confusing for a first time attendee.  Even after we told the usher checking tickets that it was our first time, she was more interested in reading her book than helping us out.  The concession stand wasn't able to serve wine (one of the machines was broken and the other only had half the selection) so told us just to go to the bar.  At the bar, we waited quite some time for a bartender and received poor service when we were served.  Service was simply OK and the expectation for a 'better experience' was simply not met.

The seats were comfortable, the theater was clean, and the sound and projection were great.  

Ultimately, the movie part was great but the experience was below standard.

UPDATE - iPic publicly posted that they were interested in following up on these concerns but have not taken any action since I shared my contact details with them."}
{"text":"Thank you for ruining our last night and very rare date night that my husband and I get to have here in AZ. Moving out of state and on our visit here we ordered food during our moving. They never put our order in and the only thing that they offered was free tickets to use again here. Well that's not going work seeing that the state we are moving to doesn't have this chain.  I once highly recommended this place but your compensation for fixing this for someone that can no longer use the tickets is worthless."}
{"text":"We've been going to iPic now for a couple of years.  I should have written this review a while ago and if I had it would have been 5 stars instead of 3.  My big complaint is the menu change, specifically the beer selection.  They used to have really cool and unique beers.  They had most of the usual suspects and it never changed but at least you had something unique.  Now, the beer selection looks more like Studio Movie Grill or TGI Fridays.  
Too bad as it is such a cool theatre, but let's face it, it is the ability to eat and drink that separates this theatre from others.  And, if all you have is a very bland selection, then it takes away from the experience and lumps it in with everyone else.  
We have taken the kids here (11 &17) and have always had a good experience with them.  They really like it but, as another reviewer mentioned, they won't want to go anywhere else.  Blankets and popcorn for premium plus is the only way to go.
Standard seating really makes no sense, as you have to get up during the movie to get food and drinks.  Better to pony up the extra cash to sit in the big seats and not miss any of the movie.
As far as the food goes, it is hit or miss, with most being hits.  However, the salad rolls from the other night were rubbery with a really odd mouth feel.  Some things just weren't made to be eaten in the dark.
Waiters and waitresses are always pleasant and helpful.
Please please please consider revising your beer selection so it doesn't look like Bennigan's.  I realize you may not be selling a ton of those obscure selections, but they are a big reason we go here."}
{"text":"This is a true first class experience (that being said, you are paying for first class!).  The entrance looks like an upscale bar, the bathrooms are gorgeous, the theaters offer plush, reclining chairs (complete with a pillow & throw blanket for each guest)...you might have to pick between watching the film and taking a nap.
The food & drinks are pretty good, not outstanding.  Popcorn is included in the ticket price.
All in all, if there's a film that you're really excited to see and you want to splurge on an upscale night out, iPic definitely delivers!"}
{"text":"Overall great experience.

Online ordering was easy.

Seats were comfortable - far and away the most comfortable movie theatre seats I've ever sat in.  It was like sitting on a Create and Barrel couch in my own living room.  Each seat even included a clean blanket.

The image / sound quality was great.

The food was excellent - delivered from the restaurant next door.

The price (approx $20 for regular seats and $28 for premium) seems reasonable to me -- especially considering how rarely I make it to a movie.

It's hard for me to imagine going to see a movie anywhere else in the Phoenix area, unless iPic didn't have the movie I wanted to see."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went on Friday night to watch the Revenant. It was suppose to start at 10:15 we arrived a little early to crab some drinks. At 10:10 we decided to head to our movie guessing it  be ready, well it wasn't. We waited for another 10 minutes for the room theater to be clean from the previous movie. I think for the amount of money they charge they should have a better schedule on when to clean the theater rooms. I don't even think they change the blankets nor the pillows on the seats. The only good thing about this place is the recliner seats."}
{"text":"Nice concept of wanting to be upscale and it would be a hit if the seats were comfortable. The idea of blankets is a nice touch for the cold and free popcorn is an added bonus. 

For 50.00 for two seats I would think I would be sitting on a pillow heaven recliner. Instead I felt my back resting on a metal bar going across the back rest. If the seats were awesome I would go every weekend. I wish I could take the iPic food and combine it with the Esplanade."}
{"text":"Where to start....First time experiencing iPic and wow.  Talk about the ultimate movie experience.  We had the premium seats( Leather chairs that recline with blanket and pillow ).  Plus wait service.  If you want to have a unique date night than the usual trip to the movies. This is the one and only way to do it.  
It is a little pricey, but so worth it for that one movie you have to see in theaters. I will definitely be going back along with signing up for the free membership for extra perks and updates.   

P.S. It's so comfortable and uh-mazing that don't be surprised if you get the urge to sleep.  I can see how people get lost in the comfort."}
{"text":"In general my wife and I don't like the restaurant in the movie concept. Ordering and paying in the dark while trying to pay attention to the screen is ridiculous. But everyone should try it at least once. Ipic does it well and deserves 4 stars for their upscale approach and ease of picking seats online. It's funny though, that something has gone haywire both times we've been to ipic. Almost like it was not meant to be. First time our daughter was in a cast and we bought seats she could not get to so at least ipic refunded our tickets. We skipped it and went home. 
Second time we just happened to pick the one Sunday evening the kitchen was closed for remodeling. At least they gave us 3 complimentary tickets for our next visit. That was nice. So we tried the premium seats and ordered soda. Popcorn was free. There's a blanket and nice big comfy lounge chairs. Although if I want to hold my wife's hand I'll need to sit somewhere else. Liked being able to put my feet up....but my long legs are too close to the people in front of me so I was kind enough not to kick them and just lowered my recliner a little. I'm six feet, not 6 ft 5. So this seems like a design flaw. 
Wish I could review the food but I can't. We'll be back again since we have complimentary tickets! Third time will be a charm and I hope to try the food and add a 5th star."}
{"text":"Over Priced and they didn't show that u have to upgrade for double price just to sit in recliner seats.  So I'm watching a movie for $17 in a stiff uncomfortable seat just because I didn't upgrade. Stick to Harkens everyone"}
{"text":"Clean, employees were friendly, food was great, highly recommend to try it out for a nice night out.  Definitely worth upgrading your seats to get the full experience."}
{"text":"Wowza!!! I feel like a queen when I come here. The pillow, blanket and comfy reclining chairs made this the most pleasant movie-going experience I have ever had. The menu looked delicious, although the only thing I got was a Diet Coke and my hubby got a beer. The Diet Coke was movie theater priced, which was a little disappointing. Overall this is not a cheap place to go to, and I will not be utilizing this as my most frequented movie theatre, but will definitely come back on special occasions!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Assigned seats, reclining chairs, and great service. It is a little pricey, but it's worth paying for. Best way to relax and enjoy a movie!"}
{"text":"Such a fun experience! Have been a few times - drive from Tucson because its so worth it. Girls night, Date night, etc all are a fun fit! The seats are super comfy and I am always cold so love the blanket. The food and drinks are very good.

Of course it's expensive...but worth it every once in a while!"}
{"text":"I moved from Ohio not long ago and from recommendations of co workers was told this was a great place for a movie.  Well let me tell you about my experience.  I got my ticket, of which they talked me into the upgrade ($25), and went to find my seat.  The ticket host explained which theater I was in and my server would meet me at my seat.  The previews had started so it was dark and it was very hard to see the row or the numbers.  I find my seat and I have to say the reclining chair was very nice and there was a blanket and a pillow.  Good idea, people tend to get cold in theaters.  So the movie starts, I am patiently waiting for the server.  I was told I could order a nice gourmet meal or appetizer, possible a drink and my upgraded seat came with complimentary popcorn.  An hour into the movie someone finally shows up.  Now while I was waiting I looked for a button to push for service, a small light, anything I could do to get a server to see me.  There was nothing like that available and I did not want to get up and miss some of the $25 movie I paid for to track someone down.  So by now and hour into the movie the waiter comes up and asks if I would like to order something, explains these nice appetizers, meals, etc.  Is there a menu? Would I even be able to see it?  So I just ask for a diet pepsi and the complimentary popcorn.  I was concerned if I ordered something it would be arriving as the movie is ending and I have to either get it to go or sit in an empty theater to eat.  By now the server knows I was a bit displeased with the delay and that there was no menu I could look at.  So for the remaining 45 minutes of the movie he kept coming over, would I like a refill? Am I sure I don't want to order something?  And then with about 10 minutes left he asks if I still want a refill and maybe am appetizing dessert on the house?  Really?  I came to get a meal and I did not plan on just having dessert.  I passed on the dessert and decided I would get a bite to eat at one of the restaurants outside of the theater.

Suggestion:  In Ohio AMC has the right idea, they have the same seats you do, what they have that is better is there is a menu at every table, a call button so you can get your wait staff, and small lights between each seat that can be turned down, this way you can see the menu and find your seat number.

The theater was nice and clean, however I don't feel the experience was worth the $25 for the movie ticket"}
{"text":"Went (finally) here last weekend. It is not cheap. Did spring for premium seats. Go early for less expensive ticket pricing. Would love to see breakfast/brunch on the menu. Then I would have ordered food. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"iPic gets 4 stars and here's why.

Reason 1: I love the concept they have.  Luxury movie watching at it's finest.  It's a great theater with great seating.  Especially if you pre-order tickets for big showings you don't have to wait in a line to get a good seat because your seat is already assigned.  I love that.

Reason 2: If you splurge on premium plus you get personal waiting service for food and alcohol.  Not too shabby.

Reason 3: The restrooms are on point.  Clean and nicely designed.

Reason 4: Free popcorn for premium plus seating and valet validation with your ticket! 

Reason 5: This is the reason for the missing fifth star.  The premium plus reclining seats are not as comfortable as they may seem.  After many people reclining and laying down on these things the cushioning has worn out and I can always feel the mechanics of the chair on my butt or back.  I'm always shifting my weight around because I'm so uncomfortable.  Some of the trays are bent downward so they're not fully level.  It's probably from people using them to get up from the chair.  My drinks kept sliding down to one side so I had to keep an eye on it to make sure it didn't spill on me.

Those are my reasons and I'm sticking to them.  This place is great and the location is great.  It's a great date night kind of place."}
{"text":"When in Phoenix you must go to this theatre! Located in the Scottsdale quarter, it's the perfect location for a theatre of this kind. You can purchase your tickets before hand or there and though it's a little more expensive, the experience is worth the extra couple of dollars! There is a full bar inside along with food - I'm talking about real food not just your typical nachos and hot dogs that are available at theaters. 
The Seats in this theatre are amazing! You can pay a little extra and sit in the upper portion of the theatre in the cute orange seats that are so relaxing. In these seats you get your own server who comes and asks if you need any more drinks or food- great service! Btw the sweet potato fries are the best I've ever had, who would have ever known! After relaxing in the theatre( feels like you're at home in your own private theatre) you can walk around and enjoy the tons of cute shops and of course great restaurants that surround the theatre!"}
{"text":"Our favorite theater! Always go for the premium seats. So comfy, with a blanket and pillow. Free popcorn and waiter service. Love it!"}
{"text":"The environment is terrific with the luxury seating and spacious setting. Love this part.  However, it's been tough getting my husband to go as he hates the popcorn - a big part of his movie-going  experience is having good popcorn!  The people working there are always helpful and friendly,"}
{"text":"Came here during a recent theater rent-out by my employer who booked the place to go over company slides and watch a private movie screening, so I didn't actually pay anything, my employer did, but I've heard about iPic's normal prices. 

The photos are legit. This place looks like a moderately mid-upscale bar with theaters. It's the proper place for a dress-casual attire movie going, not for flip flops but not for tuxedos either. The place is nicely decorated in the \"traditional/typical modern Scottsdalian\" style. The restrooms are such that the sinks are trays. You know, \"upscaley\". (Because we want to see that the last guy indeed did not have grime.) You step into the theater and, yes indeed, the seats are big lounge chairs. The nicer seats toward the back are orange-colored orangey orange (kind of like the three stars I'm posting this with).

You sit down and, where at SMG you would see the call button, here you see buttons that make the chair go back and prop your feet up. Real recliners! Sadly, I believe that for those who have to pay tickets for such seats end up paying, .. well, you know, .. Scottsdalian numbers. The seat was furnished with a cloth handkerchief, a blanket, and a pillow. A tiny little table was attached to the chair that you could swivel out in front of you; when I ate, however, the table was quite high and awkward. I looked around and saw only one beverage holder between myself and the seat next to me (my seat and the other seat were a single group), and it was between the seats, so I figured they expected people to put drinks on the floor or something... except, no, the Scottsdalians would be drinking *drinks* (alcohol), so perhaps indeed that's what the table is really for. 

I was annoyed to find that I was actually surprisingly uncomfortable in my recliner. It seemed that there wasn't much cushion below me. I'm a big guy; I'd take a non-reclining chair with more padding than a recliner with poor padding. I considered moving to the front but didn't want to be in the front of the theater and had already made myself otherwise \"comfortable\" where I was.

The walls of the theater are blanketed with carpet like any other theater (for soundproofing) and then overlaid with some very old fashioned drapes. The sound system isn't bad at all, but then I wasn't watching a sci-fi nor action movie.

So it's certainly a fine experience. However, they do have competition: Studio Movie Grill and one of the local AMCs. I haven't been to AMC but I am a regular visitor to Studio Movie Grill, so here's my thought on this: Studio Movie Grill has very nice seating and dinner menus--not as nice seating as iPic, just somewhere in the middle between iPic and an old fashioned plain theater seat. SMG gives you WAAAAY more for the dollar including the experience. In fact, SMG is pretty close to a \"normal movie ticket\" price, yet they, too, have a bar and a way more convenient dining experience (call button on the seats, waiters throughout the whole movie), and the dinner menu is about the same as any restaurant. iPic, while a step up in the environment, is as far as I know quite excessive in the cost of the experience. I'll give it to iPic's businessmen, if they can manage to get people to come, what a great way to make money, because all that money spent on an experience that cost iPic trivial dollars to decorate one time (plus the simple costs to maintain) is really smart ROI for them. For the corporate theater rent-out, as someone who paid nothing I would say I LOVED the whole experience, I just wouldn't pay what I've heard some people have paid. So, for the individual buyer, unless you have a lot of money to toss around, I would recommend AMC or SMG instead. (By the way, SMG frequently has $5 Groupon deals for a movie seat plus a soda. Can't beat that!)"}
{"text":"I have been to ipic several times and frankly will say that I will not watch a movie anywhere else!   I am a member so that reduces the cost considerably (membership is free).  I know bring any of my friends from out of town to this theater to either watch movies or just hang out at salt.  My most recent experience was probably the worse out of the bunch, just to say that they were understaffed at salt, and especially after a movie just starts where the bartenders are feverishly preparing drinks for those watchin movies and ignore anyone at the bar.   But other than that, the place rocks!  Once you watch a movie here, you'll never want to watch it anywhere else!"}
{"text":"This place is very impressive. High class, trendy, and really comfortable. It is double the price as regular theatres...but those are regular theatres. 
If you want, you can partake in additional services like ordering food or drinks while watching your movie or you can simply just go to enjoy the movie. 
I dont think all movies deserve the level of attention and class that is offered at this theatre but on special occassions or for special movies, definitely go. 
If you reserve online and become a memeber you get free benefits too. do it!"}
{"text":"The thought of ever sitting in a sticky, stinky, over filled Harkins again makes me want to cry.  iPic has ruined all other theaters for me. 
First off, these seats are huge.  Sorry fly boys, that yawn move isn't going to work here. Copping a feel would be serious work.  And to the 10 year old in every R rated movie I go to way past their bed times, your parent's poor decisions wont effect me tonight.  Unless your wearing stilts no way are you kicking the back of my seat.
Over priced soda.  No thanks, I'll take a glass of wine, or the complimentary sodas they offer.  Stale popcorn, uh none for me thanks, fresh popped and free!  But save room for the extensive menu they offer.  
Was it pricey? Yes.
Is it worth it? Absolutely.

Oh, and there's a soft fluffly blanket sitting on the seat for each guest.  Nice touch, ipic, very nice touch."}
{"text":"I can't give a five star review because I got the seats that were in front (premium only).. and I got motion sickness. We also got the 3D showing they offered the kind of glasses that cover your eyes and are heavy.. probably added more to my motion sickness.  The tickets up front are just not worth it even though its cheaper. You can't order food at your seat(which is the whole reason why we came to the \"dine in\" theater) and you are looking up close for a good 2 hours (average movie time).  I had to miss a good amount of the movie because I just had to step outside....  I want to come back a 2nd time for the premium plus seats though the price seems steep. The problem is the website... it really doesn't tell you that you cant order food at premium only.. it was not until I got to the theater that I found out.. and we were hurrying to order our food.  

The food was really yummy, we ordered at the bar and the waiter was nice enough to walk with us to our seats so we're not awkwardly holding 3 plates and 2 drinks ourselves.  Our food:

Lobster roll-  The flavors will blow your mind.. but so will the shock of the small portion

Sliders- This was the recommendation by all my coworkers that have previously been to the theater.  They were yummy but a little bit on the cold side, it would have been nice to come with a small portion of fries.  But I did see that everything seems to come in a la carte

Truffle fries- So much truffle oil taste, yum yum! A great item for sharing purposes


Pro tips: GET PREMIUM PLUS SEATS, come a little early to order food."}
{"text":"Certainly an interesting experience. I was sad that they didn't have the yelp promotional check-in gift.

The chairs? AMAZING. You get a blanket and a pillow. If it isn't a good movie you will have a stellar nap.

The food was great too, the Brownie/Ice Cream sandwich is soooo good but its huge. Split it with 2 people. The house made chips were delicious, I know to order a side of ranch with them next time to make them better.

The one thing I wish they did have that the AMC Esplanade has is push buttons to call your wait staff. Besides that it was a very neat experience. Not for the faint of wallet though so keep that in mind it is expensive. 

Also note: We sat in the premium seating. From seeing both I wouldn't sit in the others now.

The Wine carousel was very very cool, I wish more places had them. Maybe I missed it but if not please update it with some Moscato!"}
{"text":"Just an Yelp business owners town hall here, and WOW!  

I am truly impressed, I've moved here about a month ago and come to Scottsdale Quarters pretty often, and have seen the iPic sign, but didn't realize that it was a theater with comfy seats, a table and cup holder to enjoy your food so that it is not on your lap.  This is probably the cleanest movie theater I've ever been in!  

I am totally coming back to enjoy a movie or two!"}
{"text":"A good experience, not a great one.  The seats in the movie theater are very close together, and when you turn your head and see someone else's shoe 6 inches from your face ... well, that is not good.  Service was fine, the food was fine, and it was an overall good night out with my man.  We are used to the IPIC in Pasadena, where you have a button on your table, and if you need your server, you buzz them ... not having that was a bit strange.  This theater is much bigger than the one in Pasadena, the bar is much larger, and the bathrooms are incredibly clean and spacious (that matters to some people quite a bit)."}
{"text":"To be completely honest, I knew there was a theater at Scottsdale Quarter but never thought about seeing a movie there. My son was going to see a movie there and invited us but we went online to reserve our tickets. 

I was expecting these general admission ticket almost like Southwest Airlines (first come first serve) but no. You reserve your seats and my son told me to get the Premium Plus tickets. Premium tickets are $17 and the Plus cost another $10 for one ticket. My goodness. 

Anyways, we walk in the door and it's like a check-in desk. Not your normal theater window with a little hole to talk through. We find our seats and there were 3 guys there to help us find out row and seats. 

Ok. Premium Plus is a lazy boy chair and you have a leg rest but can't lean back. Very plush chairs. Soft and comfortable. You also get a small pillow and blanket with a little table for food and a cloth napkin. Oh yea they have a full restaurant menu with drinks, appetizers, entrees and such. Sorry but I didn't order any food. They gave us a glass of water in a glass like at a restaurant and a bag of popcorn which is included in the price. One last thing. You get a personal server too. This is too much but now I know why it cost so much. 

Other people got drinks and food. My son got a pizza and my mom go sliders. They said the food was okay. Not great but what do you expect from a theater. Hahaha

So we saw Kidnap with Halle Berry. It was a very pampered experience at the movies. One thing I noticed is the Premium seats are normal theater seats which are close to the screen and all the premium Plus seats we taken. Very interesting. 

One last note. Went to the bathroom and oh my goodness. Bathroom is very fancy too. Almost like an upscale restaurant. Not theater experience here but pure and unadulterated luxury and pampering. 

The only bad thing is my son just mentioned that his seat was a little dirty but oh well. The real question is will I be back. Hahaha. Probably not. To be honest, I don't need that kind of pampering at the movies but if you want to impress someone then here's your chance. Enjoy"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to I Pic last night and purchased 2 premium seats where we could enjoy food service.  Our server took our order which was 2 orders of mini burgers, truffle fries, wine and an ice tea.  The ice tea came out first, then 1 set of burgers and fries came out, then the wine.  Why would the wine come after the food? The server misunderstood that we wanted two orders of burgers so I had to wait another 15 minutes for my burgers...in the mean time the fries were getting cold and the ice in my tea was melting.  Long story short we ended up being interrupted 6 times during the movie before we had our complete meal. We complained to the  manager.  While exiting the theater the manager was waiting for us, and told us he'd like to talk to us.  We felt like little kids going to the principal's office.  We stood in the lobby and explained the poor service again.  The manager, said the bar was probably slammed,  and haven't I ever gotten my food out of order at other restaurants? He even questioned me, if I ordered too late-I didn't.  Then he told me he looked us up to see how many times we've been there before (quite a bit).  After all this he had the audacity to ask for a tip for my server.  Our server lacked time management, but the managers total lack of experience showed and made this trip to the IPic unpleasant to say the least. He did comp our meal, but really just a sincere apology would have been better."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, beautiful theaters.. although their membership needs some additional perks, love every visit"}
{"text":"NOW THIS IS THE WAY TO WATCH A FILM! 

On a blisteringly hot day in Arizona buy a few tickets and spend the day inside. Heaven! Pure luxury. 

Food. Drink. And a big old soft comfy recliner.  

You never want it to end. Way cool. 

Ah, come-on, can't I spend the night in here watching movies? P.R.E.T.T.Y. P.L.E.A.S.S.S.E? With sugar on top??????"}
{"text":"iPic is ePIC!  iPic Theatres is above and beyond any kind of movie theater I have ever been to, and I have to been to the movies in foreign countries where they have couches and meals. 

If you are a movie nerd and want to actually get into the movie and not be distracted or even just hard of hearing, you should sit in the seats in the front.  If you want an even more incredible experience, upgrade your seat to the back few rows (where you will still be blasted by the high decibel sound system).  

Unless you are over six feet tall, your feet will reach the floor when you are seated, but you will still be low into your chair.  This provides you the ability to talk to other people and order food and not disturb other people.

The food is decent, but the drinks are awesome, including the non-alcoholic passion tea - get it!  Is this experience worth $25?  Yes, and I even drove from Tucson.  Is it worth $100 (food, drink, popcorn, dessert, upgraded seating?  Probably not.

The bathrooms are incredibly nice also.  The staff is friendly, accommodating, and even cute in a \"I'm passionate about my job, and I love this place too\" type of way.  Go check it out!  Watching movies here and trying to eat is sensory overload!"}
{"text":"I've been to iPic twice, and although it amazing, I can't justify the costs.

The first movie I saw here was The Lorax in 3-D (I swear I'm an adult). We got there pretty early, and started with a drink in the lounge. The lounge is swanky and the drinks were good. There is also a serve yourself wine station in the lobby of the theater, but it's kind of pricey.

Once it was time to head into the show, we settled into our \"Premium Plus Seating.\" The seats were awesome. They reclined and came with pillows, blankets and popcorn. But at $27 a seat, they weren't that awesome. My mom and I shared two entrees during the movie. One of them was just okay (in fact, I can't even remember the name), but the chicken strips might be the best I've ever had! Seriously. I would come back here just to eat that.

On my second visit, we didn't get there with too much time to spare, so we decided just to grab snacks at the concession stand. I was going to get wine from the self-serve dispenser, but the guy behind the counter informed me they have $20 bottles. It definitely wasn't as good as the wines in the dispenser, but for $20, it was a damn good deal.

This time, we sat in the regular seats. They are a little closer to the screen, but since we were just seeing \"This is 40\" it wasn't too bad. These seats don't recline or come with all the extras of the \"Premium Plus\" seating,( i.e. no blanket, pillow, popcorn, or waiter service). But at $16/seat, the price is a bit easier to swallow.

I really like iPic, but I think it's only worth a visit if you sit in the Premium Plus seats The regular seats are comparable to AMC Dine-in, but AMC is cheaper. I just can't justify spending $27 every time I want to go to the movies, hence the 4 stars.

P.S.-- Make sure you pay a trip to the bathroom because in the words of my 9-year old cousin \"These are the nicest bathrooms I've ever seen!\""}
{"text":"Front desk and seating was what earned the 2 stars. Unfortunately once seated our server was nonexistent. She said she would serve us for an hour and a half. We asked for a pitcher of beer she told us they only did glasses but they were only $2 each. Unfortunately she never came back. I finally for up missing the movie to ask another server in the hall for help. She finally came back over an hour into the movie. Just spent over $50 just to miss part of a movie and stress about flagging down a server. Ouch.  :("}
{"text":"Love the concept of a theater that makes you feel like you are at home in your favorite recliner. The Premium seats recline, provide a blanket and pillow and small bag of popcorn.  You have immediate attention from a server to bring you items from their expansive menu. 
Bad news is this isn't cheap.  The tickets for the premium seats are easily three times the price of a regular theater. With that said, it's worth the splurge some days. 
Also, the \"regular\" seats are still over priced and don't come with any of the above. In fact they are extremely uncomfortable. The position of the headrest pushes your head forward and the seats don't recline. I would avoid these if the premium are available.   Remember,  no blanket, no pillow, no service and pricey. You decide."}
{"text":"Four of us went to the iPic theater in the Scottsdale Quarter last Sunday and saw Jumangi at the 2:30 show. 
The entry and non theater areas are beautifully done and the space is very inviting. 
Everyone in our group had the same complaint. The non-recliner seating in the  theater is very uncomfortable. The seat backs are soft but the headrest are hard and unyielding. We all had neck pain from our heads being forced forward in an uncomfortable position. 
I was at this iPic theater when it first opened and once seated I remembered the same issue I felt that time. 
I've had much better seating at lower priced theaters and probably won't be going back to iPic anytime soon."}
{"text":"Heard only a little bit about this theater and thought I would check it out. The experience was awesome! Free valet, great atmosphere/decor and I love the fact you can bring drinks and order food from your chair. The seats are amazing...I'm 5'7\" and the seats fit me perfectly. 

I wasn't hungry (we had just come from dinner) or thirsty but they gave us free popcorn and so I ordered a drink...because I could! Next time I'll save room for dessert and have that while watching the movie. 

Great concept...I'll definitely be back. The ticket prices are a bit pricey as far as a movie experience goes (although worth it) so this won't replace Harkins for me. But it is fun to do for a special treat!"}
{"text":"Dinner and a movie. Very good food chairs were good theatre was clean staff was attentive. Overall great experience. One thing staff could have gotten the dishes faster. A little pricey but if you know going in the you will have a good time"}
{"text":"Pretty awesome! You get valet parking, popcorn and a great seat with pillow and blanket for about $20. Really good deal."}
{"text":"At first I didn't want to go here  because I thought the name was stupid. However, it's a pretty nice theater and after going here it's kind of hard to go back to a regular theater. There is decent  restaurant combined with the theater service, so this is convenient for me as a parent (babysitter per hour fees at home)."}
{"text":"Movie Nirvana

Wife took me to iPic for my birthday to take in a blockbuster. Whereas once I was lost, now I am found.  

Picture this: Lounger with perfect foam padding; electronic seat positioning; soft (clean smelling) blanket; comfy pillows; big arm pads; and a waiter tending your food and drink wants.  Heck with Heaven...

Video and sound are movie-quality.  Waiter was a pro and didn't pester as I enjoyed the movie with my nicely elevated feet supported at zero gravity.  Food was good, though not great.  

Bathroom is fancy enough that you doubt whether you should to tinkle.  

Worth every penny and a few extra."}
{"text":"Probably the best of the luxury theaters in the Valley.  Unlike the AMC Esplanade, which forces you to choose movie times based on the Fork and Screen or more plush (and more expensive) Cinema Suites experience, iPic offers both in the same theater.  You can opt for premium recliner seats that come with a blanket, pillow, and complimentary small popcorn, or the regular seating closer to the front, which is less plush and doesn't come with anything, including service.  Haven't tried the food here yet, but the drinks are good.  Service is decent, and what you'd expect for a bunch of servers who are plodding around in the dark trying to quietly distribute the correct orders to people they can barely see.  Expect to pay for your experience, but if you're looking for the best luxury theater experience, this is it."}
{"text":"THIS theatre was awful, no room for your legs to move if you have any kind of leg pain or disability, there is no room.  The arm rests are broken and gone, the arm rests have no place or cup holders for your beverages which are expensive and no refills, the lids on the beverages are big and causes your  beverages to leak everywhere.  The popcorn is not free it is $6.00 and no refills at all.  The food is $12.00 and up, and don't forget, A MUSHROOM BURGER IS NOT A BURGER, ACCORDING TO THE STAFF AND MANAGEMENT THERE.  EVERYTHING IS MISLEADING and the management makes you look like you are the crazy one.  When we received the mushroom burger with no burger they laughed at us. We said if it is a mushroom burger, then it is a burger with mushrooms.  According to them it is a mushroom only on a bun, NEVER HEARD OF ANYTHING LIKE THIS IN ALL MY LIFE.   OH AND THE BATHROOMS HAVE NO SEAT COVERS AT ALL. FOR $14.40 A MOVIE YOU GET NOTHING, DO NO WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY.  AMC IS BETTER ESPECIALLY IF YOUR A  MOVIE WATCHER, YOU GET FREE MOVIES,FREE POPCORN AND FREE DRINKS."}
{"text":"In the last year, my husband and I have discovered these new types of theaters that offer a luxury experience. We are regular patrons of the AMC Esplanade but wanted to try iPic for a date night. We loved it! 

I thought the premium seats were the most comfortable about of all the luxury theaters we have tried. I am never going to a regular theater again. Ever. You have a blanket and pillow waiting for you when you buy the premium seats. My only complaints are the hand railing blocked some of the screen, and the recliners were not made for tall people. My husband is 6'5 and could not recline the seat, have his legs out straight, and not kick the head of the person in front of him. Oh, and one more complaint, I thought the menu could be a little bigger and offer a little more variety. I just wasn't wowed by the choice, they seemed very comparable to other theaters. The truffle fries, were delicious! 

Our waiter got to us quickly and his service was excellent. 

The prices for the tickets were a little pricey ($54) but the food and drinks were $46 with tip. So we figured that would be close to the total of a dinner at an upscale restaurant. 

We got to iPic like 10 minutes before our movie started so we didn't have time to sit around and have some drinks before, but the bar next door looked pretty cool. I noticed the typical Scottsdale crowd, so IDK if I'd venture over there anyway. Maybe!

Overall, I enjoyed the experience and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Talk about \"doing it with style\"! iPic provides everything you could possibly need for a date night. 

Walking into the theatre and knowing where my seats are makes life much easier... No fighting off people and running up the steps to get the last 2 seats together. 

I'm pretty sure the chairs are more comfortable than my recliner at home; plus they come with your own pillow and neatly wrapped blanket to snuggle into.  The popcorn is served to you no questions asked and c'mon the drinks and food are divine! (Trust me - try the flatbread) I really love the fact that they incorporate local ingredients into their food as well. 

Bargain hunters pay attention! Becoming a member is definitely worth it... Tuesday's become discount night, and if you make it in for happy hour they have $2.00 beers and $5.00 wine! 

Don't feel like seeing a movie? Come in to watch football and the same happy hour applies with discounted wings!"}
{"text":"I would like to start off by saying that I previously really enjoyed my experiences here...until mother's day.  I spent $54 for 2 tickets to sit in the upgraded seats.  I was led to my seat by the staff and got comfy, ordered drinks etc.  I was then told by some crazy lady looking for an argument that I stole this older couples seats- because they thought I was in their assigned seats.  (I didn't steal the seats, nor was I in the wrong place) So a rather ridiculous argument ensued.  I asked the waiter if I was in the correct seats and was told yes.  For some reason, this woman kept pursuing the matter, I told her to shut up and leave me alone and she went to get the manager to have me \"kicked out\" of the theater.  So the manager came and asked to see my ticket, then said Yes I was in the right seats (again!).  Then he told me to \"Drop It\" and walked away after I explained what this woman was doing.  I thought that was handled quite poorly by the manager after being harassed by this woman.  It was totally embarassing and I was just trying to give my mom a nice day.  When I pay this much to see a movie, I don't ever want to hear \"drop it\" when I am displeased...especially after frequenting this place many times.  An \"I'm sorry\" would have been much nicer!!!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best movie theater I have ever been in. Why you may ask? 
1) reclining chairs 
2) soft blanket and pillow (I am usually cold in theaters so this was awesome) 
3) PLENTY of leg space 
4) it wasn't crowded as they don't even have many seats in the place 
5) complimentary huge bag of popcorn 
6) they come and take your order and bring it out to you 

The prices are a little high, but make sure to sign up for their free membership. This will save you some money ( I think $3) and give you a free movie ticket on your birthday. Coming here is def a treat. 

PS. there were no annoying loud making out teenagers in the place, which is def a perk from other movie theaters"}
{"text":"As you may have noticed, my poor review had them Privately message me for my contact information.  I provided it 3 days ago, and {still} no response.  

I always find it very interesting that businesses monitor their reviews, but usually take very little true {system} action.  In this case, their customer service folks seem to be enjoying the holidays and have literally, checked out."}
{"text":"Wow!  The new age!  The most comfortable movie experience I have ever had outside of a living room.  Basically the same comfort as a living room - oversized comfy lazy-boy-style chair, blankets, pillows... free water and popcorn (nice)... service to your seat by an attendant who tries very hard not to disturb anyone during the film... an okay drink and food list (much better than expected, but hey, it's still the movies...)  Great screen, audio, visual, sensory, overall time at the movies!"}
{"text":"Not really impressed and honestly don't see how this place earned so many good reviews. First, it was a little confusing finding the place. In fact my whole party had some trouble meeting up. Once we went to buy our tickets the young girl with dark hair had ZERO personality and didn't explain anything. Luckily, I had been to their competitor recently so I wasn't as confused as the rest of my party. The girl at the front just went straight to selling tickets with no explanation of what we were getting or which seats were more expensive. Once we grabbed our tickets we headed over to the Tanzy Express side to grab some quick food since we just wanted a snack. Once again my party was confused on the different restaurants and where the hell to get our food. Once we saw the wine in cases we were once again confused on how to get some. Do you think anybody offered to explain anything? Nope. At this point we skipped the wine and once we finally got our snacks we dashed off to the movie. The restrooms were clean and very nice. The theatre itself was very clean and nice. I guess the worst part was really just the service?? Hire some new people with personalities and educate them. Nobody seemed to know what was going on with this place. For the money, I don't think it was worth it. Would rather head over to AMC...."}
{"text":"This is a very wonderful theatre and an awesome experience. I love this place and it definately is worth the extra $$.  

I do really wish it was a tad less expensive.  And I wish they served more of the yummy popcorn! It's very good!  The facility is super nice, but someone said there aren't kids allowed and I saw a ton of kids coming out of an age appropriate movie with their parents. No complaints, with the appropriate supervision I actually enjoy kids!

There are some mixed reviews here, and I have my own...but the overall experience has been 5 star worth.  It's probably really a 4, but it seems like the folks who own these theatres are really working hard for their clients and want this to be a great experience.  

Some things still need to be worked out:

--The bar is silly, but very gorgeous and comfortable.  We just had horrible service, for no reason - we were 2 of 4 folks at the bar!  One bartender was wonderful, but he just disappeared and never said good-bye. The new bartender never asked us for a refill (their loss) but then the waitress from the theatre came and sat with us and she was so helpful and got our glasses refilled - so we tipped her later, not the  barkeeper!

--The birthday policy is odd. It is written down as the week of your birthdya, but actually the free tickets are only AFTER the birthday, not before it?  Not even one night before the birthday. So I am a single mom, married to a professional musician and well...Tuesday is the ONLY day we both have our evenings free this week for our romantic birthday celebration!  So, I begged this awesomely nice person in customer service (Frank Donnelly) and get them to approve free tickets. The managers, Phil Miglino & Valerie Irizarry are on board and giving me a free ticket, so we are going again tonight.  Thanks Phil and Val! :-)

-- The chairs are entirely tooo comfortable and we might fall asleep.  It's better than being at home!

The best things are:
---The chairs - go for it and get the reclining ones if you are going!
---The FRESH popcorn (who said it wasn't fresh, total liars...ours was awesome!)
---The servers who care! They are so awesome!!!!  I think our server's name was Candace and she was AMAZING. 
---The bathrooms are luxurious 
---The food is decent and the Tuesday pricing is reasonable for food as well as GREAT for beer and wine!"}
{"text":"This place is SO FUN! I took my fiance there for his birthday. We got the upgraded seats which were so worth it. We both had such a good time! The food was great and everything was so reasonably priced. We spent less on food and drinks than we would have if we had gone out to eat before the show."}
{"text":"Great setting, seating and atmosphere.  Yes it's great to have a glass of beer, wine etc. and some nice touches like popcorn etc. 

BUT it is NOT a restaurant and yes, the food is mediocre at best and let's all agree, it is next to impossible to eat, let alone serve in the dark.

Most times you go to a show and a movie so I suggest breaking it up and choosing one of the many great restaurants at the Quarter and enjoy the show with a beverage, great seats and have the best of all worlds!"}
{"text":"This is Scottsdale at it's best or should I say worst. iPic has lots of cool features, but in they really don't work.

Our friends suggested a movie and the Gold-class seating. Neat idea and while the seats were really comfy I'm tall and couldn't recline my seat back without the fear of kicking the person in front of me in the head. Who really wants my dirty shoes caressing their hair? I know I wouldn't like it.

As others have stated the service is pathetically S-L-O-W! They have notices everywhere that the service only lasts 20 minutes into the show, but it took 35 minutes for a Flatbread, Caesar Salad and two Diet Cokes.  The popcorn that's included with the Gold-Class seats took just as long. So, for almost $40, including tip, we received slow service, small portions and no refills on the drinks. Grand total almost $75 for an afternoon at the movies. IMHO, it's not really worth it, maybe for a special occasion, but not on a regular basis.

Two of us can go to the local Cineplex for $19 (even less during off-peak hours) get popcorn and a drink for around $12 and keep over $40 in my pocket.

For the sake of the people that work there, I really hope it works out. From now on I'm spending my money at Harkins!"}
{"text":"This is our second time going to ipic. First time we didn't really prepare - we got the last seats, on the day we were going, to see The Fighter. We didn't realize that you have to book in advance to get the good seats. We sat at the front with in the gold seats. Nothing special they are just comfy. We had 2 drinks at Salt which were good, very pretty looking! The movie was good, we got to take in the wine we bought from the wine dispensing machines! So cool! You buy a credit-like card and pop it in and select how many ounces you want and type of wine you want. They have 2 machines - the prices are high but it is a cute idea and great for dates. The only down side is that it pours the exact ounce you order - rather than ordering from a bartender who will usually over-pour. We went to the restaurant attached to the theatre, Tanzy, after the movie, it was ok - nothing special. 

The second time we went to iPic was this past Friday. We went to Narcisse first for some champagne before the movie and we really liked that. Narcisse is also at the top of the escalator at the end of where Salt Lounge is located. We ordered our tickets on Wednesday (2 days prior) and got great platinum seats. They reclined, we got valet parking (they validate it when you pick up your tickets), unlimited popcorn - we got tons! [The valet parking is worth it since last time we went it took us a while to drive all the way to the bottom to find a parking spot] You also get blankets and pillows which were clean (I was a little skeptical about this feature at first). The movie wasn't good (No Strings Attached) but the seats were great!  Oh yes we were starving when we got out and nothing was open so we ordered \"Gold Class Nachos\" from Salt Lounge which were $10 and some flatbread that I can't find on the menu now at Salt after. Okay so the waitresses at Salt Lounge are interesting. We see one of them serve the ladies at the couches beside us our nachos and we watch as the girls start eating them knowing they weren't there's. The waitress comes back and notices her mistake, picks up the nachos and hands them to us! I was disgusted! I was like ummm those ladies touched and ate half of these! So she went back and (hopefully) brought us a new plate. I won't go back to eat there again but they serve Fresca as a mixer so I would just go for drinks.

Overall it is a great movie experience - tons of drinks, food, and they treat you very well. Just a little on the expensive side for a weekly movie."}
{"text":"This place is beautiful, probably the most beautifully decorated theater I have ever attended.  So why the two stars?  It is grossly overpriced for what it is.  The wife and I came to Scottsdale for her birthday and decided to give this place a go.  When I saw the price, which was 48$ for two people, I was dumbfounded.  Then to make things worse, if you get their \"cheap\" version you have to get your own food.  That's lame, seriously lame.  So we ordered our food, and while it was good we paid nearly 40$ for a pizza that was more like an appetizer than an entree.  Then, as others have stated, the seats are not that comfortable.  Not the worst, but with the money you're shelling out, it better be fantastic.  Overall, it's nice place to watch a movie, but it's definitely not worth the price.  I'd rather eat at a nicer, cheaper restaurant and see a movie at Harkins."}
{"text":"My wife and I wanted to see a movie the other day. I'd been wanting to go here for quite some time to check it out since I'd heard so many good things.

We opted for the premier seats in the back that recline. They were so comfortable that if the movie hadn't been interesting, I certainly would have passed out.

The popcorn was really delicious too. Probably the best I've had at a theater.

The menu pricing for drinks is a bit mixed - I can understand $5 for a beer, but not for a non-alcoholic iced tea. I will say that the draft beer I had seemed a bit stronger than I expected, not sure how. Not a complaint, just an observation.

The entire place feels really upscale.

We plan to come back at some point."}
{"text":"After their comment on the review about taking reviews seriously, I sent them a message about the theater, movie and my email address.  No response from them."}
{"text":"Prepare to spend money, but you get what you pay for.

Showtimes are limited, not as frequent as other theatres, so plan ahead cause its usually pretty full in there. The other reason I give 4 stars is because unless you pay $24/seat, you have to get your own order & take it to your seat.

However-- the food served here was great!! Pricey (I spent $55 on 2 entrees & an app) but definitely delicious. I got the chicken satay with asparagus & lemon sauce & the hubs got the tenderloin sliders, we got truffle fries to share.

Seats are extra comfortable, thats no doubt.

This place is great for a once in a while date, but not every week moviegoers like ourselves.

Oh, parking is also a pain, but there is a parking garage nearby thats free."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE ipic theaters! I go every or every other tuesday to see a new movie and its my favorite place to see a movie and have a mellow night. the service is always amazing too!"}
{"text":"iPic Theaters was a great experience. I thoroughly enjoyed going there to watch a movie. The only downfall is that it is a little bit expensive, but its a real treat! I'd say go big or go home and get the big lazy boy couches and the food and drinks. It's a great place for date night. The couches are comfortable, they give you pillows and blankets although I'm not sure how clean they are. I saw a white stain on my blanket and threw it down on the ground immediately (ew). The movies are always great. Try and buy tickets online ahead of time, otherwise you may be seated separately as you can choose where you'd like to sit and who you'd like to sit next to online."}
{"text":"I'm feeling the vibe of Vegas-style clubs transformed into a movie theater.  A full bar inside complete with stylish chic furniture all around, online movie booking with e-ticket pick up, reclining seat and a table for your drink/food, menu order option, or pick up dinner to take inside. All that for the cost of $25.00 a ticket!  The $25 also includes blanket and pillow.  You can sign up become a member for special offers and discounts.  A cool movie experience for a first date, celebrate birthday, or anniversary."}
{"text":"I've been to AMC, and I've been to Harkins. I like different aspects of both. However, this theater was so luxurious that I felt incredibly spoiled. A cousin and I went to see the latest and last Harry Potter here for midnight, and we loved it. We arrived about an hour and a half early, so we waited in their cocktail lounge. It was like being in a small club, just not as loud and obnoxious. On the other side of the lobby is a small restaurant with \"chef inspired cuisine\". We didn't go into that part. We did, however, order food from there while we were in our seats in the theater. Yes, we ordered ale battered chicken strips and truffle fries while we were sitting in our seats for the movie. The tickets we bought were the premium plus. The price is 17.50 (there is also the 14.00 ticket which get you a comfy leather chair) which is 10 more than I'm used to spending, but it includes reserved seating, a lazy boy like chair, free popcorn and drink, a blanket, a pillow, and comfort beyond any theater I have been too. The food wasn't amazing, especially for the price, but it was decent and worth the convenience. Down sides? When we were in the bar, we ordered 2 shots for each of us. The total bill was about $36. The drinks were not anywhere near worth that price, and the service was quite slow. I thought maybe it was just busier than it seemed, but our waitress was hardly ever anywhere to be seen. In the theater, the seats are luxurious beyond measure, but there is a tray table on each that can be somewhat annoying and in the way. The staff is generally quite friendly. The hosts at the front desk seemed a little snobby and pompous, but everyone else was very helpful and welcoming. This theater really was amazing. I felt a hell of a lot richer here than I actually am. Where is the downside of that? It was an amazing experience. I am already planning on another trip here. It's a great staple for a date night. I definitely couldn't afford to got here more than once or twice a month, and it's further than I would like to drive for a movie. If you want that luxury feeling, sit in your reserved seat, order a cocktail and some tasty cuisine, recline and melt into the most comfortable theater seat around."}
{"text":"I love this place, the bartender Brandon was amazing and I love the seats in the movie theaters that recline!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. A bit expensive, but we enjoy going"}
{"text":"This place is pure fabulousness. A perfect place to go on a date with your special someone or even with your friend. my honey treated me and he said it was just a bit more than the normal theater.. i have to say i was impressed and it is worth the extra money.  The chairs are relaxing and you get a pillow and blanket. 

We ordered drinks, blue moon for the husband and house red for me which I was happy with.  since it was our cheat food night we ordered 2 apps, the angus sliders and fish and chips. they weren't big portions which was good for us. great for sharing!  i did like the food & it was tasty.  if it's your first time to the theater- you should indulge in food & drinks for the experience like we did.  next time i think i will eat at one of the surrounding restaurants in the area prior to the show.  overall i really loved it and felt pampered on a Tuesday night."}
{"text":"The best theater we have every been to.  There is no where else that matches iPic.  We had a great server, Kolby.  He took care of any needs."}
{"text":"Ipic theater was great it was my first time it was an experience to be there with Hubby and the people there was very  nice a it a little pricey but we will be going back !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great experience, wonderful staff, very clean and well put together theatre. Food came in a timely manner. Staff often checked with guest to make sure there needs were met. Wonderful theatre!"}
{"text":"This is a GREAT looking place - incredibly posh lobby, small theatres with electric reclining seats (IF you pay for the premium), but it does have problems:

1. The online reservation system NEVER works - every time I've tried to use it, I just give up and call the theatre. On the plus side, they do answer the phone, are helpful, and usually get me the tickets I'm looking for. 

2. Apparently, guests don't rate clean blankets - several times I've gotten one that looked like a previous guest either blew his nose on, wiped soup off his mouth with, or... anyway,  it's disgusting for what is supposed to be an upscale experience. 

3. It's too dark to see what you're being charged for - they close out your ticket shortly before the movie ends and there's no way to really see what you're being charged for.

4.  Service is spotty unless you pre-tip - that is, I've noticed that the service dramatically improves with a twenty up front with a promise of another twenty at the end. That's more of a tip than a complaint; still, in a perfect world, I'd rather reward great service instead of having to pay a bribe for it. 

Anyway, the filet sliders are okay (NOT great) , but to AMC's credit, so are the chicken tenders and they're a fraction of the cost in a theatre where ALL the seats recline and can be had through an online ticket system that ACTUALLY WORKS.  

Granted, Yelp Elite reviewers who get treated to free movies nights probably get clean blankets and don't have to worry about closing out their tickets, but for the rest of us...I suppose we're just out of luck."}
{"text":"I found this place quite by accident. I went to Tanzy and this is right next door. I didn't realize that is it a whole concept and they are related. Salt, iPic and Tanzy. As a treat for my husband's birthday I got 2 premium plus seats. When we got to the theater the server gave us newbies the rundown. She said popcorn would be served all through out the movie....all they gave us was one bag.  A little bag. So I agree with the other reviewer that said you need a button to push for service because you pay enough to get more than one bag of popcorn. And a disappearing server..."}
{"text":"Super fun! I enjoyed that the theatre rooms are a little more quaint. Love the location, the private seating, and they also serve popcorn during the movie. Which is super neat! My husband and I saw \"A Quiet Place\" a few weeks ago and it was my first time at an iPic Theatre and now I'm hooked! Everything is well thought out. I can't see myself visiting a regular theatre ever again. We went to an after dinner  movie and ordered dessert. We both had the Creme Brûlée Cheesecake - so delicious! Id like to add that the bathrooms are super clean - which is a huge plus! I can't wait for another movie worth seeing in a theatre to come out!"}
{"text":"From the day this place opened, I was a fan. The whole concept I thought was brilliant and it was definitely worth the extra money.  Sadly, they don't seem to have kept up with demand and yesterday I felt that the $120 I paid for 5 luxury seats was far from luxurious.  
I see now that they are looking to hire an executive chef...this could be the reason the food was not up to standard. Service was extremely slow and food quality was poor. I did complain to the manager and he did not charge us for the food but to be honest? I would have rather paid and enjoyed myself...the evening was a dud. 
They may also want to consider purchasing some new pillows and maybe checking the seats for damage. My pillow was all lumpy and worn. Makes you wonder if they changed the cases from the last person who sat there????? 

Such a great concept with such potential. A little training and supervision should bring it right back again.  I did try to send a note to corporate rather than publicize on Yelp but there is no link on the website. They may want to add one in future."}
{"text":"Not very cheap but without a doubt the best movie experience. We always go for longer movies so we get the most bang for our buck. Splurge for the big chairs: they recline, you get to order food from your seat, and free popcorn with a pillow and blanket."}
{"text":"Great date spot if you want to impress. This place is THE primo movie theater. 

The perks to this theater: there is a huge swanky lounge area outside the theater where you can get great drinks. It is about $12 for a martini. Food is more reasonable and is served to you in the movie theater. You can also order more alcohol inside the theater. The seating is all comfy oversize recliners where pillows and blankets are available. It was a lot of fun to come here but I'll save it more for special occasions.

The only reasons I don't give it five stars is because it's $25 per ticket on the weekend. You do get popcorn included. Also, they said you can't use more than $50 in gift cards in one visit which is complete bullshit."}
{"text":"DO NOT waste your money here. I went to see a 11pm ghostbusters and couldn't even get popcorn because it was so late they had already cleaned the popcorn maker. This makes me upset because you spend so much just to watch the movie and can't even get what you went there for. They only care about one thing here and that's making the cash register ring not giving the proper movie experience. GO TO HARKINS."}
{"text":"I wanted to do something special for date night. I had heard great things about this place and for the most part it lived up to the hype. I chose the super premium seating and we had dinner during the movie. Awesome reclining seats and you even get a blanket! The service was a little slow and the food was over priced. I can't say I am surprised because this is located in North Scottsdale. I will definitely return but only for special occasions"}
{"text":"How can the suburban hell of PHX have a movie theatre experience like this?

1. Buy tix online (and pick your seats)
2. Walk into theatre and stop at the full bar for pre-show cocktails
3. Get escorted to your (assigned) seats
4. Sprawl out on full power seat recliner
5. Here is a menu for  food, wine and cocktails
6. Would you like a pillow or blanket?  Why yes, that would be lovely
7. Here's some complimentary popcorn while you decide what you want
8. I'll have the filet mignon sliders and a dirty martini belvedere
9. Excellent. Enjoy the show and I'll be back if you would desire more drinks or snacks

We need this in SF like yesterday."}
{"text":"The chairs are super comfy and was nice to have a pillow and a blanket.  The waiter was really friendly at first and said he would provide service through the whole movie, but he dropped the check halfway though and we didn't see him again. The calamari was awful, so greasy! Also, the waiter took the itemized bill out of the check after he ran my card. I think that is shady since I couldn't read it in the dark, it never got to see what I had been charged for."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this and thought they did a great job.  We got the Gold Class seating...which is way worth it.  The extra $3.50 pp gets you free popcorn and valet, so you've more than paid for it right there.  There's just something about having your feet up and sitting in a big comfy chair during a movie, with a glass of wine too, that really works for me.

As for the pricing, yes the food is expensive.  The extra $7.50 over Harkins for the ticket alone though is well worth it."}
{"text":"Must say, by far one of the best theater experiences I had.

The facility is clean and very cool to be in. Restrooms were all clean, the staff was friendly and courteous.

We live about 20 miles away, but make the effort to goto this theater especially on midnight showings. We don't have to wait in line for 2 hours hoping to get a decent seat when I can go online and order it, drive in at the last minute and still expect a good seat i picked. Which was adopted from California and all theaters should adopt this type of reservation system. 

 The seats are very comfortable, the premium lower grade seats are very comfy, but the top class seats are beyond awesome as I like to kick my feet up and enjoy a movie. 

The food was also delicious, just don't remember what I had.

Another reason to go for the movie experience is that less people, and the people who are going are there for the movie, not for their friends to talk or hang out as they pay a higher price scaring away all the annoying non movie goers. 

Overall, very satisfied and will be going back for more, especially Dark Knight Rises.."}
{"text":"What an awesome way to watch a movie.  This is a once in awhile place of your going to get the premier plus seats that serve you while at your seats.  A little pricey but worth the experience.  

The seats recline they give you a pillow and blanket.  You get your own server to bring drinks and food plus free popcorn.  Very comfortable very relaxing very enjoyable.  

Will be coming back in the future.  The food was good had the pulled pork grilled cheese the gf had a wrap that was good.  Must try"}
{"text":"Membership has its privileges! This is definitely the creme de la creme of movie theaters. Coming to iPic was more than a new date spot, it is an experience. Posh and plush!!!! The experience comes with VIP accommodations; valet, a server, popcorn, reclining seats (you go online and choose your seats) as well as a restaurant and bar/ lounge.

I took my entire office staff out to iPic and everyone loved it! Now, they all cant seem to stay away!"}
{"text":"OK, I was really hoping to not like this place because let's face it - $25 a pop for movie tickets is crazy, right?

However, I LOVED IT, I AM SPOILED FOREVER .  No other theatre experience will ever measure up now.  We saw Pirates of the Carribean 4, which was pretty much the summer brain candy you'd expect.  However, having a comfortable chair, service and drinks during was so nice.  As we went to an early show (dinner at Eddie V's after - separate review) we just stuck to the popcorn which was fine.  The menu looked interesting, however I would have liked to see some candy or something too.  That was offered at the counter I beleive, but not on the menu for in-theatre service.  Next time I'll ask or get some ahead of time, and there will be a next time!"}
{"text":"Decided to try iPic to see if I could get in to see Star Wars....went online, downloaded the app, selected movie time, seat and paid for it in just a few taps. Easy... Went in not knowing what to expect or how the process worked. Pleasantly surprised!!! Smooth as silk!! Found my seat, pillow and blanket!!! Wow!! Reclining seat!! Wide arm rests!!! Not a crowded feeling!! Personal service, free popcorn!! Huge glass of ice water!!! PERFECT!!! For future reference consider purchasing a gift card to pay for your food/drink choices...nice variety on the menus. Have recommended iPic to family and friends. Will be back!! 

Downloading the app will make your iPic experience even better...great venu, movie times, concept and service! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"This is a fun experience as long as you know that it's going to be expensive. The member price for the reclining chairs for a premier seating is $24. I took my niece and nephew so right off the bat I was spending $72. The food is good and quickly prepared but very pricey. The popcorn is free, which for the seat prices it should be! It's a lot of fun to sit and recline during the movie, and they also give you a pillow and a blanket, but I wouldn't make this a regular experience."}
{"text":"Comfy seats!  Good drinks, just pricey.  You haven't enjoyed a movie till you've enjoyed it with a drink in your hand."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I came last week to watch Bridesmaids on a Thursday night. We bought the tickets online to reserve our seats. The $17 seats (personal wait staff, free popcorn, pillow and blanket) were sold out, so we got the $14 seats. This place is located on the second floor by Narcisse and next to Tanzy (shares a lobby by the concession stand). That place was packed! The decor is posh and upscale, club-like, with plush seating throughout. We got in line to get some food and were in line forever!!!!! There was only one cashier and it took so long to get through. Annoying when trying to make the start of the movie. Anyway, they had a variery of hot food you could order, beer/wine, typical movie snacks, and a display case with additional snack foods (cheese/fruit, hummus and chips, tiramisu, salad, etc). My chips and hummus were $9 but I expected it to be a little pricy. To be honest, I wasn't digging the chips at all and would have preferred pita bread or pita chips. 

The leather seats were very comfortable and I liked the tray table that could be moved however you like. We really enjoyed ourselves and I think the experience was worth the cost of the ticket. They need to become a little more streamlined in the handling of their concession stand, though."}
{"text":"Four stars for classy decor, vibe, layout, and seating.
Why not five? The food served for movie goers. 
First- price: an order of Coconut Shrimp $14
32oz soda: $5.50
\"Truffle\" fries: $9
Total with tax : $30

Second: the food itself. Truffle fries?? Um, no. They were lukewarm, regular looking/tasting fries with shaved cheese (very little) on the top. $9?? Really??
Coconut shrimp were large shrimp and tasty. But not $14 tasty. Sorry.

The staff were friendly. But there seemed to be quite a lot of confusion getting food ticket orders together. There was ALOT of food in the window and about 4 or 5 guys checking orders looking confused. I'm sure a lot of that food arrived to the customers cold. 

Seating was comfortable. Bar and restaurant looked nice- darker with cool lighting. Didn't drink or eat in those areas though. 

Will definitely go back but I'm sticking to popcorn and candy from now on! Lol."}
{"text":"This place is all show in the front. Once you actually get into the theater its pretty basic.  

Place is clean, but the chairs are very uncomfortable if you get regular seating.  Generally I would pay for an upgrade but we saw Star Wars the premier night so we didnt have an option. The $17.00 \"regular\" seats sit straight up with absolutely no recline.  Its crappy to be so uncomfortable for 3 hours.  Given a majority of the seats are \"general\" not sure how they getvaway with it.  

Also the volume of pur movie was far too loud.  Its was peircing.  I have actually never experienced this.  My daughter wanted to leave half way through the movies so it wasn't just me. 

Dont waste your money here, go to Esplinade.  Cheaper tickets, all chairs recline and you get full bar and food  service to your seat no matter where you sit.  Plus they have reliable screen and volume quality control."}
{"text":"IPic is a fun experience for a date and a good meal.   This place is great to get your grub on and catch a cool flick.  At first we couldn't find it, but eventually we found our way, its upstairs and is a little swanky but you would expect that when watching a movie in this manner.

I ordered the fish and chips and they did really pretty good.

We got the Premium Plus Seating which is extra but I would recommend, since you are already there, you might as well as take it all in...and we did. The seats are extremely comfy, you can kick back and enjoy the show as you lounge back.

Also, the service here is delightful good to you, bar none.  IPIC YOU!"}
{"text":"I love Ipic. I just moved here from IL and was super excited to see that there was an Ipic out here. 
Anyway... This location has a beautiful lobby. I appreciate that there is more premium plus seating. I also appreciate the individual swivel tables. And the service was great. 

Only thing to improve are the upholstery. It's stained and kinda gross. I looks like they clean them as best they can; but that fabric stains. They should change to leather like they did at the Bolingbrook, IL location. It's cool enough in there so you won't stick to it."}
{"text":"Not your average theater.  We love the whole experience and we will come again next time we visit Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Literally the worst hospitality experience of my entire life.  I was using my phone to review the dessert menu as I was approached by a staff member that spoke to me so offensively I was left completely insulted.  Within seconds of being made aware of my phone light, I immediately placed it in my pocket.  Yet instead of thanking me for complying to his wishes he continued to lecture and speak to me in an unforgiving tone for minutes after and finished by asking me, \"If I'd like to leave the theater?\"  

At this time, I finally spoke and simply explained that I was reading the dessert menu.  Only to again be rudely mistreated.  Never once did he say excuse me, my apologies, I'm sorry, please or thank you.  Instead I was reprimanded and lectured at by a man the chose to speak to me in a highly condescending tone.

Thing is, I had no problem putting my phone away but the person asking should be respectful and ask politely.  Also I'm quite sure no one actually complained as we never witnessed anyone getting out of their seat and my phone use was brief.  Why not just be kind, honest and spare the paying customer the lies and senseless embellishment?

Long story short, I wanted to leave the movie halfway through.  Although this was a birthday gift to my mother and  I was stuck enduring the remainder of the film all the while feeling enraged.  The evening was completely ruined of what was supposed to be a very fun and pleasant celebration.  Not to mention an expensive one at that.  Nothing like paying someone well over a $100 for a movie so some jerk can treat you like  .  Needless to say, I will never return here again."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited the Scottsdale location last night and was really surprised by the lackluster service. We have been here plenty of times and was always met with exceptional service. Last night was terrible! Our meals were cold when we received them. We had to ask for silverware and were given them halfway through our meal. They completely forgot our condiments and never offered to refill our drinks. Terribly disappointed especially when we spent over $100 and was really looking forward to date night."}
{"text":"To be clear: the movie I saw was half filled with patrons. With that said--Love the theater but the service was awful. The building and the decor are gorgeous; Immaculately clean and no old popcorn smell. The premium plus seating was so inviting and comfy it makes you feel like you were at home( recliner, blanket and pillow).   That's pretty much where the wow factor ends for me. The \"complimentary\" popcorn was cold and tasteless but that was expected. The waiters took really long to even acknowledge us although people who entered after were treated with all sorts of pomp and circumstance. When we finally got the waiter's attention the guy did not get my order correct ( or the kitchen decided medium is the same as a well done steak) and took half the movie to bring a single glass of wine. I felt completely ignored and disregarded at the end. For what they charge, I expected better service to go with such a nice environment. My advice: order before and take your food /drink in; those waiters will just let you down."}
{"text":"Just returned from seeing Wonder Woman on opening night. Had heard this theater was very nice and thought it would be fun to go there and enjoy the reserved cushy seats and a glass of wine... well, not so much. Beautiful lobby, but the cool bar was closed on a Thursday night. So went to sit down early. Comfy seats, really not any better than the deluxe seats at AMC but they give you a small pillow and blanket. The wine came, the movie started, all was well. Till the large group came in 10 minutes after the movie started, and proceed to loudly discuss and order a full meal. I missed about 5 minutes of dialogue, but sure knew exactly what they were having for dinner. Worse, they kept turning on their phone in flashlight mode to read their menus. Seriously, it affected the picture quality - this was a small theater. And they did this several times during the movie. Totally ruined what I thought would be a great experience. And paying $16/ticket PLUS a $9 surcharge, I was expecting a great experience after shelling out $50. Never again. I know this really wasn't the theater's fault, but you would think ordering dinner would have to happen before the start of the movie, or at least have late arrivals place their order before entering. If you love movies and want a high-quality experience, this is not the place."}
{"text":"My husband, myself, and the in-laws were at iPic to watch The King's Speech in the Gold level section. 

The seating was ample (including reclining for my husband who is 6'1\"), comfortable, and offered everything a regular movie theater lacks. My husband had chips with blue cheese and I had a glass of rose champagne. The service was great and on point. I was skeptical before arriving due to the mixed reviews, but thankfully everything was great!

From now on, my husband and I decided iPic will be our choice if we have a movie date night. The cost of a gold-level ticket, if you're a member is $17.50 per person; totaling $35.00 for a couple. The ticket includes free popcorn. Considering the comfort, service, and price, you get the better end of the deal at iPic."}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE EVER. 
My date and I decided to come here for good service, food, and drinks. Because it's supposed to be \"fine dining\"? we paid almost $60 for our tickets, the movie started at 10:15 and we never got greeted. I waited till 10:55 to go down, miss part of my movie and speak to the manager. He has another server come up, that server realizes that We had no water, no free popcorn, and no menus. By the time we were greeted, the movie was over half way over. He bring us water and says \"your server will be right with you\" the server never came back. Then she decided to come up and say \"it's last call is there anything else I can grab for you\" as if she had already taken care of us. I'm not happy with the service. I'm SHOCKED that the GM didnt give us a refund or send something complimentary up for the terrible service. I'm in the bar industry I also work in fine dining. I know how guests are supposed to be treated but I've been treated better at a McDonald's."}
{"text":"Date night with the hubby... Ughhh where do I start. I've visited Ipic many times and have always loved my experience. You do pay extra $$$ for the comfortable premium seats, the service and overall experience. Why pay 50+ for tickets for your waiter to be gone most of the time and not even come by and check on drinks. I normally will have a couple cocktails however the waitress came over and was rude when asking what we wanted to drink. I ordered their prickly Rita and my hubby the Long Island... What do we get? Who knows it was gross. I decided to ask for a glass of wine and from that point on I never saw our waitress again.... Even until the movie ended we had to walk out the theatre and look for her to sign off on my tab. What happened to this place? No service, fowl smelling blankets, and unkept bathroom. Don't know if I will come back."}
{"text":"So yesterday was my first experience at Ipic and I must say I was not disappointed. Everything about the place screams luxury and truly was such a great experience from the waiters, bartenders, bathrooms and comfortable seating everything lived up to expectation. I would say the only negative would be that our movie started at 11:15 and we couldn't get into the theatre until 11:07 which made it feel a bit rushed. I like to sit relax and enjoy before my movie starts but other than that I truly enjoyed myself. I will certainly be back again!"}
{"text":"We love to see movies at the Ipic!  With that said in order to have a great experience you must take note of the following:  

1. Premium seats only!  The forward seats are very uncomfortable. The headrest pushes your head downward, so u get a terrible kink in your neck trying to compensate to see the screen.  
2. Waitstaff hit or miss! Let your waitstaff know u will settle the bill once the movie is OVER.  Twice I have had them interrupt the movie at the most climactic moment to discuss the bill?  You know: did I want anything else?  Should they put it on the credit card they had? Ect.  When you pay this much to see a movie, you want to SEE the movie.
3.  Some of the food is pretty good some not so much.  Probably still better to grab something at TruFood, Zinburger ect before you go to see the movie.

Best parts: popcorn served as part of the experience and covered as part of the price.  Reclining seats (although some of these are getting a bit ratty).  Having someone wait on you if you order in the premium seats. Also staff at front desk always very nice!"}
{"text":"After seeing so many positive reviews, I have to say I just don't get it.  I prebooked our tickets online, which was easy.  I was a little taken back at the price. $17 for each seat and they are not even the seats that recline. I was also surprised that after checking in, we ordered our own food and they don't bring it to us.  I mean for $17 a seat I would think we would get service, but apparently if you want service the seats are $27 each.  I don't mind paying more for good service and food, but this is a little off the charts for me.  Anyway, we were seated and then had to leave to get our food and missed the beginning of the movie.  We ordered the thai chili shrimp - very nice, the bite size nachos- vey flavorful, and a fajita quesadilla- all of which were very good appys.  The tray attached to the seat just holds the plate and they don't have drink holders- at least in these \"coach\" seats, so it gets tight.  The lady next to us spilled her drink because of the lack of space. And then you sit there and watch the movie with your dirty plate in front you.  Classy!    At least we saw a good movie. Overall, the ambiance is very nice, but for three people to see a movie and have some appys we were out $115.  With AMC and SMG being so close this place is the equivalent of driving around in a Hummer when gas prices are sky high. Why do it? AMC has lovely seats that recline and Studio Movie Grill includes friendly service in their theaters for no up charge."}
{"text":"Very expensive (about $16 a ticket) but absolutely worth it! An incredible movie experience. I love the huge leather chairs and in-theater alcohol access"}
{"text":"The quality of the picture sucked. Honestly, it wasn't even close to as good as my tv at home. Plus, the movie theater tries to screw you over when you book tickets through the website - the entire booking / reserve seat process is literally backward. What appears to be the front of the theater is actually the back. Therefore, we were WAY too close to the screen when we thought we were going to be in the back. It wasn't a good experience, gave us a headache, and wasn't worth 2 bucks much less $18.50 per person. What a ripoff!!!!!! If it wasn't for the buckets of beer, this experience would have been worthless. I will never go here again. Complete waste of money."}
{"text":"The new iPic Theaters in swanky Scottsdale Quarter is something to write home about, but probably only once in a blue moon, unfortunately. A cool experience or date that comes with a restrictive price tag for most folks -- if I didn't have free tickets, it would have taken a special occasion to get my butt in that seat.

What I liked:
- The atmosphere of the facility -- think movie theater mated with upscale night club.
- The seats -- comfortable recliners, but only if you pay for the upgraded \"gold package,\" which is really the way to go here. The 'regular' seats looked pretty regular. The upgrade gets you free popcorn, blankets and pillows, and waiter service. You can also reserve these seats in advance.
- Food and drink: nice selection, decent quality (especially the wine selection)
- The bathrooms were super nice.

What I didn't like:
- Prices: holy crap. You can easily spend over $100 for a movie date here.  The least-expensive glass of non-house wine is $12. The average appetizer is around $12 as well. The quality of the food did not meet my expectations for those prices. 
- Pretentiousness -- people dressed like clubgoers, rather than as movie patrons. Servers in the theater push you to order food and drink. 

Overall a cool experience, but I wonder how this place will sustain itself once the novelty wears off. I wish them luck."}
{"text":"Probably the most upscale movie theater I've ever been to. You'll definitely want to reserve tickets well in advance and if you want the fancy seats you'll pay more. 

Food and drink menu is quite lavish. I had a coconut/pineapple mocktail that was awesome. I would definitely order it again. My husband had a cocktail he enjoyed too. All of the food was excellent. Definitely pricey but you're paying for the service and convenience. 

Very nice place to come for special occasions!"}
{"text":"Gorgeous theater lobby almost like a Broadway theater. I had my own personal screening for Railway Man last night. No one was there but me. That was awesome. (great Flic by the way) I had a free ticket from a Gatsby costume contest last year so that helped. This place is very nice but hilatiously expensive. A night out here will cost you dearly between Valet, ticket price, and 15 dollar soda and dessert. I can not imagine if you ate here. That must be close to a sixty dollar evening.  So while this is very nice, it is an only once in a while treat. The theater itself is very swanky. You get a blanket, pillow and lounger chairs.( do not fall asleep lol) Oh yeah, and this might be an odd comment, but I find the bathrooms here breathtaking. lol-They are so, so nice.  See I still have a little girly, girl and Ny finery left in me."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to catch a afternoon movie, a rare treat with a two year old, and decided to go to the Ipic theatre. We had previously gone to a cineopolis in del mar, California, which was a fantastic experience. Unfortunately, this was not nearly as good a experience. 
For starters, the price was steep, even for luxury cinemas standards. This in itself wouldn't have been too bad if you'd get what you pay for. In my opinion we did not get that. The theatre is nice looking, and the bathrooms are modern and very clean. The staff was helpful with one exception, but I'll get to that. The absolute biggest disappointment of the afternoon was the seats. For $25 per seat I'd expect a comfortable seat and a Unobstructed view. I'm 6'1 and the handrail going up the aisles was blocking out the bottom corner of the screen, minor perhaps, but at that price I expect better. The seat itself was old, and either a metal or wood bar in the back of the seat was stabbing me in the lower back. I thought \"maybe it's just this one seat\", but nope, my wife had the exact same issue. It would have been comfortable enough if not for those bars. As it was though, they quite literally kept me from enjoying the movie. My feet were basically hanging over the woman in front of me, it was slightly embarrassing and uncomfortable. Thankfully we didn't have any feet above us, being in the last row, otherwise I don't think I would have stayed. 
The food, while expected to be overpriced, was tiny and a la carte. Fries are $9 extra. Ouch. Do I dare look what I paid for that cup of ice (with some soda to fill the spaces)? The service was decent, though I'd have preferred a button to call the guy, vs him just showing up during the movie at times.
$26 for a plate with a appetizer as a side and a piece of pie the size of my thumb. Ouch again. 
The movie would have been so much more enjoyable if those seats hadn't made my entire lower body go numb. Am I regressing?
Finally, the torture in the seats was over and we were leaving. While waiting for my wife, I mentioned the uncomfortable seats to the girl manning the podium where she checks your tickets. She looked at me like I was blank wall. I don't know if my comment just didn't register with her, or if she couldn't believe my audacity to mention something so unthinkable to her. Either way, she just gave me a blank stare and said nothing. I walked away. 
So there is a nice AMC luxury cinema in town? Guess where I'm going next time.
Sorry, but this was a fail for Ipic theatres."}
{"text":"This was my second experience at iPic and it truly exceeded my expectations once again. I brought 13 of my close friends to help celebrate my birthday watching Breaking Dawn (11/26/2011) in the Premium Plus Seating. As if huge recliner chairs weren't enough, the complimentary pillow, blanket and popcorn will win you over. During the movie the very knowledgeable and helpful staff served our entrée's and drinks only to be guided after into the Salt lounge where we had a table, appetizers and bottle service waiting. It is definitely a great spot for any special occasion! I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"The iPic experience is excellent and the venue is first-class. The negatives would be 1) the cost and 2) the service hasn't been as attentive the past few times we have been there.

Overall, I would still recommend it."}
