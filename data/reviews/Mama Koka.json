{"text":"Food was amazing! Everything was so fresh and healthy. Had the vegan falafel plate with all the salads and sides (minus the one with yogurt) paired with an awesome freshly juiced carrot-pineapple-ginger juice. Sam the owner is so friendly and nice and he is passionate about his food.  Definitely recommend eating at this cafe when you are in this side of town. I only wish he had a central/dt location!"}
{"text":"Tried their lunch special - shawarma sandwich. Although it appears small, it's filling and delicious. They make their own jalape√±o and vegetable spread which goes well with the sandwich. Great bang for your buck - $5!"}
{"text":"A gem of a place its understated and doesn't look grand but the food is delicious and always fresh!"}
{"text":"Not sure what pricing people expect, but I paid $11 for two falafel pitas (which is way less than any of the places I've been on Bloor), and they're crazy filling. Like the size if your outstretched hand, and stuffed.  The falafels were made fresh (as opposed to the warming trays I'm used to seeing), the toppings are awesome, and the couple who run the place are so nice!  It's easily the best in the neighbourhood, that's I've had anyway. A great place to grab quick and tasty takeout. The hours are a bit weird some times, but totally recommend you stop by."}
{"text":"Very tasty food a few different toppings for shwarma then are regularly available, also very friendly service"}
{"text":"Mediocre...small portions. Was coerced into buying something other than what I wanted...a little pricey for what you get. Looks closed of the time. Latest in a long string of meh falafel shops in this location."}
