{"text":"Service was rushed and the staff didn't clear the plates often so the table was full of piles of plates. This was towards the end of the night with an hour left of service. 

Last call was at 10 and the staff was turning down the restaurant even though closing is at 11. 

The food was ok. Some special rolls were interesting but the menu was about the same in quality and selection as other AYCE places. 

Overall, not a great experience and would not return."}
{"text":"I don't understand these low scores by the reviewers. This restaurant with its combination of price/ selection/quality and service is simply awesome. I come here for dinner regularly, w. two-three people party. We never had a bad meal
here."}
{"text":"This place is a gem of a find for AYCE sushi restaurants.  A close friend recommended this place to me and I've eaten at Yamamoto twice now; once for lunch, which I ordered the beef bento box -food for thought, beef brisket is the protein, I should have ordered the sirloin beef bento instead.  I went there last Saturday for my second visit with a few friends.  I chose  AYCE instead of a la carte; and boy was I blown away by the huge selection.  The sashimi was fresh and served beautifully on a wood platter.  I fell in love with the grilled mussels and the shrimp tempura rolls.  

The servers were friendly and quick in serving our food and clearing the table.  The restaurant is smaller than most places but I like the intimate feeling you get at a smaller but well run eatery.  

I am definitely going back within a couple of weeks."}
{"text":"A good AYCE restaurant to re-visit, but the price is bit steep. Just remember to ask the waitress for 10% off or an order of sea urchin sushi offer if you visited as a group. Remember to double check the bill at checkout to see if the offer is there.

On a more recent lunch visit, the services was not as good as before, they always missing your order, or cut your order in half. Cannot really communicate to the waitress, as they intentionally ignore you if you did not order too much, or staying for a long time.  Make sure you are a generous spender when you came here."}
{"text":"This is actually my fourth (maybe fifth) time here over the past year, didn't really get a chance to write a review during my first few visits.  If I was to have rated this place on my first few visits, it would have easily been 4 stars.  But, my last 2 visits, I had no choice but to give it 3 stars only.

At first, this buffet was on par with Tenichi (which I think is the best Jap AYCE in the GTA).  The last couple of visits, the quality went a little down hill.  From the sashimi to the cooked foods, to the desserts, things just turned out to be different.  

Very difficult to name all the dishes I ordered but, I always get all the beef dishes on the menu.  Beef tataki is very important to me, I will always order this dish at every Jap AYCE I go too.  This used to be pretty good, but the last two visits, I was just disappointed.  Seems like they got a bad cow or something.  It was not seared probably and the flavoring was just not there.  And speaking of bad cow, the beef cubes with garlic, lacked flavoring as well.  Beef short ribs was too fatty (and I like fat too) and very oily as well.  

Desserts... love the mango yogurt and ginger milk.  Not much to complain here, everything was normal and how I remember it was the first few visits.     

In terms of pricing, $64 for two (including tax and the automatic 10% tip) which is pretty much average for an AYCE place these days.  

Will I come back... yes, LOL.  I can't keep going to Tenichi all the time.

PS.  The special thing about this place is, they will give you half a grill lobster to each person."}
{"text":"It was alright. Not the best. Soup was a little salty and ramen were slight hard or raw. Either way, food came out fast. Would go again"}
{"text":"For Japanese AYCE, this restaurant isn't bad. We came here on a Saturday evening and was seated right away. 

The good: 
- Servers were overall friendly, and surprisingly, they didn't miss any dishes we ordered (never happens at an AYCE restaurant in my experience) 
- Sashimi - salmon was fresh, herb salmon had a nice flavour to it, scallops were tiny but they were yummy, octopus and sweet shrimp were good as well 
- Ice & fire maki - available on weekends only. This was actually really good!
- chicken cartilage - this was yummy! The flavour was perfect 

The bad: 
- Sashimi - red snapper, white tuna and tataki beef were all evidently pulled from the freezer shortly before serving. Felt like I was eating ice... 
- Wasabi mussels - this was just some tasteless wasabi mayo slathered on cold mussels 
- The desserts - the only ones I enjoyed was the mango yogurt and crème brulee. Everything else had a funny taste to it. 

Everything else we ate was fairly decent. The weekend dinner price isn't bad compared to the other AYCE restaurants - $26.99 + 10% service charge (be mindful of this because it's already included in your bill). 

Overall, it was a pleasant experience and will think of this restaurant next time we crave for Japanese AYCE."}
{"text":"First time trying Yamamoto and the experience was a total disappointment. Their lunch value meals were at pretty good price. The food was decent, not that amazing. However, their service was awful. There one waitress with rude attitude. She pretty much raised her voice at me and my friend. The whole experience was extremely bs. Won't come back or recommend this place."}
{"text":"Not worth it! We went on a Saturday at 5pm. Cost us $59.00 for two without any extras. Even with only a few other customers, they still forgot one of our orders. Fish is tasteless and the rolls are nothing out of the ordinary. To top it all off, it gave me diarrhea all night. Consider yourself warned."}
{"text":"It was my second time going there and my experience was far worse than the first time. I went in with a group of friends and we wrote down our order and gave it to our waiter. After 15 minutes of waiting we finally got 1 plate of sashimi with approximately 10 pieces of salmon (we ordered 30 pieces and other types of sashimi as well) and there were about 15 of us there. However, I have to say that the sashimi is very fresh. But there was also a waiter who was standing right next to our table staring at us and going on his phone, it was very intimidating and awkward to have someone watching you while you eat. Also, when we asked him what happened to our other orders, he said that we got everything we asked for and did not even bother going to check what happened. There was also a special lobster promotion when we went but after 2 hours of sitting, we didn't even get the lobster. I am very disappointed with what happened and I hope they improve their service."}
{"text":"Checked this place out with my parents, fiancé and brother. We had the AYCE dinner, $25/person.  
I honestly wasn't expecting much knowing the area, but it was decent. Grilled options were tasty, good miso soup, udon was a little salty. Tempura was okay: yam was great, shrimp had a little too much breading (as I find in 90% of inexpensive Japanese places).  Sashimi was passable; everything tasted fresh. Hand rolls and maki were a little small, but I think that can be excused given it was AYCE.  
Another reviewer mentioned the garish decor, and while I can't disagree I can't say it detracted from my dining experience.
Staff was attentive, tea was hot, soft drinks refilled regularly.
All in all, if I'm looking for Japanese food in the neighbourhood I would go again."}
{"text":"My favourite AYCE japanese place closed down so this being my second favourite became my next go to place. 

I like them for their variety in sashimi. Other places only have the usual salmon, white tuna, hokkigai, snapper  choices but this place includes scallop, octopus, beef and herb salmon. They even have sweet shrimp on the weekends, though I wish they offered that on every dinner menu! (If anyone knows of any other places that offer sweet shrimp, please let me know!)

Sushi wise they have the usual choices, their rolls are not too big. I can still fit them into my mouth in one bite so they're not stuffed with too much rice. I don't like their makizushi though, they're way too big! They have these vegetable rolls and rice paper rolls that are very yummy on the back of the menu. I actually did not know I could order them until recently. I wish they had more rolls like that because all their other sushi rolls, including their signature one are all too similar. They have advocado, a shrimp tempura, crab meat, etc and it's just a different piece of fish on top to change the roll's name.

They've changed their hot menu recently, and removed a lot of the things I used to like a lot about them. They got rid of their cold soba and their baked mushroom is now just stir fried mushroom with garlic. Their kalbi beef rib is gross, it's literally mostly fat or the worst cuts.

Service wise, they don't speak English. I booked a reservation on a saturday and spoke in English because the lady who answered the phone spoke English to me. I come in for my reservation at 8pm with my group and it turns out they never wrote it down so they denied having any reservation and offered to seat us at 9:30pm instead. I was so upset that day, not going to lie.

Pricing wise, they're a good choice on a week night if you want dinner. Also get the membership card for a 10% discount, which would negate that extra service charge they slap on top of your bill. They are really expensive on the weekends, for not much difference in menu options. The weekend dinner just means you can order sweet shrimp and 4 extra rolls that are not normally offered. Not worth the extra $5 per head."}
{"text":"It was my first time here. It was a typical AYCE sushi. Service was decent and the food was pretty good. The only thing was that our orders were wrong that they never brought us our sushi. Or when we ordered one dish they would give us two

A very good selection of desserts which I was quite impressed with."}
{"text":"Went there with my parents few weeks ago..
The food was just at the standard  of the Japanese restaurant

since there was busy and the waitress just brought us the bills..
just not happy about that ...we were not even full....~~just been there like 1 hour sth..~~"}
{"text":"I`ve probably been here several times already and they never fail to disappoint. Yamamoto is honestly never my first choice when it comes to AYCE. I would choose Matsuda or Ten Ichi. Yamamoto's fish is average at most and their food is decent. Sometimes it comes cold... hello? grilled? 

I went once for lunch hoping that I could get AYCE because when I looked online it said that lunch was from 11:30am to 4:30pm. When we got there (it was probably 3pm) we were told that if we wanted to have AYCE, it would be dinner price. We then looked at the AYCE menu and realized that it did say until 3pm. I went home to check online and if you click on their \"PDF\" of their menu you will see it.

They do offer bentos for lunch which are REALLY CHEAP! totally worth going for. Their fish is probably just what they use for AYCE but it isn't bad. All their bentos are under $10 which is great. I ordered 2 because I was starving ! hehe..

They have pretty much kept most of the interior from the previous restaurant \"Mongolian\" so there isn't much to say about the decor."}
{"text":"Super slow. Sat here for over 2 hours, missed many orders. Talked to managers, but didn't help. Some foods came, but warm only, probably sit on the counter for over 10 mins before they brought it over"}
{"text":"Good value but kitchen is slow.  Not many customers in restaurant yet food was slow coming out.  At five pm wait staff put pots of tea out on all tabled,  no wonder tea is cold and the pots they use are not thermos type looks like thermos but does not keep tea hot.  Wait staff was courteous.  A table of two having all you can eat had to keep asking where their food was."}
{"text":"My family and I's favourite AYCE sushi in Scarborough! The food is excellent, I would recommend the fried beef cubes (they are my favourite). Service is good and I usually receive my food within 5-10mins of ordering. The only downside is they only offer sashimi for dinner and trying to park can sometimes get hectic as they are located in a mall!"}
{"text":"Very high quality fresh sashimi for all you can eat
Great variety to choose from, food comes fast
Need to make reservations if you go during dinner time especially on a weekend because it gets really busy"}
{"text":"We had dinner there last weekend. 

20 minutes after we ordered, our first dish came, the rice in the sushi was undercooked and cold.

Whatever we ordered, it either didn't come, or came in many less pieces than we ordered, or took an unbelievably long time.

This is an all you can eat sushi bar, but the food and service were both terrible."}
{"text":"Second time in a week at this place.  Everything is fresh and taste fabulous.  Would highly recommend the place.  The lobster is to die for."}
{"text":"A la carte dinner with family for brother's birthday. I found plastic twice in the black dragon roll. My mom's shrimp nigiri was dry to the point where the skin was basically flaking off,  and my brother's sashimi was also so dry it looked pruney. I guess my dad's fried seafood udon noodles were ok to look at and eat though. I really wouldn't recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"Awful awful place.  We went to the Markham location before but unfortunately it closed down 6 months ago so we decided to go here for lunch on June 5.  We were a big group of over 25 people.  Firstly they said my daughter and nephew would be charge $6 each.   They r 2 years old!! All other sushi place r either free or $1.99.  So we place an order for food and all the cooked food came first.  All the sushi either came 1.5 hrs later or never came at all.  The salmon sushi was awful.   The rice was disgusting.   The salmon was so paper thin.  I never had sushi like this before.  Only the egg and salmon and surf clam sushi arrived.   All the other sushi never came but yet all the cooked food came. Unbelievable.  Never going here again."}
{"text":"One word to describe my experience here was disappointing.

First of all my friends and I had to wait about 15 minutes to even get a server to come and get our order. I'd understand if they were busy, but at the time we went they weren't very busy at all. 

The food was alright. Nothing to write home about, standard AYCE sushi and Japanese dishes. Not worth the high asking price of $33 after tax and service fees at all.

The servers were another story. They were rude and unprofessional when serving us. I don't expect you to kiss my ass when serving me, but at least don't give us attitude.
 
When we asked simple questions about some of the menu items and the last call for food all we got was sigh and an eye roll as a response as they begrudgingly answered our questions. 

If it wasn't for the already included service fees on the bill we definitely would not have left a tip. Regardless if the servers were having a crappy night or not there's no excuse for such lousy service. 

This is the first and last time we'll be visiting this establishment. 

P.S The Pokestops were on point."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Japanese sushi buffets I've been to. They have a lot of variety. In addition, their food is really delicious! I want to come here for dinner everyday but I think I will get fat..."}
{"text":"The best thing of this restaurant is soft drink.
The waitress acted really rude and threatened us that we have to eat all the shitty food .
They only gave us part of our order (except sashimi )on purpose.
The worst dining experience in all Canada so far."}
{"text":"Found great review and been searching for coupons. Found some in coupon booklet. Spent day browsing through the Pacific Mall today. Stopover for bento box for 4 of us 3 bento came out under 40 with 10% off. Great service and best fresh sushi as advertised and reviewed by other. Definitely come back again for buffet."}
{"text":"We came here last month-ish for lunch. We had the bento boxes here instead of the AYCE because we were short on time. I had the bulgogi bento box, and my mother got the tempura bento box. We also got some desert, because what's lunch without something sweet?

I think this is a chain store, and thought the Japanese-inspired decorations certainly helped set the tone. We had to go up and ask for the menu, but the server was otherwise nice and everything came pretty quickly. The bentos came with miso soup, salad, some rolls, gyoza, and rice - pretty standard stuff. Everything tasted fine and the desserts were cheap and decently sized for being $1-$2 (to be honest, they were probably sized for AYCE).

If it were up to mom, this place would be a solid 5/5. I'm slightly less of a fan because I found some mystery black edging on my bulgogi after I had gotten 4/5th of the way through it. Again, we were short on time, so I just picked it out. I hadn't tasted anything off, so I honestly have no idea what it could be. 3/5 from me, 5/5 from mom - averages out to this. 

We'll probably be back if we're ever in the area and want something fast to eat."}
{"text":"I must say, I do not understand any of the negative reviews. This place I great! 
We went here for dinner and it was delicious! There is great variety and the food is fresh and delicious. We ordered TONS of sashimi, and the order came out fast and was fresh. The tuna was amazing! 
The maki rolls are inventive and the teriyaki salmon is sooo tasty. Also, you can get free lobster, or 10% off, if you are a VIP member. 
I would definitely return here!"}
{"text":"The food and service are worst. The server left the food on the table even it was not my order. When you told them it was a wrong order, they kept saying you ordered it. None of the dishes tastes good. If you smart enough, don't ever go!"}
{"text":"It's over price for the quality of the food. Sushi is not fresh, the free uni tastes so bad because it's not fresh at all. The tataki beef wasn't kept in a cool place and it makes the taste so weird. For the same price I paid, I could easily find a Japanese restaurant way better than Yamamoto. I regret that I brought my friend there!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty fantastic. The pricing is about what you would expect from a decent AYCE place. 

I do recommend dinner if you have the choice as their menu expands exponentially from the lunch. The desserts are my favourite!

As well, if you call ahead of time for dinner reservations, you are entitled to free lobster and that's a pretty sweet deal on its own. 

The orders are fairly quick, and the staff (while some of them are not the best with their English) are very efficient. 

be friendly to them, and they will treat you in kind. 

Recommended."}
{"text":"Came here on lunch break. Their bento are cheap, $8-$9 will get you a decent sized meal. I ordered the sliced sirloin bento and they gave me sooo much meat. They also have the tea I really like. The food is good but not great. The beef can also be more tender. Will come here again for a quick bite in the future."}
{"text":"Good AYCE Sushi. Great Selection

If you're looking for a great all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant with a great selection of food to choose from, this is the spot for you. In addition to serving food you would commonly see at other sushi restaurants, Yamomoto also serves many other food items as well including Thai, Korean, and French dishes.  

In regards to sushi, what stood out for me was the house signature item 'Yamomoto roll.' It's a delicious blend of mixed sashimi on top of a California roll. It's a basic concept but you'll be pleasantly surprised at the novelty of the item and start to wonder how come no other sushi restaurants have attempted this sort of sushi concoction before. 

If you're craving for bbq, Yamomoto's has a great selection of bbq items such as the Korean Kalbi beef short ribs and  grilled calamari which I found to be delectable.

What really hit the spot for me was Yamomoto's good selection of desserts. I was pleasantly surprised to see an offering of  crème brulee, chocolate mousse, and durian mousse at a Japanese restaurant. Needless to say, it was a great addition and added an international tasting fare.

I also must note that the restaurant is decently spacious and clean, the staff is attentive, and all the food items were well prepared and cooked with a short amount of waiting time. Overall, the food wasn't the best I've ever had but it was still delicious which is why I'm not giving Yamomoto a perfect 5 stars.

At $24.99 for dinner for adults, it's not the cheapest AYCE sushi restaurant you will encounter, but you will definitely get your money's worth with their wide selection of food items."}
{"text":"This place was was fairly inexpensive and the food didn't take too long to come. The service wasn't anything special with the waitresses giving off a bit of a hurried vibe, despite the restaurant not being very crowded at the time.

I ordered the Tonkatsu bento, which came with rice, a few maki rolls, deep fried pork cutlet, gyoza, and salad.

I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of pork you get in the bento; they serve 2 slices of deep fried cutlet. Other than that, the food was decent, but I've definitely had better.

All in all, a solid place to meet with some friends for a casual lunch, but if you're a foodie, there's not much wow factor here."}
{"text":"Really good food and beautiful decor! Good quality food with a wide selection.  Great service! No complaint! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This is one of my most favourite sushi restaurants, the white tuna here isn't scam and it does not taste like processed butterfish unlike a lot of other AYCE spots, however with the extensive menu and the fast service this is a definite go-to for you indefinite sushi gains."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to go to Yamamoto for New Year's Eve and boy was that a decision we regretted.  We planned early and made sure we had reservations before venturing onward to the restaurant. When we got there we were seated quickly and noticed most of the tables were vacant; a few tables here and there. We were seated near the middle of the restaurant and next to a family on our left.

We scanned over the menu and got excited as we discovered a lot of our favourites would be available for order on the AYCE menu. After reading a few reviews as well on Yelp, I really wanted to try the chicken cartilage.  So we order that alongside a large order of beef tataki (20 pcs), some salmon, sweet shrimp, and scallop. We also order some rolls (spider and spicy salmon), and of course, some of the cooked goodies consisting of the baked seafood avocado, cubed beef, tempura, grilled squid, etc. 

We get our soup/salad orders really quickly, even before our pop orders arrive. And not soon after we start getting more dishes. Our sashimi order arrives and it's displayed beautifully. On a small bed of ice, it's thoughtfully plated and looks really beautiful. I'm quick to note that I've never seen an AYCE spend so much time on making the dish look this impressive. Despite the lovely display of food, the taste wasn't that great. The salmon wasn't the freshest and the temperature (despite being on a bed of ice!) was lukewarm. The tataki had the ponzu sauce on the side and we only received about 8 slices even though we had ordered 20. The ponzu was the same as the bottled Kikkoman's brand of ponzu straight out of the bottle. They skimped out on the ponzu which made the beef really dry. The slices of beef were slightly overcooked and starting to brown while the cuts of the meat were inconsistent and often chewy. The scallops tasted fishy and were difficult to get down.

After devouring our sashimi, we eat our order of rolls and cooked food. The tempura squid rings came out cold and were nothing worth raving about. All the other foods we had just seemed lackluster and we had disappointment setting in. We wait on our order of chicken cartilage before getting hungry enough to submit our second round of orders. We try again to order the cartilage which doesn't appear but we do get our other orders consisting of the seafood baked avocado, enoki beef wraps, spider roll, and some more sashimi (in hopes we get more tataki). I quite enjoyed the seafood avocado bake as this was my second round of ordering it. The creamy avocado melded well with the salmon and kami in the mix. It was nice and way and went down easy. Our second round of tataki ended in up disappointment as we only got 10 out of our 20pc second order. Again, it was inconsistent and overcooked. We were served the end piece of the tataki which was completely cooked and was more like a dry piece of beef teriyaki, minus the teriyaki sauce.

We inquire about the chicken cartilage and our waiter says that he can't find our order sheet and that we should just order it again. Frustrated, we try one last time for the order of the chicken cartilage along with our dessert.  As we receive our dessert, a waiter comes and tells us that it's our last call and inquired if we had any more orders. My boyfriend and I, still eating our desserts, were caught off guard and we make a small order of repeat desserts. We again inquire about the chicken cartlidge, and the waiter tells us that they're sold out for the night.... Couldn't this be something they had told us when we placed our first order? 

We check our phones and notice that we had only been there for an hour and 20 minutes. We check the menu for a seating limit and realize that it states that 2 hours is the seating limit. The table next to us that had been there since we walked in were still making orders while we were being rushed out.  Not wanting to cause a scene on New Year's Eve, we leave. As we're leaving, we notice about 6 or 7 tables that were vacant. Our initial thought was that perhaps they had a different policy on the holiday so that they could get faster turnover rates; however, after seeing the empty tables, it was clear that wasn't the case. They just wanted us out.

How disappointing that we spend $65+ to eat there on a holiday and we're the only ones being rushed out the door? Just like my 3 orders of chicken cartilage that never came, I won't be going back to Yamamoto. No thanks. Next!"}
{"text":"I think this place, while a dollar or two more than Ten-Ichi, puts the other AYCE in scarborough to shame. Honestly I went there by complete chance since we barely frequent Bridalwood Mall. I was not at ALL disappointed. It was spacious! The service was absolutely wonderful - they cleaned the table quick and were always available for questions, friendly all the way. The menu was HUGE with far more variety than we could handle (but OH we tried). The seafood portions were amazing and super fresh. Everything came quickly and tasted wonderful. There was nothing I didn't like, and I'm mighty picky. 

One gripe, however, is the staff didn't seem knowledgable about the exact ingredients in some of the maki rolls and it didn't list them on the menu so it made it difficult to order Maki. I obviously like knowing what sort of food I'm eating and have preference from one type of seafood to another. I highly suggest in order to cater to customer needs that the management change the menus to reflect what goes in the rolls! 

Also, it's 10% off if you ask them for their VIP card, but only if you have cash ( which we didn't). 

Overall, I loved it. Loved it! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Super large, long pieces of shrimp tempura. Dessert section sucks. Food is ok. Clean environment. Service is moderate. Nothing to wow about."}
{"text":"Food was good but service was TERRIBLE. I ordered a couple vegetarian rolls and had to order twice and remind them 3x before it actually arrived almost 2 hours in to our meal. They must've thought it was mistake because let's be honest, who orders vegetarian rolls. 
Anyway, they're ridiculously understaffed and didn't plan accordingly for service on a Saturday night.
There's potential here though!"}
{"text":"Sashimi here was really fresh. . They have albacore bc tuna and herbed salmon ,which isn't normally offered at other ayce. The 1/2 Lobster during dinner is really good too. A large variety of dishes, and very delicious desserts. Price is a little bit more than others though...and service was a bit slow, but the food was well worth it! Really good for ayce~"}
{"text":"Had not eaten AYCE jap dinner the entire spring term so I was really craving it. Also combined with high expectations for this place since I tried tenichi for AYCE lunch recently and the quality had dropped way too much to return to. Plus friend said it was pretty good and IG photos suggested the same. 

Interior seating wasn't large at all and the seats were really old with the fake leather covers peeling off. Service was nothing more than OK. Huge assortment of sashimi and all the fish were fresh. The beef tataki was kind of left in blood and not that appetizing. Shrimp tempura were nicely fried in a light fluffy batter. There was this special named kind of eel sushi and wow the eel slice was smaller than a fingernail and pretty thin. It also had a small piece of cucumber embedded in this huge dense cube of rice...My friend ordered seafood udon and it was HUGE in portion size with like one piece of each seafood LOL. Was most excited for creme Brulee...ordered it none of that came and they didn't bother letting us know it was sold out. It closed pretty early too at like 9 pm."}
{"text":"Yamamoto is definitely one of the better Japanese all-you-can-eat places in the GTA. From ramen to sushi to grilled items to desserts, the quality and selection of food is pretty decent. It was rather common that a few items on every one of our order lists that night were dropped (not fulfilled). Make sure to follow up if you're looking forward to a certain dish and it hasn't arrived with the rest of the items on your order list. They have an interesting reservation system that works on the premise of pre-defined seating time slots. Be sure to reserve in advance for larger groups - it gets busy! Yamamoto took over the previous Mongolian Grill establishment and not much has changed in terms of decor and ambience. The floor is fairly packed with seating tables but there's space enough to get around and not feel cramped. Hungry? Craving Japanese food? Check out Yamamoto."}
{"text":"Came here with my family for a milestone celebration after passing my professional exams. I have to say I am very happy with the visit. 

We came here on a Sunday evening, thankfully with reservations since the restaurant was booming with hungry Asians. Upon being seated, we were given a plate of  Uni Sashimi (Sea Urchin Roe) as a \"reward\" for making a reservation.  The Uni was fresh and the buttery texture melted instantly in our mouths. I recommend making a reservation before coming so you can enjoy a free sample of Uni as well. 

I'm not going to list the foods we tried since we practically ordered the entire menu, but I will comment on some notable and less notable dishes. 

To try:
Sashimi - all fresh, tender and sizeably cut. No complaints here. 

Maki - Average, however the variety of Maki choices available makes them worth mentioning. Try the chef's recommendations. Not entirely made out of rice, but they could be more generous with the meat and vegetables. 

Dessert - Try them all if you still have room after your mains. Mango yogurt is always a hit and their ginger milk is interesting (tastes like sweet tofu dessert with a hint of ginger). Crème Brule is what you expect at an AYCE, the flavours are there but the texture was more liquidity than preferred. I didn't try the durian mousse, but my sister in law who is a big fan of durian said the mousse was light and tasty.  My 1 year old niece seemed to like the durian mousse too. 

Sake - Since this was a celebration dinner, we tried the warm sake the restaurant carried and we really liked it. I usually find the taste of sake to be too strong but this one was good, the taste of alcohol wasn't too overpowering.  

To avoid: 
Steak - Steak of any sort, whether it be beef steak or salmon steak pieces, all were overcooked and dry. 

One other note worthy mention is the service at this restaurant. We frequent at many AYCE sushi restaurants and I will have to give this one 9.5/10 for service. There were lots of available staff on hand to take orders and make water refills. They were very accommodating when I asked for a seating area that would be good for a baby - we were placed in an area where there was less foot traffic. Food came out incredibly fast, so fast that I had to start distributing food to my family members in order to reduce the number of plates on the table. Only weakness preventing them from a perfect score were some of our lost orders. We had to put in an order of beef ramen three times before it arrived at the end of our meal.

Overall ratings:

Food - 8.5/10 for an AYCE
Atmosphere: 9/10 crowded as with any asian restaurant in Markham
Service: 9.5/10, see comments above
Price: $25 for an adult on a weekend 

Would definitely go back."}

The menu is pretty standard amongst Japanese AYCE, The service we received was extraordinary. There was at least 2-3 servers assigned to each area, so there was little to no wait time whenever we needed something.

One thing from their menu that's different is the variety of sashimi, and they all tasted quite fresh. 

The dessert menu was spectacular. It comes in little cute glass containers, and makes you wanna have one after another. The durian mousse was one of our favourites, but I really liked the mango yogurt as well.

They do take reservations, so I recommend doing so as this place can get busy sometmes."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times now and each time I was not disappointed. But then again I've only come during lunch time for their lunch specials and pretty much tried a lot of their bento boxes that had either beef, salmon or saba. Today I went and it was quite busy as it was peak lunch hour time. Anyway let's begin!

Let's start with service. All 3 times I've been here, their service was not disappointing. Pretty efficient and friendly people here. Helpful and aware for the most part, especially if you needed something. Food came out in a timely manner too.

Food from the bento boxes were good. Not too salty or oily. The only oily parts were the bed of vegetables that was always under the fish or beef. Aside from that everything was delicious. You also get miso soup when you go for the lunch specials.

The place is pretty roomy and can definitely fit a large crowd especially during their busy times. They are considerate and won't rush tables to pay the bill when there is a line up. However, when they have a table open after a customer leaves, they clean it quickly and thoroughly and have the next customers in line seated asap. Pretty impressive in that they care for their customers enough to be efficient but thorough with cleaning and set up but also with the current customers and not rushing them to finish faster. Sometimes they would team up and have 2 people clean up the table and set up for the next guests. Two sets of hands are always better than one right?

Honestly, I've been on the hunt for a decent japanese restaurant to make it a go-to when I want some decent jap food or ayce. I must say this place is slowly becoming that go-to...both service and food quality has got my attention. I have yet to try their ayce menu but from what I have experienced so far, I am definitely looking forward to it!"}
{"text":"the food is amazingly good! especially the short ribs, grilled salon and beef wrapped in enoki! service is fast and the restaurant is clean too! strongly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Very nice environment with delicious and affordable foods. Great place for a lunch break with friends and families."}
{"text":"I had a good experience here on a Tuesday night. Place was not too packed. Their food was as good as it can be for an AYCE place. 

I was surprised that they played and served their sashimi on fresh ice in a wooden box/boat. Not even many a LA carte places serve their sashimi on ice to keep it fresh. Nothing ran out that night even when the menu said limited availability, probably cause itbwas a Tuesday. 

What sold us to coming here was the scallop sashimi and chicken cartilage! They both did not disappoint. When ordering the scallop sashimi, you might want to order 10-20 pieces as they come chopped up in little pieces. The baked mussels were also really good. The herbed salmon was really good because of all the fatty parts in contained. The mackarel was also fresh and cut not too thin.

Last but not least.. Dessert! A pretty decent selection. The last thing that tempted to to try this place was the DURIAN mousse!! And boy did this NOT DISAPPOINT. the aroma was so strong once you stuck your spoon in the first time. If you closed your eyes eating it, it was basically eating a durian, from the taste to the texture. I'll be back just for the durian mousse!!"}
{"text":"The 4 stars is for their lunch value-- a delicious bento (minus the disappointing gyoza) for only $8? Any day! I recommend the Maki box ($7.50). Also, take-out service is remarkable. They are quick and friendly and serve you right away when you walk through the door. 

Did ACYE months ago, probably wouldn't do it again. They'd have to step up their quality-for-price game."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised! The food is really good and service is really good as well. The staff are all really attentive and pleasant (which is so rare for a Chinese-run restaurant). It's a new restaurant so everything looks very clean. I love the location and I'll definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Giving two stars for the good service, but the selection/food here sucked.

I'm from Los Angeles, and we rarely have ayce sushi out there.  There's one spot that's really good, and it's called Midori Sushi, pricey, but the quality of their food makes it worth the money (about $30 per person).  It was actually really surprising to see so many ayce sushi spots here.  Other than Midori, out in LA, we tend to assume that ayce sushi is subpar.  I think that the idea that sushi is being produced by the masses is a bit disturbing.  I would also like to think that because it's being mass produced, the quality of the sushi isn't that great.  

I came with a party of 12 or more, and I had arrived a little later than everyone else did.  My party had already started eating, so I only ordered my must have favorite rolls (a spider roll and spicy tuna roll) for myself.  I didn't want to order too much, because I knew they had already placed tons of orders.

When my sushi came out, I passed it down because those rolls LOOKED NOTHING LIKE WHAT THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE.  I was so confused.  I usually can guess what type of roll the sushi is just by looking at it, but I was just baffled.  I even had to ask one of the waiters what type of sushi it was.  

If you don't know what a spider roll is, its basically a roll that's deep fried and delicious.  The rolls were also tiny, might I add.***  But anyways, the spider roll wasn't even deep fried?? Or if it was, it wasn't done very well.  I only tasted a little panko, the tempura wasn't even warm.  I was so disappointed.  I'm used to the whole roll, not just a piece, being deep fried.  It usually takes a while to deep fry it, but it's totally worth the wait because the sushi is piping hot and just awesome.  I understand that some places don't deep fry the whole roll, but it was just disappointing that no part of it was warm.  

THE SPICY TUNA WAS WHAT GOT ME.  Spicy tuna is supposed to be a reddish orange color.  The roll that came out was PALE YELLOW.  It was hard enough to look at it, let alone eat it.  I tried it and it was not fresh at all.  I could really taste the difference.  I mean, how hard is it make spicy tuna, it's one of the essentials in a sushi restaurant!!

They had a very small selection of rolls as well.  I thought they focused too much on appetizers.  But this place really isn't a tradition Japanese restaurant AT ALL.  It's ran by Chinese people after all.  No racism bc I'm chinese as well.  But at a sushi restaurant?? You're supposed to be ordering sushi rolls!!  There should be a selection!!  

I also thought they cut their sashimi into too big of pieces.  I had also ordered calamari tempura, and the tempura was HUGE.  It looked like a giant onion ring.  I couldn't even chew it, they overcooked it and it was just so hard to bite down on.  

However, it came with dessert and to end this on a light note, the mango pudding was awesome."}
{"text":"The food was above par for an ayce place but the service was just terrible. We were a company of 7 and after we've ordered the food, the food came out pretty slow even though the restaurant was not full. Many of our ordered item did not come and the quantity was incorrect. Just after 1.5 hours, we were told it was last order really rudely and when we asked if we can order desserts later, they rudely with a disrespectful tone and returned with a 'no' in Chinese. Since the restaurant was not full at ALL, I don't see the reason for the rush. If they said it nicely, then it would have been fine. They rushed all the desserts and the hot food together and put it on our table at the same time!!! How can you eat ice cream and sushi at the same time??!! Bizarre service!!! All in all, not going to come back any time soon, even if the food is alright, having the rude service is just not worth it."}
{"text":"Came to this place because I was craving sushi. $13.99 + 10% Service Charge

They would occasionally mess up my order, but they would make up for it by having fast service. Nice decorations and atmosphere, but I didn't like the table placement.

Food was OK, would recommend the sirloin steak. Other than that, the only thing that was nice-ish was the tempura. They had a very wide selection of maki rolls which I was impressed with. I noticed that they pack a TON of rice onto their sushi. (Presumably to fill you up) 

For dessert, I had the ice cream and creme brulee. The creme brulee was very light and tasty, and the ice cream was exceptionally delicious. I was very impressed by the ice cream, would recommend.

Overall, I would come here again, but only because of the delicious ice cream."}
{"text":"Just a bit of an update on this place, it seems that despite the negative reviews, bad feedback  & lack luster attendance ..... the owner seems to think that the sign out front is the problem & has decided to add to the size of it, to the point of ridiculous - amazing that they haven't considered improving the food quality & price."}
{"text":"WOW, went there for dinner and had such a positive experience there.  At  $21 per person, by far the best AYCE Japanese buffet.  The food was really fresh, the presentation was top notch and really creative and the food choices were slightly different from your  typical AYCE that made it all the better.  The restaurant inside is very spacious also and very clean.  I highly recommend this place if you haven't tried it before."}
{"text":"Price increase to  21.99bucks for all u can eat lunch.  We were told there will be penalty if food aren't finished.  One person was rather rude."}
{"text":"2nd visit.
And will be my last visit.
Food quality went down hill... Barely 2
They missed alot of the items that we ordered. They send it to the table next to us.
We ordered two pieces of grilled fish, they send us only one. And next thing we know, is the table next to us whining that they can't finish 2 pieces of fish at the end of their meal, as they already finished dessert.

And one of the grill whole fish, the first time I came here, they cooked it really well. This time the fish was totally covered in a thick layer of salt. It's like I am eating salt with a sprinkle of fish.

Moving on..."}
{"text":"Very standard Chinese-run Japanese AYCE. Nothing really stands out for me here. Regular menu, standard price, waiters running around that you can't get the time of day with. 

I've been here a few times, first they give you a worn out menu and you get these little sheets of paper to write down the number and the amount of an item you want from the menu. My biggest problem with this place is that the communication path between the waiter and the kitchen is definitely flawed. We've made many orders and something is always missing or comes long after. For example we ordered the soup and salad first but it doesn't come until well after the sashimi and tempura. Of course 10-20% of the times you order never comes. And often we don't even remember what those things were. 

The quality of the food seems decent. Sashimi seems okay (but I'm not some sort of expert), tempura fresh and crispy, I love the yam and pumpkin. I really like the scallop sashimi here. The rolls seems okay. The beef tends to be a bit chewy but don't expect sirloin at these places. I ordered the baked avocado with seafood, it was okay it had fish in it, kind of weird. If you like unagi rice order more than one portion it's like a two-bite bowl of rice. Fried chicken wings are ginormous and heavily breaded. They have a variety of desserts: tiramisu, creme brûlée, ginger milk, coconut steamed milk, mango yogurt, mango pudding, green tea pudding, durian mousse, chocolate mousse and a variety of ice cream: green tea, mango, red bean, vanilla, chocolate, cappuccino. All seems pretty standard, I tried the coconut steamed milk doesn't taste like coconut more like milk and steamed egg. I'll come back since there's not that many decent places around and this place is big and you can make reservations. Also cause of the VIP 10% off discount. Unfortunately, washrooms are a bit dirty for my standards."}
{"text":"Though calling myself a sushi connoisseur is a step too far, I would gladly accept the title of Sushi Fan boy, or Supreme Sushi Enthusiast. Hence why when my friend with excellent taste suggested we take a trip to Yamamoto Japanese Cuisine, I jumped on the opportunity.

Yamamoto is a Japanese all-you-can-eat restaurant located within Bridlewood Mall in Scarborough. They've gone a long way to putting together a space that's imbibed with notes of Japanese culture while maintaining a present day feel. One of the things I love about this place is how much open room there is, so unless if you're in a blind rage from hangry pains, you're not going to bump elbows with anyone.

As I mentioned, I'm no AYCE nooby, so when it comes to the food selection, I'll say with confidence that I was impressed. I wouldn't say that the volume of items offered was anything abnormal, but most of the items were either delightful, or for a handful of them, amoung some of the best sushi and maki that I've had. Now for you genuine sushi connoisseurs out there, let me pre-emptively say, relax. I wasn't necessarily wowed by unprecedented freshness, or quality of meat, (though both of these were high in my opinion). Rather, what impressed me were some of the imaginative toppings paired with some of the special items. One of the notables for me was the Philadelphia maki, or the chikuwa maki. (I say \"or\", because I honestly can't remember which is which.) Also, a shout out to their cartilage skewers, and of course their actual sushi.

There is one predictable downside of a good sushi restaurant. You guessed it; the service. Leave your Canadian presumptions of being waited on hand and foot at the door. The servers keep it real and are there to get the job done. Not much else.
And heads up, by default they add tip to your bill.

Yamamoto is a great place to go to enjoy some AYCE Japanese food. Be brave and try out some items that you've never come across."}
{"text":"There aren't a lot of AYCE places in this area so it's nice that there is a decent sushi restaurant around.

The sashimi and sushi are super fresh and tasty. They have a good variety of types - including spicy scallop sushi, salmon rose and torched sushi.

The cooked foods were good as well but I think the sushi and sashimi is where this place shines. The pork katsu with curry is delicious, along with their skewers and meat dishes. 

This is a paper ordering system where you write down the number and the number of pcs you want for each item.

The service is good for a AYCE. For $26.99 each and a 10% service charge, I would come back for a good sushi experience!"}
{"text":"I'm an extremely big fan of sushi, and I love closest to this place. I can say that I'm not too impressed. The lunch deal seems more worth than the dinner deal, as the seafood sashimi doesn't taste as good as other sushi restaurants that I've been to. They don't have a large variety to choose from, which makes it not as worth in general. Most of the food isn't seafood or Sushi based, but mostly just chinese and Japanese style cooking."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I've had better sushi buffet and the choices are very limited. I don't think I'll be coming back here."}
{"text":"So the first time I came here, I was pleased with the service and the food selection they had for the All You Can Eat menu.  The restaurant is kind of hidden in the middle of the plaza and at the front entrance of the restaurant, they were doing a lot of construction.  I met up with a couple of close friends and we started ordering food right away because we were starved!  We ordered numerous of dishes.. to list some we had the Miso Soup, Tom Yum Kung, Wasabi Mussels, Shrimp Tempura, Sweet Potato Tempura, Chef's Recommendations (Snow Season, Jade Roll, Ice Fire, Kansai Unagi Sushi, and Creamy Philadelphia Maki), Tobiko Sushi (my favourite because they give you the actual fish eggs and they're not stingy on it), Squid Balls, Black Dragon Maki Roll, Dynamite Maki Roll, Spider Maki Roll, Spicy Sake Maki Roll, Baked Avocado Seafood, Baked Mushroom with Cheese, Baked Mushroom with Garlic Butter, Spicy Beef Udon, and the list goes on and on.  I thoroughly enjoyed everything and it's probably one of the better All You Can Eat Sushi Restaurants I've been to. So you're probably wondering why I rated Yamamoto Japanese Cuisine a 2-star?  Well, we came here a second time because we had a good first impression and the boyfriend missed out the first time we came.  So we decided to come here again so he could experience it himself but when we started eating, out of no where, I hear in the back of the Sushi Bar.. \"clip, clip, clip..\" and asked the rest of the group if they heard what I was hearing and asked them if someone's clipping their nails at the back of the Sushi Bar?  Instantly, we were all turned off by the sound because the sound of nail clipping is so distinct that there was nothing else it could have been.  We were so close to complaining to the manager or saying something and we were even considering not to order anything else from the Sushi Bar but we only just began our All You Can Eat dinner session.  We were even joking about whether or not we would an extra nail clipping or an extra crunch in our sushi.  If it wasn't for that, I would've rated this restaurant a 5-star, but that just disgusted me and I'm probably never coming back here again."}
{"text":"Haven't been here for years!
Not much has changed with the quality of the food. But the price, of course, has increased with inflation. Service was also spotty. 

Sashimi is fresh. Rolls made with just the right ratio of rice : filling. 

Serves it's purpose to fill and satisfy you.... but no \"wow\" factor."}
{"text":"Well.. You walk in, and get a good wiff of dead fish.. But once you get used to the smell its not so bad.
I was excited looking at the menu cause the options were new and looked so appetizing.
The beef cubes were not so good, not cooked and chewy .. 
The 'jumbo shrimp' is the regular small sized shrimp but tastes good
The kalbi is 98% fat, u may get a piece of actual meat on one of them if ur lucky 
The mushrooms with cheese is actually mushrooms and garlic. No cheese. All garlic. 

But on the bright side, the spicy mayo is LOVELY. Im a huge fan of spicy mayo and i loved theirs. 
& creme brulee is always a plus. 
The place is also big and nice. 
Service? Pretty good. Theres just one issue and thats that many of them do not speak english.. I asked for salt, and made like salt shaking motions when he got confused.. And he brought me soy sauce & looked deeply into my eyes with confusion.. 
Okay? 
But the english speaking one was very nice and polite. 
Overall good service

Would i be back ? $30 for dinner menu? 
Slim chance. 
Spoon & fork  and 168 is highly reccommended."}
{"text":"Came here with my family for my birthday dinner and it wasn't very busy in the restaurant for a Tuesday night. Didn't need to make a reservation. The place is spacious and I reckon it would be good for large groups. We took to a place in the back with the booths so it offered more privacy (and comfort) so we could stuff our faces to our heart's content (or stomach's, whichever you like). Service was fast and efficient, but not very friendly - a little bit detached and aloof, not quite looking at any of us in the eye when we asked questions and gave them our orders. But that aside, the food was good. My family and I ordered AYCE sushi. It wasn't the best sushi I've ever had, but very decent. I have got to say that I was very pleased with their sashimi. The fish was fresh and their portions were fatty and generous. I particularly loved the scallop, beef, salmon & white tuna sashimi. I think I would come by again, maybe for lunch. I saw the sign with their lunch specials and they're all under $10. As a student on a budget, I think I'm sold! If I'm in the area again, I'd come here :)"}
{"text":"I'm here at least once a week! I have no complaints at all! I will said this is best AYCE Japanese restaurant in GTA. And also, they got variety sakes. The boss, Joe , always have a good recommendation for the special side order and special sakes. 

Btw, whenever I want to eat Japanese food, Yamamoto always come up in my mind!"}
{"text":"Came by for their AYCE as I've only been trying their A La Carte menu.

Made a reservation at 630 - 640 PM and there wasnt many people which was fine with us. It was a pen/paper ordering so you write down the number you want and the quantity. The menu also lists how much they give for each section. Eg: Sushi is by 6 pieces. So you would put 1 order under quantity for 6 pieces or 2 order for 12 pieces.

Some of the servers need training as I find their attitude bad. When I asked for ginger while she was clearing the dishes, she didn't acknowledge me/my request which led me to be \"wtf\", but later on, she came back and brought the ginger. Another server acted the same way when I asked for another drink. The only person who really seemed to help us was (I believe) is the Manager. He was talking to some of the regular customers but he seemed the nicest and most helpful one out of all the servers that have attended to us.

Food was okay and decent. I like how it came fast... at one point our table was super packed with food and I didn't have to re-order stuff. Definitely recommend the creme brulee! Usually restaurants run out of those but not this time at Yamamoto's.

Note: The menu that they broadcast outside is different than the one they serve in the restaurant. We were fooled to think some stuff were offered like the Durian Mousse but they have changed the menu. Also, if you took a picture of the menu outside, please DO NOT use THOSE numbers while ordering as it is totally different from the ones in the menu."}
{"text":"My husband and I usually go here for their bento boxes since I always craved about my old sushi restaurant in California that served similar bento boxes. When we first tried it it is actually great for its price and they gave me bigger proportions compared to my old sushi place. When we came back to Cali a few weeks ago, we visited my old place and tried it with my husband to compare, and Yamamoto was way better than the one in Cali! I always loved their pork cutlets and curry while my husband loves their assorted sushi bento and the tempura.

The location is very convenient since its in the middle of the mall and the place is huge and you will see that theres alot of people who stop by here to eat. Their service here is very fast since I dont usually wait for too long for my food not like other restaurants. The waiters are also attentive to your needs.

We really like this restaurant and we hope it stays the way it is."}
{"text":"3 stars.

Big space. Decor is new, yet very woody and dark. I believe it used to be a Mongolian grill and they salvage whatever they can to turn it Japanese. Nice and different.

Food was overall good. Sushi and rolls are fresh and good. Garlic steak was juicy. Chicken wings was heavier in taste than the average AYCE wings. Baked avocado salad (forgot exact name) was good, but the one from Tenichi is a lot better.

Service was quick and servers were very friendly. They make effort to say thank you and you're welcome each time they bring you something and you say thank you to them. My server also lay down the items with great gentleness and caution :) They  also took good care and appeared friendly to a group that was doing a company party lunch.

I was very happy and satisfied with this place until I checked out their washroom (ladies room).

Washroom was probably the most atrocious I've ever seen. There was a lot of what looks to be old spots of urine and feces all over the toilet seats! I'm puzzled because 1) it's early lunch time, hadn't even got very busy yet so toilets should be in top shape if you just opened and was clean the night before or before you opened 2) the spots were dried and old, so it wasn't new, probably accumulated for days...so it's been awhile since they cleaned?...ewww....how hard is it clean it daily? or if it's been cleaned, why the stain still there?? gross...if the stain don't go away, then change the seats..just nasty! 3) the stalls are dark and the floors was I think stone finished...makes me wonder how much other old feces spots are around me and am stepping on....ah!!

I can't believe it's such a contrast to the settings and feel outside. Dining room feel like they care a lot. Washroom. *shake head*  :(

Kind of sad considering the food and service is pretty good, but I'm disgusted every time I think of that washroom. It's a washroom to remember, and not in a good way.


As strange as this may sound, I would probably still go back there again, but use the washroom with caution, if I must, maybe after I eat so I don't ruin my appetite :) I hope they fixed the issue."}
{"text":"I come to this place all the time. It used to be a lot better and cheaper. 

I got the Yoshinoya's beef bento box, which was cubes of marinated beef briskets. It was tender and juicy, but stew-like / mushy. Not for everyone.The miso soup and sushi is standard. But the salad is yellow. It was $9.99 and the same size as the lunch portion, but just $2 more.

There's no ice cream. The waitress seemed cold / a bit rude. The portions have gotten smaller and smaller. The slices of salmon are thinner and thinner. This used to be my favourite place to go for sushi. This place has dropped off. I think it's only worth it if you go for lunch ... and that's not a guarantee."}
{"text":"First time trying Yamamoto at Bridlewood Mall. We opted for AYCE Dinner. The Mister the Missus were thoroughly disappointed.

Food - mediocre at best
Tried a lot of the items on the menu, nothing special. Same as all AYCE sushi joints. Chef's recommended items were a disappointment.

Service - lackluster 
Servers were not personable. Needed a lot of hand waving to get attention and noticed other tables were doing the same. Only 6 tables occupied, slow traffic, no reason for long wait. When they deliver food on the table, the plates were roughly handled.

OVERVIEW:
* Some of the food we ordered never came.
* Dessert was the redeeming part of dinner. Above average for standard AYCE sushi places.
* Lots of space and elbow room. Brightly-lit interior. Sparse decorating. (Mister does not think this should be included on here)
* GRATUITY WAS sadly AUTOMATIC"}
{"text":"I think this is probably one of the better ayce. They have a good array of different types of Japanese/ Korean food and it always comes out at a timely manner. The quality is also pretty good. Can't complain"}
{"text":"Poor customer service. They forgot to include chopsticks and soy sauce with my take out order, and questioned me when I returned 5 minutes later to grab these items. The funniest part is that the girl who took my order was oblivious to what was going on.

There oysters were not as fresh this second time around."}
{"text":"Went to this place with my family and overall had a larger group. which as we all know is the best way to experience all you ca eat buffets. Now onto the food. The sashimi at this place was actually pretty good. The fish was decent and fresh and the herb salmon was a nice touch. The sushi and maki rolls however was definitely something i would not try again, as it was not really that good in terms of rice make up and combination of materials. 

the cooked food here was not bad. they had a lot of interesting options, and although it doesn't always work out, i do applaud them for trying. The wasabi mussels were pretty good for what it is. 

The overall atmosphere of the place was good. as it is spacious and had a lot of room. However the service was bogged down to be quite a bit slower at this dinner time on a monday. The food took longer to arrive then most locations. 

The deserts i would suggest try to creme brule, although not hot, it is a decent selection of desert, and there overall desert selection is not bad. 

If in the area this place is definitely not a bad option but i would not go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"First off, let me say... if you consider yourself to have pretty liberal standards when it comes to food freshness and quality, you're going to think I'm being a bit too harsh. But... that is non-negotiable for me particularly when it comes to sashimi. I'll try to keep this simple. We were a party of 8 that made reservations for a birthday dinner.

Pros: 
- Lots of seating space.
- Fast, efficient service, with a pretty typical level of friendliness from a Chinese-owned AYCE
- Decent selection of foods
- Generously-portioned food
- Hot-food items were tasty and well-prepared
- Surprisingly good desserts (ginger milk, creme brulee, etc).

Cons:
- The sashimi and sushi items were definitely NOT fresh - in terms of taste, appearance, smell. ..  On orders where there was minced fish (e.g. tuna/salmon) like on their House Yamamoto Roll and \"birthday pizza\" it was positively revolting - so fishy it was making me nauseous, and our party of 8 agreed as well.
- The presentation of the food was at times comical. Partly it was due to the freshness of the food, but also because of an unfortunate \"more is more\" approach.

I don't know anyone who goes to AYCEs to eat JUST hot food (i.e. no maki,sushi, sashimi etc.), but if that's your style by all means this is actually a pretty good place. If you enjoy quality seafood though, run the other way! There are tons of other Chinese-owned Japanese AYCE's better than this place."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed with this restaurant. My friend had a birthday party here. I looked at the menu and there is no unagi sushi? Only hand roll ? No salmon belly? The choice is so minimal. The service is pretty good since it wasn't that many people."}
{"text":"Last call on the menu is 10pm. Came in just before 9. The first waitress said last call is 9:45. The second waitress said last call is 9:30.....okay. We are in a party of 5 so it wasn't like we weren't going to spend.
Food was not like the original location at all....sloppy and gristle filled. The taste was unremarkable even for AYCE. 

The one waitress kept hacking a lung...lovely.  Not only that but their customer service was pretty awful....literally chucking dishes of hot food haphazardly and almost knocking food onto us.

Anyways being rushed from beginning to end this was certainly a shame.  If you want the proper Yamamoto go to the Kennedy location. Avoid this one please!!!! I'd be amazed if this location stays open...."}
{"text":"Service was bad, crappy menu and awfully expensive for the awful food they serve! Not impressed! 23.60 for one for lunch with tax and a service charge thats included-.-"}
{"text":"Don't bother walking in without  a reservation on the weekends, basically got turned away at the door and told that it was a least going to be a two hour wait until I would be seated. Even though half the restaurant was empty was pretty shocked. Nice that they honour there reservations so fiercely but disappointed nothing could have been done for my case. I was simply looking for a table for 2."}
{"text":"This is one of the better AYCE options in Markham.

1.  The food was above average for AYCE.  Their extensive menu gives you a lot of food to choose from - more than most AYCE's.  The sashimi/fish was very fresh and served on ice - though they usually gave us fewer pieces than the amount we ordered.  

2.  The service was nice and prompt.

This is what you should be getting for $30+; Yamamoto sets the standard and serves as a good yardstick for all AYCE's.  Will def. return, but will probably try other critically acclaimed AYCE's first."}
{"text":"Yamamoto Japanese Cuisine used to be located in Pacific Mall, but I heard that this location has been open for quite some time now as well. When you drive into Bridlewood Mall, expect to drive to the back of the mall until you see a big white sign that says Yamamoto.

We made reservations on a Saturday night at 5:30pm, not a lot of people eat during that time, so many seats were available. The restaurant did begin to fill up at around 7:00pm.

Adult prices for weekends and holidays (dinner) is $26.99, (lunch) is $16.99. On weekdays, dinner is $24.99 and lunch is $14.99 for all you can eat!

There were a lot of options of food, that came at a fair speed, though the sashimi came really slow. It basically came after every other food dish we ordered during the first round. 

Two things I really liked are their desserts as well as their soft drink availability. Often, soft drinks are extra the price. The desserts came in glasses that were a little wider than the tall shot glasses, though the sizes were the same. (So if you're used to ordering the desserts from Tenichi or Matsuda, make sure you divide the number you want to order by half. 

Their sashimi and rolls were average, but I really liked their grilled items - the Saba and Sanma were one of our favourites of that night (though I do know some other people won't be big fans of grilled fish)."}
{"text":"I went here last year and the reason why we put off coming here for the longest time was because the service was well, horrendously bad. We were rushed to pay the bill, were constantly told that the last call for orders was our next order (even though it was 6 PM) and a specific waitress was very condescending and rude.

But that was last year. So we decided to give it another go, this time for AYCE lunch ($15ish I believe). Again, we were rushed and they were very pushy about us leaving. The waitress asked us for payment by saying \"CARD or CASH\" as we were in the middle of eating food.  

There's nothing wrong with the food (the menu for lunch may be a little bit limiting..), and it was actually quite good, but the service alone is enough reason for us to never go back ever again."}
{"text":"Yamamoto is a fairly standard Chinese run all you can eat. Most of the things on the menu are alright, but not terrible or outstanding.

Lowlights:
- I was surprised to see scallop sashimi was on their weeknight and weekend menus. Usually, this is a weekend only thing. It turns out that Yamamoto doesn't do regular sized scallop sashimi. They serve raw bay scallops. I've never seen that at any Japanese restaurant. I'm not saying it can't be authentic. It just wasn't what I was expecting, and it didn't taste like much.
- They have mushrooms in cheese sauce on some of their menus. On other menus, it's crossed out. My menu said cheese. I ordered it twice. I got garlic butter twice. Disappointed. 
- Mussels and cheese (I believe it said cheese), was more of a spicy cream sauce than actually cheesy. I don't mind spicy cream, but it was misleading.
- Ginger milk pudding or whatever they call it on the dessert menu is very strong on the ginger, and not sweet enough.
- steamed coconut milk pudding or whatever they call it on the dessert menu does not taste anything like coconut. It tasted like slightly sweetened steamed egg whites. While I enjoyed it, it was also misleading.

Highlights:
- their beef cubes with garlic were tasty. 
- their beef tataki was tasty.

Good and bad:
- they have sweet shrimp sashimi on their weekend menus. They started off fairly decent, but as the night progressed, the shrimp sashimi they sent us progressively got slimier and more bland. That's not a good sign either.

Funny:
- pop is included in the dinner price. My friend asked for sprite. The waitress didn't know what she meant. We said soft drink, and she said they had iced tea. My friend asked for sprite again. She still didn't know what my friend wanted. She then listed out the soft drinks they had, including sprite. Then, my friend ordered her sprite. I have no idea what the issue there was...

Would I come again? I wouldn't recommend it, but if someone was having a party here and invited me, I'd still come."}
{"text":"The best thing is the service, the waitresses are way nice and they even thank you almost every time after they bring you the food. Food is good. It's a bit pricey though, but then again, so is all ayce sushi."}
{"text":"Really good AYCE sushi! And reasonably priced too! Our server was very accommodating and professional, which was a pleasant surprise considering how many AYCE places have practically no service. I will most definitely be coming back here when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"The sushi wasn't fresh and the gyoza was cold. It took a while for the staff to even notice we entered the restaurant. Both my boyfriend and I order bento boxes and although they were very cheap ( mine was $7.99 and his was 8.99) they weren't good at all. I didn't even want to eat the salad because the dressing looked like vomit and the greens looked old and wilted."}
{"text":"This place was such a good find.
I went here on theSunday night of a long weekend.

The place is really big and we were seated immediately.
All you can eat dinner was about $25 which I expected for a Sunday.
I don't know if it was because it was Canada day weekend but every table got a free lobster! It was delicious. I was so happy.

I loved the miso soup and salmon rolls. I especially liked the spicy salmon, it had big chunks of salmon.
The herb salmon sashimi was a big hit with my boyfriend and I.
Everything was delicious, the only thing I didn't love was the philidelphia roll which I usually do. It was fine though. Everything else more than made up for it.

I had a great time and dinner was a great experience.
They also had creme brulee for dessert, which my boyfriend had THREE OF! He also said the grilled teriyaki salmon was the best he'd had so far!

The 10% gratuity was included on the bill (which is stated clearly on the menu).

I would definitely go to Yamamoto if you're in the Pacific Mall area!"}
{"text":"What was once the location of the Mongolian grill on the outside of Market Village is now an all-you-can-eat (AYCE) sushi restaurant. Inside you feel like it's little villages as the decor kind of has this old-style Japanese thing going on that many restaurants in Toronto like to do with bamboo, flowing water and images of Japan old-styles.

Generally I'm not into AYCE but sometimes you just feel like a mouthful of sushi and sashimi and you're ready to try it again. Of all the types of AYCE restaurants, Japanese is always me favorite though as the variety that Japanese cuisine has to offer can satisfy anyone from sushi to noodles, from sashimi to pork cutlets, from hand rolls to dumplings and rice. Generally you should be able to find something you can enjoy.

What sets this place apart though is it has quite a good selection of specialty items like beef sushi, seared sushi, fried items like scallops and fried bananas for dessert. You might also want to try the durian mousse for dessert. While purists might complain that there isn't enough durian flavor, I think it has a nice balance of durian flavor and nothing too overtly offensive. For those who don't like that, might want to try the ginger-milk shooter dessert, another good one!

So why is this a 3-star, well it's still an AYCE, we're not talking very high end and high quality fish. But I'd say it's quite good for AYCE, perhaps above average. Though the price is also a bit up there at $25.99 for adults on a weekend."}
{"text":"This spot has been lovely and one of my favourites to eat at for lunch. I usually come here for their bento box lunch specials and I'm not tired of them. For the price I'm getting it at, I'm really satisfied with what I get. Portions aren't too small or too much. 
When I come here, it isn't too busy and the service is fairly quick and they're super friendly. Always had a good experience here!"}
{"text":"Came here for CNY dinner instead of the usual Chinese restaurants...this was my first time here so after reading reviews I was a little concerned...but alot of places were fully booked. Therefore gave it a try... 

the bad about AYCE: difficult to get a server becuz they didn't hire enough ppl, they Double up portions upon their own discretion and not your requests and the 10% tip rule... 

Now the goods about AYCE: EAT until u wanna throw up (literally ), the number of choices messes u up, and no one will argue whats better than what.. to each its own... 

Price was slightly better, @ $22.99 per person... thankfully we booked in advance cuz it was packed at the door. 

Choices, choices and more choices:  salmon sashimi wasn't that fresh by the colour, it was quite obvious..+0.5 star for having octopus sashimi which is relatively rare at an AYCE. They also gave us FREE * UNI for CNY... but not so fresh...oh well...

the cooked food: fried tempura shrimp  grilled shrimp was all an A-Ok... one weird one was the fried  squid balls if thats what its called.. they fried it with tempura batter.. which was awkward...never had anything like it... -0.5 star..

Service was generally ok since it was CNY, and almost everyone was going out to have dinner... food came quickly but pickup for empty plates was slow...

Overall, I may come again...hoping for more positive reviews..."}
{"text":"3.5ish.

Came here as a group of 5 for dinner. Overall the sashimi and sushi was pretty fresh, they have a nice variety as well. I didn't come with high expectations because I've been here for non-ayce and this place is definitely nothing special. 

Let's talk about their food, so aside from the sashimi and stuff being pretty fresh, their cooked foods were also pretty good. Nothing tasted bad honestly but there are some items on the menu that don't really belong there... For those that have seen it will know, the \"sushi rice\" they have shown on their most popular items looked pretty good. It's actually just a sad ball of rice that came out as a deformed triangle. In general though the food was pretty good so yeah. 

What I didn't like about this place was this one waitress that kept saying LAST CALL ORDER NOW, kept coming by and telling us that. It was only like 9:15 or something. Like chill okay? 

Verdict: good OK. 
In general, the food was pretty good. It's what you expect when you go to an AYCE place, which is completely fine. The place was packed but food still came relatively quickly so no complaints there either. So give the place a try! 

That's all."}
{"text":"My cousin recommended this place for us the other night to eat at for AYCE sushi. It was a cousin's night out and we were all craving sushi, so go figures!

When we arrived to the restaurant, we actually had to wait for a bit before we got a table and it was only the three of us. They said it'd take about half an hour but we ended up getting a table in 15 minutes, which isn't all that bad! (the bigger the group, the more difficult it was to get a table, I am assuming)

Walked in, super spacious and the ceilings were high. The restaurant was packed for a Thursday night and almost all of the tables were occupied with people.

The service was great but the waitress should learn to smile more often because great customer service is what keeps folks coming back, always! (Unless the food is bad, then that's another story...)

The decor was very standard, nothing fancy. Dark wooden tables and little Japanese articles to make the restaurant feel Japanesey (but you can totally tell that it's run by Chinese people, not that it's a bad thing!)

On to the food, oh boy, the food was great! The salmon sashimi pieces were incredibly generous. They were thick and the slices were huge. I was almost full just by eating pieces and pieces of the salmon sashimi. Aside from the thick slices of salmon sashimi, they had \"Herb Salmon\" and it's honestly the BEST thing that's on the menu aside from the spicy salmon nachos, which is what I'll be discussing about next. The herb flavour infused into the salmon sashimi pieces were so delicious and you can really taste the herbs too and when you squeeze a little bit of that lemon juice on it, it's incredibly tasteful.  Besides the herb salmon, you've gotta definitely try the \"Spicy Salmon Nachos\", these little bite-size goody goody goodness are super tasty! It's like tex-mex infused Japanese cuisine, it was absolutely delicious and the flavour profile worked so well together. Not a lot of people will like it but I definitely loved it and it was the highlight of my dinner.

The rest of the menu were pretty standard, nothing fancy, nothing too spectacular. 

Overall, definitely give this place a try and it'll be worth your money. It's looking to be one of my favourite AYCE spots to hit up if they do manage to keep the food exactly like how I had it the next time I go. They lack good service but hey, the food's going to keep me going back."}
{"text":"Menu: http://yamamotogroups.ca/dinner.pdf

What we had: 
Appetizers: grilled (not so jumbo) jumbo shrimp, chicken cartilage, miso soup, shrimp tempura, curry cuttlefish, grilled squid, yoshinoya's beef, baked avocado seafood 
Rolls/Sushi: snow season, jade roll, kansai unagi sushi, unagi avocado maki (grilled eel and avocado roll), black dragon roll, spider roll, salmon rose, salmon sushi, white tuna sushi, chopped octopus sushi, spicy salmon sushi, spicy tuna sushi 
Sashimi: salmon, red snapper, white tuna, beef, octopus, herb salmon, scallop
Dessert: green tea ice cream, mango ice cream, mango yogurt, amber cake, mango pudding, green tea pudding, chocolate mousse, durian mousse, creme brulee
(This was over multiple visits, we don't eat THAT much.)

Taste: 9/10
Appetizers are good in general. Steven really likes the chicken cartilage and the yoshinoya's beef. I was excited about the grilled jumbo shrimp but it turned out to be just regular sized shrimp. It was still good. Curry cuttlefish could use more salt. Baked avocado seafood was quite heavy.

The special rolls are really good (snow season, jade roll were unique, black dragon and spider rolls are good too). Their sushi have a good fish to rice ratio, and the fish is fresh. The dinner menu has a nice selection of sashimi, including scallop sashimi that I've never seen at other places before. Steven likes the beef sashimi and the herb salmon sashimi (salmon sashimi marinated in some lemon juice and herbs). The scallop sashimi is tender and slightly sweet, though no matter what quantity of it you write down on the order sheet, they only give you a small lump of it. 

Desserts here are pretty much the generic AYCE sushi desserts. Mango yogurt is really yummy (I had 10 huehuehuehue), and so is the creme brulee. The amber cake is really a jelly with goji berries in it, wasn't so great. Puddings and mousses were pretty on point.

Value: 7/10

Decent selection for the price, fish to rice ratio is pretty good for most rolls.  The portions are not too big, so you don't have to about not being able to finish what you ordered.

**Average cost per diner: $20 per person for lunch, $30 per person for dinner (add $2 if for weekend/holiday)

Service/Convenience: 7/10

The place is easily located in Bridlewood Mall. The seating is not too crowded and we were seated fairly quickly on a Friday night. Our first round of orders arrived quickly, but subsequent rounds took a lot longer. I'm actually quite impressed with the fact that they never missed a single order, even if they did bring it slowly. 

Would go back? Sure, mainly for the scallop sashimi.  Also the place is fairly close to us, so its very convenient. 

Would recommend to friend? Yup, great place for AYCE at a decent value in Scarborough/Markham region.

Similar places: Any AYCE sushi restaurant, but as far as we know this is the only one that serves scallop sashimi

**Disclaimer: Average cost per diner constitutes the amount (per person) we eat to get full without drinks. Total cost is usually divided between 2 diners, one of whom can regularly eat 7 slices of XL pizza"}
{"text":"I used to go to their Market Village location all the time before it recently closed down :( My past few visits were not great, and service and food have definitely gone downhill. I thought I'd give this other location a try but I was further disappointed. Came here with my grandma for their ayce lunch. Menu was very limited, ordered some rolls, tempura and cooked items. The rolls were packed with ALOT of rice and the salmon nigiri did not taste fresh at all. Tempura was very greasy. The food took a long time to come, which disappointed me because everyone was just standing around talking, including the guys at the sushi bar. Only items that came fast were the desserts (pre-made). Beware of the 10% service charge. I realized most of the customers ordered from their lunch bento menu, but I don't think I will be coming back. If you like ayce , definitely check out Sushi Legend on Brimley instead. Fresher ingredients and doesn't take half an hour for seaweed salad to come out!"}
{"text":"I came here three times, twice for lunch bentos and once for ayce lunch. They have an area for AYCE only and another area for bentos only. The lunch specials were really good and the price was decent for their portions (with the exception to their sashimi bentos in comparison). The tempura was really good and all lunch specials come with miso soup. As for the AYCE, the experience was below my expectations. The sushi rice was warm. They put a lot of onions in spicy sashimi, but the onion smell is overpowering. Also, I was really disappointed that they had no kalbi during lunch hours as most japanese ayce restaurants do. A redeeming quality is that they serve chicken cartilage which is quite rare to see and it tasted great. They automatically give you the bill after you've been sitting for an hour and a half and basically tell you to finish up.  There is a 10% Service Charge added to the bill. If I come back, it'll be for the lunch bentos and not for the AYCE."}
{"text":"So far the best all you can eat place ever! The selection are great. They even have raw oysters, kobe beef..and seasonal stuff that are shipped all the way from Japan!!! It's bit on the pricer side for the special seasonal items, but worth it!   

The wait staff were really prompt, they had lots of staff, so service was super quick.
Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"If was sub-par compare to many AYCE sushi resto. Shrimp tempura was not crispy enough,  chicken wings were tasteless, beef ribs were good but not enough taste,  beef and chicken skewers'sauce would be better with beef sashimi than the skewer and the meat want tender at all.  The cut of sashimi were thin and the only good things on the menu were the chef's recommendation. I will definitely not go back..."}
{"text":"Food is great here.  It's really getting busier here than before.  Their staff was really nice and spend the time explaining. Ask for them to set a nice sushi plate.  They make a beautiful presentation.  Check out the goose liver sushi.  Taste amazing!"}
{"text":"Poor service

Bad attitude 

My friend came here many times , It's had been his go to AYCE Japanese Rest, but I guess he will not come again ."}
{"text":"Today I realized there a 2 menu for this restaurant. Ayce has less and different choice. The other menu price are average. The atmosphere is very spacious and comfortable. We had a difficulty finding it because it's at the back of the plaza and there are no sign on warden. The service was good but some watt read doesn't speak Cantonese and some do not speak English well. Overall I think it's better then the other location."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend because of her recommendation telling me this place was amazing and she came here all the time.

Parking is insane because  it's in the same area as pacific mall. From the outside, the restaurant looks just like a normal restaurant,  the entrance is small - comparable to places downtown Toronto. When you walk inside, the restaurant is decorated really well and it looks as though business is booming - we had a reservation and saw people waiting for seats.

The food isn't that great, the salmon sashimi isn't really that fresh. The beef skewers were cooked very nicely, not too chewy. Other small dishes like  chicken, shrimp tempura and calamari weren't that great. The chicken was cold and the other two were just average. Salmon roses fell apart and had a lot of rice, the sushi had a lot of rice as well. Service could've been a lot better, the servers never seem to check on you and you need to wave them down for something like you're at a baseball game trying to get a hot dog or beer from a guy 25 yards away from you.

I wouldn't recommend this place unless you're starving and in the area.

2/5"}
{"text":"Came back a year later and tried a lot more cooked foods. Pleasantly surprised and satisfied with the quality and variety. Also comes with free baked lobster (?)

I liked: 
- steamed egg with enoki
- chicken bone skewers 

Rolls are ok..

Desserts: 
- Creme brulee - perfect little size with a nice crispy coating 
- Steamed coconut milk is ok but not much coconut taste

- Fried banana - the inside is sweet and soft but again the batter is really hard and weird! Doesnt go with the banana 


Definitely one of the better AYCE places."}
{"text":"TAKE OUT REVIEW

This review only pertains to ordering take out (lunch). Our office often hosts bento lunches and this is one of the location where they order the lunch bentos.

It is easy to order from them, someone from the office just calls and provides them the order. They've gotten all the orders correct to date (we usually have over 20 orders at one time and they are always on time with their food).

Portion are great with the price you are paying for lunch - comes with a soup and salad."}
{"text":"Not very fresh fish, with poor and slow service.  For a weekend dinner rate of $26.99/adult, I'm better off going to Sushi on 7 or A&W for a few chubby chicken sandwiches"}
{"text":"We came here because we had really good experiences at the other Yamamoto ayce, but this one turned out to be a complete disappointment.
First my pop had a bug in it, which totally grossed me out.  Then the chicken soft bone skewer came extra huge with meat and skin AND the meat was under cooked.
Ramen broth was so tasteless, it might as well just be served with hot water.  Yuck!!

I should have known something wasn't quite right when at 7pm Friday night the place was 1/2 empty.

We will never come back here to dine again, and we do Japanese ayce at least once a month."}
{"text":"I don't understand all the hate, but my experience at Yamamoto was decent,  We came for dinner on weekend.  The wait for table was long; insane if you buy all the negative reviews.  When seated, the services was prompt.  We ordered a variety of items.  I clearly recalled that the sashimi was fresh, and at least on par with other good AYCE Japanese restaurants.  The sushi was loaded with rice as expected.  The maki rolls were decent.  We loved the grilled eggplant.  The grilled beef (any kind) was disappointing as the meat was dry and chewy.

The price was on par with other AYCE Japanese restaurants."}
{"text":"I like the lunch menu quite a bit, can't be beat for the bento boxes. The ramen is not very interesting or flavourful, the broth is quite bland, but he pork in it is good. 

So my take is, if you're not going for the all-you-can-eat (which I haven't tried yet), you can't go wrong with the bentos."}
{"text":"I'm giving this restaurant a 1 star review because since I've been there about more than a few times the portions are too small for the price, so I didn't get any value!, I order the bento box lunch every time and they give me some rice, tiny salmon, some wasabe, 2 dumplings, 2 small pieces of sushi, tiny shredded cabbage, tiny pickled ginger, and a tiny salad.

So, if you ask me it's a ripoff, don't waste your money!, you're better off going somewhere else!!!

NOT WORTH IT!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is decent.  About average for a Japanese buffet.  They now have a special with half lobster for dinner.  Came here for AYCE lunch $13.99 + 10% Service Charge.

They kick you out after about an hour and a half.  Arrived shortly before noon and was told last call at 1:30pm.

Note there is already 10% Service Charge added to the bill.

I really miss the Mongolian Grill buffet that used to be here."}
{"text":"UPDATE:  Yamamoto at Market Village is closed due to the end of their lease. Sad. Their Scarborough location is still opened at Warden and Finch.

It is my favorite Japanese AYCE place. Food and price are decent. Service is usually quick. They recently changed their menu. Pop is now included. A couple of their new items are definitely a must-try. Their rice paper sushi is really good! But the portion of some food is sometimes inconsistent. Love their desserts except for the green tea pudding, which taste too much like jasmine. Don't forget to ask for their VIP card if you don't have one to get 10% off (when paid with cash)."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Their Market Village used to be so good. This is our second time to this location. First time, food came out slowly. Second time, food came out EXTREMELY slowly on this family day. They were good at not packing the place but food still came out slowly. It's my first experience at a AYCE where we sat for the entire 2 hour limit and still not full. They at least did not try to rush us out. At their Market Village location (closed down already), food came out very quickly. Even the desserts (which is premade) took quite some time, they are severely under staffed. Managers on the floor seem more like bus boys, not watching the expo line for food to run which is clear to see the food was sitting in the kitchen which lead to half our orders coming 45mins late and barely warm. Kitchen staff seem to be just stabbing ticket without completing orders. Overall a very bad experience, they really dropped the ball and would not recommend coming back nor would I recommend to friends. Side note we tried putting in our orders a third time during the slower meal period time and still no improvement."}
{"text":"Update: went on a weekend for lunch. Horrible service. Extremely rude staff. They lost our order sheet and took forever for the food to come. They gave us 10% off for the delay but charged the 10% service charge on top. Not impressed. I'm used to these places charging the extra 10% but when service was that bad....they need to be a bit smarter with customer service. 


Went for their ayce dinner last night. We called last minute for a table and they were able to accommodate us. This restaurant is the same as the one at market village but smaller in size. Our group agreed this location's quality of food seems better than the Markham location. They even have special rolls that the Markham location doesn't offer. Seating is more spaced apart (if you're seated at the booths). Servers are friendly. They also serve alcohol here. Overall, we had a pleasant experience (missed a few orders but it's ayce so no biggie). I would probably chose this location over the Markham one."}
{"text":"I thought everything was standard, nothing stood out or impressed me. Food, service and general experience is a 2.5 star. With so much competition in the AYCE category, there's nothing drawing me back or left me wanting more. 

Came with my family... we ordered table full... and did 3 rounds. 

Some things that I particularly liked were 
-Black dragon troll
-Sirloin - cooked well and tasty
-Grilled fish
-large selection of food items

Some things that was not so good
-Tempura was slightly soggy, it appears they cooked it in oil that was not hot enough
- handrolls - the seaweed was not chewable. They need to upgrade the seaweed seriously
- Mandatory 20% gratuity for a party of 3? 

Everything else was fine. We left stuffed. But I've definitely had better AYCE."}
{"text":"I came here with my mom on Sunday for a late lunch around 2. The restaurant was pretty crowded but we were seated quickly. 

I got the chicken teriyaki bento box and my mom got the beef ramen. The bento box was very sad and empty looking. The waitress also forgot to make one of the changes I had asked for to change the salmon rolls to all cucumber rolls. My mom's beef ramen was better and they gave a lot of beef compared to other ramen I've tried. However, overall the food was meh and I probably wouldn't come back again."}
{"text":"I almost went to the wrong place at first. I thought this place replaced what was Watami, but it turned out to be the replacement for Mongolian Grill. Do take note of that.

The initial service was quick, as we were served drinks and given menus immediately. The food, however, took a while to come. When they came though. they came fast. Normally we have to go through 3-5 orders in order to be full, but we barely went through 2 orders before we had to call it a dinner.

Some items I recommend include the chopped ika, beef tataki, albacore tuna, philadelphia maki, mango maki, white tuna, beef ribs, and chocolate mousse pudding. Items I do not recommend include everything in the appetizer, as well as tacoyaki and green tea pudding.

Overall it was definitely worth the $23.99, and probably one of the best AYCE places in the GTA. I'm not an AYCE person, but it's definitely a place I would revisit if hunger is at an all time high.

PS: If you want pop, ask for a pitcher. It's free."}
{"text":"+.5 for service

Yamamoto actually used to be a decent AYCE Japanese buffet back when it was at Market Village. However since the move to Bridlewood Mall, it's gone downhill.

Went here for Christmas Eve with a party of 5. Thankfully we reserved beforehand and had a table ready, as it was incredibly busy despite the snowstorm outside. 

We ordered several items including takoyaki, miso soup, enoki beef roll, sashimi plate, and many of their weekend seared sushi specials. Unfortunately, aside from the weekend seared sushi specials, everything else ranged from average to really bad. For instance, the miso soup was cold when served. The enoki beef roll had enoki mushrooms that probably weren't even a millimetre in diameter. The takoyaki seemed to have been fried, rather than cooked using that special pan. There were other issues including missing orders and receiving food that we never ordered in the first place.

I will, however, give credit where it's due. This is one of the few AYCE places that has the sushi/roll to rice ratio correct. The sushi isn't served with huge chunks of rice with the thinnest slice of fish possible.

Service was also good, at least the servers apologized for some of the food taking a while to come. However the ship has sailed with this AYCE place, and there are now numerous others in the Scarborough/Markham area that are superior to this place."}
{"text":"Was disappointed about the maki rolls, ordered almost every single maki roll on the menu but none of them seemed good. The only thing that I liked was the sashimi which was fresh but I guess you can get the same elsewhere. If you want to get the lobster make sure you call in for reservation first! Went on a Sunday and the bill was about $29 per person including tax and tips."}
{"text":"I type as I wait for our table. It's actually pretty ridiculous.  When we called they said 30 min wait. Not so bad. My kids chose sushi and super hungry and 30 min wasn't so bad. It's now an hr and we still don't have a table. We would have left if not the fact my daughter fell asleep and to pack her back in the car was going to be such a hassle. I have been to other busy busy busy AYCE sushi places much smaller than this with line ups longer than this and never had to wait this freaking long. The hostess is so unfriendly. No seating at waiting area, dead plants, hand written notes all over ... It's seems all just out of place. Uggs need to be banned at at any work place especially as a hostess at a restaurant.

Now the review after we finally got seated. An hour later.  The food came pretty fast. They forgot a few of our items however. Then I witnessed the most horrific thing ever !! A waitress stopped in front of our table and looked confused. She was holding a tray full of drinks (pop) she stopped and looked at the receipt and I guess she couldn't read it properly so she got closer to the tray and her long bangs dipped into at least three of the glasses !!!! And she continued to serve the drinks!!! Yikes !!! I hope she had a bath !!!!!"}
{"text":"Been here about 5 times with friends and it's decent. Very roomy and the prices for all you can eat is the same as many others. However, bento boxes lunch specials (after 11:00am) is pretty good portion for its' price! I got the beef bento box, they gave so much beef! I would not recommend the spicy soup noodle that is offered in all you can eat... It's just water and hot sauce. Spicy salmon sushi is pretty good too!"}
{"text":"Foods are good but service is terrible. Never got a \" you're welcome\" from the waiter as many times as i said \"thank you\" every time my foods are brought to the table. Also, they have the promotion about getting free half lobster but the waiter said i have to pay using cash to get that offer. It wasn't stated on the promo board so i was still able to pay with my credit card. They really do give you a hard time if you're paying with credit card. Btw, i wasn't offered the free lobster promo until I've asked my waiter about it. Not a very friendly place to dine but the foods are still ok. The sushi and the dessert are the best. I love my steam coconut milk dessert."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with my parents and we opted for the bento boxes. My mom and I got sushi which was good and my dad got a fried pork with curry sauce. The curry sauce was very flavourful but salty. The next time I visit this restaurant, I would definitely want to go for the AYCE because I didn't feel satisfied without my usual rolls and desserts! Just a note that the lunch bento box specials come with miso soup but no desserts. Also note that they include tips in their billing so don't over tip!"}
{"text":"Food wise, it's probably one of the better Japanese AYCE places. But their service just doesn't match their quality in food. 

My Bf and I went on a Saturday night, granted it was half. But we had to wait a good 15 minutes for anyone to greet us - even though a few servers saw us while they were walking by. When we sat down the male servers gave us tea and just walked off, which would of been fine if we didn't want drinks. But my bf and I wanted some drinks so we had to wait for another 10 minutes to flag down a server to order our drinks and put in our first order. 

Our first round came relatively fast and the quality is pretty good. Since its an AYCE I was impressed with the freshness and the rolls weren't falling apart. Tempura was crispy, fish was grilled perfectly. Everything we ordered were good. 

When we tried to put in our second order it took another 15 minutes and they didn't clear off our tables either. He just walked off and never came back. By now my bf was annoyed and he had to wave his arms in the air to flag down a server to clean off our tables. While he was cleaning the table he was slamming the plates around as if he's annoyed at us. What the heck.....? So my bf asked to speak to the manager, the same server just said he's not here tonight and walks off.  

Honestly when I go out to eat I don't expect to have this type of attitude. No matter how good the food is, if the service is horrible I will never recommend this place to anyone. 

Another thing I'm peeved about is they have an automatic 10% service charge already added to the bill. This only promotes mediocrity in service because the servers don't need to work for their money."}
{"text":"This place deserves the 5 stars. Not everything is great, but they have way too many great items to not be a 5 star in the category of ayce sushi. Nice decor and atmosphere, good privacy with the layout. Quick service, mostly accurate. Would come back in a heartbeat while the lobster special is still going on. On a weeknight, 24.99 per person for dinner. 

1. Free half lobster when in season - cannot emphasize how good of a deal this was - and it was so delicious. Lots of tomalley mixed in with mayo.. genius! I even asked if I could buy another serving but that would have been costly ($10 per half serving) 
2. Many unique items done very well:
-seafood salad sushi (a combination of crab salad, octopus bits and salmon mixed in with mayo) 
-baked avocado with SALMON (changed the texture of the dish compared to other places doing it with bits of other seafood.. and the serving is smaller so much easier to handle and re-order if need be)
-great soups, loved the fish soup which was different, it had a very strong cilantro(?) taste.. very refreshing
-cappucino flavoured ice cream, kind of sorbety in texture, all their desserts were not super sweet which was great
3. Other stuff done well:
-octopus was cut nice and thick, texture was great and the taste of the lemon slices seeped through into the meat nicely
-scallop sashimi is available.. nuff said
-mango pudding, although no real mango chunk, was very good 
-creme brulee was light 
-agedashi tofu light in texture and the fry was thin 
-baked butter mushrooms.. yummm
-chicken wings nice crisp on outside and tender on the inside
-if you like chicken cartilege, the grilled chicken bone is a must order

Stuff NOT done well/would NOT recommend:
-beef tataki not sliced thin enough and overdone
-sirloin steak cubes tough
-samna fish overcooked (pieces of flesh did not break apart easily)
-muscles in special house sauce (sauce was a tobasco mixture.. didn't enjoy this) 
-eel handroll made with canned eel (taste is very distinct if youve had canned eel before.. but they used fresh eel for the caterpillar roll)"}
{"text":"First post and thought it should be here! Went here for dinner on Saturday night. Compared to NY places, this is a pretty good place to eat. Lots of fresh sashimi to choose from and dont skimp on the slices..... in NY, a lot of the times, when you ask for 15 pieces of salmon they give you 10... here, they're more exact so PROPS to you on that.

Decor was a plus... had an asian oriental feel to it. added nicely

Servers were 8/10 attentive. Lobsters special is a big plus! My friends didnt even get it because they were too full after all the other food to eat more. I would suggest eating it first so you dont waste lobster if youre a big fan like I am! i am very happy about this place as the price for me in a group of 6 was only about $25 USD dollars. 

The only thing i would be wary about it ordering only as much as you can finish. we realized a lot of the dishes came in doubles after because they were from our last order so we ending wasting about two rolls. I felt bad wasting the food even though theres no surcharge for wasted food and the other customers didnt care too much. 

Deserts in small quantities like they way they gave us was also really smart and good. LOVED their coconut milk pudding! 

Would def come back next time im back in CA!"}
{"text":"Food was decent, not amazing. Their black dragon maki, salmon sashimi, and scallop sashimi were really good.

The restaurant looked very upscale and it was pretty clean, besides the lipstick mark on my friend's teacup. The service was horrible, the servers pretty much ignored us and it was difficult to get their attention.

It's pretty pricy for the quality of food and service you get and I definitely won't be returning."}
{"text":"I don't even want to give ONE star. Worst Jap AYCE in town. Cheap on sashimi if u write 10 pieces on ur order sheet ended up u get 5 pieces, we had to place the third round to get enough raw fish! Guess what the waitress tried to kick us out before the 4th round within 2hrs of eating. If u have to give a try, don't order ton-yum soup they only add thai paste/msg/a lot of salt/tobasco! At the end we waited another 30mins for dessert just because we already paid and they just wanted to make us leave!!"}
{"text":"Sashimi is ok, but not impressive, sushi and handroll not bad, BBQ is good, service is not very fast, overall is ok, can have a try, but will not be my first choice."}
{"text":"Honestly one of the best ayce that I've had in a long time. Been coming here everytime I crave sushi and boy is it worth it. First off, the salmon nachos are AMAZING. A little bit spicey, bite sized and jam packed with loads of flavour. The tempura shrimp is also delicious with a very fluffy tempura batter. Last but not least, the service there is absolutely amazing. Everyone greets you as a friend rather then a stranger.
All in all, I would definitely recommend this to whoever wants to try a nice ayce."}
{"text":"Been here a few times for AYCE. Always have a good time here. The place doesn't get filled up even on weekends, so you'll often get seated right away even without a reservation. 

Sashimi are always freshly served. Their kitchen food is also delicious (especially love the tempura!) They have the torched sushi which I absolutely adore!! 

Don't forget to save room for desserts because their creme brûlée is to die for! I've seen people had 8-10 of them for dessert. You know it's great when your picky dessert friend also approves it."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. I feel like it's a little over priced during the weekends. Since I don't eat raw I couldn't try the raw Sushi's anyways.. the rest of the food taste pretty decent. If you come during weekdays it's good value I think.. I also like their lunch special which is only $8 around that will fill me up pretty well for a quick and decent lunch"}
{"text":"Just came from this place..service was good. More importantly the food was good too. The sashimi was definitely fresh,  cut the right way the kind that actually melts in your mouth and slides down ur throat. Ome of the places iv been too tjat actually served good quality seafood. The hokkigai ,  grilled squid, baked spicy mussel and scallop sashimi is a must try. The rolls are just so-so. The chawamushi (excuse the spelling) is good too. And the enoki beef. Good food and company equals great dinner!"}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best sushi AYCE (All you can eat) places I've been to in town. The feel of it is almost like Tenichi on Mccowan and Sheppard. 

Price-wise : it was not pricey for what you get. ~$21 per person. 

I went there with my boyfriend and the waiter was super friendly. He kept checking on us every 5-10 minutes to make sure we are still doing okay on food. The waiters share responsibilities so it was really easy to go and get someone to take our order. 

The sashimi was amazing. The fish were fresh and so was the surf clam (hokkigai). A really good soup to start with is the fish soup and it was definitely an impressive starter. I loved the spicy salmon and tuna handrolls beceause there were just enough salmon and tuna in each of them. Some places give you lots of rice in the handroll, which you don't want since you want to fill it with all the fish and good foods that you can. 

My favorite item was the mango yogurt dessert and the green tea pudding. Most amazing delicious desserts I've tasted. Not too sweet yet flavorful. I'd definitely recommend anyone to come and try it!"}
{"text":"Saw the many great reviews and was extremely excited to give this place a try.

Restaurant is fairly big, as it used to be a Mongolian Grill, and the current restaurant uses that large cooker to make their cooked food.

Service is prompt, and food came very fast, only had about a 5 minute wait after we placed the order. 
But we went to eat late lunch at about 3PM, though they charge it as \"All Day Dinner\".

Sashimi was not as fresh as I imagined it would be, and I was extremely disappointed with their noodle in soup.  My boyfriend and I ordered one beef udon and another \"spicy\" beef udon.  Even by the look of it, we were a little surprised when it arrived. After we tasted it?  
It was basically two same bowls, except the spicy bowl was added with siracha & tobasco in the soup.
DEFINATELY not what I was expecting. The beef with the noodles were so dry and chewy.

We ordered Salmon roses, my favorite, and they arrived fairly large. Salmon roses are usually cut with thin slices of salmon but the size that they cut was the same size as you would get on a sashimi cut.

Sashimi Scallops were diced up (also not what I expected) especially after eating at Dragon Legend before.

Their desserts...
We tried their mousse, pudding, yogurts, ice cream, and steamed coconut milk.
Awkward enough.. they put jelly on the bottom of steamed milk (weird)
Mousse and pudding tasted watered down
Ice cream didn't even taste that great either.

The only plates I enjoyed here were the enoki mushrooms with rolled beef & their grilled eggplant.
Everything else was average or below average.

Definately not coming back here.. not after paying over $60 for 2 people eating a late lunch for AYCE with such food quality. 

And may I also mention that they REALLY need to clean and freshen up their washrooms, extremely unhygienic for a restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm actually pretty disappointed in this place.  My friend's assured me it was one of the \"better AYCE\" restaurants.  How?!

The restaurant itself was very empty coming in on a Saturday night, that should've been warning sign #1.

The food came quickly but in a spotty manner as some dishes actually never showed up at the table.  The sashimi felt somewhat warm even though it was laying on a bed of ice when it arrived to the table.
The menu was okay, with sweet shrimp and scallop sashimi.  (These were one of the the spotty dishes)

The service was decent until the very end when the girl who was bringing creme brulee mumbled something to herself then literally THREW the two bowls onto the table. The spoon actually bounced out of one and onto the floor, she looked at it then casually sauntered off.  Like, are you okay???

The quality of the food wasn't very high and the service was a hit or miss.  I rather pay a little more and eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"The good: lunch specials offer a variety of bento boxes for sashimi and teriyaki. The teriyaki box was decent and came with a miso soup. 

The bad: the bento boxes are sad...I was sad looking at it. The slices of salmon I had were so thinly sliced, 2 slices would've made 1. The rest of the food were very small portions for a decent size box - at least get a smaller box! I was pretty disappointed and would not go back. The price was almost $10 for a tiny box."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Good Friday and it was packed. Food was meh. Sushi was overloaded with rice, way too much batter on the calamari, and short ribs were chewy. Servers would bring orders to the wrong table and some orders would take ridiculously long to come out. Just your typical Chinese AYCE Sushi."}
{"text":"I had dinner here once again last night with my bf, and i decided i had to give yamamoto one star up giving them 5 stars. 

Never a disappointment when i eat here. 

Fresh food, and best creme brules."}
{"text":"pretty standard ayce sushi place.

something interesting that i never had before here was scallop sashimi. it didn't really taste like anything, but had a strange texture to it.
everything else, like i said, was pretty standard.

the service wasn't bad at all compared to what u would normally expect from an ayce sushi restaurant.

one thing that i really liked was the cappucino ice cream. i had 2 bowls of that. delicious.

after taxes and 10% service charge we each paid $32."}
{"text":"As a bi-annual AYCE diner (once every 2 years, no joke), I had no idea buffet prices have increased 50%. So fault me for rolling my eyes and not being used to the fact that weeknight buffets for good Jap food is now $30. Trying AYCE as a group of 6 is probably much better than going as a table for 2.  

I really enjoyed the food, there was a good selection of raw (mackerel, scallop, salmon, octopus, beef tataki, roe) and cooked (baby kalbi, warm avocado & salmon salad, tempura, udon, unagi, squid, chicken katsu) dishes, and lots of roll varieties. Everybody was also excited by the half lobster per person.

I usually cannot judge desserts. If it contains sugar, I'm all for it.

Only wish that 1st drink was free and not additional $. But tea was complimentary.

Let's hope the quality is maintained a little while longer before it is supplanted by yet another AYCE in Markham.  See you in 2 years! :P"}
{"text":"2.5 Star

Yamamoto Japanese Cuisine is definitely under staff in the kitchen. Even with the restaurant not even 1/5 full to it's capacity. The sushi chefs were so overwhelmed and food took forever to arrive. 

We ordered the following to share

App:
Chilled Tofu - Bad
Curry Fish Ball - Bad
Curry Cuttle Fish (Thai Style) - Bad
Shrimp Tempura - A OK

Sushi & Maki: 
Salmon Sushi - OK
Spicy Salmon Sushi -OK
Tobiko Sushi - A OK
Chopped Ika - A OK
Unagi Hand Roll - A OK
Spicy Salmon Hand Roll
Spicy Tuna Maki - Nasty! The sauce tasted funny and roll itself have strange texture
Unagi Maki

Cooked Food:
Thai Beef Brisket with Rice - Sad looking mess
Chicken Teriyaki - Dry like a cardboard
Unagi Rice - 2 paper thin eel, a little sad
Grilled Sarma Fish - Excellent
Grilled Salmon Head - Excellent
Grilled Saba - Excellent
Grilled Chicken Skewer - Funny tasting sauce 
Agedashi Tofu - Excellent freshly deep fried 
Teppanyaki Sirloin Steak - Really tender A- OK
Pan Fried Undon - So gluey and the sauce has this overwhelming sweetness to it
Spicy Beef Ramen - OK
Seafood Udon - OK

Dessert:
Green Tea Ice Cream - standard, but they didn't clean the ice cream scoop after they scoop up strawberry ice cream

Lunch Special $13.99 + 10% Service Charge is not bad for AYCE. But just make sure you have 2 hours for lunch and submit your order sheet in ASAP. Some of the cook food are a miss.. but the grilled fish items are wonderful if you are a fish person.

I can't imagine if the restaurant is at its full capacity because there is no way the kitchen will able to handle all these hungry people. 

Will I be back? Maybe..."}
{"text":"Its an exciting place to visit and the restaurant design is just wow!  Trendy open concept, with the view of the big kitchen from anywhere in the room, oriental yet earthly. A good venue with friends or families with small kids, or for just chillin' after a massive shopping spree at Pacific Mall just steps away.  

We went here for lunch and enjoyed the items on the menu which were all too familiar to us.  The food is good and tasty yet verging on mediocrity.  Its like being stuffed yet unsatisfied.

The need for improvement on the quality may have been be too noticeable for me, e.g. the rice seemed regular grains and not prepared well, and sluggish in the rolls; the mayonnaise/dressing was not whipped well enough for that subtle & delectable run of flavour; the size of the rolls seemed smaller to what I'm used to, etc.  Even the chef's top recommendations were not impressive. 

It was a disappointment that many items on our order list were not served at all.  And I thought that the waiters needed a more efficient method of monitoring it.  They were nice and friendly but somewhere in the workflow is a significant oversight.

Its an A-OK place for me with some optimism that the food will be better in a few months since the entire room made me think that they are serious about their business.  In the meantime, I'm gonna swing by my fave (impressive food) Japanese AYCE places.  ;)"}
{"text":"We really like this place for take-out platters. They have excellent pricing for take-out platters for normal tasting rolls and sushi. I've always had a really good experience with the service."}
{"text":"Seafood was not very good. Tasted like it had been sitting in the fridge for days. Cooked food terribly inconsistent. Some was over seasoned, some had no seasoning. Terribly slow service and I don't think they got one order right the whole night. Stay away from anything beef. Unless you like chewing."}
{"text":"It's no secret that I'm not a big fan of all you can eat Japanese food. But recently, the owner of Watami (which I frequent) opened a new Japanese restaurant in Market Village, so I figured I should give it a try. Yamamoto actually replaced Mongolian Grill, and the large and spacious layout still seemed a little odd to me for a Japanese restaurant. For dinner, the price is $21.99 for Monday to Thursday, and $23.99 for Friday to Sunday (for adults). Seniors have a $2 discount, and children under 10 are charged $11.99 all seven days of the week. 

What I liked about Yamamoto is that you can practically order anything by individual pieces, so when you ask for 1 order of shrimp tampura, they'll give you exactly 1 piece! Because of the small portions, we were able to try a lot of dishes between 3 people.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the sushi here. The hand rolls were well-executed and the salmon sashimi was particularly excellent.There were hits and misses with the grilled food. The sirloin steak cubes were overcooked, although I did enjoy the baked butter mushrooms very much. There wasn't a huge selection of sushi rolls, but the one we chose - tiger roll(spider roll with mango and avocado)- was pretty good. I was pretty pleased with the dessert selection, which features the likes of crème brûlée, mango parfait, tiramisu, green tea pudding and five different flavours of ice cream. 

Being a new restaurant, the place still needs to work out some of its kinks in operations. For instance, a third of our first order never arrived (although the server that followed up with this error was very diligent about it). All in all, I thought that the food here was decent for AYCE standards, and there were certainly a lot of variety. That said, I still much prefer à la carte style."}
{"text":"Decent AYCE sushi.  The space is massive and plain located in the parking lot next to the Pacfic Mall.  The quality of the fish is good and the price is fair. OK but I wouldn't seek it out."}
{"text":"If you are ever in the mood for salmon, this is a decent place to fulfil your craving!  I discovered the restaurant in the mall, and was pleasantly surprised that it would even exist in this mall.  Lots of pictures show AYCE items.  There was also a menu on display showing various bento box specials.  I have always liked bento boxes, so i decided to have lunch there.
The decor was ok.  Leaning more toward tacky than elegance.
The food though.... when i looked at the bento specials, i was absolutely excited over the salmon bento box (approx $10).   So i ordered it and when it arrived, i was amused at how big the bento box was in term of size,  which made the contents inside looked sparse when it really was not the case.  Every piece of salmon was delicious and i am definitely going back there again for sure.  The only thing that i would change about this experience is the soy sauce.... too salty."}
{"text":"Just noticed this place on the way to the only Taco Bell in my area inside Bridlewood Mall. Decided to try this out instead of tacos for an afternoon snack just to be different.

Considering we arrived just around 4:30 pm, it was nice of them to let us avail of their lunch specials rather than their all you can eat option. 

So we decided to go with their chashew ramen since we wanted something simple and cheap like a taco. 

One good thing about the ramen is that they are generous with the chashew portions and the broth had the slight thickness of a pork bone soup.  However that's about the only good things I can say about it. 

The ramen noodles tastes a little eggy and didn't really taste right even for an eggy noodle. 

The seaweeds they used are not nori. They were the rehydrated seaweeds. So it feels out of place. 

The broth is like water and almost no flavour. After drinking it my tongue started to feel numb so I guess it has some MSG. 

Finally the egg tastes like the tea egg that you get at Taiwanese shops. But does not match the rest of the ramen. 

So overall I won't recommend this place for Ramen. Niwatei which is nearby is much better."}
{"text":"Okay,  this review is a tad bias. 

I live in the general area (5 mins walk)  so it is very convenient.  I only recommend to come here during lunch because you will be getting basically the same menu items as you would for dinner.  (14.99 Lunch thru Mon-Fri compared to 24.99 on dinner).  The Sushi is good it comes quick and it taste fresh.  Huge shout outs to their grill items.  Some of them are amazing!  Food comes out quick. 

The BIGGEST compliant I have is their service. Their servers are very rude.  One time I can in for takeout and they thought I was here for AYCE. So the server brushed me off.  Also another time they poor me hot water when I asked for cold (who orders hot water lmfao).  They just don't feel as friendly as compared to other places.  

If you disregard the service I would give it 5 stars. I like this place.  Good food for a good price"}
{"text":"4 stars. I've been to Yamamoto many times including à la carte & AYCE lunch and the AYCE dinner. For the best value for food, I would come here for the à la carte lunch. The bentos are reasonably priced with decent portions and quality. The price for the AYCE is definitely competitive with other places.

The most positive thing about this restaurant is that they don't (or rarely) mess up orders. I have been to too many places where they do and it's a struggle to even get the food you ordered. 

Most items come promptly even when the place is packed. There is a good number of waiters around so you can usually catch one of their attention quickly. The sushi and especially the tempura comes late often but they take longer to make/prepare.

I have not tried the fish you have to pay extra for on the special menu. 

I think their tempura is below average (it's not dry enough) so take caution in ordering a lot. The sushi is above average quality in comparison with other AYCE restaurants so that is a huge plus. The kalbi is much better than the sirloin steak every time I tried them. I actually like how small most of the portions were (specifically the noodles). You can try a variety of food without getting too full. The variety of food isn't the greatest but it is good enough that you won't feel ripped off. The selection of desserts is loved by many. They come in a small glass, so again, you can try a variety without getting full. 

What brings the rating down for me is the overall quality of food. Compared to other Japanese AYCE, this place is fantastic! But it's only so because the competition is so lacking. While I do love the food here, I can only find myself going back maybe once a month.

Overall a reliable pick for a dinner out. Make sure you book a table on weekends as it can get full."}
{"text":"We came for the AYCE with my family and they do have a lot of options for AYCE. As far as quality, it is soso but they do have a good variety of Japanese, Chinese food. The space is limited but enough for a big family. The sushi is ok as good as most AYCE sushi locations, and the pricing is average. The service was not bad and ambience is also average, but not too loud. We did come here once for lunch specials and that was also average but the lunch deal is a good deal for sushi, and seaweed salad deal for under $10."}
