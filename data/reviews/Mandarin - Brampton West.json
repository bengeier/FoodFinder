{"text":"Our family of 5 went there last week for the first time.  We usually go to Biscayne or Matheson.  It definitely felt smaller and the decor was not the bright, light Mandarin type.  The food was good as usual but the choices were not as good.  The kids liked the cotton candy machine and sushi the best.  We going for father's day but not at this location until it improves."}
{"text":"Great food selection and service at this location! The servers were always on point when it came to cleaning the table or bringing water."}
{"text":"I've always come to Mandarin (whether this one, or other locations) not out of my choosing. To state the obvious: this is Westernized Chinese food 101. I won't be too proud to admit that I can find some guilty pleasure in some of it (though my bloated-ness and fatigue after eating is not pleasurable). That said, why would you ever want to pay over $20 for food no better than Manchu Wok at a food court near you? I'm not even saying it to be cruel: the food is directly on par with Manchu Wok. Won't the chow mein or fried rice with 3 sides at $8.99 suffice for people? And some of the 'unique' things they offer over Manchu Wok are either forgettable (dessert) or plain nasty (sushi).
I'll give them credit for running a tight ship and always having good service. But I won't lie to say that I cringe anytime I hear 'x' family member wants their birthday dinner there, and I can basically throw away my valued (and limited) money."}
{"text":"Great food and app been better customer service. I will recommend this place to large groups and families."}
{"text":"Been to several ayce Chinese restaurants all over North America and this place impressed me. We all know ayce isn't the best place to get quality dining, but this place is actually legit! 

Service was great. 

Food was fresh (thank goodness) and DELICIOUS. Its not like other ayce places where the food is terrible. My favourite was the garlic pepper chicken. 

The dessert was great too. Ice cream was actually creamy and not just frozen water like at other buffets. 

Restrooms were super clean. 

Definitely would come back here. A+++"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of buffets and this one is no different than any other Mandarin. In fact it's way smaller than any other one I've been to with a lot less choices.

The ONLY thing that is different about this one that I've noticed, is at the sushi counter, they had sashimi. It was fresh and really tasty. I had a few plates of that. Other than that, it's the usual.

I have to say that the service here was really great. The servers were attentive, always coming to remove plates, and even offered to take photos of my boyfriends niece as we sung her happy birthday.  I would go back for the service, but not the food (except maybe the sashimi!)"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery at 5:50 on a Saturday afternoon. Over the phone, we were told it would be a 60-90 minute delivery time. Pretty disappointing given that Brampton West is about a 5-10 minute drive from our house. After 90 minutes I tried calling the restaurant for an update on our food... I tried over 25 times (and have the phone records to prove it!), and every time the phone line was busy. 

Our credit card was charged at around 7:40, which we know as my husband has configured text message alerts when his card is charged.

At 8:15, on call number 32, I finally got ahold of someone at the restaurant, who apologized stating they had a new driver and that he should be there any minute. I asked if the food was still fresh or if it had been sitting since our card was charged and was told it would be fresh and that the restaurant would process a 50% refund on our dinner for the inconvenience.

The food arrived at 8:35. The portions were actually smaller than I expected, and so-so. Surprisingly the entrees didn't come with rice. The sushi was dreadful. I paid half price, but it was honestly overpriced even at that given the portion size and the quality of the food.

Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Confession time : Ok so I don't really like buffets. 

Why did I end up here you ask? My fiance's dad loves them and they only time we end up going is on his birthday and Fathers Day. I just find I eat too much and don't ever find anything overly tasty.

When we visited they had their crab leg event on. I tried a couple of legs and they were a-ok. Was kind of intense to see people hovering and snatching around the trays as the crab was refilled... just not my scene.

Random observation : the tables here are super small. Or at least the one we were seated at. We were a party of 6 but honestly it felt like we were at a 4 people sized table - so squished!

Restaurant was pretty clean and the food was displayed in almost all instances in a very attractive way. Highlight for me was probably the dessert table. Loved seeing a 5 year old girl top her pea sized dollop of ice cream with literally 14 scoops of sprinkles - get it girl!

Will probably return again someday (against my will)."}
{"text":"We usually love this location. We have gone here at least once a month since they opened 4 years ago. Today, however, was not good. There is totally new wait staff, who made me feel that I had to rush to finish my meal. They seemed to hover around the tables. The food was also cold. 
 However, I must say, when we spoke to the Assistant Manager, Liana, she was so apologetic and felt so bad, because she recognized us, she offered to comp the meal. Hubby said no, and paid the bill, however with no tip. As we were leaving, she presented me with a stuffed Panda. 
 I am sure every restaurant has a bad day."}
{"text":"Great experience paired with a great meal. All you can eat with great mixture of food. Service was top notch. Irene was excellent and did a wonderful job of taking care of us."}
{"text":"AYCE buffets are tailored made for women and men with a large appetite. However, this is a tell-tale sign that seldom fortunes of great food. Mandarin is your typical buffet that serves average Asian-Fusion cuisine. During my recent venture, I visited on a cold, afternoon with my friends.

Entering the front doors, two waitresses greeted us. Quickly seated at our table, my friends and me raced towards the buffet line, stomachs growling for food.

The food lacks quality and has fewer variety of food. Most food items are bland and taste unfresh. However, sashimi at the sushi counter is served exclusively (out of all Mandarin locations I visited) at this location. 

The d√©cor is modern and feels welcoming, which has a different look to other Mandarins. The service is below average. The waiter was not attentive and unprofessional when serving. During my lastest visit, the waiter frowned upon my actions for photographing for my Yelp review.

Mandarin is a disappointment compared to the other locations. I do not recommend this to anyone.
Update Jan 24: Edited grammatical errors, includes my lastest visit and more detail."}
{"text":"Came in pretty late. Staff said the kitchen closes at 9:30. We arrived at 8:30. We usually eat pretty fast, but we asked the host if they will be putting away food soon or there will still be good variety. She replied that they still have food and a lot of selection since it was chinese new year. The restaurant was very nice, a little too stuffy and warm for my liking, but wasn't unbearable. Food selection was not that great. Food looked like they were sitting there the whole day. The taste and quality wasn't that great neither. Every bite felt like it was lacking something. We also had to wait pretty long and had to ask twice for some water. At 9:20, they were putting away all the dessert, while I was going to grab some. Staff didn't even bother asking me if I wanted to have any, they literally  grab it out of my reach and quickly put it away or even throw it right in the garbage so I won't get the chance to ask for it. I know we came late, but we specifically asked at what time they were closing the kitchen. If we had known they were ready to kick everyone out, we wouldn't have stayed and mostly, they shouldn't have take us in to make a quick buck. Mandarin, NO NO NO"}
{"text":"We called at 5:30 pm and asked them if we needed to make reservations for 6:45 pm. We were told that they was no need. When we arrived at 6:45, they told us to wait 30 min. Why didn't  they set up a reservation in the first place.  

Once in the buffet, we did get good service."}
{"text":"Went here with a group to have dinner as 1 of our friends was visiting from out of town.

Staff was very friendly and attentive.  Constantly filling our drinks, getting our empty plates and getting us napkins.  If they apot 1 of us having crab legs on our plate... they would bring the tool to crack the shell.

Parking can be a bit of a pain during busy times... linch and dinners.

Noce find... as the one on 410 and Steeles lacks in some good staff."}
