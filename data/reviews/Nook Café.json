{"text":"Initially, we wanted to eat at the restaurant upstairs but there was an hour wait so we settled with The Nook. Since it looked like your typical cafe off of a mall food court, I was a little hesitant at first. I ordered Rise and Shine crepes ( Ham, eggs & cheese) with a large iced cold brewed coffee. My crepes was surprisingly good and filling, I thought my coffee turned out perfect too! Usually when I ordered iced coffee with creamer and sweetener, it's either overwhelmingly sweet or drowned with so much creamer, it looked like I'm drinking milk instead. 

My coffee was a little over $7, I think it was more than my food lol It is a little pricey BUT it's Vegas!"}
{"text":"The Cuban was so good at the Nook.
My wife and I both ordered Cuban sandwiches. From time of order, to receiving the sandwiches, service was friendly and helpful. Sandwich was served hot, crunchy, and full of flavor. We both enjoyed the sandwich very much and would return for it again."}
{"text":"Stopped by this little gem on Tuesday for a quick lunch and this morning for breakfast and might I say it was one of the best lunches and breakfasts  I've ever had . THE Nook Cafe not to be confused with the Nook Express was amazing from their quick and easy menus to their made fresh ingredients . For lunch I had the BLTA on a Multigrain bread it was perfect the bacon was on point as well as the avocado . For breakfast I had a quick 2 eggs over easy breakfast served with bacon and two DELICIOUS HASH BROWN TRIANGLES MMMMM MMMM these by far are the best hash browns I've had in my entire life . My boyfriend had the Cuban sandwich for lunch and mentioned it was delicious similar to portos  if you've had them you know how delicious they are for breakfast he had the chorizo burrito served on a red tortilla. I stole a bite of his breakfast and I'll add it tasted like a genuine burrito . I would definitely  recommend this little cafe and my visits to the linq will definitely have a Nook detour"}
{"text":"Service was terrible- cashier was rude. She was so rude that I ended up canceling my order because I did not want to deal with attitude. Turns out, she did not even issue full refund and I was charged for an item I did not receive."}
{"text":"Food extremely fresh (made to order) and delicious. Very reasonable price (make your own salad with 6 toppings for $10, 2 slices of pizza for $5.5, breakfast for $7). Friendly staff and good service."}
{"text":"Not very good anymore and pricy 
."}
{"text":"Our family stayed at the Linq and we were pleasantly surprised to find this gem tucked away in a quiet corner, conveniently near the room elevators. Our first night at the hotel we walked around outside, looking for a late dinner/snack and ended up here. Great pizza, sodas, and espresso for my hip teen. The food was good, prices good, nice seating area. What really makes the Nook a find is the excellent customer service. Andra went above and beyond to talk to us, offer suggestions, and remembered us the whole time were were there. The rest of the staff, too, was friendly and efficient. We went back many times for pastries, desserts, pizzas and more during our stay. Definitely recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"Terrible experience at the Nook. Went there for breakfast. Ordered two eggs over easy, bacon, and tomato slices instead of the hash brown. When my order was called, they didn't have tomato slices on the plate, I asked, and the employee quickly added some, asking me if I wanted two slices or one! The eggs looked good, but upon sinking my fork into the eggs, I quickly found that they were undercooked, and well, pretty much raw. The bacon was great and the only positive thing about the meal. I also ordered a coffee. I'm not a picky coffee drinker at all, but that coffee was absolutely terrible. I wouldn't recommend the Nook at all, at least for breakfast."}
{"text":"If you're tired of the greasy and expensive midnight bites around Las Vegas Ave., or seeking for easy choice as a breakfast or light lunch, just come and try it. It brings different atmosphere for this area. Their cheese pizza is one of the best that I have ever had so far!"}
{"text":"5stars!! Awesome pizza, salads. Sandwiches, pastries etc. stopped in early morning for a mocha and pastry and stopped in late night for a pizza slice and a soda. The food is of high quality and all the employees are cheerful. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Nice food for reasonable casino prices. I had the bacon egg and cheese crossaint. It was made fresh and my entire meal was under 10 dollars. The cashier was also very nice."}
{"text":"When u stay in The Linq, this place is a quick go to for the most needed items. Coffee, Teas, Breakfast-Dinner foods & quicks drinks or snacks. 

Came for chai tea latte, late night dinner, energy drinks and more goodies. Service is your usual coffee/food shop  busy but they get you out pretty quickly. And if you're waiting on items, just people watch the hotel walk-thru area to pass the time."}
{"text":"This place is pretty solid it is new and still working out some kinks (preps knowing all the ingredients in sandwiches without having to refer to menu) but it is good for a good price on the strip. As others mentioned the make your own salads are a good healthy option and the pizza was very tasty. 

Don't get confused as there is a nook coffee bar around the corner food is on at the restaurant in the back it is pretty quick service."}
{"text":"It is like being at the airport. Crowded, expensive, noisy, and rude. Don't eat here. There are plenty of other places to choose from."}
{"text":"Remember the \"and then\" scene in Dude Where's My Car with the Asian drive-thru lady? The service here makes her look like the employee of the month.

Everyone I encountered was polite but clueless. Cashier line moved slowly and the ordering process somehow took five minutes per person. AND THEN, my transaction amount didn't match menu pricing, no explanation given. AND THEN, I waited for salad to be made to order, only for them to make the wrong one. I corrected them a few times, showing on my receipt that I ordered the 7 Layer Chicken, but employee assured me she was making my order correctly... AND THEN she continued double checking the menu board and adding ingredients for the Southwest Salad.

AND THEN my order was packed with a flimsy lid that fell off and scattered my food all over the bag. After half an hour waiting, I was running late so I just took the wrong order. AND THEN, when I finally got to eat it, I found my order to be one of the more unappealing salads I've ever ordered, and portion was closer to a side salad than a meal. I have no idea how this place stays open."}
{"text":"Went for lunch at 10am. With a long line out the door, the cashier, Rochelle, was still very patient and friendly when she had to explain to me that all menu items were pre-made and couldn't be customized. Then she explained how to special order an item exactly how I wanted it, and come to find out, it wasn't any more expensive than the menu item, which was a pleasant surprise! The 2 folks prepping and plating the food and calling out names were more friendly than I expected, considering the high volume and fast pace. A couple of customers (including me) had an item missed or incorrect, and the errors were immediately and politely fixed. The waffle that a customer dropped on the floor was even graciously replaced. Prices are also reasonable, and I was able to get fruit and oatmeal for my preschool daughter. Really good experience."}
{"text":"Pretty good food and they don't microwave anything or so I was told. Solid breakfast burrito and garden salad. Very convenient if you're at the Linq monorail stop. Save some time and pick up extra food and and snacks before you head off to the Strip."}
{"text":"Decided to check the Nook when I was in the Linq, menu looked good.. So asked for a Nutella crepe.. The response was, oh sorry we don't serve those 1 hour before closing.. They close at 10.. It was 9:03pm on Sunday night of memorial weekend!
Bad service! The reps can say sorry all they like, don't advertise something you can't sell customers! Never going again! Never referring my customers there either as this is bad service 101!"}
{"text":"Hustling through the Linq on my way to the High Roller with my family, my eye was caught by the Nook Cafe. It looked clean, bright and inviting, and I filed it away in my mind as a possibility for dinner. When we came back through that night, we popped in. 

The employees were consistently friendly, welcoming and helpful. They have a build-your-own salad option with loads of fresh toppings to choose from, and they cheerfully indulged my five year old son as he concocted his lettuce, raisin and crunchy noodle feast. My wife and I each got a Chinese Chicken Salad -- hold the chicken -- and it was tasty and filling. We all shared a slice of cheese pizza, and the huge slice was definitely shareable when paired with a salad. The pizza had good sauce in just the right amount, a nice crust that wasn't too doughy, and it was fresh from the oven. 

They have those cool soda fountains where you can add one of several flavored syrups to your drink (vanilla, cherry, etc.). Too bad they had Pepsi instead of Coke products!

At the end of our meal, a kind person working there discreetly asked if my son had been a good boy today and if I thought he deserved a free cookie. His eyes widened with surprise when I handed him his peanut butter cookie, which he loved!

Prices were rather high, but on par for anything on The Strip. 

This low-key, well-run eatery, with quick service and healthy options, was a winner for my family among the indulgent and heavy foods in the casinos. I'll definitely be back on any future Vegas trip that brings me to the Linq!"}
{"text":"If you want to feel like you're going to the airport and have a crappy meal it's overpriced and it's loud and noisy and miserable, then this is your place"}
{"text":"$15 for a \"meh\" sandwhich? What a joke. Never again. I could have gone to a sit down restaurant and paid that for a REAL meal."}
{"text":"I ordered the turkey BLTA and it was delicious. The place is very clean and quiet. Staff was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"We were super hungry and randomly went in this place on our way up our hotel. We ordered the supreme pizza to go and it was amazing.. or we were just too hungry that anything would've tasted good, lol. I think it was $22 and took about 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Love this little gem for breakfast
Quixk and the food is really good
For fast.food this is truly a great find!"}
{"text":"Great service the team were all friendly and welcoming  . Food was fresh  and tasty. Place was clean"}
{"text":"Nookie cookie is what I am calling this little expressed coffee shop inside the casino. 

I was waiting for our number to be called at Hash House a Go Go when I decided to pick up a cookie. 

The line moved quick and I quickly chose the peanut butter cookie but once I saw that it was two cookies for $4, I thought, \"another cookie can't hurt nobody\" so I chose the chocolate chip cookie as well. 

I should have waited until after breakfast....but we're in Vegas...who pays attention to proper eating habits?! So I ate the peanut butter cookie and OMG. This is the cookie that I've been wanting to bake at home but can't find that perfect recipe. It has a rich peanut butter taste without the flavor of butter or vanilla behind it. The outer edge was perfectly crunchy and the center was dead on moist....almost raw. It was perfect!! I wanted to hoard the entire cookie but played nice and shared it. I couldn't stop there. If the peanut butter cookie was that good...I couldn't imagine what the chocolate chip was going to be like. One bite into that cookie, I quickly realized that it was amazing. There were chocolate chips in every bite and just perfectly moist and soft in the center with a great crunch on the outer edge. Milk would have been the perfect friend with those cookies!! 

I will definitely return to Nook and will try their oatmeal cookie. Mom nom nom...."}
{"text":"Since the Imperial Palace became the Linq I had thought any decently priced food was gone.  I was wrong!  The Nook is awesome, they have simple coffee up to some awesome sandwiches and pizza.  Very convenient to our elevators...staff was super friendly.  My husband said it was his favorite place while out there!  Great job Nook folks."}
{"text":"Great spot. Get the Lamb & Beef Gyro. I had it twice in one day and it was great both times. It's a tad on the pricy side, but you're also on the strip, so it's not higher than anything else, plus, it's worth it. In exchange for that price tag you get great service, a clean place, and fresh tasting food. I'll be returning as I work nearby."}
{"text":"The express was open, but the actual cafe was closed when we got there even though the hours online said it was supposed to still be open. Customer service was not the best. Very slow. We waited a bit just to get a coffee. Wasn't anything special about the coffee. The prices were pretty high and the food didn't even look that great. We decided to get the coffee and go else where for some food. The cafe itself may be a bit better, but after seeing the menu and the prices of things for what you actually got, I don't think I'll be trying it out anytime soon."}
{"text":"Located right at the bottom of the guest elevators at the Linq, the Nook is a perfect place for a snack. My friends and I visited here a few times over our stay at the Linq. All the food we had was great. Good selection of breakfast, lunch, pastries, crepes, and coffee. My favorites were the bacon, egg, and cheese croissant and the French ham sandwich. My Americano tasted like coffee and was hot, what more do you need in an espresso? My only problem with the Nook is it is only open until 10 on weekdays, midnight on weekends....this would have been perfect for a great snack at 5 or 6 am on the way up to bed!"}
{"text":"Originally planned to go to hash but due to a super long wait we decided to pop in here . They have a small menu items ranging from a simple American breakfast to burritos oatmeal and fruit. For a breakfast burrito and an American breakfast it was about $19 (including tax). Pretty decent would recommend if you're in a hurry and need a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"The long lines, poor process, they need a manager to look at improving the flow and process. Waiting 20 minutes for a crepe and coffee after the long line wait to order is ridiculous.   But, then you see their process in taking orders, making the food, and you just want to step in there to do it yourself.   They need help."}
{"text":"Do you enjoy misery? Bad service? Terrible food? Unsanitary kitchen conditions? Then this place is perfect for you!"}
{"text":"Nothing here can be customized to your liking. Even though it was not specified in the menu, the eggs are always fried on the sandwiches and end up making for a soggy mess. The bacon was good. The eggs were gross, and the croissant was soggy and clearly soaked in butter before toasting. The only stars are for the good service we got at the counter. Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"Took family to have breakfast here since we were staying at the hotel. Coffee and beverage service was prompt and courteous, but when you order food I didn't expect to wait for 30 mins to receive two food items. Especially when you are witness to others who were behind you given larger completed orders. This was a serious case of disorganization with the meal tickets. Of course the meal was less than impressive for the w"}
{"text":"The food was mediocre at best. I didn't really care for the Apple sausage I ordered. It was lathered in grease. My cheese danish wasn't too  bad. Not somewhere I would frequent during my stay at the Linq. *shrugs*"}
{"text":"We stayed at the LINQ and was looking for breakfast food. We needed a quick breakfast before heading out for our day club, and something hearty from drinking the night before and more drinking throughout the day. Nook was convenient, since it was at the corner of the elevators as we came down from our hotel room. Nook serves salads, sandwiches, coffee, pastries, and bottled drinks.

I ordered a breakfast bagel with sausage. The bagel was huge! The bagel was about $5-$6 and it was pretty decent. 

My only complaint is that our order took a while to come out."}
{"text":"Ate here because the wait to eat anywhere else was way too long. Ordered I think it was Cuban panini, took FOREVER to get it. They made the gyros for all the people after me in line. The panini was tasty but too greasy and too small for how pricey it was."}
{"text":"The express line got me coffee when I needed it very badly. What more do you need?"}
{"text":"A-OK, but I wouldn't recommended it, here's why...

I stopped here after having a quick meeting at 3535 Bar and I just needed a little nosh before I hit the road. The selection is decent for such a small location, with multiple sandwich options of both the breakfast and lunch variety; including a few salad options as well. 

I opted for the chicken chimichurri and bacon sandwich with pickled coleslaw. They heated up my sandwich and then put it in a to-go container, which steamed up the bread and made for a messy meal. This was a tad disappointing; I mean who likes to eat a soggy sandwich with a fork. 

The bread fell apart, the chicken was flavorful, and the bacon was crispy and plentiful, but that wasn't enough to save this meal. Nook Cafe offers a lot of other food options and I hope they execute them better than mine. The staff here is super friendly and helpful, which kept the rating from slipping into the two-star rating arena. 

After the subpar sandwich I was out $14 and had a bad case of the sandwich blues."}
{"text":"I come fairly often to Vegas for work. If you are staying on the strip you shouldn't expect too quality all the time. It's for tourists and usually just a name. Cafe Nook is not the most friendly place, i feel rushed even if there is a
Scattering of people and the food is meh. It's just a place to go to for that pick me up or I just need something moment. Be forewarned, it's overpriced...SURPRISE! Haha"}
{"text":"We decided for once to NOT rent a car, but to stay where we were staying and take our chances with our vegan diets, hoping we wouldn't have to spend 3 days eating bananas.. but since we were at the Linq, we were right there at both the Nook Cafe and Nook Express..where I did get bananas but also fresh coffee, other fresh fruit, and pizza made to order.  Vegan pizza - nothing but dough, tomatoes and veggies.  The guy making the pizza asked me detailed questions about my order and then made me a great pie, even going the extra step of washing off the pizza wheel before slicing it. Nice.  

The fresh salads looked amazing, and they make juice, smoothies, etc. so any vegan should be able to make a great meal from the options right here.  FYI, all the restaurants will accommodate you - just ask and the more we request vegan options and tell management that's what we want, the easier it gets."}
{"text":"I am staying at the Linq and today, enjoyed a BLTA on MultiGrain, which is a BLT with Avocado. Delish sandwich, filling, $13, and came with a bag of chips. Staff were friendly and funny, lots of seating and nice and clean.  They had lots of healthy options for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Great little stop for grab and go or dine in."}
{"text":"I still miss the now shuttered Flamingo coffee shop for my daily bacon and eggs fix, but this does the trick. Of course, since no meal in Vegas can cost under $20 these days, an American Breakfast (bacon, eggs, hash browns), large iced tea, and a pastry will set you back $20 after tip, but it's a quick bite to eat on the way to the monorail to hit the convention center and it's reliable. 

If you're looking for a quick meal the Nook is worth seeking out."}
{"text":"This review is for the Nook Cafe (not Nook Express).
I ordered a pizza and a piece of cheesecake to go. The pizza was not thoroughly cooked through and the cheesecake was not refrigerated properly because the  cheesecake and whipped cream on it was WARM therefore I was afraid to eat it. So after spending a small fortune and tossing everything in the garbage I obviously would not return to this place!"}
{"text":"Best find in Las Vegas!!!  Delicious, healthy, fresh, natural food that tasted better than anything I've had in a long time.  The southwestern chicken salad was the best salad I've had in years, the pizza is SUPERB, and I'm very picky about pizza. Everything is made to order, fresh, with healthy high-quality ingredients.  My daughter and I ate there as often as we could during our stay."}
{"text":"This little corner shop is located in the Linq Hotel. You'd be surprised by this little place how good it is for quick service. 

I was visiting my buddies at the hotel while they were in town and I passed this place while walking to their room. After I left I thought about all the delicious looking pastries I once passed hours ago. The thought lingering in my head made me stop there on my way out.

My partner and I grabbed some coffee and pastries. I had the blueberry scone and the bear claw. Both equally delicious. Both going very well with coffee. This place has a variety of coffee teas pastries salads and sandwiches. The seating area isn't too big but there are like 6 tables across from it so it's a nice place to sit and eat. 

My friend texted me the next morning saying how good the eggs were. Their breakfast was awesome. 

After eating here and hearing what my buddy said, it's a really great place to grab something light and not overly expensive. Let's be real it's the strip we all know how over priced things can be. So if you are at the Linq Hotel give this place a once over you maybe surprised like I was."}
{"text":"Food was not very good. Sandwiches greasy and not great flavor.   I got the hangover and threw it away after one bite."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS YUUUUUUUUUMMY!!

Their pizza is literally a screaming orgasm in your mouth. It's probably one of the best pizza's i've ever had. I forgot the name of it, but it had spinach, cheese, and more cheese!! And, did I mention, it's made fresh?! :D

The price is a tad bit high, but totally worth it. Definitely recommend anyone to come try this cafe.
I'd also like to mention their salads, which I'm not a huge fan of; their chicken salad was DELICIOUS. The chicken was almost as juicy as my a*s ;)

They also serve coffee. Not their best, but it was enough to please. The service is also on point. They really radiate positivity. Great experience, and"}
{"text":"(This review is for the Nook Express.  Nook Express is open late-night, Nook Cafe is not.)

Want something affordable to eat late night in the center strip?  Here's your only choice within walking distance for Linq and Caesars Palace customers.  

Roast beef sandwich was on par with a typically office cafeteria quality.  Prices were through the roof.

If this were any other cafe in any other town, I'd avoid it.  But after a week in Vegas, a basic sandwich was calling my name."}
{"text":"Got a soft serve ice cream for $6.50. I don't know what they can be thinking other than \"I'm gonna screw over anyone who frequents this establishment\". Anyway, I guess it was my bad for not asking.
Got a really nice, big cup of (real!) ice cream with 3 scoops at the \"BLVD Creamery\" (just two blocks south), for the same price."}
{"text":"Cuban sandwich awesome. Service just ok 25 min wait for the sandwich which apparently went to someone else. Manager compted desert snd drink."}
{"text":"Meh. I stopped by Nook instead of walking to the other side of the hotel for Starbucks, thinking I was saving myself a walk and scoring a specialty coffee shop experience. That wasn't necessarily the case. Let me just preface this by saying all of the workers are sweet as can be, the customer service is definitely top notch! Alas, it's pretty much all downhill from there. 

On my first stop at Nook, I got my usual, a large cold brew with almond milk. I'm a total cold brew snob, so I should've expected subpar coffee. The cold brew was watery and didn't have much flavor to it at all, and the almond milk wasn't very creamy. I drank the whole cup, but that was due to my desperate need for caffeine rather than my enjoyment for the drink!

On my second stop, I decided on an iced vanilla soy latte. Hard to mess up, right? Well, they did it. The coffee flavor didn't come through whatsoever, and once again, my drink was super watery. The worst part was the overwhelming syrup flavor. Nook needs to get their ratios revised, because there was wayyyyy too much syrup. It was pretty much undrinkable. 

The worst part about nook is the prices. You're paying for the convenience, because it's right next to the hotel elevators, but that's no excuse to hike up the prices as much as they do. I spent around $50 on a couple morning coffees and juices. Crazy, right?! If I were to ever stay at the Linq again, I would definitely take the extended walk of shame to get to Starbucks. And that's saying something."}
{"text":"What a cute, quaint place to eat. It's a bit pricey but not too bad for a hotel. It's also the same restaurant that does room service at the LINQ. It's cheaper if you just pick it up yourself. No room service fee and 18% automatic gratuity. 
I liked the pizza and croussandwich. The BF had a double LINQ burger. FYI the burgers come with chips, not fries. 

I did enjoy the seating outside the restaurant. We got to see all the people walking by. It was pretty fun. 

Marilyn helped us with our order. She was very courteous and answered our questions. Very nice young gal. 

Would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Food was good but didn't really care for our drinks and the cashier/ordering process was a bit complicated. 

We stood at the cashier for a good 10 minutes waiting for the cashier to figure out how to ring up on iced lattes and run our credit card. Even though we ordered the sandwiches and drinks at the same time our food came out first and then later we got our drinks. My matcha latte was too milky for my liking. The pork banh mi sandwich was delicious though. Stacked high with pulled pork, fresh turnip slices, daikon, carrots, cilantro, red onions and fresh jalapeños. Delicious. All sandwiches come with a bag of chips but they only had jalapeño chips to chose from. I asked if they had any other chips but they said they didn't. I like jalapeno chips but we like to have a choice. 

Overall good food, clean place, great food presentation and convenient if staying at the Linq. Just wish the ordering service was smoother and drink orders didn't take so long."}
{"text":"This is a review for Nook Cafe Express. All of the ladies working here are super friendly and efficient! I was waiting for my to go order at Hash House with nothing to do so I decided to find the place selling half chocolate dipped rice crispy treats I'd seen a stranger eating while passing by. NCE has all kind of pastries ranging from cream cheese Danishes to brownies. I found pistachio Madeleines, powdered sugar dusted blondies with walnuts, elegant chocolate cheesecake pops, apple Danishes, and more. At the register, I found roasted edamame crunch milk chocolate bars. The smiling cashier told me they were a bit bland so I got one instead of two. The chocolate bar was ok. What really hit the spot was the half dipped rice crispy treats! I got two and each one was individually placed in a plastic container whereas everything else was in a paper bag. To my surprise, they weren't dipped in milk chocolate. I was able to buy a 16oz cup of milk for $3 since they don't have bottled milk available. Stop by for a quick snack or espresso-- located across from Purple Zebra inside the Linq hotel and casino."}
{"text":"The Nook Cafe has a limited, but decent menu. My breakfast today was a croissandwich with egg, cheese and sausage... and it was pretty perfect. Crispy, warm, flaky croissant... mmm.

The steel cut oatmeal isn't steel cut. It's watery and definitely not impressive for $6. 

This might seem silly, but the napkins are substantial. You only need one. 

Other than that, the price point was okay... not ridiculously high as it could be for a \"resort\" restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is worth finding! To get good food on the strip, you're generally going to pay through the nose. The Nook Cafe is a pleasant surprise! Generous slices of pizza with good sauce and the salads are tossed with the dressing. After all, it is the details that count. Olivia was a delight! She knows the menu and even gave us samples of their fabulous desserts when we couldn't decide!"}
{"text":"The macaroon here are amazing and it's so cheap! Get 8 of them for only $6 I believe. Wow! They taste so good like a bakery in my hometown. I got their bacon/ham/egg salad because I had a heavier meal the day before. I got ranch & Cesar sauce, mixed that together and it was really good. I haven't had salad forever and I only got that because I didn't know what sandwich to get because I'm not a sandwich person. I'm glad I got that. My friend got a smoothie from there and wow I wish I got one. It was really refreshing. I don't get why this place is such a bad review; it's cheap, healthy, and delicious!"}
{"text":"Would give them a zero for customer service if that was allowed. Asked them if they could kindly put less bacon on my bacon egg and cheese bagel and got a terribly rude response \"do you want to come and make it\"
They won't be getting any more of my service for the rest of my trip."}
{"text":"Not bad place for quick bite or coffee. 
Coffee was really tasty. 
Crepes savory were not bad. Little bit too much cheese for us other then that okay.
Chamomile tea is not bad either.
One time stop for me though"}
{"text":"Great pizza little pricey $6.50 for specialty slice, they have sandwiches and salads too."}
{"text":"Coffee is very good and strong which is a necessity in Vegas ! I love the convenience of having it right downstairs from our hotel room. The lines were varied from super busy to no one in line. The first day I got an Americano with heavy cream and hazelnut syrup and it was one of the best drinks I have had. 2nd day I requested the EXACT same thing and it was awful ! No heavy cream and no syrup and then the wench barista proceeded to argue with me ! She suggested that maybe I should have gotten a regular coffee ? UH, when I need your opinion on my coffee I will ask for it sweetie. Thanks. Bye. For a $7 Americano it better be right. The maccaroons were $1 each which is UNHEARD of... they are light, crispy and very flavorful. I got 16 to go and worth the 4 for $3 deal ! I will defnitely be back."}
{"text":"I drink matcha at home and I'm lactose intolerant so I don't do matcha lattes. I also don't sweeten it. I just love tea that much. I stopped by Nook one morning to grab a coffee and an iced matcha tea--made with water instead of milk. I appreciated that they kept clarifying I wanted it unsweetened, I imagine that most prefer it sweet so that's never a problem to me when folks try to ensure satisfaction. Props for that!

My real whiny moment is I've never been charged $6 for tea. I know the cost of milk is usually the reason for the $4-6 pricing but I looked at my receipt and was charged for a matcha latte which felt unfair since I didn't order a matcha latte. Also my total rewards was not scanned, minor thing but insult to injury. 

The drinks tasted fine. Served to me with a smile which you rarely get back home! Just kinda bummed I was charged for a latte I never ordered. Most places charge me for tea. It's crushed tea leaves and water. It's tea. I saw the color of the powder too, we aren't talking about expensive matcha powder either. Anyhow, whiny moment over!"}
{"text":"White Chocolate and Mini Macaroons are delicious. Conveniently located in the lobby of Linq. Overpriced and situated near the casino not the best experience if your trying to avoid the overwhelming smell of smoke."}
{"text":"A reliable spot to grab breakfast! It's a bit overpriced, but it's expected for a cafe located in a hotel. The sandwiches are huge and very filling! The salads were also great. They have an amazing assortment of mini condiments with mini Tabasco, mini peanut butter, to honey which I really appreciated. (: The cashiers and chefs were also very happy and friendly!"}
{"text":"Pretty good sandwiches and not as crazy priced as some places in Vegas. 

My boys had the meatball sandwich and liked it... I didn't try it so I can't vouch

I enjoyed the banh mi pork. I'd prefer it on a different roll though next time. 

Good for a quick easy meal."}
{"text":"We went to both the Nook Express and Nook Cafe within an hour of eachother today, and the staff at the Nook Express was much more friendly and welcoming. This review is strickly on the Nook Cafe.

Our cashier was not very friendly. Our reciept said Deven on it(asian, maybe Filipino), so unless he was using someone elses login, then I assume that's his name. He never smiled,  and seemed irritated the entire time. He never greeted us, and just took our order with a straight bored face. 

Food options were great because there were many healthy options. They offer about 5 different salads ($7-$9), 7ish pizza ($5.50)options and many sandwich/ grilled options. We ordered a slice of pepperoni, a slice of Margarita, and Southwest Salad, along with a small milk and small iced coffee. Prices were fair for a tourist destination. The Margarita Pizza was DELICIOUS, you can't really go wrong with pepperoni,  so that was good too. The Salad was pretty bland. Standard flavors, nothing special. 

We will probably be back for some fruit in the morning, but we're really not looking forward to it"}
{"text":"This is just a grab and go.  Fast foods, e.g. Bagels, sandwiches, pizzas, etc. that they can warm up. Fairly ordinary."}
{"text":"Thanks for the Hot chocolate & blueberry bagels it was just what I needed to start my day @ Hash House a go go which is upstairs"}
{"text":"My breakfast sandwich was a greasy, soggy, squished mess. The only good thing here is the fruit cup."}
{"text":"This place makes excellent salads. They have a build your own salad section, but the person behind the counter actually makes the salad. The have several different ingredients to choose from. I usually start with the kale and arugula and go from there. The also have great pizza and pastries. Definitely stop by here if your in The Linq Hotel & Casino. They will even deliver to your room if you are staying there."}
{"text":"Variety of items is large. Over a few days I had the cheese danish, cinnamon roll, red velvet cupcake, California burrito, and breakfast croissant. All the pastries were soft and fresh. The California burrito was ok. Breakfast croissant was soft and tasty. It's pretty hard to mess up simple breakfast items so I can't see how that could happen. Latte and espresso were good since they had a barista. Workers were all nice and efficient. I could tell they were getting a little overwhelmed at breakfast time but hey who doesn't sweat a little when they get busy? Enjoy a book and eat at the nook."}
{"text":"Good croissant, BAD and expensive coffee, blah customer service.

Note: This is for Nook Cafe, not Nook Express.

Croissant was good. Not amazing, but solid. They asked if we wanted it heated, same as any coffee shop these days. 
I never thought I'd see the day where a coffee would be both more expensive and worse than Charbucks, but here we are. The coffee is Ladro coffee,which usually isn't horrible, but the way it was brewed it had an awful acrid taste to it. Not even fine if its cheap convenience store coffee.
Customer service was blah. About as neutral as you can get. Do not go to the counter if the older gentleman is serving. Personality of a dead porcupine!"}
{"text":"When work takes you out of town, finding a good coffee shop to work remotely from can be a pain but I found THE ONE! Nook Cafe in Linq Promenade offered a solid cup o' joe, great wifi and delicious snacks while I drilled away on my upcoming presentation. 

The staff was friendly and understanding to my weird request of DECAF coffee (yes, I'm cutting back after a caffeine overload lead to major migraines last month)! Offering tips for hanging on the strip and where to find the best deals for souvenirs. Touché Team Nook Cafe!"}
{"text":"Breakfast bagel sandwich was ok. Texture was slightly rubbery and chewy but what can you expect from a quickstop food pickup"}
{"text":"Its Ok and actually the only decent option around the LinQ for a quick breakfast before you leave Sin city, Service was good, and the food is ok but It was just too crowded."}
{"text":"So why should you stop by a small quick-serve eatery hiding in the narrow corridors of a middling hotel (The Linq) in the middle of the Vegas Strip? Well, for one the folks here make some yummy sandwiches, and for two, the food is reasonably priced when you consider some of the food prices in the vicinity. They make a devilishly good and spicy Chicken Bahn Mi sandwich, and the gyro was no less tasty. The sandwiches come with a bag of chips, which add a nice crunch to this simple meal. We were fond of the hibiscus tea, too (refills are $1). There are a few tables for diners, and the whole place is spotlessly clean. If you happen to be from New England, you might want to know they offer pizza including one plate made with Vermont cheese. What? No maple syrup?"}
{"text":"Good food, good prices, but only giving three stars because I hate places that charge for a cup of water.  $1 for the cup?  What a rip off!

My friends and I made it to Nook Café right before they switched over to their lunch menu, so we were excited to still be getting some breakfast after a long previous night on the strip.  The breakfasts were cheap and delicious, so that alone would get 5 stars from me.  However, I just can't get over paying $1 for a stinking cup.  It's really too bad that a place that sells cheaply priced but delicious food would decide to gouge customers for choosing water.  

Nook Café is tucked in the way back of the Linq and is small but has plenty of seating.  Nice alternative for a quick breakfast."}
{"text":"Music was so loud that the cashier couldn't hear our order. Kept saying \"what? Huh?\" So we said if you turn the music down you could hear us and her eyes about rolled out of her head...um it's just common sense! (She then proceeded to turn the music down to take our order).
On the menu online it said there were breakfast burritos. I was then informed that the online menu was old. Great! No burritos.
Then asked for a milk and was basically handed a shot glass sized cup of milk...? What are these people smoking? I know pot is legal here in NV but can you wait til your shift is over?
Two stars for the food coming out fast and ho. It tasted ok, which for the price still sucks. The regular coffee was awful. Never again"}
{"text":"This place is inside the Linq hotel and it was really priced amazing!

I tried their breakfast and lunch and I have to say it was delicious! I had their oatmeal for breakfast which was so delicious! It had fresh strawberries, raspberries and BlackBerries! The fruit was so fresh and the oatmeal was cooked to perfection!

The salad I had was so amazing! I had the southwest salad which had black beans, , lettuce cucumber , tomato and I added Kalamata olives which made the salad perfection! The Southwest dressing Made the salad perfect!"}
{"text":"Went there twice during my stay in Vegas, both positive experiences. Very nice staff. The first time i went and asked some questions about the food. I decided not to get anything because i just had dinner (i felt bad). However, the gentlemen just smile very friendly WITHOUT giving me any attitude. Therefore, i decided to go back and got something the second timw. The lady at the cashier was friendly too :)"}
{"text":"California Breakfast Burrito sub mushroom and spinach instead of sweet peppers. Bomb! I just found my Vegas breakfast burrito spot :-)"}
{"text":"This is a nice place for some quick and tasty food, specially breakfast and even lunch. Prices are decent, although a bit high (but this is Vegas, prices are creeping up everywhere, I miss the prices of the 80's when you could get a combo lobster and filet Mignon for $9.95).

They have gourmet sandwiches and pizzas, burritos, gyros, etc., plus the traditional breakfast fare (I had an omelet with hash-browns).

In summary, good food ... but prices on the high side and service just so-so.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Soft and crunchy sandwiches, super fresh salad ingredients, and cheerful staff make this little cafe quite a delight. Licked our plates clean and looking forward to coming again!!"}
{"text":"Great coffee and quick service. I was at the back of the line and it didn't take too long to get two coffees for my mother and I. The coffees tasted great. Then I ordered 24oz of milk later that day for my sons bottle and they charged 4 dollars! That was a rip off! Especially when Starbucks had just given it to me earlier for free. Maybe you should reevaluate your pricing on that situation."}
{"text":"Stopped by here after a show for a snack and some goodies to take home.
Clean, friendly staff and a wonderful
Variety of sorts. 
My friend and myself received a warm welcome from the lovely female staff member and she explained the variety of the baked goods in detail.  
That's why each of us left with a decent size box of goodies;)
Fresh ingredients and extremely tasty items for my sweet tooth.   One of these was a strawberry lemon meringue and OH MY!  
Which is why I returned a week later and purchased some of Turkey day.
That's right, I took the easy way out- no cleaning. 
Everything is presented nicely in the cases, all aesthetically easy on the eyes and tastes GREAT!"}
{"text":"This was a nice little cafe that was always stocked w/ cafe essentials (juice, cut fruit, salads, sandwiches, and nice big cookies). Staff was very helpful, asked if I wanted to warm up my bread and let me swap out my fruit which didn't look as fresh as I want it to be. The prices are a little high but its obviously because of the extreme convenience."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just need a good old fashioned coffee and some basic brekkie- especially after a late night out in Vegas! 
I stayed at the Linq and this was right by the elevators to my rooms so I stopped in here twice for coffee and food during my stay. Nook isn't fancy and its definitely a cheaper, \"express\" cafe experience- which isn't bad! 

The coffee is decent and they can hooke you up with non-dairy options for your choice of milk (almond for me). I ordered their Spinach omelette breakfast with 2 hashbrowns and two strips of bacon on my first visit- very plain and not amazing and was super disappointed with my choice. The second time I came in I ordered the Beef/Lamb Gyros and it was much better and pretty flavourful considering all things, it was a little on the dry side.

Staff are friendly and the premises are super clean. Definitely a good stop for basic, on the go snacks and drinks. I would definitely come back, mainly for the coffee though. 
PS. They do deliver to the rooms at the Linq, so keep that in mind!"}
{"text":"Dry pastries and not organized with the drink pick up system. Expensive but good convenience"}
{"text":"This barista in the picture making my coffee,  her name is Circle seems to be so unhappy about her job. My goodness She needs to go back to training how to be courteous and friendly to customers. She's not good for this business. I was happy,  it's an easy access spot for coffee, snack for a quick bite and food to go breakfast and all but she blow everything off."}
{"text":"I'm surprising myself giving Nook Cafe a 4. It only offers basic things like salads, sandwiches and pizza as well as coffee, but it works for something quick to eat. The food is expensive given it's just a cafe, around $10 for a salad and $6 for a slice of pizza, but that's more or less what you'd find elsewhere along the Strip. The staff here are super friendly and cheery!

I got a slice of margherita pizza for $6, which they heated up for me in their wood-fire oven. The slice was actually pretty big and reasonable for the price and surprisingly good. The crust was thick so the slice held itself up pretty well despite being rather large. I usually prefer super thin crust pizzas, but their thick crust was soft and chewy. I'd definitely recommend eating the pizza while it's still warm and the cheese is still melted! I took mine to-go and only had a few bites of warm gooeyness before the cheese started to harden :("}
{"text":"The date of this review is December 28, 2016.

On the morning of December 23, 2016, my wife and I decided to have a quick breakfast at the Nook Café (not to be confused with Nook Express) before checking out and heading home.

The café is located just a few steps from the elevator banks making it very convenient for us to grab something to eat. Nook serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner. It is very small but has plenty of seating inside and outside of the café.

For breakfast, we had:

Two Eggs Breakfast with Turkey Bacon, $7.75.
2 Croissant Sandwich (Egg, Ham, and Cheese), $14.00, each $7.00.
BYO (Brew Your Own) Oatmeal, $5.25
2 Coffee 20oz., $8.00, each $4.00.

The food was very good and tasty, we both enjoyed it. However we did not like their coffee as it was very bitter. Adding extra creamer and sugar did not improve the taste.

Customer service was very friendly and helpful. Our food came out fast.

The Nook Café is a great place for food to grab-and-go. A good alternative place for breakfast."}
{"text":"Found this place when we stayed at the Linq hotel over July 4th weekend. It's actually open 24/7 so it's a good idea for late night meals or lighter snacks. They have a pretty wide range of selection from breakfast items to pizza and gyros. My boyfriend and I decided to order the whole pie for 22$. Which wasn't a bad price it was tasty. 
I really recommend getting the tricolera (or something along those lines) it's a creamy white pizza with spinach, roasted tomato and bell pepper with ricotta cheese. Ah to die for. The staff here are really nice too and recognized us by face which is sweet cause they go through so many people at a time. Olivia is super nice and helpful at the cash wrap. Definitely worth checking it out"}
{"text":"You know that pizza you can get at Chuck E Cheese or your high school cafeteria? That was pretty much the quality of the slice of pizza I regrettably got from here. At $6 it seems like an okay deal for a huge slice, but I think it was only that expensive so it can match the rest of the menu ($12 for a turkey sandwich), as it was about $1.50 in terms of quality. I feel bad leaving one star because that was the only thing I tried, but why serve something if it isn't up to par?"}
{"text":"Between the Casino & Elevators inside the Linq Hotel, a variety of tempting foods is displayed in glass countercases which draw the eye as people walk by.  A quick stop in the Nook Cafe' or Grab & Run, there's not much here to help one resist temptation.  

Convention attendees were ordering Breakfast sandwiches, while the rest of us were succumbing to such treats as pastries, scones, ice cream . . . 

Extreme Convenience, Fresh, Made-to-Order, Open 24/7

What's not to Like?"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 sausage cressant b-sandwiches.  Got back to the room with them and there was no sausage in EITHER of them.  What a rip off and the girls were rude!  Expensive to boot - 2 coffees & 2 sandwiches & a juice for $32.  Oh forgot to mention they're microwaved not made fresh."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Definitely worth walking through the Linq Hotel to sit down and have a bite.. They have two locations the first location you'll pass is a café. If you continue to walk past the elevators past Club Tattoo you will find the restaurant. I've had pizza there, southwest salad, and my friend had a turkey BLT.. I almost forgot I had a Gyro on two occasions. All the food tasted fresh and delicious. The staff was extremely polite and very accommodating. They have more than enough options. You can also build your own salad if you wish. I highly recommend eating here!!"}
{"text":"Great for a quick affordable meal. One of the only paces I found a fresh build your own salad bar. We went for breakfast twice while staying at the Linq. I recommend the breakfast plates! They are made fresh. The sandwiches are pre made then heated."}
{"text":"We ate this place for breakfast every morning. They always delivery room service to the room from here. My husband got the all meat burrito every time and o switched it up. Nothing we ordered was bad. Except to pay if you order room service but if you visit the express or restaurant it is not over priced. Limited options on the menu but everything is good."}
