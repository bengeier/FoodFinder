{"text":"We've been to Matteo's several times at lunch and dinner and we love it!  The food is delicious, the atmosphere is warm and inviting and the staff members are welcoming and knowledgeable about the food.  We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"It is our second time here. The food, service and atmosphere is 5stars. It's always nice to see an owner who takes pride in his establishment.The staff is very attentive and pleasant. It's definitely one of the best restaurants in Olmsted Falls. If you want to have great Italian food on the west side this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Took out of town guests to Matteo's and we were not disappointed. Great wine, food and service. Can't ask for more."}
{"text":"Six of us from Columbus came to Matteo's for dinner, fantastic place great service high quality food at great prices.  I would eat there once a week if I could.  Do yourself a favor and just go"}
{"text":"Awesome experience! The wait staff was exceptional and the food was delicious! Great selection and outstanding cocktails. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We held our rehearsal dinner at Matteo's and everything was great. Tom helped us plan the event from start to finish and the staff the day of our event did everything they could to accommodate our requests. Amazing food and we'll continue to support this local restaurant."}
{"text":"Had a very tasty side salad and great pizza, not a typical pizza pie but a baked crust looking more like a flat bread, didn't look like much at first but filled us up! We'll go back to try other menu items. Adorable decor and comfortable, friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"We recently had the pleasure of working with Tom and some of his staff members to have a private party hosted at Matteo's. Our time with them couldn't have been better! The planning process was simple and laid back and absolutely everything was ready when we arrived. Our servers were very friendly, attentive, and accommodating to our group and made the day special for our guests. We planned a sandwich menu for lunch and the food was amazing! I can personally say we loved the chicken parmesan and caprese sandwiches the best! Matteo's prices were very reasonable compared to other locations we had inquired about, and the staff was more friendly and inviting in assisting us with our requests. It was a lovely day for our family, and Matteo's made us feel like family that day as well. We have also enjoyed a couple quiet date nights there in the past and will not hesitate to do so in the future. Certainly, we owe a  huge thank you and recommendation for Matteo's!"}
{"text":"OMG love this place. They use Ohio City Pasta. Fairly reasonable and you leave satisfied. Place was packed but service was excellent. If you love Italian like I do try it out"}
{"text":"Was with a wedding reception last night, and just like the review from another user just a few days before, we found that the staff struggled to handle a group. They were pleasant and were clearly trying, but service was quite slow. About a third of the diners in our group had a long wait for their main course, which was awkard. No one came to ask about coffee afterwards, and someone at our table who managed to get an order in had to wait half an hour  to get it. We were happy with the food, which is very important, and we liked the space and appreciated that the servers (and surely the kitchen staff) were trying, but they're not quite there yet on serving groups. Would certainly go back for a meal though. The bruschetta was my favorite of all the apps and entrees. It was fresh and flavorful."}
{"text":"Can't think of one thing that well. Lasagna had nothing  but layers of pasta. The carne pizza was big but the meat on it was dry and too much sauce. Drowning food in sauce doesn't make it better! They weren't busy and we had reservations and still waited 45 min for food once seated. Ordered cassata cake to go and again waited 20-25 min for a piece of cake. Not only was it the worst cassata cake I've ever had, it was smashed into a small container. Never again will we be back!"}
{"text":"My daughter loves Italian food, so of course we had to try Matteo's!  We had a wonderful experience! The food was very good and the service was even better!  We even had two toddler's ages 2 and 4, and our server was very patient and even engaged the 4 year old in a conversation!"}
{"text":"Great food, service and atmosphere! Meatball sliders are a must. The bar area is a great addition."}
{"text":"Can't rave about this place enough!!!!  Fantastic food, the BEST and friendliest servers in the area, and an ever-changing menu to keep you returning.  We have never had a bad meal or appetizer here.  Homemade meatballs .. awesome!  Sausage stuffed peppers .. awesome!  Great Caesar salad, pasta and chicken."}
{"text":"We visited as a group of wedding party. They were unfortunately understaffed and service was way too slow despite the fact that arrangements were made earlier and the size of the group had been communicated. Other than that, people were nice and welcoming."}
{"text":"Solid Italian food, nice environment.  We ended up going there after another restaurant in the area was closed, and this one was around the corner.  We were pleasantly surprised, they have small and large portions for a lot of their meals, and if we hadn't ordered seafood meals, the prices would have been on par with all of the other local restaurants.  My wife ordered the Seafood Pasta (with changes that they did without trouble), and I ordered the Pollo Matteo (chicken cutlets with a lobster sauce and asparagus).  Both meals were perfectly done, and tasted great.  We also had the Wedding soup, which was excellent.  The only knock was the draft beer that I ordered was small (a snifter of a regular IPA is not an appropriate size).  With a tiramisu for dessert, we were out of there for $50, very reasonable considering what we ordered."}
{"text":"A new addition to the culinary selections in historic Olmsted Falls is Matteo's. Opened by entrepreneurs Tom Grassi and his partner Dave, the theme is casual Italian featuring recipes from Tom's Sicilian grandmother. The site of restaurant is in an old bank building that previously housed two other restaurants in the past couple of years. That record would not normally bode well as the food industry is a high risk venture.  But the partners have expanded the floor plan of their site to push to the street entrance which opens to a casual bar with the dining area in the back.  As I have mentioned in previous reviews, I have some strict preferences after living in Italy for many years. But regardless of whether you know the specialties or not, one can determine quality at any level.  Here are some quick impressions of Matteo's.  Still in the developmental stage on the floor as of this date though they have been open about a month as of 4/24/2015. The hostess, while not aloof, was not the energetic, charismatic individual I would have in place to welcome diners and make them feel this was a unique location and experience. She perfunctorily ushered us to a table and said our server, Anthony, would be along.  Anthony demonstrated a lot more energy, but lacked a great deal of finesse. He did not seem to readily know the menu, but I was willing to accept that with a recent opening. Still, with a lot riding on an open, I would have expected management to better recruit and train. Have to take a few points for not being a bit more gracious in his approach.  The tables themselves sported fresh linen with a paper liner. The diner ware had great lines and balance.  We were served warm crusty bread and a dipping sauce while the first course was being gathered. Good bread with a nice crust. The dipping sauce had the consistency and taste of an Italian dressing with a few bits of peppers and tomatoes . Nice, but I probably would have seen the same thing on my salad if I had selected the Italian dressing. Some good olive oil flavored with garlic and rosemary would be a better choice.  The co owner, Dave, returned with our first courses. A wedding soup for my friend and I took the house salad. The soup was hearty and well flavored. The salad was acceptable with a minimum of tomatoes,some good field greens and red onion. Could have skipped the packaged pepperoni and thrown in some good olives or pepperacini for my tastes.  Anthony was back with our wine selections. But service technique was lacking as he attempted to hand me the wine awkwardly across the table. Serve from the right, my man.  Adequate selection of wines by the glass though an addition of a Lambrusco would have been welcome for those who don't appreciate dry wines. (American tastes lean toward much sweeter wines.)  Main course arrived with gnocchi for my companion while I took the Italian mac and cheese with a side of meatballs and sausage.  With all the other slights overlooked, I will admit the meatballs and sausage were spot on. Moist ball of veal, beef and pork with just the right seasoning. Sausage was also excellent with a distinctive flavor of fennel. Again, would have been great to get the backstory to better promote the restaurant from Anthony when we ordered on the preparation, but perhaps that will come in time as the staff truly gets on board with product knowledge.  My dish was capivati with a mix of cheeses and a type of bacon that I would hope was panchetta. Nicely done though I would have liked a bit more cheese (it was not goopy or overcooked as most recipes I find seem to be) and perhaps a presentation that indicated that it was 'al forno' - baked. Though I was told later it was, just didn't appear so.  (the picture posted in the strip above is what it should look like....not was served to me unfortunately).    We capped things off with their version of a tiramisu that Anthony had included in a list of desserts he had some difficulty in describing fully. He did know that this tiramisu was more cake like than the traditonal and took extra effort to describe the 'discoloration' in the layers as the expresso flavoring. Perhaps not the most apt word to use, but we figured it out. It actually appeared more similar to an Italian cream cake, topped with fresh whipped cream and a strawberry glaze. Good portion for the money but not really tiramisu to me.  Bit of uncertainty with the bill which listed an item at the wrong price, but Dave was quick to handle it. (Still goes to show that it doesn't hurt to check the bill before paying)  Overall, a good experience with the bill coming in around $60. I am intrigued to try some of the other offerings and would return at some time in the future. The tables were filling up closer to 6 p.m. so diners are also interested in their fare. Good food, but I would suggest a heartier helping of 'Allegria' or 'joy or happiness' as the Italians say from the staff next time. \" Read less"}
{"text":"I heard nothing but high review about this place so I took my two sisters there. I was using the bathroom when the employee Ashley, was talking with another female employee ( didn't catch her name) about someone sent food back so she spat on it..\"extra seasoning\" she said. I'm totally disgusted! That woman is foul and I refuse to ever give this place a try. I will NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE. Who the hell spits on food? If that's the case then what else are these employees doing?"}
{"text":"Excellent service and great food. We have gone twice and both times had a positive experience."}
{"text":"The first time I went to Matteo's it was very good. The service was great. The food was good. I thought I would bring some friends with me for round two. The experience this time was very different. The service was the worst I've ever had. The food was terrible. It was dried out, luke warm, and tough. The manager was very apologetic and tried to make it right but we were all very disappointed. I think the service is very hit or miss and affects the quality of the food as well.   It took the waitress about 10 minutes to even greet our table. 10 minutes to get out drinks. 15 minutes after drinks to be asked if we wanted an appetizer. 30 minutes to get the meatball appetizer which was good. It took 70 minutes from the time we were seated to get the dinner salads. I ordered the Italian mac-n-cheese. It came out about 20 minutes after we finished our salads and was dry with extremely hard noodles in areas. She finally refilled my unsweetened tea but added no ice. We felt like nobody cared about us as paying customers. She was more interested in talking with her hostess friend. We were there August 16th in the evening. Like I said earlier, the manager was very concerned and tried to help us but I don't think I'll go back."}
{"text":"Celebrated our 13th wedding anniversary at this little gem and boy oh boy, what a great choice it turned out to be.  This was our first visit of what we are certain will many to come. Here's why. From the moment we arrived to the time of our departure, we were presented with pleasant surprises.   Super cozy romantic window side table offered right away by the cheerful hostess.  Immediate attention from our server who expertly addressed our every want and need throughout the evening.  Saved the best for last. Our food was amazing. If you do not try the wedding soup you are missing out on a little slice of heaven.  Our entrées were impeccably delicious and of such ample portion that we both had a nice box to take home for lunch the next day.  This was all done for us at a very reasonable price.  Thank you Matteo's for such a wonderful start to what proved to be one of the most romantic anniversary celebrations ever.  We'll see you soon!"}
{"text":"What a great night out at Matteo's! The atmosphere is quaint, the staff is very friendly and the service was excellent. Our courses came quickly. The bread and oil was warm and fresh, all our dinners were piping hot and delicious. The portions were very healthy, even on the small plate portions. I had the Italian Mac n'cheese and it was delicious! The gooey Asiago and Romano cheese sauce mixed with chopped spinach, artichokes and crispy bacon was out of this world. The only thing keeping me from adding a 5th star was the hostess leaving us by the hostess stand for 10 minutes on a slow night. Thank you for a lovely evening Matteo's!"}
{"text":"I really, really wanted to like this place.  Great reviews, center of our great town.  Service was fantastic as was the bread, but our meals were not.  Had Shrimp Primavera and Lobster Ravioli specials.  Both were extremely bland and lots of shell pieces in the lobster ravioli.  We may try again with classic Italian dishes- if we do I'll update my review."}
{"text":"Yummy food - everything we had was delicious!  But equal in excellence was the service.  Warm, welcoming, well-executed.  One of the best meals I have had since moving from Portland, OR.  The cherry on the cake was our super-wonderful bartender.  I would go there for a glass of wine just to see her."}
{"text":"Always have excellent food and great service. Seasonal vegetables were perfectly seasoned and cooked!  Friends and family love this place. Great location and decor. So glad we have a great restaurant in this great location."}
{"text":"Commercial Italian at best. Agree with Christine. Go somewhere else for more authentic flavors."}
{"text":"We are SO happy to have a good Italian restaurant in Olmsted Falls!  The new owners have done a complete makeover of the space, and it no longer feels like you are stepping back into time long gone by.  It has a hip feel and is inviting as it now has bar in front with windows to Columbia Road.    We tried a variety of dishes and were pleased with everything.  The meatball appetizer was phenomenal, as was the pizza.  I loved that main dishes were offered in small and large portions.  Small portion was very generous of the Lemon chicken.   Finished with delicious chocolate cake - one slice perfect for 3 of us to share.  Decent wine list.    Good attentive service.  Very reasonably priced.  We will definitely be regulars!"}
{"text":"This was about our 8th trip to this restaurant. Always had a great meal except for today. Ordered the lemon chicken. The chicken was cooked but quite bland.  The garlic mashed potatoes had no garlic let alone flavor (and discolored) and were quite mushy. The lemon sauce was either made with an old lemon or old sauce - it was darker in color than it should have been. I have ordered this several times in the past so I know.  The waitress needs more training. Had to ask her for the bread and the dipping sauce which she said was being made .  She also left my dinner plate on the very corner of the table while I was eating the salad so it had the potential of falling in my lap at the slightest tap. Like others, We look forward to the bread and olive oil based dipping sauce. Today the sauce was not the  dipping sauce. It was a vinegar-based that look more like vegetable oil and water mix together with some apple cider vinegar, didn't taste good at all.  Husbands meal was enjoyed.  We chose not to say anything because frankly reducing the price of the bill wouldn't make up for the quality of the food today.  Yelp review would likely have a greater impact.  Needless to say, I'm not giving up on this restaurant just yet.  It is a great place to dine without TVs and a lot of noise.  Enjoy the atmosphere and location.  I'll credit this experience to a new cook and waitress, both needing more training!  Hope Matteo's pays attention because We really do enjoy it."}
{"text":"Great place for a date night! We ordered a lemon drop cocktail, Chicken Parmigiano with seasonal vegetables, Fettuccine Alfredo and Tiramisu. Everything was fresh and home made,not pre-prepared and cooked perfectly. The only thing I didn't enjoy was the bread dipping sauce. It was very similar to Italian dressing with herbs added to it. There was also WAY too much Italian and Ranch dressing on our respective salads. I will defintely be back for the Chicken Parmigiano though, it may be the best I've every had!"}
{"text":"So much to say about this place. It's cute, and the atmosphere is amazing. The staff is ultra responsive and very kind. The bar is quaint but delivers a step above the normal small town establishment. Nestled in the historic area it's easy to miss but worth the visit.   The food is amazing, the staff is friendly, and the drinks are top notch. I highly recommend this stop for a casual dinner or a quite date."}
{"text":"Best Italian salad dressing I have had in over 20 years.  Brings back memories of the now closed Ottino's restaurant of Mayfield Hts.  The Lemon Chicken is out of this world.   The Bread was also excellent which is a must for Italian restaurants.   The dipping sauce for the bread was only average, but other than that everything was a 10 our of 10.   Highly recommended.  Our waitress was polite, attentive, and knowledgeable.   We will be back here again soon.   It is easily the best moderately priced Italian restaurant in southwest Cleveland area.   North Royalton should be proud!"}
{"text":"I had the calamari which was good because of the marinara sauce.  For my entree I had the veal matteo. The angel hair was overcooked and drenched in olive oil.  The veal was too done.  The atmosphere was nice and the waitress attentive.  Would I go back again? Probably to try other dishes."}
{"text":"We found this place by chance a couple of weeks ago and it has become one of our favorite restaurants. Service is great, everyone is very courteous and friendly. My wife hasn't been able to get past the Egg Plant Parmigiana, I had Veal Parmigiana and Ravioli all three were exceptional. Great salads be sure and try the warm bread with oil sauce. You must save room for desert they are wonderful."}
{"text":"Food and drinks were great.  Bread and house dipping sauce is brought out when you arrive.  The dipping sauce is very good.  We ordered Calamari as an appetizer, which was good and I had the stuffed pork chop and my wife had veal parmigiana.  Both were very good.  We then had tiramisu, which was amazing.  Waiter was great as well...only negative was we were placed in the bar area...there were a few customers there at 4:30 that were pretty loud.  Overall, I would recommend and plan on going back."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to a birthday dinner here. Sadly, it was a bit disappointing. I ordered the diablo fish i think it was sea bass. It was the 2nd worst i ever had. It was served skin up but I couldn't tell because it was buried in sauce or greens and was surprised skin was on it at all. The side of pasta was very watery! Two at our table ordered gnocchi and cavatelli. Those were good so my advice... stick to pasta if you go here. Salad, bread, drinks, and our waitress was good but we had a restaurant.com coupon and that turned into a fiasco and was handled very poorly by the bar tender who was standing in for the mgr who was on vacation even though they have accepted them previously and we asked the hostess about using it before we were even seated. On top of everything else the credit card machine was down, no gelato because the freezer was broken and they weren't able to make the original drink i ordered off their menu. I would say this was just an off night but when we finally did contact the mgr about the coupon he said it was not their policy to take them, and he would be posting it on the door.  It would've been nice to get a gift card even if it was for ten dollars to come back but we got a big NOTHING. Probably wont go back. Thats just rude and poor customer service!"}
{"text":"Four of us took our mother to their Mother's Day Brunch today. When I made the reservation for 11am I was assured we could sit upstairs. We were the first customers to arrive at 11am and after 10 minutes we were seated downstairs and told no one was being seated upstairs, no explanation given.  The main courses at this restaurant are very good but off-the-shelf Italian dressing was served to dip the bread and my Bloody Mary consisted of tomatoe juice with horseradish sauce added. They were terribly disorganized and there was a lot of chatter between the staff concerning seating and serving. Our waiter was unfamiliar with the menu and we were there over an hour before our meals were served, even though we didn't order appetizers. The staff needs work on customer service and making their customers feel welcomed."}
{"text":"Had a very enjoyable dinner. Impressed by ample portion and the food was hot when brought to the table! Will look forward to next visit"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and atmosphere!! Wonderful find. The Seafood pasta was amazing. The bread that comes extra is warm and yummy!! Service was pretty in spot after I had to ask who our server was after sitting for about 10 minutes. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"We had reservations at 6:30 on a Saturday evening.  We were quickly seated upon arrival, and taken to a table upstairs.  We were then promptly greeted by a great server, with a sweet personality. She brought bread which was tasty, along with a dipping sauce, which was like Italian dressing with peppers in it.  Not really a fan, but she quickly brought butter upon asking.  The food took ample time, came out hot, and tasty.  I order Veal Matteo, with spaghetti, the veal was not paper thin, not tough, perfectly breaded, and along with tasty red sauce and HOMEMADE spaghetti pasta!  My daughter enjoyed the small portion lasagna, enough for her to take some home, and my husband enjoyed the meatballs and penne.  I ordered tiramisu to go for only $5, it was delicious as well.  I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"My experience here was subpar. I really loved the area that this restaurant is located in, and the interior of the restaurant was very cute. However, I didn't love the waitstaff. They treated my friend and I like children and barely paid any attention to us other than ordering.  The food was alright. The salad and the bread was good, but the gnocchi was not. The gravy, supposed to be a blush sauce, tasted like pizza sauce and was too runny. Too much oregano I think.  The service was quick, and the place was pretty inexpensive. I think I'd go back, but definitely try something new."}
{"text":"I read a lot of excellent reviews on the food, so I gave them a shot. My wife and I ordered to go food, needless to say, I was underwhelmed. The food was  almost inedible. Nothing tasted fresh and the sauce tasted like it was straight out of the jar. Maybe this was just a bad night, so I am willing to give them a second shot."}
{"text":"Brought a group of coworkers here for a lunch recently, and had a very pleasant experience.  Our server was a lot of fun...very outgoing, bubbly and had a nickname for everyone in our party (we had fun with that!).  Once seated, our table was immediately brought out several baskets of warm bread and an Italian-seasoned dipping sauce that was quite pungent.  We placed drink and meal orders while we enjoyed the bread.  I ordered my favorite Italian dish...chicken parmigiano which came with a side dish (I chose pasta) and a soup or salad.  The soups and salads were brought out as a first course.  The wedding soup was light and flavorful...full of veggies, tiny meatballs and acini de pepe pasta.  Really solid.  Then came the main dishes.  The chicken parmigiano came with three (small) pounded breasts that were lightly breaded and fried then topped with fresh tomato slices, marinara sauce and melted cheese.  It came with a side of spaghetti pasta and all flavors were delicious.  The red sauce was just slightly tangy, but bright and fresh at the same time.  Dipping the remaining bread in the red sauce sealed the deal for me.  Service was great and efficient, food was very tasty and the atmosphere quaint and comfortable.  I'm sure we will be back!"}
{"text":"Don't care for the food. Been to both locations and just not my cup of tea. Bland food, slow service."}
{"text":"Excellent food; relaxing atmosphere. The Gnocchi Gorgonzola is outstanding. Try the gelati. My only criticism is that water wasn't offered, particularly since we had ordered martinis. Water should always be served alongside a martini."}
{"text":"Terrible service!! Waited over an hour just to order our food. Waiter was not concerned with our table at all, hardly ever came to check on us and didn't ever check to see how our food was. We were there over 2 1/2 mainly just waiting to order and receive our food. Ordered a $12 Antipasto salad and it was so small with literally 2 pieces of meat on it. The side salad that my friends ordered was bigger. Not impressed."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal!!! Once you step into those doors, you feel the ambiance right away. It's got a stunning look about it and the interior is gorgeous! Who wouldn't want to enjoy a hot cup of coffee with mouth-watering pastries at Matteo's!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I visited on a Thursday evening at the recommendation of a neighbor.  It's a small but very comfortable place with great service.  The menu offers a lot of choices, with very reasonable prices:  I can't remember the last time an entree included either soup or salad!  We enjoyed the calamari appetizer, the wedding soup and the side salad.  My sea bass (not Chilean) was tasty - the bed of escarole was a yummy presentation, but I found the \"spicy Pinot grigiot red sauce\" a bit overwhelming. Not because of the spice but because the red sauce itself was thick and heavy -- maybe in the heat too long?  Chicken parm was edible, but that same red sauce was an issue.  Bottom line, we'll give it another try because it teetered on the edge of being a place we really want to like!"}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant with other family members on April 7, 2016 for dinner.  My dinner, the Chicken Picata, was very good.  The chicken was moist and the sauce was delicate - not too lemony (which can over power a chicken breast.)  Unfortunately, the kitchen was really inconsistent that night.  My brother's pork cutlet was overcooked with the breading almost burnt and the meat dry.  My husband's Italian sausage was okay.  Most of it was cooked perfectly, but about a third of it was grainy.  My Casada cake was fabulous. My brother's Chocolate Mousse cake was dry - as if it had been sitting on the counter for several days.  It had to be sent back.  (Sorry bro, you had a really bad night!!)  The décor is very pleasant - not overdone.  The kitchen needs to be more consistent.  It may survive on the fact it is a small community - but I think the clientele will get over it if it cannot be relied on to have good food every night."}
{"text":"Sat in back patio.  Great atmosphere.  Service from Chrissy was A+++.  Food was A++.   Highly recommend Chicken Matteo.  Cold beers too.  Haha.  Will be back soon."}
{"text":"when i first came upon Matteo's i was really excited to try it. months go by and i just wasn't feeling it. we were looking at all sorts of places to go on Friday and we finally decided to give it a try and i'm glad we did.   i ordered the meatball appetizer. to my surprise Danielle (who doesn't like beef) liked these and i had to stab her hand a few times to keep her out of my food. i think the infection is clearing up after some antibiotics.  for dinner we didn't really jump outside our comfort zones. Danielle had eggplant parmesan. eggplant is gross. she said she liked it a lot but she might be nuts.  i had the veal parmesan. it was really good. both came with sides of homemade spaghetti and the red sauce tasted great. i was sopping up the sauce with the bread and wiped my plate clean.   also interesting was the dip provided with the bread. instead of the oil and vinegar you might get elsewhere, they gave what tasted like dressed up Italian dressing and i loved it.   Matteo's is very pretty inside and is definitely worth a shot, even if you're not in the area."}
{"text":"Took the family to Matteo's Casual Italian on a recommendation and we were no disappointed. The lady at the front desk was very friendly and her table allocation for our booking was good. The service from our waiter was exceptional, he assisted with selections on the menu and was very friendly / attentive through out dinner. We had the zucchini frites and homemade meatballs for appetizer - the kids loved the meatballs (highly recommended)! For entree's my wife and I both had the recommendation of the waiter and went with Seafood Pasta and while the squid and octopus was a little under cooked the rest was very nice. Our kids ordered Spaghetti and Meatballs (yes meatballs again) and the Chicken Parmigiana, they had adult portions so plenty to take away (box) but they enjoyed it a-lot. However the favorite part of the meal for the kids was the Wedding Soup which they loved and enjoyed immensely. Definitely would recommend this restaurant if you like Italian cuisine!"}
{"text":"A great local Italian eatery. Location in the Grand Pacific Junction in Olmsted Falls Oh makes it easy to find and dinnertime parking is easy. The food is very good my Spaghetti with 2 large meatballs was more than I could handle. Wine selection is good also the Annabelle's cab was terrific."}
{"text":"Finally stopped in here for lunch with the wife after we've been driving my it for months.  Very glad we did.  My wife's grilled eggplant parmigiana sandwich was awesome!  Perfect cook on the eggplant and not too cheesey.  I had a special with ham, capicola and bacon and it was also outstanding.  Service was good and the decor was very cool.  The best part was the fresh bread and dipping oil that was brought out while we waited.  We will definitely be going back again!!"}
{"text":"Dinner for 4 Saturday night, lucky we got a table, no reservation. They were busy. Only busines around with an nice atmosphere.  Diverse menu offering's. The items consumed @ the table were, wedding soup, great, veal, good, chick parm, ok, meatballs, o.k. mac & cheese, ok. Some of the items came out cold and have to be sent back to be warmed up. Took a pretty long time to get our food. Service is not safistacated or polished. The kids that work there could use some training."}
{"text":"The veal and eggplant parmigiana were below average sized portions and arrived like warm. Someone at our table ordered a Great Lakes draft beer that was served in a brandy glass. Obviously less than a normal pour and out of the ordinary.   Don't go out of your way for this place. There is much better."}
{"text":"This was a nice little place we stopped at for dinner. We had reservations for 4 people at 630 on a Friday. All of our meals were wonderful. The bread on the table was delicious. Attentive waitresses and a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Service was very good as was our food. Small plates are great. Very reasonable dining. Warm bread, dipping sauce and eggplant parm were all delicious. All 5 in our party were happy with their meals"}
{"text":"We were all happy with our main dish.  My salad had some questionable lettuce.  The wait at times felt long and the restaurant was not that busy.  They just need to step up service a bit .  Italian dressing is not italian dipping sauce.  Switch to olive oil with herbs and don't make customers ask for bread."}
{"text":"We just enjoyed a great lunch with family and can't wait to go back.  Asiago bread brought to table and fried calamari wonderful way to start.   We each tried a different entrée category: sandwich,  pizza, specialty dish, and pasta.   Each were fantastic!   Best part was our waiter Peter who was great with our infant daughter and taking care of us before we even thought to ask.   So glad to hear the opening week is going so well!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to this restaurant. Ambience was okay, and no loud music, which we liked because we enjoy nice conversation. Our party ordered the lemon chicken, chicken parmigiana and the spaghetti with meatballs. Note, there is no \"homemade\" pasta on the menu even though the menu states the cavatelli is homemade. An embarrassingly small amount of Italian bread was brought out for a party of 4 with one very small plate of olive oil (which was, however, nicely infused with garlic and balsamic vinegar). We immediately asked for more, and the server did oblige. Next came the salads, again embarrassing small. Nice lettuce, but only about 5 pieces and virtually no toppings ... half a cherry-type tomato and one small slice of pepperoni. The entrees were delicious and of good portion. One downside was no freshly grated Parmesan cheese to top our delicious pasta ... only a shaker jar of dry Parmesan was offered. Our waiter was wonderful, brought whatever was asked and very friendly."}
{"text":"Environment was nice, staff was very nice as well. Food needed some work. From what I was told by the manager the pasta is homemade, my entire party of 14 did not care for it at all, at all. However the bread at the table was really really good. I think I might give it another chance m... maybe ... because I live in Olmsted Township. We will see."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place.  Nice atmosphere and all.  But the eggplant parm came out overdone almost to a brick like consistency.  My dates ravioli literally sat in a 1/4 inch of butter.  I had to ask to have our water glasses refilled.  First I asked that mine get refilled and then when she came back I had to ask that my dates was refilled.  Which the waitress did.. with an eye roll.  Not going back."}
{"text":"Hakuna Matteo!  Been here twice now. Pretty good selections, you can tell they really put effort into recipes. Nice front room bar area facing street w/ cool decor.  Got coupons on restaurant. com.  Tasty wedding soup w/ homemade meatballs! Will be back."}
{"text":"OK......when we entered Matteo's for a 6:30 reservation at 6:25, we were told it would be 5-10 minutes to seat us.  Noticed an a number of 4 top empty tables......so we stood at the door along with other patrons to be seated at tables that were vacant?????   We had a party of four.  +'s = first Little Italy cocktail-Matteo's take on a Manhattan....first one was excellent.....second was made differently with the first with different garnishes to the point that i was probably drinking something different the second time around?????  Maybe they had a different bartender?   Second drink was not close to first.......so it make one wonder about quality controls.....  +'s...Italian Wedding Soup was excellent per 3 people in our party who enjoyed it......spaghetti sauce was pretty good....  so so.....breaded calamari and clams/mussels appetizer, while tasty, were  a bit overpriced for the amount of food provided.  Meatballs were so so.....  Two in our party had Shrimp Matteo and the other two had the Veal Matteo.  All four conferred and indicated the meals were good but not something that would not prompt us to return anytime soon.    The server (Hope) did her best and was pleasant and accommodating.  Owner was doing his best to take care of patrons........but the timing in between drinks...appetizers....entrees was  off a bit."}
{"text":"Went to Matteo's tonight for the first time with a party of eight. The prices are very reasonable, we had a variety of dishes from veal parmesan to swordfish to ca?ciatore, all were excellently prepared and all were very generous portions. Salads and pasta sides were also very good and also very generous portions. Nice selection of drinks and wine. The service was excellent, Hope is a great waitress, and Lance a very good general manager of the restaurant who visited the table and helped make sure everything went very smoothly. Everyone agreed that we would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I was visiting family in Olmsted Falls and they suggested that we try Matteo's for dinner. I was undecided about what to order, but I ended up going with the Caprese Sandwich because I wanted something a bit lighter. The sandwich exceeded my expectations by a long shot. The bread and basil aioli were DELICIOUS. I will definitely return next time I visit so I can try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I went for a business lunch here and it was a nice little spot. This area of Olmsted Falls is charming and this place fits right in. The food was ok, not bad, not great, but I only tried the flatbread, so I didn't have the opportunity to be really wowed. The bar area is really pretty and I will definitely go back and try it again."}
{"text":"As stated in a previous review, Matteo's is currently in transition to a new chef/owner and although they still have the original menu, the food quality and presentation is absolutely fantastic.   My husband ordered the Bolognese and I the pork chop special.  The presentation on both entrees was beautiful and eating with our eyes agreed with our palates.    Chef Kelly is doing a spectacular job and so excited to see what she has planned for the culinary future of this establishment.    A \"must visit\" restaurant.  I guarantee you will want to return."}
{"text":"Best thing about the place are the craft cocktails. Nice assortment of trendy to old school drinks. I think the problem here is a bit with consistency, we've been here about 6 times and each time something was either a bit off or good. I'm not a fan of their red sauce at all, but do think generally speaking its a decent value for what you get. We'll be back probably sit and eat at the bar ...and hope it continues to evolve into a consistent above average product."}
{"text":"Service was great and a really nice atmosphere. Great bread and the food was good too. Nice portion size-enough for leftovers!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had our first visit to Matteo's.  We enjoyed our meal and service from Sean was excellent  Portions are perfect. Very nice menu a lot of variety.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came here as I was headed to the airport from a business meeting and had a nice lunch that included a Cesar salad and Chicken Parm sandwich. Delicious food and nice atmosphere with great prices.   I don't find a lot of marinara sauce I like at restaurants as I can make better, but this sauce was flavorful. Cesar dressing was good too. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Have eaten at the bar on four separate occasions. The staff is very personable and attentive. The food portions are always generous and sometimes over the top! The smaller portions offered  are almost always large enough for a full meal. Sauces are good and taste home made which ,as we all know , is of paramount importance in Italian food.   Their mixed drinks are well made and generous. My personal favorite is their Italian mule made with lemon cello . I have recommended this place place to several friends and have not heard one negative comment. Glad to have them in my hometown."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited Matteo's for the first time this past weekend and were blown away. Probably the best italian food I've ever had (although I will admit, I am not an italian food connoisseur).   We started out with the bruschetta which was good. It was definitely more interesting than the typical \"bread and sauce\" junk you get at most places. Nice, complex flavors.   My wife had the italian mac and cheese which was tasty, especially on a cold evening. I had the Pollo Matteo's. It was cooked perfectly and the lobster sherry sauce was amazing. So good that I just put the leftovers on my salad for lunch the following Monday! The garlic mashed potatoes were good, but I'll probably opt for the mac and cheese next time. I also had the mushroom soup of the day, which was also excellent.  Service was attentive and friendly without being overbearing. As I said, I'm not much of an italian food fan, but I'll certainly be returning!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner with friends Friday night. Good menu with a lot of options for everyone.  We ordered zucchini frites, fried calamari and the meatball & sausage appetizers. The two fried items were cold and inedible. The lone meatball & sausage was warm and tasty.  I had the lemon chicken. Pucker up, as it was very tart. Accompanying broccoli was cold. My buddy had shrimp Matteo. His shrimp was fine but the pasta was mush. Neither of us finished our meals. The ladies faired a little better. One had the pork chop and one had the chicken Matteo. Both were slightly over cooked. The wait staff and management really did not help the overall experience. I can see where there is potential. I want to like it as we need more options in the area."}
{"text":"After reading many good reviews I was a bit disappointed.  Let's start with the high points.  Calamari app was very good and tender.  My girlfriends chicken saltimboca was juicy and very tasty.    Now for the lesser...   I had the Veal Matteos with pasta side.   The veal was straight out of the fryer with a very heavy breading.  My pasta side was pure mush. When i brought it up to our server she said\" \"well you know we only use fresh pasta, and sometimes that happens\".    On the brighter side, she did buy us a slice of cake that was pretty good.   Overall, I just expected better"}
{"text":"Food was incredible!, service was great, we went on a Monday night will have to try a Friday or Saturday to see if service is worse, but really like what we ordered. everything was fresh and waiter was truly great!."}
{"text":"Went to dinner tonight with my husband and son. Second time back to this great find.  Eggplant parmigiana was great, lasagna was great (had that the first visit), meatball sandwich looked great. My son said it was great.  Portions are perfect. I had left overs to bring home for lunch.  The only suggestion I would add is make the salads a little bigger.  Many people enjoy a good salad before the meal.  It was still delicious. Service was spot on.  Can't wait to come back for a third visit.   Truly is a great find."}
{"text":"Another restaurant in the same spot at the Junction-hoping this one is going to last.  Hubby and I checked out Matteo's on a Friday evening with a reservation. We live in the Falls and come from the generation of foodie, farm to table, craft drinks, craft beer-all around Cleveland scene people. When we heard that another place was open we checked Yelp and saw the good reviews so we thought well why not-we aren't really Italian cuisine eating people or at least I'm not but I really wanted to stop in and check this place out and saw fish items on the menu so we made a date.  The space looks revamped from the old dated decor from previous and was full when we arrived. There was a wait even with our reservation but since they created a separate bar area we went over to grab a drink. The new bar area was awesome! Modern touches and the bartender was super friendly, young and knowledgeable. It had a nice vibe, different from the Cleveland spots obviously but it felt nice to finally go in and have it busy. We ended staying at the bar because we liked the feel and the main dining room table they were going to sit us at wasnt what we really wanted for the evening.  As I said I'm not an Italian fare fan because I eat pretty strict so we were going to order a couple bar snacks like the shrimp but the bartender said they haven't started doing the bar snacks yet. So we ordered the pan seared calamari. Calamari was delicious! You can easily mess up calamari and it was seared perfectly.  My husband ordered the wedding soup w his meal and I had the salad w house dressing. He liked his soup-said mine is better (it kinda is) and the salad was really nice and the dressing delicious.  I don't eat red meat or pork or dairy and I limit gluten as much as possible so no bread crumbs or bread, pasta etc for me and my complaint with the restaurant is there are very little options for people like me or vegans/vegetarians. In these days of farm to table, foodies, healthy eaters, non gmo, gluten free etc the restaurants we love to visit always have a selection for the above eaters like myself so I was a little disappointed that the menu options were small here HOWEVER when I did see an entree I was interested in I asked if the chicken could just be sautéed and not breaded and dipped and the chef absolutely obliged. It was the chicken dish with lobster sauce and it was delicious and flavorful and the sauce on top fresh and bursting with richness-I obviously opted no pasta but had a side of seasonal veggies which were cooked perfect and again tons of flavor.  Hubby ordered Alfredo w meatballs and it was one of the best Alfredo sauces he has had-I took a small bite and agreed! Light and creamy-not like a heavy rich Alfredo that makes your stomach hurt and feel like a brick-his was fresh and decadent but not laden with cheap cheeses that weigh it down-honestly really good.  We did try a couple desserts the blueberry cheesecake and chocolate cake-unfortunately and hoping in the future they get an in house pastry chef because honestly places that carry their own pastry chef is a place I want to stay and eat dessert at. They were a good finish to the meal but nothing I would stay again for-not bad at all and quite good-we have just had better aka Humble in Lakewood (best pastry chef ever!)  Needless to say this place was a great night out. The meal was delicious and accommodating. It was def more modern from previous and the food which is why places stay open and get business was something I would go back too.  I would really like for them to consider adding menu item options for the non red meat, pork, gluten etc eaters by adding a non breaded entree, maybe a turkey meatball!?, gluten free pasta option and some more imaginative small plates for the bar. These menu touches and vibe touches makes people my age want to support local establishments that have tons of potential to bring in a different younger crowd then the junction is used too...someone referred to the Junction it as the wests Tremont area and I have to strongly disagree-potential could be there but the owner of the junction needs to realize what the demographic is turning to and honestly we don't want a clock store or dollhouse store-lets get trendy shops, bakeries and local restaurants in there-I'll support local if local supports what we want.  oh and one complaint-PLEASE get rid of the \"shared\" bar snacks! They had pickles and bacon bits at the bar that was being passed around with skewers that I saw people use the skewer, take the pickle off while touching skewer with fingers then placing it BACK in jar-EEEEWWW! Unsanitary. Each patron should have their own bar snack and then cleared when done not passed down the line for others to eat from!!!  We will be back because the pizza menu looked divine! Oh and I forgot! They use Ohio city pastas-so yeah pretty Delish!"}
{"text":"We used to eat Chef Kelly's food when she worked at Oggi, so we were excited to try out her new restaurant.  Our friends met us in the spacious bar (large deck area too if you want to sit outside.  They have a nice selection of drinks and Chrissy and Nicole took great care of us.  I had their \"new fashioned\" made with Cleveland bourbon--very nice drink.  For dinner we stuck with traditional pasta dishes.  Our server recommended the Bolognese sauce, slow cooked, lots of flavor.  I could see Carmela del Busso's influence on Kelly's cooking.    We wrapped up our meal with delicious homemade cannoli and house made limoncello.    I am always happy to support local, independent restaurants and I am expecting this place to only improve as they work out some of the minor kinks. (I also hope they do some remodeling to make the dining room a bit more cozy.)"}
{"text":"We've been trying to get to Matteo's for sometime after hearing rave reviews from family and friends.  They were spot on.  Fantastic service and the food is outstanding.  Traditional Italian recipes prepared with exceptional care.  One of my new favorites.  I cannot wait to return and share with our friends.  A real gem !!!"}
{"text":"Just amazing!!! I'm ecstatic that the area FINALLY has a good Italian restaurant! From our appetizer to our dessert, (which I usually don't get dessert but everything else was so good we had to try the cannoli,) I have not one complaint. The service was great as well. Be sure to try the wedding soup!"}
{"text":"What a great original place with a bar area upfront and the restaurant in the back. Love the setup and the Casual Italian focus, but with quality food and service. A terrific meal on a Sunday night. Excellent meatballs appetizer and also got the Cavatielli and lasagna.  I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"I personally like \"\"NY\" style thin crust pizza,so not a fan of their square &doughy pizza,but did enjoy their pastas dishes when I tried them."}
{"text":"Matteo's is the best choice for dining out in Olmsted Falls.  Great atmosphere (especially in the bar area) attentive service, and good food.  Recommend the meatball appetizer."}
{"text":"After my third visit to Matteo's, I felt I had to give my review. I experienced consistently friendly and attentive staff and delicious food.  Two things stand out for me and will be the reason for coming back.  First is the fresh, home made pasta. Not too many restaurants do this. There is definitely a difference in the taste and texture. And their sauce is wonderful. I wish I could figure out how to copy theirs and make it at home.  Past restaurants have had a difficult time lasting in this spot in Grand Pacific Junction. I encourage people to try Matteo's so we can keep this gem in Olmsted Falls."}
{"text":"We went with some good friends on a  Sunday night and we had a wonderful time together. We were not rushed and the server was very friendly. We had cocktails and appetizers to start (Calamari and Zucchini) which I would order again. The dinner of lemon chicken was delicious. We will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Generous serving, friendly staff, quaint atmosphere. Delicious made from scratch spiced oil for bread dipping. The pollo Matteo consisted of three generous pieces of breaded chicken accompanied by a light delicate lobster sauce. While I wanted to order the garlic mashed potato side, my responsible side won out and I ordered the season veggies. Usually I find veggies to be sad - but these were tasty - can't believe I put the words vegetables and tasty in the same sentence."}
{"text":"NOT RECOMMENDED.  Bad food. Like...bad. Went here for lunch with my parents. We all got salad, the Cook hid slimey (slimy? Slymeeee?) lettuce under the regular lettuce. The meatballs were flavorless and only my 3 year old liked dipping her bread in the \"dipping sauce\" (Italian dressing). Overall I would definitely not recommend this place unless you want to pay too much money for bad food."}
{"text":"Hosted a graduation party of about 35 people upstairs. The staff was super friendly and helpful. The food was amazing. Everyone loved the lasagna. The prices were super reasonable given the amount of food you get plus the awesome service. I don't have a single bad thing to say about these guys. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"So many things wrong with this place it's hard to know where to begin. First of all, I ordered the side salad and they messed it up so bad. Like they don't know how to make their own salad. No red onions like menu said but did find a stray orange section in it. Ordered the stuffed mushrooms and when it came out there were 2, count em, 2 mushrooms. It cost 12 dollars. And don't get me started with the bread. Omg, Italian dressing for dipping?  How about a nice olive oil with pesto?  My lemon chicken was ok. Nothing to rave about. And it took an hour to receive our entrees. Do yourself a favor and go to dagneses on 82. You'll get 5 mushrooms for 8 bucks and they're scrumptious. If you're going to do a hack job then charge the appropriate amount. Oh, and we were asked if we wanted Parmesan cheese, the waiter actually brought over a jar with the cheap kraft cheese. If you're charging those prices I expect fresh grated parmigiano !"}
{"text":"We stopped at Matteo's after getting our kids from the airport. They were starving so I called ahead. When we got there, we were made to feel very welcome! The service was stellar and so was the food! We travel and dine out a lot and the entire family was happy here. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Recently moved to the Cleveland area from California and this was the first restaurant my family and I came to. We had to see why the ratings were high; however my expectations were not too high. Staff was very friendly, drinks were made well, and the food was great.  For the three times I've visited, every meal was wonderful. Highly recommend the seafood pasta in the white sauce/broth."}
{"text":"This was our third trip to Matteo's and the third time we've had an excellent experience. The food is always fresh and flavorful! And the service is attentive! We will continue to frequent this restaurant!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had our wedding rehearsal dinner here in the upstairs private room on 8/17/17... and we had a fantastic experience, with lots of compliments since from our guests! The restaurant itself has a warm atmosphere, with an attentive and friendly wait staff. And the food is just delicious! We had chicken parmesean, spaghetti, seafood linguine and more, and there wasn't a bad bite in the lot. Wine flowed freely, and many enjoyed gelato or cannolis to end the night!  The manager, Tom, was a pleasure to work with leading up to the event. And he stopped in personally to ensure the night was going smoothly, and that we were satisfied with our experience at the end.  I highly recommend Matteo's for your next event, or just a nice dinner out! This was already my mom's favorite restaurant, as a local... and now my husband's parents (and we) can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This visit was very different from our first which I reviewed earlier. The place was completely full including the bar. The hostess seemed shell shocked and our waitress was frazzled. Service was less than stellar. Our drinks arrived promptly after we were seated at a very small bar table which was our choice as the bar was quieter than the main  dining room. Orders were taken and salad arrived the requested ground pepper came as we finished the salad. Water arrived only after three requests. My wife's pasta was nicely done with spicy fra diavola sauce. My veal was over done but the cheese on the top was only partially melted and the  pasta was under done.  My guess would be the kitchen was overwhelmed. We will be back but will avoid Saturday nights. It's a great place when it's not crazy busy."}
{"text":"If the guy who.owns this place wants to stay in business, he's going to have to get it together.  We stopped in for the first time for lunch, mid afternoon. The only customers in the restaurant at the time and for the duration of our visit was our party of four and a gentleman eating alone.   The inside of the establishment is very clean and decorated nicely, but it was quiet as a tomb - you could probably hear a mouse fart in the kitchen. We felt uncomfortable having a conversation because everything echoed like we were in a museum, so we found ourselves talking just above a whisper.   As former food service industry workers, we know the job is definitely hard work, so we believe in tipping based on quality of service - 20% is a suggestion, it isn't mandatory. So when we have a server who is fantastic, we tip at least 50%. The one server working at this place had two tables to take care of and had the personality of a wet blanket, was bizarrely slow with everything and appeared to be inconvenienced by our presence ... between the deathly silent atmosphere and her demeanor, we were legitimately confused.  Now the food finally arrives (it took 45 minutes) and it's just \"okay\". It wasn't awful, but it wasn't any better than Olive Garden either. We tried salad, soup, the chicken parmesan and some kind of sandwich - the soup was quite tasty though and the bread was delicious but the dipping oil was just Italian dressing.   Overall, it was a mediocre experience at best. If this place wants to stay in business, they have alot of work to do."}
{"text":"This place just opened.  The servers were nice and the food was good. I felt it was a bit pricey for what you got, but that's just my opinion. I would say the dinners are in the $15 range   We got the zucchini appetizer and it was really good. The bread was crusty, fresh and delicious as was the dipping sauce that came with it  I had the eggplant parmigiana. It was ok, but there were only 2 pieces of thinly sliced eggplant and I didn't love the house sauce.   My husband had the veal parmigiana and he said it was good. I could hear it crunch across the table  Dinner came with a salad (or soup) and the salad was good too  We ordered coffee and brownie cheesecake for dessert. Both of those were fantastic."}
{"text":"Been in twice and not being a big Italian fan, must admit I was pretty happy.  Wife & I hit for our anniversary in November and left impressed.  Looking to take the family out for a nice X mas dinner, once again came here.  Kids were huge fans and very reasonably priced for food.  Beers on the other hand were a bit pricey, but that's life in restaurants now.  Good food and atmosphere for any gathering."}
{"text":"I made reservations for 18 for a Sunday evening.   I confirmed the day before and even received a text confirming the reservation.   We arrived, and they only had a set up for 16.  They were able to squeeze another table at the end, but I was worried we were off to a bad start.  Once we were seated, they started slowly pouring water for everyone and eventually brought bread and butter, and one bowl of dipping sauce.  We were there a half hour and still no drink orders taken.  They finally did that and the server had no idea who ordered which drink and made us all quit talking so he could call out the drink name and the owner would claim it.   Not how I would normally expect a group to be served.  I finally went downstairs and asked a server if they could start taking our food orders.   Her response when she got to our table was \"I was told I needed to start taking your orders\".  Again,  it was not what I expected from a server.  Once we got past all that, food came quickly.   I had the wedding soup which was ok.   There was way more broth than substance which was disappointing.   I ordered the lasagna which I really liked.   It was thick and hearty and the sauce was very good.   There were little meatballs in the layers which was very cute and yummy.   My husband had the veal Matteo and loved his choice.  The portions are big and presentation was nice.   All food came out hot, which I love.  I will agree with many others that the dipping sauce is like an Italian dressing, which seems odd to be served with bread.    Our checks were delivered in a timely manner.  Not sure why things started out so poorly,  but glad they got better as most people liked their meals and would be interested in returning."}
{"text":"Love this little Italian restaurant service was awesome and the food was really really good... I will be back!"}
{"text":"Cute little Italian joint. We were there on Mother's Day for dinner and our server was friendly but a bit overwhelmed so it took a really long time for our apps and bread but we knew how busy she was so we just gabbed. Apps were yummy: bruschetta, zucchini sticks, Brussels sprouts, stuffed shrooms. Salads were good. The entrees were huge and everyone enjoyed their order. The lasagna was the size of a Buick, chicken parm was enormous, meat ravioli was very filling. Other dishes ordered were gnocchi, stuffed pork chops, spaghetti with meatballs which was hilariously huge. The marinara was very basil-heavy. Nice spot in Olmsted Falls to walk around after for ice cream and to check out the wedding gazebo."}
{"text":"Fantastic Italian - I've been coming here on a regular basis and love this place, great food, good service... can't go wrong."}
{"text":"My husband and I just left Matteo's. I'm not sure what a previous reviewer was referring to when he said the restaurant was too bright. It's a lovely restaurant with beautiful linens on the tables. I have been in some restaurants that were so poorly lit you couldn't read the menu. In any event, my husband and I both had a martini and they were great. My husband had a veal dish and I had the small plate of lemon chicken that came with either a cup of soup or a salad. I opted for the wedding soup which was truly homemade and delicious.  The lemon chicken perfect over angel hair pasta. Not too lemony. The owner stopped at our table twice to make sure everything was good. They have a nice bar area as well.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wonderful dinner last night. Meatball sliders and zucchini appetizers were great. I had the veal parm with spaghetti and a meatball. Portion sizes were good."}
{"text":"Do not eat here if you eat vegetarian/vegan. Asked the server if there was meat/meatballs in the sauce. We were told no so we ordered pasta in marinara and a side salad. When the side salad came out it had pepperoni on it. When the pasta came out it had meatballs and cheese on it. We sent it back. The second time it looked good until we found a piece of meatball in the sauce. Very dissapointed! Will not go back."}
{"text":"I finally was able to make it to, Matteo's and I came with high expectations. I was let down. The dining room was way too bright. The lighting didn't set any type of mood. Our server, although he was younger was unprofessional. He made us feel rushed the entire time and had to order so he could get us out of there. We like to take our time when we go out and we weren't able to do that. He used words like \"freaking\" and just never let us relax.   The bread was like baby portions. We were given 4 bit size pieces and had to ask for more, twice. I have never sent back a drink but I did at Matteo's. It was an Old Fashion with nothing but ice. Even the remake wasn't much better.  The salads we had were bite size too. It was pathetic. The food was sub par. We both got the Gnocchi. It really didn't have any favor to it.   I'm sorry to say I won't be back or recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Great food, great service! The warm bread (Asiago cheese bread?) was delicious..... The new bar area is a great addition. A welcome addition to Olmsted Falls restaurant scene - the new Tremont area out west! ;) Also loved that they offer 2 portion sizes on many dishes! Eggplant parm, Italian Mac 'N Cheese, flatbread pizzas, spaghetti & meatballs all yummy!!!"}
{"text":"I saw all the reviews and figured it would be a great place to grab some Italian. WRONG. Literally the WORST food I have ever eaten. Our waitress was very nice. The older woman at the door was extremely rude to my husband when he asked where the bathroom was. Our wait for dinner was a little long even though they were not busy at all. There were maybe 4-5 tables besides ours.   Fried mozzarella for app, was clearly not homemade, but tasted good because we were starving. Bread and dipping sauce came out with our side salads. The dipping sauce was their Italian dressing with diced cherry tomatoes in it. Would've preferred some oil and seasonings like everyone else does. The salad was basically 8 pieces of Italian lettuce, 1 little piece of red onion, 2 pieces of packaged pepperoni, 2 halves of 2 different cherry tomatoes, a slice of cucumber, pizza cheese and a ton of dressing served on a tiny plate. Not bad, but not Italian restaurant quality at all.    Dinner came out and my bowl of spaghetti and meatballs was huge. 2 huge meatballs, I couldn't wait to eat. My noodles were soaked in an orangish colored sauce and on top there was a scoop of red sauce with the meatballs. Odd to have 2 diff sauces. Literally looked like a can of Chef Boyardee. My first bite I thought must've been melted cheese because there was no consistency, but it tasted weird. It was the noodles, there was no cheese. They were so over cooked, not seasoned at all, and honestly tasted gross. My entire bowl was a giant stuck together pile of flavorless mush..that includes the meatballs. They looked great, but had zero flavor and were very wet and mushy. I ate 2 bites and made my husband taste it (he's Italian and was insulted by this food). He had the chicken parm which came with the same awful pile of spaghetti mush. He could pick up his entire pile of pasta in one scoop. The chicken parm was 3 little cutlets spread out with 3 thick slices of raw tomato hidden under broiled cheese. The chicken tasted ok, but don't understand why there was raw tomato on top and why it wasn't just 1 breaded chicken breast.   We politely explained to our waitress that the food was terrible. We didn't even want to try anything else. Just wanted our check so we could leave and grab dinner elsewhere. She apologized and said let me see what i can do.. We were told the head cook wasn't there and neither was the manager.   The chicken parm was removed from our bill, BUT WE WERE FORCED TO PAY FOR A SPAGHETTI DINNER THAT WAS NOT EDIBLE. Left our name and number for the manager to call us....  With tip (because our girl was nice) our bill was $40+ for some beer, an app, 2 side salads, and a spaghetti dinner that had 3 bites missing.   Manager has reached out to us. Our $ is being refunded. Husband received a call and I received a message through yelp. Very much appreciate being contacted."}
{"text":"This is my wife's and I first visit to Matteo's in North Royalton.   The restaurant is currently in transition to new owners but for now, the original menu is in place.   The dining room is open and spacious. The booths are very comfortable.   We were seated immediately and our server took our drink orders immediately.   We didn't get anything special, Coke and water, but it was delivered quickly.   Refills happened equally as fast.   For starters, we ordered the bruschetta (pictured). It was light and perfectly topped.   We both opted for side salads with our meal and got the house Italian dressing.  It has a nice zing to it.   The Mrs. ordered the lemon chicken with a side of linguini. She remarked how flavorful it was. I tasted it and agree. It's a keeper.   I ordered the chicken parmigiana with a side of spaghetti.   It was everything chicken Parma should be.   The portion was very generous so I will be able to enjoy this for lunch tomorrow.   For afters, we shared the cannoli. Very tasty and just the right size.   Overall, we're very pleased with our experience and can't wait to see what culinary awesomeness Chef Kelly has in store for Matteo's in the future.   We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I am new to town and have reservations at the Pinot's Palettes class. So I arrived early to try this hidden gem. The food and service was superb and my waitress was so friendly and attentive I could not wait to highly recommend this restaurant. I will definitely be back. I had the lemon chicken and can not remember a more tender and flavorful meal in my life. Usually chicken can be chewy, but not here. I literally melted in my mouth, and the sauce was incredible."}
{"text":"What can I say about my time in this restaurant? Horrible, would be kind.  You can't call a salad a salad if you only have 5 leaves and they are mostly red coral, a ton of cheese and dressing from a plastic bottle. The tomato sauce was beyond disgusting. You can't take mass produced canned tomato sauce and throw in herbs to a point you can't taste tomato anymore and call it homemade.  The lentil soup had so little lentils and so much pork in it that they should change the name.  It was also not very good tasting.  It was another dish that tasted like it came from a mass-produced facility and the same herbs that they dumped into the red sauce.  If you list a chicken dish that is dipped in Romano cheese and sauteed with tomatoes, you assume the chicken was sauteed, no, it was FRIED, tasteless and not worth a second bite. I had the steak with mashed potatoes. The steak was acceptable, but if that is the only good dish, I'll go to a steakhouse. The potatoes had a very bland potato flavor, needed salt for some flavor and looked grayish-brown that was not very appealing to the eye. We had a side of Mac & Cheese, how can it be watery and the pasta so soft it fell apart just looking at it. I will not be returning to this place.  Since I did eat the steak, we picked up McDonald's for my wife on the way home."}
{"text":"Ever since Kelly took over as head chef, this place is superb in my books. I loved Kelly at Oggi, and am so excited to try her delicious, seasonal and inventive dishes at Matteo's. Love!"}
{"text":"My family and I ate here on Sunday, December 3, 2017.  While the food was good, the service was not.  We waited way too long for our salads after eating our appetizers, and had two ask three times for drink refills.  At one point, we pointed it out to the manager, who basically did nothing.  The manager should have made an effort to assist our server or find assistance for our server.  She never returned to our table to see if things were fixed to our satisfaction.   Our server was doing her best with her limited resources.  Probably would not return."}
{"text":"First and foremost I don't like Italian food, it all tastes the same and it's always the same menu; that being said Matteo blew my mind. The bread and dipping sauce you get is DELICIOUS. I started with the clams and mussels which I found to be a very generous serving. My dinner was the spaghetti and meatballs, so good, my only complaint was I wish there was a little more sauce, but that's my own fault for not asking for more because I like my spaghetti with a crazy amount of sauce. Trust me on this, get extra meatballs because they're that good. I had the Italian wedding soup instead of salad. Matteo touts this soup as the best you've ever had, it was OK. Desert was cassata cake. Once again very good. Drinks were awesome. The service was stellar even with how busy it was, our waitress was alway smiling. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Went here because the reviews were good. Was not disappointed. I sat at the bar and enjoyed attentive service. The food was excellent. This is clearly a \"local\" joint, but I felt welcomed. The wedding soup was quite tasty, as was the lemon chicken."}
{"text":"Well, we'll never go here again... what a shame. My family and I are newer to the area and have always wanted to just walk around Olmsted falls. We got that opportunity tonight, even though it's a little drizzly. We strolled around and decided on Matteo's Casual Italian. We shook our umbrella and walked in. An older blonde woman at the hostess stand and a younger boy were standing at the entry presumably to greet. I walked in with my two boys and said hello and we were clearly given the once over and a very cold hello. Enter very awkward silence... as she stared us down. I looked around and the ambiance seemed a bit stuffy (not the casual it advertised but more of a date night place but my family and I, other than being a little rained on were dressed more than appropriately my husband and I both in collared shirts.) I widened my eyes and said we'd like a table for four please. Her gawk continued, then an audible scoff... do you have a reservation? Followed by an eye roll. I quickly apologized and said we did realize we'd needed one. She was done with us. No apology from her, No offer for a table at a later time, no wait list. (Although when I hopped on Yelp it confirmed that there were 3 tables available a bit later.) To whomever runs that restaurant, I would ditch the snob at the front door. She's supposed to be the face of your business.)   Ok then, we walked away never to return again. I've never felt such disinterest or snubbing in my life."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness this place is WONDERFUL. My family is Italian, so I have had lots of authentic meals, and this place made me feel right at home. Service was fast and friendly. The ambience was perfect for my group of 4. Quiet, dim lights, easy for conversations.  The portions are generous and prices very reasonable for what you get. I had the lasagna and it was incredible. We ordered cannoli to share for dessert. THE BEST cannoli I have had in a long time. I wish I was from the area and could turn this into one of my regular spots."}
{"text":"This a great place food 5  for 3 star price  chef Tony  rocco is off the hook best food I have had long time"}
{"text":"I walked in a little nervous. As a 19 year old with older parents I was worried how a new place would sit with them. It's not that their picky it's that their stomachs are picky for them. We were seated and waited a little while before our waitress came and took our orders. She was INCREDIBly friendly and helpful answering all the questions my mom asked. Dinner took awhile that's standard with a good Italian cuisine. In the meantime, she gave us fresh, warm bread with a delicious house sauce similar to an Italian dressing.   My parents got veal cutlet sandwiches with sauce on the side while I got the Pizza Fruiti De Mar. The veal was well cooked, crispy, not greasy at all! The sauce that came with it was a little bitter for my parents taste but coming from an Italian family that loves their sauce on the sweeter side, you may take our words with a grain of salt. The pizza was excellent and the lobster Sherry was a wonderful complement to the mozzarella cheese and shrimp.   For dessert, I got the cassata cake, my mom got the cannolis, and my dad got the chocolate mousse cake. The cassata cake was light, delicious, and not overly sweet. The cannolis were INCREDIBLE! My mom said they tasted like my Nana's (my great grandma) which is one of the highest compliments a restaurant could ever achieve. The chocolate mousse cake was very rich and full of cocoa so it wasn't my cup of tea but my dad thoroughly enjoyed it.   All in all an amazing experience and we'll definitely be coming more often"}
{"text":"I hosted a bridal shower for my daughter yesterday at Matteo's. What a fabulous experience. I can't praise them enough. The shower guests were raving about the food which was delicious. The service was exceptional. We ordered 37 meals and they were served quickly and nearly everyone was served at the same time. The lemon chicken was a big hit. I had the lasagna and I can't wait to return to Matteo's for more. The restaurant is beautiful and super clean. The owner, general manager, and the event planner, Sarah were all in attendance and checking on us regularly. Guests were overheard saying that it was one of the nicest bridal showers they had ever been to. Thanks Matteo's!!"}
{"text":"Nice place, cozy, ate at a high top in the bar with my daughter to celebrate her birthday.  Person waiting on us was very nice and enthusiastic.  Had calamari appetizer which comes with some marinara sauce - it was good marinara, but nothing special about the calamari itself, it was pretty bland.  Otherwise, I have to say the food was really good, portions just right, not obnoxiously huge but plenty to eat.  Shrimp/scallop bisque was good, didn't taste like anything I've had before, but really pleasant.  I had some type of vegetable ravioli, (Ortaggio, I think it was called).  Nice, buttery sauce with herbs and the pasta tasted fresh, like it was homemade, with vegetable filling that made for an interesting consistency and taste for ravioli, I liked it, again a little unusual, but nothing really exotic.  My daughter had fetuccini alfredo, she said it was great.  Good wine selection, I thought.  Overall, a really good dining experience, and pretty reasonable.  And like any Italian place worth its stripes, the cannolis at the end were out of this world.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"We are from out of town, found this place on Yelp, and it is a gem.. In a nice neighborhood, can eat in the dining room or the bar, and the food was yummy!  The house salad is fantastic, our entrees were great, and the service was outstanding.. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is in such a cute location in downtown olmsted Falls. You go into the side of the restaurant and upon walking in you see white linen on tables and it is so pretty. We were seated by the bar and it was kinda cold but the food was super tasty and the bread was terrific I could eat a whole loaf I think I did eat a whole loaf."}
{"text":"We went to Matteo's last night and had the zucchini frites, they were okay but the garlic aioli was lacking. In my opinion it just didn't pair well together. My kids split a pizza. It seemed... fresh... the dough was still very sticky. As if it hadn't been cooked long enough. I ordered the chicken parmigiana and it was very, very, veeeeeery dry. It tasted like I was eating a thickly breaded dried out piece of chicken with no sauce. My husband ordered the chicken saltimbocca and gave it a C- he didn't go into specifics but this man is pretty easy to please. The worst thing we got was the Italian wedding soup. WOW was that bad! All the vegetables were still hard, the broth had no taste except pepper (and lots of it) and I didn't have a single meatball in the soup.   The wait staff seemed friendly.   This place was truly terrible though and a was of $100 for a family night out. Please save your money"}
{"text":"Had a great dinner with friends at Matteo's,service was outstanding our server Hope was very efficient,helpful,and friendly.The food was delicious,and served hot. The manager was always present and friendly.First time for us but not the last."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good, but by no means not the best Italian I've ever had. We try the pizza and pasta. The pizza was definitely a lot better than the pasta was. There were a lot of toppings on it and he sauce was pretty tasty too."}
{"text":"Service was terrible and the food was inedible. The server was slow and unfriendly. I can't believe the positive reviews on this place. The \"fresh\" pasta was a sticky glob, all of the sauces were bland. The prices were high for the food we received. Will never come here again."}
{"text":"Great food. Wife has pasta with blush sauce. I had lemon chicken with lemon sauce.  Sauted calimari. Wedding soup.  Nice bottle of wine.   I'd highly recommend it.   If I had to nitpick something, I'd say the service seemed very rushed. The waiter was fine, but seemed more interested in getting on to the next table. Just inexperienced I'd say. He did get us what we asked for.   Great food quality at a great price"}
{"text":"2nd round.. just as good as the first time. I look forward to date night at Matteo's on Sunday. Excellent food. 1/2 off bottles of wine.. oh and dessert.. love love love this place and the company."}
{"text":"I am so happy to have this restaurant here in Olmsted Falls! We've needed something like this for awhile in Grand Pacific Junction and glad they were able to remodel the interior (MUCH more comfortable), front bar is a great addition (and taking over a front storefront was smart so people can find them as earlier restaurants struggled with that being hidden in the back)...excellent food and menu has good variety and pricing options to keep everyone happy...love that there are two portion size options on the menu! I've been there twice and, each time, the food has been very good and staff very friendly and accommodating. Faves: Chicken Parmesan and Lasagna (good salad, bread, and Italian Wedding Soup too)....plan on going a lot more (in fact, going tonight! ) and spreading the word!"}
{"text":"Great service i would give then 5 stars alone. Were they lost me was on their food, I had  ordered the veal chop with herb mash. and mix veg. When it was presented in front of me I was sadly suprised that the chop it self was a mushy mess with balsamic dressing swirlled over it.  When cooking a veal chop you want a crispy outside and a juicy inside so that fat can render down and add flavor to the chop. But the fat on mine looked like that of fat on raw chicken.  Not to mention the chop itself and the veg tasted as though neither had been seasoned , not even salt and pepper."}
{"text":"The owner was kind enough to reach out to me for another try and I can say that this was definitely a worthwhile experience. I had the gnocchi with blush sauce and it was phenomenal. The tiramisu was also fantastic and the portion was lovely. Definitely a good pick. I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"I'd been meaning to go to Matteo's for a while.  It has adorable decor and I've been told they really upgraded the space.  It had a wonderfully modern and current feel to it, with colorful photos of italy and succulents abound.    The food was actually quite good, it just wasn't great.    We started off with bread and a quite nice but garlicy dipping sauce.  They were a little light on the bread and we actually had to ask for it to be refilled at least two other times.  We're not big bread people, but a tiny slice per person just looks skimpy.    We ordered the the Meatball starter, Mac-and-Cheese, Ravioli, Lasagna and Gnocchi.  Specifically the Lasagna was huge, but though it was filled with everything in the book (including tiny formed meatballs - strange?), it just seemed to be lacking in flavor.  The Gnocchi was good but chewy.  I'm not sure if they'd been frozen or vacuum packed, but they weren't the light fluffy gnocchi that I look for.    Lastly we ordered a cannoli.  Again, the stuffing was a bit dense and had less of a ricotta taste than I'd prefer (it was almost like an icing?)  I'm being picky, but I feel like with Italian restaurants, there are plenty of wonderful options out there where everything is handmade, flavorful and better than expected.  Matteo's is still a nice local option for the area, but if it were me, I'd make a drive."}
{"text":"Fantastic atmosphere, great food, and great wine. I loved my first visit to Matteo's and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to eat delicious Italian food in the area!"}
