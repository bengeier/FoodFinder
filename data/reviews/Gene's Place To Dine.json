{"text":"It's so funny that I've driven by this place countless times and never noticed it.  I went here at the suggestion of a friend who raved about their breakfast.  It's located at the end of a strip mall plaza.  Even on a Wednesday afternoon the place was pretty crowded and the parking lot was an absolute nightmare.  Inside the restaurant is cute, retro décor, WW2 propaganda, Glenn Miller playing softly through the speakers.  The atmosphere was cozy and I felt like I was at my grandparent's house.  The server was very nice and he was dressed like Robin since it was Halloween, which doesn't have anything to do with the experience, but I thought it was cute.  I got some sort of bacon, peppers, and potato omelet which came with really some really tasty hash browns.  The bacon was cook PERFECTLY, like frame it on the wall picture perfect.  My better half got steak and eggs with pancakes and the pancakes were awesome.  The steak looked a little sketchy, but the taste was all there.  The menu says they make their pancakes from scratch and you can taste the difference in these.  Their menu is simple and it looks like they have a lot of sandwiches and burgers, all with names like the Humphrey Bogart and Frank Sinatra.  Now that I am aware this place exists I will be back."}
{"text":"High Class diner food, with soon to be high school drop outs serving you, truthfully this place is only still around because there is no golden coral in the area for old people to goto"}
{"text":"I love the breakfast. I went with my wife on a Sunday morning and we sat in the back against the wall. At the end of our meal my wife looked behind her shoulder and the old wallpaper was  completely covered in grease and black filth along with a disgusting black hair. We are both so grossed out. Will never go back. I wonder how clean the kitchen is.  Totally grossed out."}
{"text":"I grew up going to Gene's, and now I'm finally old enough to say that I'm not terribly crazy about it.  It has some nice features -- I can always rely on them for pancakes and other breakfast food, and for some reason I recall having a fondness for their chili as a child -- but it's pretty average, and has a lot of unhealthy options on their menu.

Yes, the piano player is charming, as is the decor.  I think I've just been going there too long to appreciate its novelty anymore."}
{"text":"We had been to Gene's for burgers awhile back.  They were very good.  This visit was for dinner on a Friday night.  There were 4 of us.  We were so extremely disappointed.  Between all of us, we had the cod special, honey fried chicken, and chicken breast dinners.  We will not be going back.  While the cod tasted fine, it was not what we expected when having dinner out.  Fries were...bland, and we had carrots as a veggie.  The carrots were actually the best thing.  Salad came with dinner, it was average, nothing to write home about.  The tartar sauce was mostly mayo.  We had 3 dinners come out, the 4th dinner was out about 7 or 8 minutes later.  The honey chicken was weird, the leg and wing was so tiny, it did not belong with the chicken.  Mashed potatoes were  bland, did not taste real.  The boneless chicken breast was dry, no sauce was provided for dipping.  
All in all I was embarrassed to have chosen this restaurant to take my brother and sister-in-law to.  Lesson learned.  Gene's has the option to be a very nice place to dine, it is plenty large enough.  Menu needs updated, tables need cloths.  Use glass for drinks, and not pizza type of plastic ware. Prices were high for the low end food we had."}
{"text":"Great place to eat.  Clearly the place is not a five star restaurant, but given the food they offer, the place is good, and the price is reasonable. My favorite is the pierogi, or  the dr zhivago.  Overall, genes place is on my top 10 of regularly frequented restaurants."}
{"text":"Favorite for breakfast in Cleveland. Great food and service with a terrific atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I love Gene's Place. We lived in Cleveland for 5 years and this was a regular spot for us. We stopped in on a recent trip and had an excellent breakfast! They still have good prices. Highly recommend the potato pancakes.  You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Spechlessss!!! Best diner ive ever been!!! Coffee is great, food is awsome, great service.I feel like im in the 30's in hollywood dinners.."}
{"text":"This place was just okay. Freezer \"fried chicken\" and rubbery eggs are not exactly elements of dining we seek out. Service was okay. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Long wait on Sunday morning with plenty of tables open.  The hostess was in no hurry to get everyone seated.  A little expensive, $9.50 for a two egg omelet with chopped up sausage links and three pancakes.  The pancakes were good and breakfast came fast.  Husband ordered a Danish and it was just a standard frozen Danish you can get any where.  Been there done that, aint goin back!"}
{"text":"Walked in at 12:50, they said no more names past 1pm. Their clock is a little off. They close at 2pm. Guess they didn't want our business, so we walked across the street and had a great brunch."}
{"text":"This place is the best!  Great food at reasonable prices.  Loved the quaint ambiance.  The live piano music was wonderful, very relaxing.  The staff was friendly, polite and professional.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Have dined here multiple times. Always great food and great fast service.
Extensive menu. 
I had a great streak,  done just right.
Pricing is good!
Parking is easy.
Fast, friendly service.
A great LOCAL non-chain place in Cleveland West Park area Kamm 's Corner."}
{"text":"Great company and great food! I finished the entire plate of food, highly recommend the pancakes, they are the best around!"}
{"text":"There is no better neighborhood spot in the Kamms / West Park area. Great for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Friendly service and an awesome atmosphere. Not to mention I've never had a meal there I didn't like. 

(Their potato soup is to die for)"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat in Cleveland! Never a wait (ok sometimes on Sunday morning) very affordable prices, the nicest staff in the world, and tons of variety! They serve breakfast all day which rules because they have the best pancakes in the city. Everything is homemade and you can tell. Easily the best!!"}
{"text":"Genes is a great little diner in Kamms corner. Good food priced right. Never been disappointed! Awesome staff as well. They always have daily specials and great music playing. I love the old Hollywood memorabilia all through the diner. Give it a try I'm sure you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Met a friend here for breakfast.  We live pretty far apart, and Genes was convenient for both of us.  She had the corned beef hash which she said was very good, and I had the French toast which was also good.  Coffee refills were plenty, and we did not feel rushed, even though the restaurant was busy.  Plenty of breakfast options, good prices and lots of parking."}
{"text":"I absolutely love genes place and the people who work there. I have been coming here since probably the day I was born. I totally recommend going to genes you will not be disappointed. I cannot wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"The first word that comes to mind to describe Gene's is charming. The walls are plastered with black and white photos of old movie stars and various tchotchkes that you might find in your grandma's kitchen.  The food also reminds me of something my grandma might have prepared for me when I would get dropped off at her house on a snow day. I had a hearty soup and the slider special which hit the spot on a cold day. Service was friendly and the prices were fair. I will be back here when I'm in need of some nostalgia and comfort food."}
{"text":"So I'm guessing because I'm the Duchess here I should post a review. 

This place won a special place in my heart with curly fries at breakfast. Mmmm curly fries. The omelettes are tasty and cheesy. My personal favorite is the porky pig. Breakfast sausage and cheddar cheese bliss. If this were not enough you can also get some of their fluffy pancakes with your omelette if you don't want hash browns. We usually split the husband gets curly fries and I get pancakes and we share. The coffee is good hot and bottomless.  The bottomless coffee may have more to do with the servers who are always bright chipper and on top of their tables in a good way. 

Downside is this place often has a wait for breakfast. But it's well worth the 15 minute wait."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Gene's. Being a locally-owned, non-chain place is always a plus as far as I'm concerned. Also, our waitress was fast and efficient as well as being really welcoming and friendly. My husband had eggs and sausage with pancakes; I just had a small order of pancakes. People have said really good things about the pancakes here, but mine came to the table cold, thin and kind of limp. I tried a few bites of my husband's pancakes and they were great-warm, fluffy and cooked all the way through. WTF? 

What really made it unpleasant was the hostess. She was really abrasive and bitchy -- It was very noisy, plus my husband has a slight hearing impairment and misunderstood which name she had called. Instead of simply saying he was mistaken, she started yelling and mocking his inability to hear clearly.  Completely unprofessional and uncalled for. I would have left, but we ended up staying because we were hungry and had a long drive ahead of us."}
{"text":"Had a great Reuben here today. Gene's is -slightly- pricier than some other diners in the neighborhood, but it's worth it since there's rarely a wait and the staff are perpetually chipper!"}
{"text":"LOVED this place...Lori,  our server was fantastic!!! The portions are HUGE!   If I lived locally I would definitely be a regular!"}
{"text":"Gene's is a Kamms Corner landmark diner with well-prepared homestyle food and a 1940s ambiance. The menu isn't extensive, but has a nice selection of breakfast, lunch, and dinner items. The wait staff is cordial, friendly, and attentive.

The potato pancakes are terrific and are the highlight of their offerings.

Two slight critiques: they don't put either Equal or Splenda packets on the tables and their prices are a bit high for breakfast items. Otherwise, it's highly recommended for diner dining."}
{"text":"I like it!

I went there for my 29th Birthday and as a fan of Golden Age Celebrities...this place is a must! I hope to go there for my next Birthday and if there's a Taco/Burrito/Enchilada dish special...it should be called \"Three Caballeros\" after the Disney Movie with Donald Duck."}
{"text":"I enjoy this local spot for its breakfast menu and unique atmosphere. It's a place that is loved by senior citizens and you know what you're getting when it comes to the food.  Nothing fancy to rave about here, but sometimes, you just want pancakes and scrambled eggs and that's exactly what you get!  I've always had good service every time I've visited Gene's Place.  At my last visit, I had the vegetarian lasagna special and the Tuscan soup - both were delicious!  I can't wait to go back and have the soup again. It was the perfect blend of beans, rice, and veggies.  I'd try this place out if you're looking for traditional American fare, but want to avoid your local chains."}
{"text":"Great local place with a fun older atmosphere and a wide menu.  The crepes were great as was most of their breakfast menu. Dinner is great, love their sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Best pancakes in the city without question.  They have an awesome breakfast all around.  Great neighborhood place filled with real people.  Their burger is one of the most underrated burgers in C-town."}
{"text":"This is the best place for breakfast.  It's reasonably priced, generous servings, great service and they have the best pancakes."}
{"text":"I'm very fond of diners and local restaurants. I'm lucky to live near Gene's because they serve delicious food, their prices are reasonable and their service is excellent."}
{"text":"Nice place for breakfast with excellent service & a throwback to a great age of our time."}
{"text":"Been going to Genes for 25 years and have yet to be disappointed.  First the staff is attentive and cheerful.  Though I stick to the same couple of menu items, they are always great.

A warm and welcoming place with a lot of options and good people.  

Check it out for breakfast or lunch.  Haven't had dinner there, so can't speak to that."}
{"text":"I'd like this to reflect 4.5 stars! I have one word for you : PANCAKES. I'm serious when I say I don't think I have ever had better pancakes. Fluffy, thick, and crisp enough on the outside. Not soggy or floppy at ALL. I want them now. 

Everything else food wise is good, I had an omelet with sausage and american cheese. It was on par, but no more. It's a great diner/local place for breakfast! It's actually very big for a diner. The coffee was good and was kept filled. 

Service is good. People are friendly, you pay at the front counter which makes for a quick breakfast. 

Can't wait to have those pancakes again."}
{"text":"Their food is ALWAYS delicious and their crew is ALWAYS polite and friendly. I have always walked away from any meal there completely
satisfied also because the atmosphere is friendly and the walls are decorated with the pictures of movie stars of the golden age of the film industry. These people who gave Genes Place a negative review dont know what they are talking about. I have been going there for years and will continue to go there."}
{"text":"Had fond memories of going here as a kid with my family.
Retuned on a visit home as an adult and either my standards have changed or this place has gone downhill. Surly staff and gross food. I would avoid this place."}
{"text":"Hello Gene! This is my new favorite breakfast spot! I love everything about Gene's Place and I wish I would have visited sooner. I always drove by but never thought to stop and try the food.

The 40's and 50's memorabilia through out the restaurant is my favorite part, It's very nostalgic for customers of all ages. It reminds me of a diner in Las Vegas that would be open 24/7. They've been in business for 50 years so you can definitely say they got it right. I had and omelette and my boyfriend enjoyed the steak and eggs. The food was really good and so was the service. A great place to get together with longtime friends and family. :)"}
{"text":"A great family place with a friendly staff.  My children love coming here to visit \"the joke lady\" who always entertains them with a new joke every time we come in.  It has become a bit of a tradition.  There are some trendier breakfast places around with more of a menu selection, including healthier options but, nothing beats a family owned business that's been around forever.  Favorites on the menus are the AM Bagel, Skillet Breakfast or the Marx Brothers."}
{"text":"I have heard nothing but bad reviews from this place. Everything from the hostess was rude. To the waitresses didn't care and felt like the customer was bothersome. Also the food was very bad.  
So today I had to see for myself.  I couldn't believe a place could be that bad.  I ate breakfast here and I chose a very busy time 10am on a Sunday.  Well I will tell you that I had a five star time here.  The hostess was pleasant and smiled.  The waitress was friendly and quick to the table.  The kitchen staff got my order cooked to perfection. Even the busboy was friendly.  So is this a one off???   I hope not. Because this will be my new breakfast spot.  
I ordered the corned beef hash with one egg over easy and with pancakes. Cooked as it should be. Perfect."}
{"text":"Still 3 stars for me. Pancakes are still the star of the menu for me- always get the Jack Benny ( 2 eggs, 2 bacon, 2 pancakes $4.99)"}
{"text":"I LOVE Gene's Place!!! In Westpark there really aren't many great breakfast spots, so thank goodness for this place! Everything on the menu is exactly what you would expect from a great diner, the atmosphere has an awesome old school vibe, and the service is outstanding."}
{"text":"Give me my girls, a few bucks, and an evening to burn, and we'll spend a few hours here laughing and chowing down some good eats, downing more than a few mugs of coffee and listening to the pianist who comes in on weekends play showtunes (he has a particular affinity for The Sound of Music).

Give me a Frisco salad (served with a warm muffin rather than boring 'ol bread) some Texas noodles, and a homestyle apple dumpling for dessert, and my belly will be happy.

Give my not-quite-two-year-old niece Mya a cafeteria-style carton of milk and a straw, and she will no doubt spill it all over herself.  But she will feel better if you give her a bite of your peach muffin and a dollar so she can tip the nice piano player.

Good times, good prices, staff that knows you after the second time you come in, and a nice, chilled out place to hang with your friends and have a great, home-cooked meal."}
{"text":"I have to admit, I may be a bit biased; I've been going to Gene's before I could walk. 20 years later, it's still one of my favorite diners in Cleveland. For breakfast, you can't go wrong with a stack of their silver dollar pancakes. I'm partial to the Audrey Hepburn sandwich for lunchtime. It's turkey, cheddar, and bacon on sourdough. Relatively simple, I know, but so yummy. 

Most people remember Gene's for its decor. It's decked out with Golden Age of Hollywood memorabilia. I'm almost certain I have a conversation about Judy Garland every time I'm there. Gene's has great service and the staff is always super friendly. The diner is a staple in the West Park neighborhood, and I couldn't imagine Kamm's Corners without them. If you're in the 'hood, stop by!"}
{"text":"Really great portion sizes, affordable and good staff! The place is HUGE on the inside which you would not think from looking at it."}
{"text":"Affordable good place for breakfast with eclectic decor.  Can't comment on other meals as I've never been.  They keep the coffee coming but you do have to beg for the splenda- they dole it out like gold.  Must have a lot of people stealing it."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great atmosphere. If you're looking for a place to get a quick bite, this is by far the place to go. Breakfast, lunch or dinner you can't beat Gene's Place. It's a Cleveland and West Park staple, and a must try if you're in town."}
{"text":"'I can't believe I've never been here before' is what I said when I walked in. I'm still a little surprised. I've know some of the family for years and it's minutes from my house.

Nonetheless, my Dad and I stopped in one night after house hunting in the West Park area and I'm so glad we did!  I was pleased immediately by the décor. I love all the old movie posters, autographs, flashy golden age celebrity headshots and a warmth you can only get from a diner like Gene's. There was tons of space and Vince sat us immediately.

Our server was a little like a modern day Gracie Allen, but a sweetheart. I loved the clever menu- especially the prices!

Dad was happy with his salad and fried chicken. My reuben was a nice size and featured delicious corned beef. We can't wait to come back for breakfast!!

HIGHLY recommended!"}
{"text":"Waitress 22 is VERY aggressive. Today I was unable to enjoy my meal because her loud, angry yelling could be heard throughout the entire restaurant. Her poor employees- I would never work for such a horrible person! Geez. But my meal was delicious. Probably will just get it to go next time."}
{"text":"A couple of friends and I were hungover on a grey blustery Saturday looking for a breakfast/lunch place. There were lines at Grumpy's, Original Pancake House and First Watch. My friend suggested a place that his Grandma used to take him as a young'n. This was Gene's Place located in Kamm's Corners. Once I stepped inside I felt like I was whisked away to 1987 at an old Brown Derby. Most sandwiches are under $6. There are pictures of old celebrities and Hollywood stars adorning the walls. The service was a little slow. I did not care. One of my hothead friends did. I will return to this restaurant very soon."}
{"text":"This wonderful hole in the wall couldn't make you feel more welcomed. They have a classic movie and celebrity theme that carries through out. The wait staff is amazing and the food is quality home cooking. Burgers, frittatas, croissant sandwiches, meatloaf, you name it there is something on the menu for everyone. Prices, right where you would expect them to be. We enjoyed our breakfast/lunch and I look forward to going back some day soon."}
{"text":"I've been going to Gene's Place my entire life and I've never had anything but 5 Star service! Any time of the day you go there will always be great service and even better food. My personal favorite has to be the strawberry crepes with a side of home fries, but their lunch and dinner menu foods are just as great! Would definitely recommend this to other people as a great local restaurant in West Park."}
{"text":"This is just a great all around restaurant. Food was  good, coffee was good, atmosphere was great, and our server Lori was perfect!"}
{"text":"Breakfast all day! I've been here twice now and it is exactly what it looks like. It's a diner with cheap, good eats. If you want pancakes at 2pm, this is the place to go. If you are looking for fancy cooking techniques or exotic ingredients, you won't find them here. But if you want good eggs & pancakes or even a good sandwich - this place won't disappoint. The service is friendly and always asking what else they can get you. They keep the coffee flowing. I'm so glad I finally made my way in here, I just can't believe it took us so long!"}
{"text":"Well I can certainly see why this place is a local institution. I went there for the first time on Father's Day with my in laws, and I bet it was the only place in the city with no wait for Father's Day brunch, and such quick service.

All the waitresses were friendly and fast, and I loved the décor! So many fun things on the walls to look at, very homey. I got the skillet breakfast which was quite good (whatever bread they use for their toast is amazing, and I loved the hash). My husband got the pancakes, and I have to say they are the best pancakes I've ever eaten at a restaurant!!! I don't usually like sweet food for breakfast but I could have happily had an entire plate of those. 

Definably a cozy, family friendly place."}
{"text":"My first time here I was hesitant but it was pretty decent ! I like the old 50s decor was interesting to look at, the waitress was really nice too and was very knowledgable about items. My toddler enjoyed the spaghetti noodles"}
