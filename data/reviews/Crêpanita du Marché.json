{"text":"Delicious! I got the asparagus and ham and cheese crepe which I shared with my girlfriend who got a Nutella crepe!  They were both 5 star crepes!  Cute little outdoor seating shaded by a nice tree!  Perfect place for a brunch!  Thanks Crepanita"}
{"text":"Super service très grand choix de crêpes sucrées et salées. Bonne portion et bon rapport qualité /prix."}
{"text":"I give them one star because there is no lower rating. 
I don't know what's wrong with them. Not only did they make us pick up our beverages and crepes at the counter ourselves. The other patrons were already served, there were 3 staffers and only the 2 of us. What's up with that?
They added an additional charge of $1.80 for using a coupon!?"}
{"text":"There a few times in your life that you have a meal that you know you'll never forget and for me that happened today. I won't pretend it changed my life, but it's only been a few hours so who knows.  I ordered the jambon fromage and now I'm literally considering moving to Montreal. Bravo et merci!"}
{"text":"I discovered this great little place while walking around the village, and I'm so glad I stopped by for a bite.  The staff are super friendly, and the savoury crepes are delicious: thin and perfectly crispy with decadent fillings.  The fondante is my favourite.  I wish I had a bigger stomach so I could eat a second crepe, but the first one had me stuffed.  The nice little patio by a not-too-busy intersection is a great place to eat brunch or an early dinner and enjoy the sun.  I'll definitely be coming back to Montreal just to eat here."}
{"text":"Best Best Best!! + you get a salat;)
Forgot to take the picture it was so good!! Came with family, super friendly staff, small, local-worth of coming!! Great prices!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best creperies in Montreal - on par with the amazing Breizh Cafe on St Laurent. The buckwheat crepes are delicious! On top of that, I think the prices are reasonable. Only thing they are missing is some cider."}
{"text":"I think these are the best crêpes I have tried in Montreal, its a small yet cozy place and their owners will tell you all about the crêpes they prepare, they told us they make them just the way its made in Bretagne (they're French). We tried the Pecheur and the caramel and salty butter crêpe, they were delicious!"}
