{"text":"This place is one of the better sports bars in Vegas. Stayed at worldmark across the street and went to watch the Seahawks. Staff was the most friendly and accommodating. This has got to be the cleanest bar in Vegas. One guy was constantly cleaning which indicates this place is well managed. Food was outstanding and the tv monitors with all the games encircle the bar. A great experience. The only thing that scaled was the hawks lost"}
{"text":"Great spot. Was looking for something new around my area and decided to drop in and check this place out. The staff is awesome, the food unique and delicious, and the drinks are reasonably priced. Also the place still feels new and just has a good chilled atmosphere to it."}
{"text":"Our server lindsey made our visit awesome! Had a great time there! She recommended some great food.. the french dip and prime rib sandwich were delicious and definitely cannot forget about the mac n cheese with the carne asada and jalape√±os she recommended to us! All in all had a great time and will definitely be back and will recommend to all!"}
{"text":"One of the best all around bars in Vegas.   The food is fantastic. The bar staff at every shift is attentive, fun and effective.   Good beer and drink selection.   The gaming is very good too.   A rare find that has all the elements. Including a spacious parking lot!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's safe to say it's my favorite local bar. All of the staff is friendly and accommodating no matter what shift you go in on. I bring clients in when they are in town because I know this place will never disappoint. The food is off the chart."}
{"text":"For sure the best bar food in town, that is 100% true.  I visit often and the staff is always very nice, gaming is decent to.  Great location just off the strip, down the road from South Point."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best bars in town. Staff is always friendly and accommodating even when it's super busy. There's a great selection of rotating seasonal beers on tap so it's always fun to see what's coming next. Food is great and love the weekly Friday specials, especially the Ribs! I recommend checking this place out on any shift you'll be treated like family!"}
{"text":"Great place to meet up with friends for a few drinks. Food was good for bar food and nice cold drinks! There is a lot of sitting area, games to play and the servers are very nice."}
{"text":"Love this place food is always great never once had a bad meal here. I love playing keno here so many different games to choose from. BTW Liza makes the best bloody mary's in town she has a secret and won't give it up! All of the staff are super sweet and friendly. Especially Liza and El."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour-- drink specials were typical: rail drinks and domestic drafts. Ordered a bunch of appetizers for the table and all were delicious!! Animal style tots were the favorite, followed closely by the buffalo chicken dip; we also got some nachos, and an app sampler platter.  Friendly staff. :) The only thing that caught us off guard was that this place has no windows and it's extremely dark inside-- and that's fine, just not what we were anticipating! Still had a good time! As other reviewers said, it definitely is a little smokey inside, but we came at kind of a slow time, so it wasn't terrible."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Whole staff is super sweet! Great place to watch a game or even get some work done while eating some amazing food. Good job with the location right by my house  I'll always be a regular here"}
{"text":"Horrific service from hell, ripped off and charged for draft Bud Lights when I was gaming, snarky, rude regulars squeezing our space as a middle aged couple having a bite to eat..shameful is the word that comes to mind, it was a truly horrible experience."}
{"text":"Came here after work with some coworkers. Fun staff great food couldn't ask for anything more. Also another cool thing is a lot of industry folks were in here so the vibe was just right. Cheers!"}
{"text":"The kitchen is pretty much the best thing about the bar. They have a large menu with some of the best bar food I've ever had, not just here in Vegas but anywhere. 2 thumbs up to the kitchen staff and chef's. The bartenders are cool but most of the time overwhelmed. There is only one entrance in and out on las vegas blvd. so getting in and out can be a bit tricky and word to the wise, if you have been drinking don't leave the bar in a hurry... Since you're getting right onto las vegas blvd it is right out in the open for everyone (especially the police). The bartenders take extra special good care of the folks who gamble so if you want to make friends with the bartenders start gambling!"}
{"text":"Cigarette smoke, smoke, smoke and more smoke.   I had to go and get fresh air. Did not get a drink or eat ok just cigarette smoke and more smoke and more smoke"}
{"text":"The best food I've ever had at what's referred to as a bar. It's actually better food than most restaurants around. All the bartenders and staff are excellent!"}
{"text":"5 stars from the did. Courtney 5 stars. Food 5 stars. Service 5 stars. Other bartenders which I always forget their names 5 stars. Oh I just asked her name (again) Patrice 5 stars. I'm out."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is very laid back and not too to loud, you can have a decent conversation with your group. There are tv screens everywhere and the place was clean. I give 4 stars because they don't have much to choose from for vegetarian options but....... I do want to say that The Bar will go the extra mile to cater to you. Al, who is extremely professional and attentive went out of his way to have a special meal made for me, well basically the rice bowl plate but no chicken and instead had them sautee vegetables and avocado with teriyaki and buffalo sauce, it came out much better than I expected. I had ordered the garlic edadame but it was very salty and Al promptly removed it. Our micheladas and \"The Lily\"\"drink were amazing so props to the bartender!  Good times I'll be sure to come back."}
{"text":"Great if you just want a place to have beers, but nothing outwardly special or unique about the grub. Good service and friendly staff. Probably won't eat here again, but will for sure stop in for drinks."}
{"text":"Great food AND service !! Food really tasty too must try tater tots with crumbled bleu cheese omg good"}
{"text":"Great food and with 5 star service. The sign outside says best bar food and it really is! We are on vacation and have made it a point to come here."}
{"text":"Service is great!  A great place to watch the game.  The breakfast burrito is TO Die for and they have great salsa.  It smells really bad when your walk in... I don't know why.... But get used to it and enjoy the food!  It's so good!"}
{"text":"Tempura Asparagus is a Must here! -) Anything less would be uncivilized ,, just sayin,, love this place!!"}
{"text":"Adding truffle oil, to typical bar food with low quality ingredients does not  elevate food to gourmet quality. The apple has lost it shine already from the recently opened establishment. Service was less the adequate, however at least the bartender, did not require an explanation of neat.   I hope they can turn it around, but all the signs for failure are there."}
{"text":"I have been a regular customer for  the past four years, I always have been treated  differently  by the swing shift then the night shift. There is two particular servers that have mistreated me on several occasions and recently it  got so bad  that I've begun to feel like it may be a racist thing because I am hispanic. I finally got fed up with this, so I complained with management and she said she was going to address the situation. I made the big mistake of returning to the bar recently only to find out I was not welcome on their premises any longer. I wasn't  given any explanation why.  I  guess it was because I complained about the bartenders and the service I was receiving.  At the end of the day, they are only losing one customer and my money is not important to them. I will never go back to this establishment and I'd rather  spend my money elsewhere. Fortunately for me there are lots of other places to go."}
{"text":"they have an appetizer called \"the skins\"...omg, if u wanna chill have some drinks and love munchies that include potatoes afterwards, u have gone to the right place...and they also have healthy dishes, like a rice bowl with chicken asparagus and BROWN RICE, for all you ppl that watch your sugar"}
{"text":"Thank you to Johnny aka Turbo, and Juan for the 2am hospitality as I caught up on my sports. Y'all made the experience way better. I appreciated the different music and was able to hang out and have a good time. The food is amazing, and I had enough to pack away for breakfast tomorrow. It was the first time I was there, and it won't be the last. Thank you for everything I got a new song called legend by the score... never would have known if I didn't show up at 2am for food. Y'all are great! The water was a nice touch. Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place. It's so close to our house. We go for the food and our favorite waitress Spenser. She's the cutest thing!!   I haven't had one bad thing here. The buffalo chicken dip is absolutely to die for. And for a bar, the steak is phenomenal. I've probably had just about everything on the menu and can't complain a bit!"}
{"text":"We were staying across the street for the weekend and when I first saw this place I never expected it to be what it is! When you first walk in it is like a dark, cool dungeon. The guy working greeted us immediately and made some suggestions as far as food (we were starving and slightly buzzed). The food here is SO GOOD! We had to ring the bell to get in the first time we went (safety reasons I'm sure). We went again the next day (sober) for lunch and it was still just as good if not better than the night before! It's open 24 hours so you can go anytime. Everything about this place is five stars from me. The people working, the food, and the drinks were all awesome. I am definitely going to visit this place every time I'm in town. Highly recommend the breakfast sandwich!!"}
{"text":"I came really late after the club with a couple colleagues.  Had the chicken parmesan sandwich and it was phenomenal.  They use smaller chicken pieces instead of a big long breast making it unique and ooey, gooey and warm.  In crave this thing from time to time."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend were headed to another bar when we seen the sign outside say voted best bar food so we pulled in and decided to try it. The food is absolutely wonderful. Mac and cheese bites were amazing but the real reason to visit this place is the service. The Tuesday night crew was helpful with everything and very attentive. No drink ever went empty and when we asked for for a side of ranch and extra jalape√±os they were I front of us within a minute. Best service we have had in Vegas do not miss out on this place."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place but due to the fact I have been charged 3 different prices for the same wine I am over it. If you serve 3 kinds of the same wine at different prices but aren't going to pour the same wine from one glass to the next tell your customer. They have me paying for an upgrade wine that is actually a downgrade. I am still getting happy hour price so its hard to be mad but when I ask for a menu and no one comes to take my order before I've finished my drink you just lost my business. Steiners is just down the street and the food is just as good if not better. I have been here before. Service matters. There just doesn't seem to be much here."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town, went there alone and the staff was really friendly, social and welcoming of out of towners!! They provided a recommendation for the Philly cheesesteak and it was awesome!"}
{"text":"Occasionally I stay at the wyndym hotel chain that's next door. When I do I come over to the bar and grab some food cause this place knows what they're doing when it comes to food. I've had the burgers and salads, both of which are awesome. The bartenders do a good job of keeping it moving and managing the drinkers. I like this bar a lot. I'm not crazy about the seating and layout, but I'll keep coming for sure."}
{"text":"Great grub, great drinks, and great servers.  Came here  on a recommendation from a friend and I'm glad I did.  Ordered the cobb salad and my friend ordered the fish tacos.  The cobb salad was huge and couldn't finish it all.  My friend said the fish tacos were awesome.  They have a variety of drinks.  I tried a cocktail made with gin, cucumbers, and elderberry.   It was so good that I had a second.  They have a decent happy hour next time I'll have to try."}
{"text":"Great bar with some pretty good food. Their breakfast sandwiches are delicious though super unhealthy :-) the only thing I wish they had were pool tables!"}
{"text":"Great bar ,  great food.. a million TVs .. hot bartenders.. what else could you ask for? They have free games like shuffle board which is a cool game to play drunk. Stop in and you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Customer service was amazing! We're visiting from Oregon and loved the buffalo chicken dip! It's a must have!!! And they have quality IPAs, always a plus!"}
{"text":"Went in and ordered a drink and then was ignored for 20 minutes!   Couldn't even get their attention to pay our tab!    2 bartenders and 2 bar backs working!    I will never go back!"}
{"text":"Word to the wise, don't visit this bar if the parking lot is packed. If the parking lot is packed then the bar and restaurant are going to be packed and you're gonna get some shitty service since their never prepared for a lot of customers. On the other hand, if there are less then 15 to 20 cars in the parking lot then you're good to go! You will get good service, the food will be good and you will be happy. I've tried to break this rule before since I've been here a dozen times and it never fails. I've ordered the cheeseburger which is standard, the pretzel that was cold, the etimame - delicious. The wings were great so it's all hit and miss and what you're into. All my friends love this bar and love the food here as well so I will continue going - but not when it's busy! That's where I draw the line damnit!"}
{"text":"This was my second time at this bar and i Really love it!! The first time i went with a friend was just for drinks which are amazing. I recently went back last Thursday and tried some food i had the hawaiian bbq chicken fingers w/sweet potato fries. OMG thoes sweet potatoe fries with the side of honey idk who came up with that concept but hats off to you. Also they were crispy and seasoned just right. The chicken fingers are moist and flavored nicely and a good size.  The bartenders are amazing and very social!!  Lisa i think that's her name is the best and she makes a shot that taste JUST LIKE a drink you would get from Sonic.  The ambiance is low lighting quiet both times i went there but im sure it gets loud like every other bar. Great place to watch the sports. Great place all around consider me a regular! :)"}
{"text":"The food is good but the service sucked today!! Took very long to place order, not attentive, ignored by bartender! Will never go back!!  We have given this place several chances!!"}
{"text":"ALWAYS the best bar food I've ever had, with the friendliest staff you could want. We are locals that have lived here over 30 years and I love this local bar. They even make sure the moment you leave, your area it's completely sanitized by the bar staff. So clean!"}
{"text":"The bar...I like the location because it's down the street from my house. The lay out of the bar is very nice, but the staff is terrible. The girls are phony and have extremely crude attitudes. Their attitudes are offensive, your working in the hospitality industry and you are not friendly? Why? They all look like they hate their jobs. Your working for tips why not be happy, positive, and welcoming towards your guests. I've been here so many times and time after time it's the same bartenders and same bad service. The only friendly staff members are the bar backs. Also, my drinks were made by this women with brown curly long hair and all you could taste was the juice(grape fruit and vodka) for 1 drink and the other was just ginger beer(Moscow mule). The operation and training of this bar needs to change. The only thing good about this place is their food. The food is great! Good job cooks!"}
{"text":"Greatest bar food and the bartenders are the best. Very friendly staff who treats you like a friend and NOT a customer. Lindsey, Courtney, Stephanie & Patrice are so good at their jobs and even better at interacting with patrons. Definitely a great locals bar to go to. The second someone gets up from a machine, someone is there sanitizing the area for the next to play. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!! It just opened and it's awesome. The owners are super friendly, food is great, service is impeccable... Definitely me and my friend's go to bar in Vegas from now on. Even though that the bar is busy everyone takes time to talk to you. The atmosphere is pretty great too... Super chill and comfortable. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Just love coming here. 16 TVs around the bar and more on the walls!! Best for sports watching. Your favorite sport isn't playing...that's okay...great food and drinks and service!!! I love how there is half the for people that want to gamble and the other half for those that don't!!! Perfect. Get to The Bar on Las Vegas Blvd and Wigwam. Ask for the Lindsey (blonde bartender) or Stephanie (brunette bartender) these two are a match made in heaven just to serve you"}
{"text":"Would have given five stars if they didn't have smoking AND food. It's kind of gross to try to eat while the person next to you is blowing smoke all over your plate.   Really friendly staff and a diverse menu of food and cocktails. I live in the neighborhood and was hoping to make this a regular thing, but the smoking would probably prohibit me from eating there again."}
{"text":"I live across town but this is one bar I would drive to the other side to have a drink at. Courtney was my bartender that night and it was Thanksgiving she made me feel like I was family. It's a very popular bar, everyone makes you feel like you are a part of the conversation. Courtney is great and def made me feel welcome. Being a bartender on the strip I will def come back to visit Courtney very often."}
{"text":"Cheap drinks, great food (shrimp tacos), excellent service, great atmosphere and of course, shuffleboard."}
{"text":"The other day I decided to go enjoy a drink at my favorite local spot... Only to be told that \"the bar is closed and that, that is the only explanation\"... I'm starting to wonder what the goal of business is?  Business X accepts $ for producing Y--- If X tells customer A his $ is no longer acceptable-- Is it still a business??? Maybe X only accepts Rupees or Yen or Dinars?!   Either way I missed the course that allows the math on that to equal a well run company."}
{"text":"Great new place in the area. Bartenders are all friendly and fun. Absolutely loooove the Prime Rib Sandwich!!! The mozzarella bites are great, and the Angry Edamame is awesome as well. Best bar food in the area. This has become our new regular spot to go enjoy some drinks after work or catch a bite and some cocktails on the weekend."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot on the south side of Vegas. The bartenders and waitresses are very personable and friendly. The food is always good. Every time I walk into the bar I'm treated like a friend."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Sat at the bar and waited for so long for drink refills while the staff chatted with each other over what plans they had when they got off...... No tip"}
{"text":"No happy hour... So far regarding food: chicken wings were very low quality, not a good taste at all; and the Totchos were pretty disgusting; ok if you like a bowl of grease and cheese/sour cream to hide the lack of flavor. Good for a quick beer, not much else. Bartenders are nice though."}
{"text":"I love all their locations... The atmosphere and the employees are just great... But, what is even better is the Food... I live in LA and get to Vegas about twice a month on Business... I have to stop at the Bar every time I come... I was a little pissed at myself this last time only because I got caught in Rush Hour traffic going home... Got to go when I am coming in or while I am there... However, The Prime Rib dip was worth the extra 90 minutes on the road... Open More Locations... Better yet open one in Beverly Hills or Hollywood"}
{"text":"Probably the best bar in the area, fantastic food and ice cold drinks, all the bar staff are great and remember your name and drink...Adam on grave , Lisa on days are just a few to name.....the Bar is my favorite local places..great job guys"}
{"text":"Love Vegas. You have to search for the right places to eat if you are looking for a good price and portion."}
{"text":"This is a pretty relaxing place to come and have a beer and some food.  I got a burger and some fries which was really good.  They have video game machines and some table games.  It's a spacious place and all the times I have been in it hasn't been too busy.  The bathroom is clean.  There is lots of parking. The staff is excellent."}
{"text":"Went to check it out one night with the hubby and a  couple of our friends. We like The Bar at St. Rose so we thought it would be comparable.  Sat down and ordered drinks and asked for a menu. Decided on our food, placed the menus back on the bar but never got our food ordered until we were finished with round one of drinks. Placed our food order and round two of our drinks. We finished our food before we were even offered another drink or approached about service.   This would be understandable if there were more than 15 people in the bar and there weren't 't two bartenders. We weren't gaming so I guess we didn't count. I would walk past this Bar to get to any others."}
{"text":"Good food I like this place but if you are in the section that has games you probably won't have anyone ask if you want a drink. If you do get drinks and a menu you probably won't have anyone come back and take your order. Anywhere else in The Bar is fine just note this one spot. However the food is awesome just look at the pictures :)"}
{"text":"The food is hit or miss, the service is good but the real deal killer at this establishment is the cigarette smoke, just awful. I recommend unless you're a smoker, stay away from this place."}
{"text":"So glad we came in here to eat. We stopped by for lunch which was just a cross the street from our timeshare.  We were craving some burgers and MAN this place came through. It is super dark on the inside but still a very cool place. It had personality. I ordered a burger with bacon guac and mushrooms.  Soooooo good! Super juicy and the bun was amazing too. The fries and Caesar salad weren't great but still decent. We were in gluttony heaven. And for dessert we had a shot of Jim beam fire. Lol"}
{"text":"Love the food here, the machines seem to pay out more often than any of my other local haunts, the ambience is probably the best you'll experience, and whoever does the staff hiring knows what they're doing(one word- Angela). Courtney is great and knows how to treat locals, as does the rest of the team."}
{"text":"This is a nice place, I remember the old gee bee's and this is way better - also way more expensive....  I remember a shot of vodka and blue moon was 6.50 total and sometimes comped since they were badass bartenders but that's also the reason they probably  closed....  any who this the \"new bar\" is a ok if you're willing to pay 10.50 for a blue moon and a shot of vodka =)"}
{"text":"We wanted to try a new spot. After looking on Yelp and seeing the 4 star average, we decided to come here for some libations. I order my usual mimosa with a shot of peach Ciroc and my bf orders his shot of Tito's vodka and Michelob Ultra. They had a pretty decent food menu with lots of choices other than burgers and pizza. We also ordered a Cuban sandwich with a side salad. Since we were playing slots, our drinks were comped and we only paid for food. Kristina and Stephanie were super sweet and made sure we were properly hydrated and fed. Here's the reason for the 3 stars. My bf put in $60 into the machine and lost it within 10 minutes. Super tight, loosen it up a bit. And holy cow it was really smoky. We were enjoying our time but had to cut it short due to the smokiness of the bar. I hate leaving a place and smelling like an ash tray. I had a good time but I don't think I'll be back due to the smoke."}
{"text":"The Bar is one of my Vegas must dos. Edamame appetizer is just yum to the 100th power, the seasonings and the taste of soy sauce is uniquely  memorable.  Don't leave without trying the Buffalo Chicken Cheese Dip ...OMGSHHH! Loose slots video poker. The staff is so friendly and accommodating.  BTW EVERY BEER IS THE COLDEST ONE IN TOWN. You can't lose if you go to The Bar... they even serve an awesome breakfast."}
{"text":"Every time we come and stay at the Worldmark by Wyndham on the strip we always run across the street to this place. It used to be known as gee bees and it was kind of a dive but they took it and made it really nice lots of TVs you can see the TV from anywhere you sit , they have gaming and the food and the drinks are excellent. It's a step up from your regular bar food but still along those lines deep fried asparagus deep fried mac and cheese lots of salads and sandwiches and they were all excellent choices...tater tots with blue cheese, sweet potato fries or regular fries as a choice with all of your sandwiches and the prices are very reasonable for drinks and food especially for Vegas. We've had the same server both times we've gone this year and he's very pleasant and funny and accommodating.. Perfect, Clean, modern local spot still close to all the action but away on the Strip by itself go give it a try!!"}
{"text":"This gem is located right across from where I stay in Vegas from time to time (worldmark).   It's a bar but they have excellent food.   Been there a couple times now: breakfast lunch etc and has not disappointed."}
{"text":"The Bar gets the job done as far as I'm concerned.  Clean establishment, friendly staff, yummy mixed drinks, lots of TVs, music, a smoke free section, wide selection of food that is cooked to order, and good prices.  I went with a friend at 4:30pm on a Friday and when we left an hour later, the crowds were starting to pile in. I could see this place getting very tight during any sporting event that is televised.  We ordered a few specialty drinks, an order of tater tots(so crunchy), and pretzel bites for a total of 30$."}
{"text":"Disappointed.  Asked if I was gambling and if not, needed to move.  I had to wait 5 minutes to even get greeted.  The brunette waitress was a worker!  Wish I had her as my server.  The blonde wasn't even kind at all.  The bodybuilder steak was chewy and the eggs were watery.  I won't return.  It did have a decent atmosphere.  Maybe I came in at the wrong time.  I'm a strong tipper but just gave 20% for their effort.  SMH"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. The food is always great and the staff is always friendly! They actually make an effort to get to know you, unlike some bars that just hand you a drink and disappear. That's probably why it seems like they have so many regulars. This place is also the perfect place to watch games. There are TVs everywhere!"}
{"text":"Great customer service easy-going atmosphere the Bbq burger was amazing waffle fries were awesome too!.... Definitely check this place out!.... They even had an apple lighting for my phone when it died!...."}
{"text":"great bar to go to at great prices. This bar used to be a total dive but it was newly renovated by the bar and since then and has become a really nice place to go although the prices were renovated as well. If you're looking to save money this isn't the place for you, but if you're looking to have a really fun night and be out with kind of a swanky crowd stop by."}
{"text":"My experience here has been hit or miss.  About a month ago I was here and the service we received from the bartender was fantastic, food was great, and I won money!  This time the food was still great - always recommend the buffalo chicken dip, however the service was sub-par.  To start off, I'm in the service industry.  Beverage management to be specific.  My bartenders have to card people, I get it.  However this bartender says \"Can I see your IDS.. So I can cover my ass..?\"  A little unnecessary.  She was not very attentive and our drinks went empty multiple times.  In passing I told her I wanted to order again from her bc she was speeding by and I actually wanted to order something else however she assumed we wanted the same drink we'd been drinking so we just took it.  Throughout the evening the bartenders were taking shots with the other guests around the corner and were unprofessional to say the least.  Not sure that I'll be back to this location, however if you want great bar food I would give it a try!"}
{"text":"Great alcohol selection. The buffalo chicken cheese dip is amazing! One of my favorite sports bars in town."}
{"text":"Place is great. Food is amazing and the whole experience fantastic. Why go to a big casino when you can go to \"THE BAR\" where everyone knows your name.  The best experience in town."}
{"text":"Good bar service and cold beer, think I found my new goto hangout!! Adam and Patrice are attentive to the needs of customers. All good!"}
{"text":"Right across from my office.  Hella dark in here.  I guess average looks will be super duper in this dark lit place   music is great.  Food is Damn good.  Breakfast lunch or dinner.  Waitresses are adorable   service is very quick.  Tv's are everywhere.  You'll love it"}
{"text":"One of my favorite bars in town. Lots of gaming, cozy booths, tvs, and shuffle board. The staff is always warm and welcoming. Drinks always come out quickly and the food here is amazing. I try to have something different off the menu every time I come in and I'm never disappointed. The French dip is one of my favorites but honestly anything you order is going to be great."}
{"text":"Clean interior, great selection of food and alcohol. Open 24/7 so we'll definitely be coming here again."}
{"text":"The Bar is bomb service is great food is great and the chicks are hot as PUCK I love this place"}
{"text":"The Bar is my favorite spot in the city. Courtney and her staff are the best in town, and the food and cocktails are spot on. I love jackjacktm and fernet"}
{"text":"I want to say thank you to Adam the bartender for providing quick and personalized service. The Bar is one of the best I've been to. I wouldn't think that this bar would be awesome considering its location. The music was great and the food was delicious. I will definitely come back more often."}
{"text":"The food is so amazing! Goat cheese on my salad?! Just put it in my mouth.   They have great sandwiches, salads, and the bar is nice and dark without being creepy.   I give them 4 stars because the service isn't 100%. It's not as fast as I prefer (I find myself waiting for my next drink often) and that may be due to the bartenders socializing with their friends/regulars a little too much. Either way, they're generally pretty friendly, efficient and you'll never have a bad experience here."}
{"text":"A welcome and refreshing new bar,you walk in and you do not smell anything like smoke or unpleasant food smells.....  The bartender`s are super friendly and HOT [Even the guys...no gay] I usually see Steph, Patrice and Lindsey, anyway you are treated like your family here and it is honest not like some places that act like they care but truly a welcomed change.  For a Bar the Food is outstanding a fresh change from the greasy bar food of others in the area and there is one right down the street...Everything is fresh and Hot and just amazing..you have to have there deserts also there the bomb  The Gaming is awesome also, I do not win all the time but at least I can play longer and yes I do hit on a regular basis  This is my new local Bar ..."}
{"text":"This was my regular hang out until the service went sour. I hadn't been there in a year. On a whim, we decided to order their burgers for lunch. My co-worker and I both got ill with bad stomach aches and diarrhea that lasted throughout the night. No bullshit. My stomach is still turning over as I write this. Also, the burgers weren't made the way we ordered them. One of the burgers had nothing on it. Literally, it had nothing on it. It was meat and bun. We ordered it with cheese, grilled onions and lettuce. They didn't even include lettuce, tomato and onion in the box. We ordered them medium-well, but came well done and dry as wood. Tater tots and waffle fries were not fresh. The whole thing fuckin sucked and we got sick. I remember this place being good, but having two bad back-to-back experiences one year apart tells me something is foul. I'll never walk through those doors ever again."}
{"text":"Came here after a long grave shift, Liza was super helpful and accommodating, will show up here again for sure"}
{"text":"Good food, friendly staff, nice atmosphere. It's in the middle of nowhere which coincidentally happened to be right across the street from the resort I was staying at.  I got their Meatloaf, which was good but nothing to be amazed at. I tried a bit of my friend's cream soup though and that was delicious.  Other than that my only complaint is that getting the bill and paying it took way longer than it should have. There was only one waiter on the floor and he stopped for a while to chat with someone by the bar, and even after we got the bill it took him forever to come back so we could pay."}
{"text":"This bar sucks. Wow I was so excited anout this place. Adam and most of the bartenders are literally a 4 out of 10. Even tipping ten bucks a drink there slow. I was so excited about this place and needless to say this place is a joke. PTs much better service. What a joke  to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"So I'm not really a bar person but I have been here quite a few times and absolutely LOVE it! Patrice and Courtney are the best! Great service and great food!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out after reading decent reviews. The first thing you notice is all the cigarette smoke. Service was good but food was very mediocre. My pastrami sandwich was dry and not a lot of pastrami. Wife's Rueben was ok but served with cold meat. Her cocktail was lacking liquor. Place was crowded with the local hockey team in the playoffs. Fun atmosphere, poor food."}
{"text":"The bar is a great place that is away from the strip in LV and you do not get the lines that one gets on the strip. The customer service is usually good and the atmosphere is very relaxing with TVs all around. Ordered a burger with bacon and was better than decent. One can gamble and drink with little hassle and not much noise . Most of the crowd are locals"}
{"text":"Always the best bar to come to! Always make you feel @ home & they always look out for you! Thanks James Wickman!"}
{"text":"This is a cool bar. Casual and friendly, it is an all people place. Spenser rocks, so hopefully you are there when she is working. I accidentally deleted the photos of my food but that philly cheese steak was KILLER. I got it with add on mushrooms and peppers but the add on, although non-traditional was worth it because the price is already so reasonable. They have good healthy options (I took home the bowl. Diced chicken, asparagus and brown  rice. Be sure to ask for sauce on the side (I got teriyaki) or it will be a bit dry. Overall, my money was well spent."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic. The Mac n cheese and the Mac n cheese bites are great. Bar service sucks. When I have to flag down a bartender after being empty for 5 mins., that's a problem. And it's every time!"}
{"text":"The Bar is a pretty interesting place. The service is usually pretty good. My first two times here they got my order wrong. The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything to write home about. My last two trips saw a huge improvement. I had the mushroom Swiss burger and it was pretty good. They buy preformed frozen patties, so this isn't any beef worth writing home about. The mushroomed were saut√©ed well and the bun was fresh and squishy.  The service can really vary. I've noticed when we go with a moderate to large group the orders will be messed up pretty regularly. Incorrect food and drink will often appear at our tables. When we have 6 or less people they do a better job. The staff is very friendly and they are good people who often have a great story to share.  If you are looking for a place to grab food and drink give them a try."}
{"text":"Food drink and people are awesome to mingle with the local good people I go at least once a week. Lunch or early dinner"}
{"text":"This place is ok. Food is pretty good. The service is a bit sub par but eventually, after they greet the ones they like. Smiles were rare. I don't need service with a smile if it's quick and attentive. Oh well. It isn't terrible but it certainly isn't outstanding."}
{"text":"Carlos rocks!! And the prime rib sand is amazing!! And holy $#$# you can smoke in here!"}
{"text":"Food is always amazing!! Bartenders are friendly! Juan is the best!!! Great machines!! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Another boring, tired, uninspired location of ThE Bar. RePetes down the street has much better food and looser machines IMO."}
{"text":"I like the beer, and the drinks. The turkey club and tots were hot trash. I wish I didn't get takeout or I'd get my money back"}
{"text":"We stayed across the street and ate there 3 out of 4 days. The servers were so friendly. The food was AMAZING! And everything reasonably priced. Everything about it was great. I will eat there every time I come back :).. And they also sold hats and t-shirts that went towards breast cancer foundation.. Susan G. :)"}
{"text":"Nice local bar, good food, decent music and average video poker."}
{"text":"I'm giving 3 stars because it took 10+ minutes for someone to greet me when I came in and sat down. Staff was walking by me without acknowledging me or letting me know it would be a minute for a server. Once she did come over it was slow service. Not sure if this is a management issue because it seemed to be pretty busy with low staffing levels. Other than that, the food is good. I like their salads and carne asada."}
{"text":"The Bar has really grown on me and is now one of my favorite local spots! Located right on the corner of Las Vegas Blvd and Wigwam. The Bar is a solid bar for gaming, drinks, and food.   Food: - The buffalo chicken dip is life. Ask anyone who's tried it. A piping hot generous portion of Buffalo Dip (filled with cheesy deliciousness, hot sauce, and diced chicken breast) served with tortilla chips. I'm pretty sure I order this every time I go - Buffalo Chicken Wrap; Very tasty, filled with veggies and ranch/buffalo sauce. Comes with tater tots or fries. Both are bomb but I love the tots Usually stick to drinks and dip if I'm here but there has been a few times where I've been starving and got this wrap   Drinks: - Blue Moons are my go to beer - always go for the bigger size! - Pretty standard selection of beers, liquors, and wine... Never had a disappointing experience with their drinks   Gaming: - Trying to cut back on my degenerate habits but if you like video poker, keno, black jack, etc. the machines here are great. Video Poker sucks me in every time. I've won a few 4 of a kinds with and one of my girlfriends hit a royal the other night!   Ambiance: - Dimly lit, average sized bar. Bar seating around the main rectangular bar and plenty of booth and table seating - My previous review mentioned it was smokey. Still kinda is (to be expected anywhere smoking is allowed) but not as bad as I recalled my first few times visiting when they originally opened over 2 years ago   Service: - The bartenders here are SO nice and attentive! It's difficult to come across a bar where the service is consistently way above average. There's a tall female bartender with long dark hair that's always smiling and super sweet. There's a ton of regulars who come here and I'm sure the service here is a huge part of the reasoning!   Oh and there's shuffle board in the back. I'm terrible at this game but it's always fun to play with good company. Love The Bar!"}
{"text":"I have been waiting for a while for The Bar to open up and was happy with the final product. I sat at the bar and they had fast service great atmosphere (Thursday Night football was on). There is an abundance of HD TVs to watch sports on when I want to get out of the house. Very clean, approachable gaming bar, that makes you feel comfortable and welcome when you come in. The reason for the 4 stars and not full 5 was a mix up with my food order. The manager of the establishment came over and made sure that the problem was taken care of and made me want to return even though my first experience was not perfect."}
{"text":"We visited The Bar for the first time on July 3. We had just arrived in Las Vegas for the July 4th weekend.  We were tired and it was late night. We drove down Las Vegas Blvd. and everything was closed except for a few fast food restaurants.  Not wanting fast food we kept driving and spotted the Bar was open!  Well to our surprise the place was not what we expected. The dinning area was warm and inviting with very comfortable booths. The food was exceptionally good and everything on the menu look appetizing.  Well after we got home from Las Vegas a week later my girl friend realized she had left her prescription glasses at the Bar. I contacted the Bar and describe the eye glasses and to my surprise they were still there.  The manager was nice enough to return the glasses to us in California.  That is what I call real hospitality!"}
{"text":"When I am in Las Vegas I love to go to the bar and by the bar I mean The Bar!  If you want your business to be easy to find on Yelp or Google you might not want to name it The Bar.  Just sayin'   From the outside it looks kind of corporate or industrial, not too inviting but with nine foot letters that say BAR there is no mistaking what it is.    Inside is a different experience altogether, a great atmosphere, a lively crowd and some really amazing and engaging bartenders and staff!    I absolutely love Lindsay and Spencer.  I met them the first night of my recent visit to LV and after one brief meeting they remembered my name the rest of my stay.   Lindsay is the kind of bartender that when you say you want to settle up she flat out says \"No!\"  You smile, take it as a compliment and order another drink. (then quietly pay your tab and sneak out when she isn't looking)   The food is really very good.  One time I tried the tomato soup and grilled cheese the other I had a chicken tender appetizer.     One morning I was heading to breakfast and when I looked up the restaurant I realized that it opened at 8am, it was 7:15.  No problem, The Bar is open 24/7 so I popped in, visited my favorite bartender (end of her shift) and ordered a Bloody Mary...Just the right spice... oh, and the drink, it too had the right amount of spice."}
{"text":"The food is cheap and delicious here!! To add to that greatness, the staff is wonderful and the atmosphere is calming and fun!!! They even have TVs all over the place so you can enjoy football while you eat!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent here.  My tots were cooked to perfection.  The price is reasonable.  Only downside is the amount of smoke.  Our car smelled like a rental for a few days just from our clothing absorbing the smoke.  One more thing, our friend hit a 800 and 1000 plus video poker jackpot while we were sitting there."}
{"text":"This place kicks the balls harder than Cristano Ronaldo... Omg have u ever had pot roast before cuz it's too legit to quit here!!!! I've won money here, so I like that."}
{"text":"Omg. The food here is some of the best bar food in town. I'm particularly fond of the prime rib sandwich. All the bar tenders and Bar backs are friendly and engaging. Absolutely one of my favorite local bars. Ask about AuJusmame sauce. Haha"}
{"text":"Wow! As a long time Gee Bees fan (the dive bar prior to \"The Bar\" remodeling it). is amazing! The Jalapeno burger is one of the top 10 burgers I have ever had! The cook the Jalapenos are cooked into the meat! It comes with mushrooms, American and Pepper jack cheese, guacamole and 100 island dressing. The bread is amazing! It's so good!!! Even the fries are good and they offer tater tots.  My G/F ate a very tasty  French dip which I tried. Very good as well. The service is really good and always on point. They also have a shuffle board that is free, it's so much fun. The last thing I'll say is that you must have the DEEP FRIED peanut butter and jelly sandwich. It was amazing! Also comes with Ice cream and whipped cream."}
{"text":"Lindsay and Spencer told my friend he was a sparky and jerk...  I knew they were constant professionals at this point!  They let me charge my phone and treated me like a friend even though I don't know them....a+"}
{"text":"This is the perfect bar. Just perfect. Superb bartenders and the food is as good as it gets.   Good WiFi.  Specialty drinks are smart and sophisticated, as is the decor.  Perfect. Thank you for maintaining high standards for Las Vegas."}
{"text":"It's ok. Food is good, but the help is not real friendly nor do they pay attention to the whole bar."}
{"text":"Very good service, decent happy hour (wish they'd add food specials too) and good, if just slightly overpriced food.. Will likely return for the \"Totchos\" and friendly staff"}
{"text":"As far as sports bars go, this is a good one. You can watch games, they have many many tvs to choose from with various games on. You also can do some video gambling. The bar beverages seemed plentiful. I don't drink alcohol so it didn't hold my attention.   The food is ... on point. We had an experience of good, better, best with our food choices. The fried mac was good. The burger I built was better. The cheesesteak my pal has was best!! I'd be back for that dish alone. That being said, I was not mad about my burger. Try the pretzel bun. It was the correct choice!!  The service is a little slow and disorganized. But really, most people don't go to a bar for fast food service."}
{"text":"Good comfort food, loved the shuffle board and bar vibe. Super nice staff! Would definitely go back next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Food was good enough but smell of smoke was too strong. Wouldn't go back. Always liked their other location."}
{"text":"Pretty cool bar. Only have video poker machines at half the seats at the bar, which is nice. They have a shuffle board too. And probably the best burger I've ever had a bar. I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Don't let the outside stop you from enjoying this place. Good interior setup with lots of TV'S with booths if your coming as a group. Appetizer list is huge with a little bit of everything and big menu with burgers and sandwiches. The Cuban sandwich is a must try . The oreo dessert is to die for.. the oreo is dipped in a doughnut type of batter that takes it to the next level.  Overall our experience was amazing and will come back"}
{"text":"Happy to be back in Vegas and be introduced to this place.  For a local bar, the food is outstanding.  The salads are all good and as far as comfort food goes?  Wow wow wee wow!!!!!  I highly recommend the mozzarella bites, which for all of you Midwest people, are known as cheese curds!!!  The service is always good every time I'm in there.  The bartenders and bar backs are all super friendly and always attentive!  No empty glasses ever! Courtney, Lisa, Lyndsey, Adam and Patrice are usually behind the bar in some sort of tandem.  With Al, and Carlos helping out.  All are really great people that always make you feel welcome!  If you are looking for a local bar to go out and watch the game, this is your place!  TV's are big and picture quality is spot on!  Lost of Bronco fans, and an unusual amount of annoying Seahawks fans when games are prime time!  Lol just kidding. This place was packed for the World Series and was definitely pro Cubs!  A few Cleveland fans sprinkled in too.  And for all you gamers, there are plenty of machines!  Lots of Ultimate X and Super Times Pay machines on top of your standard machines and even enough higher limit games as well.  Quarter and dollar progressives too, and of course the good ole wheel.  Lots of times you get spins for any 5's thru K's four of a kind.  This place has been added to the local hot spot list!"}
{"text":"Nice little local bar on Las Vegas Blvd. Food is good and bartenders are super friendly. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Everyone who works there is awesome!! This is one bar I can go into anytime of the day or night & know I'm gonna have great service. Since going into this bar I've met new people that work there & have made new friends with them. Great food & drinks. I have and will still recommend this bar to my friends & clients. Very nice chill spot to have drinks & watch sports."}
{"text":"Huevos Rancheros are the bomb. Both the Bleu Cheese Tots and truffle oil tots are terrific. Service is great, Kristina! Open 24/7. The makeover on this place is amazing.  Old GeeBees couldn't hold a candle to the new place. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"My wife and I were staying at the WorldMark location across the street, so this was a very convenient location to stop in for a beverage or two, and a little gaming. On our first visit, I was pleasantly surprised to find Booker's bourbon available as a comped pour, so I took full advantage of that. Our next visit was in the morning, so we asked the bartendress to pour us a bloody mary, which she did; they were so good that we had to have another.  The video poker machines here weren't as tight as I expected, and that is always a plus. I don't mind losing money, but I hate to lose $20 before I've even gotten my first cocktail -- fortunately, that was not the case here. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, great drinks. The bartenders were always excellent. No complaints here.  Bloody Mary was amazing. Sex on the beach was amazing.   On their breakfast menu their potatoes are to die for. Melt in your mouth, but a little crisp on the outside."}
{"text":"Great place to come and just chill & watch Football or just a night out with friends or a date ...food is great!!! Service is on point!!! Would come again!!"}
{"text":"95% of the video poker taverns in Las Vegas have completely average, unremarkable food. Not The Bar, which has by far the best bar food in Las Vegas.  Everything I've ever ordered here has been phenomenal. Prime rib sandwich, burgers, totchos, fried mac & cheese and baked potato bites are all highly recommended. I'll slowly but surely eat my way through the menu."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and strong drinks! Pretty basic as far as Las Vegas bars go but definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Never in my life would I have thought that a place you have to ring a bell in order to be let in would serve one of the best foods ever, but boy howdy!! Yes, I went in super inebriated the first time at 4 a.m, but honestly it was the BEST breakfast food I've ever had! I had the breakfast quesadilla and then mere hours later I came back do lunch and had the buffalo chicken dip and a Moscow mule, both were absolutely delicious and deserve prizes! The staff were super nice too! It's definitely a place you should go to and be surprised by!"}
{"text":"I have to admit i had reservations about this place, and not the kind you make on Opentable.  I had time to kill waiting to pick up my daughter from her mother's and I wanted to watch the Yankees v. Redsox so I went to the first bar I saw.    I expected to find a nearly empty bar of local 50-70 somethings drowning their sorrows over a stale beer and a cigarette while the one bartender tried to stay awake waiting for a drink order.  Well that was my expectation but I am pleased to say the reality was much better.   First off, it was packed.  The bar was filled with happy people enjoying themselves.The average age was probably 35.  There was no problem seeing the TV's and the waitresses were very friendly and happy to chat with the customers, change the channel, make your favorite drink or take your food order.  The patrons were friendly too and it wasn't long until I felt like I was in the old show Cheers.  They even have shuffleboard.  The food was much better than I expected.  A varied menu that includes a variety of tater tots, apps, sandwiches, burgers etc.  I had the tots and a Philly Steak sandwich that was very good.     I wish it wasn't so smokey but that comes with the Vegas territory.    All in all it was a pleasant surprise and definitely worth a repeat trip."}
{"text":"Okay, decent food.  Does allow smoking. Non strip prices."}
{"text":"I usually come here alot... but I had a hotel room across the street and had a family reunion and all my family went here one night and I have to say the customer service is on point. The food was super bomb I had wings and fries and on top of that they didnt skimp on the food... they loaded my plate :) I plan to come back to THE BAR but only this location"}
{"text":"Nice bar with good food. I had the prime rib sandwich and it was terrific. Staff was friendly and accommodating. No complaints in this area.   My problem is that I visit Vegas several times a year. Typically, I'll frequent local bars/pubs to play the gaming machines and drinks are usually free when playing the games. At the end of the night, my bill was about $22 more than I expected due to the drinks. If you're charging for drinks and this is out of the norm for the type of establishment,don't blindside me at the end of the night. Tell me up front or post signs that drinks are not comped. I would've still had drinks but would like to know up front that I'm being charged."}
{"text":"I love this place! Good people, great food, and awesome service! Close to home and a great place to stop on the way home for dinner and a few brews to unwind after work! Thanks for the new convenient chill spot!"}
{"text":"Good food and cold beer, what else do you need?  Well, better wifi would be nice, but now I'm just being picky.  They do have a banquet room for small groups."}
{"text":"Friendly service and great food.  The cheese sauce on the tots and Mac taste home made.  My favorite bar eats!"}
{"text":"The bartenders trying to rip you off was sitting with my friend two different bartender charged me different price for the same drink the food was ok Not better than in any average American bar ..."}
{"text":"Great place..  Food is great and friendly.. Liza took great care of us at lunch.  Thanks liza.. See you all soon"}
{"text":"Stopped by the other night and I must say with football season coming up this bar is a must for game time!! Great TV set up, NFL package, amazing menu with new additions recently added, and the staff is beyond amazing!! Adam and Patrice took care of me however every member down to the Barback makes sure to give you the best service! If you haven't been try the bacon cheddar tots followed by the fried Oreos!! They have 4 locations and hands down the cleanest and best food out of all bars in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"This was my inaugural visit to this location of The Bar. It's not near my usual stomping grounds, but I'm always up for checking out new places.  My party of 2 sat at the bar while one of us was gaming and one was eating. The menu is pretty solid and above average for a poker bar. They have a card now for their slot club, instead of the former weird black doodaddy that sorta looks like a key. They have a wheel promo also that you get to spin for hitting a 4 of a kind.   I was happy it wasn't smoky while we were there. Staff was friendly and had suggestions about the menu when asked. The drink selection is pretty nice and they even had quite a variety of wine beyond red or white, which I appreciate. This was mentioned in other reviews, and also stands out for me- the access. LVBS can be a bitch to drive on, and that would be a factor for me when considering to return here or not."}
{"text":"Just amazing food they have there. Nice place to relax. Fast service, the staff is so friendly to you."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place! So happy that they recently opened The Bar in our neighborhood! Great place to stop in for a cocktail, watch sports and have a snack anytime! Their menu is great- good bar food options and some with an added twist. The food is GREAT! The place is super clean, nice friendly staff, and the place is open 24/7."}
