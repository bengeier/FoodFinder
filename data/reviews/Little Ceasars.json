{"text":"Fast service and fresh food. Close to my house and great option when we don't feel like cooking. The crazy bread is my favorite!"}
{"text":"It's fast-food pizza, what do you expect? I love it for a quick/cheap dinner - you can't beat it for $5. Every time I've been the pizza is hot and ready to go. The only complaint I have with this location is the drive-thru is a TIGHT squeeze for my full size SUV! Be careful driving around the building."}
{"text":"I normally wouldn't come on to Yelp to review a little ceasars but just wanted to say customer service is great here! Bryan was so friendly and chatted with us."}
{"text":"Very friendly place!  Honest people.  My wife dropped her credit card in the parking lot.  Employee found, remembered her name.  Tried to look up phone number to let her know he had found it.  When he could not find a phone number he looked up address and hand delivered card on his own time!

What a awesome guy!  Stopping by to thank again today!"}
{"text":"I generally love Little Ceasars food, the best Italian Cheesy bread on the planet in my opinion...but a recent service issue left me dissapointed, empty-handed and trying to feed a hungry, cranky kiddo before swim class because whomever took my phone-call ahead order failed to enter it into the computer and worse yet, didn't bother to share the order info with any other staff so when I stopped to get my food, nothing was ready . Unfortunately, I didn't have the extra fifteen minutes to wait for them to assemble my misplaced order and when I told the cashier I couldn't wait, aside from her offering to comp me a free small bottle of diet pepsi (which I declined because I'd already returned it to the case by the time she said something), I returned to the car without food and a hungry child so we settled for a burger drivethru."}
{"text":"If you like waiting 15 minutes for a \"hot and ready\" pizza and you like your pizza burnt, then this is your spot!

Not quite sure what happened to the quality of this place. It was good when it first opened and the year or so following. Now, it's mediocre at best. Pay the extra few dollars and get some Dominos - you'll be thankful for it later."}
{"text":"When this place first opened they were on point.  \"Hot and ready\" meant your pizza was hot and ready when you pulled up.  Now you can't even get that.  Had to wait 15 minutes for a cheese pizza after ordering.  No other cars in line.  Quality is hit and miss.  The past two times we've gone our pizza has not even been sliced.  Guess this proves the point you get what you pay for."}
