{"text":"I've known this place since it opened in the original location about 10 years ago.  I've seen it go through two ownership changes as well, but I have to say that it is now so badly run that I don't even bother visiting.  The staff seem asleep on their feet and the owner/manager can't seem to be bothered to make sure that  the place is stocked each day.  on more than one occasion, the staff have had to turn customers away or even shut down in order to replenish basic items.  On top of that, they can't make a half-decent espresso or keep track of orders, so there isn't much point in going unless you like the location."}
{"text":"I would love to see new owner be successful but healthy breakfast options need to improve options."}
{"text":"We have been frequenting Silvercreek for a while now, but they just got their license and have done an amazing job. Went to the opening last weekend and ended up going again Friday night - the butter chicken pizza is fantastic :)

Good food, nice wine selection and they had a local guitar player too. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Light fixtures have disappeared, very bright light bulbs hanging down with nothing on them.
I would say this place is good for coffee drinks only.
I think something has happened to it. 
My chicken club was ok but probably needed to be grilled a little longer and it took 15 minutes. I was really hungry so probably won't be back.
Sad cause I was looking forward to a new place to go."}
{"text":"I come here every once in a while, and every time we receive great coffee and customer service! The lunch and dinner is for light eaters so it's not as filling, but it is still tasty :)
 I enjoy my time here whenever we have live music and whenever we get a spot with the table that we can draw with a chalk!"}
{"text":"Now that there is a full liquor license - this place is even better than before.  We went to the grand opening party last night and were impressed with the food, service, and wine selection.  Definitely stop by for drinks and a light meal - it will be worth your time."}
