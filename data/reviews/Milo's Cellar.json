{"text":"This is the second time I visited Milo's.  Both times I intended to use a coupon, the first time a restaurant.com coupon and the second time an Entertainment Book coupon.  The first time (last May), I was advised that they were't accepting coupons because of an event in Boulder City.  What does an event in the City have to do with your business' willingness to accept a coupon that you offered WITHOUT ANY LIMITATIONS?   The food was good, but I was put off by the poor business practice.  No matter, I visited again with an Entertainment Book coupon in hand, hoping to enjoy new menu items with the bonus of a reduced price.  Lo and behold, my coupon was declined again.  Now they aren't taking ANY coupons, citing \"fraud\".   While I enjoyed the food, I was put off by the fact that they no longer accept coupons of any sort, and specifically those coupons available in the entertainment book and through restaurant.com.  The trouble is, plenty of people drive all the way to Milos from Las Vegas to check it out for the coupon.  I mean, isn't the the whole point of a coupon--to draw new business to your establishment?  Once there, visitors are advised of the new policy against coupons and are essentially stuck there, especially for those traveling from Vegas.    Fraud?!?   What a bogus excuse!  I agree with a previous reviewer that there are many ways to check the validity of the coupons, including calling the vendor to verify authenticity (phone number actually located on the restaurant.com coupons, for example).  Not to mention the fact that there are thousands of businesses on restaurant.com and in the entertainment book, none of which have similar issues.  This is bad business practice, plain and simple.  The managers need to wise up and deal with the problem NOW or they will continue to lose future business.  The irony is that the initial release of the coupons was likely done to increase business and earn repeat customers, but I'm sure this failure to accept pre-purchased coupons has done more to turn away business than anything else.   If you are drawn to visit by the savings you will receive, don't bother.  They are a poor business that doesn't honor their offerings.  The food used to make the drive worth it, but the poor business practices make it a restaurant worth missing.  There are too many good restaurants in Vegas.  If you are in Boulder City, drive a few miles North and try Grape Street or Marche Bacchus--both have better atmospheres and truly care about you, the customer."}
{"text":"Had excellent customer service from a staff member named Aly. This place is adorable and the staff I encountered went above and beyond for me. I never remember names but I remember Aly  Great job"}
{"text":"Milo changed the face of downtown Boulder City.  Fast and friendly (and really good looking....except for those two guys :-)) wait staff.  Reasonable prices.  Consistent food quality.  Great location.  THE place to go in Boulder City."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Milo's Cellar on Tuesday and had a wonderful time. I had the Cowboy salad which was delicious and huge. The dressing was delicious. I was a little hesitant cause it said BBQ sauce and ranch; but it worked. My husband had the Athenian Sandwich which was awesome. The main reason we went because we know Carlo who is the wine person at Albertson in Anthem and he recommended we go to Milo's and he works there also. The service was great. We sat outside and it was just a beautiful afternoon. They allow dogs so you can bring your pets. I highly recommend this restaurant because of it ambience. They also have rooms. We saw the Chianti Room and it was so comforting and nice. Once again thank you Milo for giving us a great afternoon and delicious food. My husband told me that Boulder City is the only town that does not allow gambling! I will recommend Milo's Cellar to all my friends. P.S. They have over 100 wines and 60 beers available. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"What a little gem! I found Milo's on Yelp after visiting the Hoover Dam. Our lunch was fantastic, the service pleasant, and the prices very good. Nice to see the vast array of wines for sale too! I will be back!"}
{"text":"The way we found out about this place is through the folks at SkyDiveVegas.com. As part of our sky diving package, we order photos and a video. It takes them a while to make the CD and DVD so we told them we were going to run up the road and check out the Hoover Dam and then come back to pick up the CD/DVD. They recommended us going to Milo's to grab a bit to eat if we were hungry.   This place seems so out of place and no one really knows about it except for the locals outside of Vegas. It's a shame because this place has incredible sandwiches, a great wine and micro-brew beer selection, awesome decor and the service is great and friendly to boot - all at very reasonable prices.  If you head out this way to sky dive or check out the Hoover Dam or the Grand Canyon, definitely plan on having lunch or a light dinner at Milo's.   And to add to it, Boulder City is a pretty cool little town with incredible views of Lake Mead from the top of it."}
{"text":"Probably one of the more upscale places you'll find on this street. It has nice patio seating, smaller inside but still felt comfortable. The decor is beautiful for a small town. Very clean atmosphere, not to loud, great service, safe environment for children and wonderful for a date night. We walked in a few other places on this street and were about ready to give up until we found Milo's. The food is good-not a ton of flavor in the pasta, but I am Italian so I'm hard to judge in this area, the wine was great, and everything was fresh. I would definitely come back again when visiting."}
{"text":"Service is sub-par. I never got more water NOR did the guy ever remember to bring me my mirrorpond. well fine. but i liked the salad a lot."}
{"text":"My mom worked at this place, I went there and I got the pasties and a hot chocolate. They have a wine and alcohol room. They have a pond in the middle of the area, its right outside the rooms. There are little fishes and a baby turtal and a momma turtal. I don't recommend it, but if you wanna get wasted and have a room to have a hangover in."}
{"text":"We were passing through Boulder City and decided to eat at a Triple D joint but it was closed.  Our closest option was Milo's.  We were a party of 7. Service was great. They immediately accommodated us. All food was fresh and everyone enjoyed their meal. The wait staff was very informative and attentive.  If you are in Boulder City it is a good choice to eat at Milo's."}
{"text":"Very good Sandwiches.  Not too far from the Hoover Dam.  My husband and I had the Vegetarian sandwiches.  Our sandwiches had the option of chips, fries, or a red cabbage slaw. We ordered the red cabbage slaw, good choice. My son ordered the Caesar turkey wrap. Wow!  The flavors were amazing.  Fairly quick service and friendly waitress.  The only downside was being next to the bar with kids.  Patrons at the bar were a bit off color and someone was smoking outside.  Although we would have sat outside if there wasn't smoke.  They had misting machines and a nice breeze.  There were curtains that gave the sidewalk seating feel more upscale.  Very nice!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for 8 yrs but never disappointed me. Athenian sandwich is my absolute favorite. Had one of the cellar cheese platters today and I'm glad i ordered it. The servers are very friendly and patient when we were deciding which platter to get. She kindly explained each one of them. We had fantastic time over all."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Milo's Cellar.  I have been going there for years and thought it was time for a review.  Milo's is my escape from Las Vegas.  When I go there I can forget all about Las Vegas.  I am in a small little town and it is very peaceful.  Great outside area, tables right on the sidewalk.  I only go there for the wine however.  I don't think the food is very good, so I just don't eat there.  The sandwiches are okay actually, just a little expensive.  You can pick any bottle of wine and open it there for only $10 more.  It makes for a great deal.  Also, women are half price on Wednesdays and men on Fridays.  The best place in the valley to sit outside and have a bottle of wine."}
{"text":"Great quaint spot for lunch or dinner.  Awesome wine selection.  Definitely have to get a tour of place, it has an hideaway retreat bed and breakfast hidden inside the place that you can stay the night.  I love this place, great romantic get away if they still have the b and b specials."}
{"text":"If you come to Boulder City for the Coffee Cup, go to Milo's instead.  Great selection of wines, by the glass or by the bottle.  Food is creative and down right good.  Milo's is a great diversion for an afternoon away from the hum, smoke, and A Clowns you encounter in Vegas. The Bordeaux Platter was awesome - spanish manchego, a variety of cheeses, grapes, and olives.  You can sit outside under cover with overhead heaters (winter)/misters (summer) and people watch for hours. Personal pizzas also are a good choice.  This is a great stop on your way back from Hoover Dam. My service was great - but after all I am Speedracer."}
{"text":"We finally started going to Milo's Cellar this year after walking by many times, looking in the windows and seeing people sitting outside enjoying a glass of wine. What a great atmosphere! Last night, we discovered even more of this place and I think I want to make it a weekend hangout!   There were six of us who met at Milo's Cellar to do some wine tasting with their Flight of Wines. This is great because you can try three of their wines for $15. You choose from their menu, but there's enough of a selection where we each got something different and ended up sipping each others...hum, we all must be really good friends!   The service is wonderful. It's basically a seat yourself place, so upon arriving, we were greeted by our server and we told him that we had six people. There weren't any tables available outside, so he told us we could slide tables over however we wanted inside to accommodate our group. He immediately started setting us up with glasses, menus, etc., and as the rest of the group arrived, he was answering questions about the different wines, giving us samples of some and making recommendations.   In the middle of our wine evening, we decided to order a cheese platter. It was a wonderful assortment of quality cheeses and also had olives, some incredible crackers and red grapes. Though the platter looks small coming out, it was the perfect amount for six people to share. Suddenly, our server appeared with another dish. He brought us complimentary smoked mozzarella caprese....oh, this was wonderful. Now that is good service.   For the atmosphere...we asked if they could accommodate a larger group, like for our wine club...absolutely! Not only is the outside of Milo's great to sit and enjoy a glass of wine (and people watch), just inside is gorgeous and looks like a wine cellar. Our server gave us a tour of the rest of Milo's. There is an area that accommodates larger groups with tables for more of a restaurant feel, but as you walk down to it, you feel like you are entering another wine cellar. It made me feel like I was on vacation in Italy. To top it off, he took us to show us Milo's Inn. You go up some narrow stairs, then suddenly enter the courtyard and are transformed into another world. I want to make reservations for a weekend getaway!   Milo's has a lot to offer. What a great hidden treasure for those of us who want to escape Vegas for a moment!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good and in a pleasant area. Good sandwiches n chips, beer is good for a good price. Never had the wine though. Next time Milo, next time. Wonder if the drunk native will pass by and wink at us again."}
{"text":"A friend and I went to Milo's for lunch yesterday, and were surprised to find a flyer tucked inside the menu stating that Milo's will no longer accept ANY coupons, due to \"fraud\". The waitress said it was the owner's decision, and that it includes Milo's coupons from Entertainment Books, even when torn directly from the book, as well as Restaurant.com certificates, which have serial numbers, authorization codes, and a toll-free number vendors can call to verify the authenticity of the certificate. I find it insulting that a business owner would generate coupons, then accuse anyone who buys them and tries to use them of \"fraud\". I won't bother going back to Milo's. There are plenty of great restaurants just minutes from Boulder City."}
{"text":"A little gem hidden in the historic downtown of Boulder City, some 20 minutes south of Vegas. Absolutely great wine list, I tried 3 wines and they were all fantastic! Also superb collection of craft beers. The \"Bordeaux\" cheese plate I had was ripe and abundant. It's quite a small space, intimate and woody and good for conversation. There's a small bar area if you want to be sociable. The service was excellent ---- definitely an excape from Vegas! Small town feel....big time wines."}
{"text":"I was on a trip recently to Boulder City and I noticed this restaurant's dishes on outdoor tables. The food looked fresh and refined - colorful and elegant with a rustic appeal not only found on the dish but in the bistro itself.   I ordered one of the daily specials - a Salmon Sandwich - and had the typical vegetable chips, grape, and pickle side. The salmon tasted fresh and lightly seasoned. The sauce and lettuce went hand in hand. The best part of the sandwich was the Kaiser bun. It had a mellow buttery flavor that was very light and in no way buttery/greasy. I'd assume their bakery/baked goods are divine as well.  Customer service was pleasant. I did have to wait a little over 25 minutes for a sandwich, but the atmosphere was easy going and warm. There was an amazing assortment of countless varieties of wine on the walls/around us. The waiter who took our order knew the menu very well, which is always great to hear. He was very kind to us on our first visit."}
{"text":"For the cafe and bakery side   The service was great. The barista was friendly and very helpful.   The coffee was not the greatest. It was very very sweet and not much coffee flavor. So if you like sweet coffee drinks this is the place to go. But if you want more of a coffee then make sure you tell then to hold the flavor/syrup."}
{"text":"So many beverages to chose from. One of the only restaurant that serves Strongbow cider too. The sandwiches were delicious and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Stayed there to celebrate birthdays. Nice clean room. Serve complementary breakfast outside the rooms. Check in was a bit strange as the guy in the kitchen checked us in as the inn guys was not there. Within walking distance of several restaurants and bars."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped by after a marathon antiquing adventure.  Great drinks- I had sparkling wine and my honey had an IPA- and although we didn't order food the orders leaving the kitchen looked and smelled heavenly! Prices were reasonable and staff was friendly! Worth stopping by again!"}
{"text":"I read the reviews, saw they were a bit mixed but overall ok. We decided to try it for lunch .  I would not come back. I had the cranberry salad. Some of the salad greens were very wilted. The server forgot the bread. We sat outside when I went in to use the restroom I saw how dirty the kitchen was."}
{"text":"Great place:) They have like an avocado, alfalfa sprout, and brie cheese croissant sandwich that is soooooo awesome! Also, they have some good Sangria:)"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with my sweetheart. He had the lobster roll, he liked it, said it was a good sandwich, not the way he would have done it, it did have a lot of stuff in it. He prefers keep it simple with lobster, so don't need all that stuff. But he ate it all, haha  I however had the French Kiss, it was amazing, the meat was moist & juicy and spiced perfectly, mushrooms & cheese were good, bread was fresh and just right for the sandwich. The au jus was yummy. And I got the potato salad, I wanted to lick the bowl it was so tasty:)  Service was great. I will go here again for sure to try the other sandwiches I wanted."}
{"text":"BEST FOOD EVER - really enjoyed the small town atmosphere.  Homemade Meatballs in Sub were amazing and Creme Brûlée was fabulous!!"}
{"text":"Nice place to sit outside and enjoy a glass of wine and a small bite. Servers are friendly, live music, nice by the glass wine list = good time."}
{"text":"I have been to Milo's several times, the atmosphere is wonderful as well as the wine selection. The Anaheim chile chicken sandwich is a favorite of mine, but the caesar salad is a close 2nd.  I think most of my four star rating comes from the atmosphere and the sandwiches, because the customer service is subpar. The waitstaff is not rude in any way, but extremely slow and seemingly forgetful. Entrees were given several minutes before soup, clam chowder was awesome!, and after at least 2 requests, desert was forgotten and the waitstaff seemed absentminded to our whole order.  Although there are items for children on the menu.. Not a great place to take kids... But you can sit with your pet outside, that is if you like to eat your food next to other peoples dogs.  Bottom line. Decent sandwiches, absentminded service."}
{"text":"I really enjoy my visits to Milo's.  The service is great, a glass of red wine, a relaxing chat with friends and a delicious Mediterranean Chef Salad.  I love to sit outside regardless of what time of year it is but especially love it in the springtime.  I definitely will be going back soon."}
{"text":"Amazing food!! Wonderful service!  Melissa is a top notch server who recommended some great dishes!! Try the med. salad!! Yummy!! Will retun for sure! And the wine cellar inside is to die for!!"}
{"text":"Went right when they were opening & sat outside. Service was wonderful, never forgotten. The wine list  is unimpressive however the beer list is nice. Prices very reasonable. Had a cheese platter definitely worth it! Nice little stop for a quick drink & snack."}
{"text":"Excellent menu and friendly staff.amazing beer and wine list. Casual but classiest joint in town."}
{"text":"I drive out to Boulder City just to go eat at Milo's. Love the sandwiches. My favorite is the caprese salad. It's a great place to sit outside on the patio and watch people :)"}
{"text":"Sangria and hummus.Great wait staff.Very relaxing atmosphere.Frequent at least once a week."}
{"text":"Wine and cheese, al fresco dining ... a perfect afternoon pick-me-up.  We enjoyed a $20 bottle of Stone Cellars merlot, coupled with the Chianti Platter which was loaded with salami, peppers, olives, cheese, marinated artichokes, a ramekin of balsamic vinegar and more.  My only complaint was the bread.  Certainly plentiful, but should be crustier.  Our server was charming, the service a little slow (but who cares?)    I'd come back."}
{"text":"We were here in February 2010 for President's Day weekend for an event at UNLV.  Both my husband and I don't like the hype or bustle of Vegas so we opted to stay in Boulder City.  The first 2 nights we had tried other places in town which turned out to be mediocre.  The last night we stumbled on Milo's and had a couple of great sandwiches and good wine.    I'm surprised at the reviews of lax and rude service.  I guess we got lucky.  Our server was fast and pleasant."}
{"text":"Happened to drive by during lunch and was very pleasantly surprised with their sandwiches. Service was spot on, friendly servers and great ambiance.  If we find ourselves back in this area, we will definitely return."}
{"text":"A very quaint cute street that reminds me of small towns such as in Colorado Rocky's or the Midwest.  I love it cause of that.  Milo's is one place I frequent when visitng this area.  For almost a decade, I have been coming here and will share my favorites!  Also a few places to check out.    *Flight Plan which includes three 3-oz. wine pours.  They had two  Chardonnay's and one Pinot Grigio so I got that.  Calina (3), Carmenet (5) & Montavina (2).  $15  *Beef Blue & Dews with a Cole Slaw side, even though they offer a Potato Salad, Strawberry Salad or Fries, etc.  The roasted Prime Rib, Gorgozola and what are supposed to be Peppadews, were like long Red Peppers, but still great.  I like Peppadews way better though. $12.95  *Candied Walnut Cranberry Salad w/ Grilled Chicken!!  The BEST ever and a must order for when you visit Milo's!  Blue cheese crumbles, dried cranberry, bacon bits, red onion, candied walnuts and a raspberry vinaigrette!  Absolutely AMAZING!  $12.95+ chicken  10% off Cases of Wine Usually art for sale on the walls Outdoor/Indoor seating Bar Inn Martini Mondays 4p to close Ladies Night half off drinks 4p to 7p Friday Night half off for Gentlemen 4-7p Beer selection Take-Out  Playing tour guides of Boulder City for my parents today, you work up an appetite.

Sometimes, around the block, more big horned sheep are 'mowing' the neighbor's lawn or standing like statues in a lawn. -Pirate's Cove Mansion -Railroad Hiking Trail  -Hoover Dam Lookout  -Historic Boulder City, Nevada Way with Milo's and many other wonderful locales spots.  Lots to see and do out in this area.  I definitely will post more each time cause I love many places out here!"}
{"text":"Great visit for a Sunday afternoon. Pauline was a great server, and the food terrific!! The sangria was a great addition too :) Life music filled the air from (Jacks PlaceH next door, which was perfect without being overbearing on conversation. If your looking for a great meal on an easy, breezy, sunday afternoon... This is the place!!"}
{"text":"Great little place. Seating outside. Waitress was wonderful & very helpful. Clam Chowder was off the chain. Caprese was exceptional."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great. Come for the wine and not for the food. The soup was cold and it tasted like someone just added an instant seasoning and some water to old soup. At least this was the case for the Italian Wedding Soup."}
{"text":"Great find in Boulder City! The place is very cute and bistro-like. Our server was very attentive, and we enjoyed a hummus appetizer and three pasta entrees. The portions are huge (compared to west coast portion sizes) and the wine selection is exceptional. Would definitely go back, and would recommend for anyone into Italian with a classy vibe."}
{"text":"I would definitely recommend this place if you are looking for some place to eat in Boulder City.  Specially since the pickins are rather slim.  Being a vegetarian, I was still able to have a highly enjoyable meal here, and I like the fact I can order small portions/split an appetizer or get a sandwich.  Warning, this place does not  have cooked meals..........it's either sandwiches, snacky foods or salads... anything that goes good with wine.  AND that was OK by me.  They also have a great selection of bottled beer.  In fact I would recommend checking out the bottled beer selection at Milo's over and above the Boulder Dam Brewery down the street any day!"}
{"text":"Well this place felt like a local bar.  The drunk local wine sippers scaring many people to the next room.  Unfriendly service, dirty wine glasses and plastic water cups.  Run upstairs from this cellar."}
{"text":"Good beers available.  Probably good wines available.  Good ambiance inside.  Good service. Delicious sandwiches: we had the 'beef, blue, and dews' and the 'Italian dip' sandwiches. (Amazing)  Other notes include: outdoor seating available, buy bottles of wine with a $10 corking fee to drink on site, seasonal beverage items, 'Martini Mondays' 4pm to close, 'Ladies Night Wednesdays' 1/2 off the lady's drinks from 4-8pm, and 'PIG (Professional Intellectual Gentlemen's) Night' 1/2 off all the gentlemen's drinks from 4-7pm."}
{"text":"Although my husband's Italian Dip sandwich was delicious, my Greek Spinach salad was boring. The waiter's attitude, though, made us want to just finish our dinner and get out of there."}
{"text":"A great little wine bar. And the soup was a perfect antidote for a blustery winter day. Good service and great food - how can you beat that?"}
{"text":"Nice spot that's more of a wine bar than a restaurant as their name indicates.  Big selection of wines. Their food menu is not the largest.   We sat outside and the Parisian and the Reuben sandwiches which were pretty good but not spectacular.   Their little cabbage side salad which came as an option instead of your usual fries was way overkilled with oregano!  It took quite a while to get the food but the servers were rather attentive."}
{"text":"I love Milo's.  Been here a few times and realized I had never left them a review.  They have a fabulous selection of wine along with a full bar.  They even have different ciders that can be hard to find.  Our server was friendly and made some good wine suggestions based on our preferences.  The food is excellent too.  Shared a cheese plate and lobster roll with my mom, delish!  They have a nice variety of soups, salads, and sandwiches.  Milo's has outside seating so it's a perfect place to enjoy the fresh air and sip a glass of wine in downtown Boulder."}
{"text":"When you are in Boulder stop by millie and ask for Rob the food is great the drinks are better!"}
{"text":"spent mothers day afternoon here with my mom and my dad.  we just had a glass of wine and an appetizer.  the setting is nice, outside in the shade on the sidewalk along the main road that goes through down town.  it was nice because they were giving all the mothers roses for mothers day.  everything we had was good, although we didnt actually have a real meal.  was a nice way to spend some time together!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp on way back to Las Vegas from Hoover Dam. Lived up to its good reviews. Very friendly waitress and good food and service. Casual atmosphere in this small wine shop. About 8 tables for 2-4 people along with a small bar inside with a flat screen tv.  Cost was $30 for two sandwiches and two drinks."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch here after going to the Hoover Dam. I ordered the white sangria, and my husband ordered a wine flight that included very generous 3 oz. servings of 3 different wines for only $15. It was a great value, and all the drinks were delicious. For lunch we ordered the Cultured Cowboy Salad (BBQ Chicken), and the Pollo Bella sandwich. Both entrees were delicious! We only wish there had been a little bit more chicken on the sandwich."}
{"text":"Great spot. Simple menu with daily specials. Had two appetizers, hummus and smoked salmon carpaccio, both were excellent. Fantastic wine menu, red sangria was superb, local beer well worth trying. Street side patio is great place to sit in this funky part of old town Boulder."}
{"text":"When we arrived here and decided to sit in the outside seating I thought it was very cool and I liked the feel of the place.  The service was absolutely horrible. Our server barely cracked a smile the whole time and even when my friend was trying to yuk it up with him, it was obvious that he was wishing he were somewhere else. You could actually tell that any smile he was able to muster, was a serious effort for him. I don't know, maybe the guy was just having a bad day. But you know, bad day or not if you're in this kind of business you just need to suck it up and put on your happy face. Try to make the people you're helping at least feel like they are the only people on the planet. That shouldn't be so difficult. You know how some people work as food servers and it's probably the last thing they should be doing? The word \"warehouse\" comes to mind, thank you very much.  I had the Greek salad which I found to be absolutely disgusting because it was swimming in dressing. I know I should have asked for it on the side but alas, I forgot. You shouldn't be putting that much dressing on it anyway. It was so horrible that I could not finish it and since the server never came back to the table to check on us, there was no way I could have informed him. So, when he finally came back when we were finished our meal, he didn't even ask me why there was so much salad in my bowl. What a goober.  Bad, bad, bad. There ya go!"}
{"text":"We found this on Yelp on our way back from Hoover Dam. The Bordeaux platter (cheese plate w/ grapes) was huge and great. They have a great selection of wines and you can buy a bottle and for $10 corkage fee drink with your meal. Great wines in all price ranges. We also shared a salad which was very nice and a very good Tomato Basil soup. Our server was fabulous. A great find in a cute section of town w/ antique shops and funky stuff!"}
{"text":"Several friends have recommended this place when I've mentioned heading out to Boulder City- I don't drink often, but the soups and salads have always been more the highlight than the wine. I can't say I was super impressed by my visit, but that wouldn't stop me from going back in the future.  Large list of salads and sandwiches made it hard to decide what to get. Ultimately went with the Mediterranean Chef salad ($12) and a cup of the soup of the day- French onion ($5). The salad itself was okay, plenty of toppings and flavors. The soup was disappointing, or as the server called it, \"not bad but different!\" It seemed to be a southwest take on French onion soup- think of a pozole broth with onions inside and the usual cheese crouton. Not for me.  Props to the staff: business picked up as soon as they opened with plenty of groups sitting on the patio. There seemed to be only one server and she kept up with everyone. I also appreciated that she removed the uneaten soup from my bill without having to be asked.   Speaking of prices, the link on this business page takes you to the B&B rather than the restaurant page. If you Google it, you can find the menu but be aware that prices have increased by about $2/item."}
{"text":"Great place to grab food out in peaceful boulder city.  Their sandwich selection is brilliant.  The outdoor seating is very peaceful and it's a nice place to spend the afternoon outside of the city of Las Vegas.  The staff is friendly and they have a lot of wine club events.  The food quality wasn't great on my last visit, had the Ruben and it was very chewy.  But of all the times I've been, that's only happened once.  Awesome place overall."}
{"text":"Perhaps the best restaraunt in Nevada. Casual, yet elegant. Wine is excellent, and not expensive. The food is creative, fresh, and fantastic. Ambiance is low key, but classy. Service is professional, and makes you feel like royalty. I would give this place 6 stars if I could, just like Nobu in Malibu which is a different kind of restaurant value. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Daily dinner specials, Good tasty food, veggie options, nice ambiance, and attentive service!! Glad we found this place!! Thank you!"}
{"text":"This Boulder City wine bar and restaurant can transport you to another place... just check-in upstairs (they have a little boutique Bed & Breakfast here too) and you can relax in the hidden lush garden patio when not resting your eyes in their sweetly designed rooms. I booked a party with Milo and his staff in May 2016 and this quaint little gem did not disappoint!  The food is absolutely amazing (everyone agreed), the wine selection elegant and the staff treated us like family.  We will always be in debt to Milo's Celler and the wonderful people who helped us enjoy our time there. I go there any time I am near Boulder City even just to say hi to Milo and enjoy a glass of red."}
{"text":"Great little spot in the middle of historic Boulder City. So if you are heading to lake mead or Hoover Dam and you would like a nice glass of wine, stop in here and enjoy yourself. You can see the good places when you notice the locals hanging out. Go there, relax and enjoy."}
{"text":"Nice place decent menu and outdoor seating. So why do I give it a one star? That's for one simple inexcusable reason. They don't list their soups on the menu. As it changes daily that is fine and totally understandable. So when I ask them what the soup of the day was they said French onion or potato leek. I have them onion have a beef stock and he said yes so I immediately order the potato leek soup as I have not had meat in many years. A couple bites in I was horrified to find chicken chunks in the potato leek soup. I have had potato leek soup many times in my life never did it have chunks of chicken. I asked the waitress if it was chicken and to my greater horror she told me no its bacon. I have never had bacon in my entire life and don't care to. I am giving them one star because if you're going to add something like bacon to a potato leek soup and not having written on the menu then you should inform your customer when they order that it contains meat or bacon. I know for some of you its not a big deal but for someone who has never had bacon in their entire life it was a very big deal to me. And I cannot be the only person that this has happened to. If the owners are reading this either have the waitress disclose that there is bacon on a meat and potato leek soup when the order is taken or just put it on your menu. I will not return for this reason. I know it wasn't on purpose I know it was an honest mistake. But but good management would have prevented this from happening before hopefully they will see this and not let it happen again."}
{"text":"We have been to Milo's several times . We spent our anniversary weekend in Boulder City and had dinner an amazing bottle of wine , dinner, and dessert! AMAZING!! Try Milos! Jess"}
{"text":"What a great place to spend a Sunday morning! The patio tables got just enough sun , a cool breeze and allowed us to bring the puppies. A bottle of rose bubbles, smoked salmon plate, tuna tartar, perfect roast beef sandwich and a lobster roll ... yum! Highly recommended for anyone looking for a neighborhood restaurant feel , approachable price and great hospitality. Be back soon!"}
{"text":"Visit started out a little rocky, they told us to sit anywhere we wanted and then some guy started yelling at us that we needed to sit at a smaller table (from down the sidewalk, super awkward, don't say \"Sit anywhere!\" and then make people move-- there are currently two people sitting there, rather than a group of four, must have been our look he didn't like?). The beer and wine list is pretty decent and very reasonably priced. My husband and I shared the cheese potato soup and it was AMAZING. I ordered the lobster roll (huge chunks of lobster, great bread) and my husband had a Ruben (all he said was, \"It was good.\"). Open air seating, soft music, great feel, great area. We'll definitely be back (and make sure not to upset the troll)."}
{"text":"Lunch with the ladies was a real treat with the menu at Milo's Cellar! The food was fresh and delicious and huge, we had to get a couple of containers for what we could not finish. The staff are courteous, knowledgeable and attentive. We liked that we could sit outside since the weather was so nice. Definitely our favorite place to go in Boulder City, we live in Las Vegas and like to visit B.C. often. Ther also have a B & B so I'm bringing my hubby for a romantic weekend soon!"}
{"text":"I really used to love Milo's. They had wonderful cheese plates, an excellent French Dip with peppers and although the service is always typically Boulder City speed, it wasn't too bad.  Over the last year, they've systematically removed everything we liked about it. No more Terra Chips. No more good sandwiches except the Athenian.  Would have ordered an appetizer but they got rid of their excellent cheese and meat trays. Now you have to choose- no tray has both cheese and meat. Food isn't bad but it's not special at all.  The food used to overcome the so-so service but tonight, we got such bad service- not necessarily the fault of the servers but it did not seem THAT busy for a Friday night. Maybe not enough staff?  It took 15 minutes after seating tonight to get our drink order completed.  At that time, we asked for bread which never came. Two items I asked for were not available, early in the dinner hour.  Our food did come quickly but my sandwich was missing a key ingredient.  After 10 minutes of waiting for a server to appear, I asked about that missing ingredient and was told a side of it would be brought.  Also never came.  Tried to eat my sandwich slowly, waiting for that side but gave up.  Meanwhile,  my partner had to chase down our drink order after 15 minutes of not receiving it after ordered.  No acknowledgement ever made of the missing item or the bread that wasn't brought or the late drink order.  Bill was brought before we were even asked if we were done- one of my huge pet peeves- especially at a wine bar!  No one was waiting and we were not done (not a shift change either).  I don't know that it was necessarily a server issue but really felt the whole experience of relaxing and enjoying good food and drinks was no longer a priority at Milo's Cellar."}
{"text":"Dinner on a Saturday night after hiking in the desert...it was a good choice.  Take the warning on the sangria seriously - it's got quite a punch!  We ordered a salad to share, the bruschetta and French onion soup.  Everything was good and fresh, though I felt like nothing was fantastic.  The salad was perfectly dressed, though - and that's something I don't see often enough in restaurants!   Service was top notch, and it was fun to sit out on the patio and watch Boulder City go by.  This town is way more fun than I thought it would be!"}
{"text":"I've come here several times while I was living in Boulder. I even got picked up as an extra for a scene in \"Mind Freak\" while eating outside here with a friend.   Here's the thing; when Milo's opened, it was the first of it's kind in the little city. They had a selection of brews and wines that was unrivaled for miles in the area with slightly classed up Euro-inspired food. However, the owner, actually named Milo, earned a bad rap among some of the locals for shady business practices; things like not paying his carpenters for work done.   The restaurant has a nice ambiance when it isn't cluster-clucked. When it's crowded, good luck. There's a bed and breakfast area attached in the back with a little pond and several rooms. There used to be a coffee bar as well as live music shows several times a week, but I think those have both ceased. The coffee bar has been closed for awhile but the equipment may still be in use, but no guarantee.  Flat $10 corkage fee applies to all bottles, including the $11 HobNob. No reminder of the fee, it's simply added to your check, so be aware that even when you get a cheap bottle, it's actually $10 more if you intend to drink with your meal.   The food? Well, the chili we tried was awful. It tasted like canned meat with MSG. We finished our small portion, but for $5 I could've gotten something far tastier elsewhere. We each ordered a sandwich with the terra chips. Each sandwich runs between $7-10 and came with grapes, chips & a pickle, as well as a cup of water with a wedge of lemon. The sandwiches were pretty good but not so extraordinary as to be memorable. I've had tasty soups here in the past, but that was several years ago."}
{"text":"I love the ambience. I just really, really wish the food menu offered a better variety."}
{"text":"Awesome food and unbelievable service from our waitress Kristina.  Would definitely recommend to stop here."}
{"text":"Went here 11/19.I ordered the chianti platter,my gf the cranberry salad.Portions were generous,the salad was huge and delicious.We each had a glass of wine.Servers were friendly,orders came quick.Nice atmosphere.Look foward to trying some other menu items and taking a drive from Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Wednesday night sat outside very nice. Ordered the salmon appetizer fantastic! The atmosphere is tranquility. Everything was great! However, as friendly as our experienced  waiter was, he mentioned \"customers are not always right\" on and on he went. I felt offended as I was his customer! After we paid, my group stayed chatting to enjoy the atmosphere. He asked if we wanted waters, but I never got one. I reminded him I wanted one too, he never brought it. I'm assuming he didn't like me as his customer."}
{"text":"Loved my experience here. Patio dining, delicious food and wine, friendly staff. My husband and I split an antipasto platter and sandwich, which was plenty for the two of us. It's right next door to a sports bar, so if you want a quieter evening, sit on the side where the candy shop is. Waitress and hostess were super sweet and attentive. Will return for sure."}
{"text":"Whenever  I visit  Boulder  City I stop by Milo's.  Love sitting outside and enjoy the white  peach sangria.  The menu  is light with sandwiches, salads and more on the light side. The cheese tray with crackers and grapes is a winner.  Theu gave variety of good wine. Love love this place"}
{"text":"Beef sandwhich with bleu cheese......... Order it!!!!"}
{"text":"Why did they change their menu?  Ever heard of \"if it ain't broke don't fix it?\" I really miss their buffalo chicken salad. Good thing they still have a wine I love. I will occasionally come here just for wine, but not crazy about their latest menu changes.  The servers are ok, depending on who you get.... Some of them just seem pissed to be there, the others actually smile:) Nice outdoor dining."}
{"text":"Bad customer service and they don't respond to complaints.  Enjoy waiting!"}
{"text":"Super cute but kinda hipster little spot outside of Vegas. Reasonable prices and friendly service"}
{"text":"Came from Puerto Rico referred by Yelp. It was an excellent experience. Great food and service.  Ecellent option for everyone. Also the variety of wines are super good.  Thanks Brandy for a great service..."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday for a date night with the boyfriend and to get away from Vegas. Pleasantly surprised with the ambiance and the service.  I love a good wine bar.  Despite the extensive wine selection the beer selection was also abundant.  I'm glad small local businesses don't shy away from trying to add something new.  I ordered the French Kiss sandwich and it was incredibly flavorful and filling.  I had a glass of Robert Mondavi Cabernet which was aged in a bourbon barrel.  As someone who loves wine and bourbon having this option on the menu was a huge bonus.  Would love to go back when the weather is cooling down to sit outside.  Amy was awesome with checking in on us, asking our opinions about the wine selection and striking up conversation about the bar."}
{"text":"Milos for lunch is the best, love the 1/2 soup and sandwich special. I love the classic small town hospitality."}
{"text":"Oh no! I will not be back! We stopped it for an espresso and had nothing but rude service from a gal at the bar! First she said \"you gotta be kidding me\" when a man directed us to the bar for coffee. I watched her set down her e cigarette in anger. We asked for espresso and she said they didn't have any right now (espresso machine was clearly there and a table had espresso) . Then as we were leaving I heard her complain about the fact that I told her to keep the change....I didn't think she even deserved that. Hope her cigarette helps her find a better attitude."}
{"text":"Love the service, wine menu is wonderful...but the food menu needs expanding. I would love it if there were a tasting menu with wine accompaniments"}
{"text":"The staff were nice and efficient.  The food is what gives it the low rating.  Three of us ordered the lobster roll and, instead of lobster on a toasted buttered roll, we were served fake seafood on day old rolls from a not very good bakery.  The French Onion soup was good."}
{"text":"Four stars for a great wine selection, generous flights of three vins from all on their menu-$15.00.   I'd give the food a little less in stars based on a strange onion soup, somewhat flavorful but not what you'd expect from a good and traditional onion soup.  The beef, blue cheese and pepper sandwich was great, highly recomend it.  The cheescake, not great, surprising since part of this business is a bakery.  It was slightly dry and topped with chocolate that tasted like Bosco (remember Bosco?) syrup. I may have done better with the raspberry topping on the cheesecake-who knows..."}
{"text":"A group of us stopped here for dinner on our way back to Vegas after visiting the Hoover Dam. The service and food was amazing! The Sangria was awesome!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner hear Wednesday night. Great food, atmosphere & I could watch World Series game. I had Roast Beef Sandwich w/Blue Cheese. Excellent"}
{"text":"The good: After a long day of driving, we wanted a simple easy in, easy out kinda place. Wife has the cowboy salad and I had the Mediterranean salad: both were very good.  Kids had wraps and they were 'meh' but that review is coming from teenagers.     The great:  Great craft beer selection!!   Stop in, check em out!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy going to Milos because it is typically a step up from the rest of what Boulder City has to offer.  Lovely atmosphere and usually pretty good food.  But lately, and particularly this evening, the food has not been that great and I really don't want to see Milo's become lax in its offering.  Tonight I ordered one of the specials, a grilled salmon sandwich, and it was so tasteless that I almost returned it.  But then you know what they say about returning food.  Milo's, revisit your standards, ensure your chef is putting out only the very best.  A restaurant cannot live on atmosphere alone."}
{"text":"Great place \"no one knows about\".  If you feel the urge to get away on a lazy Saturday afternoon, go to Boulder City and right in the center of town sits Milo's.  Outside sidewalk tables are the best.  You can enjoy a wine/cheese platter and watch the people go by.  Great prices and food & atomspere is A++!"}
{"text":"Motorcycle ride to Boulder City from Las Vegas (25 mins) to have a great lunch on the outdoor covered patio at Milo's Cellar with wifey. I had a glass of nice red wine (Merlot $5) to go with a French Kiss sandwich ($12.95). That's a roasted prime rib, portabella mushrooms, Swiss cheese and mayo served with au jus on a French loaf and choice of side for $12.95.  Delicious. Friendly staff and clean bathroom."}
{"text":"We happened to find this place on way home from lake.  We were looking for something light and fresh.  It was a very nice and friendly place.  Food was great.  Light and fresh.  We even tried a flight of wines which was fun.  They were having Martini night.   We plan to make this one of our \"go to\" places in the future."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved and enjoyed everything about this hidden gem. The ambiance, the delicious food, the quick and friendly service. Definitely recommend it to anyone who is in the area looking for a nice lunch or dinner. We sat outside on the patio and the weather was absolutely beautiful out. I had the glass of red blend- Mischief, delicious not too dry not too sweet right in the middle with bold, rich flavors."}
{"text":"Milo's Cellar in Downtown Boulder City is a great place for lunch with the opportunity to sample a variety of wines at at a reasonable price.  The day of our visit was perfect to enjoy lunch on the sidewalk patio. The place was doing a robust business with a mix of locals and tourists.   Service was attentive and friendly. There is a wide variety of salads, sandwiches and platters to choose. There also is a chalk board with specials.  Salads are large portions and use fresh ingredients. We choose the Mediterranean Chef Salad  and the Mixed Green Salad. I especially liked the Mediterranean Salad with small pieces of turkey, sopressata and provolone. The Caesar dressing was lightly applied.   The Green Salad had spring mix with cherry tomatoes, onions, cucumbers, garlic croutons, with our choice of the raspberry walnut vinaigrette.   Milo's is a nice day trip from Las  Vegas. While there take a walking tour of the Public Art, mostly sculptures along Nevada Way and Arizona streets."}
{"text":"Visiting from Georgia, sightseeing in Blouder City and found this little jewel of a place, loved this place so much went back the second time. The food and beverages were amazing! Exceptional customer service from Michelle and Ozzie! Milo's will see me again in June!"}
{"text":"Aaaah, Milo's Cellar.  This is one of my favorite escapes from city life.    Whenever the neon lights of Las Vegas get too bright for me, I hope in the car and drive the 20 minutes to Boulder City and feel like I'm a lifetime away from the City of Sin.    My most recent visit, I tried the Beef, Blue and Dews sandwich.  Oh my, was it tasty.  This sammich was so good that my friend who normally despises blue cheese ate half of it!    I usually get the cheese plate as well and it never disappoints - though this time I tried the artichoke Parmesan dip.  I enjoyed it, but probably won't get it again as the cheese plates are far better.    A word of caution though - beware the Sangria!  I don't drink, but the face my friend made after the first sip of the red wine sangria was so ghastly, I just had to try and see what was going on.  Now, if you are a fan of the taste of cherry cough syrup this could be the drink for you because that is exactly what it tasted like.  I did my friend a solid and used my peach iced tea to water down the thick, bitter elixer as well as I could but there really was no salvaging what was already lost.    That being said, I love this place!  I've been going here for years and will continue to do so - minus the cough syrup sangria."}
{"text":"Great by-the-glass selections.  European atmosphere.  Milo's is a wonderful place to just hang out and relax.  You can have a glass of decent wine and small bite for under $10 or \"splurge\" and have dinner.  The patio and interior are really inviting (tastefully decorated like a cellar) and our server (Melissa) was extremely friendly and helpful.  Prices, again, are reasonable.  We enjoyed the atmo so much that we actually came here twice in the same day.  Once for an appetizer (garlic dip which was all right; with a glass of petite syrah, which was quite nice) and later for a nightcap.  We each had a different kind of port and they were both really good along with a 'chocolate malt & caramel' cake which was a bit disappointing (seemed like mass produced factory fare).  Food is OK, nothing to write home about (or compliment them on Yelp for).  Come here for great wine and eat if you're hungry."}
{"text":"My vegan sandwich (um, I think it was vegan) was excellent. Hubby's rueben sandwich was weird. Still no clue what kind of meat was on it. Kinda looked like Bologna. Ok, they comped the icky Reuben."}
{"text":"Again great beer & wine selection.  It was lovely to sit at an actual sidewalk cafe & enjoy life passing by...  The food was better than average, although my potato salad tasted as if it came from a large plastic tub & was then jazzed up.  My SW Vegetarian Sandwich was tasty & fresh.  Although, the tomatoes were very unripe.  My husband enjoyed his Popeye Salad & noted that the ingredients were in perfect proportion.    I had Xingu Braziian Black Beer & I am a huge fan now.  I'd go back just for that!    Can't wait to try the cheese & meat platters with a nice bottle of vino."}
{"text":"From Maryland needed a good place to have soup and salad . Milo's did not disappoint , the mushroom soup was awesome , the Greek salad was big and delicious . They were reasonable and the service was excellent ....."}
{"text":"Milo's is fun, and has a nice selection of wine. I would have rated it 4 stars but I have 2 complaints. The Bordeaux Platter is not consistent, one week it has bread and oil and vinegar, peppers, and a nice assortment of cheese and the next week it had crackers, no peppers and skimpier on the cheese. Please be consistent. The second is the bathroom- it was just plain old dirty. Full trash bins overflowing on the floor, dirty toilet, dirty floor. It's Unisex so I don't know how they ladies stand it. It's ok for guys because guys don't really care, but chics do. A little tweaking and they will be right on target."}
{"text":"Milo 's Cellar,  538 Nevada Way, Boulder City, NV 89005. This restaurant appears to be absurdly pet friendly.   We had to lodge a complaint with an older tall lady, short brown hair with a boyish hair cut, who stated she was the shift manager, \"Ann??\" on duty 9.09.17. Complaint: A customer had placed his dogs on top of his table. The dogs proceeded to walk around the table top eating from his plate of food, the other dog was laying across the table, while the owner lifted the dogs tail and rubbed the dogs behind in a highly suspect manner.   As disgusting as it sounds, it almost appeared as animal beastialty / molestation.   The whole scene was revolting, not to mention unsanitary. The above mentioned manager served drinks to this table of miscreants and never even asked them to remove their dogs from the table tops.   Other customers had dogs sitting on the dining chairs.  Another dog lifted his leg and peed on the table leg.  The management clearly does not adhere to any real code of health or safety food handling regulations.  Serving food in this filthy vile environment is a human illness and contaminate breeding ground.  Is this a restaurant for humans or is this a dog kennel gone very wrong?"}
{"text":"Cute place on the downtown strip in boulder city. Worth the trip. Well stocked wine shop with great food and service. Had a wine flight of 3oz pours for 15 and it was great. Obviously homemade food and the quality was excellent. Recommend."}
{"text":"My wife has got sick twice here and we didn't like there food the either time. It's a shame when they have such a good location."}
{"text":"Great great great love the food had the lobster hoogie and the hummus is amazing!!! Definitely coming back everyone needs to come down!!!!"}
{"text":"Great chocolate bundt cake with ice cream and chocolate syrup. Yum! Friendly staff too."}
{"text":"Very good food (pub \"plus\" type), great selection of bottled beer (if you're not doing wine). Competing music from pizza place next door is a little loud, but sidewalk table is recommended.  Enjoyable."}
{"text":"Food is ok..not great.  had golden beet salad..so much cheese couldnt taste anything else...mostly spinach which for about $11+ is high.  i found one piece ofvred beet in entire salad and a few small chunks of golden beet around side.  thats it.  ok so we r in b.c. And its more about convenience snd atmosphere but outside seating has no smoke free zone so everyone around us was smoking..ugh..we moved inside..not the same.  if there were another place on b.c. Id recommend..but milos does ok on default  next time will wait til back in lv to eat."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch, the menu didn't have much to offer and the prices were high for what they did offer.  Mainly cold sandwiches, salads and soup.  I ordered the turkey and brie sandwich on a croissant, it wasn't very good at all although there was plenty of turkey on the sandwich it was overwhelmed with lettuce and it had a small piece of brie that didn't come close to going the length of the sandwich.  My companion ordered the Caesar Wrap and was equally unimpressed.  Side options were chips, or potato salad and a small serving of grapes were included.  The service was friendly and fast.  The food wasn't to my liking so I won't be going back.  I suppose if I was a wine drinker or more of a salad eater perhaps it would have been better.   Also while we were waiting I noticed a kitchen worker walk past the bar through the dining room with a huge bag of lettuce and disappear into what I assume was the kitchen.  I wasn't thrilled at the thought of preparatory items being hauled through the main dining area but perhaps that's just me."}
{"text":"A quaint little wine store that serves food as well!   Boulder City is the little hidden gem of Mayberry right outside of Las Vegas so stopping here seemed like a must.  They have several tables inside along with patio seating outside. We grabbed a spot outside to people watch and enjoy cooler weather.   Their menu has a huge selection of wines, lagers and cider, several cheese spreads like the one I ordered that included baked Brie, apples, grapes, fried apricots and nuts. They also have cured meat choices, big salads, carpaccio,and entrees like hearty sandwiches and the prices are reasonable.  The service was very slow but the sangria was great!"}
{"text":"A great place to stop for lunch and to have a glass of wine or beer! The service has been good and good great each time we have visited. Salads and sandwiches hit the spot and a glass of their house made sangria definitely needs to be tried! They have patio seating for the nice weather months and Boulder city is a cool place to walk around and visit!"}
{"text":"The wine was good and the price was right. When it came to ordering the food from the menu not so much. Most in our party wanted one or the other of the two pastas choices on the menu. We were told \"They were not serving either of those items tonight\"  We settled for wine, appetizers and sandwiches. On a side not... If your a bread lover you will enjoy the sandwiches , there certainly was plenty of bread to be had."}
{"text":"So I went here with the family after going on a hoover dam boat tour.  I couldn't decide what I wanted to eat because there were a few sandwiches on the menu that sounded so good. I decided to go with the Tuscany sandwich and I made the right decision.  It has Salami, pepperoni, provolone, basil pesto mayo, roasted peppers and romaine lettuce on a tomato focaccia. Im a fan of all those meats The Basil pesto mayo was just mouth watering and the bread just melted in my mouth. By far one of the best sandwiches Ive ever had. All the sandwiches are served with a pickle spear, grapes, and a choice of Lay's Potato chips, potato salad, or Terra chips.   The restaurant its self Is nicely decorated with a few different wines on display, we choice to eat outside which was a very nice experience.  The reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because the service was not so great and  there wasn't anything to accommodate my 4 year old son as far as food options."}
{"text":"Cute place, fast service, great wine selection, wonderful specials. Skip eating at the Hoover Dam cafe, and drive the 5 miles into Boulder City. Cute town!   What a gem!  The servie was spotty, but it gave me a chance to enjoy people watching, and enjoy my tablemate's company!"}
{"text":"NEXT DOOR to Milo's is a fabulous bakery you can go in the morning and have coffee, wonderful pastries from scratch, and other breakfast items. I walked in here looking for a café I couldn't find, but once Kelly described what they had I decided to have breakfast there instead. The service and food was nothing short of impeccable. And if you don't want to sit a while, stop for coffee and a croissant on your way through, it's definitely worth it. This is a place that not only has amazing food, but really cares about the experience of their customers."}
{"text":"Very interesting place.   The prices where relatively high but this place had good wine and the appetizers were tasty as well. I had a first date here, if you are in the area looking for a low key place for a date, workday happy hour, romantic setting etc I think that you can't go wrong in Boulder City with this place."}
{"text":"Great wine, Great food and cheese platter. A very nice place to escape to on a weekend. Sit on the patio and watch all the people. Its like being on a vacation, without having to drive or fly very far. I recommend for all wine lovers. They do have quite a beer selection too."}
{"text":"I love this place and frequently drive out  from extreme NW Vegas to come here and eat and relax.  This place has great service and a great atmosphere, especially in the fall and spring when dining on the small patio is great.  I have tried several different tomato soups and all were spot on. The great salad is very good although I don't care for the bacon in it as it is out of place IMO. They have several awesome sandwiches like the portabella, or the pulled pork that kick ass.  There is a great selection of wines here and some higher end beers as well which is more my speed.  My usual is the Chianti platter and I usually have them sub out some of the peppercinis and artichokes for more cheese and red peppers as you can only eat so many.  This is a great place.....i suggest trying it. I also recommend driving past it on the main drive and and turning right on Arizona I believe it is and parking there. Easier to park and leave."}
{"text":"This is our favorite place to relax and visit with friends. The service, Rob Cristo, above spectacular. We love all waitresses and the food is great.   Big choice of wine and speciality beer.  The even serve our puppies.  Bonus"}
{"text":"We stopped in Wednesday night for ladies night it.  Every table was full inside and out.  Our sever was the one who promptly greeted us then cleaned a dirty table  so we could be seated , brought us water reccomended the red sangria and spinach artichoke dip which we ordered, then  told us of the nightly special which we also ordered and it was delicious. This young lady just rocked! We never waited or needed anything. Our servers name was Aurora truly just a wonderful server we will be returning and asking for her station and will gladly wait for her to take care of us !"}
{"text":"Great little wine bar and cafe. I ordered the lobster roll (which was good but pricier than I expected. No price listed as it was on their lunch special board) and my girlfriend ordered the \"Cultured Cowboy Salad\". I also got the 3 Wine Flight for $15 bucks...super good deal. Had a Sauv Blanc, Vouvray, and a Pinot Noir...all of them delicious 3-4 oz poors. The server was also very knowledgable about the wines on the list, which is a plus since often times the only answer you can get out of a server these days when it comes to wine is \"Oh, it's good.\"   Also, this place is great because they are dog friendly. Sat down at an outside table on the covered walkway and the server brough over a dog bowl with water! Very cool."}
{"text":"I love this place. I have been a fan for years. There is nothing more relaxing than to spend a lazy summer night, on their patio, noshing on cheese and fruit and sipping a chilled beverage. The fare is not very hearty, but in the summer heat, you really do not feel like a heavy meal. There are over 50 wines and beers available for you to enjoy with your meal or you can take home a gem from their wine inventory.  You do get spill over from Tony's Pizza, next door, but everyone seems to get along well...but it can get loud, so the cool, relaxed factor for visiting friends can get a little hard.  It was not that many years ago, when the old town was falling into a boring collection of trash (antique) shops, which really is ironic in a town that wants to portray itself as an art community. Now with the City getting behind the movement with different sculptures and with new, interesting shop owners buying in on the movement, visiting Milo's is a  nice change of pace from Las Vegas"}
{"text":"What an great little place in the heart of Boulder City's downtown. This was yet another Yelp find. Stopped in on the way to check out the new bridge. It was a gorgeous day out so we were able to sit outside and dine, which is a favorite for me. We all ordered something different, and we all cleaned our plates. I had the cultered cowboy salad for $11, and it filled me up. They have a nice selection of wine and entertainment a few days a week. Next time I'm in the area, I'm coming back to try some more menu items, they have a large selection."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a bite to eat on the way to Hoover dam - loved their sandwich selection and sidewalk dining. I dont drink wine, but it looked like they had a great selection. Definitely a cute place to stop in for a quick meal, but get there early - they have limited tables outside and they filled up quickly!"}
{"text":"I like this spot. It has all the feeling of an outdoor bar/fun place to eat you would find in San Francisco .  It has great seating for those who wish to sit and watch the people go down the main drag in Boulder.  It also has a cool collection of beer you can purchase to go. I haven't tried the food ever, just the beers after a bike ride at Bootleg Canyon.  The service is great and so are the staff members...support Boulder City!"}
{"text":"Really nice setting as I enjoyed lunch with my wife.  Was very pleased with the service and was even more pleased when I saw the love and care of how they presented our food.  First bite and I was in love with this place.  I had the chicken chipotle and if your not scared of a little heat I highly recommend it.  My wife got the chicken Caesar wrap and that was really really good as well."}
{"text":"The perfect little place to stop for wine and a bite when visiting Boulder City. Good food and lots of wine choices."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Stopped in after Hoover dam.  Great salads and fresh sangria and service.  Sat inside after fighting with the bees ;)   Will definitely stop in again next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Rob is the best server! He know my drink order & always has more coming without even asking!!!  Plus, they brought the cowboy salad back...my fav!"}
{"text":"Food here is good, But don't arrive on a Harley, or god forbid you wear any kind of biker gear.  The cold shoulder treatment and attitude comes out from the servers. Shame on you Milo's. I'm giving you one star,  one star is for an Ok sandwich."}
{"text":"We had cheese appetizer and hummus both were very good. Service is fantastic and we loved the outdoor dining"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. Considering that this place is in Boulder City and there's nothing there, the food was ok. But overall, the food was under par.  Let me start by saying service was so slow. It took forever to get waters, FOREVER for our food to come out and forever to get our check. We were sitting outside and it was on the chilly side so the wait was extra excruciating. There were only 2 servers who were friendly, but it wasn't even that busy, 8 parties at most.   As for the food, like I said it was edible and we were hungry. I ordered a sandwich with turkey, cheese, tomatoes, avocado, sprouts and pickled peppers. The produce was not fresh at all. The sprouts were brown, the turkey was dry and old, the tomatoes were soggy and my side of grapes were old and ugly. And you know when you leave cheese out in room temperature and it gets soft and turns a weird color? That's what the cheese looked like. The meat in my bf's sandwich was this weird pink and brown color and the bread was stale. The best part of the meal was the pickle spear and potato salad that came with our meal.   We were just passing through Boulder City and needed a quick bite to eat. I suggest if you're doing the same, hit up the bar & grill next door."}
{"text":"When in Vegas I make it a point to come here. Wonderful selection of wines (nicely priced!), lite fare, ladies night half off all drinks on Wednesdays and for men on Fridays. Martini Monday specials too.  Service is always on point and I love the ambience. So different from the usual Vegas action. So much more relaxed small town atmosphere.  The owners and employees really take pride in what they do. It's the classiest place in Boulder City! Book a night at their Inn and request for a room facing the courtyard then visit the numerous antique stores within walking distance!"}
{"text":"Stopped in the other day when the weather was perfect for a ride on the motorcycle.  Boulder City is such a nice peaceful place, it's nice to sit down and watch the traffic go by.  We arrived for lunch and they were very busy, we had great service and the food was great, we really enjoyed the homemade bread too.   See you next time!"}
{"text":"Very nice lunch!   Sandwiches were excellent and the option to pick a wine at retail plus a $10 corkage fee is excellent.   Sounded like they had some good soups and salads - would be a nice menu addition to offer a half and half option so we could try those out too."}
{"text":"This is such a charming little wine bar.  A girlfriend and I recently went in and knocked back some wine.  The prices are very reasonable.  The food was pretty good too.  It feels like a little \"Cheers\" with all the locals that frequent this spot.  They were very friendly and welcoming.  The lady that took care of us, Talan (sorry if the spelling is wrong!) was so much fun and really made our visit enjoyable.  She takes a lot of pride in what she does!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"What an amazing little restaurant! Nestled right in the downtown Boulder City area, it's a perfect place to grab dinner. The outdoor patio was really nice, mini lights and misters provided a relaxing and cool place to have a romantic dinner.  The cheese plate was HUGE and delicious. The turkey and brie sandwich was also good, very fresh and filling. The quality of the food here is good and prices were good too. Service was prompt and the staff were all very nice."}
{"text":"Love stopping here on our road trips from AZ to rural NV . Always a nice lunch. I just wish I was not on a road trip and having to drive/ great wine options that I have not had the opportunity to try( yet)."}
{"text":"The chef has no clue about creating taste. Salmon sandwich had a load of green leaves on it with not much sauce. Was supposed to be grilled but did not seem so. The salmon wrap was even worse. The wrap seemed old. There was more lettuce leaves in it than salmon. But the ambiance is not bad if you find yourself in boulder city."}
{"text":"We had a pretty decent experience here tonight.  Our waitress, although not particularly engaging, was friendly and attentive enough.  We wished they had not stuck us in a side dining room that seemed more like an afterthought or a \"whatever\" room that they use for...storage?  It was really terrible to have to sit there.   Empty, quiet, alone, no ambiance.    Drinks were good, our food was good to very good.  Favorite dishes were the caprese and ahi tuna.  Other dishes were the chicken wrap, salmon, and spinach artichoke dip.  We were least impressed with the dip but it was still decent.  I was really surprised at how expensive the appetizers were, many were $12+.  I wish the prices were more in line with the actual dish and quantity received, as you could spend $50 on three appetizers if you're not careful.    Still, we had an alright experience and would consider returning.   The staff seemed friendly enough."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite places but I'll never go back due to the TERRIBLE service.  The wait staff is clueless.  Customer service is terrible .  The food was good a few years ago but recently food quality has declined.  The wine list is extremely overpriced.  Save yourself the bad experience.  There are plenty of other good places to eat in BC. This isn't one of them."}
{"text":"Cowboy Salad was shockingly the epitome of \"cowboy.\" The bacon had a ton of flavor and the BBQ Ranch dressing was just enough of a western touch. Sangria packed a serious punch too. Definitely a place to check out if you're in the Boulder City/Las Vegas area."}
{"text":"We stopped here after hiking 8 miles on the Historic Railroad Trail.  We got there around 1:30 pm or so & the lunch crowd was pretty much gone.  Because I am short & I was tired, the waitress showed us to a nice table that was not bar height.  She gave us the wine specials & the lunch special.  I tried the wine special, it was a very nice sparkling white wine.  We ordered the Ahi Tartare & the roasted beet salad.  Both items were delicious & it was a nice lunch.  I would recommend this shop to anyone!!  Great food & great service!"}
{"text":"This place continues to deliver amazing food and drink. They have a great selection of wines, and the menu has a decent selection of salads, cheese platters, sandwiches and wraps as well as some deserts.  Our server was Amy and she was one of the BEST servers I have ever had. She had several tables she was taking care of yet she was able to make us feel like we were the only table there which she seemed to do with every table.  She takes the time to talk to you, she makes you feel welcome and creates an environment you can relax and enjoy yourself in.  Overall, I have never had anything on the menu that I did not like or had an issue with.  They take pride in creating healthy tasting dishes that are freshly made.  I highly recommend this place, it is worth whatever drive you have to make to get here. Lucky for me it's not that far and we LOVE this place."}
{"text":"Have to recommend this B&B to anyone visiting Boulder City. The staff is more than accommodating and friendly. The rooms are adorable and unique. The included breakfast is served at your door and in a lovely setting on the balcony where the pond and fountain splash in the background. Highly recommend. Worth the price!"}
{"text":"Gracious service, but the lunch for all of us was just fair. The Euro sandwich, while tasty, came on a stale croissant, a big deal breaker. The best part was the decor - being surrounded by hundreds of bottles of wine!"}
{"text":"I went here with friends because I was told it is a great European dining experience.  The hostess was so rude, she would not seat us outside because we had 4 in our party and the 4 tops were full, so the 3-seaters she would not let us pull up a chair, so she told us to go inside.  The tables inside are super high and seat 2, so we wandered into their other dining area and found a table for 4. She said we can't sit in the area for whatever reason, so we went back outside and tried to sit at a table for 3 and she said she cold not seat us there since we had 4!!!  So we decided \"European experience\" meant pretentious and rude.  Heck, this is Boulder City!!!  We just wanted to eat a good meal at 1:30 PM after a full day at the Dam.  So we left and went somewhere else.  Growing up in the service industry, I was just really surprised by this - the restaurant was not that full and now they will not have our business."}
{"text":"Loved, Loved Loved this place!!!       We were staying at the Boulder Dam Hotel and enjoyed the little town of Boulder City.   We enjoy wine and wineries so a restaurant with a wine-centered attitude was perfect for us!     The girl behind the wine bar was great-super, super nice!!!  So was the gentleman who served us.    We started with a wine flight.  He picked the wines for us based on our preference and did a great job!   We tried two cabs and a sangiovese.  The pours in the wine flight were the biggest you will ever see!  3-4oz each glass.       For dinner we split one of thier salads--it was awesome (you have to picture me saying it with a high \"awe\" and a lower \"some--like the guy in Who Met you Mother would say it).   It was huge!!!   The server said that the kitchen seems to make them  bigger for split orders--take note!   The way the menu works is that there are a lot of sandwiches, salads and cheese plates to choose from.  For specials they have a couple of flatbread pizzas and one entree.   This evening it was a lamb shank.   Very good!   It was tender and fell off of the bone!   The sauce was some kind of a red wine reduction I think and it was perfect!    The lamb shank came with with a very generous portion of garlic potatos.  I don't exactly remember the prices but I think that the wine flight was $12, the salad was about $12, the lamb shank was $17 and a glass of port after the meal was $6."}
{"text":"While my brother and I were waiting for my Skydiving DVD to be created, we decided to get some food in Boulder City. I must say that I really like the area. It has that old town vibe and nice street dining.  At the recommendation of one of the Skydive Las Vegas crew and one of my skydive meetup group members, we headed for Milo's. It was a great choice.  I opted for the Sunday special, which was Lamb Shanks. My brother went with the Southwestern Vegetarian Wrap. He described it as having a nice peppery ranch sauce that was flavorful, while not overpowering the taste of the earthy vegetables. Also, the avocado in the wrap had a good texture i.e. not too mushy. He sounds like a better Yelper than me.  My Lamb Shank dish exceeded my expectations. I went with a raspberry vinaigrette dressing for my salad. It was very flavorful and the perfect amount of dressing for the salad size. The dish also came with a couple of bread sticks and some vinaigrette/EVOO for dipping. As for the lamb, it was perfectly cooked - tender on the inside and very tasty. I thought the wine sauce was a tad strong, but not bad by any stretch. It complemented the lamb and mashed potatoes very nicely.  For dessert, my brother decided to order the cheesecake. I had some of it and it was pretty good. Definitely a good way to end the meal.  Some of the reviews mention slow service. Our server was very attentive and friendly. I also like their credit card system. He brought it out to our table and swiped my card right there. It even has an automatic tip system. Having to forgo the math is always a plus.  Incidentally, they have a great beer selection. Monty Python's Holy Grail Ale anyone? Too bad they don't have anything on tap.  Great location. Great street dining. This place gets my approval."}
{"text":"As Boulder City locals...we go here often. Great food. Great,caring service. Great wine selections.  . . . And the owner sails Hobie cats!. In the desert!"}
{"text":"Only good thing here now is the wine. The food is horrible. Have been back 2x since my original review and sadly it was terrible both times. Dont waste your money!"}
{"text":"Ozzie was The most amazing waiter I have had in the longest time!! Milo's is lucky to have him!  Wine was great , food and cocktails were amazing. Thanks for a great end of the day!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Milo's about 5 times.  The first few times were solid 4-star experiences, but the last couple of visits haven't been so good.  The sandwiches are fresh, and I like how they come with grapes.  The different wine-themed platters are huge for their price.  All in all, the food goes quite well with wine.  The prices on wine are really good if you get one of their featured bottles.  The last couple of visits were on weekend nights when they were fairly busy, and the service was SLOW.  I know that it's hard to be efficient when a restaurant is busy, but this place has maybe 20 tables, a few of which were open, and there were 4 servers working.  Last night we ordered a bottle of wine and a couple of sandwiches, having waited nearly 15 minutes for the server to come around for our order. After another 15 minutes we finally got our wine, and then the food came literally 30 minutes after that.  The food was okay, but I was given the potato salad instead of the side that I had ordered.  After we had finished the meal and our bottle of wine, our barely-present server at least had the dignity to quickly deliver our check without making eye contact, because she clearly knew what was coming to her:  a crappy tip."}
{"text":"Milo's continues to be one of my very favorite places to enjoy a glass of wine or have a tasty sandwich. Chef Magdi has added a number of delectable offerings to match the extensive and sophisticated wine list.   As a Boulder City resident, I also appreciate how much  owner Milo Hurst has been a champion for the arts on our town. In 2015 another addition to Milo's has been the Art Space in the cellar. Every few months a new artist or artists are featured.  The art is curated from among local talent, is of high quality, and all of it is for sale!   Local art is also supported by Milo's directly. It is the location of BC's local Dr Sketchy's chapter - a life drawing \"anti-art school\" where artists gather to sketch from a live (clothed) model every 1st Tuesday of the month from 7-9:30pm."}
{"text":"The raps are amazing! Nice atmosphere and good service We didn't have any thing to drink this time but it seemed like a good place to do so!"}
{"text":"It was ok. Food was good, but nothing special. I don't understand what all the hype is about."}
{"text":"Pretty good little place, sometime the wait is a bit long and the food is kind of pricey but it is rather romantic and upscale. Good for something unique and really out of the ordinary, I like wine and small plates of food so this place works for me."}
{"text":"What a great find for a traveler passing through!  We had a lovely meal of salmon topped with crab and lobster in a delicious cream sauce.  Beautiful presentation on a bed of delicious mushroom rice with perfectly cooked young carrots and peas.  Fresh green salad started us off and the meal special included a delicious house red or white wine.  I had chardonnay and it was perfect.  Our waitress, Amy, was very efficient, friendly, and just the right amount of attention!  The special was very reasonably priced at $20.  If we lived here, this restaurant would be on our frequent restaurant list.  Go!  Eat!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Excellent ambiance next to the raucous place next door. A little slice of European decor. Food was excellent as well as the salad. Best place in boulder city"}
{"text":"I love visiting milos for their lunch and amazing wine selection.   The staff is always so friendly. & I love that it's dog friendly too!"}
{"text":"If you're a vegetarian this may not be the place for you. They have an ok selection of salads and sandwiches. The tables inside are very small so sitting outside might be a better option. The service was good. I'm honestly not sure if I would return. I didn't love it or hate it."}
{"text":"03/28/11 DRINKS.   This is a tough one. I had a martini, spouse had the white sangria, both really nice. BUT then we purchased 2 bottles of wine from the wine store, took them home, opened the white that night, and it was COOKED BEYOND BELIEF. And I noticed, while there, that alot of the wines on the \"by the glass\" list are not stocked in the wine store. So they're selling cooked wines in the store, offering not very interesting wines by the glass. A sad situation. I won't go back, unless they get a refurb. GREAT SERVER, tho! She was a sweetheart. I feel for her."}
{"text":"I read the reviews and wanted to love this restaurant.   The waitress was really nice and very attentive.  The first thing to come out was the bread. It was very stale and hard as a rock.  At the bottom of the bread basket were 2 paper rings that hold silverware and napkins together from some previous diners. We ordered a second basket of bread and it was harder and more stale than the first.  (And were not talking it was just nice and crispy, it was 2 day old stale.) I ordered a house salad,  it looked great but it had an odd smell to it,  like it was in a refrigerator next to something and it picked up a smell.  I took a couple of bites and left it.  My friend had French onion soup and loved it,  though.  2 minutes after they brought the soup and salad,  our entrees arrived, they were ok.  Talk about rushed though,  wow.  All in all,  I had such a great time and conversation with my friends I just overlooked the food.  I will probably go back there,  but stick with their sandwich menu.  It looked amazing."}
{"text":"Great service, great server! Nice place overall, drinks came quickly. Server was super nice. Prices are reasonable. Come here if you ever visit Boulder City."}
{"text":"Ok i didnt try the wine, so i cannot Judge on that... we came back from hoover dam, and the little city is so nice.. it reminds me of the movies of america back in the 50s... it was a little rock n roll town.... so we wanted to grab a drink on a terrace in that town.. the waitress was a really nice girl, very friendly.. i wanted to try something different as they had different sorts of tee's... i tried some bottles ice tee raspberry i think it was.. the waitress recommended it too me.. well im not a fan.. i didnt like it it wasnt sweet and ive put 4 bags of Sucre in the bottle haha.. but thats my personal taste.. i wish i wouldve tried a wine but it was too early for me for that.. but overall the place is really nice, nicely decorated, clean toilets which is important to me, at a very nice cozy location... just dont take the bottled ice tee if you like really sweet drinks!! the waitress once again, really nice... 5 stars for her.."}
{"text":"Got a great table in the corner for Mother's Day and a fun wine called \"Mother's Milk\" to drink!  Great service, unforgettable salad."}
{"text":"Second time here (Mother's Day), really tasty food and nice atmosphere, surprisingly speedy service considering the holiday today."}
{"text":"Been here several times, despite the fact it's about a 25 minute drive from our house.  It's more fun when the weather is nicer and you can sit outside, although we have sat inside before.  Inside is a little too crowded for my taste, it has the bar and the wine shop in there, although with a few tall tables.  So, I prefer outside.  We always get one of the \"cellar platters\" to start, which is charcuterie.  These are very reasonably priced, and you get quite a bit for $11-$14.  I've had the beef blue and dews, Milo's cheesesteak, at least a half dozen times.  I could eat 2 of these sandwiches in one sitting.  Garlic mayo, blue cheese, and peppadew peppers on the same sandwich are fantastic, but then add beef.  It's a very solid version of the classic dish.  My wife has had the Parisian, which is a solid sandwich with turkey, brie, and sprouts.  But, in my opinion, the dish to order is the BBD.  Then, order another to take home.  Very good wine list, with several selections by the glass.  Of course, you can buy in the store and immediately drink.  The mark up is not nearly what it is at most places, so this is a great option."}
{"text":"Awesome little spot on Main Street. They have great food and my coworkers enjoyed their wine list. I've heard that the inn connected to it is very nice and romantic. Never been, but will make a point of it one day. Definitely a place that visitors to Boulder City should try out!"}
{"text":"We have been here countless times and will continue to do so but did something different this time, we got a room upstairs. It was spectacular, took a bottle of wine up and sat by the firepit and looked at the stars while all the time listened to the rain waterfall. This is really a GREAT place to escape to. I will highly recommend  this hidden gem, and the food is superb!"}
{"text":"Wow in Boulder City Milo's Cellar a wine connaisseurs delight great service great presentation and taste great what a find! 98 pets with 2014 Opolo Mountain Zinfandel"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here on a Friday night in the summer of 2015. We took seats outside and enjoyed the home town ambiance and activity of downtown Boulder city. The staff was really attentive and friendly. We ordered a Mediterranean platter which included cheeses, meats, artichoke hearts, roasted peppers, and olives. It was served with artisan bread and yuppie vinegar and oil. It was amazing. We then split a thinly sliced beef sandwich with au jus. Again, amazing.  The menu is mostly appetizers sandwiches salads and soup. No real dinner entrees. But, who cares. When the food is this good, there is nothing wrong with splitting appetizers and salads. Half of the menu is alcohol, as they feature a wide variety of wines and imported beer. For me one of the great things about eating at Milos is taking a walk around downtown Boulder city and enjoying the local statues and markers. I highly recommend this little gem of a restaurant as a date night destination or just a great get away from Las Vegas."}
{"text":"If you are tired expensive meal in Vegas, try to stop by Boulder city for this cozy restaurant/hotel place. The dinning atmosphere is great, food is delicious and price is right. Staffs are very courteous and owner himself is a truly nice person, too."}
{"text":"Located about a half hour drive outside of Vegas (depending on what part of Vegas of course), this is a great place to come if you want to get out of the Vegas rat race and experience a bit of small town Nevada life but still have a good selection of wine andor beer.  I think sitting outside on a relaxing Sunday afternoon when the weather is nice is the best way to experience Milo's."}
{"text":"Best little eatery in history boulder city. Our server noticed how exhausted we were after doing the hot springs hike in 110 degree weather. Brought us lots of water and a nice bucket with wet towels. Amazing wine selection. Good food. And a cute interior. I had one of their platters that you pair with wine. Amazing."}
{"text":"I love, love, love Milo's. The absolute best wine selection for a Chardonnay lover like me. The Chianti appetizer is a must. The lobster roll rivals any roll that I have had in Maine. French onion soup is delicious.  I'm a huge fan of Milo's!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and perfect for lunch. We are outside and our waiter was very nice and helpful. I would definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So, I decided to take a stroll over to Boulder City today instead of dining in Hendertucky. Milos had decent reviews so my girlfriend and I decided to check it out.  When we arrived, we were impressed by the atmosphere and the patio seating. Once we were served, my optimism changed. The waitress grabbed me a beer that I did not order which is a tiny mistake. When I asked about the Beaujolais platter, she corrected me in an impolite manner and she still was saying it wrong. She said it came with bread and it didn't... And finally, she didn't even put my sandwich order in because she probably was all excited to show me the incorrect pronunciation for the Beaujolais. Food and wine were decent but a tad overpriced. We can definitely check Milo's off the places to never return to. At least the motorbike ride was refreshing!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant and service.  Plus, I found a McManis Syrah  red wine that I absolutely love!  Thanks you Milo's Cellar.  P.S.....we sat inside, right in the middle of the wine shop, with lovely air conditioning on a hot July evening!"}
{"text":"Great cozy place. Everyone so friendly, if you like wine, try their wine flight. I did 3 reds & loved them all. We will be back for the food, but they already won me over with the wine:)"}
{"text":"Came to Milo's looking for some food because we were told they had nice soups and salads.  We got to the front door and was told a thirty minute wait.  all good.  Asked them to put our name on the list and was told no list.  fine.  Said we will walk around a bit and shop be back in a little bit and was told good luck with that.  If we get back they might have a seat for us but we would have to be very lucky."}
{"text":"Great food, big surprise!   After a bad experience in Las Vegas at Mario Batali's restaurant , it was nice to eat well unexpectedly ."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went for a leisurely tour of Boulder City. Around dinner time we started looking for a place to eat while we walked around the scenic downtown area. We saw numerous burger joints, but we had burgers for lunch so we weren't in the mood. We came across Milo's and read the menu. The Athenian (croissant sandwich with Brie and sprouts) sounded amazing so I jumped at the idea.  When we decided to sit and eat, the outdoor seating was full and there appeared to be only one open seat front and center to some live guitar music. We were looking for something a bit quieter so we could talk and lucked out because their was seating in the cellar area. It was nice and quaint with some very nice prints on the wall beside our table.  So I ended up ordering the Athenian and my girlfriend got a sandwich, with a name I don't remember, on ciabatta bread with chipotle mayo and sprouts. Both sandwiches were good. We both had half of each. My only negative comment was that the croissant and ciabatta were not fresh. It seemed more tolerable that the ciabatta was not fresh, but I feel the croissant could have been so much better. Maybe if it was at least just warmed a bit.  Additionally we each got a glass of wine. I got a decent Pinot Grigio and she got a wonderful Moscato. The price point was reasonable and their did not appear to be a dress code, which was great considering I was in flip flops and workout shorts. In all I really enjoyed the place, which was a more than pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"Enjoyed lunch there two different times with friends. I'm a larger person so the chairs outside feel not so sturdy. The next time we were seated in the back room. The food was great and the servers were nice. My other friends loved these cheese and wine. I enjoyed soda."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Milo's in ages, but that might have to change soon.  I used to go every Thursday night after dance classes.  My girls and I would go and enjoy a glass or three of wine and beer, and soups and sandwiches.   I always always got the Pollo Bello wrap, which was chicken, and portobello mushrooms.  The quality has consistantly been awesome.    I've never had a soup I didn't like. :D  If Milo's was closer to where I live, I'd be there all the time."}
{"text":"We just stopped here for lunch, but did appreciate a very nice meal, atmosphere and service. My partner and I had the soup of the day, and split their French Kiss, roast beef, sandwich. Both were very good, highlighted by the wonderful bread they served.  Decent beer selection in-spite of being a wine bar."}
{"text":"This place is really cute, and a breath of fresh air after the glitz (and high prices) of Vegas. Three of us had a delightful lunch, including an appetizer and a glass of wine for me, for just over $30, tip included. Try that in Vegas!  There are several choices for vegetarians. I had the southwest vegetarian sandwich and my companions had salads. The brie plate was delicious as well, and the bread they serve with the soups and cheese plates is excellent as well.  There was easy parking, and Milo's had a nice and attentive staff, too."}
{"text":"Three of us stopped for dinner before heading to Club Fortune.  It was a little too cold to sit outside, so we sat inside.  The service was very good- our waitress was knowledgable and attentive.  We enjoyed freshly baked bread with dipping oil and a delicious salad. I'll definitely return when I can sit outside.  There are a lot of shops within walking distance- I'll allow more time on my next visit."}
{"text":"Food wasn't bad. Sandwich flavor was good. Loved the bread. Went for an early lunch on a weekday. Service out of the kitchen was slow. Especially considering we were one of two tables. The piece of chicken to bread ratio wasn't the best. Loved the veggie chips."}
{"text":"This place is great. It was recommended by a local and I decided to hit it up. I had the Italian Dip (like a French Dip but with onions and portabello mushrooms) and a glass of pinot noir.  The sandwich is served with potato salad (or chips), a pickle, au jus, and grapes. It was delicious. The wine was also very good.  Inside they have a cool little bar where you can site and enjoy the wine selection. There is also a patio that had a few groups enjoying their dinner and wine.  I would recommend this for sure."}
{"text":"We were overnite in Boulder City. Having arrived late, asked the desk clerk for recommendations. He recommended this place and the place next door (Jack's Place I think.)  We likely would have chosen Jack's if it were not for the LOUD music and the preponderance of bikers.  It looked like a fun place.  So - we went to the serene Milo's.  My husband didn't like his sandwich (La Parisian, I think.) or glass of wine (they do not have a full bar) but I enjoyed my Athenian with Chicken and loved the Sangria -  undoubtedly, the best I've ever had!!  Alas, they wouldn't give me a hint at the recipe."}
{"text":"Always love Milo's. The wine selection is incredible. And the ladies night deals are awesome!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and amazing staff.   Big wine selection.   They can accommodate bigger groups well and are always friendly.   It's a place to stay classy before you walk across the street to the Backstop to get rowdy."}
{"text":"Awesome wine, cute atmosphere, outside seating, good food. We all were happy and we all liked it.  See pix"}
{"text":"First things the bio says not good for kids.  I guess it all depends on the behavior of your child.  We came here with three adults and three girls two 5 years old and one 6 years old.  We sat outside since the weather was beautiful.  They may not have a children's menu but they were very accomodating to satisfy the little ones.  We requested chicken which was grilled and they gave grapes and chips plus a pizza for the other two girls to share.  Us adult girls enjoyed wine, Roasted Garlic Spread for an appetizer and the three us got the Cultured Cowboy Salad which is one of the best salads I have had in a long time.  The flavor was delicious.  The service, the food and the ambiance was excellent.  I will come back again."}
{"text":"This was one of my very first reviews, and the place still holds a special place for me all these years later.  I'd say not much has changed, but \"Milo's Wine Bar\" has become \"Milo's Cellar\".  The menu selection has expanded past the original (but still all there) salad and sandwich fare, and the soups....  I'm calling a \"time out\" on this review for a moment:  Get the soup.  No matter what day it is, or what selection it is.  Get the soup.  Three years later, every variety and flavor that I have ever tried are delicious.  The worst decision made is when they offer two types of soups because I know that after I have my say, a single tear will roll down my cheek for \"the other soup that could have been\". :(  Back to the rest of the review, they have daily specials, which are excellent.  Their \"Zin Chili\" is to die for (I know, back to the soups), and they're really done some great things to expand their menu and keep things fresh.  For the wine connoisseur, their selection is excellent, varied, and affordable.  I've walked away many a time with a new bottle in tow, which makes for an excellent souvenir of the experience.   Consistency wise, the place still looks the same, and the service is friendly, welcoming, and good.  I will say, however, that sometimes, even during a not so busy time, they will recognize/acknowledge you as they pass, but not close out the table when it's obvious that you're done.  When the plates are pushed away or gone, the credit card is on the edge of the table, and you're head tracking the server as they pass by for a few minutes, that's likely a good sign people are ready to go.  Fortunately, it's a minor problem that can be easily remedied, but it unfortunately has happened to us more than once, and it takes a little wind out of the sails of an otherwise enjoyable experience.    But it's a very minor issue and does nothing to dissuade my overall enjoyment of this place.  It's great food.  The people are super nice even if there is an occasional hiccup, and the whole feel of the dining experience and surrounding area is intimate and wonderful.  I make it a point to bring friends and family here, and it's always raved about.  Understandably so.  Their food and wine is excellent, and don't even get me started on the whole soup thing again.   Need a date place away from all the casino craziness of the Strip?  This is my top personal recommendation.  And go at night.  The day experience is enjoyable, but walking out of the restaurant into the quiet nights of Boulder City definitely makes for a memorable experience."}
{"text":"Average food. The Chianti meat platter was a huge let down. Pre packaged salami and horribly flavorless cheese. The house chili was greasy and bland. The salads we ordered (cowboy and buffalo chicken) were surprisingly good. Service was good as well. Wouldn't go back but wouldn't stay away either."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are good, and they have Australian beer here - unbelievable! Not Fosters - we wouldn't give that to our dog; the marketing people are outright liars; people just don't drink it. It's Coopers from Adelaide, which is a great beer. Riet's so excited she has two. I've sworn off drinking for a bit.  The people here are astonishingly polite. If you spoke to a stranger at home this way, they would think you are crazy or drunk.  We got out of Vegas with some radical, slightly illegal manouevres. We arrive in Boulder city which I think is beautiful, but Riet disagrees."}
{"text":"I love Milo's!  Downtown Boulder City is cute in itself, but a locally owned business like this is icing on the cake!  It is a wine shop, cafe and bar with an adorable patio out front.  In the summer months, the misters get a little bit out of control, but it's the idea that counts! :)  Tables fill up quickly, so be prepared to wait.  Cruise the bottles for sale and pick something out to enjoy once you get seated.  They also have a great beer selection and an extensive list of martini's - which are only $6.50 on \"Martini Mondays.\"  The food is decent.  Most recently I had the Italian dip, which was a french dip sandwich with the addition of swiss cheese and mushrooms.  The only thing that bothers me about the menu is the side choices.  They don't do fries, so you choose between potato chips, potato salad, or cabbage salad.  The service is super friendly.  This is a great stop if you are heading to/from the Dam, or just on a scenic drive on the weekend.  The patio is the best place to watch the tourists go by!"}
{"text":"Such a cute little place in Boulder.  Whenever I go here I forget that I'm only 30 minutes from all the Vegas craziness.  The food is amazing!! I have never had a bad meal.  Definitely worth checking out"}
{"text":"Food, wine and atmosphere are fantastic. Great little find to wind down after touring Hoover Dam."}
{"text":"I love sitting outside on the patio and having a flight of wine. This place is my favorite place in Boulder City by far! Looking for good wine? This place has it! oh, and you can buy bottles of wine at the restaurant! over 100 to choose from."}
{"text":"I heart Milo's big time.  93% of the time I/we stop in here after a rigorous workout down at Boulder Beach.  Normally I order the chicken/portobello sandwich.  Yesterday I was dining with one of my triathlete pals and she suggested we split a sandwich and a salad.  We both were starved so I ordered up their brie appetizer platter which is totally yummy.  In just a matter of minutes the brie platter arrived and the brie was perfectly melted.    Bonus points for the special request for sharing the greek salad and sandwich. We just expected the two entree's on two plates but instead they actually split everything up into a total of four plates.  The serving size seemed hardly half/half.  More like we each got about a 82% portion of a regular entree.    With the appetizer, two iced teas that were regularly filled and the entree's our bill only came to $42.  Great service and they usually have cute gals as servers.  I always feel like everyone values my opinion so I recommended there needed to be a shaded area in back with free hammocks for a post-lunch nap.  They appreciated my opinion. hahahahahah"}
{"text":"Absolutely one of our favorite places to eat at when going to Boulder City for years now. Its a small place with seating outside as well. Seems like we are always wanting the same appetizers when we go because they are amazing! We are not big on Hummus but let me tell you their Bruschetta Hummus is the BOMB! We LOVE IT!!! It is really the best and since we have tried it here and love it have not been able to find anywhere that makes it anywhere near as good as theirs is! They have a few other appetizers we have tried that are really good too but this one is our all time favorite. We also love the Garlic dip served with crackers. So delicious!!   If your looking for a great wine selection they have it for sure! The food we have had here from salads, to sandwiches we have tried numerous dishes that are just so good.  We have always had great service when we come here. Over all we highly recommend this place! So worth the drive just to come eat from Vegas if you want to get out of the city for a little while. We Love this place and have told many of our friends to try it out!"}
{"text":"This is a charming little restaurant we found quite by accident after leaving Las Vegas for Lake Mead.  It was a beautiful Monday night and the outdoor cafe was packed!  Friendly staff, good service, good food!  Terrific wine and cocktail service."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice and is very refreshing during the hot summer. The food is very good and I would come again for the sandwiches. I split an Italian and Avocado Chicken also got the potato salad and liked it a lot."}
{"text":"After long day boating stopped in for there great sangria. Rob is usually our server whom we love but aurora took care of us this time. Gteat service now we have 2 servers whom we will have take care of us . if ur in town go to milos and try the sangria"}
{"text":"Nice find while browsing Boulder Old Town. Attentive staff, and a unique menu. Good food."}
{"text":"We stopped in to have dinner, it was all delicious, the service by Courtney was outstanding. I had the daily special on Thursday which was lasagna with very tasty  garlic bread and a salad with a glass of house red wine. My wife had the French kiss sandwich with couscous and red wine. She loved it! It was so delicious I forgot to take a picture before digging in! I mentioned to Courtney to please let Chris (the Chef) know how great everything was; and she told me she would. We both highly recommend this place! You will not be disappointed."}
