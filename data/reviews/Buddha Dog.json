{"text":"Fancy locavore hot dogs served in a warm but modern space covered with rough wood plank walls and maps showing where their ingredients are sourced.

Basic dog costs $2 and then you add cheese (choice of three) and sauce (a dozen or so) for another quarter each. The dogs are tiny, so you'll need to get at least two (if not several more) to make a meal, but it allows you to try a bunch. It's a relatively good deal.

I like this place's ideological bent, but they also make a tasty product. The flavors of the meat and bun weren't exactly what I expected for a gourmet hot dog/sausage, which to me follows a more hearty and traditional/European approach (see Rosamunde in San Francisco, CA). The bun has a muffin-quality to it, and the meat is a little too precious in its small casing...but my bias aside, it's still a very good dog.

Oh, and I wish they would add fresh french fries...it would make for a perfect pairing."}
{"text":"Hotdogs made with organic meat from local Ontario farms coupled with fresh buns from a local bakery.  These are not your typical street-corner dogs.  Choose from a variety of homemade sauces and local cheeses.  My favourite combo is the sweet chili sauce and brie.

Restaurant is in the heart of Roncesvalles village, a fun neighborhood with tons of local delis, pubs and shops.  The place itself is comfortable, but the room is a bit too large to actually feel cozy.

If you love hotdogs, but don't like the guilt that comes along with eating them, then Buddha Dog is bliss."}
{"text":"No lips and arseholes here! (At least not in the hotdogs...). Their dogs are made of 100% aged prince edward county beef and fresh baked buns and award winning cheeses, and, and, and, so much stuff to put on them!

Spicy jerk, garlic aioli, cherry ketchup, red pepper jelly, or basic ketchup, mustard, relish if you like. 

The even greater thing though about this place is that it's kinda fancy for a hotdog place but a dog with cheese and sauce will cost you only $3! So it's cheap, it tastes like junk food, but really? It's just hot dogs without the dodgy bits. 

Mmmmmm.......meat."}
{"text":"Slow food hot dogs? Well, as a fan of the Southern Connecticut style (deep fried, crispy casing) hot dog and old school road food, I went to Buddha Dog interested but skeptical. I went with my family, including my 4 and 7 year old girls and my sometimes not easy to please Moira. We all loved it. From the funny lookin' little dogs on their homemade buns, to the 12? or more different sauces, mustards and ketchups available, the place almost begs to be found too much, but as Billy Idol once said, \"Too much is never enough.\" He could of said it about Buddha Dog. The cool space, designed with recovered local materials and the use of season and local ingredients make this a unique addition to the local color here in Toronto."}
