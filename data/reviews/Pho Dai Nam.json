{"text":"One of my favourite places. Everything is delicious (that I and everyone I've ever brought there have tried anyhow) and the portions are HUGE. Prices are great. Owners are lovely."}
{"text":"The pho here is always delicious and fresh. Me and the misses usually get the special pho bowl and the vermicelli shrimp and pork roll. The quality is always consistent. Great cheap eats place and satisfies our craving for pho. It's the broth that does it. Soo good.  Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"chicken wings were pretty good, so was the pho.
however, the pho probably had too much msg"}
{"text":"Great place. Anytime I visit my mom's place in Scarborough I make sure to stop in for a soup to go. I especially love the yellow or green curry, but be warned when ordering the thai green curry, IT'S REALLY SPICY! Service is really fast and friendly, and there's a huge variety on the menu. They're generous with the chicken and all the ingredients taste really fresh. The place has been steadily gaining a clientele over the years... go once and you'll probably be coming back again and again. A refreshing change from the slew of half-assed pho joints out there. Even the generic chinese food (chicken fried rice, lemon chicken, pad thai, etc) seems to be a cut better in this place, but for the same price. Try the Shrimp Fried Rice and wonder how you ever ate Manchu Wok before. Definitely a gem that's going to be around for ages."}
{"text":"More like Pho Dai-mazing!!!! 

I live right down the street and eat here at least once a week. Never ever have a had a bad meal here. 
Awesome fresh salad rolls with shrimp. 
The rare beef pho is large in portion and big on taste. 
But the real gem here ( yeah yeah its not really vietnamese) is the chicken wings. I don't know what the batter is but they always fry up golden and crispy while not being greasy. And the flavour? Oh lawd the flavour is the bomb. I highly recommend this place for lunch or dinner or even a quick take out. My wife and I eat here for $20 with lots of leftovers for the next day!"}
{"text":"My wife and her family have been coming here for many years now, and now I'm hooked. If you like Vietnamese, you'll love this place.

What I regularly order is the beef or pork vermicelli with spring rolls. The meat is well seasoned, and the handmade spring rolls provide the satisfying crunch to the meal.

Another thing I order, which isn't on the menu BTW, is the lemon chicken. It is amazing. Deep fried chicken pieces (don't worry, not the frozen crap) surrounded by a wonderfully gooey lemon/lime sauce. I get it with a side of noodles. Great on its own, or as a item to share with the table.

For drinks, I usually only have their green tea. Their iced coffee is good, as well as their mango milkshake.

Everything is well priced. The place is clean, service is prompt, and its never empty. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I've lived near this restaurant for seven years and my husband and I finally tried it this summer. We really liked it and were sorry that we waited so long. 

We bought takeout both times and it was ready quickly. We ended up having enough food  to feed us for 2-3 days. 

So far, we've especially enjoyed the green chicken curry, the pad thai and the beef and chicken pho."}
{"text":"I just went there because I had a cold and wanted something warm to have. So I ended up taking a scroll to Pho Dai Nam. 

The food is really good, soothing and filling but the only thing that could make the restaurant better is customer service. After I got my large special beef pho, they didn't drop by and ask if I needed anything or how the food was. But in the end, it's the food that counts and I had a nice time."}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch after being slightly hungover the night before. They give complimentary herbal tea which was whey I needed. We ordered the saut√©ed beef pho but we had to order another dish because they have a 5 dollar min per person on orders. We ordered the green curry with chicken but they didn't have so we tried the yellow. It was perfect. The soup was so filling and the beef was thinly sliced and cooked well. The large was a good size for two people. The yellow curry tasted a bit like dahl but it was scrumptious. The bill was about 15 dollars and the quality and quantity made it feel like it was triple that price. Would definitely return! It's in a plaza so you will find lots of parking but it is busy on a weekend. The young man and woman working there were very nice. Craving this right now!"}
{"text":"This is the closest pho place to my house, so it's where I go when I get random pho cravings (usually twice a month).
I usually get the house special and the soup is amazing. It is a bit oily though, and they probably use a bit too much MSG..
I wish they would be a bit more generous with their meat portions though,  especially the beef balls (they actually only give you 1)

The place is on the corner of a dingy strip plaza and usually empty when I go. Usually spend about ten bucks including tip! The waitresses just do their job and don't initiate small talk. 

Overall a decent dining experience."}
{"text":"This little place serves delicious Vietnamese - Thai food ALL THE TIME! The service s always very attentive, and prices very reasonable. Some of my favourites:
Mango Fish -imagine a whole fish (sans head) deep fried until it is just perfectly crisp yet tender, garnished with delicious slivers of mango and smothered in a delightfully balanced fish sauce/ lime juice/sugar/pepper blend.
Tom yum soup hits all the right notes of salty/sour/sweet/spicy that is the foundation of Thai cuisine.
The house special fried rice s a meal in itself, packed with tasty bits of smoked pork, sausage, shrimp, chicken veggies and scrambled egg!
Pad Thai is made the authentic way, using tamarind sauce not ketchup.
The beef salad s deliciously fresh and filling.
The grilled meat, salad and vermicelli bowls won't break the bank and don't skimp on the Protein. Add some spring rolls and you will be hooked!
If you order a day ahead, they also make deep fried lobster with green onions and ginger that will make your mouth water."}
{"text":"Good virmicelli. Simple and fast service. Can be a little hard to find out even in the right plaza. Look under the shade across the cibc bank

Menus are complete. The place is very nice and lit. The side sauces are also complete."}
{"text":"After work I took my Girl(Rusty Subaru) out for dinner but she was complaining to me on our way there @@ how she was running low on energy, so I rushed to the nearest Gas Station to fill-her-up on some cheap stuff(Basic unlead) while I looked for something to eat on my own. (Eventually every Yelper would start off a review in this format.  \"I took my SO/GF/BF....\"  so this is MY version)

Pho Dai Nam has more of a Mood-lighting atmosphere especially with the Wood Panels and dim Sconce although the seating is typical Pho \"whatever\" variety.  It is a Vietnamese & Thai restaurant but some of the items remind me more of Chinese than anything else(i.e. Roast Duck Leg, Black Bean item, Sweet & Sour item.)

#41 Special Beef Noodle Soup($6.50/large) came out nice and hot with Garnish(Lime/Sprouts/Basil) while the items such as Tendon and Tripe was quite limited and actually so was the cooked and uncooked Beef or at least the first two for sure.  Broth was more salty as I tasted it to begin the meal and the Pho Noodles were dry-packaged kind.

Staff was nice while the 2-3 tables of Patrons consumed the meal.  The Sprouts didn't look Top-quality in comparison to other places and no whole Chili was provided.  If anything, Garnishes should be pretty fresh still as Fu Yao Supermarket(Chinese) was just a few steps away and even one of the Lady working there came back from there with a Grocery Bag."}
{"text":"Very good food for the price. Not very generous portions but We've tried several dishes and all were fresh and tasty. Definitely a must stop when we come into town."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly service and easy parking.  

All the food is good but I also really enjoyed the cold hong long style tea"}
{"text":"I went here with a friend, loved the food and place. What I expected from the reviews, spring rolls not Vietnamese style like I prefer; actually thought and tasted like previously frozen. Experience was average, but the most distressing thing was my stomach has not felt the same since.  Going on one week of discomfort and my guest was actually sick the day after eating here.  Sorry but this place has made me make this account on yelp. 
Rating 1 star : Upset Belly."}
{"text":"Hidden on the corner of this Scarborough strip mall is this Vietmanese gem. Friendly staff and very reasonable prices. Bun dishes are $6-7"}
{"text":"Never say you have good Vietnamese food until you try it here, everything is perfect especially the bun bo hue, nothing can be better in a chilli day."}
{"text":"Large or Small? Large or Small?

My bowl of Large Bun Bo Hue ($7.50) just looked so sad. 

A few pieces of thin dark meat which I assumed were the beef shank and 2 piece of Vietnamese sausage. All other meats missing in action?! The soup is a weak version of beef broth just add some hot chili oil and lemongrass (reminds me of the paste I can get the supermarket next door)

Portion was on the small size or did I order the small by mistake? But I was sure it was the right order as the lady that took my order gave me the bill too.

Maybe I should have just order the Pho?!

Maybe I should have just skip Pho Dai Nam?"}
