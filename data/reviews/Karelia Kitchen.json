{"text":"It's amazing that its taken so long for a Scandi place to open in Toronto.  Keralia is a perfect introduction to what these countries have to offer.  The minimalist cafe setting works as does the counter service. It's helpful to be able to take a look at all of the different types of food on offer before choosing. Open face sandwiches are excellent. The herring plate was fresh and tasty with a perfectly accompanied with garnishes. We didn't try the hot meals but seeing the plates being served, they too, looked delicious. I would definitely visit again. Its a great place to go with children. My only complaint would be the glib service that we received. Not particularly friendly, and certainly not helpful in suggesting any dishes.  Hopefully this will change."}
{"text":"The place is extremely small so, good luck finding a seat. We lucked out because I got there right at 3 for \"Fika.\" We decided to have lunch and I had the bean soup w chive crepes and she had pork chop+salad. It was \"o.k.\" Not spectacular but not bad. With this said, the coffee+dessert was exceptional! I had the cheesecake and loved it! The waitress was friendly but the owner less friendly. She sounded annoyed when I asked her a couple of questions. Maybe she was having a bad day but I wouldn't be keen to return."}
{"text":"Meh. We must gone on an off-day for brunch.  Very pricey for what you get, not much space, and food served cafeteria style."}
{"text":"We had lunch at Karelia Kitchen Friday, as we always look forward to trying new Scandinavian Restaurants when we travel. We were not disappointed. My wife Carol had the smorrebrod sampler, and especially liked the shrimp and gravlax. She had been hunting for Skagen Toast since we were in Sweden, and the shrimp was right on point. I had always wanted to try Pytt y Panna, a hash dish, and it was also on the menu, and satisfied my need very well. To top it all off, they also had aquavit which helped put a glow on the day. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Amazing! So glad we found this place. We had a few of their open face sandwiches or \"smorebord\" dishes and the cauliflower with wheat berry salad. The salad was incredible, simple yet pronounced and flavorful with perfect textures. The different sandwiches were all stellar and really delicious! For dessert we had a kind of angel food cake that was a new addition to their menu, it's bind blowing - try it! Can't wait to come back and try some of their hot dishes and hopefully wake up in time for their weekend brunch (ends at 3pm)."}
{"text":"I went for weekend brunch with a friend who had recently returned from a trip to Norway and was craving some Nordic food. It is better to make a reservation ahead of time as it does get busy (not a lot of brunch places take reservations anyway, so this is an advantage!).  Service was a bit slow, but the wait staff are very pleasant and friendly. There is a large display case for all their sandwiches, pastries, and other dishes, so be sure to take your time to pick what appeals to you! We ordered the roast beef smørrebrød and potato pancake brunch with hot smoked trout, beet and horseradish cured gravlax, & poached duck egg. The smørrebrød was a bit lacking in flavour, but they were kind enough to give us some house spicy sauce (don't be fooled, it is SUPER spicy!). The beet & horseradish cured gravlax was amazing and truly one-of-a-kind (luckily it is available to be bought separately for take-away!). I also had the Nordic Fog tea latte, which is blood orange black tea blended with black currant tea with wild flower honey. FIKA-TASTIC, a must try for brunch, for fika, and everything in between!"}
{"text":"Bought a Groupon for afternoon tea, the tea, cake and cookies were amazing!!!! The server was so friendly and gave us suggestions since there were so many options for deliciousness. The strawberry rhubarb cake was one of the suggestions and I could've eaten the whole cake!! Definitely coming back here!! Small cozy and beautiful inside!"}
{"text":"Can't say I knew what to expect when I signed up to have Scandinavian based on the yelp reviews here. Well, I've now been here twice for dinner and I'm a big fan. Plenty of tables at 7:30 pm on a cold Friday night, and we had great service both times. Had the Frikadeller and then Smokehouse Cassoulet on second visit. Dining partner had the salad platter to herself (potato salad, baby cucumber, and wheatberry, a great combination in my opinion). A nice healthy (?) change-up from the usual dining fare. You'll never be caught eating meatballs at IKEA again after trying the Frikadeller. Mysteriously absent from the menu when I went most recently, but the Cassoulet was a worthy/meaty alternative. Cassoulet is like a 100% your daily protein intake with a heaping pile of pork/chicken/beans. Carbs be damned (on that dish at least). It's a bit on the pricey side for the Mains ($20+, menu is online), but I was never disappointed with the quality or quantity. Next time I'll try the sharing platter style dishes."}
{"text":"When I made my reservation over the phone I mentioned my Groupon for fika tea for 2. I guess my mispronunciation annoyed the lady taking my call because she promptly corrected me with a bit of attitude.  The server spilled water on my computer and didn't even apologize.  The Groupon itself was a great deal but I wouldn't pay full price for their baked goods (a slice of Ikea-like cake runs for $7-11)."}
{"text":"As a person of Finnish heritage, I was excited to hear about Karelia Kitchen!  Finnish-Swedish cuisine sometimes gets a bad rap (think lutefisk and potatoes), but can be utterly delicious when done right, as Karelia Kitchen does!  A friend and I met there for lunch on Saturday and we had a lovely meal.  The sandwiches are exquisitely assembled with colorful and appealing ingredients, like sandwich sushi with respect to artful presentation and style.  I had the smoked whitefish sandwich with a roasted root vegetable medley salad and a slice of spiced pear pie for dessert for a total of $16...that's good value.  I'll definitely be back to try the brunch menu, the creative aquavit cocktails, and the array of yummy desserts.  The staff and owners were attentive, friendly, and clearly devoted to serving unique and delicious food.  If you've never had Scandinavian food (and the meatballs at IKEA don't count!), check this place out!"}
{"text":"Had a delightful dinner at wonderful neighbourhood restaurant.  Fresh ingredients well prepared and served.  Excellent experience."}
{"text":"Quality, service, taste and interior  Everything is excellent :) I want to come here again"}
{"text":"We went there for brunch. The prices are reasonable, the staffs nice, but we weren't satisfied with the food. We ordered the sausage. The sausage and the eggs were ok, but the potatoes were cold and tasted like yesterday. There was a thin tortillia-like bread, cold and hard. Tasteless. We went there because of the location and reviews, but weren't satisfied. All the stars in this review go to the staff."}
{"text":"Lunched here several times. Its hard to resist to try everything as most food are cold and on display. Presentation, service and quality of ingredients are top-notch.  Best mixed salads in town. A vegan delight. Would love to see more sweets to sample from this place."}
{"text":"Glad to have such a nifty and unique place to grab lunch close to home!    I ordered the smoked meat platter.  Delicious as I love my smoked meats.  The chicken was especially tasty.  The platter came with pickled grapes, beets onions and so on...  A little pricey, but well worth it to enjoy the great food that they have put time and effort into.  Great place for a sit down lunch!"}
{"text":"Love love love! Soul watering good! Great found! Lovely place for sunny afternoon  brunch"}
{"text":"When you walk in the aroma of the smoked fish and meats greets you like a warm comfortable blanket. Then you see the pastry selection and you can't leave.  As you walk around the corner you find a selection of open faced sandwiches and salads that look delicious and healthful. The always ready hot table is equally enticing.    The restaurant has the clean, modern lines you expect from a Scandinavian establishment and still keeps a warm, inviting feel.   After ordering a variety of smoked fish, poached eggs and potato pancakes with fresh squeezed juice I find myself satisfied and smiling broadly.  This is charming and delicious.  A wood fired hot tub would be perfect."}
{"text":"I don't even know what to write about this place because it's phenomenal... very tasty, yummy, well served good etiquette and moist deserts. I could go on and on lol, fresh and made from the scratch . Hands down amazing !!!"}
{"text":"FOOD: Fresh & delicious! I would definitely recommend ordering The Smokehouse Platter to split, it's surprisingly filling & a perfect way to taste a little of everything - also, those pickled grapes = perfection! The Wheatberry Salad was another ace.  DRINKS: Get the Midnight Sun akvavit cocktail, you won't regret it!  DESSERT: I may have to go back just for dessert - I wanted to try it all.  Saffron Cake & Pistachio Tart were good - but the Drunk Pecan Tart was the unanimous winner.  VERDICT: No complaints - great food and service, beautiful food presentation, atmosphere is clean and casual (if not slightly uninspiring - but who really cares if the food is great).  Small seating area though, so I'd avoid going there when it's busy."}
{"text":"A very nice and bright place to enjoy a great Swedish style brunch. I had the potatoes pancakes, gravlax with smoked trout and beet cured salmon.  The taste of the smokiness in trout was great to the last bite and even the side salad was delicious. Service was also very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"My hubby and I tried this restaurant out last week and we were so excited to find delicious home cooking in our neighbourhood! I had the Pork/Beef cutlet with red cabbage and potatoes. Perfect! It wasn't over salted and the size portion was great for me. My husband tried the ox tail with the potatoes and rapini. He loved it. The only reason I'm not going for the full out 5 is because we just couldn't get our head wrapped around the decor inside - it's so bright and mall like. But the food is fantastic, the service was equally so. It will be our 'we don't want to cook tonight but want a home-cooked meal' place for sure!"}
{"text":"I'd never eaten scandanavian food before coming here but I am obsessed and addicted to it.  Glad that it's in my neighborhood and I have never once been disappointed with what I've ordered.  While my favourite is by far the thick cut pork chop with apple butter, the fish is brilliantly amazing as is the steak.  Definitely a must try if in the Bloordale area."}
{"text":"While IKEA enthusiasts may be disappointed that they don't serve meatballs and gravy, visitors to Karelia Kitchen will be pleasantly surprised that Scandinavian cuisine is healthier and more diverse than we'd all thought. (How about that?)  Now, onto the sharing-plate deliciousness of the Smokehouse Platter.  This is such a fun way to eat-- honestly, it's like you're foraging. There's smoked meats and fish, there's mustards, there's greens, there's pickled things, there's fruit preserves, there's flatbreads... oh my gosh, you just keep making these random little sandwiches and it keeps you busy for like forty-five minutes.   Now, three tips for you:  Dessert Tip: If you're someone who doesn't usually like carrot cake because of the sweet cream cheese icing, then you'll definitely like the Karelia carrot cake.   Flower Tip: The flowers in this restaurant are in tilted vases, and the candles are not inside a jar. Try not to set the leaves on fire. (Although the scent really does compliment the Smokehouse Platter, haha.)  Date Tip: If you're looking for a place to bring a date, come here. Sharing the Smokehouse Platter with someone new ensures that you'll have a nice icebreaker to get your through that awkward \"getting-to-know-you\" phase. (You're welcome.)"}
{"text":"Great, new neighbourhood place with a vast selection of light, healthy and hearty fare. 2 in my group had the chicken breast with tomato corn salsa, and 2 salad sides, 1 had the pork loin with two sides and another the pork open faced sandwich with a salad side. Delicious. The chicken was better and more flavourful than I ever could have expected and I love the choice of salads - our favourites were the curried cauliflower with wheatberries and the tomato and corn salad. Both so fresh.   These guys are fully licensed which is an excellent option also serving fresh juices, kombucha and teas. Lots to choose from!   We sampled the pistachio pot de creme which had great consistency but was a little bitter and the chocolate cheesecake which was just alright. I would stick to the cookies for dessert which looked so yummy and simple!"}
{"text":"This newcomer is probably the best option for Scandinavian food in Toronto. It is special in that it offers not just pastries, but lunch (fancy sandwiches, salads etc.), interesting drinks, smokehouse stuff, and a hot table for typical Scandinavian hot meals. In other words, pretty much everything is more or less covered.  The food is all quite good. Prices are okay and you can get a big meal for a reasonable amount of money. The service is heavy and enticing and the idea behind the place is great. 4/5"}
{"text":"This place is a gem in the city. I loved everything. Service (Scott was great), decor, seating, atmosphere and the FOOD. So great!"}
{"text":"Rude, sarcastic, condescending customer service. Good food ruined by cup slamming, full of attitude servers."}
{"text":"After a visit to Copenhagen last month, we came here to reminisce and enjoy some traditional Scandinavian food in Toronto. We were especially excited to have smørrebrød (open-faced sandwiches) again. Karelia Kitchen completely exceeded our expectations. I will note that we came for supper and it was Halloween night, so the restaurant was nearly empty (except for one other lady dining). Based on the other reviews, I think we lucked out with our timing.  THE GOOD: - Karelia Kitchen has both hot entrées and cold, pre-made sandwiches (smørrebrød) and salads. I love traditional smørrebrød because not only is it delicious, but it's always aesthetically pleasing - it's like each sandwich is a miniature abstract painting that you can eat! I went with their soup of the day (potato leek) and a smørrebrød with shrimps, mayo, hardboiled eggs and dill. This was absolutely delicious - in fact, I enjoyed this even more than a similar one that I ate in Copenhagen. We also shared one with chicken, cranberries and pecans that I gobbled up. 5/5!  - This was bar none the best service I've ever had in a restaurant. Donna, our server, was extremely attentive and an absolute hoot. We immediately felt right at home. She took time to walk us through the menus, didn't miss a beat with her hilarious commentary, and even gave us with other awesome restaurant recommendations in the area. Chatting with her was like chatting with a friend who you've known for years. My favourite moment was when she saw our huge array of empty plates (we ordered a lot) and went, \"I shouldn't have doubted you - you guys knew what you were doing!\"  - I must add that after an amazing supper, we moved on to dessert and were just as impressed. We shared a slice of flourless chocolate cake (which substitutes ground almonds for flour). If I had to describe this cake in four words, I'd go with rich, decadent chocolate-y goodness. Chocolate lovers rejoice!   THE BAD: - I've got absolutely nothing bad to say here. Even though I don't live in the area, I loved KK so much that I would 100% come back again.  Lastly, I will add that one of my favourite things about Scandinavian cuisine is that it's relatively healthy for a meal out (no wonder the Danes are in such great shape - it's this food and all the biking!). Yes, you have your fat, flavour and creamy textures here and there, but there is nothing that is oily or fried here. I was full and satisfied afterwards without feeling gross, if you know what I mean.  If you're looking to give Scandinavian food a try, look no further than Karelia Kitchen."}
{"text":"The chef is amazing but the service is slow and delayed. It's like it takes months to get an answer. Too bad because I never feel like they are listening to me when I'm here.   Tasty food though. More of a casual place though. Did enjoy the brunch menu. A bit of a shame."}
{"text":"Visited Karelia Kitchen for evening tea/refreshments. It is a very nice neighborhood cafe serving tasty desserts and drinks.  Food: Tea - I had an Orange Grapefruit mint rooibos tea. It was very refreshing and tasted great with a little honey. Coffee - Wife had a kaffe dulche de leche. It was very good as well.There was no sugar in it. They provide sugar syrup/honey on the side. Pistachio crusted cherry cheesecake - It was fantastic, with loads of pistachios and low on sugar. Cherry jam on top gave it a much appreciated sourness which complemented very well with rest of the cake. Dobos torte - This was our least favourite part of the order. It was very bland, tasteless and uninspiring. We wish we would have tried something else instead from their amazing dessert menu. The presentation of the food is worth raving as well.  Service:  The service left too much to be desired. The waitress didn't seem happy to be there and didn't make any effort to hide that at all. Not sure if she was having a bad day or she's usually that grumpy. Her remark on paying by card was \"The only one making money these days are the credit card companies\".   Location: It is conveniently located in Bloordale Village; walking distance from Dufferin mall and Dufferin subway station.   Overall, a very nice cafe to visit. the service could be better."}
{"text":"Went here with my boyfriend when they had the deal on groupon. Got to try (almost) all of their cookies and their pistachio cherry cake. I loved all their cookies; they tasted home made. Their selection of tea is great and they bring honey in cute glasses for you to mix with your tea. The lady serving us was very polite and knowledgeable. I liked how they pay attention to the smallest details, from the beautiful flowers on every table to the type of teapot your tea is served in based on what tea you get. Overall, my experience with this place was really good. Will go back to try their salads for lunch one day. 100% recommend you to go!"}
{"text":"Ótimo lugar para jantar à luz de velas e comer uma sobremesa maravilhosa, a um preço justo.  Eu fiquei encantada, lugar pequeno mas encantador, dá pra ver a cozinha e os meninos trabalhando se a porta estiver aberta, e logo vc percebe a limpeza do lugar. Os chefs são gentis e interagem muito com a clientela.  Particularmente eu adorei as opções de comida, preço, acessibilidade, serviço e decoração. Quando passarem por Toronto, não esqueça de conhecer Karelia."}
{"text":"Giving 4 stars but this place is actually a 4.5.  Worthy to come here to try their fish dishes, incredibly fresh and varied. I visited this place looking forward to try their appetizers and entrées, which looked great, but what a surprise when I saw that they have a really solid selection of sweets too (the pistachio cheesecake was to die for and they offer cookie boxes for a very reasonable price, I'm gonna take one of those next time). So yes, this is a great place for an afternoon coffee/tea and desserts too.   Ambience is quiet and cozy, flowers and candles on the table, perfect for a date. Last but not least... great cocktail menu - loved the cucumber martini."}
{"text":"This place is an interesting detour and might score a win as the food offered here is quite different. I have passed by this location before and the desserts and smoked fish always enticed.  We were here for dinner and I went for the Prix Fix my dinning companion wanted to get the chicken :)  Unfortunately the main offered on the prix fix was not to my liking and I was offered the chicken instead. Thinking we can do a switcheroo my DC ordered the Osso Bucco. Mine was 3 course offering. First course seafood crepe with lobster meat. Decent IMO nice sauce to accompany the crepe.  On to main I tried a piece of the chicken and it was OK. Osso Bucco hmm didn't do it for me (I recently had an amazing version of Osso Bucco so had high exceptions from now on for this dish). Just OK. The mushrooms and potato on the side were decent. Dessert. This is where the really stood out. We had the Blood Orange Curd with Lingonberry Glaze and Rhubab with Golden Raisin topped with whipped cream. Just right IMO and with the off the beaten path tastes that one is bound to come back for more.  An interesting rating for me 4 solid stars for the dessert with a 3 star for the food.  Service was a bit slow IMO. 3.5 stars overall."}
{"text":"The food here is a great change of pace from the many other cuisines you can find in Toronto. The unique flavour profiles are fresh and light.  The dishes are thoughtfully put together. It is true that the prices can seem high for cafeteria style, but we had a quite satisfying dinner of mains/salad/dessert/drinks for under $60, which is in line with what you would pay in a run of the mill gastropub, so not outrageous.   I had the sampler, and enjoyed the smoked fish/meats and pickled veg/fruits. (Although it was maybe a bit too much on the pickled side of the spectrum.) It is amazing to eat at a place where salt or butter are not prominent in the dishes."}
{"text":"Sometimes a restaurant isn't about just the food. While I was not disappointed with the food here...it was better than expected, but small portions and a limited menu is why I docked a star. Anyway, sometimes a place is about more the food and more about atmosphere and service. This place more than delivers on both. My husband and I were comfortable and cozy; the din being soft and allowed for conversation while not feeling encroached upon or encroaching on others. We felt maybe everyone could be friends here while enjoying our meals and conversation. Bloordale is striving to meet the expectations of the over zealous hipsters while quietly ignoring what is left over from the old school, outdated cuisine of the 80s. Karelia seems to cater to both and they do it subtly and authentically. I would try this place out if you appreciate real food that isn't mandated by the label of the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Oh boy, where to begin??!!!  My girl friends took me there for a (belated) birthday dinner tonight and man was I ever impressed!  When we arrived the lights were at full tilt but with just one friendly ask, they were promptly dinned and we felt comfortable to polish a bottle (or two) of vino with satisfactory camouflage.   It just so happened to be the dreaded V-day (ugh) but it actually worked to our advantage because one of us got the prix fixe tasting menu.  What a deal! ($30)  The lovely server (Donna) gave us all the sparkling cider & tuna amuse Bouche that only the prix fixe should have had and we instantly felt welcomed & happy.   The experience continued on while we tried the AMAZING scallops($22), the lovely trout(also $22) and the finale....the cheese plate with home made rain forest chips, fruit chips & nuts for....get this.....$9!!! It was so good!  Top that off with some fresh baked goods and a personal table visit from the Chef and we were officially converted.   From the great food to the epic service and cheeky touches (see bathroom sign) we were all singing their praise.   Side note: didn't try the deli counter but looked to offer an incredible assortment of healthy lunch options. Also, prices are fair but portion sizes are on the small side.  Overall, a fantastic"}
{"text":"Wonderful brunch. I had sangria, the smoked slamon with duck eggs omellet and the scones. All very delicious. Went with a group of seven and the service was impecable. I am not giving five stars just because the food is not unforgetable, but it is delicious!"}
{"text":"Update can be found at the bottom of the review. :)  -------------------------------------------------- This brunch place is something that finally offers a different menu than the usual eggs Benedict or French toast and home fries.   The menu is based on a Scandinavian type of breakfast/brunch.   The food displayed looks very, very good: fresh and tasty. In few words, tempting.   I ordered a roast beef & horseradish (horseradish, gherkin, red pepper, grain mustard). It all comes with home made veggie soup.   I also ordered $5 worth of cookies to go.   The food turned out to be excellent: very fresh and a superb combination of ingredients that would surely leave you satisfied with your choice.   The biscuits were also excellent: haven't tried them all but only the lemon flavoured ones, the hazelnut thumbprint with cherry jam and the brown butter sand with chocolate.   The service is the only thing that left me a bit perplexed: not because they are not warm and welcoming, quite the opposite. But they are a bit slow, which is ok if it wasn't that they brought the wrong order.  But they change it without hesitate.   Unfortunately, just for this incident, I won't rate it a 4.  Overall the restaurant gives you good vibes and it's worth your time and money.  I'll surely want to come back to enjoy more of this good food, hoping to experience a better service, worth a 4*.   --------------------------------------------------  I came back for Easter brunch and this time I can say with confidence I'm happy to re-review/update my feedback rating the place with the amount of stars it deserves.   Food again was spot on. Not huge amount like in some brunches. But I'm all for quality and flavour vs quantity.  We had the potato pancakes (beet cured gravalax, hot smoke trout and poached duck egg) and a smørrebrød trio (baby shrimp, smoked salmon and smoked pork loin sandwiches with upgraded salad, a full flavour barley with currant, cauliflower and curry mayonnaise).   The service this time was impeccable. Our server was very patient and took time to explain in details several items from the menu so that we could choose what we craves for. Not only, once we were half way through our brunch, kindly he walked us through how the food it's cooked and what the kitchen works it's magic to smoke the food and why it's done that way.   Never invasive and always with kindness he made sure we always had enough coffee and water and he never missed an item or a change we requested.   The food still takes a bit to come but it's a price I'm willing to pay when the quality of the food and service are at the top.  I'll come back again for sure and I highly recommend you if you want something different from the usual type of brunch where you get overpriced eggs/fancy eggs, home roast potatoes, bacon/soggy greasy bacon and bitter burned coffee.   Quick tip: this place is often full. You might want to make a reservation just in case.   : )   Great job Koreia Kitchen!"}
{"text":"My favorite brunch place in the city hands down- don't know why it took me so long to post this! The food is AMAZING and very unique. I pretty much love everything but I'd especially recommend the brunch potato pancake platter with duck egg and smoked fish, also the cardamom bun (SO GOOD!) and the bacon turnovers. So happy that some brunch items are available during the week too! I recommend ordering a full cake or tart for your next dinner party- we got the blood orange tart one year for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit (a little change from tradition)! Try it, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Cute little venue with a very cozy vibe. Nice decor.   Server was lovely.   Ordered soup of the day (vegetable with chicken broth). Best soup I've had in a loooooong time.   Cheese biscuits were okay. Couldn't taste the cheese as much as I'd like.   Potato pancake was a flop for me."}
{"text":"Went here for a light lunch with a friend. We both had the baby shrimp sandwich w/ lemon mayo + dill. My friend had the green salad as his side and I had the smoked salmon chowder. Our food was decent (but not delectable) and I like the idea behind this place, but it was the slightly unfriendly/distant service that doesn't have me running back anytime soon. I don't mean to disparage the owners/staff, they seem nice, but it just seemed like they were offering such incredible and personable service to the table right beside us-- who admittedly were ordering a lot more than my friend and I did-- but still, it felt like a snub for no real good reason, especially since we were the only two tables filled in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Service can sometimes be slow, but the food is so good, it outweighs everything else! I really love this restaurant. Good, fresh, food. Lots of nice things to try. Have been here for brunch many times. It's worth a try."}
{"text":"We had brunch on a Sunday and ordered the potato pancake ($14) and French toast. Both were excellent and refreshing. The meal was filling but didn't feel heavy. The smoked trout and gravlax were done perfectly. The cafe latte and Americano coffee we had was also excellent.   Don't forget to order the aged cheddar biscuits as an appetizer. They were amazing!   Will definitely go back. I believe they also offer take-away."}
{"text":"Absolutely everything tried was amazing. My favorite was the Beet-seared Salmon that came with the Potato Pancake. Best brunch I've had yet.  Try the following: Daily Freshly Squeezed Juice, Potoato Pancake, Duck Scramble, Oka Grill Cheese."}
{"text":"I didn't enjoy this restaurant as the food wasn't anything special. In fact, the salad I ordered, some barley + tomatoes, was bland with lots of oil. It was really cold. And it was expensive for the amount I got ($10). Next, I shared the smokehouse platter with a friend, it had some ham, salmon, rainbow trout and you know what, it was nothing special. It was the worse board I ever had, the meats could have been anything you purchased from the deli counter at the supermarket. Last, I had a dessert, some pie, and the crust turned out to be a disappointment. It was not made with butter or even Crisco oil, but was hard and tasteless. I would never come back here again, it was expensive for what I got in this part of town."}
{"text":"I was presently surprised by this neighbourhood gem. It's cafeteria style is a little off putting for a sit down dinner, and I thought my reservation on saturday night was overkill, but they only have a handful of tables!  The food was exceptional. They have a changing $25 prix fixe menu, which would be great for sharing and getting another side dish, in addition.  I was also able to get just the main course of the prix fixe (cheaper!).  Otherwise the a la carte menu is $18-$22 for mains, and  less than $10 for apps.   Started with the goat cheese souffle. it was good, but tasted more like a goat cheese omelette than goat cheese.  I got the Roasted Pork Belly (special for easter menu). It was amazing. Perfectly crispy skin on the outside, and nomnom fatty goodness. Served with a potato gratin (not very cheesy) and a stewed apple. So good.   Husband got the braised beef short ribs (off the regular menu). It was pretty amazing too - fall off the bone and full of flavour.   Drinks here are the most interesting, especially if you're familiar with Scandinavian drinks - like elderflower etc.  I also love a cup for mulled wine (Glogg) a big mug of it for $8.  They also have a selection of open face sandwiches and a hot table, but seems more suited for a casual dinner or lunch. Overall, it's a bit pricey, but some quality food.  Total for 2 was about $60 = with drinks."}
{"text":"We are not going to be spending our money at an establishment that treats their customers this poorly.  We were meeting a group for breakfast Sunday morning. We had seven people, but the tables sat up to six. Two of us were the last to arrive, and when we entered we weren't even acknowledged. We asked for an extra chair, and got told they would grab it in a minute. Five minutes later, we decided to grab one from one of the other tables just to get yelled at that all the chairs were reserved (but the resturant was empty!) We were told there is no space available, and we even asked if we could use a chair just until the reserved guests arrived? But they didn't seem interested in our business.   Get your customer service together! Yes, i know it's Sunday but we were paying customers. You could have at least appologized for not having space instead of grabbing the chair out of our hands."}
{"text":"I will definitely come back. I want to try the whole menu. I couldn't decide what to pick.   Food: 5/5 I had the Seared Hunter's Sausage. I was curious to try the cornmeal pancakes and the sausage. It didn't disappoint. I love the variety the plate offered and I was full from it all day. My plate didn't come with ketchup which I recommend asking for as their ketchup is made in house and has a nice smoky flavour to it.  Next time I'm back I would try the French toast. It looked amazing and I love that it comes with bacon so it's not just a plate of sweet.   Service: 5/5 the server was great with explaining the menu and not just handing it to us to figure out. There was water given to us right away without asking. She was very attentive and quick to give us everything we asked for or needed. We also weren't rushed to leave. She was awesome!  Decor: very cute interior and I loved the fact there are hooks on the wall for the high top tables so you can hang your coats and bag.   Pro tip: make reservations in advance if you plan to go. It's small and on a Sunday at noon a few people had to wait about 20-30 mins for seating. Although it seemed the crowd died down around 1:30/2"}
{"text":"Well this place is pretty legit. Cold cucumber soup was fresh and very tasty.   Had the frikandel or whatever it's called and it tasted like it was home made, not just some restaurant food. Red cabbage was absolutely delicious.   The carrot cake was ok but nothing special. So I'd recommend getting something else from their selection."}
{"text":"Shared the pate, scandi caesar, seafood stew, and fish cakes. Everything was amazing. The quality of the seafood is great and presentation is stunning. Attentive and friendly wait staff. A hidden gem on Bloor!"}
{"text":"What an incredible hidden gem!  Stumbled upon it quite by accident, having parked next to it, for another appointment.   The place is really quaint, with exciting, healthy food choices. While the patio is tiny, it is exceptionally cozy.   The service was exceptionally attentive and lightning fast - very appreciated when time is precious.   I had the salmon chowder and an open  roast beef sandwich - both were excellent.   Will repeat, if I ever happen to be in the area again."}
{"text":"Karelia Kitchen is a \"Scandinavian style\" bakery and cafe that my Finnish partner is now utterly in love with.  We've been twice now since they opened last week: our first visit was for coffee and sweets, while our second was for full on brunch.  It is abundantly clear that an incredible amount of care has gone into the planning and execution of Karelia, and that the vision of the owners isn't exceeding their considerable talents as chefs and proprietors.  The food here is -- for the most part -- all pre-prepared, cafeteria style, and you're able to mix and match as you please.  Each item is priced between $8 and $12, more or less, and include at least one side of your choice (either cold salads or warm cooked vegetables).  We splurged and, for two people, enjoyed the following:  * Roast chicken open-faced sandwich with tarragon mustard and frisee.  Delicious! * Apricot stuffed pork loin with, I believe, onion gravy (though I may have misheard).  Tender and flavourful, though the butter knives provided weren't up to the job (I expect that will be remedied).  With warm sides of braised cabbage (sooooo good!), rutabagas (melt in your mouth, sweet, yum!), and cold salads of cucumber//radish/dill, potato/red pepper, rainbow beet/barley, and celery root/carrot.  All were excellent, fresh, refreshing, with the cucumber and beet salads being our clear favourites.  Our cappuccinos, though ordered as \"wet caps\", came out pretty standard frothy Italian style.  Minor quibble, as coffee isn't the focus.  We still enjoyed them, but the amount of care that's gone into the food makes me think they should seek further barista training.  If the coffee were as great as the food, I'd have a hard time passing by without stopping in for a nibble and a cup.  We took home a cardamom sweet cake and a slice of \"country\" apple tart.  Both were outstanding!  My beloved Finn adored her cardamom cake and, for my part, I think the apple tart would pass muster with the very best down-home-American-apple-pie-connoisseurs.  Seriously.  Sweet, cinnamony, simply amazing, with more apple than crust.  Perfect.  And to top it all off, they gifted us a couple housemade biscotti to try!  One very traditional and very tasty, the other with a hint of anise that made me perk up and say \"WOW!\".  What a great experience -- thrilled to have them open up in the neighbourhood... here's to hoping we can always get a table for Saturday morning brunches!  Last note:  not sure if they cater, but they definitely should.  Looking for someone to satisfy discerning diners at your wedding?  This style of food is perfect, and the quality here is remarkable."}
{"text":"Not many new trendy establishments make it in this neighbourhood...so very glad that Karelia is going strong! As a vegan/vegetarian, my options are somewhat limited, i will recommend the Parsnips chips, the cheesecake(vegetarian) and the crumble. Friendly staff and awesome chef who will go the extra mile to please the customer. Now my permanent birthday cake maker."}
{"text":"Yummy but portions are small. We ordered the mushroom pot pie and smoked trout scrambled egg dish and smoked salmon soup and were still hungry afterward. Just wished we had more..."}
{"text":"OK, when I was a teenager growing up I wanted to be a Curmudgeon. I have arrived! Read all the glowing reviews of Karelia Kitchen and was looking for a home restaurant to replace Cranberries, which is no longer on my list due to shrinking portions and sometimes really sloppy food. Many of the Karelia reviews mentioned that the place was always crowded due to many diners brunching. Well I guess brunch finished before 2:00 pm on a Saturday. One other table inside and one couple outside on the \"patio\".  Thinking of lovely memories of the Danish Food Centre which was on Bay and Bloor hundreds of years ago, I thought an open faced smoked salmon sandwich would hit the spot. Comes with a side salad or a small bowl of daily soup. Being adventurous I inquired if I could have both the soup and salad, assuming the addition would cost the $2.99 advertised for the soup. What arrived announced as soup, simply wasn't. The advertised soup of the day was purple carrot. Yes it was purple and one time may have been carrot, but it was NEVER soup, perhaps sludge leftover from making soup, but not soup. No taste and a crappy texture, and to make the trinity about a three tablespoon bowl. The smoked salmon had been reading the cigarette packages and was very under smoked, this fish had never inhaled. Finishing off lunch, I ordered the Dobos Torte, wasn't today's torte, maybe yesterday's. Then the bill: $25.00! and a credit card machine with no option for NO option tip. Memo to C hef: buy some god damned salt, if you work it right it can disguise the complete lack of flavour. What the hell, go for broke, put a salt shaker on each table."}
{"text":"We came for brunch and enjoyed every dish.  Five of us ordered more then enough just to sample some interesting menu items.  The flavours are mild and pleasant, authentic Scandinavian. We tried all of the appetizers and all were really good.  Exceptional bacon and onion buns. The cheese biscuits weren't anything special though.  I am looking forward to going again."}
{"text":"Karelia is a little far from the downtown Toronto core but easily accessible by public transportation via the 2 line, especially if you want to try Nordic/Scandinavian cuisine like we did.  Seating is limited and it looks like most people make reservations for brunch as we saw many \"Reserved\" signs on the tables.  They have separate and color-coded paper menus for their brunch and dinner.  They also sell baked goods, desserts, and jams/condiments to-go.  We tried their Beetroot Rosti Smorrebrod [$10] since they are famous for their  opened sandwiches, their Swedish-styled Pitti Y Panna potato pork bowl [$14] with their fragrant homemade ketchup, Duck Scrambled eggs [$14] with smoked salmon and potatoes, and their popular Smokehouse Platter [$22] that came with salmon, chicken, pork trout, and flatbread.  We loved their five-layered dobos tortes chocolate sponge cake, which ended our big brunch with a sweet note."}
{"text":"SO happy to have Karelia Kitchen in the neighbourhood! The food was delicious and tastes really healthy too. They have a great selection of gourmet salad that is fresh. The assortment of open face sandwiches is great. I had the roasted pork with apple open face sandwich and it was absolutely delicious. They also have a hot table with a variety of hot dishes such as chicken, pork roast, grilled fish, and oxtail. We tried the oxtail and it was melt in your mouth goodness. They also have an interesting menu of drinks. I tried the fermented pear and ginger one. It's an acquired taste i would say, but ended up liking it ok in the end.  Great prices! I think we paid less than $30 for two meals with salad and 2 drinks. Fantastic service from the owners too.   Can't wait to come back and try their other dishes and dessert. Kudos for this being their opening week."}
{"text":"Expensive, exotic but worth the treat once in a while. The smoked herring is wicked awesome!"}
{"text":"Nice try, I guess. Travel to Scandinavia , so ? Unduly harsh?Ideas fine; execution not so fine. 'Burger( standing for Pariserboef?)medium well with grease( vs medium rare). Herrings dry and clumsy.Potatoes and potato salad starchy.Had one aquavit .Service fine.             Cookie OK. ? Toronto's only Scandinavian ??-hmmm."}
{"text":"Karelia Kitchen has been earning raves ever since it opened, so I was excited to finally stop by and sample their exotic wares one sunny Sunday afternoon.  The fairly extensive menu is full of yummy-looking offerings, but I finally decided to go with the Pitti Y Panna (\"Swedish style potato hash with dill, onion and smoked loin bacon. 2 over easy eggs. house made ketchup.\")  I suppose I should state right off the bat that the food took a very, very long time to arrive. I did, however, have a direct line of sight into the kitchen and I quickly noticed that there was only one guy preparing the food. And since the place was packed, I guess it's not surprising that it took him a while to get to our order.  It was worth the wait. Although I was initially put off by the lack of heat - it tasted like it had been sitting for a while before I received it - I forgot about such concerns once I began to dig in. The hash itself is a little on the bland side, admittedly, although the plentiful smoked-loin bacon and crunchy bits of cooked bacon are certainly addictive. No, the dish improves steadily as you eat it, as the egg yolk begins to mix in with everything and the dill works its way through the food. By the time you get to the bottom of the bowl, it's a seriously addictive (and filling) dish.  So why am I only giving Karelia Kitchen three stars instead of four or five? The wait between our plates being cleared and being approached by our waitress was insane. I had wanted to order a dessert but she simply never appeared. She walked right by us without making eye contact several times but after about 20 minutes of this, I decided to just walk up to her and ask for the cheque.  It's a shame, too, given the very tasty nature of our meal."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food, with an extremely friendly pair of owners.  Agree with the reviews that it may seem a little highly priced for a 'cafeteria style' restaurant, but the food far exceeds even the highest of expectations.  We had a full meal experience, sharing a bottle of wine, with the Sampler Platter, a mouth watering array of house smoked meats and pickled veggies and fruits (I have never ever had pickled grapes before, but super yummy!).  I had fish cakes with dilled new potatoes and tomato corn salsa, and my fiancé Had pork stew with a rice salad and a celery root salad.  Finally for dessert we had the nectarine custard tart and the saffron cake.  Everything was delicious from start to finish, and the service was outstanding.  If you love great food and good service, be sure to check this place out!! :)"}
{"text":"Went here on a Groupon (afternoon tea for 2) and had a pleasant, welcoming experience.  We were first struck by the sleek, functional design and cleanliness. There were even coat racks embedded into these little niches along the walls, so you can hang your things properly. The ceiling, made of wooden \"floorboards,\" make you feel like you're in the inside of a ship and there's much thought put into the ambiance. The restaurant rests somewhere between casual cafe and nice cultural out night (they light up the candles and put out white tablecloth at night, I think) and the transition isn't awkward. Even the music selection and quality speakers add a nice touch.  Foodwise, we ordered a carrot cake and strawberry cheesecake - yummy, and hefty! It's not your average whipped cream that they use there. The carrot cake reminded me of the one at Ikea, only fluffier and less dried out. It had a yummy cheesy outer layer and the crust was thoughtful. I don't have a picture of the cheesecake, but it's shaped like a tower with a yummy berry jam layer and a slightly alcoholic taste around the crust area (which was absolutely heavenly). Do get that. The blackcurrent tea and earl grey tea were both nice and fragrant, and one pot of tea lasts a surprisingly long time without losing flavour.  Service was wonderful; our waitress was cheerful and accommodating without the veneer of cynicism that you get at more hipstery joints. The restaurant definitely fills up during the weekends so reserve in advance."}
{"text":"Awesome food! They smoke/pickle/make everything on site! Open on statutory holidays too!"}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time yesterday.    My husband and I shared food from the hot table - a beef meatball-type of thing covered in a nice gravy with onions.  We chose to enjoy it with two cold salads: coleslaw and potato salad.  The beef was moist and juicy and the gravy with onions added a nice contrast to the meat.  The coleslaw was nice and light.  The potato salad was my favourite of the two salads - it tasted really fresh and the potatoes were cooked just right.  We asked for a cherry jam cookie and americano to finish our afternoon \"snack\" and the server added an almond sugar cookie to try.  The cherry jam cookie was really good - the jam was really tasty and made me wish we had gotten a few more of these.  The almond sugar cookie tasted like my mother-in-law's christmas cookies (which are very good) but were even better.  I like the fresh decor and the friendly staff.  The food tastes fresh and is very well executed.  Nice addition to the neighbourhood - I can't wait to go back.  I'd like to try one of their open-faced sandwiches or the brunch next time we go."}
{"text":"This is a a great spot for Sunday brunch! Bonus points for clean, Scandinavian design (nice silver tea pots!) and for taking reservations.   They have a lot of options aside from 'standard' brunch fare like French Toast or pancakes. I opted for the vegetarian plate ($15) which comes with a ton of food (I had leftovers) - 6 different types of salads. We're not talking boring, run of the mill salads either. There was a carrot ribbon salad, curry wheatberry salad, a potato dill salad... so many to choose from! My DC had the salmon tartare which I tried a bite of, very flavourful and delicious. We also shared a side order of the cardamom rolls ($4) - a spin on cinnamon rolls, served warm with fresh cream and blood orange jam. This was like a dessert - very sweet and butter-y. This is definitely a place to save room for dessert -- there is a display with lots of gorgeous baked goods! Very tempting... They are licensed and have some interesting alcoholic options, but I opted for a mint roobios tea.   I would definitely come back either for brunch again or to try their dinner menu.  p.s. how cute is it that they celebrate 'names days' -- there is a list of names, and if your name is picked for the day then you get a free coffee and cookies? If you have a Danish name, you might be in luck!!"}
{"text":"I give the three stars because the service is great. Kind, laid back and warm. The food issss...curious. Our meal reminded me of having dinner at a friends house. A friend whose not a great cook but you know they put their heart into it and it makes you like it.   My friend had the prix fixe. The app salad had a pile of cold roasted veggies almost like anti pasti piled up. Not particularly attractive to look at or flavourful. The main - steak was ok, covered in a red wine jus type of sauce. The roast vegetables on the side were super super roasted (almost mushy) and coated with lots of the same sauce. No contrast in taste or texture or colour anywhere on the plate.   I had fish cakes. There was a salad. It was nice to have lots of green leaves but they weren't made even remotely bite size such that each leaf was almost the size of my plate. Started using my hands because each time I tried to cut a piece of lettuce the entire plate of large leaves would slide causing everything else on the plate to get disheveled. Silly and innocuous , but quite annoying. The fish cakes themselves tasted of oil and not particularly seasoned which are two big issues, but the texture was nice.   We had the dessert which came with the prix fixe - The dessert crust was really thick and dense in an unappetizing raw dough way but the buttermilk filling was nice. It looked a lot prettier than it tasted   All in all our dining experience was pleasant because of the calm quiet  atmosphere - we didn't feel like being in a loud crowded place - but I don't understand the mediocre food. The fridge of pre made salads feels like chilled leftovers. For the price point ($100 for dinner including one beverage each) it's pretty darn disappointing compared to restaurants where you pay a similar price point for well thought out and freshly prepared dishes.   Would I come back? If I was stuck at bloor /dufferin and didn't feel like going to a bar vibe for a sit down dinner. Otherwise? No."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times, and also have had their packed picnics in the summer (which if you ever see on offer - I highly recommend picking it up! it included in-house pate, Swedish antipasto, buttermilk fried chicken, sides, flourless chocolate cake, cookies AND drinks - was so full and so happy). The purveyors are really kind and attentive, and it's clear they take a lot of pride and care into the food. The food has always been top notch, well balanced, well portioned and delicious. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Love love love love love!!!! This cute Scandinavian gem has too many pluses to count, but here are a few.   1) Close to the subway. Meaning it's actually easy to get to.  2) Warm hospitality. I've been several times and the servers have been some of the best I've ever had. 3) The FOOD! Where else in Toronto are you going to get smørgebrød (that's open face sandwiches to the uninitiated)? They are all delicious, but I have a soft spot for the pork loin and the fried fish with lemon remoulade. They hot dishes are wonderful as well. Ice only had the frikadellaer (pork and beef meatballs) with spiced cabbage, cauliflower gratin and gravy. The gratin was had the texture of fine polenta with big cauliflower pieces. It was cheesy, roasty and delicious. But THAT GRAVY. It was out of this world. I don't know what kind of magic they spun in the kitchen, but that alone will bring me back. 4) The desserts, I've never had any because I've always been too full. They are some of the most mouthwatering I've ever seen. Want to just go back to desserts and coffee.  5) The decor is what you'd expect from anything Scandinavian. Clean, smooth lines and pops of bright colour. It just refreshing, an oasis."}
{"text":"We came here for dessert on May 1, 2014 around 9:30 PM. The presentation of this restaurant drew us in. I had a buttermilk sponge cake with a praline almond topping and my boyfriend had a slice of their red velvet cheesecake. All the desserts looked amazing. The coffee offered here is sophisticated, like the rest of the menu, but is delicious. The waitress was very helpful and sweet, even though she was serving us after hours. Once we got our desserts, I was a tad disappointed. I found my sponge cake, which I thought would be moist and \"spongey\" was hard and difficult to dig a fork into. The red velvet cheesecake was hard as well, but it had a nice flavor. We did not finish the desserts. Overall, the dessert looked great but did not taste as good as we thought it would."}
{"text":"I love love love this place! I visit every few weeks just to get my smorrebrod and smoked fish fix.   The food is fantastic, largely because chef Leif and his partner Donna use the highest quality ingredients and really care about technique. Everything is made in-house - the pickles, the sauces, the baked treats, the jams and dressings, and you can tell when you take your first bite of food.  I usually order their shrimp smorrebrod (sans bread since I can't eat gluten) and I always get an order of their house-smoked trout to go. Both dishes are heavenly!  My boyfriend loves their fried chicken (with hot sauce!), and their farmer's sausage is delicious too.  If you're new to the restaurant, I'd recommend the smokehouse platter. It's great value, and it gives you a chance to taste a variety of classic Scandinavian tastes.   Their aquavit cocktails are inventive and tasty (if a bit weak - I wish they were 1.5 or 2 oz. cocktails), and their Glogg is amazing on a cold winter evening.   The service is the best part of the experience. Donna and Lief are amazing hosts, and they clearly take pride in their work and their neighbourhood. Feel free to ask questions about the menu and food preparation. They are accommodating and frankly love talking about the food they serve."}
{"text":"What a perfect little spot with delicious everything and wicked good music. In fact, I spoke with the owner after my first visit there and she mentioned possibly hosting their own radio show/podcast since many of the customers kept asking about the soundtrack to the restaurant. Apparently her playlist!    A varied but not overwhelming menu - everything freshly made on the premises and they house-smoke their own fish, sausage, cheeses etc. They can accomodate almost any dietary constraint (I was there with a friend on a specialty program - non dairy, non-grain, non-sugar etc. and she had a beautiful meal of fresh salads, smoked trout).  I must admit, the three times I went this month were for tea and or sweets but next time it will be savoury! My favourite teas there are the orange grapefruit & mint rooibos and the fresh pressed ginger with wild honey. The desserts are lovely and not too sweet. The warmed pistachio (looks kind of like baklava) \"cookie\" with a dollop of fresh cream and fruit garnish = swoon. The Cardamom Pot au Creme = perfection. The layered buttercream cake with burnt toffee atop unlike any texture I've had and surprisingly light.   The lunch, dinner and brunch menu is extensive as well - fishcakes, herring, vegetarian plates, oka grilled cheese. Highly recommend! Don't know if they take reservations but it is small so going at non-peak hours or called to reserve is probably your best bet. And I think they now have a non corking fee Tues/Wed (double check that!) which is tres tres chouette indeed."}
{"text":"Grabbed a table on a quiet Wednesday afternoon during tea time for a late lunch after an appointment. Was not disappointed! I've been wanting to come here for a long time but never managed to find the time until now! I had the smoked salmon smørrebrød with the potato salad, and I enjoyed it! Fresh and light, and filling enough so that I can have a small dinner at a decent hour later! Maybe it was the awkward time I was here, but I was the only person inside other than the staff. So great service!  I keep forgetting I'm not a huge fan of dill... But I can't ever say no to gravlax or smoked salmon. Will definitely come back to try the other dishes and desserts! I haven't finished my meal yet but I can hear the flourless chocolate cake calling my name. Mmm.. yes, I think I will have a slice. I'll work it off later."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why as a vegetarian I was invited to brunch here or why I agreed to go (whoops!). Its true, the aroma of smoked fish and meat hits you like a brick.   They DO have a few veg options, but being a smokehouse it doesn't even seem to make much sense.  I do not recommend this place for vegetarians.   The meat eaters I was with seemed to really enjoy their brunch and if duck eggs are your thing you will love this place. The prices are a bit high as others have stated but I think this simply reflects the quality of the food. FYI brunch with a coffee will cost you around $20 and is served until 3pm."}
{"text":"Recently moved to the neighborhood and have been wanting to try out this cute little place!! Came for brunch and we loved it! Very interesting menu, we had a hard time deciding because there's so any things we would want to try! Got a cold brew coffee ($5) and Nordic Fog ($3.95) to start, both very delicious and above average quality. Got the French Toast with fries and smoked bacon ($15) and the Smokehouse Platter ($24, go big or go home!). We really enjoyed the platter as the size for each kind of protein (smoked trout, salmon, ham, chicken) was very decent for the price and they're delicious, not to mention all the different pickled items (apples, grapes , pumpkin and beets) were all very well done. Chef actually came out to check on the tables and you can tell a lot of efforts have been put into the dishes. Definitely worth many more visits!"}
{"text":"This place is so good in so many ways,  I've been twice over the past month for brunch and dinner, both times had consistent great food, service, and attention to detail.   The atmosphere is very clean, modern and well-designed, perfect for a sunny brunch, but for dinner, the lights were dimmed and the atmosphere was more   Appropriate for a quiet dinner.   The food is outstanding, it's not like anything I've tried anywhere in this city, with unique and fresh flavors. Both times we had the trio of salads, all were fresh, delicious, and flavorful, and sdidn't taste like something I could make at home.    The smoked meat platter was the best thing we tried, lots of flavor variation,  every meat on it was delicious, but the in-house smoked salmon especially stood out the various pickled vegetables had sweet, spicy, and savory flavors that combined well with homemade mustard and stone-fruit jam.    My friend had the seafood chowder, and was very impressed and anther friend had a smoked pork sandwich which he said  was a welcome change with unique flavors.  The wine, beer, and coffee were all significantly better than average.   The service is friendly, laid back but professional.   A really enjoyable experience here, I felt really happy after eating here. It  seems generally really busy so reservations might be a good idea.  Can wait to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"Got the smorgasbord and the salmon chowder with the Burdock beer. The chowder's very solid. The smorgasbord is like a metropolis of awesome tastes - the high of the pickles with the base of the meats and evened with the greens, breads, and spreads. Add some small round citruses to accentuate. And the beer is round enough to cap them off. At the end, the rum eggnog cheesecake reminded me again of the holidays especially with its very christmassy fresh granishings. 10/10 would eat again."}
{"text":"4.5 stars with the opportunity of being a 5 star.  This certainly challenged my favourite brunch spot Le Baratin.  Small and minimalist as they would be in the Nordic region, this quaint place serves up flavourful food and a must try for a different take on brunch.  The sunny bright yellow walls gives a cheery atmosphere to this tiny spot and the worst daylight pictures I've ever seen lol.  It does have a tiny patio as well that maybe fits 6.  A word of warning to any groups looking to come here ... this place is tiny.  There's only one spot that can accommodate a group of 6 and if a group is there, it totally overwhelms the kitchen and most orders becomes a standstill.  If you see a big group here, make sure your order goes in first!  There are two ladies who keep this place running and they're always in motion.  I would say they're quite busy.  They're not you're usual personable staff but they do a very good job making the espresso based drinks, playing the baked goods, salads, and other cold plates in addition to taking care of all the tables.  The brunch menu is quite delicious looking and we had a hard time choosing.  We ended up getting a Nordic fog latte (blackcurrent and blood orange tea with honey), ciders (nice selection and very affordable), a pulla french toast, a smokehouse platter, and 2 small salads (curried cauliflower and wheat berry & spiced carrots).  For dessert,  we had the almond meringue cake and their butter cookie platter.   Nordic fog latte - I always have to try any local style of teas or coffees.  This black tea is quite mild and the tea does have a hint of berry notes.  If anything, I tasted more of the honey.  3/5  Curried Cauliflower and wheat berry salad - these salads are such a great side dish.  For only $3.5, you get a great serving of a salad that is quite different than you typical bland leafy type you see in most places.  The curry was light but provided enough of a flavour to keep it interesting.  It almost felt like a curried yogurt sauce. The wheat berries were great to add a chewy but light crisp texture 4/5  Spiced carrots - spoon tender carrots of dark ruby and orange shades.  I would say these do not have any heat but it's more of a light mild spice taste.  Still a nice side but I liked the curried cauli better 3.5/5  Smokehouse platter - wow ... what an impressive spread.  Plated in a gorgeous manner, we had beet cured salmon, smoked trout, smoked chicken, sliced pork loin (ham really), and over 8 types of pickled varieties that were all very good.  It came with two sauces ... one a whole grain mustard which complimented the richer fish so well and also a sweet lingonberry to compliment the ham and chicken.  They also provided a plate of 3 types of crispy flat bread.  I had so much fun just trying different combinations of flavour ... pickled cherry, lingonberry jam, and chicken on the thicker flat bread one bite.  Pickled beet, mustard, and ham the next.  My favourite had to be any of the fish and the variety of pickles.  The chicken and ham were good but nothing eye popping like the rest of the platter 4.5/5  Pulla French Toast - when you have french toast so good you don't need maple syrup, you have a contender to the top french toast spot held by Le Baratin.  The enriched pulla bread was pillowy soft and just soaked in all the great custard to make a delicious bite while the edges were crisped up.  The strawberry compote was a nice balance of light sweetness and a bit of the true fruit. It also came with a healthy helping of potato and bacon too.  Though not as rich or decadent as Le Baratin,  this was one of the best lighter french toast we've had. 5/5  Almond meringue cake - light and delicate, this cake has an interesting texture as it has airy white sponge, crunchy meringue, soft whipped cream, and then a fruity jam.  It looks like a heavy cake but it's quite the opposite.  I also appreciated how it wasn't sugary sweet but very light to allows the jam and almonds to shine a bit. 4/5  Butter cookie platter- just get this! For only $5, you get 9 cookies that are buttery good and filled with nutty great flavours.  My personal favs were the pistachio and macadamia ones.  The cherry jam thumbprint was lovely too.  All were delicious and even the boxed ones were great the next day 4.5/5  I was pleasantly surprised on how great the flavours and how gorgeous the plating was ... add on generous varieties of salads and sweets and you had one wonderful meal.  I'm definitely looking forward to coming back and trying more things.  Someone has their eye on the cheesecake and the crepe cake!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that IKEA food is definitely cheaper, but you surely won't get the same variety you would at Karelia Kitchen. I didn't like their sandwiches as much as I liked one of their Classics - Frikadeller ($17). These guys pay attention to presentation on the plate, which shows. Kudos to them for that. You won't be full after one of their meals, so don't go on an empty stomach. Their portions are great for a brunch or breakfast. If you're craving some cured gravlax salmon or shrimps, you should definitely stop by Karelia for brunch or breakfast. It's definitely worth checking out if you appreciate Scandinavian food."}
{"text":"I was craving some smoked salmon so we picked this spot for brunch. There was a bit of a wait so we walked around the neighbourhood. The co-owner was nice and is very much hands on in her establishment, so I thought that was pretty cool. However, one of the staff looked really scared and nervous, though she did a fantastic job. It was just a bit off putting as I had to look her way a lot.  I had the Duck Scramble, a special tea latte and a cardamom creme de pot, he had the Potato Pancake, warm mulled wine, and some sort of cheesecake. The duck eggs were cooked PERFECTLY and the portions were deceivingly filling. My husband is a bigger eater so he had to get a bigger dessert to be filled. The desserts look and taste fantastic, so don't be shy about ordering them :)  Oh we also had the Aged Cheddar Biscuits, yum yum, veins of liquid gold (butter) were flowing through them! I wished they were a little warmer though."}
{"text":"Great brunch spot! I loved the cardamom French toast and the mocha was nice. The sandwiches on display are lovely as well. They do take reservations so make one! We were lucky to squeeze in."}
{"text":"I've been twice so far and have consistently experienced great service and greater food. It appears that a couple runs the restaurant - she does service and he does cooking. They are very educated about their products and the unique nordic flavours they bring to the table and their selection of eat-in and grab-and-go items is unique in a city that loves different tastes, textures and flavours. The first time I was there I ate the fried chicken. I have never had a fried chicken experience like this one. I ordered the pumpkin dumplings on the side and loved the creamed kale. The second time I had the smoked scallops in bacon cream with rapini. Yes, bacon cream. It was as great as it sounds and I was treated to an orange custard tart with cardamom sugared fruit for dessert. With so many restaurants in this city it is still so rare to find a place that serves consistently great food and that you want to come back to because you love the service you get. I am happy to recommend Karelia and look forward to my Valentine's Day dinner there. Go try it! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I can't speak about the food at all, but I was looking forward to eating here because of the reviews. However the lady that \"greeted\" me upon my entry was so rude and condescending that within 2 minutes I left with no desire to eat there at all. I didn't catch her name but she was a middle aged woman with dreads in a ponytail. Maybe she wasn't having a good day or something but her behaviour and treatment completely turned me off from spending any of my time or money there."}
{"text":"huge fan of everything Scandinavian, IKEA included!  in all seriousness, one of my friends has been to Scandinavian countries and said that this would be an experience like no other. he defiantly wasn't wrong.  the atmosphere is very, VERY intimate, the wait staff were extremely friendly/talkative, when i received the menu i was at a crossroads with what to settle on with my main course, being a smokehouse, i defiantly had my eye on some meat, i settled with the smoked shrimp, for starters, and the smokehouse platter for my main. the smoked shrimp was one of the most amazing dishes I've ever had the opportunity to eat, the dish seemed small in size and portion, but the flavor was absolutely bar none. because of how much sauce was put onto my plate, i wanted bread to come with this dish, because i felt like licking the sauce off the plate...it was that damn good.  the smokehouse platter came, and i was honestly shocked with how decorative the plate and items on the plate were settled. everything had a purpose, and it was very well balanced. i was very satisfied after eating both of these plates of beautiful food. i left wanting to come back for more food in the future.  i found the pricing at first to be a bit on the steep side, but after experiencing the flavors, i would have gladly paid double!  I'm addicted and will be back!!! Great food and Great Service *disclaimer, they are not open on sunday's or monday's* Tack!"}
{"text":"Was here for afternoon tea (Fika), I got it on Groupon. We got cherry topped cheesecake, and almond sponge cake. Both were delightful!! Tea was great as well. The space is pretty small; I did do a reservation ahead of time according to Groupon instruction. It was a pleasant experience."}
