{"text":"Sadly, perhaps the best part of my experience in the university.  I learned a hell of a lot --- in perhaps the worst ways possible.  But, I always enjoyed eating here, after my exams.  I like it. I like it a lot."}
{"text":"Ah, Bake Chef.  When I was in University, their stuffed buns were one of the things that helped me get through post-secondary.  One of the few reasonably-priced items on campus, they're freshly made, warm, filling, and most importantly, tasty.  My favourites are the tuna buns and the chicken buns.  If you're looking at the meat-to-bread ratio, the tuna buns are more favourable, but if you're a fan of chicken like I am, the chicken buns are great too.  They also offer Vietnamese Subs as well, with a variety of types and toppings.  All you have to do is fill out a paper card with your order and submit it.  It's very filling and they load them with meat, which is something you may or may not get at similar places downtown.  I'm happy they're still around even though it's been six or seven years since I've convocated with my undergraduate degree.  Every so often business brings me back to my old Alma Matter, and every time I'm in Mac Hall wanting to grab a bite to eat, Bake Chef is the first to come to my mind, although to be fair, these days students have way better choices and variety in terms of food fair fare than I did when I went here regularly.  Still haven't tried out all the new places myself yet.  Anyways, if you're ever on campus and looking for an affordable place to grab a bite, Bake Chef is a great option.  14/30"}
{"text":"I'm giving Bake Chef 4 stars because they're always there when I need them. They are a reliable place on campus to get a truly decent vietnamese sub, cookie or other baked good. The staff are always friendly and the service is pretty fast, even when 30 people are in line for a sub.  I used to work in an office on campus so close to Bake Chef, I'd find myself there at least 3 times a week. It actually got to a point where the staff started calling me \"Cheese Croissant\", and I would have $1.50 in exact change for them for my regular order. Simultaneously comforting, and embarrassing.  If you're in Mac Hall and need a bite, Bake Chef is one of the better choices.  Yelp 30 day challenge 6/30"}
{"text":"They make homemade baked goods and tasty pastries. The price of their goods are affordable and reasonable. The service is fast and efficient. I enjoy that they have subs even catered to vegetarians, like myself."}
{"text":"Yummy vietnamese sandwich if you want something quick to grab. I'm so used to New York Vietnamese sandwiches so I can't give it more stars than 3. I would recommend trying it if you're nearby in the university. I like how you can choose what you want in the sandwich. That's a plus!"}
{"text":"They call their sandwiches Vietnamese sub baguettes but if you have had an authentic banh mi you will be very disappointed if you are expecting an authentic banh mi at The Bake Chef.  The sandwich is still pretty good and is a very generous size but lacks the Vietnamese flavor profile. Throwing a bit of pickled carrots and cilantro on a toasted sub bun, a bun which doesn't even resemble a baguette in texture at all, is a let down.  If I want a sandwich while at the university I would consider going there as it is numerous levels superior to Subway, but as a Vietnamese sub it is just meh."}
{"text":"Ooh! Beef Satay Sub, that's what I'll get! \"Hi there, I'll get a Beef Sa...\" \"On the paper.\" *points to a stack of order cards. \"Oh, ok.\" I cross off the beef sate spot on the paper. \"here you go.\" 6 minutes of silence. \"Number 34! ...Number 34!!\" \"Umm, is that my sub?\" \"Well you're the only one here.\"   You're right! I was the only one there, and so was the guy working there. We seriously can't break away from protocol enough during non busy times to say something to the customer ordering other barking their order number at them when they're the only one standing right in front of you?   The Sub was alright. I'm pretty sure I'd still take it over many of the other places in Mac Hall.  I'll check out the Korean place next time instead."}
{"text":"The subs are always tasty and even when the line is long they make them quickly. They subs are a bit messy and crumbly so eating them in class isn't always an option (some days I'm rushing from one to the next with no break it seems!). The spulumbos chicken sausage breakfast sub is also amazing. So if you have time to sit and enjoy a sub, you won't regret it. Yum!"}
{"text":"In my humble opinion, The Bake Chef Company have the best Vietnamese subs and buns in Calgary. The Baked Chef Co and I go waaaaaaaaaaaaay back, they were one of the first places I visited when I went to University. I fell in love with the beef satay with cheese sub. They offer hot/cold beverages, fruit loaves, cookies, squares, buns, muffins and of course subs. To order a sub, you take a sheet and check off what you want: what type of sub, bread, sauce, the toppings and the spices. After that, you hand it off and wait. While you wait, I HIGHLY suggest grab a pepperoni pizza bun (if there are any left) - they are served warm and they're SO DELICIOUS...I promise you will not regret this.  The Viet subs are toasted which I love because of the crunch, they are generous with the toppings and the meat is so flavorful. The combination of the toasty bread, saucy satay beef, veggie toppings and spices is just. so. darn. good. I'm probably overhyping it but it's my all-time favorite. The pepperoni pizza bun....oh good lord the pepperoni pizza bun, I think the bun itself weights 3lbs. As mentioned above, its served warm. OMG - just typing this is making me drool. I remember the first bite like yesterday (which it was) I'm normally not a bready person but the bread is made from scratch and is SO good and SUPER fluffy. Inside, there's large pepperoni(s), heaping amount of pizza sauce and cheese, seriously drool worthy (SEE PICS). I truly did not want my pepperoni pizza bun moment to end....so I got another one :) Not only did I have a sub and buns - I haven't reunited with The Bake Chef Co in so long, I had to have a chocolate chunk cookie to finish my experience off. Nice big cookie for $1! It was soft with chunks of chocolate inside, you can't go wrong with a classic chocolate chunk cookie. I could have eaten two more but I didn't want to embarrass myself as I already visited them three times in one night. The guy laughed at me haha  The best thing about The Bake Chef Company???? Not only is everything so flippin' tasty, all the buns and sweet goodies are MADE FROM SCRATCH with love.  Please drop what you're doing right now and head over! You can thank me later.  Super reasonable prices and hours of operation are never really set, sometimes they open later than listed! GOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The best choice on campus, honestly. Simple and well-priced cookies, loaves, and pastries. Hot bakes, such as the cheese buns, are tasty. The star of the show is the sub, which is easy to order and is consistently tasty."}
{"text":"Bake Chef is my go to stop whenever I am in Mac Hall. They must make a mean Vietnamese sub, because there is usually a line for meat baguettes, but my loyalties lie in the form of a $3 coconut bun.  Kept under a heat lamp, the little treasure comes in its paper sleeve to catch the toasted coconut flakes atop its firm surface. Bite in and the moist coconut filled interior bun high fives your face.   Is it dairy free? Probably not. Healthy? I don't care cause I will buy this till I die or Bake Chef goes under.   Coconut Buns for life."}
