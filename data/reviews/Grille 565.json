{"text":"I have no complaints. Small place but not overcrowded and not noisy at all. There are some tvs so I was able to watch the game. Nice big windows to see what's going on outside and to let some light in. I liked the handcut fries the best. No ridiculous seasoning on them either. Fast service and easy parking right across the street."}
{"text":"My first visit to Grill 565 proved to be an excellent experience.  First....Nikki the server was an 11 out of 10 stars!  Showed respect and care about my dietary needs and followed up nicely through out service. The meal was outstanding!  My steak salad was elegant presented, cooked perfectly and delicious!  I grew up in  Bellevue and this may be the best meal I ever had in this small town.  One more issue to note....my mother who dined with me is very finicky....also requires special attention and Nikki handled her requests respectfully and promptly without showing anything other then smile and excellent customer service!  Thank u for a great meal....I will be back and recommend my friends too!"}
{"text":"Good food, great service, and finally alcohol in Bellevue! Great place. Had the reuben, crab cakes, zucchini fries, chicken Alfredo, crab mac'n'cheese, and portobello burger - all have been amazing. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"Bellevue really needs a nice neighborhood restaurant. They also need to not be a dry town, but that's another story - yet related to our dining experience at 565.

We walked in, and on the TVs was a station known for its fair and balanced reporting. Unless an establishment is a sports bar, there's no reason for a television in a dining room. But it's not a sports bar, because we're in dry Bellevue. So turn the tv off!

But was this a dining room? Or an office? Because on a table in the back were two laptops and paper, like it was someone's desk. I was coming to a restaurant to forget where I've been all day.

As we were eating, a big guy with stained T-shirt came out of the kitchen to interview potential waitresses, within hearing range. Their experience was Eatn'Park, where we would have experienced actually a more interesting and creative menu. The food was fine but nothing exciting.

It's really too bad, because the general atmosphere is nice and the food isn't terrible. It's just short of being the kind of restaurant that Bellevue so desperately needs."}
{"text":"This is the second time i've  eaten here. The first was when they first opened for their Sunday brunch was disappointed . This time for dinner I was still disappointed. Zucchini  was greasy  and limp. Fish sandwich had a paste like texture under  breading. Ruben sandwich was large and satisfactory though my husband said he's  had better.  The home made chips were the best  thing served.
Service was friendly, our waitress  dropped off our order said she'd  be back to check on us, never happened. She did  however  pass on a $5 coupon a customer  left."}
{"text":"I came in after a long days work for dinner. Very relaxed atmosphere, with a nice laid back charm to it, everyone was nice. I ordered the special, sirloin steak and a crab cake, with a wedding soup. I have to tell you, the wedding soup was fantastic with huge chunks of meatballs, I loved it. Crab cakes have a great flavor and not alot of breading, which I like. Steak was great too, cooked as ordered medium rare and served hot and fresh, and you have to love the hand cut fries, kindof potato patch style. I also heard they're going to be getting  a liquor license for Bellevue, which will immediately make this place THE place to go in Bellevue. All in all, price, taste, quality and atmosphere was solid. Definitely best in Bellevue, we'll be back for sure : )"}
{"text":"We live in Bellevue and frequent 565 since they've opened. We really want this place to succeed.  Currently it's the only place in Bellevue that you can purchase an adult beverage with your meal. But.....the food is mediocre, burgers ALWAYS overcooked,  soggy fries, and lately always out of something we try to order, including alcohol!!! The service, however, is wonderful. The alcohol is the only thing keeping this place alive. It's really a shame."}
{"text":"We had some soup and apps and everything was DELICIOUS. Couldn't ask for a friendlier staff."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch. I think that they did a very good job for their Sunday brunch considering the price and the fact that they had a Bloody Mary bar and mimosas. That's an excellent perk for a Sunday brunch, hope they don't drop it once they get their liquor license."}
{"text":"Ok, so funny story time, we go back to Grille 565, and let me preface this review by saying that I want to give this place 5 stars, both times I have been there I have had good food and a great time BUT---

We go to order this time, and my friend gets a turkey burger (anyone who works in food service will know that a turkey burger should not be cooked to order because salmonella) and the waitress asks, how do you want that cooked... The obvious response, and what he said \"All the way\" Now, I don't know if they would have actually made him a rare turkey burger, but the waitress then says that they have people order them different all the time... I hope that it is just this waitress that is confused, but please people order your turkey well done..."}
{"text":"Best place in the area. Great food.  Friendly staff. Enjoyable times. Every single time. I would recommend to all. You have got to try the Tuna!"}
{"text":"Wonderful neighborhood speakeasy. Good drinks and fun times. Try the Brussels sprouts."}
{"text":"I ate at the Grille 565 for the first time yesterday.  The atmosphere is very relaxing.  I started out by ordering the Chicken Noodle Soup.  The soup was fantastic!  Big square chunks of white meat and large pieces of celery.  I didn't have to add any spices to the soup before I ate it because it was spiced perfectly.  Additionally, I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich.  The sandwich was huge and thick.  Perfectly grilled, with a slice of dill pickle and the rest of the plate filled with ruffled potato chips.  For $11.00, you try to find a meal like this anywhere...............good luck!  I made it a point to compliment the chef on the way out.  I promised him that I would definitely would come back again.  As far as I know, the Grille 565 Restaurant is the only restaurant in Bellevue, PA that takes credit cards....................that's great.  This restaurant will be a great addition to a community that needs a decent place to eat."}
{"text":"Good price, Good Food ! I had turkey sandwich with buffalo soup which was pretty good !"}
{"text":"Never disappointed when I come here. The food is always good, and they serve alcohol. I highly recommend the friend chicken, steaks, and burgers. Their pizza nachos are great, too."}
{"text":"Outstading food and service.  I had the tuna fish and it was outstanding much better then I had in Korea when i served there, it was right on the money.
My freinds were all had great dishes and were very setisfied with the food and the service. The deserts was great.
You can notice that those guys know how to make good food and treat they customers! . 6 stars operation !"}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to eat here for the first time and we both ordered the sirloin dinner special.  The sirloin was very tender and the vegetables were not overcooked.  We were aware that Grille 565 is in the midst of getting their liquor license but we were not aware that BYOB is an option.   They have a large chalkboard in the dining area announcing upcoming events.  We noticed that a psychic night is planned in October but reservations are requested.  Our server was very attentive and is very excited to be part of the upcoming changes that will occur once their liquor license is in place.  The lower level features live music as scheduled.  Our return visit is planned for a Sunday brunch.."}
{"text":"Skip this place is all I can say.  I have eaten there a couple of times. The service is always slow and the food is nothing \"to write home about\". It is OK.  Yesterday I went there for lunch. There was one table with 4 people at the table. They had drinks and looked like they were waiting for their food. No other customers in the place. I sat down.  The waitress (I am assuming she was), was (1 ) talking on the phone at the bar then (2) came out into the dining area for God knows what, never acknowledging me,  (3) goes back to the bar area and makes a phone call (4) comes back into the dining area to hang some sort of sign on the door between bar and dining area, again never acknowledging me. I sat there for 5 more minutes and got up and left.  I could have almost understood it, if they were busy, but they were not.  This is not how you treat customers. Like  I said, the food is so so, but the service is terrible. I will never go back"}
{"text":"My wife and I and two close friends met for dinner prior to The Honeyriders show. The service and the meal was outstanding. My wife had the Chicken Marsala and I ordered the Ribeye. My Ribeye was prepared beautifully. It was juicy, tender and not a piece of gristle. The fries were fresh and prepared just the way I like them. My friends also raved about their meal. We also ordered the Banana Pepper appetizer which was very good. The stuffing was really good and the pepper had just the right amount of heat. The dinner salad was full of nice greens and very fresh, accompanied by really good ranch dressing. Our server, Nikki was very attentive and made sure that we were well taken care of. Pricing was good. My Rib Eye was $16 and well worth the price. We will most definitely return to try other tasty meals on their menu. Bellvue is a dry town so feel to bring your own adult beverage."}
{"text":"My fiancé & I tried take out dinner about a month ago. We were excited to try it, since Bellevue doesn't have many options to choose from! We started with the fried zucchini...it was pretty bizarre. I could tell the flavors were good but it was so soft & soggy that it was basically inedible. I had the pesto chicken sandwich. The pesto, bun & cheese were good though the chicken was very disappointing. It was a really thick piece of chicken and it was pretty flavorless. I get that the pesto adds flavor but the chicken itself needed SOMETHING! My fiancé had the pulled pork sandwich, he said it was just ok. I can't speak for the service, as my fiancé did the ordering/picking up. Overall, we were disappointed with our meal, especially for the price. We could have gone to Wendy's & had something with better flavor for a lot less $$. I really don't think we will go back. I hope that they work on the quality of their menu, we really wanted a new place to go!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here this past Tuesday with my father for lunch.  Before we even got into the restaurant the first thing that I noticed was an application for a liquor license in the window.  Seeing how Bellevue used to be a dry town this is somewhat exciting.  Whenever we got inside the restaurant at right around 11:20 we were immediately seated.  At this point there was only one other occupied table in the restaurant.  There's not too much to say about the inside of this place.  There are lots of tables and chairs and 2 flat screen tv's in different corners.  While my father and I were there they both had the Price Is Right on them which I found to be a bit odd.

For my lunch entree I decided on the pesto chicken sandwich with fries while my dad went with the fish sandwich.  It arrived a short time later and we both dug into our food. My entree consisted of some chicken, lettuce, red onion and pesto all on a focaccia bun.  The sandwich ended up having great flavor, mostly on the back of the pesto.  While the focaccia made the sandwich a little different, the bottom of it became soggy while I was eating the sandwich and it started falling apart by the end.  The chicken on the sandwich also seemed to be a bit over cooked and wasn't as juicy as I would have liked.  Even with all of that being said I enjoyed the sandwich because the pesto was that good.  The fries that came with the sandwich seemed to be a bit under seasoned and while I couldn't see any visible grease on them, by the time I was finished eating them my fingers were coated.  Whenever I asked my dad about his sandwich he said that he enjoyed it and the breading on the fish was good.  He only wished there was better ratio of breading to fish as he felt like he was eating more breeding than fish a decent amount of the time.

The bottom line for me is that I might stop by here again in the future.  I really enjoyed the pesto on my sandwich and feel like a few minor changes could have made it amazing."}
{"text":"My son and I had lunch there today.   I had the pulled pork lunch special, $8,  Son had the BBQ bacon burger $9  Both came with hand cut fries, add a draft and a pop  = $22.  
Everything was fantastic, best pulled pork I've had in awhile.  This could be our new go to spot!!"}
{"text":"Tried the two-month-old Grille 565 in Bellevue today.  And, it was pretty good.  Which is a relief - Bellevue needs a restaurant like this!  

565 is basically a medium sized local American restaurant.  Diner-esque food and prices. Lots of sandwiches, apps, a few salads, some vegetarian options, and different meats and potatoes.  BYOB (Bellevue is a dry town).  Fresh, not frozen, vegetables were a great surprise!  The bread is Mancini's or a similar local fresh bakery offering.  Hand-cut fries, which were awesome, as was the medium-low price of the meal.  Great service too!

It's a brand new joint, so I plan on updating my review when they are more established.  I will say that there is a bit of work that needs done... ie. sprucing up of the bathroom (it didn't look dirty, but wasn't sparkling either), a light or fan was removed from the ceiling and wires were out in the open (not dangerous, but unsightly), and the blinds on the side of the room near the entrance to the kitchen need replaced with curtains or something. Basically, some cosmetic work needs to happen. Also, while we were dining, the door to the kitchen was wide open, and the tv's were all playing Sponge Bob.  I saw the owner and what appeared to be his young daughter, who was watching the cartoon.  I get it, but I'm personally not a fan of tv's in a restaurant.  Overall though, with a bit of work and decorating, I can see this being a successful local restaurant.  

It's a great start!  I wish this place luck."}
{"text":"First time here but we'll definitely be back. Great variety of food and all reasonably priced. The shrimp and portobello scampi was awesome. Nice to see some alcohol in Bellevue too!

8.15.17 update:

Just went for Taco Tuesday. I felt like I went to a friend's house to hang out in their basement. They then asked their mom to make us snacks so she set up a nacho/taco bar for us! Cost $5 for unlimited and margaritas were $4. Can't beat that! Also had one of the regulars telling us jokes haha"}
{"text":"I am so happy that I finally got a chance to check this place out. The food and service were so good. Even the other customers in the restaurant were very friendly. Definitely check out the Philly Cheesesteak!!!!"}
{"text":"Revised on 2015/02/15  Saturday

For an evening with family, the event was flawless.  Easy parking on the street at this time of evening (7 pm), greeted at the door and escorted downstairs to our reserved tables.  Manager's suggestion was excellent.  Menu, both upstairs and downstairs is the same.  Both comedy acts were excellent -- everyone enjoyed them both.  Wait service was as good as it gets, but they do need to add one person to the mix when every seat in the downstairs area is full.  Mark, the owner/manager came by our table to say hello -- nice courtesy.  

656 will be doing monthly comedy shows apparently.  This should be a success if robustly advertised.   A Blues for Youth event is coming up shortly.  They flyers on the wall announcing events is helpful, but I would give everyone who comes in a paper flyer of upcoming events as well -- a walk/take away as a reminder.

A useful addition to the place would be a couple of variable power LED lights on the ceiling in front of the stage, or even on the back wall set to \"skim\" across the ceiling to open up the stage visually.  Just a touch of additional lumen power would enhance that performance space significantly.

Bellevue has a nice event and restuarant.  565 is a BYOB place -- which makes an evening rather inexpensive compared to the full bar service at others with a small glass of chard pegged at $6.

I am sure we will be back again.  A fun evening for all.

f8 and be there.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One visit thus far; tomorrow 7 us are going back for a comedy act that will perform.  Menu is basic American.  Hamburger was credible; fries tasty.  Just hanging out there waiting for a business meeting later in the afternoon.  Not crowded but it was daytime.  Waiter was excellent; coffee unending.  

I've now used their online booking system for obtaining seats at the show.  Worked perfectly.  Indeed \"Mark\" even sent email back to my account and we talked a bit about where the group could be seated.  Our seats are reserved.  This is a nice touch since many places with music or other performances, smaller places, just let one fend for themself when they show up.  This is a nice courtesy.

Will follow up on this after the show re our dinner, and the ambience.

f8 and be there"}
{"text":"I have enjoyed the Grille.  The owners are hands on and very good at what they do.  The food is excellent.  Best thing I think that they serve are their soups which they seem to make from scratch.  Worth it as an appetizer.  Burgers are great.  Nachos are something different and everyone that has gotten them has raved about them.  

All in all, worth it to visit Bellevue downtown."}
{"text":"Since Bellevue is no longer a dry town, Grill 565 has added alcohol to its already outstanding menu.  Delicious favorites such as pasta and all American favorites can now be enjoyed with a glass of wine or craft beer.  If you are feeling like a nightcap, head downstairs to 565 Live for some live music and prohibition style libations!"}
{"text":"I'd heard about it, being that anything that pops up 'new' in Bellevue tends to be a hot topic of chatter for a few moments, and wanted to give it a try but never had the real motivation to get in the car a drive up the hill. Tried once when a friend was visiting, and, well, it was a Monday, and they weren't open. But finally had the chance to try it last night when another friend came by and we were hungry.

By all that I'd heard previously, it sounded like a suburban attempt at another pretentious bistroid, that would pop up and evaporate once the three trendy people in the area raved about it, then stopped coming, and the local yokels who are more Eat-N-Park-ish would avoid it. 

I was rather pleasantly surprised that this was not the exact case. I mean it IS 'trendy'...for Bellevue. But then again just about anything not involving chicken fingers and the Sysco truck would be. Frankly, it's about the best of the Bellevue options.

Some prices are higher than they need to be, and some are pretty fair for what you get. I was somewhat budget crunched, and needed 'fair for what I got', so I opted for a burger (which I've been craving for almost a year since the damned Winghart's in Market Square burned, and has yet to reopen), and chose the Portabella Swiss burger with a side of fries. My friend had the grilled marinated chicken with fries and a side salad.

Coke products...always a winner in my book. So Diet Coke started me off, as well as an order of fried Zucchini.

The zucchini was tasty, though a little odd, being cut more like french fries, breaded and fried in what almost seemed like a light tempura batter. They didn't stay stiff for dipping, but were very good. I ordered a side of Ranch to stay away from the marinara, and it was fine, though a little watered down to be runny and not real clingy. I did taste the marinara though, and it wasn't too bad.

The grilled marinated chicken was pretty much just that. Chicken with brown stripes on it. The side salad was very basic.

I was actually rather surprised by my burger. 1/2 hand formed burger, topped with a nicely done portabella and melted Swiss, two tiny leaves of lettuce and two very thinly sliced small tomatoes. It came with a side of mayo, and the waitress found me some dark mustard so I could do my favorite burger swirl sauce, and I bit in. The fries that came on the side were real potatoes, skin and all, but they seemed a bit skimpy. Almost like they'd take one average sized potato, shoved it through the machine to cut it into strips, fried it up, then scattered it around the empty side of the plate to try to make it look 'full'.

I ordered the burger medium rare, and although color-wise there wasn't any red or pink, it wasn't dried out over cooked. It was actually very juicy and flavorful, as was the mushroom. Just the right amount of cheese, and when all was said and done (and swallowed), the amount of fries, which looked skimpy, was actually quite adequate. 

The burger was $8 or $9, and the fries added another $1, the chicken was $10. The zucchini was around $8, and with the sodas the total bill came to $31. Not too bad at all. Similar in price to the other places in the neighborhood, BUT, they take credit and debit cards, where most of the local places will not, or if they do, they are pretty over priced. 

The service was excellent. The gal was very friendly and helpful.

Apparently, this was Bellevue's night for a 'wine walk', and the downstairs space was participating, and it was a bit comical to see some of the wannabee hipsters coming and going, followed by the suburban haus frau types. Yay...free wine...go stillers...grunt, grunt...look how cool I think I am. Free floor show. 

All in all...a much better option for the little village of Bellevue. As long as it's not a Monday, if I have a visitor and don't feel like driving all that far, it's really nice to see a local option that is viable in both food, price, and comfort level."}
{"text":"We've been here a couple times now, and the food is good.  They have a good variety of bar food options.  We got their stuffed pretzel appetizer and it was amazing.  
The most recent time, we brought our 1.5 year old with us, and our server was SO WONDERFUL to her.  It was great, and I love feeling comfortable being able to bring our daughter out to dinner with us.  
The best thing about this place is that they have alcohol.  They were the first place to get a liquor license when Bellevue voted to end their prohibition.  It's great being able to walk somewhere to get dinner and a drink. 
Unfortunately, I haven't had a chance to check out their live entertainment, but I would love to do that at some point."}
{"text":"3 stars because it's just OK, but hopefully they'll improve. They should get rid of the TVs, or at least only use them when there's a game on. No one wants to watch a 24-hour news channel during a Saturday lunch.

I asked for my burger medium-rare and it was well done, but it tasted fine aside from that. I'm excited to hear that they have Mancini's bread, so I'll be back sometime to try one of their sandwiches."}
{"text":"This is an excellent little spot with exceptional food. The lunch sandwiches are awesome, no matter what you order. Love the tables near the front window, and the clean and cozy feel. The staff is friendly and attentive. Grille 575 is a hidden treasure. Just offers superior food in a warm and wonderful atmosphere. We love it!"}
{"text":"First time eating here and quite frankly I unimpressed. Fries were soggy and way too oily. Service was good, but that's the one redeeming factor here."}
