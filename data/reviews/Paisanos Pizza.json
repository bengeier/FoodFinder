{"text":"$24 for a 16\" pizza with two toppings! How do you charge 3 dollars for onions and 3 dollars for bell peppers. Forget the money. They told me 12 minutes I waited 37 MINUTES!!!! I was the only one! I asked the cashier why so long she told me the pizza guy didn't finish his lunch yet! No customer service. High prices. Not worth it. And the crust was burnt..."}
{"text":"Bleh.   Called first thing in the morning to take advantage of one of the coupons on the outside of our timeshare door.  We ordered a medium pizza and a half bucket of \"wings\" with a side of ranch and buffalo sauce.  1. the medium pizza tasted worse than .... frozen pizza (however I love some frozen pizzas)... but seriously. I could have made this at home. Oh, I know.. it's worse than the prepackaged pizza that you put together and microwave.  2. The wings were TINY. like.... TINY. Not very much meat on them  3. The ranch was the RUNNIEST ranch I've ever seen. Even thinner than the buffalo sauce.   Took them an hour to bring us our \"bleh\" pizza and they didn't even have change. It cost about $23 and he couldn't provide change for a $30. AND we couldn't pay via credit card. seriously?!  Here's a tip: go to albertson's and pick up a Tony's pizza and pop it in the oven."}
{"text":"delicious!!! I had a pepperoni and mushroom pizza today and it was amazing! The crust was thin but no too thin, the cheese was good and the pizza was not at all greasy! I will definatley be back for more also the guy that was there was super nice! Thank you for giving me a new pizzeria to eat at Paisanos!!!!"}
{"text":"Hour and 45 mins a guy shows up with cold food and no smile.  Called his boss and he hangs up on me.  Reported to BBB and IRS."}
{"text":"So I ordered a Hot sandwich and a side of onion rings... $18.95.. No thanks!"}
{"text":"We decided to get pizza so we go to this place because it's right near our hotel. We ordered a large two topping pizza with 20 buffalo wings. The pizza was okay...I've had better...but the wings!! They were all bone and no meat!! They charged us $26 for all this... Just go to pizza hut...even their pizza and wings are better than this place."}
{"text":"the pizza was underwhelming and undersized--but more importantly--i got ripped off.    bill came out to ~33, got charged 43.  spoke to the manager and he lied, and then he lied some more.  came up with a bunch of fraudulent fees and claimed the coupon (that was just delivered) was 3 years old!  the coupon was just delivered, and there was no expiration date, nor were there any indications of the aforementioned fees.  DO NOT ORDER ANYTHING FROM HERE--YOU WILL BE RIPPED OFF!"}
{"text":"FRAUDULENTLY CHARGED!  Got ripped off, ordered over the phone, guy tells me 14 dollars, with tax and delivery charge, came out to 18 dollars, ok i'm fine with 18 dollars for a delivered pizza. Anyways 3 days later I go to check my debit card, and notice a 21 dollar charge to it. surely enough it was because of ordering their pizza. What a Fraudulent place, NEVER EVER WILL I order from these dirt bags again, and also will let the authorities know."}
