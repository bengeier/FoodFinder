{"text":"This place is a hole in the wall, but the Food and Service are second to none!!"}
{"text":"I liked what I saw as I walked in. Clean quiet not crowded.  Staff was friendly.  I was given plenty of time to go over the menu.  I ordered a seafood burrito and a bowl of chicken tortilla soup. While waiting I enjoyed the chips. They had good flavor even without the very tasty salsa.  When the burrito arrived, I asked where is the soup. I  push the burrito aside and waited. The soup finally came.  I was not disappointed. Then the down fall.  The burrito should have been called a Onion burrito with Shrimp.  More than half was onion and peppers with just a little seafood. When I was finished 1/4 of the plate was onions I had  pulled out."}
{"text":"Servers are very polite and efficient.  Food is fresh and served hot.  Salsa is fabulous.  I give the food a 5 star rating  but the margaritas need a slight tweak"}
{"text":"It took almost an hour to get our food. I had ordered the veggie burrito, which was absolutely awful. It was a lot of onions and bell peppers, supposedly grilled, wrapped in a large tortilla. It was very wet and soggy because the \"veggies\" were actually stewed in liquid. The way this was prepared was just terrible, with a very liquidy, soggy mess and spices used just added up to a bad dish. My husband had fajitas which were passable. I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Best steak ever Santa Fe cook to perfection every time I go it makes me hungry just thinking about it 
\"Pa chuparse los dedos\""}
{"text":"Delicious food and AMAZING service!!!  Ask for Earnesto, he was spectacular!  Great selection at great prices, my husband and I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Wow! I have finally found authentic mexican food in Las Vegas! This place is affordable. Service is quick! Waiter always had a smile on his face very good service. Best part of all the food was amazing. I was hesitant to try this place but I decided give it a try and it's 5 stars in my book! The only small complaint is at first smelt a bit of cig smoke since it is connected to a bar. However after getting your meal you forget all about it.

Can't wait to come back and try again!"}
{"text":"The staff are amazing!  I frequent Que Mas and they have been consistent with there service and quality of food.  My favorite dishes are: Seafood Flautas, Seafood Enchiladas and Fajitas.  They have the best chips and salsa.  Never disappointed."}
{"text":"The food was average and everything is overpriced. My friend and I were playing video poker the whole time yet only 1 drink was comped. Kinda disappointed because I was hoping to find a good hole-in-the-wall Mexican joint with video poker."}
{"text":"The Chips and salsa is so yummy!!! I love the steak quesadilla and the burritos are big!!!! The service could be a little better.  We do find ourselves waiting to be seated and to place our order.  Still worth it to get such delicious salsa!!"}
{"text":"I like the cheesy mexican hut decor lots of seating. 

Chips and salsa alone is why I make the 30 min drive to NLV.  

I enjoyed the following: Nachos, chimichangas, tacos, burritos. And yes, their chicken wings were good, too.  I especially liked their mess of cheese, fundido. 

Gabriel the manager and his staff are always friendly."}
{"text":"Wow.  Heard about this place from a friend at my last job, but didn't go for a couple months.  Hit it on Friday with my girlfriend.  I'm angry at myself for waiting that long.
Let me start with the food.  They start you with chips and salsa.  Chips are good quality chips, cooked until perfectly crunchy.  The salsa on the other hand, is out of this world.  It is seriously some of the best salsa I've ever tasted.  I basically filled up on it before my food even came.  I regret this decision.
I ordered the Pollo Asada.  Chicken was perfectly grilled, veggies on it were delicious, and their Spanish Rice is great.  There were carrots in the veggie slaw they gave me.  I hate carrots.  The slaw was still delicious.  I do not quite comprehend this myself, but it was great.
Girlfriend went for the Veggie Burrito.  Not only did they remember no sourcream when she forgot (she asked about other dairy items, so they understood she didn't eat dairy), but they subbed the rice too since the rice that came with it standard had dairy.  She said it was absolutely delicious, and a truly unique vegetarian burrito.
The server was a truly nice happy guy, they were quick to refill my water, or ask if we wanted more chips (if you see above, maybe too quick), and again just all around nice no matter who went by the table.
Finally, we both ate for just over $20 before tip.  So, yeah, great value for your buck here.  I cannot recommend it enough."}
{"text":"Service is awesome, and the food is great.  Nice \"Mexican\" feel, and homey atmosphere."}
{"text":"We try to get over there at least once a week, this food is great.  It's always  made fresh and flavorful.  Service is excellent and fast.  My favorite Mexican food in Nevada.  Great margaritas too."}
{"text":"This has become an regular stop for me.  Their carnitas are worth a try if you like it.  Their is juicy, with a nice crunch.  Comes with rice/beans and fresh tomatoes/red onion/guac for toppings and your choice of tortillas.  Always way more food than I could eat - and make a great leftover.

The staff is there to please.  When we were there last time I overheard a young guy at the table next to us thanking his friend for bringing him because \"that was an excellent Mexican meal\"."}
{"text":"Ernesto was great. Food was just as good. First bathroom I've seen on this side of town with zero graffiti in. Resturant was very clean. No dust anywhere. Very chill place to eat. Salsa was food too."}
{"text":"Based on Yelp! reviews, we went to this place and were extremely happy with our choice. My gf had the steak ranchero, and I had the chile verde.  Both dishes were well prepared and tasty.  And consider that in LA where we live, we have many choices for Mexican cuisine.  Yet, Que Mas easily stands up to any of them.  The curious thing for us is that we dined around 8:30 p.m. on a Sunday night.  We were the only diners in the place.  Worried that the food quality might suffer because of the slow business, we found that are worries were misplaced.  The food flavors couldn't have been more satisfying.  Give this place 4.5 stars at least."}
{"text":"LOVE the Sizzling enchiladas!!! This hard to find location is so good, best Tex-Mex style I have found in the area. My family loves this place!"}
{"text":"Found this on Restaurant.com and figured that since I had a free $25 credit coming to me, I may as well use it here.  Sure glad I did!

First - it's part of and connected to the Surf City bar & Grill, so Yelp should actually lump the two listings together.  There's a door and a wall between them, but they're basically the same place.  One difference - you can only use the Restaurant.com coupon in the Cafe, not in the bar area, so don't go after 9pm when the cafe closes if you're using one.

It's a nice, laid-back surfer/mex type of atmosphere.  Bright multi-colored walls with lots of stuff that reminds you of a beach in Mexico.  Very friendly staff, absolutely wonderful margaritas and a pretty big variety on their menu - I didn't find it \"simple\" at all.

When you're first seated, some guy appears from thin air and plops a plate of chips and super-yummy spicy salsa in front of you before your butt even has a chance to warm your seat.  It's that quick.  We watched, and it happened time and time again to everyone who was seated after us.  They sit, guy miraculously appears with chips and salsa, and then he's gone - all within 20 seconds.  Amazing.

GF doesn't do tomatoes 'cause she's allergic, so they even gave us a side of bean dip (gratis) with the chips so she could enjoy them as I scarfed up the spicy salsa dip.  We weren't even to our last chip when they whisked the remainders away and brought us a fresh plate.  Didn't see that coming either.

Best advice from here - get a margarita.  They've got a bunch, none are cheap, but all are delicious.  They don't use margarita \"mix\" here, but go old-fashioned with sweet & sour and triple-sec in a variety of ways, all of which sound great and four of which me & my girl can vouch for as actually being great.

Food is of a surprisingly good quality and served fast, fresh and hot.  Special orders (I hate onions, so no pico de gallo please) were no problem and the staff was attentive throughout the meal.  It wasn't too busy the night we went, but still nice to get a \"have a good night & come see us again soon!\" as we left.

Just a real nice place.  Decor was cool but not gorgeous, staff were nice but not beautiful, food was excellent but not out-of-this-world-memorable or surprisingly different from any other sit-down Mexican place, and the margaritas... well I can't find a single area in which they didn't excel completely.  Best I've had in a while.  We'll be going back, and doing so often.  If I can just get a designated driver so I can try some more of those yummy margies!"}
{"text":"Great food great service great salsa what a hidden treasure I can't believe it's in North Vegas it's nice to be seated and get chips and salsa like back in the day Wen customer service mattered don't order it to go though it's not as good"}
{"text":"I've lived in the area for over 10 years and I think I might have come in to Que Mas years ago and it was obviously unmemorable.  Because of all the positive yelp reviews, I decided to come back in for a late lunch.  I'm so glad I did.  First of all, we had two servers who were both very attentive.  There was a younger man who was nice and another gentleman which obviously English was not his first language.  That man was so friendly that he alone was worth the trip. He was so smiley and nice you can't help but smile and get a little happier than when you came in.  The food was good too. I had the beef flautas and my husband had the seafood burrito.  Both were excellent. I didn't find the prices to be high.  I guess maybe if you are comparing to Robertos  - not that I'm knocking Robertos cuz they are great for a quick to go meal but the quality is not the same.  You get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Great food, great service.  We've been here lots of times and the food is always good and the servers are always friendly and fast.  Price is reasonable and portions are just right. Everyone we've taken here has enjoyed it.  Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Don't come on a Sunday!!! That's for sure. The restrooms is located in the bar next door. Not the restaurants bar but a different business and it's connected so while u enjoy your food be prepared to hear yelling. The mess up part is that they sat all of the customers right next to the bar and not at the other end of the restaurant which was empty. Chip and salsa was good. Food was ok. We had tacos and a combo. So overall kind of sucked I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Went there few times food is ok a bit pricey on some items but watch your check don't pay until you added it.They bought my check and tried to charge me more then it added up to.9.85 9.85 and 4.00 is not 26 and change plus the tax. Told me the computer did it uh huh right was over charging by 3 dollars. How many people paid more.not going back charged me 28 and should have been less. Called him on it ever see a waiter loss for words"}
{"text":"Sometimes the best restaurants can be found right under your nose-passed this place many times on my way home from work. Was craving Mexican and after seeing the reviews decided to venture outside the box of my usual Mexican haunts. I ordered the Enchiladas Vallarta and savored the creamy cheesy sauce.  The entree was served with white rice & black beans, a nice change from the typical Spanish rice & refried beans.  I washed this tasty meal down with a perfectly potent frozen Margarita!  The decor was Cantina-cute!  Nice neighborhood joint to enjoy a cold delicious beverage with an equally delicious meal."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat. Food is delicious (sizzling enchilada). Very family friendly and casual. Great Waite staff."}
{"text":"First of all, I want to say the service was very good and our server was very friendly and always smiling. However, the review is mainly on the food, which wasn't great. I ordered the chile verde plate and it wasn't very good. It was too green for a chile verde plate with a few chunks of meat and heavy on the gravy. The free nachos were too hard and not tasty. They tasted a bit stale. Since I am rarely in the area, I won't be back."}
{"text":"The best Mexican I have found on the north side of town. My only reason for not giving five stars: the margaritas are a bit overpriced for the small glass they give you."}
{"text":"Kate Moss? Is dat' chu' guRRRL'?

Lmfao. I don't know why the heck that came to mind when thinking back on my recent Vega$$$ excursion whereas I/we stumbled upon this ABSOLUTE hidden gem known more appropriately as \"Que Mas\"...

No. Seriously though. This place is an ABSOLUTE FIND that's absolutely impossible to find.

Similar to those visiting LA, ...not knowing the difference between Hollywood and Compton..... I drove out to Vegas while in search of authentic Mex-, bearing NO CLUE that North Las Vegas was its very own municipality.

Consider me schooled.

Fueled by how famished I was after a SIXXXX hour drive out (don't even ask), Yelp veered my friend, a local, and I to this place. As most have attested however - locating this place is up there with trying to find Pikachoo----

Bearing a \"Craig Road\" address for some odd reason, I find this nothing short of strategic. \"We'll get em' lost first, so that they crawl in malnourished and order EVERYTHING on the menu!\" --- Be this as it may, while traveling east (or maybe it was west) - GPS repeatedly informed me that I'd bypassed the place. HOW WAS THIS EVEN POSSIBLE????

-- Continue for 300 feet.
-- 200......100.......
-- Rerouting......
-- Right turn now......
-- Rerouting.....
-- Make a U-turn at the next available light....

Oh good God! Shut the hell UPPPP already!!!! You crazy navigating control freak B#$*%&*.....

[I've got a bit of a love/hate relationship with my car's GPS...] --- 

It's no secret though that when you're starving to the point of being ravenous all the while resembling Rosanne Barr within that one Snickers ad; I'm talking peckish ........to the point that your stomach is touching your frikkin' back, the very LAST THING you're looking to hear is that you're nowhere near the place you're scouring to obtain sustenance!

Predictably........I was led to pull over and phone the establishment, only to look up and notice \"Que Mas Mexican Cafe\" DIRECTLY BESIDE \"Surf City Grill\", all the while the address, itself, radiated from the opposite side of the building, shining as brightly as the damned Luxor sky beam. 

GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!

In any event, we crept in to take immediate notice of a lively, folksy, straight outta' Ensenada type of joint!

THIS IS WHERE PAPA WAS MEANT TO BE!

From there, customer service was spot on, as we were seated without any formal delay. Ordered the \"seafood burrito\" - complete with Mahi Mahi, shrimp and lobster and topped with a chipotle cream concoction ($12.95) and my boey', the grilled burrito ($14.95), while electing upon the option of steak.

I'm deriving that perhaps the server picked up on our weary state(s) of mind, as he reserved no hesitation offering us warm/fresh (let alone seasoned) chips with complimentary bean dip and Heaven help us, the salsa. EVERYYYYbody knows the true test of a Mexican restaurant's authenticity is (wait for it.....) --- THE SALSA!!!

3 bowls of salsa and 2 margaritas in - we were TILTED! We're talkin', \"OMGod Becky. Look at her butt\", TILTED......

I suppose the fact of it being 106 out didn't quite help much either, but for $45-50.00, split between two, the smorgasbord we were presented let alone the taste of the grill amid this type of ambiance was unparalleled!

Will I be back? HELLLLLLL to the YESSSS!

I just know in advance to have my chopper drop my azz off - frontline and center next go round! Google Maps doesn't even populate this joint!"}
{"text":"This place is a little gem hidden away. Food is good and service is the best. Ceviche was as good as any other I have had. Salsa is very good. The Carne Asada has a nice flavor that will not disappoint. Nice atmosphere and decor. This will become a regular spot for me. Very clean and doesn't have that off putting smell that some resultant a have."}
{"text":"This Place is worn down, the seats are torn and its dingy.  The food is wannabe Mexican, not quiet Tex mex either.  Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This place is one of if not the best in las vegas . Even though ive only tried their carne asada burrito . It lays over a bed of  carmelized onions mushrooms n bacon it is so bomb only down side is maybe more steak or slice it thinner . But overall this is 1 of my go to places n lv for quality mexican"}
{"text":"Really good happy hour prices. Shots could be stronger tho. But service is good and it was lively for a Friday happy hour"}
{"text":"Great food, cheery service, after 2 visits in 2 weeks...our new favorite Mexican food on this side of town...fresh guacamole made at the table...delicious Carne Asada...but don't miss the Pollo Yucatan."}
{"text":"Went there for our anniversary. Restaurant is very well decorated. Wasn't to busy. Server was very friendly. Got our drinks very quickly. Beer was nice and cold, the margarita was very good.Server refilled our chips and salsa multiple times, which were delicious by the way!! Food was amazing, wifey got the supreme fajitas and they were hands down the best fajitas I have ever tried. Will be getting that next time we go."}
{"text":"Have been twice in past two weeks. Chicken enchiladas were good. Carnitas and Chili Verde were fantastic. Loved the chips and salsa. Some of the best I have had in quite awhile. Will be returning."}
{"text":"Every time I eat here its great !!!And I can't say enough how great the service is I have never had a bad dining experience here which is why I continue to be a client!!If you want great food and awsome service this here is the place to go.I recomend the Carne asada tacos as well as the grilled burrito"}
{"text":"Think I found my new favorite Mexican restaurant in town!  I've been looking for a place that has good crunch chicken tacos, and this place hits the spot perfectly. 

Service is quick and friendly, with a casual and quirky atmosphere. 

Chips and salsa are also pretty bomb. 

Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This was once my favorite restaurant. Tonight when I came for pick up and ordered my usual ... what a drastic let down. 12 wings which comes with the sauce on the side with sauce. My wings was undercooked (frozen on the inside), cold, and super soggy as they was drenched in hot sauce all over them. Then the ranch that was ordered was not anywhere present. I had to throw the wings away. Then the sampler I normally order was missing food and the sauces for the food as well. Not to mention cold, soggy and wet. The seafood flautas was under cooked and also not prepared as usual (missing the side sauce and lettuce and veggie toppings). And the the enchiladas was no where near cooked to specification and request. I spent 55.00 for absolutely being let down, angry, and disappointed. The common response when questions asked was oh I'm new and we have new rules and new management (which is never a excuse). I called back up there abd was left on hold with no response. After that type of serive ans display of new management I don't think I can return unless drastic changes are made. This is completely unexceptable nor tolerable!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem in North Las Vegas. Came here on a whim because I was craving seafood but wanted to stay local. Lucky me a friend of mine suggested it. 

The restaurant is much larger than it looks from the outside. Typical but charming decor. Remember that Mexican restaurant, Acapulco? Kinda reminds me of that place, minus the balloons. 

The food definitely exceeded my expectations. I ordered the shrimp tacos with rice and beans and a horchata of course. Huge portions, enough to share. Plenty to choose from on the menu. I think I'll try the streak fajitas next time cause that looked amazing. The kid menu had a great selection as well. The staff was very attentive. Refills before we even asked and the chips and salsa kept coming. They were a bit slow on taking our order but no biggie. All in all, good food and great service. 4 solid stars."}
{"text":"Thank you to all the yelpers who helped me find this place. Delicious food, friendly service, great value. Well worth the visit."}
{"text":"This one of our favorite places for our family.  We love the carne asada and shrimp or the grilled burrito. The family each have their favorites.  The staff remembers us as if we come every day and that means a lot to us.  They always go out of their way to make sure everytime is a great experience and the food is always great."}
{"text":"I ate here with my Aunt and my cousins, it was good.  I ordered a chimichanga which had beans in it, never had that before and I don't think I will again lol
I also had a margarita and that was good."}
{"text":"The food was really good but the service was horrible. We got seated right away but waited at LEAST 15min to get our drinks and our server.  When our server (male, quite, hair down) finally arrived he asked if anyone has taken our drinks or orders and we said no. And from there, i was expecting some sort of apology or some sign of \"sorry\" but nothing. 

We got our food and it was delicious. Their dessert was so-so. Our waiter never came back to us to ask us if everything was ok and if we needed anything. He never refilled our drinks. 

I was disappointed. It was Mothers Day and she wanted to have a great Mexican dinner. I'll go ahead and say i will give this place another try and hope they dont disappoint again."}
{"text":"We went to Que Mas for a second try. I was hell bent on finding something wrong with this place. My first experience had to be a fluke. Sure enough, I had the nacho's and they were not as good as the steak ranchero...who would have known? Nacho's here are for an appetizer and although large enough for a meal, I will stick to the more traditional and actually order an entree! Silly me!"}
{"text":"Nice place and good salsa but wasn't impressed with my sizzling enchiladas. The waiter was very nice and the service good. I may come back to try something different but nothing real special about the enchiladas unfortunately."}
{"text":"Two dishes I love here: Chile Verde and the enchiladas ahumadas. Wow! I've eaten here countless times and the flavor is great every time."}
{"text":"We have been coming here since 06, so it must be good, right? We come at least once a month. We love their chips and salsa. I think we have tried everything on the menu, you'll be happy with anything you get. But the grilled burrito is the best. It sits in a bed of bacon and mushrooms. Whaaaa? Delish."}
{"text":"Best mexican in las vegas. The salsa is to die for and the fajitas are awesome. The wait staff is always friendly and very attentive. When in vegas, if you want something off the strip, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"My husband and I loved this place. Its really authentic and we love the soup. The service is always amazing and we wish we still lives close by."}
{"text":"Food and service is always an A plus!!!!! We love coming here! Their salsa is bomb and food delicious! You have to try it :-)"}
{"text":"The food was excellent. A difference from the regular Mexican food that was excellent. Our hostess/waitress was very accommodating and fun to be with. Recommend this eatery to everyone."}
{"text":"This place was close to work. I got there at 11:30am and had no wait. In fact there was only 1 other person in the restaurant. The waiter brought me chips and salsa and I placed my order. The chips were not fresh. The salsa was homemade with 1 huge piece of cilantro ( about 6 inches) in it. The food came fast and tasted fine. It was served plenty hot. Not an amazing place,but not bad either."}
{"text":"came here for lunch and let the waiter know we had an hour for lunch, he said \"no problem.\"  Great service, lots of food and fast. Good combination plates and variety to choose from. Got the plate of tacos and yes, they were very tasty."}
{"text":"Found this place through Yelp.  One of the few good \"local\" places in North Las Vegas.  

I love the guacamole that they make at the table.  Tip: ask them to make it spicy.  I've been there 3-4 times now and keep trying new stuff.  Haven't found a bad dish yet!

Looking forward to taking friends here to show there are good non-fast-food options in NLV."}
{"text":"I can't talk highly enough of this place the food is great and the service is excellent! Plus is by my house and  the prices are very resonalble. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Another wonderful meal -chicken and steak fajitas - quick and delicious.

Large portions - 2 of us ate and there where plenty of leftovers...

My friends had a huge margarita and finished it all ~ I drove ;)

Service is always polite and attentive!"}
{"text":"Very friendly servers every time, amazing fresh food, and the best chips and salsa in all of Las Vegas. My favorite Mexican restaurant by far!!"}
{"text":"Our family loves coming to this place. They always have great chips and salsa. The service is great and the staff is on top of it. It is a family atmosphere where we can bring our children for a nice dinner."}
{"text":"Quick, easy and GOOD!
Try the bacon mushroom quesadilla, it used to be on the menu 5 years ago but they took it off when it was reprinted,  they still make it though if you ask & it's the BEST"}
{"text":"Just moved to Las Vegas and looking  for our go to Mexican Restaurant, we found it! Ordered the menudo and it was just like Mom would make, best complement I can give."}
{"text":"This place is a hole in the wall. A little hard to find since it says it's on Craig but it is more like on Martin Luther King. I got the Sizzling Enchiladas based on other Yelpers and my boyfriend got the Steak Quesadilla. The portions are big. You get a lot for your money. The food taste great and the staff is friendly .. Will be returning"}
{"text":"Excellent as always!  Great service and food.  Clean and cleverly decorated.  Try the seafood flautas appetizer!"}
{"text":"Had a great time for Cinco de Mayo with great ladies.  Margarita's were good and food was yummy.  I had enough left overs for two more meals. I had fajitas,  taste was good but I was sad it didn't come sizzling to me! Chips and salsa are yummy! The guacamole was fair. I think the young man making it table side was new at it. Our server Carlos was very hospitable and gracious."}
{"text":"Heard so much about this restaurant we had to try it.  We are always looking for good tamales.  There tamales were meaty and pretty tasty.  However they had a little to much salt.  My husband both got the combo meal with the tamale and the enchilada.  My husband opted for the taco and he said he enjoyed his entire meal.  I wish I had gotten the taco.  I tried the chili relleno for my third option.  I should have gotten the taco.  I did not like the chili relleno at all.  It may have been the sauce.  I was hoping to find a restaurant in Las Vegas that serve good chili relleno.

Overall we enjoyed the food and will be back.  We ordered take out and the waitress was very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"I always have a different meal when I come here and I am never disappointed! Any thing you order will be great however the shrimp tacos are still my favorite! Do try to have the high end margaritas it is worth the extra cost."}
{"text":"This food was great. I had two tacos. One beef, one chicken. Fantastic. I would have never known about this place if I wasn't invited. I usually go downtown for my Mexican food and was telling my friends about it. Then the food showed up and it was probably the best Mexican food I have ever had. If you don't like this place, you don't like authentic Mexican food. They have a good stock of tequila as well."}
{"text":"Favorite tamale in vegas! The masa is so smooth and the beef is well seasoned. The beef enchiladas were also good. I have been twice and both times our group received great, friendly service."}
{"text":"Amazing service!! Go see Dean at the bar :) 
Food was good. Margaritas were PERFECT!! 
Literally not one complaint."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant this is real delicious mexican food! Compliments to the chef! ALL the dishes are amazing!!!! This place is better than some big brand chain restaurants way, way better! I have never been to the bar side but the restaurant is amazing & great quality! 

The location is kinda hidden but just wait till u try the food! Great service everything I go there. Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I went last night for late dinner around 8pm. The restaurant was not busy there were but a few patrons. We were seated rather quickly. We had our orders taken quickly and served pipping HOT you could feel the heat from the plates. My daughter had the trio (tacos and enchiladas) my husband had the shrimp tacos and I had the taquitos. Everyone was pleased with their food except me. The food tasted well except when I took a first bite there was oil still in the taquito which squirted out into my hand then burned my tongue! We had been here many times it was our favorite place but our server seemed to be the only waiter and was servicing 5 tables in all directions and often didn't check on us because he was so busy. I was disappointed, so sad because we really liked this place."}
{"text":"I was seated quickly after entering the restaurant.  While looking at the menu, warm chips and tasty salsa were delivered to the table.  I ordered the Que Mas burrito and was pleasantly surprised when it arrived about 8 minutes later.  It was hot, delicious and made exactly the way I ordered it.  My sever, Alan P., checked to see how I was doing a few moments after I had a chance to try the huge burrito, rice and beans.  Everything was delicious and the service was spot on!  I enjoyed my dinner and I plan to be back soon!"}
{"text":"The best thing about this restaurant was the variety of margaritas.  The food was just so-so at best.  The service, too, was merely average.  I asked for queso dip and was provided a plate of refried bean dip.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"After reading reviews we were expecting a great homemade Mexican meal. Didn't think the quality of food was that great, there were whole tomatoes in our salsa, the rice and beans were not very hot, and my que mas burrito tasted very bland. Won't be going back or recommending this place."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre. Our waiter took our order and he was clearly forgetful, yet didn't think it would be a good idea to write down our order, so of course my order was wrong. After the busser gave us our food, the waiter didn't come check on us, we had to flag him down to let him know the order was wrong. After that we never saw him again, it was just the busser helping us, who was very nice, if he would have been our server from the beginning our experience might have been different. *****Also I had regular beans in some type of small nacho bowl yet under my lettuce my rice was mixed with refried beans which doesn't make sense unless they are using other peoples unfinished rice and beans and hiding it under the lettuce."}
{"text":"We always come here when we crave mexican food but don't want to drive far. The staff is very nice and are very good about fixing incorrect orders. The chips and salsa are good and so is the rest of their food, however I have never had a dessert here. (Mexican desserts are always so weird to me)"}
{"text":"Legit Mexican food! We ordered and picked it up, so I can't speak to the service or actual restaurant, but my brother said everyone was super friendly. Definitely check it out if you're looking for affordable Mexican in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great food, great flavor great portions.  The cashier was very friendly.  I asked for #6 which includes a beef burrito and cheese enchilada, the cook messed up on my order, not once but three times.  She got upset when I had to go to the cashier to let her know that it was wrong, gave me a dirty look each time I asked for it to be done again.  I'm not the type to complain about much but when I'm paying for my service I expect it to be done right and the way I had ordered it.  I love Don Tortaco, but the service is not the greatest nor the best.  It can definitely improve"}
{"text":"Reviews brought me in. Good food and service will bring me back. From the friendliness of the hostess to the perfect recommendation of the carnitas burrito by the excellent server.  Chips and salsa - addictive. Could've sat here all night chowing down but I resisted!  Great from beginning to end!"}
{"text":"Not the typical type of Mexican food that I go for but it is good more of a commercial Mexican than I generally like but the great staff has always been consistent along with the food, which is what makes me fall in the four star rating."}
{"text":"We are from San Diego and were looking for some good Mexican food Que Va has good food and very generous portions we will be back."}
{"text":"TLDR: Lunch specials available; free chips and salsa; adjacent smoking bar available; adequate service

My friends and I were in the area and wanted a sit down restaurant with complimentary chips and salsa after a long night of listening to political debates.

With no other places in sight, we happened upon this quaint building. Near closing, we didn't expect quick service; however, we were unpleasantly surprised to smell the draft of smoking flowing through the built-in tin roof from the bar to the restaurant: a clear violation of NCIAA. 

The menu was enough to quickly skim and make a decision. I imagine lunch would be fine due to the price point on weekdays, but dinner isn't that much more expensive. Would I travel out to break bread with friends here? No, but I would offer the establishment another chance if new recipes improved the taste of my meal."}
{"text":"Just great! From salsa to chips to final meal! Outstanding service. Authentic Traditional Mexican Flavor which is hard to duplicate. I will come back again."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food on Craig Road and maybe even in the area. The service was great and so was the food. Chips and salsa are  it's a bit hidden but once you've found it, you be ashamed to eat Mex food elsewhere."}
{"text":"I am so glad we found this place.  So many Las Vegas Mexican restaurants have disappointed me, especially since so many end up being fusion style food.  This place was both delicious and authentic.  The menu is large with lots of vegetarian offerings.  They have a unique salsa with their tortilla chips that was excellent.  My husband ate the best chili verde chimichanga he has ever had.  I had a wonderful enchilada.  The service was fantastic.  There were probably 15 beers offered, wines, and several margaritas, all at reasonable prices.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Well, where do I start. It's in the same building as a bar so when you walk in it's very smokey.
Our drink orders were taken quickly. We ordered our food. Three other tables came in about 15 minutes after we ordered and they all got their food while we're eating what tasted like store bought chips and salsa.
When our food arrived the beans and rice looked nuked. Food was ok. My husband ended up getting sick after eating the shrimp quesadilla. 
What did it in for me is the filthy, disgusting bathroom. I've never seen a bathroom with so many bodily fluids on the seats in my life! And no soap! So gross.
Please....don't go!"}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed my experiences here. Great food, great prices, cold beer
A couple of things that I wish they would offer. A hotter salsa and serve black beans or pinto beans instead of refried beans."}
{"text":"Not a bad restaurant. Atmosphere and Deco was a little cheesy! Service was very good. The guy checked on us many times and was very friendly. He brought us a new bowl of chips and salsa after 5 minutes. I really liked their roasted pepper salsa. We ordered the appetizer platter and a combo meal, which included a burrito and a taco, plus rice and beans. They were both very good and the portions were big. We ended up only eating half of the appetizer sampler and not even touching the other one. I probably wouldn't make an extra trip to go there but it was a good alternative to the restaurants in that area."}
{"text":"Taquitos!  They're amazing, super fresh and piping hot. The sour cream and guacamole were an excellent addition. We are even impressed with the rice and beans. This place is tucked away in a fairly large shopping center. If you didn't know where to look, you could miss it. The wife and I both had the beef taquitos. Our daughter had the steak grilled burrito. That thing was huge. We ended with an order of sopapillas. Everything was excellent. Plenty of parking. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and great food! Best Mexican food in North Las Vegas!  The tortillas and salsa are second to none! Try the burritos!  Every dish is awesome!"}
{"text":"Well I guess in 5 months a place can drastically change.... for the worse. 

I came in here twice in the last month and a half and it was a bad experience. Yesterday's experience was so horrible that I most likely won't be back.

My friend and I came in about 6:30 to get some food and it took about 10 minutes for the waiter to come to the front and take our order.

We ordered enchilada plate and the 3 combo plate with only 1 simple request, which was no cheese on anything. Basically when we got home and saw the food very single thing had cheese on it. 

So in a nutshell if you come here you'll have to be extremely patient, because they only have 1 server who is doing the job of 5 or more people. 

And if you have a special request to make on your order your basically wasting your time, because they won't get it right.

So now you have been forewarned about the service if you decide to come here.

This was a pretty huge disappointment and there's really no excuse to only have 1 person doing all the work.

I saw a party of 5 people just walk out after waiting 20 minutes, which is not a good sign if your wanting to stay in business."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place, its connected to Surf City Bar & Grill, aside from that your greeted by a very friendly staff once seated your given complementary homemade chips with a roasted red pepper salsa (yum). The menu is simple but if your looking for simple this is a great Mexican Cuisine Casual eatery for North Las Vegas. They do have a children's menu and the staff is very patient even with the most obnoxious little ones (my lil guy). My favorite is the Grilled Chicken Soft Tacos with Chipotle Tatar Sauce Muy Bueno! 

Recommend for a laid back atmosphere."}
{"text":"In the area so we tried it out. We had a hard time finding it since its on the MLK side even though the address is Craig. Anyhow, the restaurant is much bigger than it looks outside. Pretty nicely decorated with lots of tables and booths. Really tasty chips and salsa were promptly on the table. Wifey tried the Chile Verde Chimichanga. She loved it. I had the Carnitas and they were really great. The food was better then we expected and will be returning. Great to have this place in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"Great food, great service! Gracias Ernesto..... best waiter I've ever had. You are amazing! And compliments to the chef the food was great. Sizzling enchiladas and taquitos are to die for!"}
{"text":"This place is the best! The atmosphere is simply amazing, the food is always fresh, quick and delicious and the staff is hands down some of the nicest people I have ever seen in the food business. I love going here and probably go more than I should. Oh and the price, amazing too! I love the beef tamales, the enchiladas, and my husband loves the fajitas. It is kind of hidden but so worth finding!"}
{"text":"Amazing service, delicious food, and very accomidating. Music was a bit loud for my taste at the time, wasn't busy but it was an early lunch."}
{"text":"The chips and salsa are the best thing here that I have tried. Their tortillas are like the ones you buy at the store and their beans taste like Rosarita canned beans. This is probably a good place to go for drinks and appetizers but not so much for a meal. The staff was very friendly. Ill probably go back just for the convenience."}
{"text":"We stopped here after a visit to Craig Ranch Regional Park. Super cute decor, California Mexican look. The food was very tasty. The chips and salsa had good flavor. We ordered a side of guacamole extra spicy (9), fish tacos (great crema), carnitas taco (10), and 3 kids meals. The horchata was yummy and free refills. Leaving content and full."}
{"text":"Military discount, kids menu

Otherwise standard mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Que Mas is one of our favorite Mexican restaurants in Vegas. Friendly, efficient service and delicious food. Love their salsa and chips. My husband usually orders enchilada plate with pot beans instead of refried beans. And I love their steak tacos with avocado. Great food - generous portions. Good service and descent prices."}
{"text":"Amazing Mexican food. The service was fabulous as well. 

We started with the complimentary chips and salsa, along with guacamole and cheese dip. Our waiter brought the ingredients for the guacamole and prepared it right at our table. It was fresh and very tasty! The cheese dip was served in a skillet with veggies and seasoning mixed in.  I had never had cheese dip like that at a Mexican restaurant, and it was GOOD.

For our entrees, I had the Arroz con Pollo (chicken with veggies, rice, and cheese) and a cheese enchilada. My boyfriend had the super nachos with shredded beef. Both were very big portions, hot, and delicious. We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Eh... sadly, the last few times we've gone there/ordered take-out from there, its been less than awesome.  There's something in the ranchero and enchilada sauces, some kind of spice, that they are getting REALLY heavy-handed with. In fact, even the smell of it turns my stomach now, sadly. I can't put my finger on what it is... oregano or maybe cloves?  Whatever it is, it's not a good thing.  

Their rice has been especially dry and clumpy the last few times we've ordered, as well.

Their beans are still delicious, their salsa still rocks, but I do think they could pony up for some homemade chips. It's not that hard to make them and it would make their great salsa stand out more.

Their service is still great, too, but overall the place is just not as awesome as it was for me before. Bummer."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for sunday afternoon dinner and were so impressed. The food is incredible as is the service. Anna was our waitress and did a great job. We will be back again, this just became my fave spot."}
{"text":"This place is pretty close to where I work so I stop by every now and then when I feel like treating myself. From the outside it looks a little bit sketch and not exactly labeled too well with their signage, but inside it has a pretty cool vibe. 

This most recent time I had the vegetable enchiladas. I was surprised how good these really were. They were packed full of flavorful, roasted vegetables and came with a side of rice and beans as well. The only downside to this place is I feel like their chips & salsa isn't as good as another local competitor, but their menu is definitely better. 

Either way I'll keep coming back. I love how many lunch special options they have as well."}
{"text":"Really sweet people, clean environment and the food was capital BOMB Diggity my peeps. Tried the steak tacos and mmmm heaven."}
{"text":"((Nom nom)) this place is soooo good!! I recommend getting the hand-made guacamole! They make it right at your table! Also their salsa is to die for! I got the sizzling enchiladas (mostly because a yelp review at a picture of it and it looked Devine :) ) yummy! I was full from the guac and salsa it was so hard to eat haha yum! Highly recommend! It's location is hidden and it's sort of a hole-in-the-wall kinda place, but in my experience those are usually the best kind of places!"}
{"text":"Food was good... ezcept the chicken enchilada I did not like their chicken. Chips and salsa were AWESOME..."}
{"text":"Not fancy but really good Mexican food!  The chile verde burrito was excellent.  We go often since it is near our house."}
{"text":"Que Mas is inside of Surf City... The entrance is about 60 feet south of Surf city. Good food, good service by our waitor, Manny. Read my review for Surf City. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went for dinner and it was amazing! The service was beyond great and the food was even better! Best fajitas we've had in a long time!"}
{"text":"Actually went to Surf city Bar & Grille but it's more a bar so we ended up in Que Mas attached . Well it's mexican food nothing special. Nothing great to talk about. Had to try once won't go back."}
{"text":"It's like almost being in Mexico on Isla Mujeres. 
Very comfortable the food is great as well as the service a must go if you have not been here, the lunches a reasonable and filling, plenty of chips and salsa very friendly staff."}
{"text":"I ordered the beef burrito and my wife got the cheese enchilada! Very delicious didn't look like a lot of food but was stuffed about halfway through! Definitely will be coming back here again"}
{"text":"First time here & food was great but SERVICE was horrible!! 

We had fajitas & a seafood burrito was awesome!  

We will go back, but planned to ask for a different waiter.  The server,  Manuel,  was unpersonable & not welcoming!  He seemed like he didn't want to be there. 
-forgot my water with no ice 
-no utensils & napkins - got us forks but only 2!! It was 3 of us & baby.  Is there a shortage of forks? They had to bring 1 more & he sent a girl to do that. 
-forgot my guacamole 
-didn't get our Military discount after asking 
Few other things & just disappointing.  

Such a shame... 
Hope next post will be better!"}
{"text":"I thought the food was amazing!!!! To top it off, the chips and salsa that you start off with were absolutely delicious. I also had the luxury of enjoying an Apple margarita that was unlike any other I've ever had. The staff was very friendly. The restaurant was very clean and provided an intimate setting. It's tucked away in regards to location. I've seen this place for years and I've never had the curiosity to want to go try it. I was wrong and glad that I utilize Yelp to assist me in selecting my new foodie adventure."}
{"text":"Food is great. Chips a lil salty but a lot of food for great price. Server was very friendly"}
{"text":"Great food, great service! Need I say more?
Don't let the location or outside fool you! They have a great atmosphere inside!"}
{"text":"Recently went back to Que Mas and the food wasn't as good as it was 3 months ago. They were out of chocolate milk that disgruntled the preschooler. I had the sizzling enchiladas which weren't bad but my husband had the double decker enchiladas which were salty and tepid at best. I noticed the rice served along with my sizzling enchiladas was also like warm and flavorless. Did they change cooks recently? This was not their night."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant for the first time, it is located down the street from where my father-in-law lives. It looked a bit small from the outside but once we went indoors it is quite big. We got seated promptly served promptly and the food was delicious, the staff was very nice as well."}
{"text":"After living in Vegas for over 19 years, I found THE Mexican restaurant to go to. So delicious, cool spot too!"}
{"text":"Had the carne asada burrito. Excellent service from Ernesto and Gabe. I like the fresh made chips and salsa."}
{"text":"We have been dining at Que Mas for almost 10 years now. The food is consistently delicious. Right from the free warm tortillas and tasty salsa to every menu item. I recommend the beef chimichanga and grilled burrito. Both are so flavorful and zesty. I always leave too full to move. The service is second to none. I love this restaurant."}
{"text":"It may look teeny tiny and kind of grungy from the outside, but Que Mas Mexican Cafe drastically improves once you're seated inside the restaurant. I came here on a weekday for a lunch date with my husband. After promptly being seated, we were presented with warm chips and a generous helping of salsa. 

While looking at the menus, we realized that the pricing was different between our two menus. Looks like Que Mas is in need of a menu overhaul! You gotta be consistent with pricing, guys. 

I'll just get to the food...

SIZZLING ENCHILADAS ($14.95): These enchiladas were super sizzling! The sauce on top of the enchiladas was not my favorite. It reminded me of Velveeta sauce. The cheese inside the enchilada though, was tasty. The enchiladas were accompanied by refried beans, rice, and a spoonful of sour cream and guacamole. Overall I enjoyed my entree, although I wouldn't order it again.   

HORCHATA ($2.50): According to my husband, this was the best horchata he's ever had. But what does he know? He's a Wedo lol. In all seriousness, Que Mas was indeed serving up some pretty awesome horchata. It wasn't milky thick and was heavy on the sweet side. And yes, you get refills on the horchata. Yay! 

CHURROS ($4.50?): Horrendous. These were the worst churros I've ever had. They tasted stale and as if they'd been fried in leftover grease used for other entrees. The sugar/cinnamon wasn't even sticking to the churros. Do NOT order the flippin churros. 

SERVICE: Great, from beginning to end. The servers were friendly, attentive and checked up on us often. 
PRO TIP: There's a restaurant.com certificate for $25 for $50, although I would only recommend it for parties of 4+. We had a really hard time getting to that threshold.  

Aside from the churros, everything was great! Return visit? You know it!

Random fact: They just started serving Hofbrauhaus Hefe Weizen ($5). Being attached to a bar has its perks!

{"text":"This place is clean, staff is very friendly and good customer service but This place is not authentic Mexican food. 
You get chips (not fresh made) and salsa.  The food looks great but the taste is just not there. The rice was greasy and flavorless. I got a combination with a chicken enchilada and chili Rellano. The chicken in the enchilada has no flavor and the enchilada sauce was bland.  The chili Rellano was ok once I took the sauce off the top. The sauce tasted like spaghetti sauce. Beans were so so.
My husband got the carne Asada but it's not carne Asada it is unseasoned flap meat. With a dollop of flavored butter on top (odd?)

Like I said it was clean and the staff was great and friendly but we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Four years ago when we moved to Vegas this was our go to hole in the wall Authentic Mexican Restaurant.  We have since moved to the other side of town and don't get here as often.  

Food: Not the typical Americanized Mexican food.  We always get the chili relleno, different type of sauce and they use fresh chilis which I like because sometimes there is a little heat to them.  Enchilada sauce is tangy not bland which is a plus because of my family's taste buds. Chips are always hot and fresh and I love the seasoned salt they sprinkle on them.  Rice and beans have flavor which is a must!  Fajitas are great because they also add zucchini and mushrooms which you don't see often at other restaurants and they use a good quality Carne Asada, very tender.

Service:  The service is fast and efficient.  They are very good at refills, checking back and the food comes out fast.  Not very personable but friendly enough.  If you're on a quick lunch break you should have no problem getting in and out on time.

Overall, we love it here and will keep coming back.  We have tried a lot on the menu and the food has NEVER disappointed, in fact, I get extremely indecisive when we go here. The food is priced just right for the amount and quality that you get.  Keep Yelpin Y'All!"}
{"text":"This was a one time experience. Restaurant is on the side of a bar. Decor is ok, you get the vague feeling of entering a small village near the ocean...Was seated by a very nice hostess, waiter brought salsa/chips. Salsa is tasty/warm, chips stale. Order very simple combo dinners, tacos/tamales, cheese enchalada/chile rellano. Waiter screwed second order up presented me w/ enchalada/tamale.
He corrected his mistake,but took him 10 min, served me the same rice/beans on the original plate. Tamales not home made, came from a box of tamales, that you could buy at Costco or Sam's. So on that note we decided this was not a place we wanted to eat"}
{"text":"I used to come here and the food was great I just came on the 1/30/15 and the food was salty like the ocean ... The shrimp plate Diablo sauce was horrible if you come from having a home cook Mexican dinner then don't come here I rather go to Taco Bell"}
{"text":"Been living in the area for 15 years and never been here, finally went with my mom for a lunch date last week. It was well worth the wait, the food was AMAZING!! Great attentive service from everyone inside. We will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"This place serves the best Mexican food in north Las Vegas! After hours, it's transitions in the bar next door, which the food is exactly the same which is a major plus! Love their food and the micheladas are bomb, too!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and the food is always tasty.

That's not to say what the first impressions are like, because the doors are plain, solid wood boards, making you think either they are closed down, or a car drove through their front window.  Seriously, guys.  Get some better doors with some detail on them that don't look like they were made in shop class.

The service is generally very good.  Today's server took forever to notice that we came in, waited, then eventually seated ourselves, but she was sincerely apologetic about not hearing us come in, and was always around for the rest of the meal, so we were \"good\" after that.

I normally get some seafood related meal, and of all the choices, they haven't disappointed.  The appetizers are tasty as well, as is the chip salsa.  Margaritas?  Well, you can't go wrong with a good tequila, now can you?

Prices are reasonable, and it's never really crowded when I go in there.  The food is flavorful, but not so spicy that you'll end up with a severe case of \"rumble tum\" later.  Just enough flavor to keep it from being bland,  And it works.

As I've said, I've been over there a few times, and while I don't travel in that area of town too often, at least I know of one decent Mexican food place over there.

My only regret is that I didn't grab a margarita today.  Don't ask why.  I'm still pondering that myself."}
{"text":"Drove past this place so many times. Hidden gem the food here is great and the chips and salsa is fresh"}
{"text":"Good food, great service, nice ambience.
Dinner for two with a cocktail will run about $40. 
It's a nice break from the noisy places with gaming and too-loud music. Authentic food and good drinks!"}
{"text":"This place looked a little sketchy at first glance. Don't be afraid to go inside. Once you are in, you won't regret it. Service was excellent. The salsa is hands down the best I have had in a Mexican restaurant- it is homemade with roasted tomatoes. I had the carne asada tacos and they were so amazing . drinks are top notch. Make sure you get the specialty margarita with Cazadores. I found my go to spot for Mexican in North Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican lunchtime spot. The staff is so friendly and I have never had a bad meal. Be careful about the chips and salsa, they are both excellent, addicting and can easily fill you up (has happened to me on a few occasions). Their taco salad and the seafood grilled flautas are my favorites - I usually order the flautas as my meal and always take half home."}
{"text":"We all loved Que Mas! We both had the combination plates. I had a bean and cheese burrito with a beef taco and a the top shelf margarita with beans and rice. He had the cheese enchiladas with two beef tacos. With rice and beans and churros for dessert. The food was amazing. Anna was our fabulous and friendly server. Anna was delightful. This place is a good find for good Mexican food with excellent customer service. We will be back even though it was a 50 minute drive for this new adventure."}
{"text":"Best chips and salsa!  Love their fajitas. Wish they would open one near Centennial Hills."}
{"text":"This spot is literally a hidden gem ! Authentic Mexican flavor. Good portions on entrée. I'm surprised this spot doesn't have more traffic. Their food tastes so much better than common Mexican restaurants. My husband ordered the seafood burrito and he absolutely loved it. He stated everything had a \"homemade\" taste. I ordered the classic carne asada and it was so juicy. Definitely recommending this spot. Definitely returning."}
{"text":"Anna was so amazing she really made our Mother's Day so much better served us well went above and beyond and we had a ball I really am so grateful for her next time I come she is the person i'm comin to see thankyou for having a great employee like her"}
{"text":"I only gave 4 stars because when I go to Mexican I really like the chips and salsa. I have a very gringo tounge and they didn't have any salsa that was actually mild. The only option was paying for some pico de gallo. It was at least a good size portion of the pico. Also the chimichangas and flautas we ordered were not very crispy. However, the shredded chicken was super flavorful and delicious! Lastly, their fried ice-cream was not very crispy, but had good flavor. Thier flan was delicious, it even changed my mom's mind about flan.  Service was great and always is. We have eaten here before and the chimichangas and flautas have been crispy, for this reason I am only taking away 1 star."}
{"text":"Food was alright, a little over priced for what it was. Service was.... different.  One server was a little rude and another kept coming to pick up plates that we where still eating on."}
{"text":"Food was freshly made!  Very LARGE portions!  Very authentic Mexican food!  I ordered the Carne a  Sada the steak was so tender and cooked to perfection! However the plate was so huge I could not finish it in one sitting!  You can order appetizers but they start you off with homemade chips and salsa!  The guacamole is made fresh and it was delicious!  Place is good for a work lunch and for a date night meal!  You could say it is a hole in the wall but the outside of the building is deceptive compared to what was inside!  Cozy dark setting with subtle music in the background.   The menu is Mexican but it ranges from vegetarian, seafood, pork, chicken and beef.  There is something for everyone!  There was also an assortment of different Margaritas!"}
{"text":"I love the veggie burrito they have here.  It is unlike any other vegetarian burrito I've had before.  The service is great and food is fantastic.  

Do want, do want, do want."}
{"text":"Good Mexican food with family with my auntie, cousin, and future cousin-in-law. Cheese Enchiladas, Chile Rellenos, Carne Asada, and burritos. Margarita was decent. Salsa needed a good kick so we had to request extra Jalapeños."}
