{"text":"I do not usually love Mediterranean food, but wow this place goes above and beyond other similar restaurants I have experienced."}
{"text":"Just go.  You won't be disappointed.  This place has high reviews everywhere for a reason.  Not only is the staff friendly and are happy with what they are doing, but I have not had anything there that I wouldn't have again and again.  The prices are fantastic for the portions.

Just go already!! Stop reading this and trust me"}
{"text":"We had a great meal - loved all the toppings on the gyros and shawarma bowls. Everything was fresh, and my 8-year-old finished a huge gyro. I hope they have enough success to expand to a larger location with indoor seating. We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a dinner to bring back to our hotel on a road trip through town. We looked with dismay at all the chain offerings in town before finding this place, and we are glad we did! Fantastically friendly owner helped us with our orders. The food was fresh and delicious, and we were able to sample a few other treats. If you are on Yelp, you probably care about what you eat more than Boston Pizza and its ilk do - go here!"}
{"text":"Great fresh, tasty and healthy food. The lamb and beef are superb!  Always great and super quick service. Bravo!"}
{"text":"I have been there six times in the last month. The menu is simple and everything is delicious. The only complaint is that he probably could do a better job describing the bowls versus on pita. Other than that small issue (non issue), they are all aces in my book. 

Ask for their specialty hot sauce. It's very good."}
{"text":"Delicious!! Affordable!!! The location this place opened up in was a beloved ice cream joint from my childhood. I was so sad when PJs Dairy Delite closed and for all the years after when the building sat empty I always wished PJs was still around. I wasn't sure how this newcomer would do with Aladdin's having opened down the street prior but it's AMAZING!! A welcome addition for sure! As much as I love Aladdin's, it's nice to contribute to a local business. Did I mention it's delicious?"}
{"text":"Being Lebanese, Aladdin's falls short on a few things.

This place is fantastic. Authentic, fresh and large portions. Everything is served in s chipotle style line. You can add what you'd like and the service is A1.

The employees here are very friendly, will explain everything to you and are just all around awesome.

The hummus here is almost as good as my grandmothers ;) (almost in case she reads this).

If you like your Mediterranean food hot, fresh, authentic and affordable, then this is it."}
{"text":"Seriously, go here today. I love their gyro and my wife swears by the shawarma bowl. Everything is fresh! The pickled veggies, hummus, pita, fries, all of it is fresh! The staff is friendly and very accommodating and the pricing is beyond fair for the huge portions. Try it out today you will not regret it."}
{"text":"I am going to definitely give them another chance. 
I think every place has their off moments.

 Even my place --- (when my daughter baked my chicken with too much rosemary and my chicken salad didn't turn out well..... but I served it anyway.......)

I'm used to a Schawarma being totally wrapped in a thin- larger pita and rolled up tight. 
That aside, the chicken that was in my sandwich was dry and hard. I didn't see him take it off the spit, so it was probably sitting back in the warming tray. 
My husband got the regular gyro. I think they could honestly put more meat on both of these. 

The fries .... should be fried X2 ... to be a bit more crispy. But the seasoning was good. And I think for $4 a serving.... they should load you up. 

I don't want to say negative things about this place. Because obviously they have the good reviews for a reason.  I just think I got them on a off moment. It happens. 
Really nice guys tho. 
I would give them a second chance if I could get fresh meat that time. 
And I didn't realize that \"everything \" literally meant everything. 
Don't let me discourage you from trying them. They put a lot of work into that building with the hoods and ventilation.... very clean. I noticed everything. 
Keep up the good work!!!!"}
{"text":"This gyro is the best I've had in quite some time. Big, juicy chunks of beef and lamb, fresh toppings and fantastic sauce made in-house. I screwed up on my first trip by ordering just a chicken shawarma bowl, but glad I went back for a 2nd try. I'll definitely be going back regularly now."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a Lamb Shawarma at the tables out front on a sunny day. My only concern, why didn't I try this place earlier. Friendly, fast, affordable and authentic great tasty food. This is now on my lunch rotation."}
{"text":"Amazing, quality, affordable food. One of the best places to go in the Falls. Always friendly staff and clean environment."}
{"text":"The Chicken Shawarma and gyro were fantastic. Highly recommend the spicy sauce on the Shawarma it was fantastic. They were really nice too"}
{"text":"This place is a great hidden gem...it didn't look like much from the outside.  The other yelp reviews pulled us in and everyone was completely right! We go to Aladdins frequently and this place gives them a definite run for their money. 

There are only 4 or 5 seats so this is really take home only. 

They have a small case with grab and go items like hummus, grapes leaves and baba ganoush. 

You order at the register similar to a Chipotle...pick your meat, whether you want a bowl or a wrap, your toppings and then your sauce.  I had the chicken shawarma bowl and my husband had the gyro. We also got a side of falafel, grapes leaves, and baba ganoush. We picked up hummus, pita, and tabouleh for a party the next day. 

Price to quantity ratio is crazy here. My chicken shawarma bowl was 8.50 and is at least three meals for me. It came with hummus and a cucumber tomato salad. The flavors were amazing, the sauce was complex and delicate. The pickled veggies added an additional depth.  The hummus is the best I have ever had, dense and smooth with a garlic flavor. I could just eat it with a fork. The grape leaves were amazing, they had a mint flavor that was not to strong with a hint of lemon. I would go back here just for those!

They mentioned in the summer they have outside seating and I can't wait for that!"}
{"text":"Really good, fast casual style Mediterranean food. Pricing is inline with Chipotle, etc and my wife and I can split a bowl for dinner. We're both fat so it's a lot of food. I wish the bread for the Hummus was included, but it's extra."}
{"text":"Excellent food!!! Great flavor and great value for your money. The portions are huge!! Super nice owner. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Super good pita. Fresh and hot out of the oven. Will definitely be returning. Owner very helpful and friendly with offers of samples."}
{"text":"There's a reason this place has great reviews! Everything tastes fresh and the place itself is very clean. The beef/lamb bowl was amazing, served with a side of delicious garlic hummus. Very generous portions at great prices. 

Go try it - you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Very good experience first time in today. Great chicken bowl for lunch I will be back to try other menu items. Everything looked real goo on menu"}
{"text":"SO good. I got the \"bowl\" to go. Rice topped with shawarma, a side of hummus, and a tomato/cucumber salad. Hot sauce and garlic sauce to top it off. Delicious. I ate it for dinner and then left over the next night (and I don't do left overs). I'm a 35 min drive from here but it's worth all the minutes!"}
{"text":"Had the Donair Platter, it's kind of a deconstructed donair with all of the elements on the plate. The flavours are quite good and you can taste each individual item separately. The place isn't fancy but feels homey. I think we'll be back."}
{"text":"Love this place, I'm in Copley, when I went too get a haircut, I saw this small place, yes it's very small, some tables outside, but the food and Service were excellent, and great price, also good baklava"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place... the chicken was super dry, which was basically inedible.
Btw, the hummus was good."}
{"text":"My family and I stopped here on the way to the movies.   The food here was fresh, hot and delicious!

My teens, who swear that pizza is the only worthy pre-movie meal, were skeptical about our attempts to broaden their horizons.

After trying the chicken shawarma, they have decided to add this little restaurant to our take out repertoire.  My oldest declared the bread \"pillows of fluffy goodness\".   The meat was season just right....not too salty and full of flavor.

My husband and I had the gyros.  They were fabulous and topped with fresh vegetables.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food is exceptional! We had the chicken shawarma bowls and everything was so fresh and delicious. They have unique toppings like red onion with sumac and turnips, along with traditional things like lettuce and tomato. The tahini sauce was so good! We will definitely be back. Nice people too!"}
{"text":"Awoooga!!!
Had It brought to me carry out.
Great flavors, spices. Excellent chicken and rice.
Hummus was absolutely perfect. 
I'll be going back. Oh you know I will baby!"}
{"text":"We loved this place for dinner tonight! The portions were huge and the ingredients were fresh! We enjoyed the beef/lamb shawarma bowl with \"everything\" and hummus on the side! Staff was friendly, even ordered online! So great when you're in a rush!! 

The hot sauce and garlic tzatziki were both awesome!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite mediterranean restaurant in the area. Phenomenal hummus and hot sauce. Highly recommend anyone in the area to check this place out."}
{"text":"Great food and nice people.It is a small place. Great gyros"}
{"text":"The first and every time I've been here has been fantastic. Beautiful food with full flavor! I especially appreciate the packaging of their gyro in a container verses smooshed up in foil. I also find it very convenient that the fatoush has the dry pita chips separated so they don't get soggy if you don't eat the whole thing in one sitting. I've never has such full flavored and perfectly cooked (not dried out) gyro meat. It's definitely a fork meal, these portions aren't shy and impossible to just pick up and bite into, easily split into 2 meals. I would eat here every day if I could!"}
{"text":"The staff and owner are excellent, always a warm greeting when I walk in. I came in for the small donair and pop special and have since come back numerous times. The donair is tasty and well wrapped so there isn't a giant mess. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"The menu is simple, but the food is great!  Authentic middle-eastern tastes for a reasonable price.  Take it to go, or sit out on the patio when the weather is nice and enjoy a great meal. I personally recommend the shawarma bowl. Very good!"}
{"text":"This was our next spot on our \"local-exploration tour\", and we were not disappointed. I love small,  family owned businesses with a simple focus on food. The portions are huge and very reasonably priced. It also happens to be 6 minutes from my apartment, which means I'll be visiting very often. This is meant to be a takeaway food spot,  so if you go looking to dine in, space will be limited. However, this doesn't  take away from the fresh, flavorful food that's offered here."}
{"text":"Great food, great portions, good prices, and friendly staff. Highly recommend and will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I've been back several times now, and I'm increasing the rating to a 5 star from a 4. Every time I've been in, the food has been consistently amazing, piping hot, and super fresh. 

I'd recommend going for a large fresh-dough pita, and asking the staff about any food that you're interested in - they're very helpful, and I have yet to have a bad meal here. 

If you're on the fence, just give it a try...you'll thank yourself later!"}
{"text":"Had chicken shawarma bowl with all toppings. Amazing! Great service as well. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"It was ok. I got chicken over rice, rice at the bottom was dried and bland, chicken had almost no taste, was bland and dried up. Salads/veggies were extremely a lot. They do ask if you want everything on it, since it's my first time, I didn't know the amount of veggies they are going to add. They should  at least tell us how much of veggies they are going to add. I feel like there more veggies than rice or chicken."}
{"text":"I don't think anyone understands how excited I was when I found out a Mediterranean spot was going into the old eye sore on Portage Trail, and that it turned out to be friggen DELICIOUS. 

Let's start with the hummus: thick, creamy, smooth, and garlicky. It's the total package. The George Clooney of hummus. It's dreamy. It's made fresh daily. It's addictive and amazing. 

The beef/ lamb shawarma bowl is genius and inexpensive. It's the perfect mix of beef & lamb (which is also halal), rice, and all the fixin's. There's a good selection of \"sides\" to choose from to add into your bowl. 

The Mediterranean chipotle. But better. Healthier. 

They also have wraps, but I haven't ventured that far. I'm too focused on getting lit with the shawarma bowls. 

The owners/ staff are also incredibly friendly and helpful. Even when there's a line out the door (there's always a line out the door) your order comes out super fast. 

Highly recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"The food is phenomenal! Fresh, vibrant and very tasty!  I had the beef-lamb bowl with lettuce instead of rice; my partner had the gyro bowl with rice. Both were traditional style which I recommend as the veggies are all very good and fresh. There are a lot of flavors performing a delightful dance in your mouth. Definitely a gem in Cuyahoga Falls for Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"Simple, fresh food! So delicious. Hummus is amazing and love the option of getting a bowl.  Good sized portions as well. Owners and workers are also super friendly. This restaurant is a great addition to the neighborhood! Great if you want to sit and eat outside or grab something to go."}
{"text":"What an amazing first experience!  We got 2 gyros and a chicken gyro. The topping selections were a fantastic surprise.  I loved the diced cucumber and tomatos.  I also got a fattoush salad that I will be saving for later because the meals were so filling.  The fries have a great seasoning to them (although they could be cooked a little longer). Everyone working was very nice and helpful and everything was very clean!"}
{"text":"The only shawarma I loved was in Canada at the place called, Osmos. This is now my new favorite...So glad something competitive opened here in Ohio! Happy & glad that I tried & going again soon !"}
{"text":"Simple, easy menu. Order on the left side and pick up on the right. It can get pretty busy in their small customer area so be patient. I've been there a few times and have always had great service and food. I really like their falafel. Their hummus isn't my favorite, but my kids really like it. I think they use smoked paprika, which adds great flavor. You'll need to buy pita for the hummus, but their prices are really good so buy a whole bag. The fattoush is a pretty big serving and the gyros are overflowing with meat! I was surprised by how big they are for the price! This will be a regular carry-out place for me and my family. Glad to have them in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service. The chef/owner was incredibly friendly, but not overbearing. The fries and falafel were very fresh! My only complaint is all the styrofoam and disposable containers- I'm hopeful that after they are more established they will have plates, silverware, etc."}
{"text":"We popped in Shawarma Brothers on a whim one afternoon. The smell immediately grabs your attention upon walking in. It hits you in the face, you immediately start drooling, and want one of everything. 

We got a gyro and a chicken shawarma. They are very generous on their portions! I love so much how friendly and helpful they were. Answering a couple questions I had and walking me through building both of my items. The meats are tender, juicy, and have so much flavor! All the added veggies and sauces are what push these over the edge. They feel so fresh and don't make you feel heavy or weighed down after eating it. 

The lamb (naturally) had a richer flavor profile than the chicken but my husband and I were tossed up which we liked better. I'm not sure how they're making money selling these giant things for $6- but we'd happily pay double. 

Go get you some shawarma!"}
{"text":"Love this place. excellent food. good prices friendly owners and staff. I love the baklava too. The chicken and beef shwarma are equally delicious."}
{"text":"Good food, and the portions are enormous.    I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I had the chicken Shawarma and it comes with humus, cucumbers, tomato and beer root. It was delicious and made when I ordered it. For $5 it was a large portion and the French fries were seasoned well making them really tasty. Inside they only have a 3 bar seats available, so I took my order to go and went to Giant Eagle down the block to eat it with a drink.

I went back on 7/10/17 and the prices have gone up, but it's still tasted great. I actually liked it a bit better since the now cut the tomato slices thicker."}
{"text":"Delicious! My husband and I went here on our way to Blossom. Quick food, wonderful service, super delicious. I was so disappointed I couldn't take my leftovers bc it was too warm to leave them in the car the whole night. I've been craving more chicken shawarma ever since we went here."}
{"text":"This place has the first good baklava I've had in Ohio. Their gyros are delicious, authentic, and HUGE with a wide array of toppings to choose from. What an excellent introduction to falafel. The staff is SUPER friendly and social. Do yourself a favor and come here!"}
{"text":"Amazing gyro and baklava!   Very generous with little extra pita.  Wish I lived closer. Everything was delicious, fast, and healthy for a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"The food was so delicious! We stopped in a little after 7 on a Saturday night. I've heard good things about this place so I have been itching to try it. I love Aladdin's Eatery and am a big fan of Mediterranean food, but I was still a little worried about the menu because it's so small. The workers were SO helpful and nice, answering all my questions about the sauces and sides. I got a bowl and my bf got a wrap, both chicken. The portion sizes are huge (chipotle size) for the price and the food was so good. To be honest the chicken was really dry, but we were there right before closing and I assumed it would be, so I was prepared. It had great flavor still though, even for being dried out. The customer service was great the food was good and the staff is really friendly. If you have a question about something just ask! I can't wait to make this place a regular stop."}
{"text":"Always very satisfied and it's always better than I remember it somehow. The chicken shawarma in a pita is seriously amazing. Chicken is sooo good. I get garlic sauce, lettuce, onion (soo many more toppings to choose) and the pita is quite literally the best ever. It's thick and fluffy. Fries and falafel are prepared and fried fresh when you order."}
{"text":"Nice little locally owned middle eastern joint that makes killer shawarma sandwiches.  Huge and full of great flavor!!  The falafel however was a bit dry for me.  That said, he might not move enough of the falafel to justify Making it often.  The shawarma however is a ten. ;)"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!! Ordered from here while in town for work. I ordered a gyro bowl and fattoush salad. It was a TON of food. I couldn't even finish half the bowl and my hand got tired from holding it up AND I didn't even get to the salad.

The guy who took my order also delivered and even brought it up to my room (usually delivery doesn't want to come up) which is a major plus bc im usually in pjs as soon as i walk in my hotel room.

It was only $14.75 for the bowl (which also came with hummus and a small salad), a (big ass) fattoush and a soda, with delivery. The guy refused to take a tip which I really wanted to give him but he refused, smiled and walked away. And business traveler bonus, they take Amex.

This will most definitely be a regular dinner spot for me while on this project!!"}
{"text":"Had the falafel, beef/lamb sandwich, and fries. All were very good. The sandwich was huge and overflowing. Service was great. Only suggestions: either put a little less filling in the sandwich or split it into two and use recyclable carry out boxes."}
{"text":"This place was delicious. The guys in charge were very kind and explained what the food comes with and how it's prepared. It's pretty small, but really big on flavor. The hummus tastes very fresh and the cucumber salad was tangy, sweet and light. They have a few different sauces added into a bowl which are great. I got the chicken bowl with garlic and hot sauce. The hot sauce will get you for a second, but it's more good flavor than heat. 
Highly recommend It!"}
{"text":"Try the falafel, it's fantastic! I try and eat here at least once a week. Food always taste great. Get some hummus too."}
{"text":"Was on vacation looking at homes in N.E. Ohio and my Real Estate person recommend this spot , what a great recommendation the food was great very flavorful and the hummus wow some of the best I have had in a while I live in L.A. and I have had alot of Shawarma and this rivals anything I have had here , great job I look forward to eating at your restaurant many times after I move back."}
{"text":"It was ok. Food wasn't bad but not stellar either, middle of the road. It's clean, and wasn't crowded. Value for money is good. Service was a bit aloof, but not rude, I personally don't need warm and fuzzy juat to pickup food, but since the other reviews mentioned it, I figured I would include it. Overall, not bad but I probably won't be back, just didn't wow me. You may feel differently Give it a try."}
{"text":"This is a great little spot to get some food. Take out mostly no real seating but you have got to try this place. Service is first class and very friendly and the food is excellent. Aladdins needs to watch out because this place is going to take off. Quality of both service and food is so much better than them. This place is a must try and I hope that in the future they can expand so you can eat in! Prices are great as well!"}
{"text":"Absolutely great food!!! You can't find an item that isn't top notch quality and tastes amazing"}
{"text":"Incredible. Authentic. Flavorful. Right price. Go eat here, I was recommended by a friend because I love Aladdin's and she was so right! This is a hidden gem."}
{"text":"We came in around 7:00 on a Thursday and there wasn't a line. The tables out front were open so we were able to eat there. I loved that you can get a lot of bang for your buck, the prices are great. The guys working were very friendly too.

The highlight of our meals was the falafel. It's homemade, not something frozen they throw in a fryer. I also loved that gyro meat was off a spit, not rubbery pre- frozen slices like you get at most places. It was a bunch of big, tender pieces of meat. 

If you order a bowl, you get rice, hummus, your meat/vegan option of choice and as many toppings as you want."}
{"text":"I stopped in about a month ago on a whim. I had been dying to try this place for awhile, and was so glad I finally did. I ordered a gyro and fries. The portions were HUGE! My husband and I ended up splitting the meal, which was only 9 bucks! The gyro meat was a little too thick for my liking... I like it sliced a little thinner but it was delicious anyhow. The fries were amazing. And the service was awesome. The owner was pleasant, friendly and greeted me immediately upon entering, despite being a little busy."}
{"text":"This place is small it usually has a line and is amazing. The line goes fast they are friendly, the humus is fresh and delicious. The menu is small and every thing on it is great. It is deffinentaly worth checking out."}
{"text":"Originally would have gave this place 4 stars but they upped their prices. Their gyro although very authentic and well cooked, (crispy, bark like exterior, tender inside) does not provide enough meat to be considered enough for a meal. But at $5 it was hard to complain about portion size. But they upped it to $6 while keeping the same small portion of meat. The fries while fresh cut and deep fried in front of you have a feeling my aftertaste as if the oil hasn't been changed in a while and they upped the price of an order of those from $2 to $3. So now a gyro and fry will run you $9 instead of $7 and unless you recently ate or plan on eating again soon afterward you will have spent $9 and will still be hungry. Very nice family runnin an authentic food stand is good enough to bump my review from 2 to 3 stars"}
{"text":"Just moved here from LA and this is the best shawarma place I've had here yet. My new go to place when I'm craving middle eastern food. I substituted rice for lettuce and it was the perfect post gym meal. Everything was fresh and delicious. The hummus was amazing and a lot of garlic - like I like it. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Hmmmm why do I feel as though these great reviews were written by friends and family?! Take one step inside and you can instantly see that the place isn't very clean or well kept. Also, along the outside is all windows and you can see the disarray in the back. 

My bf and I ordered two shawarma's that were very average. We also grabbed a chocolate bar from near the cash for dessert and it was expired, the chocolate had turned white.

I went back in because I heard they sell those amazing Lebanese pies. I ordered one cheese and one meat. I watched, a little disgusted & disappointed, as he pulled them out of the freezer and threw them in the microwave. Yuck. Not fresh at all, that's for sure. Who would ever want that?!? 5 stars my A$$! 

As a comparison, there is a place in Ottawa I used to always visit that makes amazing pies! They are pre made but very fresh, not frozen. When you order one, they bake it in a wood oven right in front of you and they are delish! Now that's how it's done! 

I don't get the feeling that anything here is fresh. If they are willing to microwave your food right in front of you, they clearly don't care too much about quality. The people seemed nice, it's not personal. 

I won't be back."}
{"text":"Totally fresh, absolutely beautiful presentation, and they deliver!!! I ordered felafel appetizer, chicken shawarma bowl and a gyro (pita) whole order cost less than 20...will definitely order again and will recommend. Also the delivery kid was super polite, tried to refuse my tip lol!"}
{"text":"Once you try Shawarma Brothers, you'll crave it all the time! Every time I go, I order the Gyro Bowl with banana peppers, and it never gets old!"}
{"text":"Greeted warmly by owner in the small restaurant bearing beef pocket samples. Delicious. Ready for the main event we ordered a medium beef and medium chicken shawarma. Owner offered us the standard pita but recommended fresh dough. Figuring anything fresh is always better, we took him up on his recommendation and weren't disappointed. Fresh ingredients we loaded to our request and then baked in the oven. A short 5 minutes later our shawarma was ready. Light golden brown crust, flakey inside with lots of beef and chicken. Owner made sure we were pleased with everything and then gave us some extra treats for the road. Do yourself a favour and try this spot out for reasonable prices and fantastic flavours."}
{"text":"The ratings are not lying. This place is amazing! Everything is fresh and the portions are plentiful. I had the falafel bowl with everything and I also added the baklava for dessert. I will definitely be back!  Service was very friendly and the only downside is there is no where to sit."}
{"text":"Just stopped here to grab a quick lunch.  Was blown away by the food and friendly service.  And it is spotless."}
{"text":"After a long long time of people telling us that we absolutely had to try this place, we did! And wow was it amazing! The portions were huge and the quality was on point! The customer service was great too!"}
{"text":"The owner Yassin, is awesomely friendly, and this chicken shawarma is the best I've ever had.  Truly amazing.  The lettuce and tomatoes are fresh, the rice is great, and the chicken is grilled perfectly."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and it was excellent. The food was fresh and customer service was very good. This is going to be my new favorite spot to eat whenever I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place to eat in the Falls area. They are super nice and helpful if you are a first time visitor. The food is fresh and prepared when you order. It's a very clean establishment and parking is a breeze. Make sure you check it out! It's going to be a place I go regularly from now on. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"The portions are generous and the food is delicious.  Awesome option for a quick carry out dinner!"}
{"text":"I had the beef lamb shawarma and it was delicious. I liked that I had the option of customizing the toppings. The meat was well cooked and the toppings were fresh. The tabouli was fresh and flavorful. The 2 sisters who own it are very friendly and were great to talk to. I'm excited to go back and try a gyro."}
{"text":"First time here. Everyone was very friendly. Food didn't come out the fastest but the costumer service and quality of the food was 5 star."}
{"text":"Love this place! You can tell the food is always fresh and made with care. Highly recommend supporting this local business!"}
{"text":"Sooo delicious! Went there for the first time for lunch, a line and people waiting to get in! Thats a good sign that the food is amazing! 
The bowl is big enough for at least 2 meals. The garlic sauce is really good and just this side of the line of too much garlic. 
Make sure you come early though- we hit this place before closing on a saturday night as well and they were sold out of food! (Its that good!)"}
{"text":"Best gyro I have ever had. Waiting for them to make kibble. Everything is by far better than Aladdins. I live on Hummus. Grape leaves are great. Good baba. Headed there now. Two days in a row."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Lots of options at this fast casual place and the veggies were very fresh. We ate outside and they were closing and they asked if we needed anything else which was above and beyond.  Very good service and food overall!"}
{"text":"Best chicken shawarma I have ever had in a while.   Great service too.  I love that there are tons of toppings."}
{"text":"Wonderful! In town for work, saw \"gyros\" and had to give it a shot... Delicious food, huge portions, and great staff. I'll be going back, and I'd definitely recommend it to ANYONE!"}
