{"text":"The chopped beef sandwich was awesome. Big portion, and very nicely seasoned. The quarter chicken was good, but we expected a breast and a wing but got a thigh and leg. We prefer a half chicken, but this isn't available. The meat is very good. The sides were not good. We had the potato salad, the \"white\" slaw and Mac and cheese. All meh."}
{"text":"You must go hear if you want Cue in the Concord area.  You will be full and leave happy.  'Nuff said.  Oh - there might be a line.  But yes the service is excellent.  You can achieve meat sweats here with 1 order. Or you can take some home :).
I went here for dinner with some friends - it was 4 months ago now.  Should have gone back by now!"}
{"text":"One of the best BBQ places I've eaten at in a long time. Portions are huge. Brisket was tender, greens had gobs of pulled pork in them, great selection of sauces. Place was packed. Ate @ 6:30 Saturday night and had a 30 minute wait to order. It was worth the wait. Will be back when in the area again next year. Don't wait too long in the day to get there as they apparently only make a set amount of food and when they are out, they are out."}
{"text":"Best barbeque around.  The sauces are fabulous!  Large portions.  Cornbread is unbelievable."}
{"text":"It's no Lexington Style BBQ, but it's ok. A bit pricy for my taste though."}
{"text":"Smoke Pit is by far THE BEST BBQ in our area and its not even close!"}
{"text":"Freshly made, ribs to die for, BBQ chix very good, and the cornbread is banging '. Come early on the weekend for they run out of meat. Nice new joint in town. Downside, sweet potato fries were cold - ugh!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Concord, NC
and great service."}
{"text":"Excellent bbq! Had brisket not to tender not too tough it's a delicate balance and they did it right ! Sauce was very spicy!  Also had ribs again not too fall off bone just tender enough to rip from the bone and excellent smokey flavor!  Waitress quickly dropped off the trays of food and was never heard from again, but  then again you go there for food not service !  Ohh and lastly, portions are enormous.   Only the really big eater will finish the entire meal at one sitting."}
{"text":"Had the 8 bones wet ribs, collards, beans, and cornbread.  All of it was excellent.  I can't wait to digest this then head right back again.  I can't tell you what my wife ate because as soon as they set down that tray, I got in to the zone.  Keep your arms and legs safely inside the ride and don't get too close to my tray!  You have got to try this place."}
{"text":"Absolutely DELICIOUS food. Quality service, large portions for the price & leaves your stomach happy! If you have the chance, stop in and try it- the lines can be long but that really just proves its worth it."}
{"text":"This place is great! Everything is really good. Only negative is that brisket is hit or miss. I've had it when it's the best I've had, lots of charring and very tender and juicy and others when it is very lean and dry. With more consistency it would be hard to beat! Wings and pulled pork are very good too. And cobblers are delish"}
{"text":"Wow!!  This is hands down the best BBQ I've had in NC."}
{"text":"We've been to the smoke pit twice now and have had an array of food (big family).  Every one of the plates has been excellent flavor and cooked right.  We love the food and the staff is very friendly.  The restaurant itself is undefined.  It is counter order much like a fast food or buffet, but then if you choose to eat in they will bring you your food and it turns into \"almost\"  like a full service restaurant.  There are a few people who walk around who may or may not be waitresses.  It is somewhat confusing.  When you first order, if you are using a credit card, they have the latest greatest register which the screen turns around and you sign the actual register screen itself.  However, you cannot simply just sign. You first must choose what percentage, if any, of a tip you would like to give.   It is hard to distinguish if a tip is necessary for someone who just took your order at a register.  Do you tip at KFC after you order your bucket of extra crispy?  Makes you feel a bit obligated too, and when you click no tip do they make you wait on your plates since they come from the back?  After you sit down and they bring your plates, then they start acting like a waitress!  But if you want a fork you have to get up to the self-serve area and get one, same for a drink, but then the girls come by and asked if all is ok and do you need anything?  Do I wait for the waitress to ask for extra bbq sauce or do I get up and go to the counter to ask?  The decision has to be made each time you need something.  This is a new restaurant and the food is delicious, just need to define what style service and I believe it will be a home run!"}
{"text":"Great B-B-Q!!!  Just happened by on our way through town.  Shared a large pulled pork combo with the wife.  Went a way fully satisfied."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try something different so we went to the smoke pit . We walked in and were greeted. We take a moment to look at the menu and finally decided what we wanted. We proceeded to pay and then noticed that it was the new technology swivel register. The cashier asked if we wanted to leave a tip. For what? Taking our order. We sat down fixed our own drinks about ten minutes later our food was brought out the portions were huge. I got the pulled chicken with beans. The beans were loaded with onions but still decent. My boyfriend got the pick two: burnted chicken and barbecue brisket with mac and cheese and beans. The mac and cheese was excellent. The whole time no one came over to the table we had to get our own carry out containers. Overall nice place, great food and decent prices just no service everything is pretty much self service."}
{"text":"Food was good.  Had burnt ends sandwich with baked beans.  Granted it was at lunch, but didn't care about having to stand in line to order before finding place to sit.  Rule about not saving tables not uniformly enforced.  Not enough tables available."}
{"text":"I've been all over North Carolina trying different types of BBQ and I'm so happy that the best place I've been is local. I haven't had a thing there that I didn't love! The portions are quite large and the atmosphere is cool. 

It's usually pretty busy but the lines move quickly, so don't be discouraged by the line, it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Interesting mom and pop BBQ place. During peak hours, table space is at premium and you may find yourself with standing room only.

The brisket meat was good, but they use a dry rub and I found the seasoning overly salty. The sweet potato fries were authentic and good but a little cold. The amount of brisket we got was a very hearty portion. 

We got our sandwiches with the \"fixens\" on the side as it came with hot sauce and coleslaw. The coleslaw was in a runny hot sauce and not to my liking. In addition, the BBQ sauce we got on the side was also overly spicey.

Sweet tea was decent and the peach crisp for desert was delicious.

If you like heavily seasoned BBQ and spicey hot BBQ sauce this place is right up your alley; if not, meal may be too much to handle for the price."}
{"text":"I grew up in Lexington, NC so I have a deep appreciation for BBQ and this place is home away from home.  Huge servings (so don't be scared of the price), most people could split a 2 or 3 meat plate with no problems, we do!  Sides are great and their BBQ slaw is unique and flavorful!  BBQ beans are cooked with pulled pork and sweet potato casserole makes you think of thanksgiving.  They offer a variety of sauces on the table and additional sauces for your wing or chicken quarter order.  Get there early or you can expect a wait.  Seating is limited but outside seating is offered.  Once they are sold out of an item for the day, that's it.  I always recommend the brisket, pulled pork, or chicken (wings or quarters)."}
{"text":"The burnt ends are an absolute must each time I visit."}
{"text":"If there was one type of food that would best represent the United States of America I would vote for BBQ. Whether you're a KC, Texas, NC, or Memphis BBQ fan, The Smoke Pit is definitely a contender. While I'm not the biggest fan of NC style BBQ The Smoke Pit showcases the different elements of BBQ in it's entirety. 

I saw all the rave reviews on Yelp so I decided to take a trip with my family. When we arrived the parking lot was full and there was a line almost to the door. As we inched our way up the line we eventually saw the sign that listed what items were already sold out for the day. As a result, I ordered the three meat BBQ combos which consisted of chicken quarters, Texas brisket, and St. Louis style ribs while my two sides were the mac & cheese and pork baked beans. 

The dining area is a large open room with various tables strewed about. After waiting about 10-15 mins our food was delivered on cafeteria style trays on top of red butcher paper. Personally, I love it when my BBQ is served on butcher paper because it reminds me of the good ole Lone Star. All of the food was awesome because it correctly reflected the different regions of American BBQ. My only slight gripe was the white sauce on the chicken quarters. While the white sauce did compliment the chicken, there was a bit too much of it which kind of detracted from the natural taste of the chicken.

All in all, The Smoke Pit is a MUST if you're ever down in the Charlotte/Concord area. Simplistic to it's core, The Smoke Pit proves that the delictable art of barbeque is alive and well at 796 Pkwy N."}
{"text":"My first time here I got the 4 rib meal with coleslaw and sweet potato casserole. The ribs were done to perfection and the meat pulled off the bone effortlessly.  I got them wet and the BBQ sauce had the right amount of tang and sweetness. The sweet potato casserole was the best and the coleslaw made it complete.  Portions are big and my meal was more then enough for me.  This is the go to place for BBQ....."}
{"text":"My husband and I now keep The Smoke Pit in our back pockets for when guests or company comes to town and we want to show off Concord. We know that going at peak times mean that the lines will be long but the food is worth it! The portions are huge (I mean two full meals worth of left overs huge) and the flavor is great."}
{"text":"This place is the best BBQ in Concord if not the entire Charlotte area.  Portions are huge.  Not sure what else you'd want in a rib joint.  They care about what they do and it shows.  Come early because the line is out the door!"}
{"text":"Wow! First visit to Smoke Pit and Stock Market. What a treat. We are regulars at another BBQ place but this food is the best BBQ, brisket and cornbread I have ever had! Huge portions. And it is busy because it's so popular and well received. I got there at 2 and all the tables were full. 
Don't miss this one if your up that way on 29 near Popular Tent Road."}
{"text":"After reading some of the other comments I feel like I should try again at a different time. 

I waited an exceptional amount of time on a BBQ sandwich and fries and what I received was not what I expected. 

My pulled pork was dry, it had great flavor but I had to drench it in sauce to make it chewable! My sweet potato fries were seasoned well but cold. 

I was excited but  now I am severely disappointed!"}
{"text":"Incredible BBQ!  I had the four meat platter and could not eat it all. Had enough for lunch the next day, making it a great value.

Being a native North Carolinian, I usually look harshly at the words barbecue and beef being used in the same sentence. Here in NC,  it is heresy to refer to any food as Barbecue other than pork cooked over hickory wood coals. 

However, in my travels I've had the opportunity to experience the barbecue beef as found in Texas and Oklahoma. What I found here in my meal at the Smoke Pit was beef better than that experienced in Texas and almost as good as that enjoyed in Oklahoma.

Usually at most restaurants -when looked closely with a critical eye- one can find some item that is not quite up to standard. Not here! Food quality, food quality, service, and atmosphere everything perfect. Manager comes and speaks with every table when I was there, very personable guy.

Looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Best bbq around, I enjoyed the pulled pork plate and my husband loved his burnt ends sandwich. We were also treated to enthusiastic and efficient service by Amy in the seating area."}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ and great food. Service was great as well. Very busy so plan to wait and be patient because the food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"The Service when placing take out orders is getting bad on 2 different occasions I tried to call in a order all I got was a busy signal. When I arrived 25 minutes later. calling the whole way there.  ( I live 20 minutes away) I asked if there phone was out of order they said no and it was found in the back pocket of one of the cashiers turned on. Ok crap happens. I would think with the kind of bussiness that they do someone would have noticed that the phone was not ringing. Tonight I was out and decided to pick up dinner started calling on my way there  20 minutes later I pull into the parking lot still a busy call. I walk in ask about the phone and was told the Mgr or owner was on it and told the cashiers he needed more then them.  WOW. On all 3 occasions I never received a apology. It seemed like were so busy if you don't like it go some where else attidude. I will say that the food is awesome. But they need to pay more attention to the customer service."}
{"text":"Stopped in this place by chance for the first time a few months ago and every time since has been completely on purpose! 
This time I had the BlueChicken Salad, this delicate sounding salad was amazing! Packed with flavor!  Smoked Blueberry BBQ Sauced Chicken, smoked bacon bits(more like bacon chunks) corn, tomatoes, Blue Cheese Crumbles (more like blue cheese chunks), and sweet fresh plump blueberries all on a bed of chopped romaine!
I might guess to say this is the salad they serve in heaven ! 
Parking can be tricky as the lot is usually full and we usually get a parking spot as someone else is leaving. It is worth the trouble to wait for a parking place. The food score is high, the employees are all very nice and the order first then sit system works very well for flow of open tables. Do yourself a favor and stop in.
Don't forget to check out the store next door too!"}
{"text":"Simply the bomb. Great food, great staff and a wonderful experience.  I love bbq and this place flat out has it. I have yet had something on the menu I have not enjoyed."}
{"text":"A little pricey but well worth it. You get a lot of food and it was really good. Don't get the Texas toast, it's not Texas toast it's normal toasted bread, get the corn bread instead!"}
{"text":"I think it has been voted the best restaurant in Concord. If you are into comfort food and smokey awesomeness then stop looking. You have found it. 
Be prepared to wait in line at peak times. It's worth it."}
{"text":"The most difficult thing about eating at this place is making a decision on what to order.  All the food is absolutely delicious and the people who work there are friendly."}
{"text":"Good food - but always out of at least 2-3 menu items... And when they run out of X - they just close. I've been there multiple times on a Saturday at 5:00 and it looks like they had been closed for hours. Not worth the wait or the multiple trips to find the restaurant closed."}
{"text":"I have been to The Smoke Pit twice. I ordered the beef brisket with greens, macaroni and cheese and cornbread. The beef brisket melts in your mouth!!! The rest on my meal was delicious.....just season to taste. The cornbread has pieces of corn in it and has a crispy crust. The portions are enough for 2 people. There is something on the menu for everyone!!! Try this place out. You will NOT be disappointed!!!!"}
{"text":"Intown for event (not race weekend) and the great reviews caught my attention.  Arrived at 5:30 pm on Saturday to beat crowd. Place was already packed. Sign on door said CLOSED but we went in because looked open. An employee standing inside the door told us they were closed because they \"ran out of food\"... not an item, the entire menu. So one star is for operations not food (since I didn't get any food). Call ahead and make sure they still have food"}
{"text":"I am a vegetarian and my husband isn't. My husband has loved everything he's tried here and there's a blueberry barbecue chicken salad that's excellent without the chicken! The sides are excellent also.  Great sweet potato fries and mac n cheese.  The service is friendly and the line moves quicker than you would expect.  We've learned to arrive as early as possible to avoid the wait."}
{"text":"This place had the best BBQ in Concord.  I have been here a couple of times and have not been disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times and bbq was pretty good. Today it tasted like it came from a crockpot at a gas station.I hope the quality doesn't go down as they pre-cook for crowds."}
{"text":"The food here is the best ever. Nobody dies a brisket like they do.
The only negative about this place is that it's always so busy.  So go at unpopular times - if there are any."}
{"text":"Delicious bbq. Had the pulled chicken, Mac and cheese, corn bread and white coleslaw. Everything was perfect. Wish i could bring this place back to NH with me. My son had the pulled pork and savored every bite. Very impressed."}
{"text":"This barbecue is AMAZING!!! The lines are always out the door but the wait is more than worth it. The atmosphere is vibrant and classic with lots of delicious smells coming from outside. They have a real barbecue grill and this is not fake at all. This place has the most tender meat anywhere and it is soooo good. This is the best barbecue I could ever have. The sauces are good, but not needed due to the juicy nature of the meat itself. The meats are perfectly cooked and seasoned. This place has very fair portions with friendly staff and fair prices as well. The Smoke Pit is a must visit place!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ Place with southern hospitality. The pork BBQ had an excellent smoke taste and great texture. Highly recommend. The sides were great and the BBQ sauce is great vinegar NC flavor."}
{"text":"The brisket and pulled pork is the best in town! The servers and staff at the counter were extremely friendly and attentive. The line is long which tells me everyone wants some! The wait is worth it, so come hungry! My only suggestion would be to label the barbecue sauce bottles. My mother put some really hot sauce on her sandwich! But I finished it for her. It was great!"}
{"text":"My wife and i stopped in this joint on a recommendation from some friends. Let me say thanks friends the best kept secret in NC. THE BBQ was to die for i had the burnt ends sandwich with a side of deviled egg potato salad ! Amazing!  My wife had the BBQ pulled pork platter double wow. The food was on point and so was the price! If you have family in town bring them here for dinner our lunch! BBQ nirvana!"}
{"text":"extremely friendly and attentive staff but only mediocre barbeque. 
the smoked ends and ribs were fatty and lacked any smoked flavor.
the white coleslaw was very vinegary and the fries were decent.

that's all folks!"}
{"text":"Wow!  I was very impressed. I had the 4 meat platter and shared it. 

Its a TON of food and all A+ taste."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. The prices are in line with restaurants in the area. Sometimes the line gets too long so I have to go elsewhere if I am in a hurry. But I will wait if I am not in a hurry. They have another location in Salisbury as well and I get the same great food and service at both locations."}
{"text":"We were very disappointed with our first and last trip to The Smoke Pit.  The Pulled Chicken on the sandwiches was extremely dry.  The chicken tasted reheated, like it was cooked days ago and taken out of the frig.  Don't expect to taste nicely smoked, moist chicken.  The heavy rub they put on it overpowers the dry chicken.  They left the slaw that is supposed to come on the sandwiches off as well."}
{"text":"Wow!  Excellent food, enormous portions and great service.  What more can you ask for!"}
{"text":"Ok,...first off,...I grew up in NC,..and have since moved to Atlanta GA. I miss the good BBQ back in the Carolina's.
With that said, today had to be some of the best BBQ I've had in years!!!! Service was amazing, (joking with the cashier, food delivered to my table and asked if everything looks right/good,...a different lady came by and asked had I been in before, what did I order, etc. )
I can't say enough good about this place. Was so good, I got a pound of pulled pork to go! I would def drive out of the way to get back to this place. Short drive off of 85,...not far at all....Check it out,...you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Very large portions. Best thickest, and best tasting sliced brisket I ever had. We drove from Raleigh, about 3 hours, and were not disappointed. It was well worth the trip. Just good BBQ food."}
{"text":"This place is wayyyyyyy over rated. Mediocre bbq joint equivalent to any other bbq place in NC. There is no servers and the atmosphere is a bit chaotic."}
{"text":"First time on this place, and my jab dropped when I saw the serving portions. They are huge and the food was DELICIOUS, definitely will come back again to try another plates."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Best bbq I have ever had!! Hands down.. got to try the Alabama sauce! Only thing that I would like to see is an actual service instead of cafeteria style."}
{"text":"I'm a Texan and may be a bit of a snob about brisket.  Stopped in here because the parking lot was full and...........BLOWN AWAY!!!  I'm 50 and have never tasted brisket this good.  I had my Alabama rep with me and he has had brisket once. Too dry.  I saw it go by to another table and convinced him to try it again. He's a huge fan now and I'm a little ashamed that these guys make the best brisket ever. Please tell me you're transplants from Texas. Phenomenal!!!"}
{"text":"Meh...I was expecting amazing BBQ and it's just ok. The food is good but not amazing. The brisket was dry, which was a real disappointment. Portions are huge and the place is clean, with very friendly staff."}
{"text":"A coworker and I stopped in for lunch. I've been here before but didn't post a review so here it is. I only come to Charlotte once or twice a year but must come here first. 
This place is BBQ at its finest!  Only minutes from Charlotte Motor Speedway. I can't say enough about the quality, taste and portions.  Amanda was amazing and took very good care of us.  Till next time The Smoke Pit.  5 Stars!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Bar none the best BBQ around. The brisket is tender and juicy. The costmer service is very good."}
{"text":"The pulled pork is fantastic, service is really great.  Portions are huge.  Broccoli casserole was so so, potato salad had potential, but was very runny and the potatoes were hard.  I'm sure many folks would rate this a 5, it's just not my thing.  I would recommend it to try for yourself."}
{"text":"Loved the Smoke Pit! While we had to wait for about 25 minutes-it was definitely worth the wait! The line speaks for itself-everyone wants some of this delicious barbecue and fixins. I had the pulled pork plate and the most amazing sweet potato casserole. It's clean and wait staff are attentive and welcoming."}
{"text":"We live in Davidson and took the 30 minute car ride to try The Smoke Pit for lunch because of the great reputation it carries. Here are our impressions - 1. it is Ok BBQ. The pulled pork was very good but the brisket  (2 meat platter) was too dry. The stuffed potato was HUGE and as a result was too cool in the middle (a bit underdone) to really enjoy. The sides (okra and sweet tater fries) were good, but again not right \"out of the fryer hot\" like you'd hope.Three sauces HOT/SWEET/Vinegar were tasty and fresh. 2. It is expensive - $18 for the two meat platter and $11 for the spud.  3. Portion size helps with the cost point as we could barely finish 1/2 our meals. We have enough for a full second meal each.  4. - It gets crowded fast. We got there 5 minutes before a line formed and that line was out the door as we left 45 minutes later. Given that it is 30 minutes away, it is unlikely we will visit again, but if you are in the area, and it's not noon, you should give it a try."}
{"text":"I guess its just a matter of preference. I ate here for the first time and after hearing so much about the place, I was really excited to give it a shot. I ordered ribs ( I always judge a good BBQ spot by the quality of their ribs!) I got them back to my office and was actually shocked to find the ribs dry and well overcooked. I chalked this up as somehow getting a bad batch, so I called the store and the young lady was very nice- she apologized and offered me a rain check. She assured me that this wasn't the norm. So today I went back to give it another go. I got the ribs back to my office, and to my dismay I got the same dried, tough, jerky type ribs!!! I guess its their style of cooking them- like the whole 'burnt ends' concept. I had a coworker try them, and her words were \"this is not edible!\".  I enjoy ribs that are tender and juicy. Not necessarily falling off the bone, but eager to do so if you catch my drift. I give it two stars: One for the effort, the other for the awesome customer service I received when ordering on both occasions."}
{"text":"Ok ... What BBQ they had was delish but they were sold out of brisket, burnt ends, Mac and cheese and ribs in a Monday night at 6.  Took us an hour to order and get a seat..."}
{"text":"It was excellent food! I got the smoked chicken leg quarters with fried okra and potato salad and it was amazing!  I will for sure be returning back there!! Fast friendly service!!"}
{"text":"Not impressed however will go back to try something else. Ordered beef brisket and ribs. I did not care for the dry ribs.  I had a side of sweet sauce. The sweet sauce was actually tasty but I didn't care for the rub. The beef brisket was somewhat dry and salty. Side items were collard greens and Mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese was ok.. Definitely homemade however the collards needed more seasonings. I must say customer service was EXCELLENT!!!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've had! Was a little disappointed after a hard day of work that there wasn't any beer, but it was still amazing!"}
{"text":"Busy place, got there line down the sidewalk. Waited at least thirty minutes. Finally ordered sat down food came in just a few minutes. It is a meat lovers dream. We had pulled pork, ribs,and beef brisket. It was worth the wait. Sauces were excellent as well as the sweet potato casserole. Yum yum.
Still the best brisket I have ever had. The sweet sauce is to die for
 The sweet potato casserole is like a Thanksgiving explosion in your mouth. Love this place."}
{"text":"The Smoke Pit is kind of hard to find - mainly because it sits off the road & the parking lot is always full of cars!  In fact, parking can be a problem depending on when you are there.   Stood in line for about 15 minutes - and all parties must stand in line; no sending one to save a table & someone else places an order.  That's fine; not a problem - but because seating is limited, they need to do something about the people who were finished with their meal & just sitting there talking; two businessmen, a table of old guys and a lady with a computer were the obvious offenders that day.  They were there when we got there & they were still there when we left.

Anyway, as to the food.  Ordered our standby pulled pork sandwich with one side; one okra and one fries.  The sandwich was out of this world good, with a bunch of tender meat and a fresh bun!  Unfortunately, the okra was on the almost burnt side and the fries were your standard frozen restaurant fries.  If they spent a bit more attention to their sides, it would be a five star treat!"}
{"text":"First time there. Friendly employees, clean place, great food and portions. Only thing I didn't like, was the Texas toast. Was dry, no butter or garlic salt on it. Looked like plain old loaf bread.

Will be back again."}
{"text":"This place is so good that I'm almost reluctant to write a review.  After all, I really don't want it to become too popular.  I grew up in eastern North Carolina and have been eating barbeque since I was a child.  I like to think of myself as a barbeque aficionado, but I doubt that I really am.  

This place just has great barbeque, and while it is not eastern NC style, it is the best around.  There is a good selection of menu items to include appetizers.  Everything I've tried is just great.  My usual meal is pulled pork with 2 sides and cornbread.  The pulled pork has some of the bark mixed in.  You can actually get a burnt ends meal.  The sides are good:  baked beans, collards, mac and cheese, okra, slaw, etc.  The sweet potato tots were recommended, but that just wasn't my thing.  I would suggest having hot vinegar sauce available for the collards, which they do not have at this time.  

Most meals have a small, medium, and large size option.  Even the small size is generous.  Table service is quick and friendly.  There is a smaller location in Concord where customers wait in line to get inside."}
{"text":"Best bbq in concord and surrounding area. Highly recommend the brisket and turkey. Come early on the weekends because this place is Rockin."}
{"text":"Had the Brisket sandwich with deviled egg potato salad.  Yummy!"}
{"text":"No frills atmosphere but Great food!  5 of us went.  All of us really liked the food.  We all had pulled pork - a sandwich, the pulled pork salad and the pulled pork plate. Smoky flavor, tender pork.  Variety of sauces - Eastern, Western, regular and hot - even an option for the South Carolina mustard sauce. Oh - and the peach cobbler was really good as well."}
{"text":"In the past, I praised this place while a few others critiqued it. Today, June 17, 2018 Father's Day at 5:30 p.m. we arrived to be greeted with a cardboard sign, NO PORK and NO TURKEY. We still went inside, the place had people at 2 tables only. I asked the server, HOW CAN YOU NOT HAVE PORK OR TURKEY AND ITS NOT EVEN DINNER TIME YET PLUS ITS FATHERS DAY? She said they were busy at lunch.......BULLSHIT. I ORDERED THE HALF CHICKEN PLATE with 2 SIDES AND TOAST FOR $11. When the plate came, the chicken could fit in the palm of my hand, THAT TOO IS BULLSHIT. The managers head should be fired for poor planning to order enough meat. They should be ashamed to charge $11 for suck a small portion."}
{"text":"My wife and I were able to collectively breath a sigh of relief when we made our first visit to The Smoke Pit after moving from Charlotte to Concord.  This was the result of determining that we didn't have to make the drive back to Charlotte for good BBQ.  At this point we have tried all of their meat variations and most of their sides and conclude that they serve up some delicious stuff.  Particularly noteworthy is their pulled pork or pulled chicken, fried okra (one of my wife's all-time favorites), and collard greens.  Their portion sizes are so large that we both share a meat and two sides (along with bread) and are both left satisfied.

The only drawbacks of note is their limited seating (due to their justified popularity) and awkward situated line to the register.  The door that leads to their outside seating is typically blocked by this line and their waiting area, for picking up food to go, is situated along the wall where the line is standing.  All in all not enough to pull this rating to 4 stars.

If you are anywhere around Concord (or passing along I-85), I highly recommend giving them a try."}
{"text":"Always good and always a large portion. If you decide to take out call ahead since they stay busy and packed. The chicken thighs are the best as well as the fried okra. Think I've tried a little bit of everything and haven't been disappointed yet."}
{"text":"Great BBQ, great big portions, great service. For a pretty busy restaurant, they keep the place nice and clean. 

The meat market next door is a bit pricey but very convenient for all your grilling needs."}
{"text":"Best I have ever eaten!!! Brisket is amazing and Burnt Ends are to die for!! You will never leave here hungry. Owners are great people!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. This restaurant has the best BBQ out of anywhere in the south. I'm constantly recommending everyone I know to come try it! Not only do they have the best southern food, they have awesome customer service with the nicest staff! 10/10 try it!"}
{"text":"This place is the BEST for BBQ.  It's a bit too popular though, so getting a table or placing an order to-go can take forever.  The best bet is to call the order in while you are waiting in the huge line.  Everything here is remarkable and worth the wait.  FYI-If you wait until evening to show up, they run out of many things."}
{"text":"So good! Only advice is to go during lunch or early afternoon because if they run out of a meat or side, that is all they have for the day."}
{"text":"I've tried BBQ all over the country, and The Smoke Pit delivered the best brisket I've ever had. Thick cut, juicy, smoky. Both my dad and I had to savor every bite. We left the ends for the last bites as the perfectly done outside was delectable. 

The BBQ beans were an incredible side as well. Bits of pork in it with just enough heat to remind you that it's a barbecue restaurant. 

The pulled pork and Mac N' Cheese were good too, but when next to the brisket, it doesn't even hold a torch. 

Do yourself a favor: Drive here. Order brisket and beans. Sleep. You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat in Concord by far. It's a little expensive for a lunch, but worth it to go every once and a while. The cornbread is delicious, I recommend it to everyone! The service is usually fast and friendly. It's a great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in town. Alittle on the expensive side but the amount of food you get makes up for the price."}
{"text":"We were shopping at the Carolina Mall in Concord. We did a yelp search on restaurants in that area and The Smoke Pit came up. We walked in the door and we were informed that they were closing (8PM is their closing time). The place did not look like much, but smelled wonderful.

We were in the area again today so we stopped in about 5PM. We were at the end of the line, barely inside door and waited about 30 minutes to get up to the cashier. The line outside at that point was pretty long and it was about 97 degrees outside. She told us we would have to wait a few minutes for a table to clear before we could order. The long wait is to make sure if you are eating in, you will get a table. We only waited about 5 more minutes, placed our order and went to the table. I went up to get our fountain drinks and when I came back our food was there. This place is well worth the wait. Pulled pork and brisket were fantastic. Good service and very casual. Side dishes were great too (best baked beans ever)! 

If you go for dinner, get there before 5PM on Saturday. The line outside was still pretty long when we left. Their website says they started on 2014 and would serve about 30 people a day. The now serve on average about 700 people a day!!\""}
{"text":"If I'm staying in Concord for BBQ there no question this is where we're going to get it from. Hands down one of the best in the area, if not the best. You can tell they use good quality meats and ingredients because that taste comes through with every bite. There is nothing on their menu that isn't fabulous. 7 out of 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"We went after Christmas and the food was excellent.  The portions are large enough and we took food home for the next day.  I am not a fan of leftovers but I ate my brisket the next day for lunch.  The brisket was very tender and bbq sauces they have add a nice touch to the meat.  I would highly recommend and I will definitely be back sooner than later."}
{"text":"I'll finally review a BBQ joint in North Carolina, because I've finally found one worth talking about and returning to!
If there were 1/2 stars available, I'd give it 4 1/2, but since I can't do 5 stars, 4 it is...

I got the 4 meat combo, figuring I would do a double order of ribs (erroneously assuming they only gave 2 bones with the combo), and try the brisket and hot links too. And I figured I'd have enough for dinner tomorrow too. 

Well, I have dinner for the next several nights. And upon ordering ribs, the woman informed me they had beef ribs tonight too. So I ordered beef ribs, St Louis ribs, brisket and hot links. I opted for cornbread over Texas toast, and I picked mac and cheese and deviled egg potato salad as my sides....

Beef Ribs - Absolutely fantastic. Nice smoke, very tender, nice char on the outside. 

St Louis Ribs - My only complaint is that they're overcooked. I like to be able to take a bite of a rib, have the meat come away cleanly, but leave a bite mark and have the rest of the meat stay on the bone. Well, these kind of started shredding as I tried to cut one bone off the 4 bone rack (they give you 4 bones as part of a combo order, not 2!). And then completely fell apart when I took my first bite. That said, though, they're delicious. 

Brisket - the hardest meat for me to get perfect when I'm doing the smoking myself...and very rarely do I run across good brisket outside of Texas and Kansas City. Let me tell you, this brisket delivers the goods. Nice bark, nice smoke ring, and so very tender but not falling apart. And as part of a 4 meat combo, an insanely large portion!

Hot Links - Very tasty. Maybe I'm just not used to my smoked sausage being done with such an obviously Italian style sausage, which threw me off a little. But very well seasoned, and good smoke flavor.

The mac and cheese was average. Not bad, but not worth talking about. The deviled egg potato salad, on the other hand, is worth going back for by itself! It's funny... I used to get annoyed when my mother in law used to put hard boiled eggs in her otherwise delicious potato salad. But I LOVE deviled eggs. And I didn't actually get a bite of egg itself in the potato salad. But it's tossed with the right amount of vinegar, mustard, etc. to have the taste of the yolks from deviled eggs, seemingly without the whites from the eggs polluting my potato salad. Sooooo very good! 
The cornbread, too, was very good. I only took one bite, since I got full quickly. 

I will certainly be back, to try out a few other things. If their brisket was this good, I'm reeeeaaally looking forward to trying their burnt ends. 

If you're in Concord, Huntersville, Kannapolis...or hell, take the ride from Charlotte, since I've not had any 'cue anywhere remotely in the area that's this good...get here. ASAP."}
{"text":"Best burnt ends ever, I don't post slot of reviews but this place deserves 5 stars. Great Bbq and great service."}
{"text":"I really want to give this place 3.5 stars, but I'll put it at 3 since I can't do that.

At any rate, we stopped by the Smoke Pit after a 5k run, so we were hungry.  We were in the area and saw that this had great reviews, plus we just love bbq.

When we arrived, the smell was wonderful and it took no time to get our order.  However, we ordered the 4 meat platter and only received 3.  They quickly fixed the mistake though.

We ordered the pork, brisket, sausage, and ribs along with the potato salad and mac and cheese.  All was good, but not great.  Hard to say great when there are better options out there.  The brisket was the worst, it was very dry.  We had leftovers and took the rest home, but the brisket was the only thing we did not finish.  

Overall, great quick fast service, with great portion sizes for the price, but there are better options out there that I would not be driving out of my way to Concord to go back to.  Midwood will still be our go to bbq place."}
{"text":"Great place to grab some good NC BBQ. They're very generous with their portions. Come here if you want to be full. Definitely worth a try. If you haven't been."}
{"text":"Wow!  Awesome food!  Everything was amazing!  Mac and cheese, baked beans and especially sweet potato casserole!!!"}
{"text":"Second time here in two days. 
First day I was easily fooled I into thinking I could eat. They proved me wrong!
Today I only ordered a sandwich, the stock market. I barely finished that!!
Come hungry, you will leave full and satisfied. 
Heading home to have a meat baby now!"}
{"text":"We went here because we had read many good reviews about this restaurant. And I have to say that I was rather disappointed, even though I knew that any restaurant in Monroe was going to score lower then those in other places. About the only thing this place has going for it is serving size. But having said that, a big pile of mediocre meat is still a big pile of mediocre meat.

Our server was very polite, but stretched a bit thin. She came to our table and asked us if we wanted another drink and we declined. Shortly she returned with a second round of drinks because she wasn't actually listening. But I don't blame that so much on her, as I do with them being short-staffed. She was very polite otherwise and I had no complaints on the service.

I would describe what I ate, but the only thing I can remember is that it was brisket, and it wasn't as good as any brisket I've had in the last few years. It wasn't terrible, but it was completely unmemorable. My partner felt the same about his pulled pork. They offer substantial sides, but again they are mediocre and our servings that are much larger than they need to be.

While I don't have any major complaints, I'm not sure that I would return here unless someone else suggested it. It's just one of those things where it wasn't a bad experience, just very forgettable."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere. We got the sampler to go (thank god because there was a HUGE LINE), and it did not disappoint. We have had BBQ all over the country and this ranked right up there in the top."}
{"text":"HOOOOOOOLLLLLLLLYYYYYYY COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW. If my memory serves me correct, this is the only time i DID NOT have to add any kind of sauce to my sandwich.  SPECTACULAR!!!!!!! I can not wait to go back!!!!  Wish they sold beer tho"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's as local as you get and the food is fantastic!

I'd give it 5 stars, but I'm here for pickup... I had to come in and order as their online order app \"orderspoon\" indicates that they are closed! If they could get this working, then 5 stars for sure!!

I am getting the brisket and my wife is getting the wings. They don't have just an order of wings, but the staff is so helpful in finagling a way to order the wings. The just need to add wings as an entrée rather than a side and they'd sell a million. The wings are fantastic, just like all their food!

But... This is a \"LOCAL\" place, so I guess I'll take the wings however they want me to have them!"}
{"text":"This was my second visit. The first was good... the second horrible. The line wait was long and people kept breaking in line, there wasn't anyone from the establishment to monitor. The place just isn't big enough and doesn't have sufficient seating for the crowds. We waited over an hour. People were saving tables and moving to better tables. They were asked not to do that several times. The service was slow one person in our party got their food, the other two sat and sat... someone actually came by to ask if everything was alright when it was obvious that two of us hadn't been served. We finally had to go find out about it... it wasn't waiting anywhere and wasn't even prepared... they acted like they didn't believe us... I had to provide my reciept to get our meals. The food was warm, my wet ribs were good, beans were good and the slaw was ok. The brisket was over 2/3 fat and I couldn't see it well enough to trim. I brought that home... I would have sent it back, but I didn't want to wait any longer. Management better wake up... it won't last forever at this rate. I paid $47 for two meals plus a nice tip - given before the poor service and food problems."}
{"text":"Went there last night for dinner.  Had good food, reasonable priced.  Reminded me of good Ole country place.  Will definitely try again"}
{"text":"Really good place! 

 Food was great. I have recommended several people to go.

Great service. Food delivered fast and hot"}
{"text":"This was some fantastic BBQ! I am picky with my brisket, and everything about this one was perfect. Had the pulled pork as well--some of the best I have had in a long time. My wife and I split the combo platter because I heard how huge the portions were. Absolutely the ticket--perfect amount for both of us! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is pretty great BBQ joint. Busy all the time and people are real nice. I would recommend this restaurant to people who either want good BBQ or want to learn anything about BBQ , Yankee this includes me as well. But maybe I am a damn yankee because I will never live back up north, now that I know what BBQ is like"}
{"text":"This is one of the best places to get Barbecue!! The portions are very large. You can feed 2 kids per one plate! I definitely loved the banana pudding and peach cobbler they made in mason jars! Excellent choices and excellent tasting food. Best by far. You can certainly mess up desserts, I don't like everyone's banana pudding. But they have the best! Hands down. Great place to enjoy yourself!"}
{"text":"I have been desperately seeking quality BBQ since I moved to Charlotte 8 years ago. This spot is easily the best and most authentic smoked bbq I have had in the Carolinas. The ribs are meaty with true hickory smoke flavor. The smoked wings have the best texture of any I have ever had. The sides are delicious as well, especially the sweet potato casserole.  The collard greens have a great kick to them. It was too much for my girlfriend but perfect for me. The deviled egg potato salad is perfect. The french fries are delicious. The chicken leg quarters had a delicious white bbq sauce that i will never forget. The service was excellent from the ladies at the counter that took our order to the gentleman that was tending the tables. His name is Tucker I believe. He answered every question I had about all the food, (I had plenty). Truly a great experience. Worth the drive I took up from Charlotte. One of the best meals I have ever had."}
{"text":"The Smoke Pit offers authenticity for a reasonable price.  Their entrees are generous and flavorful.  You will like this BBQ and Brisket Concord favorite."}
{"text":"Been here quiet a few times with friends and family. Love the deviled egg potato salad! My mom gets something different every time and has never been disappointed.
The pulled pork plate is my favorite, paired with fried okra and deviled egg potato salad. The pickles and onion is an added treat. Finish is up with their peach cobbler! YUM!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing told my boyfriend I didn't like burnt food. So he bought home burnt ends.... omg Heaven.  I instantly fell in love.  No really burnt, learned something new .  The mac n cheese was good as mine and the chicken... needless to say I liked it.  Greens were too spicy, but the flavor was awesome too."}
{"text":"Oh wow this place has really good food....really really good food. We got 4 kinds with our order-brisket, ribs, pulled pork, and the smoked chicken thighs. All of it was drool worthy and the portion sizes are huge.

Can't wait to go here again!"}
{"text":"Good prices and a lot of food for what you pay. The side items were amazing; fries, beans, mac & cheese. I had brisket and my boyfriend had pulled pork. The meat came out on a tray, would have preferred a plate, and it was sitting in a puddle of grease. The brisket was more fat than actual meat. Everything was good except the meat for me. Just too greasy and fatty. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Really good BBQ in NC. Had brisket and ribs. The ribs were absolutely delicious. They were tender and had lots of good flavor. These were in the top 5 ribs I've had anywhere. The brisket was really good too, probably top 4 I've had anywhere. It was tender with good flavor too. The sides were solid. Mac n Cheese was on point and the okra was a dark golden brown which I really enjoyed. Nice work!!! I'm so happy to have this place close by so I don't have to leave NC for good BBQ that's not chopped pork, which I love too!!"}
{"text":"Very good barbecue. Stopped here because of reviews and their Texas brisket is so good! The servers are also very responsive and make sure you are served well. We had three different servers stop by our table to make sure all is well. Satisfied!"}
{"text":"Love the bbq pulled pork and sweet potatoes. We spend roughly $80 for a family of 4 when we visit.
The stock market has the best prices for their quality of meat as well I would drive from south Charlotte just to stock up"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Huge portions. Good service. I had the BBQ Combo with St. Louis style ribs and brisket. It comes with two meats and two sides, although mine showed up with the beans and sweet potato fries I ordered, plus Cole slaw.

The meat on the ribs and brisket had an awesome crust, like burnt ends. Whatever they use in the dry rub is delicious! The meat all tasted great without sauce and the two sauces (they have 3 on the table) I tried were delicious. I didn't try the third because I could tell from the consistency of it that it was a vinegary sauce, which is not my favorite. One of the sauces I had was slightly sweet and spicy and the other was mostly just sweet. 

The sides I had were BBQ baked beans and sweet potato fries. The beans were clearly scratch made and had some tiny pieces of green onion in them as well as some kind of pulled meat, pork I think. Both sides were delicious. The beans were really rich and the sweet potato fries were waffle cut and had sugar on them, so they were almost like dessert. The meal also came with corn bread, which was slightly sweet and totally delicious. The cole slaw was more vinegary than sweet and I prefer sweet, but it was good.

My mom had the Pork Super Spud, which is one of their two loaded baked 
potato options. Loaded is an understatement. It is the biggest loaded baked potato I've ever seen. I did taste it and it was delicious. It also came with a side, so my mom got the salad, which she loved.

The food came quickly and the servers were very attentive. At this place you place your order at the counter and they give you a number, then a server brings your food to your table. From bringing our food, checking on us periodically to bringing the take out boxes and containers to the sauce home the server did a good job.

I will definitely go back here.

Oh, I forgot to mention that the restaurant is attached to a butcher shop. I didn't get a chance to peruse the meats there because it was closed by the time we finished our dinner, but I went there years ago when they first opened and I do remember the meats looking like amazing quality. The restaurant meat reflects that for sure."}
{"text":"Let's get the good part out of the way first. The ribs are ah-may-zing! As for the rest....meh. The service is abysmal, the brisket was dry and the service...oh wait, I already said that. No really folks, the waitress brought our food then disappeared. We ended up having to flag her down after waiting 30 minutes for help! And what's with tipping BEFORE you get served? I wanted my tip back sooooo bad! Also, all of us had sore tummies for hours after our meal. I don't think it was bad food but the portions are so ginormous it encourages overeating. Just what our corpulent society needs. Another restaurant over feeding its patrons. Yeah, I'll never go back."}
{"text":"Hands down the best BBQ I've had. The ribs are incredible and all of the sides were just as good. Try the baked beans!!!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place for bbq. My husband and I ordered 2 platters and brought home enough leftovers for at least another meal for each of us. We had brisket, burnt ends, fries, coleslaw, mac'n cheese, and sweet potato fries. Everything was amazing. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with some friends from work and it was packed. We contemplated leaving out of fear of not getting a table, but I am glad we didn't! The staff was very helpful in getting the six of us seared together. I had the ribs and chicken wings with mac & cheese and beans and it was great!! The wings are phenomenal!! A must try,"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Charlotte!!!!  Absolutely no doubt!  Chopped brisket and sweet sauce is the way to go.  Burnt ends dominate all."}
{"text":"I don't normally like BBQ but I LOVE The Smoke Pit. From the BBQ to the chicken to the tea and to the dessert. It's one of our favorite places to eat!"}
{"text":"I had the brisket sandwich and it was good.  There was ALOT of fat that I had to pull away from it, but they give you so much, there's plenty of meat left.  I got the  Deviled Egg Potato Salad and it was really yummy.  I've never had this anywhere before, but I love Deviled eggs, so it was exactly what I expected.  I went for lunch during the week and we were able to order and sit right down, but I hear that on the weekends, it nuts.  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I got the Texas brisket plate with cornbread, collard greens and coleslaw. The service was excellent and I sat out on the patio so the atmosphere was great! The only thing that wasn't absolutely amazing about the food was that my brisket was mostly fat. Will definitely try back again."}
{"text":"Went for the first time today based on a recommendation from a friend, and the place didn't disappoint.  I had the beef brisket and the pulled pork; both were excellent, especially the brisket - moist, juicy, full of smokey flavor and covered in the most incredible BBQ bark I've ever seen.  Good corn bread and sides too.  And the quantity was more than I could eat at one sitting; very good value for the money.  I saw some reviews about long lines and crowded tables, and I can believe it because the place is small, but we didn't have a problem finding a table today.  Besides, what better recommendation is there than a lot of people wanting to eat at a place that's been there for a couple of years."}
{"text":"Stopped in Veterans Day weekend. Doing a land office business,  You won't walk away hungry. But I had a problem with the two smoked chicken quarters. First one was pink at the bone but since it was appearing to be at the proper temperature I consumed it. Second one had blood pooling upon cutting into it. Floor manager tried to tell me it was fine! After some discussion she credited me $3 since I told her I had eaten the first one despite it being pink. The pulled pork was excellent. Just be aware, if they are slammed they might rush the food before it's ready to be served."}
{"text":"I love the BBQ here. It's just the sides are usually cold by the time you get them.
But the BBQ is some of the best in town!"}
{"text":"We love bbq and trying bbq places we haven't been to before. This was our first visit after hearing rave comments from friends. Three of us in our party and this is what we ordered: 1 bbq sandwich w/ french fries, 1 small bbq plate w/ french fries and 1 order chicken wings, 1 sweet tea, 1 watermelon sweet tea and a soft drink.  Will give you a breakdown of pros and cons. 
Pro:
1) they have great ice ( I'm a part time ice critic)
2) the bbq is extremely tender 
3) we got no fat in our portions (for us that's terrific)
3) chicken wings were good and done and delicious. 
4) french fries are thick and tasty.
5) sweet tea was sweet but not near as sweet as we prefer. 
6) service was very quick
7) portions were generous 
Cons:
1) not enough seating AND tables are so close together
2) sweet tea isn't sweet enough for us
3) watermelon sweet tea was ok. 
4) the bun for the sandwich was not very soft or tasty
5) we couldn't find a sauce (out of 5) that we truly liked. 
6) we felt rushed to leave because others needed our table AND we had 2 employees ask us at the same exact time to take our trays after we were done (it's not like they couldn't see each other ).
7) bbq was a little on the dry side to me.
So all in all, a good solid 4!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Brisket!!  The pulled pork was also extremely good, and their cherry cobbler was delicious!!  I stopped here because it was close and I was hungry, but I will be back because it was amazing food, huge portions, and at a very reasonable price.  Don't miss this one!!!!"}
{"text":"I love to eat here as well as their other locations. I had them even cater my wedding. They were on time and food was great like always."}
{"text":"Delicious, properly prepared tender BBQ. Large portions, enough to share, or to bring home for the next day at a fair price."}
{"text":"Awesome BBQ. Just a small hometown feel. Nothing fancy inside but delectable BBQ. Big portions and very friendly staff."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had in years.  My husband and I drove up from Charlotte and are so glad we did.  We split a 2-meat plate (pulled pork and wings with dragon sauce). BEST WINGS I HAVE EVER HAD, and we didn't even go to the restaurant for those!  Mac and cheese was good, not amazing but good.  Baked beans and sweet potato casserole were INSANE.  Had leftover pork the next day, and even in the microwave, it was STILL just as moist.  Couldn't recommend this place more.  Ohh, and our meal was $27 WITH tip! Score!"}
{"text":"BBQ is solid. Good smoke. My wife thought the brisket dry; I thought it tasty and crumbly. Pretty good sauce; nice rough cut on slaw (not made there).   An improvement in concord BBQ."}
{"text":"Get there early or be prepared to wait or have them run out. Crowded, busy, AWESOME food that will leave you full but yearning to return. Good staff, hard working and friendly. If you don't have a good meal, You will be in the vast, vast minority. Beans are spicy, brisket is tender/tasty, ribs are heaven. GET SOME SMOKE PIT!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding BBQ. Might be the best I've ever had. Serving are HUGE!!! I had the pulled pork sandwich and had enough pork on the sandwich to make a whole 2nd sandwich. I got the fried okra which was also outstanding. My husband got the Stock Market sandwich and it was absolutely massive! He got the fries as his side and ordered some cornbread. He raved about all of it! My kids split a mac n cheese pint which was plenty for them. That was great too! Really, we loved our meal and were thoroughly impressed. Great customer service too! The waiters were very attentive and friendly. We also ordered a mason jar banana pudding and it was outstanding - not too sweet and perfect combo of bananas, cream and pudding. Yum!!! Thanks again!"}
{"text":"I have sat down or took food from many times and each time I would have given them 4 stars, but on 8/26 2016 the take out was horrible! When I got home of the 8 bones of ribs, 4 bones were inedible, they were hard and burned! The brisket was dry and salty! I pray this is a one time happening!
Next time I will check my order before I leave, something just a few months ago was unthinkable!"}
{"text":"OMG YUM!!!
Each and every time we hit this very popular spot, EVERYTHING is sooooo good. 
Whether you are in the mood for a rack of ribs, brisket or a pulled pork sandwich, you won't be disappointed!
Did I say YUM!!??"}
{"text":"Amazing food (get the small portion- way too much!) a ton of variety, cool local craft beers and great atmosphere! Our waitress was the best!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It was the first place we went when we moved to NC. Best bbq around! And you get so much food! The potato salad is the best! My only complaint would be, one time we went in and the girl at the counter was pretty rude. By far our favorite place so far!"}
{"text":"The best brisket I have ever had! Make sure you try the burnt ends, greens and sweet potato casserole. 
Can't go wrong with this spot unless you wait too long and they sell out!"}
{"text":"Update:  I think they grew too quickly?? ...We have been back several times and each time the brisket comes out dry.  Makes me sad!"}
{"text":"Every thing was delicious !!! You definitely get what you pay for here with the big portions and sides, service is great too for how busy they are."}
{"text":"This review is for their smoked whole turkey and mashed potatoes that ordered to be picked up on the Thanksgiving Day. This review is not for their daily bbq.

The turkey was packed very nicely, with a nice pan and covered by several layers of foil and plastic wrap to keep the moist in. However, the bird itself is flavorless, dry and simply the worst turkey I have ever tried. Only 1 out of 7 guests liked it in our thanksgiving party. When I ordered it, I was told by the cashier that it was the best turkey she had ever had. She was simply lying to me or she was so unlucky that hadn't had any good turkey in her life. I would definitely not order the turkey from them anymore. By the way, their turkey is about $70. A nicely packed, expensive, dry and plain bird.

And, I ordered a half size pan of mashed potatoes from them, which cost me $25+. And it did not come with gravy, and is not tasty at all. But it was better than the bird.

I also ordered another turkey and a half size pan mashed potatoes from Bojangles ($9.99!). I was not expecting this but the mashed potatoes from Bojangles was way much better than the SmokePit. The Bojangles turkey was slightly better, not dry at all with a little flavor, and priced at $39.99. I probably would not order from them in the future as well but they are a much fairer choice.

As a conclusion, let me mention that the pickup service at the SmokePit was truly great. The only thing made me upset was their food."}
{"text":"JuJu did an amazing job catering my little sisters baby shower. Food was on point!!! Definitely using The Smoke Pit for future events."}
{"text":"This place has had the best smoked food and brisket. I live in Petersburg Va and can't wait to travel back that way to get some more delicious food. I'm actually planning a trip back to nc, especially for The Smoke Pit food. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is, the wait for my food was kinda long. I went two days back to back and the line was long every time. Especially when the other side, which is their meat grocery store , was closed."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal and lives up to all the hype. The restaurant shares a building with a meat market, owned by the same guys. Be sure to check out both. We went at around 6 p.m. on a Friday night and it was a long line to order. They make a big deal about not sitting down at a table until after you've ordered. Since the entire family is waiting in line, it looks longer than it actually is.

While in line we noticed people proceeding directly to the counter to pick up their carry out, which was a very smart thing to do when it's busy. If you go that route, enter the building through the door on the far left marked exit and proceed directly to the counter.

We took the advice of others and my wife and I split the choose any four tray. It was great to be able to try all of the different meats, but was entirely too much food for two people. Next time we will order this for my family of five and supplement with a couple extra sides.

The best meat on our tray was the pulled pork. We come from Eastern Carolina and are very picky, but this was excellent stuff. The sausage and chicken wings were also very good and you get a great quantity. Will have to give the brisket another try next time. It was definitely on the dry side, but had good smoky flavor. Obviously they don't pull it straight out of the smoker and put it on your plate, so somehow it was dried out in the process of reheating.

The best side we had was the sweet potato casserole. The BBQ beans were also very good. The mac and cheese was nothing to write home about.

In summary this place was really good. Be aware that you might need to wait a while if you go when they're busy. The pulled pork and sweet potato casserole are awesome. The food itself reminded me a lot of Mac's speed shop in Southend. Give it a try.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love the smoked wings here - the Alabama White sauce totally rocks!!!!  The salad was fresh and delightful, the brisket was moist and flavorful.  Our favorite BBQ place.  I did find the collards a bit salty, but love love love the wings!!!"}
{"text":"The pulled chicken and the ribs were very good,  but the beef brisket was on a whole different level. Best I've ever had. Their side dishes that I tried were also very good,  especially the BBQ beans.  My only complaint was that the cornbread was dry,  and it may have been because we got our order to go.  Can't wait to get some more of that amazing beef brisket!"}
{"text":"Follow up: Downrated for the frequency that they run out of food. They have been open long enough to anticipate volume better that they are. You're pretty much rolling the dice if you go on if they will be crazy busy, or just out of food. Seems to be worse on Saturdays. Today they ran out of food before they even reached dinner hours. Locked the door but didn't bother to put a sign up or turn off their open sign."}
{"text":"This place is gross. I have friends who work here. The mean is cooked between 5-10am so it sits in a warmer all day. It's sitting in grease for hours. And even until the next day as well, they tell you the left over food gets taken to the homeless shelter at the end of the night, they're luring to make the place look good."}
{"text":"WOW!!!!!! The service was great and the food was delicious. Had the brisket, pulled pork and the wings. The wings with dragon sauce were the best. If I could give it a 6 star I would. This is now my #1 BBQ place"}
{"text":"We tried it for the first time at lunch on a Thursday and had to come back the next night for dinner.  The wait at lunch wasn't long, but the wait Friday night was soo long, BUT totally worth it!  Best BBQ we've had in NC!  Our favorites are the pulled pork baked potato, the sweet potato casserole, the brisket, and the fried okra.  I've never like fried okra until I tasted theirs and it was delicious!  HIGHLY recommend this place - the food is awesome!"}
{"text":"Really really great BBQ. The smoked sausage was the best I've ever had and dipped in the sweet spicy sauce (Dragon Sauce?) took it to another level. The service was so good, too! Sweet tea was grand and parking was decent. Only complaint (and it's minor) was that we were there close to closing time so my cornbread and Mac and cheese were bottom of the barrel. They were still good; just not as good as what I saw when I was in line an hour or so earlier. All in all, a good experience and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Our group of 4 ordered all sorts of entrees and shared. Every single thing was awesome.  Best cornbread on the planet. Whopping size of portions.  First visit and I plan to return soon!"}
{"text":"The best pulled chicken BBQ and beef brisket I've ever had !  The line to the place is long and rightfully so .... the food was delicious! The slaw was fabulous! This is my new go to place for BBQ ! Don't miss this one !"}
{"text":"Best bbq and service I have had in awhile portions are huge everything fresh and hot spread the word"}
{"text":"This is It! The real thing. If your version of the real thing is smokey, barky, craft BBQ . Delicious, unpretentious. Had burnt ends (very tasty and well sauced) and Brisket. Great flavor. Also Mac and Cheese and butteryTexas Toast we great. You do get a lot of food too."}
{"text":"The wings were my favorite. The pulled pork and ribs were great too. Burnt ends were a little tough which is why they get 4 stars instead of 5. The 3 meat platter was enough food for 2 or 3 people. Baked beans, Mac & Cheese, and the collards were all tasty too. Will be back next time in Charlotte. Line was out the door, but it was worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"They did an absolutely fantastic job catering my niece's wedding!!!  Best food and superior service at the wedding. I cannot recommend their catering highly enough!!!"}
{"text":"This is some of the best bbq that I have ever eaten and that is quite a statement. There was a small line when we got there but it moved quickly and gave us a chance to review the extensive menu and check out the trays as they were delivered to the tables. Between the three of us we had the brisket, pulled pork, sausage and pulled chicken....hey the first three were together on my sandwich! Everything was great-meats, sauces, sides...crazy good. 

The crowds continued to stream in even as it started raining. The locals must know the secret about getting their takeout because it was handled at a different window (thank you) and continuous. It was really almost the ultimate BBQ experience so much that I hate to mention that the sweet tea was only B+ and there was no banana pudding...a sin in SC but maybe not so much in NC.

Truly great food, nice folks working there and we will be back."}
{"text":"Many accolades bestowed on this place, having enjoyed some of the best BBQ in Texas and throughout the South I can only say AMEN to the positive reviews here. Never had a bad meal and tried nearly everything on the menu.  Brisket is solid, great smoke and very tender, I prefer my brisket cut from the point and they deliver.  Pork unlike most places around town is pulled not chopped, moist and delish! Sides are on point as well.

{"text":"This used to be my favorite place for BBQ but the meat has gotten full of more and more fat to the point where I now would recommend going elsewhere. In addition, the side of sweet potato fries have becoming smaller and smaller, to the point where I only received 6 fries this last time. The few times I do go, I get myself extra sauce from their table up front. However, the BBQ sauces are not labeled, so I have to go through every one trying to find the sauce I'm looking for, which often means a burning mouth from accidentally grabbing the hot sauce BBQ when I just want the sweet sauce. I ask them if they could label the bottles every time I come to make the process faster and easier for myself and other customers, but was just informed at my last trip that the current manager finds this to be a waste of time. If something that takes as little time as labeling bottles for customer convenience is considered a waste of time by the manager, then I'm afraid that explains why the quality of my once-favorite restaurant has been diminishing over time."}
{"text":"When we arrived at 2:30 there was a line out the door. Always a good sign and good food is worth the wait...

Once we finally ordered the cashiers we was very nice. He would not let us order until a table opened up because he wanted to make sure we got our food hot and were able to enjoy it. That is essentially what slows the line down. 

The menu is pretty standard for a bbq place however you can order just burn ends which I thought was pretty cool. I got that.  My wife got the large pulled pork plate with two sides, which was more than enough for two meals for her. 

My burn ends were a little dry but had good flavor. They can pre-sauced and hindsight I would have asked to ad my own. They were served on Texas toast with grilled onions. I enjoyed that. My side was the sweet potato casserole as recommended from the cashier. It did not disappoint. Soooo good. 

The pulled pork was good. She did not like the beans as they had some peppers in them or atleast that flavor. I tasted them and enjoyed them. Her fries were good. Seasoned well. 

All in all we will return. The ribs and brisket looked fantastic. I will try one of those next time."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in Cabarrus! You better order early because they get so busy they run out of food! Totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Food is great . We have been looking for a bbq spot for a while since my husband and I moved here and this is by far the best place in the Charlotte/concord area. By the time we eat you will have to roll us out. We are always stuffed and I always have to take the rest home. Wish the prices were a little cheaper but I'll pay for quality!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome - best brisket I've ever eaten, hands down. All the food is excellent including the sides."}
{"text":"The best Bar B Que in town!  Bikes beans, MAC and cheese, pulled pork, brisket, corn bread, and Texas toast.  Oh, don't forg t their watermelon iced tea!  Ymmmm"}
{"text":"This is one of the best barbeque restaurants I've ever been to. Considering I've lived in North Carolina for over 20 years I know good southern BBQ and this place tops it. From SC mustard, Alabama chicken BBQ, Memphis Ribs, NC pulled pork and delicious traditional Texas style brisket they have it all and do it all right. They have will never disappoint. They are definitely worth it so check it out."}
{"text":"Best BBQ I have had around here and I have lived in the area my whole life!! The portions were huge and the Mac and Cheese was amazing! I will definitely be going again and will recommend them to all of my friends and family!"}
{"text":"Good BBQ. Brisket was okay. The sides were okay. Nothing really stood out. I had the brisket sandwich. The flavor was good. The staff is friendly and the establishment is clean. I'd come back if in the area."}
{"text":"Christen at the Smoke Pit  helped me plan a birthday party for my husband and his military friends. She recommended we serve the brisket, chicken and pulled pork.  Christen's customer service was top notch, the food was excellent and the guys enjoyed themselves. We will definitely use the Smoke Pit again.

{"text":"Very good and the portions are huge. The prices are pretty high but you definitely get your monies worth. I would love to see them cut the portions in half and charge half the price. There is no way I can eat all of that food. The food is very flavorful and tender. The Mac and cheese, greens, and cornbread are amazing! They are always busy and running out of things so I try to call ahead."}
{"text":"Great atmospher, great food, great customer service! Finger lickin' good! Will be back!"}
{"text":"I used to go to this place all the times but the last two times I been the food as not been the same..down right horrible made my stomach upset..they must be under new ownership so BEWARE"}
{"text":"Great spot!  BBQ is on point, and the staff is super friendly. The burnt ends were done perfectly, and the okra was awesome too."}
{"text":"R got the pulled chicken sandwich and said it was excellent. D & E got the two meat platter of brisket and pulled chicken.  their chicken had the sauce already on it and it was D licious.  I got the plain pulled chicken dry with no sauce on it. That really allows you to taste the chicken and the true genuine smoky flavor. Of course we got cobbler afterwards we got one apple and one strawberry. With ice cream of course. The cobbler is worth it when you leave you're moaning because your belly is so full but it is worth it.  Go early!"}
{"text":"My daughter and her husband took me here for the first time now I can't wait to take my husband. The service was great. The food is awesome! And the portions they bring out on that big tray are crazy. So it may seem a little expensive but they sure give you plenty of food. My daughter got the loaded brisket potato and I promise you I've never seen a potato that big in all my life!! And I personally recommend the collards. They are full of pulled pork and have just a touch of heat. Everything was very, very good."}
{"text":"Hubby and I shared meals. I had the brisket (moist juicy goodness) and ribs (falls right of the bone bbq pig heaven) , he had the pulled pork and sausage. A-freakin-mazing! We wanted to try the wings too so we got a four piece and boy was I glad we did! The Mac and cheese is so good it tastes like something I would make, and the baked beans were so sweet and smoky. I wanted real southern BBQ and I got everything I could ask for at Smoke Pit."}
{"text":"Brisket and burnt ends are the real deal. Portions sizes are extra large 2 meat plate is big enough to serve 3 people. Setup and layout is typical for BBQ joint. Servers were attentive and friendly.  Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this place and will visit whenever I want authentic Texas style brisket."}
{"text":"My first time here, but it will not be my last. The food was great. And if you go on the day that they have strawberry cobbler, you have got to try it. It is delicious. The prices are a little high, but you sure do get your money's worth."}
{"text":"Hubby and I recently relocated here from FL so every time we drove by The Smoke Pit we saw how crowded it was. Well, yesterday we stopped in and after I read all the reviews we decided to try the 4 Combo. We got the brisket, pulled pork, ribs, wings, cold slaw, Mac&Cheese and corn bread. OMGosh! The most delicious BBQ food I've ever had! They were all delicious but the pulled pork with their special BBQ sauces was out of this world!! Best part, we had enough food for next day too. Lol WE WILL DEFINITELY BE BACK!"}
{"text":"Ahhhmazing food, take out is kinda slow but oh man then food is great! I never knew this place was here until someone mentioned it. I thought it was only a store."}
{"text":"Delicious lots of great food. Burn end, brisket, pulled pork, sausage amazing. The sweet potatoes casserole was amazing. The French fries where fresh with and well seasoned."}
{"text":"BEST BBQ ST. LOUIS RIB STYLE IN THE CAROLINAS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Corn bread, brisket, sweet bbq sauce is amazing!!!! It is worth the drive. If you order the pick two, the portions are enough for two!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You will not regret it. I've been searching for 11 years for a smoking bbq joint and this place is legit."}
{"text":"Great food, nice clean place.  Would definitely go back.  My husband had the burnt ends of brisket plate and loved it.  I had the pulled chicken sandwich it was awesome. My sister-in-law had a salad with pulled pork, it was big and she loved it.  My brother-in-law had the ribs and said they were excellent. The cornbread is the best I have eaten in NC.  The sides were all plentiful."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food here. I had the 3 meat combo and while the ribs were not the best I have ever had they were quite tasty. The same can not be said for the pulled pork or the beef brisket however! The pulled pork may have been the best I have ever had, if not its close and the brisket was absolutely amazing. Best I have ever had bar none. Also had the mac and cheese and potato salad. They were both quite tasty as as well.The 3 meat como cost me around $24 which is a good bit for one meal IMO but with the quantity of food they provide I had 3 meals( and it reheats well to boot)  and close to a 4th so the value for the dollar was definitly there. I give the smoke pit two thumbs up! I will be visiting quite often"}
{"text":"Kyleigh is an amazing server she provided exceptional service to our large party. If she leaves we will never return to the establishment we are her regulars and appreciate the service she provides. Food was also good. Our margarita was amazing too. However coming from a restaurant manager the service is what makes or break a restuarant. Thanks kyleigh for the exceptional service."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch around 2:30 on a Saturday and the line was out the door! You order at a counter and they bring your food to you.  I had the BBQ salad and was only able to eat 1/3 of it, portions were huge!  I was starving but when faced with such a huge salad my stomach about shut down like noooo I can't eat all this.  It was elegantly played on a long rectangular plate and the leftovers when I put them in the to go box were overflowing. So much look and corn and bacon and yum. Husband  had the burnt ends sandwich and the ends were soooo tender, he offered me one and I tried to pluck it off his fork bit it started to fall apart.  Phenomenal.  The Mac and cheese was stirred with flavor not just cheese sauce.  Pickled onions were tangy, ribs were very tasty but not a lot of meat on them.  White slaw was good. Nice clean fresh friendly service and restaurant."}
{"text":"I heard a lot about this place and since I live in Concord, finally decided to try it out.  I went for take out and got two of the combo plates, one with my choice of two proteins and the other with my choice of three.  First the amount of food was incredible.  They are not cheap!!  Secondly, the food was awesome, everything from the BBQ pulled pork, Brisket, Ribs, and Chicken (yes I tried it all).  In addition, I had the sweet potato fries, Cole Slaw, greens and mac & cheese.  I tried to call ahead and couldn't get through so just drove down.  The line was to the door but I have to say the food was well worth the wait.  Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Was greeted tonight not by a hello or welcome, but \"First off, we ain't got no ice, no ribs, and no slaw\".  Really?   For a BBQ restaurant on a Saturday night, this is completely unacceptable.  This is like going to Chic-fil-a and being told they are out of chicken.  Get it together people!"}
{"text":"Went here for the 1st time and they had the best barbecue our waitress Meagan was amazing and very punctual on time made sure we had tea always in our cup. The atmosphere was very relaxed. I would highly recommended that you get the brisket spud. This is something you've never seen before. 
Will definitely be back to the smoke pit and very friendly waitress Meagan who is also very knowledgeable about the sauces. 
Best addition to Monroe area."}
{"text":"One word to describe this place? BUSY, like 'line out the door' or 'hope the Fire Marshall doesn't stop by' busy. If you're planning a trip to The Smoke Pit either get there as soon as they open the door or expect a substantial wait.

Seating is always a bit of a slight issue. You stand in line for the counter and then you get a table. The problem is a lot of parties will have someone go into the dining area and poach a seat before their order is placed. This messes up the cycle, when you're as busy as this place is every table counts.

If it's you're first time here I suggest the super spud. It's a giant loaded baked potato with cheese, scallions, bacon, sour cream and topped with your choice of pulled pork or brisket. You also get either a side salad or a side of your choice. The reason I like the super spud is because with the amount of BBQ they produce, sometimes they get a bit of a dry batch (more often the brisket then the pork) and all of the toppings on the spud help 'mask' a slight dryness, without masking the delicious flavor. You're mileage may vary.

Their homemade desserts are served in Mason jars and are huge! Wish I could get them more often but the portions of your meal will have you stuffed, usually with enough leftover for lunch tomorrow!

While you're there be sure to stop by The Stock Market, full service butcher shop. It's owned by the same guys and has great deals on quality meat!"}
{"text":"Come hungry because the portions are huge. Everything was delicious. We had ribs, brisket, sausage and sides. Yummm. Great spot."}
{"text":"Best BBQ Ribs in Charlotte!   St. Louis style, and wow are they good!  I can't wait to come back again.  

The jumbo wings were amazing too (and I'm not normally crazy about wings).  

The brisket was disappointing compared to the rest (rather dry), the sweet potato fries and the mac & cheese came out COLD (room temperature).  But the rest was so good, they keep 5 stars.  

They closed just after 6pm on a Wednesday night because they sold out.  So arrive early (4-5pm)

I'm so happy they opened in Concord!   This is my new spot =)"}
{"text":"I love this place. I used to live in Mooresville and I would make that 35 minute drive 1 way for this food at least twice a month. They have the best brisket I have ever had in my life. It's tender and delicious. The dry rub ribs hit the spot every time. And don't get me started on the dragon sauce flavored smoke wings. Bonus... the sides are really good too. That sweet potato casserole and the fried okras are things dreams are made of. Prices have recently went up but it's still worth it to me."}
{"text":"Burnt ends sandwich was the absolute best food that has ever hit my lips! When my friends visit from Salt Lake City, I will definitely be driving back down from Greensboro to bring them here no question!"}
{"text":"Definitely recommend going here for lunch, as the food quality in the evening just isn't the same. The brisket and ribs that are pretty moist and delicious at lunchtime are always tough and dry when I've had them for dinner. None of the sides I've tried here are anything special.  Decent enough bbq for the area but below average by Texas or  Memphis standards."}
{"text":"I was craving BBQ and decided to order takeout on a rainy Saturday. I ordered online. It was confusing because the app said there was a drive up window. The place was packed! I walked up to the counter and my order  was waiting! I had the pulled pork and the brisket with Mac and cheese and collards. It was all AWESOME! Enough for 2 meals. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best so far.  The sides are fantastic.  Always need a box to take what I can't eat home.  A must visit for guests and friends."}
{"text":"I eat a lot more than I review, but this place deserves a pause for the cause: come and eat! I drove out of my way to return for the burnt ends and made sure to complement the chef. In the NC Lexington vs Eastern debate, a lot of great BBQ gets passed over and few places do brisket well. These guys hit on all points, from the cook to the sauce to serving it with great onions. I'm confident there's a lot of other great options, I just haven't strayed from the burnt ends yet!!!

Also, go next door for great deals on bone-in shoulders (Boston Butt) and for the whole brisket, (cap and flat) which cooks way better than the flats they sell in most supermarkets."}
{"text":"This is the second time that my husband and have left without ordering food. We stood in line for over 30 minutes and then the people taking orders simply stopped. They claimed they were losing,numbers.. I have no idea what that even means. We decided along with about 6 other couples to just leave. That is a lot of money they are losing simply for bad time management.
 We had their food a few times at Cabarrus Brewery and it was pretty good. We actually went in and ordered food once but then waited almost an hour. The last two times we just left. It is unfortunate because the food itself is really good but they really need to learn time and customer management."}
{"text":"Ate here tonight with my son. Had ribs, pulled pork and brisket. Was enough food to serve a family of 4. I had dry ribs and they were cooked perfectly. The pulled pork was tender and not dry. The brisket was okay but the pieces I had must have had all the fat on them. My son's brisket maybe had 1/10 of the fat that I had on mine. Service was prompt and friendly. Would ear here again when I return to Charlotte.

Updated: for whatever reason my son was very sick later the night after eating dinner with me. He had mac-n-cheese which is the only difference. Not sure why he was sick but the question of why makes this a 3 instead of 4."}
{"text":"Visit date 8/5/2017 around 7:15 PM

THE FOOD: 
My husband been having a taste for some BBQ and was told about this place.  They sold out of pulled pork and brisket while I was standing in line, so he had to change his order. He then ordered ribs and chicken with fried okra and mac&cheese. My husband said his food was alright, the ribs was not tender but they had good flavor and the chicken was pretty good. I ordered the 3 side for $7.00 I had fried okra, sweet potato soufflé and mac&cheese. The Mac&cheese was REALLY GOOD, see I'm picky with my Mac & cheese I like home style Mac & Cheese, they made it JUST THE WAY I LIKE!! The soufflé was great also and the Cornbread was good (even had corn in it). 
PLEASE NOTE: GO BEFORE 7PM TO MAKE SURE THEIR NOT OUT OF NOTHING. 
So now he have to go back to taste the BBQ that's what he wanted and the only reason I went there for him. 

THE RESTAURANT: 
It's a small restaurant. When your order is ready they just yell your number (with take out they yell your name). The lines are out the door long BUT THEY MOVE PRETTY FAST! That's a good thing. Staff was very helpful (for newbies like me, lol I asked questions)! Waiters and waitresses that walked pass did greet me. They have all kinds of flavor tea even had watermelon tea (which was good). NOW the food runners had on gloves which is good ONLY IF YOU ARE JUST TOUCHING FOOD ONLY AND CHANGING GLOVES!!!!!!! So I watch this one young lady (while standing in line) she had on gloves she was in her pocket, she went to the front where the cashier were, she picked up a stapler and they other cashier took it out her hand, she  touched the wall (she moving out the way) and then she went and picked up some plates to take out to guest. ALL OF THAT AND NOT ONCE DID SHE CHANGE HER GLOVES! So I just don't understand why the gloves????? It's not because the plates are hot because the type of gloves they were wearing will not protect from heat. 

NEXT VISIT: 
Yes I have to do back because again my husband heard so many good thing about the BBQ. So I will update my review :) with the BBQ"}
{"text":"This place is really good. My only beef with them is it took me forever to place an order because nobody like to answer the phone apparently but I'ma assume they were just that damn busy so I'm not gon hold that against them. I got the chicken quarter with the Mac n cheese on the side. If your Mac n cheese doesn't impress, you will never see me again... But I must say I was very pleased with the Mac, and the chicken was good too. Thank you for the good meal, smoke pit. I'll be back."}
{"text":"If you like BBQ, then this is the place.  It gets a little crowded around dinner time but this is really a neat spot.  Everything on the menu is full flavored, cooked on site and really \"comfort food\".  Huge portions and you can get the ribs with a rub or wet.  

Nothing about this place is fancy but the food is excellent."}
{"text":"The Smoke Pit is some of the best food you can get in this part of the country.  Large portions make it potentially a 2-day meal for whatever you get....and you will be happy for that.  HIGHLY recommend - it is outstanding BBQ!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in NC. I highly recommend the brisket and fried okra with Texas toast! The line for food can be out the door but it is well worth the wait! Make sure to get there before closing time or they might end up running out of meat because so many people enjoy it. Overall great restaurant just be ready to over eat and enjoy it."}
{"text":"Well the yelp reviews were right about this place.  It was good food and LARGE portions!  Plus we stopped by on a Wednesday and you get an extra side for free which was great.  I had the pulled chicken bbq sandwich and my husband had the pork bbq.  Pictures below.  In a random spot but so worth the drive!"}
{"text":"We stopped at this place on a suggestion of a local. We had the Texas Brisket and the Pulled Pork platters. If you like a lot of meat, this place is for you. Great smoke flavor on the meat and the deviled egg potato salad was phenomenal. Be sure to go hungry or take it home as leftovers. The best place for barbecue so far in North Carolina."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and great food when you can get inside.  Parking is a problem and It is a very small place. I had a BBQ salad, it is big enough to serve 2"}
{"text":"I went here based on the recommendation of coworkers and it is awesome! I've tried the beef brisket, pork ribs, white slaw, beans, fried okra, and the Stock Market sandwich. Everything I've tried has great flavor. All portions are very generous. Any of the pictures you see in the reviews are accurate. You won't leave hungry.

You order at the counter, find a table, and they bring your order to you. Don't let the long order line scare you. From the time you place your order until you receive your food is pretty quick. Finding a place to sit could be an issue since they don't allow someone in your party to grab a seat before you've placed your order. The place does fill up but tables clear out in good time; however, so finding tables for large parties (more than 4) could be hard if you want to sit together."}
{"text":"We frequent this place, and it is delicious.  Thier ribs and brisket ate the best.  We always get the four item combo cor 27.95, double ribs, brisket and wings, and choice of two sides  Make sure get there early because when they run out, they are out. We came today at 6 and they were out alreafy.  For two peole being able to eat for under $30, you cant go wrong.  My sister in law had the smoke pit cater her wedding, and they did an amazing job."}
{"text":"I stopped in not long after this place opened.  I got the pulled pork sandwich and it was so good I order it every time I go back.  I'm not typically a huge fan of vinegar based barbecue sauce but I end up drenching my sandwich in this stuff; it has just the right amount of kick to it.  I don't get to go very often but enjoy it every time I do."}
{"text":"Best BBQ hands down anywhere I have ever been. There wasn't a bad thing on my plate from here. Awesome food, Awesome Staff and Good Pricing"}
{"text":"First time eating at the Smoke Pit. Heard about it from the owner's wife. Wonderful BBQ and the best side dishes.  I got the large pulled plate and will be able to make multiple meals. Not fancy but great food and service."}
{"text":"By far the best brisket I've ever eaten. I was sitting there speechless on how buttery the beef was. Do yourself a favor and order it! Texas can't hold a candle to this BBQ or at least not anywhere I have found yet!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Love the baked beans and potato salad. Also the pulled pork. You get a lot for your money!"}
{"text":"First time here I had the pulled pork spud, my boyfriend had chicken quarters with sweet potato casserole and baked beans, the food was amazing! We had to bring a group of friends and family back and when we did, we ordered one of each cobbler ( blueberry, strawberry, and peach) and it was to die for! Service was great as well! Definitely our new favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"Just the best. Simply the best! Brisket was outstanding! Sides are perfect! Get there just before lunch time if you want to get a seat and full menu selection...if you wait, they may run out of food!"}
{"text":"The food was good. Brisket was very tender, pulled pork and Cole slaw were great. KC sauce made everything pop! Very long wait though...and we had a reservation."}
{"text":"Best Barbeque in the Charlotte Metro area....fair priced for the quality.....need more parking and seating"}
{"text":"This place has got to be my fav BBQ spot!!!!   Come prepared for a wait, it seems that at any given time, the line is out the door.   Limited indoor seating makes for up to a 45 minute wait.

Come hungry because the portions are huge!   You can easily share a 3 meat or 4 meat platter.   On my last trip, I did 4 meat platter - St. Louis ribs, Brisket (fatty cut), burnt ends and wings.  The meal comes with two sides!  Mac-n-cheese is to die for!!!!!!!    I had to tap out about half way through, that is okay, I had a nice snack to look forward too.  

I did not take any pics as most of the pics on Yelp are pretty accurate.  The place is awesome, 'nuff said......"}
{"text":"Hearing my son talk about this place I just had to stop in..I've never been to a place to eat that come in one door that divides BBQ on one side meat market on the other.First lets eat,you walk up to a counter and place you order and get a number as so you can sit at a table then..I chose a Burnt end sandwich plus 4 wings and a side of potato salad,and a tea belly washer. My oldest son got 12 wings with Alabama sauce.He and I traded a few wings I had the sweet southern sauce. One was just as good as the other.Your food comes out on a tray with piece of butcher paper on it.My burnt ends was on Texas Toast. My other son had the same sandwich as me. He'd been here before to. That time he brought home some Brisket and sausage links both very good.Our Sandwich had so much meat on them we had to eat them with a fork.So much meat you could not hold It.The meat was so tender, sauce sweet and sticky finger licking good.The potato salad was ok but I'll try their mack and cheese the next time, one of my sons had it and liked it..Have a Big appetite when you go cause they give you plenty. My smoked wings where very good and big ol wings on top of that.They did not come off a little chicken plus it is the whole wing.You had a choice of Ribs,Chicken,Pork and Brisket.Also a couple kinds of a spud or Baked potato loaded.Several sides to chose from. Some one came by checking to see If we where pleased with our meal several times. My youngest son and myself got to see how they cooked the meats and was very Impressed.The 3 of us got out four a hint over 50.00. It ain't cheap but was good.Next door was the meat market that was very impressive to.We came home with some thing to cook for supper all in one stop.We will be back. My oldest son told me he and his wife eat there once a week.We don't live that close."}
{"text":"Bring your appetite...definitely the best bbq around. We decided to get the 4 meal combo...brisket (to die for), wings (yum yum), pulled pork (awesome), and ribs (good). Portion sizes huge, great service, and sides great too (husband loved the collards.)  We are going to have to be rolled out of here. We will be back...only problem is parking kind of tight."}
{"text":"every part of the meal was excellent.  corn bread, beans, broccoli, turkey, to die for. the nicest service to boot. I'll be back"}
{"text":"The best place for BBQ in the area.  The portions are huge, but that does not mean the quality is not there. The burnt ends are perfect, even better than the ones in Kansas City. The pulled pork is perfect, no sauce just the flavor of the wood.  Simply the best around."}
{"text":"We recently moved to Charlotte from the Detroit area where we had a good selection of good BBQ and we were blown away by the smoke pit. It's in an unassuming location and they close early but the BBQ was outstanding, the portions were way bigger than we had expected for the price and the service was friendly. I ordered pulled pork and brisket and they were both smoked and seasoned beautifully. Had mac and cheese and collards for sides and those were excellent as well. A must try if you're in the charlotte area!"}
{"text":"Best burnt end sandwich.  Heaven!!  Just wish they served fresh cut fries vs frozen though.  They do add spices, but, still frozen fries. 

This is our go-to BBQ place."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best barbecue in the greater Charlotte area! I have tried everything on the menu at least once and I haven't found something I don't like. The food is delicious and the staff is highly recommended. Not sure what to try? Burnt ends is your answer. The menu is a little pricey but they are serving trays of food not plates. It's enough to to split unless you have to have to try it all like me. Even then the have some combo meals that will satisfy all your heart's desires."}
{"text":"Amazing food for a pretty good price 
We ordered over the phone. We got a  \"choose 2\" with St. Louis smoked ribs and sweet BBQ wings with a side of mac and cheese and baked beans. When we picked up our food the lovely young lady gave us a drink for free .

Let's just say today was a good day!"}
{"text":"I went to the Smoke Pit with my husband. The line was long, as usual, but we waited. I was disappointed to learn when I got all the way to the register that they were out of the smoked chicken quarters which is what I wanted. Nevertheless, I had the pulled chicken with pork n beans and macaroni and cheese. My beans were really salty and extremely saucy. My chicken was also heavily laden with barbecue sauce, and it wasn't as tender as I would have liked. It was more like chicken chunks than pulled chicken. The macaroni was pretty good. My husband had the brisket and that was very good. Overall, I was disappointed with my food this go round, but my husband's was enjoyable. Next time I hope they'll have the chicken quarters, because I've enjoyed those."}
{"text":"I have been several times to this establishment. I have ordered the pulled pork, brisket, and salads.  The Mac and cheese side is delicious. The pulled pork plate is well served although the last time it had significantly less meat than previous visits. The brisket was delicious the first time but was disappointed by the fatty portion the second. The salad is one of my favorites because it is very filling."}
{"text":"I am in town for business, and decided to eat at \"The Smoke Pit\" since so many people on Yelp liked it. I DID NOT. I did not know that their sauce is vinegar based. Yuck! I got the pulled pork plate with baked beans and mac n cheese to go. The mac n cheese is dry, the baked beans are ok, and that THIN VINEGAR based sauce is on the flavorless pulled pork which made the meat VERY SOGGY. DID I SAY YUCK?!?!? I am not sure why this place is called \"The Smoke Pit\" because the meat has no smoky flavor AT ALL. Please save your $ bcs I just got full off of Texas Toast. I'm going to toss it bcs I don't want any reminders of the $ I spent on such an awful meal."}
{"text":"This place is worth the wait!!

Stopped by for a little bite to eat today for lunch. This is one of my favorite spots in Concord!! I got the \"Burnt Ends\" platter today and was delightfully satisfied per usual. There's not a thing on this menu that you won't love.

I do have to say, make sure you have plenty of time when you go because the lines can get long and wait can be a little longer than you're used to. 

Check out this amazing Concord gem and you won't leave disappointed or dissatisfied!"}
{"text":"First time dining here. It was delicious!  The brisket was juicy. The pulled pork had great flavor and don't get me started on the chicken!  That Alabama sauce and the char/smokey flavor,incredible! The sides were good also.  I prefer my greens a little smaller cut. Potato salad has a \"deviled egg\" taste. Loved it! No room for dessert this time, so I guess we'll have to go back soon."}
{"text":"Definitely 5 stars for the food. The portions are BIG. I easily had 2 lbs of pulled pork on my tray. The meat was tender and flavorful. The sauce is western style and on the sweet side but compliments the smoky meat. The cornbread was so moist. It's the best I've had from a bbq joint! We had deviled egg potato salad, fries, and mac n cheese for sides. All were good. The mac n cheese and potato salad were both homemade. Pulled pork plates are $10 and worth it! We brought home enough leftovers for another meal.

Drawbacks - the parking is sparse. Call-in orders have to wait in line with dine-in folks. Expect a long line on a busy night. You order at a counter and get a number. It took about 45 min for us to order and get our food. It seems like it would make more sense for them to have waitstaff, like that would speed up the process."}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ and amazing service, very friendly.  The Burnt Ends, Ribs and Brisket were awesome and the hubby thought the sausage link was surprisingly good. The Deviled Egg Potato Salad was delicious and like mom makes, yellow, mustardy, eggy, potato goodness."}
{"text":"First time here. I had the slider meal with mach and cheese, both very good. Best mach and cheese I have had in awhile. Reason for the , my mother had sweet potato fries, they were cold and rubbery. Sauce was very good. If i had time, I would have bought some sauce."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had been meaning to try this place for a while and finally went this week. I definitely regret that we had waited so long! This was the best barbecue I have ever eaten. We ate the ribs, chicken and pulled pork. They were all amazing and the ribs literally fell off the bone. The sides were perfect too, perfectly cooked collards greens and baked macaroni and cheese. The portions were huge and the prices were fair. I will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"So far this is the best BBQ I've ever had in the NC, Concord/Charlotte area! So good it makes you wanna slap your mama! I had the rib plate with mac and cheese and greens, my husband had the beef brisket with the same sides. Everything was delicious! I know cause I was making noise while I was eating. Couldn't help it but yum-yum-yum-yum-yum! My family and I will definitely be eating BBQ food from here from now on!"}
{"text":"Concord's best kept secret. Quick service and a great staff to get you in and out. My favorite is the beef brisket"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Smoke Pit Saturday with our daughter and son-in-law for an early Fathers Day Lunch.  This was our first visit and we were excited to try based on the reviews and the line out the door.  Well we were totally disappointed!!!!  

My husband & I both ordered a 2 meat combo w 2 sides. I had pulled pork & St Louis ribs wet with potato salad & mac n cheese.  Husband had pulled pork & St Louis ribs dry w French fries & collards.  Well they give you a good amount of food however it wasn't that good.   We both thought the pulled pork was good if you like the vinegar base they use.  I had to add sweet barbecue sauce to tame the vinegar.... (I'm a GA girl).  The French fries were the only good side with any seasoning.... the other 3 were tasteless!  We took the ribs home to eat later.... boy were we surprised when we tried to eat them and discovered were mostly FAT & GRISTLE!!!! Sooooo disappointed.  This visit was an absolute waste of $40!!!!! Never again!"}
{"text":"I have a hard time finding smoked BBQ that I like, Yelp has let me down in the past, not this time. I ordered the brisket and half rack of ribs with dry rub. The brisket was incredible, beautiful salty bark, with a nice clean smoky flavor. Passes the pull test, doesn't need a drop of sauce, but out of the three they provide you at the table they were all pretty good. Vinegar, regular BBQ, and some sort of spicy BBQ sauce were all very tasty. The St. Louis pork ribs had an excellent bark, not very noticeable smoke rings but that isn't important, the meat was very tender. Had less smoke flavor so I had to use BBQ sauce to help it along, still top quality ribs. I might come back here every day this week because the brisket was that good.

{"text":"Plenty of really good food, great variety, and decent service. They also cater and do an excellent job."}
{"text":"Love this place. Finally I've found BBQ like I had in Texas! 
Great chicken good brisket and can't go wrong with sides. Our church has this catered a lot and I'm so glad when they do!"}
{"text":"Wow, this is the spot if you're hungry and want some good BBQ!  Portions are huge!  We split a 4 meat combo and still had leftovers- which is saying something feeding my weightlifter husband and I!  Ribs are awesome, pork isn't fatty...cornbread is delicious and they hook it up for both people!  They aren't open on Sunday's unfortunately so come get your fix Monday through Saturday!  It's always packed."}
{"text":"Update from Jan 2015 review.... It has gotten better over the last few months. Good portions, side are good, and the wait staff have gotten much better too! Good job guys!"}
{"text":"Our to go BBQ place in our home town. If you have out of town visitors you have to bring them here or order pickup. The place gets full but don't let the line discourage you, it is well worth the wait. Prices are extremely reasonable when you consider the quality and quantity, any plate can be easily shared or don't share and take some home.

I always order the wet ribs and pulled pork platter, they have great sides like fried okra, real mac and cheese, sweet potato casserole just to name a few. If you are trying to be healthier their salads are awesome, topped with pilles pork, chicken or brisket.

They offer a great selection of BBQ sauces, try them all, you won't be disappointed.

For dessert not they we always have room they have several cobblers to chose from."}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times and I've yet to have a bad meat or side. Banana Pudding is a different story. Multiple visits I've had

Pulled Pork - I love their pulled pork. I've had some every visit. Great smoke hit, excellent flavor and moisture in the meat. They also give you some outside brown or bark. Their Piedmont Style sauce is also very good.

Sausage - Yes! I'm a fan of smoked sausage and theirs is awesome. They give you a mustard sauce to dip the cut sausage in, but I found all of their sauces complemented the meat well.

Brisket - One of the harder meats to prepare correctly. However, they've got one of the best briskets you'll find in North Carolina! Everything you or at least I look for, great smoke flavor, moisture in the meat leave me some fat and of the outside bark. 

Bake Beans - I love their baked beans, I add some of their pork to make them even better

Green Bean Casserole - Excellent

Hash brown Casserole - first place I've tasted this, very good.

White Slaw - yeah, they have a good slaw

Potato Salad - Again, Excellent

banana pudding - first time I had it, it was runny pudding something crumbled that resembled a nilla wafer; but too small quantity to figure out. Large portion but overall average. They'll get a second chance when I can get back AND they have it. Last time they took my order for it but never delivered it."}
{"text":"Excellent smoked flavor. Ribs fall off the bone. Fries are the best! We happen to find this place on Yelp while driving home from Winston Salem to Charlotte. There was a line when we got there around 6pm. The line got longer around 7pm. Know that there is probably a line always."}
{"text":"The head cook is gone now and you can tell by the product. Not as good. This place was good for meat, however it has lost it all it's appeal. The sides were always lackluster but they've gotten even worse. The portions used to be large enough for lunch and dinner, now you don't care about portions being lessened."}
{"text":"Literally so good.. never let down. I've been here multiple times and each time is better than the last. You can't go wrong with anything because it's all so good. Unless something goes horribly wrong I'll always be back. You can't ever go wrong with good bbq."}
{"text":"The Smoke Pit is my absolute favorite. It's the best Barbeque around. It's just down the street from my work which is how I was able to find it. Sometimes we'll go for lunch, though we regret it afterwards as we just want to lay around and enjoy the delicious meal we just consumed. I love the Burnt Ends Sandwich and the Pulled Pork Spud. Definitely set aside some time if you are planning on eating here as the wait can be long at times. Though afterwards you can go over to the Stock Market which is the grocery store that is attached and get some very good reasonably priced meat and more!"}
{"text":"Absolutely deeelicious! The ribs and brisket are tender and sooo flavorful. I usually beg my dad to pick up the 2 or 3 meat platter anytime I come to town. The servings are very generous so its great for sharing or dinner and lunch the next day. When I'm going for the 3 meats I add the chicken wings. While the meats are the STARS, the side are pretty good as well; I usually get the greens and mac&cheese. Each time I've gone the staff has been very nice -which matters so much to me. All around good stuff. Now that I'm talking about it, I may have to take a trip down 85. Lol."}
{"text":"Good food makes you feel bad about wasting space in your stomach with all the other food you've ever eaten. The Smoke Pit makes you feel this way. The food was amazing and well worth the wait in line and risking the chance that all the tables may be taken. I live 2 hours away but I will be planning future trips around this place."}
{"text":"The Smoke Pit does not disappoint.  I take all my family to eat here when they are in town. I love the sweet potato casserole and the corn bread.  Everything I have had has been great. I have lived in Texas for the last 10 years so I don't think the brisket is quite comparable, but the pork, IMO,  is the best thing on the menu.  The portions are so large you could easily split a meal with someone.  Unless you are really hungry or just want left overs."}
{"text":"Can't say enough about the cafeteria tray we inhaled while traveling to the Monroe area for business.  Burnt ends, fried okra, cornbread, 'red' southern slaw...all thrown back with some sweet tea.  We'll be back"}
{"text":"I love great BBQ and this spot hit the mark . The ribs are out of this world good and the mac and cheese was melt in your mouth great. Very cool little North Carolina stop that I would recommend to anyone looking to grab a quick and good lunch in the area."}
{"text":"Quick service, good hospitality, and amazing food. That's all there is to really say. I'm from NJ, so I'm not used to southern BBQ and I don't have a benchmark to compare this place to. What I can say is that those ribs were some of best I've ever had in my life, and the corn bread was by far the best I've ever had. 

One parting note: THE PORTIONS ARE HUGE! If you are going there for dinner, skipping lunch might be a good idea."}
{"text":"We ate here a few weeks ago on a Saturday night. They were really busy and we hesitated staying. We stayed and the brisket sandwich was yummy!! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Very large portions. Traditional bbq cuts and choices include brisket burnt ends. Ribs are over priced but the other plates and sandwiches are well priced for the value and guaranteed leftovers. Sides are okay just know when the description says kicking or sizzling they mean there is a hot heat to the flavor. Safer to ask for the sauces on the side as they are all on the tables. Will come again to try something else."}
{"text":"Ordered 3 full racks of ribs, 2 lbs of pulled pork.  They handed us the pulled pork. I had to show them they did not have our 3 rack of ribs in the bag. We felt the pork was short also. Got home and weighed our pork to find we only received 1 lb 7 oz of pulled pork.  The food is good but attention to service/detail was lacking today.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"When I tell people how I feel about The Smoke Pit, they look at me like I have 3 heads, but honestly, I just don't get it. Yes, you'll get a big portion, but for me it's too much, (and admittedly if food is in front of me, I'm more likely to get overstuffed than ask for a take-home box! MY issue, not there's...moving on....)

The meats are ok, but for me too dry. I've had their catered pulled pork at several events, and that tray is DYING for some sauce. I also find the sides to be too heavy. I don't know if it's just too much butter or fat in the cooking, but it wasn't for me. The beans had a funky taste to them that didn't jive with me, and overall there was way too much salt."}
{"text":"Went to supper with my boss tonight around 545 on 5/22. The place was full but service was good and timely. 
I ordered the 2 meat sampler....pulled pork was good, smoked Texas brisket was a tad on the dry side, the baked beans, coleslaw and cornbread were good. 
The portions were very large and plentiful, while fairly priced."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Concord. You can order online and pick up now. Doesn't get much easier or better!"}
{"text":"Literally the first BBQ place at which I was unable to finish a 3-meat combo plate. The Smoke Pit is the champion!

The brisket, ribs, and pulled pork were all incredible. Normally brisket and ribs are some of my favorites, but there is something special about the pulled pork here. It beats out the ribs and brisket in my opinion. It was moist, juicy, smoky, and well-seasoned. The ribs were perfectly cooked ... not quite fall-off-the bone, which is what ribs should be. You can't go wrong with any of these BBQ staples at The Smoke Pit.

The night I was here happened to also be extra side night, so I got to try three sides. Got the hashbrown casserole, BBQ beans, and deviled egg potato salad. The BBQ beans even had decent-sized chunks of pork. Great sides. Extra side night might have contributed to my failure to finish my meal.

This place is amazing. I'm saddened by the thought that it's 1,500 miles from home."}
{"text":"Food: 5 out of 5 stars

Great. Simple. Excellent barbeque. 

The online ordering experience could be improved. The menu allows you to order 3 items when the menu item you selected might be two on a plate. Often they are out of items and you'll receive a call after the fact with them asking what you want to do since the item is not available...you'd think there'd be a feature that would allow them to turn items on and off when they run out so that users would be prevented from ordering that item. You also can't delete an item from your cart when ready to check out...you have to cancel the whole order and start over. It also takes a significantly higher number of clicks to select items and check out.

Most of the time the line is out the door even when there are plenty of tables available. It seems like there's opportunity to improve the ordering efficiency. 

However, I'll keep going back and back regardless because the food is delicious and even if the online experience isn't perfect, it still gets the job done and I'm glad they allow you to put in an order that way."}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time the other day. Food is great! Great service!would recommend to everyone! Will be back when we're in town! Thanks"}
{"text":"Well, it's amazing. I can stop there but I won't. I ordered the ribs and the people I was with ordered sliders, chicken and brisket. We all tasted each other's food and everyone was equally impressed with one another's dishes. My favorite was the brisket. It was so tender and spiced so perfectly. 
The sides are fantastic too. I got the green bean casserole and collard greens and both were yummy. 
The corn bread is so so good with real corn in it and it's sweet and moist. 
I will be going back. I can't believed I've lived here all these  years and just tried it for the first time."}
{"text":"Great place! Worth the wait. I've been twice. Drove from Charlotte. So far the southern sweet chicken wings are my favorite!!! All the sides are amazing!!! My favs are sweet potatoe casserole, Mac n cheese, and even the corn bread is so tasty!!"}
{"text":"Such a delicious food! Coming here is always great! Get the pulled pork plate trust me you won't regret it"}
{"text":"Awesome food!  Generous portions! The chef really knows his way around a kitchen. This is a really great place to eat. The smoked meats are droolicious!!!!
The brisket is something you will crave... And at these great prices...I'll be eating here a lot!!  Not to mention getting take out... Or getting a full brisket for a family, holiday celebration!!  Cannot go wrong eating here!!!!

I am dreaming about their brisket!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The Ribs was awesome , macaroni good, and deviled egg potato salad was ok. I will definitely come back and order!"}
{"text":"Speechless! I got a burnt ends brisket sandwich, mac & cheese, fries, and slaw. Served on butchers paper. Loved that part. The brisket was everywhere. Way more than the bread could hold. Has to be the best brisket I've ever had. Tea is very sweet mix it half and half if you can. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place is, hands down, the BEST barbeque I have ever had. The brisket is amazing. The pork is tender and the sides are authentic home cookin'. 
There is a line out the door at any given time so order pickup if you're in a hurry. 
The parking is the only negative about the entire Smoke Pit experience but at the same time...you know it's good food if you fill up your parking lot and all neighboring businesses parking lots!"}
{"text":"We ventured out to this location with my parents who had previously been and raved about it. 
We were not disappointed. The meat was outstanding. We got a pick three which came with 2 sides and a bread. We got the brisket, ribs (dry), and pulled pork. Beans and potato salad as sides and corn bread. Every thing was super delicious. The potato salad was classic yellow and on point with the vinegariness. Beans had a hint of peppers and came with pulled pork in them as well. Corn bread was sweet and perfect, not too dry. 
Let's get to the meat:
Brisket-From what I understand this is traditional Texas style. I have never been to Texas but this meat was spectacular. Juicy but not too fatty. Came with great dipping sauce. 
Ribs-These were my FAV. Tender and toothy. A 6 bone portion if I remember right. Just the right amount if smokiness. 
Pulled pork-Tender,smokey,succulent. This is not your average NC style pulled pork. It comes unsauced but with a delicious one in the side.
We had a fantastic time. The dinning room was packed full of patrons but clean and quiet. The quietness caught me off guard. Then I realized it was so quiet because people had their pie holes full of the best BBQ ever. 
I will be going back soon."}
{"text":"Very good!! I came here with a friend from HS who works in Concorde and he swore this was the best BBQ place, I totally agree! I know that everyone says they have experienced \"the best\" and it's always subjective, but this was indeed a very good place. 

I got the brisket and had Mac and cheese as a side. I really like the taste of the brisket with the sauce. It was fantastic. I feel they give a generous portion as well. 

The ambiance is \"crowded\". Lol. It is usually filled with a line out the door. That is the sign of a good restaurant. 

This is a place I try to come to when in the Concorde area."}
{"text":"I really like this place, but after some one takes you to Bobby O's in Huntersville. Wow! Bobby knows his BBQ and sauce. That place knocks it out of the park! When on that side of the tracks, check it out. You will leave pleased."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch during the week. It took 22 minutes to get 2 kids tenders and a salad. The salad was terrible. Chicken was tough and the blueberries were rotten. I also asked for no bacon and still found some on my salad. That could have been a disaster if I were allergic."}
{"text":"Went to smoke pit today. As usual the line was out the door,  ordered the smoked chicken quarters, fried okra, sweet potato casserole.  The chicken had good crunch on it however didn't really taste any smoke. The fried okra was good as well as the sweet potato casserole.  My only concern is that if its called the smoke pit, I wanna taste the smoke.  Maybe next time!"}
{"text":"Thanks to Tinkk, The Smoke Pit really smoked the competition! The very personable and hospitable Tinkk at the front counter steered us in the right direction on our first visit to The Smoke Pit! We wanted to sample everything, so the closest thing to that was to get the four meat combo. So that's exactly what we did! We chose brisket, pulled pork, whole wings, and ribs! Topped with two sides for which we chose the collards and Mac n cheese! The brisket was the best I've ever had with a succulent moist meat with crispy burnt ends! The pulled pork was extremely moist, crispy bark edges, and barely any sauce to allow the smoked pork to speak for itself! The wings were deep fried to a nice crunchy exterior, but still left with a nice juicy white meat interior! The St. Louis style ribs, which normally I never order, was ordered dry rubbed and was literally smoked to the point of falling off the bone! The collards and Mac n Cheese were literally homemade and perhaps equally as impressive as the meats and the best I've had at a restaurant! BTW, please choose that sweet cornbread over the Texas toast as you'll be quite impressed with the quality and uniqueness of the bread! This southern gentleman was impressed and ready to come back for more smokey goodness!

After my second visit I'm sure that this is the best BBQ in all of the Charlotte area!  The one downside to The Smoke Pit is the have a horrible process of seating/paying/delivering your food.  So much so that even their staff gets frustrated and barks at each other and even comes back to the kitchen area with trays of food complaining that they can't deliver the food.  Little do they know that you can hear all of this from the Men's restroom.  Unprofessional, but understood due to the discombobulated way of processing your order!
The food makes you forget all of that as it's the best wings, brisket, and Q in the area!"}
{"text":"This place is great!  Nothing fancy but delish!  HUGE portions!  Go hungry!"}
{"text":"Their food is AMAZING! I loved the chicken and their Mac n cheese is SO HEARTY!! I would recommend anyone try this place because I have never been a fan of BARBECUE but their chicken has me addicted!"}
{"text":"Shut down every other BBQ joint in a 50 mile radius, because this place blows them all out of the water. I've lived in Kannapolis for 3 years and I've just recently found the Smoke Pit. I'm kicking myself for every time I've eaten at another BBQ restaurant. What isn't delicious here??  The burnt ends are one of the best things I've ever put in my beak. The pulled pork tastes like sweet baby piggies, and the deviled egg potato salad will make you cry tears of joy.  Also, the portions are large enough to feed a ravenous pack of wolves. Go. Go now."}
{"text":"Love this place! Tends to get overwhelmingly busy, so cashiers can be a little short during these times. I never complain as the food and waitresses completely make up for it!"}
{"text":"Great Food, expect a wait. The dry rub BBQ is noticeably better than the wet BBQ.  Both are fantastic, but the real winner is the DRY rubbed BBQ."}
{"text":"The best bbq ever!!! Lineis always out the door!! Everyone needs to try! I got the pulled bbq chicken with the sweet sauce on a bun and it was so delicious. It's ALWAYS delicious and I've never been disappointed"}
{"text":"Awesome little place!!!! BBQ,ribs, and sausage were great!!! Baked beans were perfect! Would def return!"}
{"text":"OMG! And wow! nearly worth the drive from Raleigh just to eat here! After a day of shopping at outlets in Charlotte I found this spot on yelp, I have lived in North Carolina since the 90's and this is hands down the best BBQ I have eaten, we had a party of 3, I ordered the chicken wings with dragon sauce they were huge whole wings perfectly smoked and cooked, moist and not overcooked, best wings ever next I ordered a 3 meat combo plate with pulled pork, BBQ ribs and brisket and again they do not disappoint the brisket had a perfect smoke and was so moist and tender going to have to make an excuse to come back, overall great experience one of the workers said she loved working here it is reflected in the experience"}
{"text":"This was really disappointing.  We did not get a chance to eat but the smell was very appealing.  The reason we left was because there was no promise of a place to sit. You first have to order your food, and then wait for a table to open up.  If your food comes out before a table opens up, then I suppose you have to stand there and hold your food?  The tables only are large enough for 4 people so if you have more than 4 (we had 6), the chances of you getting two tables to free up next to each other is slim.  We were there at 7 p.m.   may be okay if you get there real early."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Stoped here for a bite to eat on a road trip. Definitely not your average the run of the mill BBQ joint. The food was packed with flavor. The sides they offered were amazing."}
{"text":"A meat market and BBQ joint...the ultimate combo. This is my new Charlotte area favorite, since the Dixie Pig in Rock Hill, SC lost its way. 
Atmosphere, Menu Selection, Staff, Tea.... all on point and best of all - CONSISTENTLY DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"Totally agree with the previous reviews, this place has great food...was in Concord for high school football playoff game, The Smoke Pit was 2 miles from stadium...glad I read the reviews and came here, the line was out the door but moved at a good pace...had the pulled pork, dry ribs and brisket, baked beans and BBQ slaw...very generous portions, see photo...these guys know what they're doing, I do agree the brisket was a tad dry but the wonderful sauces made up for it...I will be back, keep up the great work...this is how BBQ should be"}
{"text":"OMG! This place is AMAZING! Best BBQ place I have ever been to! LOVED the wings and Mac &a Cheese... honestly everything I tried was great! Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Well where do I begin.  I ordered four bones of ribs and four jumbo wings.  For sides I ordered collards, beans and fried okra.  Let's do the good first.  The wings were great.  They were all three pieces hence JUMBO.  The collards were good but no pepper vinegar.  Oh well.  The beans were good too but needed more meat in them.  I don't think they were smoked as stated.   Now for the not so good.  The fried okra might have been good if it had been hot.  In fact everything except the wings was warm at best.  Now for the ribs.  I travel constantly so I go to a lot of BBQ stops.   I think I'm somewhat of a rib expert.  These were baked and put on a hot box.  Ribs are NOT supposed to fall off the bone.  You should be able to take a bite and have it come away from the bone leaving the rest of the meat on the bone.  These fell off the bone when I picked them up.  They weren't cut into individual ribs and I know why, they fell apart completely.   Their taste was that of baked ribs with no smoke flavor.   Some like that and that's fine.  I don't!!  This place seems to be just a fast food BBQ restaurant.  Everything is cooked long in advance and dished for service.  Most sides can be held in a hot box but not fried or fried okra.  The wings helped to get the extra star.  Needless to say I won't be back!!"}
{"text":"I thought I had carefully planned my lunch visit to the Smoke Pit so I would arrive right after they opened and avoid a line.  Other folks had the same idea.  After eating lunch I understood the popularity of this unique restaurant.

First off, the dining area is clean.  It looks clean and smells clean and nicely decorated in an appropriate theme for the type of restaurant it is.  They have a health grade of 97 posted.

The cashier was very polite and knowledgeable of the menu.  I ordered the beef brisket sandwich with a side of baked beans to go.  There was a short wait to receive my food.   The sandwich with one side was $10.95.  My sandwich was heaping with an abundance perfectly seasoned beef brisket.  It was flavorful but  the smoke and seasoning didn't overpower the taste.  The baked beans were seasoned with the light taste of barbecue sauce and little pulled was added for flavor.

I look forward to trying this place again!  I didn't get to sample their desserts that looked really good.  Next visit I know to come early and come hungry."}
{"text":"I went to the Smoke Pit in Salisbury for the first time this past Saturday and I loved it..I got the pulled chicken plate with fries,Mac and cheese and that corn bread was all that!!!!!! A must try for anyone that loves BBQ and great service"}
{"text":"Very good BBQ joint! Food was delicious, we had the pulled pork and brisket. Both very good and tender and flavorful. Friendly and pleasant staff. Large proportion sizes. Very quick with ordering and getting out the food. This place is one of the better BBQ places I have ate at."}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding! Prices typical of BBQ, but the portions were gargantuan. 
My dad ordered the 8 wings and they took up the whole tray. I saw a salad on someone's table and it was the biggest salad I have ever seen in a restaurant. 
Everything was delicious, the meat tender and full of flavor. Best pulled pork I've ever had. The potato salad was delicious, which is saying a lot because the ONLY potato salad I like is my moms. Even the bread options, cornbread and Texas toast, were well done. Slaw was typical, nothing stand out about it, but I even liked the fried okra, which I never like. 
If you're a fat-phob I wouldn't get the brisket, very fatty. But if you're okay with fat the flavor was incredible! 
Very happy we took the detour and found this place! My parents have found a new place to bring the children when we visit!"}
{"text":"This might've been the best catering experience ever! We do a lot of events and this was the most delicious and well organized. The food arrived hot and early. Chase and Jeremy were beyond great to deal with! I will definitely be using them for future events!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ for. 30 miles. Can compete with the big boys in Lexington and the Q in the Queen City.  Defiantly a must, and the portions are out of bounds.  Service could be better but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Excellent food and nice atmosphere.   My wife, son, and I went and was very impressed by the portions and taste of the BBQ.  The 3 of us all had leftovers and left stuffed.  I felt like $27 for our meal was very reasonable.  We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Brisket and pulled pork special was enough for four meals, fantastic taste, required NO seasoning. Sweet potato fries could have been crisp and hot, they were not. I didn't ask for new ones b/c I had so much other food. They should get a license to sell beer."}
{"text":"Tried this place out today. I had heard about it from a friend of mine. I had the burnt ends sandwich and mac and cheese. The burnt ends were the best I've tasted in the area. They were crispy on the outside and oh so moist in the middle and had the best flavor. I ordered carryout but looking foward to dining in. I would actually give them 5 stars but there was an issue with their online system. So by the time I got there, they had not gotten my online order. So i had to wait another 20 minutes for my food when i had ordered it online 30 minutes prior. Other than that...great bbq!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. I had the brisket sandwich and a side of baked macaroni. Brisket had good flavor, but for a sandwich, I would have liked to see less clumps of fat. Baked macaroni was less than impressive. No salt, didn't taste like cheese, and had a grainy over floured texture. A little attention to detail would have made a huge difference."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to us by people who frequent it and we were not disappointed.

Food: 4/5. Portions are HUGE and one plate is enough for 2-3 meals. I had the pulled chicken which was good but I liked a sweeter BBQ sauce. The sides are phenomenal though!! The sweet potato casserole - omg, you must try it. I would rate everything a 5 if it had my preferred bbq sauce. 

Atmosphere: 4/5. Kind of a small dining room but nice for a BBQ joint. Outside is not too impressive but the inside is very clean and laid out nicely for traffic walk-through. The line NEVER stopped even at 4pm in the afternoon. It moves relatively fast though. Great place for a casual family dinner.

Service: Everyone is friendly and courteous, with southern charm. Really enjoyed their pleasant staff!

Overall: 4/5. Great food, just add a sweeter BBQ sauce! :)"}
{"text":"One of the most confusing barbeque experiences I've had. Between the line this place seems to constantly have, and the incredible reviews you would think it was amazing but my experience was thoroughly mediocre. I had ribs and brisket with mac & cheese and fried okra. Unfortunately the fried okra was the most noteworthy part of my meal. The meats weren't bad, they were just ok, but when I factor in the hefty price tag and wait time I knock off another star."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite BBQ place!
The food was amazing. The brisket was the best I've had.  My husband had a combo platter, pulled pork was yummy, as were the ribs!  Huge portions.
It was a Sunday afternoon, and when we left there at 4, they were out of Turkey and ribs. So heads up!
Our server Hannah was spot on, charming and witty.
Will be going back. Worth the drive."}
{"text":"Excellent meal here. En route from Puerto Rico to Virginia we stopped here for dinner (probably not a good plan before a 5 hour drive - HUGE portions). My husband and I split the 4 choice bbq combo, we had brisket, wings with dragon sauce, pulled pork, and dry rubbed ribs with fried okra, mac & cheese, & collard greens. The wings & brisket were our favorites. The Mac & cheese was a little dry & the ribs could have done with a bit more flavor but overall it was really good & far too much food for 2 people!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Such big portions for your money. I love the bbq chicken, sweet potato casserole, mac n cheese. I also love the pickled onions and pickles."}
{"text":"Pretty much my favorite bbq place. Place is packed most of the time. I usually get the pulled pork and ribs or wings but I've tried it all and it's all fantastic. You have to ask for the Alabama bbq sauce if you didn't order a chicken dish- good stuff. The tea is off the hook too."}
{"text":"This place is worth the drive. You will not go home hungry. The potato salad is better than I make at home. The red cole slaw was a nice surprise!"}
{"text":"Huge portions.. and the best smoked meat around."}
{"text":"OFF THE CHAIN!!!! Wow best overall BBQ joint I've ever eaten at!!!  Did I say off the chain!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best bbq restaurants I've been to in a very long time! Everything from the wings to mac & cheese to sweet potato fries were absolutely delicious! I plan on visiting soon to try the brisket!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are visiting friends in Huntersville and are on a mission to eat as much BBQ as possible. Based off of the reviews I was super excited. A little sad about there not being any ribs, however I was prepared that they may be. 
The line was long but to be expected
The cashiers both expressed how tired they were and seemed to use that excuse for there not as cheery demeanor
BEST of all the food did NOT disappoint 
My first bite of corn bread was not anything special however the crispy top layer is the bees knees!
The amount of food you get also does not disappoint  (breakfast  in the AM)

When we visit again this will for sure be a must stop"}
{"text":"By far the best BBQ in the Charlotte area! Hubs had brisket, chicken, pork & ribs with sides green, beans and corn bread - I had pulled pork, slaw and mac/cheese ... I think there was 10lbs of food between the two of us! The meat, hands down, can not be touched by other \"smokers\" in the Charlotte area - so tender, so flavorful and even though their sauce is fantastic, who needs it! Absolutely amazing! Sides are fantastic as well, but the thing that caused the biggest fight...me stealing the old mans corn bread ;) phenomenal! While we waited for our literal TRAYS of food to be delivered we were in awe of the details they put into to designing the place - the artwork is gorgeous and I absolutely loved the thoughtful touches of the table clothes and paper towel holders with lil animals on them, you can see how much love went into this place before you even take your first bite...once that happens though, you'll never be the same and will never experience food like this anywhere else! To make this a \"full\" review I've got to mention how awesome the staff is on top of it - the two waitresses that we encountered were so pleasant, knowledgeable and were just \"on it\" when we needed anything.  When placing our order we didn't realize the (panthers hat) taking our order was a manager until he came to our table to check and see how we were doing (how often do you get that these days) - sadly I didn't get his name, but it doesn't matter everyone there was amazing. His sense of humor and pure interest in making our experience pleasant was impressive. I thought we were getting \"special treatment\" since we had this little football banter going on, but nope, just like any good manager should, he went right to the next table, then the next, then the next. Concord should be honored that such an outstanding business has moved into town - not only do these folks have the mood and food right, they've got the customer service make most places fail. Keep up the OUTSTANDING job Smoke Pit peeps - you're doing it RIGHT!!!!"}
{"text":"We went here for lunch today. Really, there's not much to say other than, BBQ doesn't get much better than this. 

I tried...
The sausage, which was very good, but I've had better.

Cornbread, good, but a little dry, but then again isn't cornbread dry almost always?

Beef brisket- nice smokey flavor, very tender

Baked beans- some of the best I've ever had!

Pulled chicken- AWESOME smokey flavor! I felt like I was on a camping trip for a minute.

Fried okra- better than Cracker Barrel's. They were cooked nice and soft.

Greens- very flavorful, cooked with some kind of ham/pork. It's what you should expect from a BBQ restaurant.

Mac and Cheese- sticky and thick with chunks of cheese from the top mixed in throughout. Excellent choice for a side dish. 

If you like BBQ, this place is a MUST. If you don't care for BBQ, try this place anyway, it's good enough to make you change your mind."}
{"text":"They catered my wedding! The food was delicious! Broccoli casserole is my favorite! They also have great tacos if you get in on the right day!"}
{"text":"I originally tried their food at Cabarrus Brewing Company over the weekend. While the nachos and wings were fantastic, I knew I couldn't gauge how great it truly was without going to the restaurant. What a decision that was!

My girlfriend and I split the Pick 3 meats combo, we went with the bbq pork, leg quarters, and ribs, with mac & cheese and collard greens for sides. Naively, we also got a side of fried okra just in case it wasn't enough food. That was my favorite mistake of the day, it was way more than enough! Everything was amazing, all the meat was tender and moist and the sides were carefully crafted and delicious. I am a huge bbq fan, and this is the best I've ever had. Better yet, there was so much food that I'm having the leftover for lunch tomorrow. Oh, happy days!"}
{"text":"A little expensive put the portions were fair for the price. It was good food and I would definitely recommend it - especially if you are passing through the area like we were. Very popular place (based on the line that seemed to be replenished with new patrons about every 10 minutes), good and fast service but it's not the best BBQ I've ever had fircthat price."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. We've never gone and there hasn't been a line so that should tell you its the place to go for good BBQ - big portions, great food. Not a big fan of the collard greens since they're pretty spicy without much flavor. Their fries and sweet potato fries aren't fresh cut so I'd go with any of the other house made sides if I were you. If they are serving the sweet potato casserole as their casserole of the day, GET IT! So good and seems to have praline pecans mixed in it. My other favorite is the deviled egg potato salad.

My husband ordered the Stock Market sandwich which had pulled pork, smoked sausage, and brisket which was the biggest sandwich I've ever seen. He's a big guy and had to eat it in two sessions. Worth the $10-15 price point."}
{"text":"Some of the best bbq I have ever had! We love ordering take out simply because it's always so busy!"}
{"text":"Where to begin... The only downfall to this place is the long line to get in. The brisket I got was phenomenal, my wife got the pulled pork which was very good as well. The portions were amazing, but the sides are to die for! The cornbread was so good, the baked mac and cheese was terrific, but my favorite was the sweet potato casserole, So delicious!"}
{"text":"I'm a bit of a bbq snob. I know I know what does a boy from NY know about BBQ. A lot! 
This has been by far the best BBQ I've had. The brisket what super tender and juicy. Pork was perfect and the ribs were amazing. I highly highly recommend The Smoke Pit. I will be back."}
{"text":"Excellent barbecue! I had the brisket potato and my honey had the barbecue plate. Both cuts of meat were delectable. Sauces complimented the meal perfectly. You must try!  Next time we will split a plate because there was a lot of food."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Great service. Getting into the place and seating could use a bit of improvement.

The line snaked from around the outside of the building to inside, down to the register where orders are taken. As someone previously stated, the line moved pretty fast. 

This situation needs help. It's hard to get out of the place when everyone in line is blocking all access doors. The line also goes past two tables that sit at the wall that divides part of the seating area from the aisle where the line runs. 

It would be nice for those seated/eating at those two tables if there were a higher partition that blocks those in line from leaning almost right into the meals of those eating at those tables.

Even if food hasn't arrived at the table yet, the people in the line are almost talking right in the face of who ever is seated at those tables. In the case of children who haven't been trained well and/or whose parents don't know enough -- or don't care enough -- to tell them not to, they might be literally in the face or meal of those sitting at the table, as the wall is just high enough for children of a certain height to lean on/over said wall.

Not sure if they've ever done it but one possible solution is to use the door closest to the registers as the entry point. It would mean a longer wait outside but it would be less chaotic for those trying to leave the place. It would also offer more \"privacy\" for those sitting at the tables mentioned above.

The food arrives on a try covered with a thin piece of paper that resembles butcher's paper. Only I'm not sure that it IS butcher's paper because it has a reddish tint to it and the consistency of a strong paper towel. (Meaning it held up pretty well under the \"strain\" of whatever juice and grease seeped into it from my meat and cornbread.) 

My meal: smoked pork BBQ with mac and cheese, collards, corn bread, and sweet tea. Portion size was \"just enough\". A little more than some places I've eaten but not excessively so.

The meat was tender. Delicious with the vinegar sauce. The greens were good. Cornbread was good but I didn't like the actual corn baked into it. (Next time I'll try the Texas Toast.) The mac and cheese was okay. I would have liked lemon for my tea but didn't see any and didn't ask.

The lady who took my order was pleasant and personable as was the young lady who gave me a refill on my sauce.

There is a roll of strong brown paper towels on each table. Good idea cause we all know how messy BBQ can be. An even better idea would be wet wipes of some sort.

Overall, I enjoyed my meal. I'll go again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Delicious each time I've gone. The place always has alone but it moves quickly. The burnt ends are delicious and I Also like their collard greens- a little spicy but delicious."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  We love good food but I don't eat large portions.  In my opinion the portions were very large.  My wife and I shared a 3 meat platter (Brisket, Chicken Quarters and Wings) and we still took food to go. The Brisket was a bit dry for my taste but the sauces on the table did the job.  The Wings with the Honey BBQ sauce were on point...  I will come back if I'm ever in town."}
{"text":"This place is by far the best bbq I have tasted in NC! We drive about 30min from our town of mooresville just to eat here. The food is outstanding, huge portions, awesome prices, nice atmosphere. We totally need one of these in mooresville because the bbq here does not even do this place justice. My husband was born and raised in Texas and agrees this place is the best!!"}
{"text":"Eaten a lot of BBQ in my day, and this place may just top it all. Shared a pulled pork plate with my main squeeze. The meat was perfect, didn't even need sauce, but the sauce was good so I  was dipping into it. We also got the fried okra and mac and cheese. Okra was real good, mac and cheese wasn't anything exceptional but all mac and cheese is good mac and cheese in my opinion. A couple of pickles on the side which were great with the pork. 

We also impulse ordered some wings at the last minute. Boy am I glad we did. When they say jumbo they are not messing around. Giant wings (both parts of the wing) and both the dragon sauce and homemade ranch are to die for. 

The portions were huge (did not keep us from cleaning the trays though) and I felt like it was a great value for the money. Only downside is the line gets longgggg. Worth the wait for sure, but you need to leave yourself some time before eating here."}
{"text":"I knew nothing about TSP prior to visiting, A couple friends and I had met up at a local brewing company and talked about what to do for grub. One of those aforementioned friends was a local and this joint was his suggestion. Not knowing that they closed so early on Saturday, we barely made it in to order before they locked the doors from the inside. We waited in quite the line along the front window and out into the lobby area.

That long line gave me plenty of time to search the menu and change my mind multiple times. They also had a list of the stuff they had already ran out of, that seemed like it was a common occurrence later in the evenings. Definitely a good sign.

You will not leave hungry - I guess unless you're taking your food to-go. But, seriously, they make sure to give you a large amount of meat to go with your sides as well as your choice of bread.

I went with pulled pork, a simple option indeed as well as the collard greens, mac n cheese and cornbread. The pork was a little dried out in some spots, but still flavorful. The sides hit the spot, too!

If I'm in the area I would definitely consider TSP an option."}
{"text":"Burnt ends.... cornbread... to quote the guy in front of us in line...\"This place is crushing it\"  Great BBQ... locally owned... worth the wait!!!"}
{"text":"Best Bbq this side of my mom's old kitchen and BBQ SLAB in Alabama friendly staff so clean great atmosphere"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice and tried to eat here two additional times but they were out of food. It was only 630. I understand running out of something every now and then but not everything all the time. When they have food the meat is very good but the sides leave a lot to be desired. The mac and cheese is dry, the sweet potato fries are frozen waffle fries, and the red slaw is bland. The baked beans however are great and I'd come for the meat, beans, and delicious pickles that come with every plate. That is if they ever had any. If you want to give the food a try you should probably go for lunch."}
{"text":"Stopped here while over nighted in concord, well worth the stop. I eat bbq across the country and this was right up there with the best. Got there just before closing and unfortunately they ran out of ribs. Went for the brisket and pulled pork. Brisket was excellent and that comes from 7 years of eating Texas bbq. Pulled pork was also good.  My coworkers said chicken was awesome. All the sides were good. I would say come hungry as the portions are huge. Since we got there at closing they started handing out excess free cherry cobbler which they make fresh, it was very good.  Made up for no ribs which I will come back to try someday."}
{"text":"Had great ratings, so I decided to try it. Went at a later time wasn't packed but 65% of the tables were occupied. I had the choose three and got them dry I got brisket, ribs and pulled pork comes with 2 sides I had mac n cheese and collards. The ribs were a little under done but good, probably could have gone another 30 minutes in the smoker. Pulled pork was on point but did have a little bit of the vinegar based sauce on it. The brisket was over done, but had great flavor. I will be back to try other items on the menu.."}
{"text":"A full blown 5-star Yelp experience. If you are within an hour of this place, make the drive."}
{"text":"Oh my, for our first time visiting, I will definitely be back many more times. As close as it is to home and I never knew of this place is ridiculous. I've been missing out this whole time. The wing and ribs \"wet\" are to freaking die for. The brisket was very tasty, a little too dry, but we very good. Service is excellent. The line was out the door even after we sat down, but it was definitely worth the wait. A+ for me!"}
{"text":"I've worked in 2 award winning BBQ restaurants and could never find good BBQ while visiting Concord and Mooresville. This place is THAT place. Everything was authentic and delicious. Moreover, the staff was so friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent wings, blue cheese dressing, fries... picked this place randomly without looking at reviews. Lucked out."}
{"text":"I have gone 3x and tried ribs, brisket , pulled pork and burnt ends. Very tasty and quick service and always leave full! and happy"}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've had in NC!  Excellent flavor and huge servings so come hungry.  Cozy home style restaurant great for families with small children. Very popular with locals so if don't want to wait go early."}
{"text":"I enjoy the food. But last time I came in it was NOT this expensive. $15 for some Brisket and one side is kind of ridiculous. It used to be like $11 or 12 for Brisket with TWO sides. I didn't mind paying that for a good meal, but now it just seems they are ripping people off."}
{"text":"Best BBQ we've had in a long time!! It was recommended to us by a friend & we were traveling through the area, so we stopped ... wow ... so glad we did!!! Delicious!!! Best brisket we've ever had."}
{"text":"Super cute and casual. First time eating there, usually go to buy meat on the store side. Place order up front, then find a table and wait. Pulled pork was Amazing! Large portions and all the sides were sooo delicious! Ribs were juicy and the cornbread was huge and great. Get a lot of bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"This is a GO TO place to eat!!  I've eaten BBQ all over the US and this ranks near, if not at the top. Everything is great with HUGE portions!!!  Here is how I rank the proteins.  
Brisket 
Wings
Ribs
Pork
Chicken
But it is all good with incredible service.  Be prepared to wait as it's always crowded!!!  The word is out on this place!!!"}
{"text":"We consider ourselves bbq junkies coming from Texas.  Tonight we tried this place and we were very impressed. The unsweetened ice tea was good enough to drink with no added sweetener. The brisket was moist and tender. Smoked chicken had great flavor. Fried okra and sweet potato tots were perfect sides. All in, we'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"What can i say that hasn't been said?! Amazing barbecue! Everything is good! You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Best bbq in the charlotte area hands down. if I lived closer I would eat here 5 times a week. The pork is perfect the only side I've tried is the mac and cheese and it's great. Every meat on the menu is smoked to perfection."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't been here before.. best burnt ends, and BBQ I've ever had... and I run restaurants for a living! Every side item, mac n cheese, green bean casserole, Cole slaw were made to simple perfection and with southern love. Great friendly staff was rocking a busy Tuesday(!) dinner rush smiling the whole time. Keep it up and you are now my only BBQ spot!"}
{"text":"I will first start off by saying I give it 4 stars because I found the brisket spud a tad spicy but I'm a baby when it comes to spicy. I'm not sure if the brisket was supposed to have a lot of fat on it but felt like pieces in my potato had more fat than usual. I would only recommend that they let guests have the option to put on their own sauce on the spud other than that it was excellent. Kinda reminded me of Texas BBQ which is hard to duplicate. Very good portions for the price you pay. VERY busy place even for lunch on a Saturday. The line was out the door and took about 10-15min to get through it. The place, of course was packed and very rambunctious, in other words loud. Parking may be difficult if the restaurant is busy /packed. They also had a country store to the side where you could buy sauce or beef to cook your own."}
{"text":"The corn bread was excellent. I love that they hadb pulled chicken. I like pork and beef ok but I prefer chicken it was good without being dry. Did I mention the cornbread? The sides were good. Mac and cheese was not the best I've ever had but good. The check out staff was quick and friendly. I will be back."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely amazing. They let us try samples and I eventually decided to get the burnt ends and Cajun turkey. I couldn't have made a better choice. The food was plentiful, good portion sizes. My sides were Mac and cheese and greens. If I lived closer this would be on my go to list."}
{"text":"A co-worker and I were traveling in Monroe on a business trip and we saw this place and thought it would be a good place to try. The food was absolutely delicious and you definitely got your money's worth in terms of quantity of food. We all went home with leftovers. I had the ribs, baked beans, deviled egg potato salad and cornbread and none of them disappointed. I definitely couldn't finish everything on my plate, but I made sure to take that cornbread home because it was too good to leave behind! My co-worker had the brisket sandwhich and thoroughly enjoyed it even though she had to eat it with a fork because there was so much meat on the sandwich that it couldn't be picked up without making a mess all over the place. My only minor complaint would be that the fried pickles did seem to be a bit salty, but I will most likely order them again if we end up back here"}
{"text":"I must say. The Smoke Pit gives you a ton of food for a great price. I ordered the Stock Market sandwich and my jaw hit the floor when the waitress brought out this monster-size sandwich. It was freaking H-U-G-E.

3 types of meat on this bad boy: Brisket, Sausage and Pulled Pork with barbecue sauce and jalapenos. This sandwich was humongous. Look at the picture I posted for reference. Also their bbq baked beans are awesome as well. 

I am a fan and will definately be a returning customer. Bring your appetite because they pile the meat on all their sandwhiches."}
{"text":"This place is always packed and seating is hard to come by.   Luckily there is patio seating if the weather cooperates.  

We ordered a pulled pork plate and pulled pork sandwich.  Each item came with sides.  The sides were baked beans, mac n cheese and fried okra.  The only complaint was the okra.  Very greasy to where it was dripping off the okra.   I was unable to eat it all due to that.  The mac n cheese was thick and cheesy and very filling.  The baked beans had a large chunk of meat in it.  Not sure if was supposed to be in there.  Either way it was eaten. 

One complaint...asked for a lid to a sauce cup that I made.  Girl at the front counter then put the cup to her nose and sniffed it.   Then she asked what sauce it was.  After doing that I told her I no longer wanted the sauce she just sniffed.  She said she was going to get a new one anyway.  She came back with four new sauces.  

Also this place asks for tips when you order and pay before sitting down.  They are a self service restaurant.  You get everything on your own and you can throw your own garbage away.   If not, you can leave it on the table and someone will clean it.  

During this, not one person checked on us so no tip was left.  We took care of our own table.  I don't know how you can tip on service that wasn't received yet."}
{"text":"Excellent food and HUGE portions. Definitely try the burnt ends. You must check this place out!!"}
{"text":"We have always enjoyed our food and service at The Smoke Pit however today was not one of those days. I actually had live bugs in my bque salad. That's right....LIVE tiny green and black lettuce bugs. The manager after presenting my 1/4 eaten salad stated, \"that's what happens when they don't wash the lettuce well.\"

Did you wash the lettuce?

The best part of the whole thing was I got my salad taken off the bill ( they still got my money for the drinks and tip that I always leave when ordering )   I was graciously given a $20 credit to come back and try their food again.

I'm honestly not one to complain so I just smiled and said thank you. The right thing to do would have been to comp our entire check along with returning the tip money paid. Needless to say my family was also disgusted and barely finished their meals. I'm totally disappointed and disgusted. Saddest part is that I have supported their restaurant and shared the info with others. Not anymore. Thanks but no thanks Smoke Pit!"}
{"text":"What a great joint for some North Carolina BBQ. I ordered a pound of brisket and half a rack of ribs and they were great. The ribs were tender, smoky and perfectly spiced. The brisket for me was a little dry but overall delicious. The meal comes with 2 generous sides and corn bread. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The few times in a person's life that we often give a five star review. The smoke pit on a Tuesday night is on like popcorn the food was tasty, well cooked the portions we're quite generous. No make that an nice!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've ever had. Brisket burnt ends, whole chicken wings, ribs, mac & cheese and sweet potato casserole. It was all so delicious and definitely will be going back and bringing friends."}
{"text":"So my besty is a BBQ snop and I being a midwest girl have a different stand on the Southern Q. However, this place is legit. Midwest flavors, Texas sized portions and Southern sized charm. I loved the brisket beans, okra, and mounds of meat. Its worth a PIT stop.

Eh, see what I did there..."}
{"text":"One word. MEAT. Where else can you go and get a plate of straight meat, mac and cheese, and a side. The tea is amazing but you may have to wait in line but one bite of the BBQ makes it worthwhile."}
{"text":"I recently moved to Concord and have driven past this place several times.  This past weekend my aunt and uncle were in town so we decided to go for lunch before they flew home.  It was SO GOOD.  My aunt and I both ordered the Blue Chicken Salad which ended up being huge and we should have split, but it was YUMMY, so I'm happy to eat the leftovers.  The chicken with the blueberry syrup sauce was delicious and neither of us used any dressing because the sauce was so good.  The salad also had huge blueberries in it! My uncle got the pulled chicken sandwich and was more than happy with it as we sampled the different sauces on the table.  We will definitely be back the next time they are in town.  Plus as a little bonus, they have a meat shop in the same building and a beautiful patio out front."}
{"text":"Excellent food they know meat and they are nice and friendly eat in or take out both excellent its popular for many reasons"}
{"text":"This place is to die for. If you like bbq and southern food, this is the place for you. Great brisket, fried okra, and French fries. The seasoning is flavorful!"}
{"text":"Living up in New Jersey, good BBQ is hard to find, and when I came down to Charlotte to visit my Dad he had one suggestion for BBQ. That being \"The Smoke Pit\". After reading reviews, and hearing my Dad rave about this place, my GF and I made plans to get there shortly after opening because it sounded like it could easily become a madhouse.

I went in knowing I wanted the 3 meat platter, but my GF was vastly undecided, that was until she saw the special menu board and saw the Smoked Turkey Stuffed Tater with Alabama White Sauce, Bacon, and Cheese.

We ended up with that tater and a 3 meat platter that had Pulled Pork (A MOUNTAIN OF PORKY GOODNESS), Smoked Sausage, and the Brisket. For my sides I picked the mac&cheese and their french fries. It also was served along a MASSIVE CUBE of Cornbread, pickles, and some slaw. The slaw wasn't my favorite, but then again I prefer a creamy coleslaw versus a vinegary one. 

All I can say is that everything on this tray was absolutely delicious. The meats can all stand on their own, but they also included a golden mustard BBQ sauce which was indescribably good. It didn't overwhelm anything, but it somehow intensified everything else. 

The french fries had a great seasoning on them, they were much thicker than a shoestring fry, but not as hefty as a steak cut. 

My GF was pleasantly surprised when the lady at the counter told her the tater comes with a side salad, but she could swap it out for any side. Well, if you're going all in with comfort food might as well get a side of mac&cheese to go along with a stuffed tater.

For the two of us it was near 40 bucks, which might seem like a lot, but we both easily got 2 meals a piece out of this, and we didn't feel anything wasn't worth it. We long for the next opportunity we have to make the 600 mile trek down to devour this delicious BBQ"}
{"text":"Great food and nice portions! Their sweet sauce on the ribs is amazing and I tried their vinegar based that my wife had with her BBQ and it was pretty good with a nice kick.  

You pay when your order and I don't care for being asked to tip before service so removed a star for that .  After you order the wait staff checks on you for.refills and to see if you want any other sauces, and they are very friendly and you can just leave a tip on the table.  

Very casual atmosphere and the wait for food was not long at all."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times for lunch and it is delicious! Service is fast and they bring plenty of food for you to enjoy!! Always brining home leftovers!! 
Oh, banana pudding was AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"Incredible. Burnt ends, BBQ beans, pulled pork sandwich. So tender, flavorful. I visit the Charlotte area once a year and I will make sure The Smoke Pit is my first destination."}
{"text":"Whoa! Where has this place been on my foodie-detecter? This is it... The official BBQ palace of NC.... hands down this is the best BBQ that I've had thus far! I'm soooooooo full right now I'm having a difficult time writing this review! So my husband and I ordered the pick 2 combo: Brisket, Wings, with a side of mac & cheese, okra and added a side of potato salad! We decided on the way up to The Smoke Pitt to share a plate because of pictures from other reviews. We ate, and ate, and ate, and we still had plenty of leftovers to take home. The brisket was so succulent and tender, OMG... if you tried picking it up with a fork it would just fall apart and off the fork. The wings were huge and normally I run from big chicken wings, but these wings were expertly smoked and topped with a spicy/sweet sauce (dragon sauce). The sides were well seasoned and traditionally southern, from the crispy okra to the olde school mac&cheese to the eggs in the potato salad as if granny made it. This place is where it's at... come hungry! I'm coming for that fully loaded brisket potato next time! The ONLY reason I didn't give them five stars is because the cushions in the booths need to be replaced, they've been taped down with duct tape and uncomfortable to sit on without getting your legs scratched. But the FOOD is five stars for sure!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best BBQ restaurant that I've tried in the northern Charlotte Metro area. But with that said there's room for improvement to make it stellar. 

Service. 2 stars. 

Very slow. At first I thought the line out the door was due to an overwhelming response to the place just being absolutely fantastic. But it came apparent after 45 minutes of standing in line that proficiency and efficiency is where they are dropping the ball. They have a very small dining room but at any given time there was 5-6 open tables. So the problem starts at the front. The cashier/order taker was very slow. Unsure on how to use the point of sales that it seemed. Once we ordered and proceeded to sit down, I had to clean our table. Removing everything.  In the staffs defense, most people clean their tables off as its customary with refuse canisters in the dining room. But with that said, the table sat dirty among with several others for over 10 minutes while we were in line. 

Food. 3.5 stars

I ordered their Pick 4 meats combo for $21.99. When this tray of gluttony hits the table it is impressive looking.   Mounds of swine, beef and poultry all heaped on. 

Beef Brisket 3 stars. 

I think they use a 2 piece cut of brisket. Meaning that it's two muscles joined with a fat cap and a centerline of fat in the middle. At first glance, it's an astonishing feat of smoked genus. Smelled great too. But when you look closer you can tell that they nearly left the whole fat cap on straight out of the package. Now there's a debate in the \"smoke\" world on how much fat to leave on but this was obsessive. It had a nice smoke ring but it didn't penetrate the meat. The fat was the recipient of that great flavor enhancement. If I had to guess. They sent out probably 8 oz of brisket. But after trimming the inedible fat off. I was left with about 4 oz.  I have to say. That 4 oz was pretty good. Nice texture. Little thicker than I prefer.  Moist and a moderate amount of smoke, which would've been more if they trimmed it a little leaner.  The sauce they had to accompany the brisket was their take on a thicker Kansas style sauce. Sweet and thick but pretty good with the pairing. 

Pulled Pork 4 stars. 

Little different than the traditional presentation of the other Carolina style Q restaurants in the area but pretty damn good. Nice chunky pulls instead of the minced pork you'll find down the street. The only negatives I had about this was the sauce they had which was a Carolina style vinegar \"mop\" and that the meat wasn't as clean as I'd like to see. Tons of chunks of slimy fat that was beautifully caramelized but inedible. 

Smoked \"Sweet\" Wings 4 stars

Nice huge uncut wings (meaning the flats and the drums are attached). Very surprisingly one of the best parts of the meal. Nice smoke flavor. Perfect texture and not overdone. I think they used a garlic rub while smoking. The sweet glaze was really good. 

Smoke sausage 4 stars

Generous portion. Pre cut instead of a link. Nice smokey flavor. I probably could eat a plate of these by themselves. 

Collard Greens 2 stars

Being a southern boy. You can't pull sub par greens on me. Blessed with an adoptive grandma of a different race and my own biological one. The benchmark is set high for this item. They were extremely bitter. Undercooked. Tons of stalk left on. Poor attempt of adding some sort of fat while cooking. They gave a generous portion but who wants to eat a lot of something that tastes so bad. 

Sweet Potato Casserole 4 stars

Decent. Little runny but had a great flavor. 


CLEANLINESS 3.5 stars. Bathroom was clean. The counter and kitchen area looked clean. Where they lose stars is in the dining area. The tables would sit for long periods of time with no attention.  Front self service trashcan was overflowing. 


I hope you find this review useful. I will try again. But will only go when there's not a line out the door. Already made that mistake once."}
{"text":"Place is off the chain, on the money...dang. This is the only barbecue place I come and order the chicken, it's that good. Also if you go at peak times, you will wait in a crazy long line just to order food, but realize it's worth it, long line for a reason. Waitresses have been hit or miss. Only legit place in Concord to eat in my book."}
{"text":"This hidden jewel in Concord hit the spot. The amount of food for the buck is unreal. My awesome experience started with Jackie at the counter- she was polite and intuitive !!!! I couldn't decide on which meat so I opted for the four meat option...it was enough food for three people. The brisket was amazing balls...the rib was smoked to perfection...the pulled pork was moist and last but not least the smoke wings were perfect. The sides didn't really move me but they didn't lose me either. Yes! I saved room for dessert the peach cobbler was Amazing!!!! I will be returning with my entire staff !"}
{"text":"Late lunch on Friday 
Good food and service
Also beer liquor and margaritas available 
$4.00 jack daniels"}
{"text":"Had to stop by this BBQ place while visiting family in NC from NY. From the second my boyfriend and I walked in we were greeted by the staff and they were beyond sweet and helpful since they knew it was our first time. We both ended up getting the BBQ combos and once it came out to the table I was shocked in how much food they give you. I didn't even know where to started I kept going from the pulled pork to the chicken wings to the macaroni and cheese and then to the corn bread. everything was beyond delicious and the manager made sure she came over to ask how we were enjoying our meals which was much appreciated. This was hands down the best BBQ/eating experience I've ever had. We will definitely be coming back to the smoke pit when we visit again, it is 110% worth it."}
{"text":"This is BY FAR the  BEST BBQ I've ever had!! Portions are huge and definitely worth the money!"}
{"text":"Great food, huge portions.  We could've shared a two 2 meat platters between the 4 of us.  The brisket was great and I loved the burnt ends, but honestly the star of the plate was the pulled pork.  Deliciously tender and juicy.   The fries and beans were delicious, and there's a teeny kick to the beans!  My husband devoured their new 'street corn' which also had a spice to it, but was reallllly good.   Only miss on the plate was the over cooked fried okra.  But there was plenty more yumminess to make up for that.  

The people that walked around checking on us were super friendly and helpful.  They made sure we had our to go boxes ready.   We actually walked in to the attached market and bought bread to eat with our leftovers, which was super convenient!  
Wish we had room to try the banana pudding- we were just too full."}
{"text":"What on earth is this smoke pit doing here? This place belongs on the cover of some BBQ America Magazine or in the center of Charlotte, NC or something. Incredibly impressive spread of perfectly smoked BBQ meats. The brisket is in my top 5 in the U.S.A. and the wings are by far the best BBQ Smoked Wings I've had in my life. I didn't even know wings could taste like this. All of their sides are good, I personally prefer the vinegar based slaw (no mayo) and the mac & cheese. I've been to BBQ spots all over the country, and this smoke pit belongs in my top 5. I'm almost glad they are no where near me, because if I lived near here I'd be in line every day. Oh yeah, and warning the line is serious - get here early"}
{"text":"You don't need a lot of words for this place except for fabulous, fantastic, addictive, phenomenal, just dang good. They have pulled pork, hot links, ribs, chicken, chicken wings...I'm working my way through the menu. You must get the chopped brisket sandwich with cole slaw, baked beans, and mac-n-cheese. The deviled egg potato salad is good...could be better. The collard greens melt in your mouth. Don't forget the sweet tea. Did I mention the bbq sauces (choice of 2) are beyond the moon good? The place STAYS PACKED. Best thing to do is call ahead and place a to-go order, otherwise you risk the chance of you favorites selling out because they will sell out. You can walk right up to the counter, pay for your order and enjoy lip smacking bbq in the comforts of your home in front of the TV in your barker lounger and fuzzy slippers This place is the truth!!!!"}
{"text":"Banging. This food was banging. 

If I wasn't so hungry when it showed up in front of me, you'd see a pulled pork sandwich. Imagine it. Pork piled sky high topped with 4 yummy pickles and a top bun slightly askew. The fries: not quite steak thick, but not shoestring thin. Sprinkled with some sort of heavenly dust of a seasoning. 

The service was decent, but my companion's meal took about 10 or so minutes after mine came to arrive. I'm not sure if it's because she ordered the brisket (which was slamming, in my opinion. She said it was a little salty on the end, but I loved that. The ends were good and crisp, too.) I wanted to tear right into mine, but I waited for her. So I stared at it longingly. And still forgot to take a photo because my mouth was dang near watering. My food was still plenty warm, though.

Tip: The sauces are good, but not labeled. The one you can see the seeds in is vinegar based. Pour accordingly or you might end up with a drowned plate. lol"}
{"text":"Shout out to the girls working the drive thru on Father's Day!!! I can't thank them enough for taking care of me!!
Awesome place to dine and relax! 
Customer service is amazing!!! Thank you To the Smoke Pit employees!!"}
{"text":"We love this place! The food is awesome, best BBQ in the Charlotte area. We've been here 3 times in 3 weeks! Food is consistent. Service is good. 
The pulled pork is not overly dry or fatty. Very flavorful. The smoked wings have amazing flavor but can dry out a bit if you get them to-go. 
2 of the sauces offered are sweet with little to no heat, then there's a very hot vinegar sauce, and a sweet and (very) spicey dragon sauce.
The sides are awesome, big thick cut fries, better than homemade mac& cheese, awesome super bacony baked beans, fried okra done just right. And the pickles! YUM! The cornbread is killer- it's basically a giant hunk of corn cake. 
This place can get really busy and seating is a little limited. No holding tables and if there aren't tables open they stop taking orders until you can be seated. Space usually opens up quickly."}
{"text":"Wow! What an awesome find.

I've tried a lot of BBQ throughout the South, and the Smoke Pit ranks among the most impressive places I've tried.

My girlfriend and I ordered a combo plate with pork, brisket, and sausage with sides of baked beans, Mac and cheese, and corn bread.

Pork was pulled, moist and tender, well seasoned and had good flavor. The brisket was EXCELLENT and was cooked perfectly, from the fatty portion of the brisket. They described it as Texas-style and it certainly was. The sausage was sliced and flavored similar to Italian style flavor (but of course smoked). Beans and Mac n cheese were both good, especially beans. Mac n cheese is a \"dry\" type baked Mac n cheese, different from the creamy sort but still good. We loved the corn bread! Was just sweet enough with small pieces of corn in it, yum. They also had 4 kinds of bbq sauce, meal was served with a terrific mustard-based one on the side, while the table had 3 other styles including a Lexington/vinegar based type. All the sauces were quite good too.

Interior was clean and friendly service too. 5 star quality bbq!"}
{"text":"You guys are a great addition to the Monroe area! Came here for a birthday lunch and overall it was great! Our server was really nice and even though it was busy was super attentive. Disappointed that I couldn't have a beer but hey, new places have to endure for a while I suppose.

I had the pick two brisket and ribs

Brisket - nice smoky flavour nice sauce, unfortunately was a little dry but it tastes great so I overlooked that (something to watch in future)

Ribs - awesome - fall off the bone, nice flavour, nice sauce - great, no complaints at all!

Sweet tots are awesome because they're hard to find! Enjoyed them

Mac m cheese was pretty good - maybe try a crunchy topping?

All in all this was a great meal and you get a heck of a lot for your money compared to other restaurants! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"T h e barbecue at the smile it it finger-locking good! The burnt ends are my favorite, they bare tender and just dripping with that amazing sauce... Now the sides are out of this world, the last time I went there I was considering trying to sneak a  peak in the kitchen to see if my mama was back there giving out the secret family recipes!

The lines and the wait time for your order is sometimes long but its worth the wait! 
Great alternative to home cooking!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing, you might have to wait, but boy is it worth the experience! Try the pulled pork and wet ribs! It's priced the same as most BBQ joints and it's well deserved! A+ BBQ joint!"}
{"text":"Great brisket! Baked beans were amazing! Hubby had s bbq'ing Buffaloe salad, and it was good....the cornbread was delicious! This is a must try in Concord."}
{"text":"OMG!!! This place is bbq heaven. The BBQ pork and smoked wings (no sauce) are fantastic. The brisket is lean but a little dry...still good but not the best. Hands down one of my favorite BBQ places in NC."}
{"text":"So glad I found this place. The wait was definitely worth it  because the food was great. Loved the staff, small hidden location but don't let it fool you because it's all worth it. Top Notched on everything. I got the BBQ combo with ribs, brisket, potato salad, and fried okra. It was more than enough and could definitely feed 2 person."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here. Everything I ordered was really delicious and they give you nice large portions . If you are going at lunch I suggest you get there before 12, as it gets really busy. I would definitely recommend this place for great bbq!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!!! We had a big group from Colorado out for the Queen's Cup Steeplechase..The manager, Ivy and her staff were amazing! They were super helpful in putting together our menu and making sure we had everything we needed. The food was outstanding! We highly recommend this place to anyone!!!"}
{"text":"I couldn't believe how much Q they gave you and it was so good.  We had some of everything but the chicken and loved it all, especially the brisket.  The veggies were good too.  The cornbread was sweet and had corn kernels in it and I really liked the collard greens.  Dang, now I'm really hungry."}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've ever had hands down!  Reasonably priced and incredibly tasty food no matter what you order.  The Mac and cheese and fried okra sides are absolutely killer!  BBQ sauces on point as well!  Can't wait to eat here again and again!"}
{"text":"Wow! Skip the chain restaurants and have the Burnt Ends brisket sandwich here. Its sweet, crisp, smoky, and the line is out the door!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this so bad because I was in the mood for BBQ, but was disappointed because everything came out warm/cold instead of piping hot. At first I thought it was just the sweet potato fries since that was the first thing I tried, but it was the same for the ribs along with the mac and cheese hubby had. He also mentioned that he likes his mac and cheese creamy whereas theirs was more dry, so just something to keep in mind depending on your preference. I will say that the food itself was good, but the fact that everything seemed to have been sitting there before it got to us was really disappointing. I could've asked to warm everything up, but I was hungry and wanted to finish my food already. The sweet potato fries were waffle fries that a cinnamon sprinkle on them which I liked. We got the ribs wet and there were also additional BBQ sauces available at the table. I'd be willing to give this place another try and hopefully have a better experience next time."}
{"text":"I know I'm just echoing other reviews before me but I've eaten at the smoke pit numerous times and hands-down the best barbecue I've ever had. If you haven't eaten here now's the time!"}
{"text":"Probably THE best restaurant in Concord! Fantastic bbq, smoked chicken wings, brisket, among other choices. They give you generous portions-my husband and I always share something and still have to bring food home, great atmosphere and fast service. The Smoke Pit is small so you'll have to wait in line to order then get a table, but well worth the wait."}
{"text":"If you like meat... ALOT of meat, then this is your place! My boyfriend loves smoked BBQ and we came here for lunch on a Saturday (they are closed on Sundays). Choice of 3 (about $25) came with 2 sides and there were so much food I think I had enough leftover for 4 more meals. Ribs were good, a little fatty on top (which I like). Pulled pork was the best, so well seasoned you don't really need sauce. The most disappointed item was the brisket - it was so lean and thus dry that it wasn't enjoyable to eat (but my dog definitely enjoyed it - so at least it didn't go to waste). I had the kicking collard greens; it was full of porky flavor and packed just enough of a kick. 
Overall it was a great lunch spot - and you know it's good by the constant line of customers. Remember, you are to line up, order, and receive your # before sitting down at a table. And yes, table spaces are of high demand and low supply. But it wasn't a bad wait for either food or table... be patience, good things come to those who wait!

P.S. Don't forget to poke your head in next door to the meat shop - they have bacon by the slice for $4.99 a pound!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing!!!! There was a really long line so we ordered carryout and ate attend the tables outside. Got the pick three a day got brisket, pulled pork, and burnt ends with Mac and cheese and French fries. Absolutely awesome! They gave us sauce, they have both vinegar and ketchup based barbecue sauces, but the meat was so tender and flavorful that we didn't need them. The brisket was just falling apart and the burnt ends were moist and delicious. I was born and raised on Lexington barbecue and this far exceeds all Lexington barbecue joints!"}
{"text":"The best brisket I have found this side of Texas.  I've been searching for brisket that wasn't over cooked and dry, which all that you can find at most BBQ joints.  Not the case with the Smoke Pit.  I highly recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a great hidden gem!
Went here purely based on Yelp photos and reviews and was not disappointed. The HEEP of food they give you is amazing. I had the brisket, sweet potato casserole, and mac and cheese. I was in heaven!
If I'm ever back in area I will eat here again!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  I'd give it double the stars  if I could. 

I have tried bbq all over....  This was THE BEST I have ever had. 

I highly recommend the wings and the wet ribs."}
{"text":"What an amazing meal!!! We were vacationing at the Great Wolf Lodge and yelp helped us find this little gem. I had the pulled pork sandwich with BBQ beans and potato salad. My husband had the pick three with mac and cheese, greens, corn bread. It was all DELICIOUS. Great service too by Stephanie!! Also got dessert banana pudding great choice as well!! 5 stars"}
{"text":"Small place, get there early. Fantastic ribs, bbq, burnt ends. 
If you are a bbq person this place is a must try. Cannot go wrong anything on the menu."}
{"text":"Slightly pricey but waaaay worth it! Delicious food and lots of leftovers for lunch tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab lunch. Eaten here several times. I get the Stock Market just about every time. It's a sandwich, but I eat it with a fork. Love the sauce. Crowded, but everything moves quick."}
{"text":"The best place to get smoked brisket in the Concord area. Sometimes the line can get long, but dont bail on the place, it moves fairly fast. Everything is good there and its my favorite BBQ in the area."}
{"text":"Good portions and quick service. Mac and cheese was noteworthy and I can't wait to come back when I'm in town next.  I found this place on Yelp and it certainly lived up to its well deserved 4+ star ranking."}
{"text":"Best BBQ around. I've been there 3 times now and they are consistently great. The small pulled pork plate is anybody else's large. The service is fast and friendly. They will soon have craft beer from Southern Range Brewing, so my frequency will continue to increase."}
{"text":"I'm new to area and so when I asked the locals where a good BBQ place was and they all said Smoke Pitt I finally had to try this place. Words can't describe the joy I felt when I took that first bite of their spicy baked beans. I want to say this place was featured on food network a while back. 

When you first walk in you wait in line, you tell the person at the register what you want to order then you grab and # and hopefully can find a table to eat at, then they bring you your food to the table. The portion sizes are huge they are not playing around. I ordered the brisket sandwich it was to die for as well as the sides. 

This is probably the best BBQ food I've ever tried in my life. Even if you don't live in concord, make the trip it's well worth it. There's also a little market attached next door to it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for the first time since I told him I love BBQ and I'd never found a good one that come close to what I had when I live in Austin,TX. As we both do love BBQ! This place was more than good enough. 2nd time here already for my pulled pork salad :)
Quick service and nice atmosphere. Always lucky to come on the right time no long waiting line. They are crazy BUSY as I can tell. Finally I found my spot for BBQ."}
{"text":"This is BBQ perfection pulled pork exquisite brisket is amazing. Then I found out about sweet potato fries in apple butter and heavenly. Best BBQ in Carolina. Just came back for round two and it's even better than I remember. Manager is super nice food is the best I have ever had and banana pudding is out of this world!"}
{"text":"Just go eat there.its good food.huge portions and lots of good choices to be had.the chicken is awesome.and I was blown away that a line was out the door at 4 o'clock in the afternoon!the staff was very friendly even with the busy day they were having.there are a lot of very average BBQ spots in nc.this isn't one of them."}
{"text":"Excellent.  The first thing i should tell you is get there early.  We were lucky.  We arrived at 1125am and walked straight up to order.  Before our food arrived, there was a line to the door.  I had ribs and brisket.  Both were extremely tender and flavorful.  The brisket had great bark and a deep smoke ring.  The sauce was very complex, with tomato and just the right amount of pepper and spices.  Cole slaw is good and mac and cheese was average.  Cornbread is good with soft corn kernels throughout.  Had to get a to go box because it was a lot of food, but probably the most expensive lunch I've ever had at a bbq restaurant."}
{"text":"The line was epic, but once you get your food it makes sense why. I really enjoyed my BBQ combi and will be coming back again really soon! The peach cobbler was also very divine."}
{"text":"This place is legit. No wonder they opened a third location in Monroe. Will def come back for some more grub. We got a full rack of ribs and the burnt ends plate. Meat on the ribs was tender and they had the perfect glaze on them. Sides we tried include: mac n cheese, casserole of the day (which was sweet potato casserole), baked beans, and potato salad and we opted for the cornbread. Then we tried two different desserts which was great as well. Give em a try, you can't go wrong with their bbq. Can't wait to try the other menu options."}
{"text":"This is REAL authentic phenomenal Texas style barbeque!! It was as good as the barbeque we had in Texas. Wow!! We got the four item combo with two orders of burnt ends, brisket, and pulled pork for $27.95. With the two sides and Texas toast, we spent only $30. The food filled up a quarter sheet tray. That was a ton of food for us!! I'm simply in barbeque heaven!!"}
{"text":"I have not tried any of the other items other than the ribs and collards.  They are so so good, my new obsession. I look forward to getting a big plate of ribs once a week! Highly recommend, they are soft and tender, melt in your mouth goodness!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went for the very first time after hearing so many good comments about it .....when we came in the door .....long line and was told that they were out of ribs then after the 45 min. Wait to order .....then we are about orderr they are out of brisket and ribs had to reconstruct our whole order paid and found a table....noticed while we waited for our food to be brought to our table 25 minutes later a group of people that were  behind us got got served  their food  before two other Afro American groups  of 2  and their were 6 of them.. Caucasian..guess?????? what  they ordered? ???????? brisket 
hance my rating.   4 customers lost will never go there again"}
{"text":"Best bbq I've found in this area! The brisket was heavenly. Ribs are amazing. Bbq sweet sauce was great! Mac and cheese delicious. Potato salad was great. Corn bread was to die for. Will most def make this my go to bbq place!"}
{"text":"Solid barbecue sold here. Eastern NC whole hog purists may get all riled up cause the place serves the pork pulled in large pieces with tons of bark vs chopped but damn is it good.  Same goes for the moist brisket and smokey ribs (served wet or dry). 

The line was long when I arrived but moved quickly and the food came out to the table in about 5 minutes. Service was very friendly.  There is a reason this place closes early sometimes cause they run out of meat. It's that good. 

Oh yeah. The butcher shop that is connected is top notch as well."}
