{"text":"I stopped by Noosa this past week and had a great time! The soy salmon was a delicious meal. I sat at the bar because I came in alone so I didn't want to take up a table. After about a minute of me sitting down I realized I made a good choice! The bartenders working were AMAZING! Not only did they give great service they were entertaining and fun to talk to! Both Tiana and Jay or \"T\" and \"J\" ( which is what they told me to call them) addressed me by my first name the entire night instead of \"sir\" or \"Mr\" which gave very friendly vibes. They made sure my drink was always full and that I was satisfied with everything I ordered. I will definitely be back and am sitting at the bar again even if I had other people with me. GREAT FOOD even better service! But like I said I recommend sitting at the bar area and ask for \"T\" and \"J\"!"}
{"text":"I feel like this is the most underrated restaurant in Lake County! 

Every time I've ever been here I've been blown away by the food. Never a long wait on the weekends. One of Mentors best-kept secrets for sure. 

The only kind I have is the place really needs to be remodeled. The Decour is dated and I'm really happy they got rid of the Christmas lights but other than that my favorite place to eat."}
{"text":"My recent experience at Noosa was meh at best.  We ordered and the food was.... ok and the service was.... ok but the price was not indicative of the ambiance.  2 people, an entree, app plus 1 drink a piece and we were quickly approaching $100.  This place is not the laid back Noosa I have known in the past and definitely not the cool surf town on the Gold Coast as the name implies.  There are so many choices in the downtown Willoughby area I would think they would step up their game and make it worth the extra $$ they are charging."}
{"text":"First time visit was excellent.  You have to try the Ahi Tuna Tartare!  Great presentation and a healthy portion of Ahi on top of a wonderful crisp risotto cake all topped with a delicious guac.  We shared the prime rib which they graciously split on two plates before arrival.  Portion size was easily feeding two people!

We were in a bit early and on a Monday night, so not much of a crowd in the dining area yet.  Our server was delightful and attentive."}
{"text":"I want to add an update stating that Noosa is still going strong.  Food and service is the best around.  Took a neighbor there, his first time,  and he was very impressed.   
-"}
{"text":"Love Noosa - the food, the atmosphere, the staff and location are excellent.  The only comment I would have for the management would be for the price of the meal you really should include a salad.  Even a house salad would be fine but to pay additionally for one is not right."}
{"text":"Having inside info or looking at the website helps one reach beyond the fast food exterior and venture inside.  Tables could do without the TGIF color glossies of deserts. Otherwise ownership did a decent job of creating ambiance.  
Wine list served us well.
The waitstaff was knowledgeable, courteous, and kind.  
My friend enjoyed a nicely prepared but a tad bland pork chop($22.00) and I enjoyed the Noosa stuffed chicken($19.50).
The deserts looked very delicious but we did not indulge.
If in the area again, I plan on dining there again."}
{"text":"Ok I came her Monday afternoon before I started my second job. Right away I was greeted. The lady seemed a little distracted but she greeted me and asked if I wanted a lunch menu. I said yes and ordered my glass of wine and looked over the menu. I ordered my appetizer (muscles and an order of bread and butter) she asked if I needed anything else and I said that news still looking at the menu. The muscles took 15 minutes or so to come out but they were cold. It didn't matter they were fantastic. I only got checked on once and she never asked if I wanted to order more. I was finally able to order the noosa salad(definitely recomend) and the petite filet super small portions but flavor was insane. A little over cooked for my taste but I liked it. Over all a decent experience"}
{"text":"Blackened Ahi Tuna was excellent. The staff is very friendly and I love the new location."}
{"text":"Noosa is a pretty decent restaurant.  I have been there a few times and the food was good every visit.  We have been there with friends and family and they all seemed to enjoy the food as well.  The menu features a range of items, I am partial to pasta and normally find something I like.  It is a little pricey, but seems reasonable for what you get."}
{"text":"Noosa Bistro will always have a spot in my heart.  Situated in a cozy spot on Mentor Ave., this is the perfect place to relax, have a drink, and eat some awesome food.  Whether dining solo (yes, I do that from time to time - I used to frequent this cozy restaurant with my dinner companion being my sketch book or a magazine), with friends, or a significant other, it's the perfect vibe for just about any dining company you have.  

Noosa has a pretty extensive martini and wine list, so you'll be sure to find something you love.  The food options are also very plentiful and oh so delicious.  I'm OBSESSED with the warm spinach salad - don't judge!  Give it a try and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised!  The tuna tartar starter is also great and scallops and the stuffed chicken entrees are pretty fab also.  

So if you're looking for a good, cozy place to eat, check out Noosa."}
{"text":"This has seriously been one of my favorite restaurants for a few years now, and I am a picky person. The food is always delicious, the staff is usually attentive. The atmosphere is great! I've been in for quick lunches, dinner dates, business meetings, the works; and I'm always happy! On top of that I'm a General Manager of a restaurant myself and I know how much hard work goes into keeping that level of consistency! Kudos."}
{"text":"When you ask to sample the pesto, and the waitress says 'I'm sorry, our chef's only make the sauces to order.' you know you're in a good place.

Martini Bar got me there, the food will get me back... and the martini's (again!). $5 for a martini is pretty good, especially when you have a whole menu dedicated to them. From the usuals, dirty, etc to the surprising (try the Sweet Tarts! Glass garnished in ground up sweet tarts!) The martini's are delicious and not watered down. (I had to send back a dirty martini 5 times at a Cheesecake Factory... but these guys are nailing each one every time)

Then came the decision for dinner... Just the right amount of choices and selection. I got the Chilean Sea Bass and couldn't have been happier. I won't even try it at another restaurant because I don't want my memory tainted with a less than 'excellent' reminder.

Where it loses its 5th star is the ending bill. For a few drinks and a memorable meal with your main squeeze or a buddy from out of town, you're looking at $50-$70 with a tip. And tip well. They deserve it. Attentive, kind, knowledgeable and professional, Noosa might sound like the end of the road, but after your first visit, it will be the start of a beautiful relationship."}
{"text":"Another EXCELLENT dinner at Noosa. Stopped by for New Year's Eve and sat at the bar for dinner. Prefix menu but many variations of the usual dishes. Fillet was perfect. Baked au gratin potatoes were also perfect. 

Chaz was behind the bar and made great mixes as usual. 

Have been going to Noosa regularly since it opened. Always a great meal."}
{"text":"Stopped to have a bite before shopping on a Sunday. The hours must have changed, they do offer brunch. A ton of food! The omelet was just okay, taking half of it with me. Friendly service. 

I asked about happy hour and learned that they serve 10 oz martinis for $5 on a Friday, $2 domestic beers. Nothing wrong with that! 

I'll come back to try a steak or seafood, the customer service surmounted the average meal at brunch. Here's hoping...."}
{"text":"The food in here are all amazing !! We order a lots and all of them were great ! The lamb the seafood the salmon the wine , they were all great ! And it is not expensive ! Car park available. Washroom is clean."}
{"text":"Why can't you give 0 stars, the food is terrible don't waste your time or money!!! Not fresh not good cold over cooked food. Drinking won't even help the taste! Unprofessional people McDonald's has more customer service!"}
{"text":"The new place is fantastic!  Starting with the hostess's Kim and Susan( owner) they were both very kind and welcoming. The service and food were both fantastic. My boyfriend and I both had the salmon, it was fabulous! The salads were great, and the warm bread served with warm roasted garlic and olive oil is delightful. The servers were working very hard ( it was very busy) and all were very friendly. We love this place and will definitely be back. Kudos to the owners Rob and Susan, they do a fabulous job!!"}
{"text":"This is our first visit to Noosa Bistro and we will be back for sure.  It's really pretty (and clean) inside.  The staff were really nice and shared their menu favorites.  We ended up getting chicken marsala and a steak wrap.  Portions were perfect.  The chicken marsala came with mashed potatoes and green beans.  It was delicious.  The steak wrap came with fries.  The wrap was very good and the fries were crispy on the outside, soft in the middle."}
{"text":"Great food, but very poor service. Ended up waiting 20 minutes before the waitress even came over to take drinks. Had to ask another waitress to take our order. Definitely will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I went to Noosa Bistro with some co-workers recently.  The appetizers were really good - but our main dishes were kind of ...blah. 

The service was okay. The waitress that we had seemed disoriented and didn't know very much about what was available (even on their happy hour menu!).  The parking situation is pretty horrendous - the parking lot is very tight and tiny and it is right off a busy intersection. 

I probably will not go to Noosa again."}
{"text":"After finding out at the last minute that they were having a Easter buffet, we booked dinner for 12.  When we first drove up, my husband realized that it used to be a Burger King.  I thought for sure I just ruined Easter dinner for a dozen people. Once inside, it was easy to forget about Burger King.  

The food was fantastic!!! Not one person had anything that they did not like. The prime rib was absolutely perfect. 

We can't wait to go back. If they have a Mother's Day brunch, we're so there!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is superb, the food is exceptional and the martini list is great. The ambiance is so cool, love the decor. It recently relocated and everytime I'm in town I go there, the seafood cobbler is so incredible.  Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Fantastic!!!!!  To start Tiana made the best dirty martini I ever drank. Grey Goose, dry vermouth(not too much), three olives and a chilled glass. SMOOTH BABY, very Smooth. 
      Then dinner, I had the scallops, my buddy had the Osso Bucco(pork shank). WOW!!!  Pork fell off the. One and the scallops were scrumptious. For dinner had Guenoc Claret. It worked well with both pork and scallops.
      Personnel very friendly and helpful. Bathrooms clean. Susan and Jack, great hosts. Thank you so much. Can't wait to go back!!!!

Kenny Cahill"}
{"text":"My first experience at Noosa was an enjoyable yet pricey one. I spent some time looking over the menu, and they have exceptional taste in meal selection, the martini was fab, and the food tasted out of this world. I ordered a filet and this was modrately price, most everything else was a bit too expensive for me tho. I love quality and this rstaurant provided it. The server was an awesome host and waited on our table quickly and efficiently. I recomend, some reconsiderations on the prices for cerain meals. This would set this place to be one of Mentor's premiere small restaurants. Every small business owner wants reservations booked everynight."}
{"text":"Noosa is a bistro located right on Mentor ave, off Rt 306. It serves up a delicious array of classic and upscale bistro fare along with a great Martini list!

I'm not going to lie - a major part of this rating comes on the tail of their Margatini (Half Margarita, Half Martini, Complete Awesomeness) and their Calamari (crispy, delicious and svoury... Mmmm..)

Add to that the fact that they accommodate you with Creme Brulee to go (not something I have had many other places do).... and you can see why I'm a fan! If you're in the area, Noosa is definitely a good place to check out!"}
{"text":"I've been to Noosa Bistro twice, and have been pretty pleased both times.  I tend to gravitate towards exotic seafood dishes when I'm out at a nice restaurant, and in this case had the pan-seared wasabi tuna with rice and vegetables.  I also started the evening off with the lobster bisque, which was the best I've tasted.

Noosa touts itself as a martini and wine bar as well as restaurant, and I sampled a few generous martinis (the \"007\" and the \"mocha\").  The interior ambience is pretty nice, although a bit generic, and the service was very good.  There was classic jazz playing on the \"muzak\" that was better than what you'd hear at most restaurants (without actually hearing a great live jazz group, of course!).  The bill can get a bit pricey between the entrees and big martinis, but is well worth it for a night out.

There did appear to be some outdoor seating, but as the \"bistro\" is located on a busy 4-lane thoroughfare in the middle of suburban Mentor, it can't hold a candle to sidewalk cafes in the Warehouse District."}
{"text":"Let me say that this is the best-tasting dinner food I've had in the Cleveland area thus far. Having said that, nothing is perfect and the food isn't everything.....

Pros:

- The food was awesome (I had some veal plate with rissotto...with green beans on the side).
- The waitress was attentive and genuinely seemed friendly and experienced.

Cons:

- The tables are too damn close together. Whatever this was before wasn't re-purposed very well.
- The prices are high....not such a big deal with quality food but with the tables so close together.... 
- The whole place could use a little bit of a pick-mew-up...something to make it a little less dreary. 
-The brownie dessert wan't that good. Tasted/felt like they were baked individually....almost tasted like the outside was very stale and the inside was normalish. Weird to me."}
{"text":"Great seafood! You can't go wrong when you order the special . Great selection of bourbon and scotch, Beautiful wine list."}
{"text":"Walked in last night to grab a quick bite to eat around 6:30. Maybe three people seated and eating.. I don't know how. It smelled like a barn; quite literally a barn.
I thought maybe I could get over the smell and took a look at the menu, but before I even got past the appetizers I couldn't take it any more.
Would have loved to actually try the food as the menu seemed interesting and I've heard good things but I couldn't get past the fact that I was expecting an \"oink\" or a \"cluck\" to come from the kitchen... and not on a plate..."}
{"text":"Best around.  I eat there 2 to 3 times a week.  Quality food and people.  Strongly reccomended!"}
{"text":"The smell is overwhelmingly strong inside the restaurant and not like outstanding food....more like a circus. 
Not sure how the health department hasn't checked this out. 
The martinis are excellent."}
{"text":"Love the new location! The chicken Marsala was to die for. So so tasty! The drinks were great and the bartender was hilarious and very accommodating. He recommend his favorites and we were so glad he did because it was all delicious!"}
{"text":"this place in mentor ohio is very over rated, I ordered the sea food pasta and the dish looked great but had not flavor, i added salt and pepper still no seafood flavors i was very disappointed the people were very nice but that isn't why i went there,not good"}
{"text":"Small, quiet resturants. Second visit there this evening. Nice patio for dinning when the weather is good. Excellent place for oysters, although a bit pricey.
Bacon wrapped, crab meat stuffed fillet was very good. Cooked perfectly to order."}
{"text":"Great food, service, and atmosphere! Had the burgers, sandwiches, and chicken part and all were outstanding! Trying the steaks next! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"This has to be the WORST dining experience of my life.  The food was fine.  The service was fine.  Ambiance, fine.  The problem was the waitress was new and left ON HER OWN to be bartender, waitress and cashier. She then had an issue with the cash machine not working and we had to leave (as did EVERYONE in the restaurant) our names & phones b/c she COULD NOT GET A HOLD OF MANAGEMENT.  I received a call to come pay my bill.  Befor I could even get to Noosa, they had MENTOR POLICE call me!!  Long story short, I will NEVER, EVER, EVER go there.  It was my first and LAST visit.  HORRID.  Manager Wesley was awful when I spoke to him on the phone.  The waitress ended up quitting (can't say I blame her, she was near tears)."}
{"text":"Tried the new location 3 times which we stopped going to the old location after several food fiasco's. The new place is a positive improvement the only real thing i see is the quantity is heavily weighed down by their big prices. For those portion sizes and prices maybe salads might help compensate for those small portions. one day the menu has some awesome dishes we go back few days later because of how good the sea bass dish was and they changed the menu which the sea bass is now severed with boring lacking flavor plain rice.   
We also made reservations and still had to wait 30 mins due to our table accidentally being seated. Overall if they work on making sure you don't go home hungry with a big hole in your pocket they might be a big hit but that will all start on being less stingy on their plates. 

We will give them a try again maybe in the summer and see how they are a fourth time."}
{"text":"I recently visited Mentor to go to the James A. Garfield National Historic Site.  Upon arriving in Mentor we decided to get some food before touring Garfield's home.  We drove down the street and found Noosa.  We decided to try it since it was somewhere new.

Actually, I must confess that the only reason I wanted to go here was because it was a fine dining restaurant in an old Burger King.  However, once you're inside you would never know.  The restaurant is well decorated and has accents of wood.  The tables have tablecloths.  The space is dark, but accented with much ambient lighting.  There is a fairly large bar area.  The front has a large outdoor patio.  

The menu was original and varied.  I tried a wrap with chicken and brie.  The wrap was good but the flavors were a little flat.  It needed a little spice.  I also had a bowl of tomato soup which was heavenly.  The complimentary homemade bread was divine.  My father got the crab melt (like a tuna melt but crab) and said that it was very good.  They have homemade potato chips that accompany the sandwiches which are excellent as well.

We were here at a slow time.  There was only one other table.  Our server however was not very attentive he seemed to be distracted.  We'd have to wait for water refills and such.

Overall, it was an excellent meal.  I'd like to come back for dinner if I'm ever in the neighborhood again."}
{"text":"We stop here a couple times a month. Always enjoy the well made martinis. We like to sit at the bar. We had very good clam bake dinners last night. One with chicken and one with steak. Great deal. Large bucket of clams (dozen) along with shrimp and mussels. Red skin potatoes, half an ear of corn and cole slaw come with the bake. A great deal $27 chicken and $30 steak. Call first to make sure of availability."}
{"text":"Slow service. Cold food. Crabby waitstaff. Made a reservation and had to wait while others that came after us were seated. The hostesses couldn't seem to get it together. This place isn't much bigger if any then the old one. I don't get it. Super disappointed and we won't be back. Maybe for Sunday Brunch, but that's it."}
{"text":"What a great place!  Love the new location!  The menu is updated and the decor is beautiful.  We started with the truffle fries, mussels and calamari appetizers.  All were delicious! We couldn't believe how many mussels were in the order. For our entrees we had steak, tuna, salmon and, for the vegetarian in our group, veggie pizza. We all enjoyed our dinners tremendously!  The salmon was probably one of the most flavorful entrees I've ever had and I wished I hadn't eaten so many truffle fries!  
The service was top notch and the bar looks like a lot of fun. We are already planning a return visit!"}
{"text":"Came in after a Saturday workout for a quick lunch at the bar with a friend. We split the chicken wrap and the salmon burger on pretzel bun special. Both were phenom. Service was quick at the bar and very well priced. The atmosphere is nice - it would be a great place for a work lunch or simple dinner out.

Called today to make quick reservations for the patio for a work lunch and am all set to dine again."}
{"text":"The food was good but not worth the price.  My husband's prime rib had no flavor.  Waitress was very nice but had to wait along time for drinks and food.  Asked for no tomatoes in my order and it came with tomatoes.  Too expensive for the quality of food."}
{"text":"Hands down, one of the finest dining experiences you can get in Lake County, Ohio! From the minute my husband and I walked into the restaurant, it was warm and inviting. The ambiance was front and center, very cozy coming in from a chilly, damp evening. The wait staff was very friendly and on point. We've been meaning to check this place out for years now, so glad we did! It does not disappoint!

I started with a Key Lime martini. Very nicely done, not too tart, not too sweet. A great palate cleanser!

As an appetizer, we had the Ahi tuna tartare with avocado salsa, crispy risotto cake and soy glase. It was nothing short of amazing! The Ahi tuna was melt in your mouth perfection. The mixture of the creaminess of the avocado salsa and the crunch of the risotto cake bathed in the soy glase was just over the top, total flavor country!

We were also served a basket or two of the tasty, crusty, chewy house bread with the herbed whipped butter. Deliciousness!!!

My main course was the Maryland lump crab cakes, with fennel slaw, roasted red pepper aioli on a bed of cheesey grits. They were moist on the inside, just crisp enough on the outside. All of the flavors on the plate complimented one another amazingly!

My husband's main course was the Sunday special: Soup d'jour (which was to-die-for tomato basil soup) Prime rib with horseradish sauce, au jus, haricot verts (green beans) and whipped potatoes! Everything was delicious, cooked to perfection. 

My only complaints are: 1. Our waiter forgot to remind us that this Sunday Special CAME WITH dessert. (We turned down dessert because we were full, though it should have been offered as a to go option...that is the waiter's job, after all!)  Oh well. I guess we gotta pay more attention to the menus...
2. The booths were too damn close together! Next time we will sit at a table!
3. The bathroom was really dreary and dingy! In need of some updating for sure!

While those things are minor, overall, we can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"So these guys just reopened after moving to The Diamond Center off Heisley Road. 
The food is still just so excellent! I have been waiting months for a bowl of their Tomato Basil Soup. It did not disappoint. 
My one recommendation would be for everyone to please make a reservation for dinner. They are still figuring out staffing and how busy they are on what night, etc. we did not have a reservation 3 days after their opening, and due to staffing issues, there was quite a wait. Many people got tired of waiting and left. Others came in and walked right out because of the wait. Give them a break. They WILL get their feet back under them and regroup. 
We were saved by our server, who came in as we waited, took us to a table right away & provided top notch service. 
As I said, the food is just excellent. My scallops were beautiful. The lamb chops were a bit thin, but perfectly cooked. The pork chop is amazing!
We will absolutely be back! But next time, we will make a reservation, which can be done online at their website."}
{"text":"Randomly made a trip here and wasn't disappointed! They have a huge martini menu, it was hard to pick which one but the bartender was great at recommending things. Tried a couple of different ones and they were all amazing, they also have a good food menu. definitely recommend trying this place out, and will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I heard good things so we had a girls night at Noosa.  The food was terrible, the martinis were warm and even the water/ice tasted bad.  The artichoke crab dip was fishy and not very good.  We had a meat sampler platter that we ordered medium rare.  Everything came out well done with overcooked vegetables.  The only thing that was palatable was the bread!  And the final bill was $186 for four people!  Granted we had a few martinis and I think that was the only thing that stopped us from being really angry and demanding refunds. I suspect that this restaurant will fail and it has nothing to do with the location (many places have failed in this location).

Also, like a previous reviewer stated - the place spelled really fishy.  The menus looked old and dirty and the place is just worn out."}
{"text":"Beautiful remodel of the restaurant but 0% chance I will be back. We had a table of 6 which was able to be seated right away. First of all, it took at least 15 minute to get drinks, not a good start.  When we finally receive the drinks they were served by our waiter which obviously was coming off a bender from the night before because he was sweating and his hands were shaking Three people ordered the salmon on a bed of rice which was good buy itself but the rest of the plate was boring and bland. I had the fillet which was cooked correctly but very bland and did not look like a fillet cut. I was told it was served with mashed potatoes but was served with au gratin and the vegetables included were three anorexic strings of asparagus. The other two meals were a salad with chicken on it and a burger. They had to re-cook the burger because it was over done and they forgot the chicken on the chicken salad. When they receive their meals everyone was already done and The food was not that great to make up for the wait. The meal,including tip, was about $365. We had a couple beers and glasses of wine but not A bottle or hard liquor. The service was extremely slow and I heard the same thing from other diners with different servers.  No manager ever came by to see how our meal was which was surprising for a new restaurant trying to establish itself in a new location. I don't mind spending a lot of money on a meal but it has to be by professional staff and superb chef. As I said, I will never go back"}
{"text":"The service, top notch.  But 15$ for two small fish tacos and ice tea, not so much.  Come on, be a bit more reasonable.  But they were, tasty."}
{"text":"The food was spectacular and well worth the price. Our server Brandon made our meal and dining experience absolutely wonderful. It was evident he had a heart of gold as we told him we were celebrating a new job. He noticed we were engaged and asked about our wedding plans and we explained our love for our dogs and that they would be in the wedding. We ordered the prime rib and had leftovers and he thoughtfully asked if we wanted to take it home for our Great Dane. The prime rib was to die for - it fell apart in your mouth, was juicy, cooked perfectly, and had great flavor. We also ordered the stuffed salmon, wedge salad, spinach salad, and martinis. All of the food was fresh, and phenomenal. We will definitely be visiting Noosa again in the future !! Thank you again to Brandon to made our night extra special !!"}
{"text":"Had lunch at the new location, our server was Christina. Place was pretty busy for a Wednesday early afternoon....Christina was so bubbly and knowledgeable! Helped me decide on a menu choice and loved her recommendation. Food was delicious-especially the spinach salad. Can't wait to return and request her as our server next time too!"}
{"text":"Jonathan did a wonderful job taking care of our party, which was a lunch following a memorial service at a local funeral home. Naturally, we did not know how many people to expect and Jonathan was very understanding and supportive. We had a limited-selection banquet menu. Food and service were excellent. We felt very well cared-for. The restaurant and employees were warm and welcoming. I can't recommend them highly enough."}
{"text":"New location, just opened, nicely remodeled previous Brown Derby with a very elegant interior. The food is excellent and we were happy that they brought along most of the menu. We had a very delightful meal and I'm sure they will do very well at the new location."}
{"text":"Yes! The perfect combo: delicious bistro menu and martini bar. Our waiter was so helpful; he asked what flavors we liked and suggested martini options! We sipped our way through martinis and thoroughly enjoyed our curry chicken spring rolls and dipping sauce, chicken marsala, chop, and the most amazing duck breast with saffron risotto cakes.

We'll be back. The menu has so many options (pasta, fish, chicken, meat, salads). This is a great spot for dinner with friends, family or a romantic evening."}
{"text":"I was so glad to hear that Noosa opened up at their new location. I loved Noosa at their old location and I love Noosa at their new location. The inside is beautiful and spacious. At the bar,they have phone chargers connected to the bar top for your convenience! How clever! Very useful.
I came for Sunday brunch around 2 pm. It seems Sunday is one of their slower days so I took advantage. I order the Cali Benedict-English muffin, tomato, smoked salmon, avocado, poached egg, hollandaise-deliciousness!! The egg was perfectly poached and the toppings were fresh. The only thing I was not a big fan if were the Noosa potatoes as my side. They were just a little blah. Oh well I just know not to get them next time. NBD.
They offer lunch and dinner 7 days a week and brunch on Sunday's. There is also happy hour M-F at the bar.

Wesley the bartender was an absolute peach. Very personable and great personality. These are a necessity in the service industry and he has it. I go out to eat a lot and usually sit at the bar. Most bartenders I've encountered have little personality, on their phones, complaining to other staff, and say no more than 3 words to you, if that. Wesley asked me how my weekend was going and struck up a conversation through out my stay. Thanks Wesley!

After reading some reviews I have to remind you that this place just recently opened. Be patient, make a reservation if you plan on coming during prime hours. Cut them some slack. People are just being people....*rolls eyes*. No need to be harsh. 

I plan to come back for lunch or dinner to try some more of the menu. Them entrees sound do good and by looking at pictures posted, I need to try them stat!"}
{"text":"I've stopped in twice now since they've moved to their new location. The atmosphere is contemporary and slightly upscale where you could justify dressing up for a special occasion or coming casual. I loved the soothing blues in the decor. There's a stone fireplace in one of the two dining rooms giving a warm cozy feel to the space contrasting the stark white table clothes. It's a good balance. 

Our two service experiences were quite different. The first visit we sat at the bar and the staff were friendly, smiling and conversational. There is a happy hour M-F from 3:00-7:00 and I'd recommend this as the prices are much more reasonable on the bar food apps. They also have a happy hour martini list. This day we tried the truffle fries and the ginger snap calamari. While neither of them were bad, I have to say I would not order them again. The calamari was perfectly cooked and light with dipping sauces but I could not taste gingersnap whatsoever. It was basic calamari, nothing special. The fries had a slight truffle flavor with some blue cheese sauce on them but seemed to me to be cooked from frozen. The sauce was a bit heavy for my taste. 

On my second visit a group of four of us had a 7:00 reservation in the dining room. I was the first to arrive and the hostess left me standing in the lobby until another one of my party arrived at 7:15. There were multiple tables open and I would've enjoyed being seated to order a glass of wine while I waited. It felt VERY inhospitable to me to be left standing in the lobby!

Our server was very abrupt the entire evening and somewhat condescending in her interaction with us. Before we left, one of our party went in to use the restroom and there was a woman sweeping the floors. One stall was in use while the other two were open. The employee told her not to use the two open stalls because she had toilet bowl cleaner in them. She had to wait several minutes for the other stall to open up. The service experience on this visit overall was quite unusual and disappointing, even kind of comical to us. 

As far as the food, I ordered the tomato bisque and the beet salad with added chicken. The tomato bisque was excellent. It had great creamy flavor with chunks of tomato. The salad was lightly dressed... which I typically like, but I could barely even taste the dressing. A bit more would have been better. The lettuces were fresh. The chicken was well seasoned but a little too dry and over cooked. The beets were obviously jarred, which was very disappointing at this type of a place. There were not many beets or much cheese for the price of the salad. 

I love that this is a local place and they are providing another option to all the chains in the area. So far, while the food has not been bad, I have not been terribly impressed either because I think they need to use less convenience items in their dishes at their price point. I just haven't seen the value in their offerings yet. I will return to try some of the dinners and other menu items to see if they're more scratch made."}
{"text":"Noosa Bistro.  Striped bass w spaghetti squash, risotto cake on carrot puree, and Noosa salad and bruschetta.  Plus great creative martinis."}
{"text":"I so wanted to like this restaurant but between the owner wearing slide on flip flops while darting in and out of the kitchen & running food to the clam chowder with it thin milky broth, mushy potatoes & carrots to my lukewarm Fresco Crab Melt, I wasn't impressed. 
I asked the sever who was also the bartender (we were there during lunch hr) if my melt was supposed to be warm or cold because it was in between both temperatures. The cheese on the top couldn't make up it's mind either. It wasn't quite melted and looked like it had been placed on top of the heavily mayo based sandwich as an afterthought and there it sat waiting for the warming lights on the line to help it melt. 
When I remarked to my friend that that the melt had a tuna like consistency due to all of the mayo the owner must have overheard my comment. He flip flopped his way over to our table and challenge me on my remark about my sandwich. He then basically called me a liar when I mentioned that the carrots and potatoes were so over cooked that they fell apart as soon as they touch my tongue. He was so rude that we became very uncomfortable and left. I did feel badly for our server. Apparently she is not given enough time to put away the many boxes of liquor and had to pay more attention to that task then her guests. 
As for my friend's Club sandwich it consisted of thinly sliced deli meat on a bun and looked like it belonged on Subway's menu. Nothing special. 
We would have given this restaurant another try but the owner's attitude quickly changed our minds. No  more Noosa for us!"}
{"text":"it was ok. Ate here about a year ago and I don't even really recall what I had except this terrible martini. Nice atmosphere, so I give it an extra star for that."}
{"text":"We were excited to try this place and we were slightly disappointed. 

First of all, it is quite costly. $22 fish and chip special, $8 brownie, $14 appetizer. Our bill was $78 -- that's one beer, one appetizer, a shared dessert and 2 of the daily \"specials\"

The bread was amazingly good and our server, Wesley was attentive and did a competent job. 

The brownie they showed us on the dessert tray was two times thicker than the one they brought us and the scoop of ice cream was too!!

The ahi tartare appetizer was very good

Our meals -- fried Cod -- was Eh. I could have had that anywhere and paid much less. 

All in all, a downer. I would have given this 2.5 stars if I knew how."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant and service staff. Linda did an excellent job with our party of 12 keeping everyone's drinks full and explaining our options.  Food came out quickly and was extremely tasty. I had scallops (3 large) that were fantastic with the sweet corn. Steaks others had were enjoyed as well as the salmon. Great dessert options too. We are all leaving stuffed. Visiting the area for work training, all 12 of us from across the county."}
{"text":"Never again. My family has been to Noosa multiple times so I decided to go there for my birthday dinner. It was a Monday night and we had a party of 17.  The restaurant was not crowded at all, there were maybe 3 or 4 other tables occupied with small parties at each when we got there. The server stood at one end of the table to announce the specials for that evening and it appeared she was only speaking to the guests at that end of the table, no one other than two or three people could hear her. The appetizers/salads came out relatively fast but the dinner portion was a disaster. The food came out 3 plates at a time with a window of about 10 minutes in between. I know we had a large party but at this time, we were the ONLY table in the restaurant. The servers were not apologetic at all that some meals were taking so long. While the server was passing a dish over my head, she spilled red wine reduction sauce from the plate ALL OVER ME. Happy birthday to me!! The shirt I was wearing was ruined. I had to ask HER to bring me a glass of club soda. By the time we all ate it was about 3 hours after our reservation time. It took ANOTHER 1/2 hour for the checks to be passed out among the group and 4/6 of them were wrong and had to be taken back. 
The manager did come over and apologize for everything but at the point everyone was miserable. He gave every check in the party a 10$ gift-card but I can assure you that no one from our party of 17 will be back. 
The food was good but this place is not cheap so I expected better than good, especially on my birthday. 

If you're going with one or two people you might be fine but good luck. Also, don't wear any shirt you like."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in Mentor.  The menu, service and martini selection are quite impressive.  You know how nice restaurants typically worry more about presentation vs quantity of food???  No worries here...Noosa brings both of them to your table.  I'm from Florida and have had the best seafood dishes without question--Noosa ranks with some of those fantastic experiences.  My recent selections have been blackened swordfish, grilled scallops, and a few unique martinis that I haven't found anywhere else."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a really great lunch here today on the patio at Noosa Bistro. Nice decor both inside and the patio and we were greeted warmly and shown to our table promptly.
Friendly and experianced waitress served us and recommend today's specials but we decided on the seafood pasta and crabcake.
My seafood pasta was fresh, perfectly cooked and delicious! My wife's crabcake was very tasty and loaded with crab and served on very tasty cheese grits.
Very good food and ambiance and we definately will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Just tried Noosa. They have only been at this location three months. The place is decorated well and the staff is exceptionally friendly. Service was fast and attentive for a lunch. Bar has a good selection of beer wine and liquors at low prices. Had their Tomato bisque and special prime rib. Both were a reason to come back. The prime rib was juicy with loads of meat and a nice horseradish sauce."}
{"text":"Everything here is amazing, I would know because while I was here for business I went like 6+ times, no complaints at all. Super friendly staff."}
{"text":"This was our 4th time at Noosa.  We have not been disappointed yet... started with the Ahi Tuna Tartare once again.. lots of Ahi and wonderfully presented.  Surprised to find the clam bake on the menu ... $27 with chicken, $30 if NY strip.  With the dozen clams, 3 mussels, shrimp, cup of clam chowder,potatoes, corn, great vinegary coleslaw and wonderful bread, this is easily shared between two.  Saw the previous comments on someone's experience with the Chardonnay, but we did  not have that issue with the Cab or Pinot Grigio we ordered.  Server very attentive and pleasant.  Great night -"}
{"text":"Great food and beautiful decor. New waitress outstanding. Good variety. Our party had selections from burger  to chicken piccata. Both excellent. Tomato bisque and beef barley soup delicious. Margarita pizza very tasty. Bruschetta and pecan crusted chicken tenders also enjoyed."}
{"text":"We just had to share about our experience, which was THE ABSOLUTE BEST we've had anywhere, including many big chain restaurants, in over a decade.  Our server was Kim, who was extremely efficient, helpful and friendly.  We always hesitate to try somewhere slightly more expensive, knowing the possibility of a hit or miss.  This was a BIG HIT!  Our food was so good, we'd have paid double and still felt like we got our money's worth.  We ordered the Stuffed Chicken Special and the Butternut Ravioli, which were both phenomenal!  We also had Tomato Bisque soup, Chocolate Mousse and Creme Brulee, which were all excellent.  We had begun to be disillusioned with reading positive restaurant reviews followed by negative experiences.  It felt like the standard for great food had fallen so low that bad had become good.  Noosa Bistro restored our faith that someone out there knows how to make food that tastes like it came from your Great Grandmother's kitchen- food based on fresh and genuine taste not food based on salts and sugars.  The atmosphere was very relaxing and welcoming.  The decor was ok and could probably use some remodeling or updating but when it comes down to it, are you going to eat somewhere because someone highly recommends the food or the interior design?  We HIGHLY RECOMMEND Noosa Bistro and cannot wait to go back!  Our regards to the chef, our waitress Kim and the owners."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and both times the food has been very good. I had the sea bass the first time and the lamb this time. Both were cooked perfectly and very flavorful. I also enjoyed the veggies that came with the meal it was a nice mix that matched well with my meal. My girlfriend got the salmon and she was very happy with it. The service was pretty good, the waiter kept our drinks full and he knew the specials. We also had deserts and they were pretty good, I'm pretty sure everything here was made from scratch. I will keep coming back and trying new things I suggest if you're in the area you give this place a try it's one of the better dinner places on Mentor Ave."}
{"text":"One star because I had to in order to post this. Made reservations and the rude hostess still acted like we walked in off the street. Waited over two hours before getting up and leaving before the entrees even came. It took two hours for the waitress to come out and tell me the kitchen was out of my meal. That's the point when we walked out. Our waitress was a doll and so apologetic. The hostess (aka the owner) gave us a \"gift card\" that was $10 off 2 entrees. Left those on the table. The entire back dining room cleared out. It's not like it's their first night OR these people have never been in the business before. The old restaurant might have been smaller and a bit fishy smelling, but at least they could handle the business. Will never be returning. Do not waste your time."}
{"text":"been here a few times mostly for drinks. never ate here so this is why i gave them 4 stars, apparently the previous owner had issues with people skills but current owner took it over and things are looking brighter!! and it's pretty good. i had allot of fun here drink prices seem like the norm and if your looking for fast food this is not your place. the menu looks delicious and prices seem to be about average compared to most in area with this hi caliber experience. I will definitely be back and love to try some of the tasty items on menu. what burns me up in all these reviews most people eat at chain or fast food places then come to a place that actually has real food from scratch and complain. don't let these reviews ruin your dining experience. and on a footnote if your not happy with something open your mouth even if it's after your first sip of wine or first bite of food!!!!!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch at Noosa's today.   Simply outstanding!  Enjoyed a cup of the chicken tortilla soup and it was fresh and flavorful.  Ordered the special of the day, a spinach salad with avocado, blue cheese, chicken, egg.   Served with an avocado vinaigrette dressing.  Everything was fresh and it was one of the best main salads I've had in quite some time.  Service also great.  Thank you Noosa's!"}
{"text":"One of Mentors hidden gems.  This has been a favorite of mine for years.  Every dish I have tried has been above my expectations. You can't go wrong with any of their dishes.  They allow you to substitute pretty much anything which is AMAZING because I'm so picky.  This is definitely a place to try if you haven't! And the atmosphere? Adorable!! Perfect for a date night!"}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch, do yourself a favor and go. I had the Cali-Benedict (smoked salmon, avocado, hollandaise, egg, English muffin). Mom had the corned beef hash. Step-dad had steak and eggs. Real steak, inch thick, cooked perfectly. Not the shoe leather steak you get for breakfast at your greasy spoon. Service perfect, atmosphere upscale. Drink selection very good. We all loved the food and said we'd be back. Granted, it's not cheap.I took a Casablanca salad to go. When I got home my wife said, this was $10? Well, it was beautiful and fresh, so yeah, I'll pay $10 for that I guess."}
{"text":"I've been to Noosa several times in the past & really enjoyed it. Unfortunately, this time was not so great. The waitress said they had Roasted Corned Beef Sandwiches for the lunch special. It sounded delicious as we both love corned beef so we both ordered it. The chef \"roasted\" the corned beef so long that he turned it into dry roast beef. It was dry and chewy, not moist & savory like corned beef should be. Needless to say, we won't be back for lunch : ("}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and every single time I've never had a good experience... Either the food came out cold.. or the food took forever to get to me... I definitely wouldn't recommend"}
{"text":"Great place in Mentor for lunch and dinner. the decor is a little old school but the food here is excellent.
I have dined here here several times. This time was a quick lunch. I had the Tuna sesame salad and my colleague had the soup and sandwich,all were excellent. One of the best places in Mentor."}
{"text":"I have heard rave reviews about Noosa's, particularly after moving to their new location in the Diamond Plaza. I went there with my family for a celebration of my grandmother's 77th's birthday. It was not living up to the reviews that I heard. The food was very pricey, which we were willing to pay for a great experience and quality. However, the food was simply sub-par quality that tasted similar to the Ruby Tuesday's across the street. The restrooms were filthy--there was blood covering the toilet seats, no paper, and there was no garbage can by the door so people were just throwing the papers towels on the floor by the door, not to mention the atrocious smell! The service was extremely slow. I know we had a table for 9 people but we were there for more than three hours. The servers were nice, but the service itself, perhaps due to the kitchen or some other source, was just slow. The table they put us at was a table for about 6 people, not 9. We were packed in and my grandmother is wheelchair bound and she needed extra space that there simply was not enough of at the table. I was underwhelmed by the experience and do not plan on ever going back again. I do not recommend Noosa's to anyone."}
{"text":"THIS IS THE EMAIL I RECEIVED AFTER MY REVIEW  - CLASSY PLACE ISNT IT?  I did tell the waitress about the chardonnay I got another drink but was still charged for the wine which was barely touched.  

Hi Susan, For starters I am insulted that you think we \"water down\" chardonnay? Thats not even a thing! Are you kidding me? And everything from our kitchen is from scratch including our balsamic glaze, I suggest in the future if you are not happy with your chardonnay, or want more glaze, ASK YOUR SERVER! THEY ARE THERE TO ACCOMMODATE YOU! Also impossible for one scallop to not be cooked, they are sauteed together! Rather than bash us about untrue bullshit on YELP. I usually appreciate feedback, including negative, but your is uneduacted, fabricated ridiculous bullshit. Have a great day ! Susan"}
{"text":"My cousin and I had dinner this evening at Noosa Bistro. The hot, fresh bread and butter was a good way to start the meal, and we thoroughly enjoyed our dinners:  both the food and the gourmet presentation.  We were served giant mugs of coffee with our dessert.  Everything was so delicious and fresh.  The décor is inviting and comfortable.  Our waitress was friendly and very efficient, and served us our food piping hot.  We had a top quality meal, and a lovely evening."}
{"text":"Eh! Nothing special. Menu was very limited. Could use some upgrade in the appetizers. Potato skins, truffle fries   With blue cheese , rosemary and balsamic vinegar- yuck! 
Crab dip. Pretzel and chicken wings Not my idea of a \"bistro\" menu. Let's get a little creative. It's 2017."}
{"text":"We've gone a few times over the years. Some of the food can be pretty good. But the place smells like dead fish, and it's smelled like that for years now."}
{"text":"Prime Rib was very good with a reasonable priced Sebastiani!  Good value and an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Ok, so I arrived at Noosa at approximately 8:30PM on a random Saturday night, and sit at the bar. I order a very basic beverage, Captain Morgan and Diet Coke. I'm soon told that, sorry, we are out of Captain. Umm, ok, I'll take a sugar free Redbull and Tito's vodka...followed by, sorry we don't have sugar free Redbull...ok. Now, these are two very basic drinks that EVERYONE has. 

So I settle on a random beer. Shortly after, a gentleman sits two seats down from me, and orders two Coronas...he is shortly told, sorry, we only have one Corona...do you want something else?! Are you kidding me?!!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour during the week for martinis!  Food is pretty good and the bar area is great for a quick stop to meet friends."}
{"text":"My sister and I recently went to give Noosa a try, because A) I've always driven past it and my curiosity was killing me and B) it's one of the only places in Mentor that has patio seating (what's wrong with you people up there...).

We went for lunch on a Saturday around one. It was eerily quiet...no one was there except for the one server and ourselves. Paul was very nice and attentive as a server. We were hoping to just do appetizers or an array of them but there were only three appetizer options and none that we liked as options so we had to move onto something else as an option. My sis and I both ordered the lunch special which was a cup of soup, a salad and an option of a flatbread or 4oz burger. 

She had the soup du jour (I believe it was a vegetable-based soup of sorts) and I had the tomato basil. Both were good. Hers was a little watery in my opinion. Mine was pretty tasty. We both did the salad and burger option. 

The lunch trio was roughly $10 so I wasn't expecting greatness. The salad I had was a caesar and was less than exciting. Regular ol' iceberg with some cheese and dressing. Tomatoes were scarce (if I had any, I don't recall). The burger was really average. I was certainly expecting the reputation this place has via around town and on here it would've been better. The grill flavor in it was about the nicest thing and even that is minuscule in my opinion. I think the burger I can make was better. It was literally not seasoned at all, swiss cheese and a bun. No onions, tomato, lettuce, pickles--nada= B-O-R-I-N-G food.

I feel what I got it should've been $7-8. Not $10. If things were seasoned well and a bit more up in quality, $10 would've been fine. I have no quarrel for paying for a good meal but it wasn't as good as I had hoped it would be. 

Paul is a great asset to them though. He was very friendly and our food got out very quick-yet again though, it's probably because we were the only ones there so of course our service should've been top-notch. No excuse for it to not have been if it wasn't. 

Either way, not sure I'd come back. I feel it was kind of a waste of money and what I paid for was more to sit in the sun than anything else. 

If you're wondering about going, try it. I may try their happy hour. Supposedly they are \"known\" for their supposed \"strong drinks\". Then again, if it's a drink-I'm gay and have high-standards. What straight bars call \"strong\" is incessantly weak. Guess I'll have to see..."}
{"text":"I can't put my finger on exactly why this place was such a letdown, but it was. The website did a nice job of hyping the place up, and I had a coupon, so my now-wife and I headed out there on a Saturday night for a date. 

Maybe I was too excited? In any case, everything seemed...average? Our service was quite poor (you'd think that they'd have good service on a Saturday night) and the food was quite unremarkable. In addition to slow service, the wait staff was quite uninformed about the food. The place was also REALLY dark...dark works well if it's a romantic-sort-of-dark, but dark doesn't work well when it makes it hard to see the lovely lady sitting across from you. =)

It must not be totally bad, though--one of my co-workers was there that evening and told me later that she loves going there. Maybe we just ordered the wrong thing? Whatever the case may be, I don't think I'll be going here again--there's too many other great restaurants in Cleveland!"}
