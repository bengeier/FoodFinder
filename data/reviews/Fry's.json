{"text":"4 because there's this one cashier who, each time rang our purchases up (different weeks) always looked like a mix of anger and unhappiness for customers im general.  Store is clean, but I gotta say...having clothes for sale...somehow... I no longer wanna call it 'fancy frys' it now seems more like...'wannabe walmart.'   Almost down to a 3 thanks to that, BUT the pharmacy staff....AweSOME! Super courteous and helpful, really great empathy toward each customer. Not an easy task but they are shining stars in my book."}
{"text":"Every time I am in Phoenix I stay in a hotel for work, so I don't actually grocery shop. The first time I went here was to pick up some water and snacks for my room. They had a sushi sample and it was AMAZING. I bought a couple of boxes and brought it to my coworkers for lunch. They all loved it too! It is really hard to find good sushi in a grocery store, but Fry's sushi guys are awesome. This is now a must-stop for every trip . . . I choose this over going out to lunch or dinner. Definitely 5-stars for the sushi!!"}
{"text":"My main problem with this grocery store is with their deli. I occasionally order my deli meats shaved and it seems that they only manage to get this right about 40 percent of the time. The rest of the time they try to pass off very thinly sliced meat as shaved. The few times I have pointed this out or asked to have it redone, the deli employees have never been apologetic. Also, I would advise anyone shopping in this Fry's to be very careful about checking expiration dates on cold items. Overall, the store is nice, but many of the employees could use some extra training in customer service - the only exception to this would be the employees of the bakery - I've never had a bad experience with the bakery."}
{"text":"Love this store. Always has what I need in produce. Every time I'm there, staff is helpful and says hello. I drive out of my way to shop here."}
{"text":"This place has it all! Literally, anything from furniture, picture decor, to a pasta station and sushi bar! Everything is nicely presented, clean, and has a friendly staff. I don't like to shop anywhere else! The produce is fresh, there's hardly anything that goes out of stock unless it's the day of a holiday, and the selections are great. A perfect place for a glass of wine while shopping or to hang out. It's the way shopping should be, making a chore not feel like one."}
{"text":"If you have not been here, get off your butt and come shop here. This like what adult dreams are made of. A wine bar, Sushi bar, cooking demos, gourmet every thing. I love this place so much It hurts....."}
{"text":"They rigged the claw machine and those heartless douchebags that leave kids with empty piggy banks and broken hearts."}
{"text":"Meat counter in the deli is horrible and unprofessional. We have an Albertsons right by our house but drive a little further because Fry's is nicer and offers better quality items than Albertsons. We have tried to get chicken at the deli counter several times. There are kids working the counter who are unprofessional and seem like they are bothered by having to help you. There is a big sign right on the counter that says they guarantee they have fresh chicken. They never have ANY baked chicken at all. When you ask the worker if there will be any more they say no and could care less."}
{"text":"My husband and I asked the Fry's Bakery to make our gender reveal cake.  They were extremely professional and made an amazing cake for us!  We absolutely loved it!  It was also very professional.  It was much less expensive than a stand-alone bakery and the cake looked and tasted amazing.    We decided not to find out the gender beforehand and the team at Fry's was very careful about not revealing the gender to us, which we greatly appreciated.  When we cut into the cake, it was very obvious what the gender was and there was no way to tell from the outside even when we asked them to use frosting instead of fondant."}
{"text":"The best supermarket...end of story.  I like the covered parking, which helps in the dead of summer.  I haven't had need to use the car wash or valet parking service, but I think that it's a nice touch for people who cant walk far, mom's with kids and the elderly (or just super lazy).  The produce section has items I have never heard of and we have had fun trying new things.  The bakery has items that rival top tier bakeries, at half the price.  The meat department has a great presentation.  The service is great.  People watching isn't as good as Fashion Square, but it's not too shabby."}
{"text":"Excellent!! I have never shopped at a better grocery store!  Polite and pleasant employees- very helpful. You can tell the staff enjoys their job, overall. Very pleased with the selection of ethnic foods."}
{"text":"this is the best frys. so huge and its just so fancy"}
{"text":"Has everything you want - food, liquor, bakery, meat, sushi, Starbucks, pharmacy, home furnishings, flowers, car detailing, and lovely indoor and outdoor seating. The covered parking is great in the summer as well.  The prices are a touch higher than nearby alternatives but you can't get a more luxurious supermarket in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Seem all the Fry's stores allow DOGS in their stores, even though they are NOT  Service Animals.  1) It's against FDA Regulations,  2) It's against Arizona Statutes to have anything other than bonafide Service Animals in places that sell food.   Another thing can they guarantee that these animals DON'T have flees, DOdo have all their shots up to date, WON'T get scared and bite me or some other unsuspecting shopper?  And what about the little \"presents\" they may leave behind???  Don't want THOSE near food I might want to EAT!  Sounds like a lawsuit waiting to happen to me."}
{"text":"Best grocery store anywhere, simply because they have a bar in the middle of the massive store with several micro brews on tap, a wine bar, and a few flat screens. Grabbed a beer here one night with a buddy (seriously, I did) and felt like we were at, you guess it, a bar. Prices were actually slightly cheaper than being in a bar. What a great idea!"}
{"text":"The store is huge and has everything but wow the customer service needs some work.  I have had some rude run ins with the butcher department before and for some reason (probably because the store IS so big) I keep going back.  I think I am done now though.  I was looking to make a pre-order to pick up on Christmas Eve.  The unsmiling employee who seemed to be an assistant hesitated and then asked the main butcher \"Are we still doing pre-orders?\" He didn't even look up just barked \"NO MORE PRE-ORDERS!\"  Now I know why she wasn't smiling.  If I had to work with that guy I would be sad too.  It has never been out of the norm at any grocery I ever went to in the past to get a pre-order for meat in 4 days before an event.  And, in fact, I called 2 other places and it was not a problem at all to get orders in so I have no clue what this guy's problem is but I do know I won't be having to deal with him in the future.  Bye bye Fry's on Shea and Tatum"}
{"text":"My favorite grocery store hands down since the remodel. Great selection of produce and almost everything else you need. They guarantee everything excellent customer service."}
{"text":"This is the coolest frys around. They have so much ready made food and pastries. Best place to go when you don't want to cook and need a quick dinner. The service is great and the covered parking is great. Does get pretty busy at times though."}
{"text":"This store was really really good before and after the remodeling.  Before it was just a nice basic grocery store, after it was a really special place. Since Mr. Flora died it is neither.... It is a simply VERY ordinary store pretending to be special."}
{"text":"Horrible sushi bar ! Bad customer service with rude manager at that independently own station Rice was not fresh and very salty rolls. I won't give them business again. It's not cheap so you better go to a restaurant for better service."}
{"text":"Employees are incredibly rude. Especially Brigitte at the register near the table area. She left her station and we waited there for a while. When she returned she pretty much rushed us as if WE were the ones keeping HER waiting. Then she started to talk to us very condescendingly. Like we were idiots. And got pissy when our number didn't work, probably because she typed it in wrong. Really made me not want to go back there ever. Sorry lady if you hate your job that much then quit. Don't treat people like garbage."}
{"text":"Wow, great place.  Much bigger than u thought it was going to be.  They have a Fred Meyer jewelry store in the front along with a US Bank and Starbucks and a cooking space.  Electronics section, garden stuff and garden furniture.  Oh, and they have groceries!  Get your milk and pick up a wedding ring while you're at it."}
{"text":"Love this grocery store! Clean and well organized. I can find pretty much whatever I need or want whether organic or regular products. I also like that the non GMO/organic products are in amongst the regular groceries. Check out is easy whether I go thru self- checkout or the regular lines."}
{"text":"Recently I went to this Fry's to get some groceries and also I had a custom order for meat. I wanted ground chuck 80/20 with a coarse grind. This is such a nice Fry's, I figured they would have no problem complying with such a request. I went to the butcher counter and asked for the above. Three times the \"butcher\" clearly ignored my request for a coarse grind. When he offered me the ground chuck that was in the display case, I asked him FOR A FOURTH GODDAMN TIME, \"is that a coarse grind, I want a coarse grind.\" He said he had to go in back and ask. He came out shortly and said, \"that's the way it came in.\" OK, you don't have any flipping idea what I am talking about and you don't care enough to ask me why I am asking for a coarse grind. You're just doing your job. I got it. Thanks. Why would I go here instead of Bashas'?"}
{"text":"Definitely the weirdest/fanciest grocery store I have ever been in. We just moved to this area and I feel like a Beverly Hills housewife when I shop here. Came here last friday night for groceries and I walked by people watching sports updates and drinking wine while I shopped for produce. There is also free valet, covered parking, car wash service while you shop, an area to take cooking classes, and a book section with a sliding ladder! This place is like a one stop shop!   Prices here are about the same as any other fry's. Look out for items on sale and the participating items for the \"buy 10 get $5 off\" deal. With sale items and our fry's card, we bought a ton of food for about $75. Nice to save a lot of money and feel like a million bucks doing it!   Oh and try the fried chicken, it's dellliiiicious."}
{"text":"Really bothered at the constant lack of selection at this store. Let me clarify, the selection is there, but the shelving is never full. We shop here 2x a week and spend copious amounts of money at this place. We have had to start grabbing things that they are \"out\" of and always seem to be \"out\" of at Circle K or Vons/Safeway. I got need for you, I am about to just shop at Vons/Safeway.   They are consistently out of aluminum bottle beer. There is a spot on the shelf for this but is always filled with glass bottles. We get told it's on order, but it seems to always be on order. My guess is that the merchandiser is too dumb to realize that FRYs filling the gaps to make the shelving look full. This is probably causing the merchandiser to miss something that is out. I find it hard to believe that a shelf that can hold 2-3 units is restocked everyday running the back room stock out.    The bag boys are god awful. I end up bagging my own $300-400 orders myself. I've worked at a grocery store when i was young. I get it. I know why they avoid the least desirable task. When they do bag it (two weeks ago) they put the salad and dressing from the salad bar on the bottom of the cart, upside down in the bag, causing our daughter to say that \"daddy ranch is dripping\" bless her heart, it was blue cheese, but still ruined all of my groceries and got all over the trunk--even after cleaning it up the best we could. Also there are no trash cans in the lot. So I had to walk all the way back up to throw it away.   The meat department sees to be out of several cuts of meat we like. There is a silver lining at the meat department. I do not recall the gentleman who is there on the weekends usually. I believe it is Loren or Lauren. He is an older gentleman but absolutely rocks on the fresh meat department. When we needed a few cases of king crab, large lobster tails, shrimp and salmon...He was the one who went above and beyond. He made sure we had the surf that we needed and even got the angus prime filet mignon and rib eyes the way we wanted.   One star added for him.  Apologies for not recalling his name, but I'm sure the store can figure it out, if they even give a flying heck. He will remember the visit, we offered him to come by and try some of the product. He even had us try some different types of shrimp that were sweeter etc. absolutely great recommendation.....Actually, maybe he needs a promotion to run this store and fix the problems that seem to be more abundant the last year"}
{"text":"This is one of the better Fry's in town. The produce is good & the staff helpful."}
{"text":"This Fry's is wonderful! There is covered parking, which is a hot commodity in the summer) pun intended)!!!  There are several little boutique type stores within this store- donut shop, hand dipped candy apples, cooking studio, froyo, olive bar, etcetera!  I took a vegetarian cooking class and it was fine- about $50 and we didn't actually do any cooking- just watching and socializing with the chef.   Definitely give it a shot- at least to try it. If you come during Halloween, there are cool, spooky decorations all over the store! Samples on weekends!"}
{"text":"Went back for the same \"crunchy\" roll I had last week.  Roll was great but the weird grocery advertisement over the intercom was getting on my nerves. Too many sounds between the intercom, tv, and music being played in dining area.  Did see that they offer cooking classes in a spiffy looking kitchen....need to check that out further.  They also need some recycling ambition for the dining area lots of plastic containers and cups being trashed."}
{"text":"Super awesome Fry's!!  This place has valet parking, covered parking, a car wash, water fountains inside, a sushi bar, a wine cellar, an olive bar, hot tortillas, a cooking classroom, and a cute Asian man yelling \"Riiiice caaaakes!\"   This is not your typical Frys....it actually reminded me a lot of AJs - the classy decor, the beautiful bakery and deli stations, and the food products you can't find at your normal grocery store.  Of course, unlike AJs, it also had the selection of a regular ol' grocery store...  But, I am wondering if this Frys is more expensive? I bought over $50 worth of grocery, but only saved $3 with my VIP card, usually I save quite a bit more. Maybe it was the sales that week, maybe it was that particular location - I can't be sure!   Super fun grocery store to visit.  Is it worth driving 11 miles out of my way? Not really.  Maybe if had a ton of groceries to buy or wanted to make an afternoon out of my shopping experience."}
{"text":"Wow. I never thought I'd be such a fan of a grocery store, but this is an amazing store. It's well-lit, well-laid-out, has the nicest staff in the history of chain stores, and has pretty much everything I want or need from a grocery store (except that it's not a Trader Joe's, but what can you do?).  Seriously...great, fresh produce...well-stocked shelves, huge selection of everything you want, great prices and even better sales (I bought a Thanksgiving turkey there for like $7 once--BEFORE Thanksgiving!). They also have an excellent pharmacy area, and even furniture and accessories, including area rugs. And grills and outdoor furniture!"}
{"text":"This Fry's has everything! But if you are on a budget, keep in mind it is the \"fancy Fry's\"- beware of marked-up prices! I always use a phone barcode scanner app when shopping at this store, just to make sure I'm not getting overcharged on the basics of milk, bread, etc. They have a huge selection of foods that you can't get in a regular Fry's, along with household items, a sushi station, wine bar, etc."}
{"text":"I shop here all the time as this is very close to my house.  It's huge, it's one of the biggest marketplace in Metro Phoenix.  They also have a shaded parking area but it's first come first serve and by the time I got there, it's all full.  They also offer free valet service.  This place is huge and you can spend a lot of time here.  This store used to be 24 hours, but they changed it because not that many people were shopping at 3 in the morning.  It's still good, but I wish they would open until late night maybe until 1 or 2 in the morning.  Good place, check it out if you are ever in the area."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE the sushi there! The store is very nice and has lot's of varieties to choose from. Excellent kosher section as well."}
{"text":"The first clue that this is more than just a regular grocery store is when you pull into the parking lot and notice the covered parking and the free valet parking. But then again, what do you expect of a store located right next to Paradise Valley where you're likely to run into a professional athlete, Hollywood star, or just a CEO worth a billion dollars or so?  Once inside, you'll see that this store has an amazing selection of produce, meats, cheeses, organic items and other groceries. But it also has a large section of home goods, decorations, bath and other grooming items, and other drugstore-type goods.  And the nice part is, that other than a few specialty items, you won't pay any more than you would at your regular Fry's.  So if you're in the mood to add a little luxury to your boring old grocery shopping, head over to this Fry's Marketplace!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love to come here and visit the sushi bar and Starbucks. Nothing better than having some refreshing sushi with a nice black iced tea. There is a little cozy sitting area next to Starbucks, love it."}
{"text":"Unbelievable combination of mass variety, freshness, fantastic prices, great staff and gas points to boot. Very impressed, especially with the deli department. Visit was 1/19/18 at about 6pm. The deli guy was very helpful and suggested the salmon plate combo. Just KILLER!! Unbelievable place and WILL return soon!!!"}
{"text":"I call this place the Narnia Fry's. It's so diverse and expansive, it's a bit like the old C.S. Lewis setting. There is a cooking school, a restaurant, a bookstore area, a jewelry store...you name it. Boringly enough, I typically swing by for the delicious salad bar. It's a bit pricey, but so good. The sushi bar is a good pick, too. The produce section is to die for, and the booze goes on forever."}
{"text":"The only dedicated grocery store in Anthem and it's a good thing everybody there is awesome. I've never had an issue with any of the employees there. We love shopping there and their prices are great"}
{"text":"I love going in here. The staff are soooo nice and helpful. They always ask if I'm finding everything ok. Huge store best selection."}
{"text":"Fry's really helped me out on a recent trip to Phoenix as I was able to get my natural healthy items that I live on back in Seattle, They had a great stock of Larabars, So delicious coconut milk ice cream and my Bobs Redmill Almond Flour for some snicker Doodles I was hoping to make. What really hurt was their Sushi. I had heard great things about the Sushi bar but when I got there I saw piles and piles of prepackaged rolls and nagiri. As I looked over the ingredients, there was nothing but Whey, Lecithin's more preservatives that do not belong in sushi. Sushi should be \"Fresh.\" I'm not a fan of conveyor belt establishments, and even less excited to grab a plastic clamshell ToGo box. Needless to say, I am still fending for a great place to grab Sushi while in Phoenix. HELP!!!"}
{"text":"Still a great store, but the wrap was horrible on the second visit. The rice was overcooked and did not contain any cilantro. The chicken tasted like it came from a can and then was boiled in dirty water. They had no carmelized onions either and it ended up being a tasteless lunch experience. At least it was only 6 bucks."}
{"text":"Walking this place is like walking into Willy Wonka's fairyland.  A million beautiful flowers?  Check.  A mile of produce, much of which I've never heard of (and I watch Iron Chef)?  Check.  Amazing sushi samples?  Check.  Samples of EVERYTHING? Check.  Starbucks, amazing deli, smoothie bar, olive bar, salad bar, cheese department, bakery, fresh cinnamon sugar tortillas... Yes, yes, yes.  Covered parking?  Yes.  Valet?  Yes.  A soda machine where you can put some cherry syrup in your sprite?  YES!  AH!  TOO MUCH!!!  Employees in the store always offer to help me.  Maybe they work on commission and think I'm an easy sell when I'm walking around with drool coming out of my mouth.  Who knows?!"}
{"text":"Had great experiences at this store. I've been there almost daily for the past two years."}
{"text":"Love this Frys....have shopped here for a decade. That said, I used to come here because they ALWAYS had baggers.  Not so much any more. The last three times I have shopped here I commented to the checker and all three acknowledged this and said they just don't staff them like they used to. My checker tonight said \"having baggers can make or break a store....it's a shame\".  Come on frys.  Get it together.  I have spent nearly $400 there in the past week and bagged 100% of my own groceries."}
{"text":"I agree with the first review... This is the best market in the area. I did see some organic or free range beef when I was there today. What I couldn't find was aged beef although the butcher pointed out that the premium steaks they had were at least 12 to 15 days old.  They really have a good variety here... and don't forget the sushi station they have. You won't find that at any of the other markets in the area. Their fried chicken is the best in town also. It is a quick dinner for a small price. They have low carb items that other markets in the area do not carry. This is my market of choice since moving to AZ."}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE coming to this Fancy Frys. The prices are so low, there is a cool beer/wine bar, deli has incredible variety and overall the selection is awesome. We always comment how great of it an experience it is to come here.  My only complaint is that the \"healthy\" section of food is separate from the \"regular\" section. For example, Kashi brand frozen items. We walked around the freezer section several times, searching and searching for them. Finally we accidentally stumbled into the \"healthy\" area - there was a whole new world of items! A little confusing. Plus, that layout doesn't really encourage people who wouldn't normally purchase \"healthy\" to try it. Would love to see it all together as I think in my head \"frozen food\" not \"health frozen food\" vs. \"regular frozen food\""}
{"text":"Love this Fry's! So clean... They have so much food! A bar! A food bar for quick take a way dinners. A home & decor/furniture section. I'm in love!"}
{"text":"This Fry's is the best! It's always stocked and you get through check out super fast. They are a busy Fry's and I think they handle their volume very well."}
{"text":"Today was filled with disappointment, errors and frustration.  I normally do not shop this store but will stop in when I'm in the area. The store is huge, has a large gluten-free section and I can stock up.  Well the store failed, the employees failed and I don't see a need to return.  yes the store has been remodeled but that does no good if the produce is rotten.  The tomatoes advertised on the holiday coupon special are moldy and covered in fuzz, when I asked the produce clerk if they had anymore- all i got was a shoulder shake, hummm I guess not.  When the bananas are over yellow and heading toward brown spots before dinner, again there are problems. The Udi's gluten free bread I purchased ($5.49 a loaf) has an expiration sticker of 5/18/2017 on it.  Sadly I didn't notice this until I got home and was making dinner,  I bought 2 loaves.  The store was out of many of the holiday coupon items and no clerks seemed to have answers or solutions.  I asked for paper bags, the bagger filled them with as much product as possible, jamming food and cans, frozen and delicate items all together.  The final straw was the delicate pastries turned ON THE SIDE to fit in the bag along with the milk and eggs. Obviously this store does not need my $150.00, I can get gluten free at whole foods, sprouts, a different Frys, amazon or several other places."}
{"text":"I love Fry's! This Marketplace is incredible. They have every product you could possibly need, a beautiful produce section, tons of fresh flowers, and the friendliest staff - especially at the meat and fish counters!   Today I ran into Whole Foods because I was on that side of the road, and I totally regret it! (Go ahead and check the difference in Yelp reviews.) There's absolutely no hustle in their staff's step, and the prices are triple. If that's what you're looking for, go for it. Me? I want to shop at places that speak my language: the language of customer service.   This will always be my preferred grocery store, and I drive past a Sprouts, Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, and Safeway to get here!"}
{"text":"Fry's fuel points has a trick to it - it takes $1000 in purchases in ONE CALENDAR MONTH to get the maximum $ 1 per gallon off.  if you make say $280 in purchases during a calendar month, the rebate is only 20 cents per gallon and the remaining 80 points are lost.  The discount is good for up to 35 gallons, while most cars only have a 14 - 18 gallon tank, and purchasing that much gas would require driving until the tank is empty, and then refilling.  Most people refill at a quarter or half a tank, reducing the discount to only about 10 gallons, or only $2.00, or less than 1% of the $280 in purchases.  Discounting gasoline in this way clearly encourages increased consumption of gasoline.  Customers who routinely use this discount are encouraged to purchase/ keep gas guzzling SUVs, the reduced cost of fuel makes it less painful to have a gas guzzler, and the large gas tanks in large SUVs and pickups increases the actual amount of the discount."}
{"text":"The pharmacy is horrible...The two teen queens that work there are beyond rude and Wayne Newton the pharmacist gives off a vibe of I hate this job. I called Fry;s pharmacy this morning at 9;10 am to make sure my med's would be ready for pickup today,,,I was told they would be ready at 1:30 pm...so i go there and guess what...not ready. Not worth the time to explain my displeasure with this place....btw med's were done at 3;45"}
{"text":"This Fry's would have gotten a 5 star if they didnt change their hours. that really disappointed me because this is my favorite Fry's grocery store. now they close at 12am =("}
{"text":"OMG! This place is a wonderland! On my first visit here, I stopped in to get one item. Once inside, I completely lost my mind! An hour later, I remember why I had come in the first place. One can get lost in here for hours.  Even non-shoppers are engaged!  If you go to this place, especially on a Saturday, go hungry. Let me repeat myself...DO NOT eat before you shop here! They have several food kiosks/demonstrations/sampling throughout the store.  They have a sushi bar, olive bar, salsa bar, wine bar, cheese bar, bread... (I sound like Bubba from Forrest Gump...\"There's pineapple shrimp, lemon shrimp, coconut shrimp, pepper shrimp...\") This place has a little sitting area in their book department...like a mini B&N!  There is also a jewelry, furniture, and home goods department. The place is huge!  Valet and covered parking is available. Have your car washed while you shop.  Talk about a SIGNATURE marketplace...  If they do not have it here, you do not need it! As you can judge by this, and every review, this upscale marketplace is tailored to capture the attention of affluent shoppers.  So...leave the drama at the door. No complaining or acting up when you walk over the threshold.  From organic foods, warm breads, bazaar meats, chilled wines, fresh sushi, and delicious desserts to best-selling books, patio furniture, cooking lessons, fine jewelry, shaded parking, and cheerful staff; it's here."}
{"text":"By far the best grocery store I've ever visited. We frequent the location for groceries, breakfast, lunch, dinner and more. Chef Gregg is phenomenal and can create fine dining quality custom meals to fit any taste. The elevate wine bar atmosphere is as relaxed as it is unique. The wine flights allow you to sample 50-60 dollar bottles for a fraction of the cost. Mike, Rene and the rest of the team at the bar are friendly and knowledgeable. Fry's is a true one stop shop and a huge benefit to anyone living in the vicinity."}
{"text":"I love this location of Fry's! Everyone in my group of friends calls it \"Fancy Fry's\" because it's, well, fancy! They have a smoothie bar in the store, a miniature library where you can actually sit down and peruse the books, and a starbucks. They have a \"foods of the world\" section, so if you're making a regional dish (japanese, british, middle eastern, italian), come here!"}
{"text":"Customer service is lacking at this location. Cashiers and bag boys seem to think holding a conversation amongst themselves is standard customer practice. To top things off their conversation was offensive. Manager seemed interested in what I was telling him when I reported the behavior but I doubt anything was said to the employees. Oh well too many choices in town to shop at no need to be treated poorly."}
{"text":"While visiting Phoenix on vacation a family member referred me to fry's grocery. The store was clean, organized, and fully stocked. When it was time to check out the staff were friendly and accommodating! I would go back to fry's for any basic essentials in the future."}
{"text":"Holy Shit I remember when this was Smitty's. For some reason all the middle school kids would go here and steal cigarettes. Everyone I knew got busted here.  Kids..... huh  Any way now its Fry's. I got to say it has a nice organic section but it is more expensive than at health food stores like whole foods.   They do have really great sales on organic stuff so I always check them out  Right now the best peanut butter known to man is being clearanced there.   Its called MaraNatha and it is amazing.   The only ingredients are peanuts and salt but the do a special grinding technique that makes the peanut butter semi sweet.   I left a jar at my desk once and kept eating it, I ended up eating 3/4 of a jar. I felt like a disgusting fat fatty. I felt pukey for like the entire day.  Anyway it is usually almost 6 bucks but its marked to 3.10 Killer deal!!!  Seriously try this stuff!!  If peanut butter is non organic they keep all the nuts in these huge silo's. It gets damp in there and causes mold on the nuts. They then hose them down with antibiotics. Yuck. That's why it tastes better organic too  They are made in smaller batches to prevent moisture and cancel the need for harmful antibiotics.  People sometimes have an issue with the oils separation, but you open it and stir it real good. Put it in the fridge and now it ll be evenly blended and for the rest of the jar no separation will occur.   Was this review about Fry's or peanut butter?"}
{"text":"The Deli area is always full of flies, not so clean. Some of the staff are quite rude. The area caters to mostly to older people (60's and above). I used to go to Safeway but they closed it down (Anthem)."}
{"text":"I love this store. Your experience starts out great with covered parking. The produce department is huge. They have a variety of speciality counters where you can order pizzas, smoothies, pizza, etc.. The bakery is fantastic but don't miss the caramel apple kiosk while drooling over various chocolate dipped items. They have also a cooking school and a wine and cheese bar. Don't forget Starbucks!  All this with the great selection, service, and prices that Frys is known for. It's a little out of the way for me but it is worth it!"}
{"text":"My dream grocery store- yup no joke. This store has everything from exotic fruit, wine bar...whaaa?!?)to a Cold Stone Creamery right smack in the front if the store.  Oh and I can never get out of there without grabbing some fresh rolled sushi- they have a huge selection and always have guys behind the sushi bar making it. Silly to leave a review about a dang grocery store- but this one takes the cake!"}
{"text":"Am I the only one seeing all the flies at the deli counter?! I really don't like this location. I always see flies, I can't get used to the layout, There's no Kids Korner, check out conveyor belts are usually dirty.  The location at 67th and Beardsley is awesome! Super clean, never saw a fly. Number system at the deli counter, Starbucks, and a  Kids Korner with stellar employees."}
{"text":"I call this place \"Fancy Fry's\" because it is a step above all other grocery stores. The only reason I lowered the rating is that they have free wi-fi that seldom works. When you report it, one of the managers made it clear that it was free and they don't have to fix it. I used to spend a lot of time there as I was tutoring, but stopped going when they couldn't keep the Internet running. I highly doubt they built such a beautiful area because they don't want people to frequent the food court area. They need to get their internet up to speed and make sure that employees know what to do when it goes down.  Most of the employees are terrific."}
{"text":"I love this Fry's location, it actually makes going to the grocery store fun. This store has it all, covered parking, friendly & helpful employees, and clean facilities. There's even a bar in the middle if you get thirsty. Five Stars."}
{"text":"I love frys and ever since they came out with their own gas stations it's just about the only place I go.  The fuel rewards are great and it's nice being able to pick exactly what discount you want instead of the full amount being applied at a circle k"}
{"text":"I hate this store. It's the closest to me so sometimes I have to go there. It's too big, too crowded, if you want to get some beer and chips, it takes 20mins. There is something wrong with the rush hour crowd too, they don't know how to drive and in the store they block aisles and seem to not care about anyone else but themselves. The only redeeming quality is the covered parking if you can get a spot. The car wash guys are great but are not part of Fry's. 3 places to get cheese spread throughout the store and they don't even have Cotija. My biggest problem is the lack of variety in products, which seems to be the case for all Fry's. I'm not talking about the breadth of product, I'm talking about the depth. For instance, I wanted to buy some orzo and could only find one brand. I know Safeway has at least 3 to choose from.  It makes it up to 3 stars because it's \"A-OK\" during non-rush hours, just avoid 4:30-6 during the week."}
{"text":"I started going here instead of Whole Foods whom i'll call 'Whole Paycheck\".  I like the Kosher area for kosher meats.  Although sometimes the kosher chopped beef meat smells foul. I think they should be more careful about making sure it's fresh. The kosher chicken is very good and fresh. The kosher stew meet is ok.  I also get the organic meats i like the strip steak.  I get the meets mostly for my dog as i don't want to feed her GMO death food. 95% of the food at these grocery stores contain GMO death foods in them. GMO has been proven to cause cancer in lab rats and they have started feeding it to the population since 2001 to lower population levels. The Illuminati cabal who secretly run this country want to exterminate most of the people so they have been putting chemicals in foods since Nazi germany to cause cancer and they have skyrocketed cancer rates from 1 in 10,000 people to 1 in 4 in like 100 years.  Most of the foods in this grocery store is too poisoned and i wouldn't feed it to my enemy or rat on the street unless i was evil.  All that matters to these corporations are money, they could give a rats ass if they cause most of their customers to get cancer down the road. The damage done by eating foods with chemicals and GMO don't happen right away, it could take 10 years for your body to start falling apart. First you get tired, fat, skin problems, migraines, stomach aches....then diabetes, MS, cancer etc. It's all caused by poisonous foods. Too bad not enough Americans are awake or have brain cells left to even care. Most will read this and think i'm nuts and go back to drinking their poisonous sodas and watch TV where they market eating poisons and make you believe cancer is natural and they don't know how people get it.  I personally recommend only eating from the organic section where it says non gmo.  All the rest should say \"cancer\" on it."}
{"text":"Fry's continues to sell rotten potatoes.  It doesn't matter that they are Idaho Russets, they are filled with rot.   When they redid the store, I expected them to up their game.  In my most recent purchase, not one potato was decent. People like inexpensive but we want value for our money.  No one I know wants to eat rotten food."}
{"text":"Aweeeessssooommmee I could live here! It has a living room, electronics, a full jewelry store with questionable customer service (previously reviewed). I can grab a cup of tea at Starbucks, take a nap, go have a wine tasting and then have sushi! Its awesome! There is a freaking Kosher section that has organic, kosher chicken. Oh and when I walk out I can pick my freshly detailed car up from the valet. Folks, people, countrymen ya'll don't understand me... this place is awesome sauce."}
{"text":"This is  the best grocery store in Anthem. It is very large, and clean. It has a very large area of produce, including a rather nice selection of organic produce. There is also a Starbucks inside. This is surely the largest grocery store in anthem and it always seems to be busy. I think this is among the better Fry's that I have visited and we have lived in Arizona for nearly 50 years."}
{"text":"I'm not ashamed at all... my review of this grocery store is all about wine. This store has a wine bar in it... did you know? Marvelous idea I say! The bar actually serves wine and tap beer. Several friends and I started going here monthly for a little get together as it as in a great location for us. It USED to be you could go and pick out a bottle of wine , pay for it and then drink it at the bar... you can't do this anymore. NOW the rules have changed and you HAVE to pay by the glass. Sucks a bit because now that affordable $15 bottle of wine will cost you $20. The process they told us is you can still pick out a bottle and bring it to the bar. They will then check the price of the bottle and using that price as a guide will then tell you the cost per glass. With this change in policy I bumped my review down from 5 stars.  A few other things to mention about this place is that it's HUGE! They also have a make your own peanut butter (or other nut butter) bar - pretty cool. The Bistro has some pretty good and affordable food as well. Plus, need your car washed? Get that done while you shop too. All it's really missing is a staff of teenagers to shop for you for a small fee... hey kid, here is my shopping list - do it all for me and I'll give you $20. Bring the cart to me when you are done... I'll be at the wine bar waiting."}
{"text":"This place has has really turned around. I changed my review from a 1 to a 5 star review. The produce area is amazing !  Being able to have a beer or glass of wine while you shop is a great concept.   However, I would rather they concentrate on their core business.  The produce section looks like something you would see in the deepest ghettos of Ukraine.   Seriously,  the shelves are always empty.  I asked the bakery guy about it and he said the bagels were always out by morning. Ok....but I was asking about the produce  section being barren and disheveled....probably not smart to ask the bakery guy :)  no matter what time of day it is, the produce section always looks like a third world country corner produce stand in a open-market bazaar.::: or what I assume a grocery store would look like after rioting just befonatural disaster...or the zombie apocalypse -"}
{"text":"Amazing.  I agree with someone above... if they don't have it--you don't need it!  This place is beyond the scope of your imagination. Everyone is friendly, the place is wicked clean and everything is just as orderly.  The car wash is for the OUTSIDE of your car unless you want a \"minor detail\" for $35... a full detail is $100. Even with the VIP discount (15% it is a bit steep).  And yes, they will load your groceries for you... but c'mon... are you really THAT lazy?  There is covered parking but don't let that fool you--consider it shaded.  Rain will still come through.  More seating than a restaurant scattered about... and YES... free wi-fi (which allowed me to upload pictures directly to Yelp).   Inside you will find: -- Starbucks -- Cooking school (classes vary, $25+ per class for adults only, $20 for kid/adult). You can partially register for one by just calling, but payment is expected ahead of time (2 days). See more and the schedule at: http://www.frysfreshattractions.com -- Extensive gluten free selection (dare I say better than Whole Foods across the street?) -- Lots of TVs -- Cheese bar  All in all, every time I come it is a wonderful experience. Everyone is patient, kind and attentive.  Plus, in my experience, the lines always go quickly."}
{"text":"I personally love this fry's - I think they are always professional, clean, helpful and polite. Whenever I need something or can't find an item, I am able to find someone who can assist me."}
{"text":"This is the Fry's next to my house but I also do give it 5 stars because it is clean staff is always there to help and with all honesty this is the nicest Fry's in the valley I remember when I used to come here that used to have valet services but I think they no longer have that"}
{"text":"I never thought it was possible to window-shop in a grocery store. Then I came here...wow! Beautiful store with lots to offer. Kept very organized and clean. Helpful staff. Carry some products and services not found at most other Fry's Marketplace locations. They've even got a cooking school. Closest competition to AJ's that you'll find in the Valley."}
{"text":"THis location is just amazing.  It is like a field trip, so go without the kids.  THey even have a wine bar :)"}
{"text":"This place is cool, huge selection of premade foods, alcohol and everything.  Its like a crazy mexican market but the majority of the food is actually edible, also they have covered parking and if your a real jerk valet.  Covered parking is cool, on the other hand valet is a bit obnoxious for a grocery store no mater how cool it is."}
{"text":"Dear Fry's Employee that works behind the pastry counter, I'm sorry I drooled on the window by the caramel apples. It is one of my few (okay, many) weaknesses. Sincerely, Tasia P.S. You're smart for having a window as a shield for that reason.  This location has everything! I believe this is their Flagship store for the Southwest. Not only can I valet my car for free, BUT I can get it washed while I shop! It sometimes makes me feel like I need to dress up to go grocery shopping here, but then I remember I used to bag groceries here when it was Fred Meyer and I get over my weirdness. Sushi bar, Starbucks (thanks for not helping my addiction), wine concierge, lots and lots of cheese, amazing fresh bread stand, etc. Seriously, you need to give this location a try, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I know this is a Fry's signature but it certainly doesn't feel that way. I have been to two other Signature Fry's one in scottsdale and one in paradise valley. This one is not as clean or organized as the other two.  I only ran in here to pick up milk on the way home from work. Unless it's a necessity, I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"The remodeled store is super.  Won't find fresher veggies or a better selection of meat.    They have it all, if you can't find it here....you probably don't need it.  Great ethnic selection as well.  Very attentive to service and friendly staff.  Covered parking, valet, car wash so your vehicle is happy too!"}
{"text":"I'll give them one star for the freshest produce in the area, and one star for all the fun housewares they sell. But that's IT!  Customer service is consistently HORRIBLE here! I've never encountered a friendly or helpful employee. I keep wanting to give them the benefit of the doubt, but after today's experience I have to give them a poor rating.  Checker didn't greet me as I walked up to him. OK, fine whatever. He scanned my card partway through the transaction, then at the end scanned the card of the man behind me. I mentioned to him that he had already scanned my card, but he just gave me a blank look. The bagger put my bag in the cart behind me and I grabbed it and yelled out \"excuse me!!\" and stated loudly that that was MY bag. Checker scans a few items from the cart behind me, I tell him those aren't my items. Another blank look. He totals the transaction and asks me for considerably more than my items were worth. I tell him I'm not paying that much for what I bought and after some discussion he finally figures out that the man in line behind me isn't with me. Checker gets very frustrated with both me and the man behind me, and he and I both state that we had both told him that we're not together.  Checker has to call a manager over to correct the transaction and they both are very short with me and the man behind me. Because it's our fault the guy is an idiot?? Checker continues glaring at both of us and with an irritated sigh keeps telling us how we're inconveniencing him.   No dude, sorry. It was YOUR mistake, and even if it hadn't been YOUR mistake, the customer is always right.  This is just the latest example of the awful customer service I receive here. I'll stick with Safeway and their mediocre produce and stellar customer service."}
{"text":"Oh.My.God. Have I died and gone to grocery store heaven? I think so. Fancy Fry's, as I have renamed it, is 20 min from my house. I refuse to go to the Fry's near my house and now drive out of the way to go here. Wine bar, valet parking, samples all over the store. SAMPLES ALL OVER THE STORE! I want to run outside and yell it at everyone that walks by. And the dessert bar, Lord! If you hate grocery shopping like me, Fancy Fry's will make it a much more enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Disappointed in the pharmacy, they started making things up about how they can only fill partial scripts due to high volume, but then he put his own foot in mouth and said dean was watching them due to errors. We were greeted at Albertsons with respect and great service."}
{"text":"Fry's rocks!  Especially this store!!  Sitting here on Valentines missing my recently departed husband and beautiful staff woman brings everyone chocolate covered strawberries!!    Way cool  I'd post the photo... Can't see a button to upload"}
{"text":"This is an amazing shopping experience.  I liked this Fry's before the remodel.  I like it even more now.  The previous reviews highlight the wonderful things about this location, and additions since reopening.    One of my favorite things they have here is grilled salmon in the area near the deli, ready to buy at around $10/lb.  Cooked that day, take it home, heat (or not) and serve over a salad.  I LOVE IT!  There are so  many other choices for that last-minute meal, less than going out to eat, still feeding the family healthy food.  There is such an amazing selection of services and foods, that one must visit to fully experience this luxury.  Employees are friendly and helpful.    If you need to grab something fast for a party, a potluck or the like,  you will be a star with any number of ready to serve offerings here."}
{"text":"I have loved this Fry's since it reopened last year.  I spend a lot of money here.  My last shopping experience was disappointing and frustrating.  I got home missing several items.  This is the 3rd time this has happened to me at this store.  When I talk to anyone in the store (most recently an asst. manager) about this there are no apologies.  All 3 times were like this.   A while ago, I purchased shrimp at Safeway and got it home to find it was spoiled, I returned to the store and the manager replaced double the shrimp and refunded my money.  Now, that's customer service. Fry's may offer good prices but you can't put a price tag on good customer service."}
{"text":"This particular location is very upscale.  Sort of like AJ's, only MUCH bigger.  Besides the usual stuff at Fry's Marketplace they have a wine and cheese bar, a \"wine cellar\", a small cafeteria, a sushi bar, and some really good breads (beyond the usual French bread and baguettes).  The cafeteria has some nice stuff.  When I saw them setting up for dinner they had prime rib.  They also had a cold food bar, and after you buy it you can go to a lounge with a microwave to nuke it!  I grabbed some stuffed chicken breast.  They charge $7/lb for all the stuff there (a tad pricey, but it was pretty good).  The fish counter had some really nice stuff (like ahi tuna).  I wish I lived closer.  Fry's prices on the general stuff, plus all these nice extras.  I would come here regularly if I did.  And covered parking!  Even valet, if you want it."}
{"text":"This Fry's is going downhill in service.  I am living close by and it was my preferred grocery store until recently.  I am considering using a different store.  My main complaint about this store is the lack of service when checking out. Since weeks I have to bag my own groceries and no help is in sight.  Not even the cashiers are helping!!! It would be so easy to scan and bag at the same time, but noooo....they just wait until you do it yourself. And I am not talking about a few items I bought...usually my cart is full to the top.  Now after weeks of adjusting to the lack of service I almost prefer to bag my own groceries because then there isn't such a waste of plastic bags & I can organize my groceries better etc. and no one just throws the stuff into the bags like they used to do.   On the positive side...the guys behind the meat counter & fish counter are the friendliest & most helpful people in this store."}
{"text":"Wow.  This is like a Fry's Marketplace infused with everything that is good and expensive at other gourmet grocers.  I've never seen so many different exotic fruits. Dragonfruit, anyone?  The bakery inspires the 5 year old in me to say \"Gimme, gimme, gimme! All that is chocolately, glittery, pretty goodness!\" Food allergies? Rest assured, you will find a wide selection of soy, dairy, gluten, and whatever else is popular these days- free food. Enough kitchen utensils to please Emeril. Wifi of course. Covered parking, now you're just spoiling me rotten. Fry's low sale prices-am I dreaming? I have to stop in every time I pass by, because even when I don't know what I need, this store has it!"}
{"text":"This store is pretty bloody amazing. I came here before the remodel and even then I thought it was kind of cool because I've never seen a grocery store selling furniture, but now it is just ridiculous.   I think it's best described as a combination grocery store, gourmet food shop and Target with an emphasis on food. Other reviewers have already mentioned all the departments which range from chocolates and baked goods (including a separate Ethel M stand) to a huge wine department to electronics and even books (set up like B&N). They still have furniture, as well as linens for your house. And if you need a diamond ring there is the Fred Meyer jewelry store too. I like how everything is set up in distinct departments which keeps it neat and organized.   The assortment is a little more extensive than a regular store, but you won't find a lot of the unique products you might see at say, Whole Food. And the covered parking is kind of silly though because it's just a roof on top and not a garage or anything. I guess every little bit helps in the hot Phoenix sun!"}
{"text":"Such a great Fry's probably the best one in the valley. Extensive kosher section. Prices are fair. The layout is beautiful and always clean. Employees are friendly. Wish they had a bigger organic produce section."}
{"text":"Just tried their sushi for the first time and the crunch roll was very good! Impressive for a grocery store."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I wish every grocery store was like this Fry's. Fruits and vegetables I've never heard or seen before. Love the deli area and all the wonderful meats. Huge alcohol/cigar selection. Can't go wrong when shopping here. And first grocery store I've seen with valet."}
{"text":"wow! way nicer than my ghetto fry's! this place has not only groceries (of course, laid out with a lot more pinache as well), but several lounge/seating areas, sushi bar, wine bar, car wash, a plant nursery, and even full on home goods and outdoor furniture for sale!  but this is a high tax bracket area so it's to be expected."}
{"text":"One star rating for the click-list. Grape selection was pathetic, not the first time we have experienced poor fruit and vegetable selection.  Stevie Wonder could do a better job picking fruit.  When I contacted customer service I got the same person that picked my rotten grapes.  She claimed they have no record of my purchase IT IS ORDERED AND PAID FOR ONLINE! They charge $5 bucks for the service and can't get it right, if they can't get it right then don't charge for the service.  And yes, I fully understand if they can't get it right, THEN DONT USE THE SERVICE,, we won't be using the service OR Fry's anymore."}
{"text":"I love to grocery shop. It's one of my favorite things. Even with a list, a trip to the grocery store takes me at least an hour because I am compelled to go up and down every aisle to see what new discoveries might be made. Therefore, you might think this would be a 5-star store for me.   But it's not. It's too much.   Even for me.   What's worse, going up and down every aisle is nearly impossible because the aisles go in every which direction.   Will I be back? Probably.   Is this a shopper's panacea? Not for me."}
{"text":"Just wanted to give a shout out to the Florist at this location. It is down the road a piece from my apartment and this is quite simply the best and biggest Fry's Marketplace in the entire state of Arizona....if not the Country. She hooked me up with a great corsage for my wife.....and I didn't give here many details except that I wanted Cali lily's and they had to be white. She asked me a couple of questions about my wife's dress and the rest as the say was history. I returned a couple of hours later and there was my beautiful corsage waiting for me to give to my beautiful wife.   While this may not be the cheapest place to shop for your groceries....they do have everything from the covered parking outside......to the free valet parking as well. Wine and Cheese bars.....to cooking class stations. Massive deli department......to massive bakery area. The aisles are spacious.....the self checkouts are a must try.....and the customer service is top notch. When your leaving they even have a Redbox for you to rent movies if your into that kind of thing as well. Don't let me forget what I started this review with......the Florist Department.....simply great and I will be back for all my flower needs in the future. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!"}
{"text":"nice store.  cover more of the parking lot and i'd give it a 5."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a dining experience at Fry's deli area you're better off going to an actual sit down restaurant.  Fry's \"dining style\" food in the deli area is very substandard at the best.  The seating area has comfortable couches, flatscreen TV's and DSL quality wi-fi.    The annoying part is having to hear the loud fan blower going off and on everytime the outside sliding door opens and closes."}
{"text":"I love this new Fry's concept store, there is so much to see and do here. Depending on what you're in the mood for, you can just do some regular grocery shopping or if you want something to eat for lunch or dinner this place can fit the bill too. They have a great hot and cold bar as well as made on the spot sushi which is not too bad for a grocery store. While you are here have a glass of wine and some cheese at the cheese bar or if coffee is your thing there's Starbuck's or try the juice bar the choice is yours. You can eat and relax in the bistro area, sit by the fireplace and watch TV or just dine outside and have a chat with a friend. What other grocery store offers all of this? Oh I forgot to mention the chocolate dipped strawberries that are available year round and the gourmet cupcakes where you can create your own combination or just grab some pre-made ones to go. I can go on and on but I think you get the point.   Other Perks:   Covered parking in the lot  Valet Parking  Mobile Car-wash while you shop  Fred Myers Jewelers  Ethel M Chocolates  Tortilleria  A Nice Book Selection  DVD & CD area  Gourmet Meat department (Dry Aged beef and Wagyu beef)  Gourmet Fruit & Vegetables available (check out the mushroom selection)  Nice home & housewares area"}
{"text":"So close...  I went in today with my mom to get some stuff we needed. Because that's what you do at the grocery store, right? Good News!! that is exactly what I got. Plus an unexpected political lesson, and a critical bag boy. So we had a good experience throughout the visit, but the check out experience was probably the worst I ever been part off. First we are putting stuff up on the belt and we hear the check out boy Brandon G was telling the girl checking out that he doesn't know how anybody could like trump. It shows how stupid your bag boy William is to agree and say yeah. That's when I was like \"This is going to happen right now?\" I just want Fry's to know how dumb their associates are. Not only are you talking about politics at work, but you're wondering how anybody could like Trump, in a state that voted him in. Not trying to get political on this, but that's a different kind of dumb. Obviously someone had to like him Brandon. So after all that happened they began discussing stuff that we bought, like we weren't there. I'm 6'7\" 245 pounds...how could you not see me? I'm huge...Again different kind of dumb... So, Brandon G and William what did we learn today? DON'T talk politics at work. ESPECIALLY in a customer service job. I did customer service for 4 years and the one thing we learned is to NOT express any sensitive topics with customers. DUH. DON'T discuss customers grocery's in a negative way. As a businessman, and a customer, that's a huge turn off. why would i want to buy something that you the the associate, don't like? So William and Brandon G, I hope you learned a lesson in customer service. If you have any questions refer to any customer service handbook ever made. You guys where awful. I will not be back, ever! Hope you're happy :)"}
{"text":"I'm trying not to dwell too much on what it says about me and my boring life(Grad School is KILLING my social life!) that I would get this excited about a frickin' supermarket but this place is AWESOME!!!!  I literally had to stop for a minute and take it all in. I've never been in a market with such a great layout. There is a strange, natural flow to the place that I can't describe. I NEVER write my grocery lists in any particular order but the layout meshed perfectly with my list. In addition to the layout, the cleanliness was also apparent and all of the fixtures are shiny and new.  Did I mention that they have a wine bar in the market and a very nice one at that? While this did earn the 5th star, there are plenty of other reasons why this market earns top marks from me. This is my new market and I am happy to drive a little further to come here to do my marketing from now on!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time after the remodel today and have called two people and texted one other about how beautiful and amazing this store is.   Tonight I went in \"real fast\" to get yogurt and toothpaste. I walked in and stopped as I thought, wow, they did a great job. Then I walked around the produce section... for 20 minutes. I was overwhelmed at all of the options and exotic fruits and veggies they carry. Things I haven't since since European and Spanish markets... it was glorious.   Since it was late I didn't see the meat counter open but would assume good things are found there.   Truly, this is the most beautiful store I have ever been to and I was nearly emotional as I walked around and took it all in. Such a blessing to live in a part of the world where this can happen and I am grateful for this Frys... who even says that about a duly grocery store?! I do!"}
{"text":"The new, if she is 'new',  she introduced herself as new, deli cook is AMAZING. They take things from the produce section and make wonderful recipes! The kale salad with watermelon radishes that most people don't know what do with, with this tarragon dressing, out of this world! And fish tacos,  and salmon with crab! And Parmesan potatoes and baby broccoli,  on a Friday night and have fun! Ty! She is the best chef...should be working at AJs if nothing else. We are lucky to have her."}
{"text":"I'm tempted to give this location 4 stars, but it has everything you could EVER want!  Between the smoothie bar, the sushi station, the jeweler and the chocolatier, how do you know where to go first?!  This place is a mad house on Fridays and Saturdays, so if it is your first time coming here, I don't recommend it.  But if you are in the market for a $900 bottle of wine AND you need patio furniture, a new dog collar and a loaf of white bread, this is your one-stop shop!!"}
{"text":"I love Fancy Fry's!!  Their floral section is unbelievable, they always have an amazing selection of both mixed bouquets, potted flowers and single flower arrangements are gorgeous!  I also appreciate the additional amenities they have - the wine cellar, sushi bar, smoothie bar, expanded cheese selection, etc. These keep me coming back!"}
{"text":"Awesome Grocery Store.  5 stars becuse they stock a few items that I could only purchase before online.  also..  their sushi bar rocks. seriously, compare their sushi to any of the sushi clubs.. errrrr 'sushi bars' around town.  In a blind taste test -- Fry's would win."}
{"text":"This Fry's is the crème de la crème of grocery stores in the Valley... It's not just a grocery store either... in addition to offering an incredible selection of fresh produce, deli, sushi, sundries, snacks, drinks, cleaning products, etc... there is a fabulous bakery, a Starbucks, cards, gifts, clothing, free wifi, and so much more.  All of that being said, I admit to working from this Fry's on more than a few occasions... and ordering birthday cakes from this Fry's bakery too.  It's a bit more of a drive to shop / order here, but it's worth it!  No matter what you're shopping for, this Fry's probably carries it... unless you're looking for \"Balance Bars.\"  They carry every other nutrition bar you could want.  Or if you're particular about Q-tip brand Qtips... they don't have those either.  But seriously, pretty much everything else you could possibly dream of is here.  Happy shopping!"}
{"text":"I tried Fry's new grocery service, and I'm never buying food the old way again. ... but not for the reason you think.   I have a problem.  When I shop for groceries I mosey and meander and buy things not on my list (I NEVER make a list).  Earlier this week I tried ClickList, which lets you order groceries online and then pick them up at your specified time and date and it helps me not stray off target.  I know how much I'm spending.  It remembers what I usually purchase, staples and it substitutes.  You decide which substitutes are allowable.  Jenni O turkey dogs in place of Oscar Meyer was a miss...  This service is great!"}
{"text":"The worst store ever, racist and won't help even if it is western union policy please please please don't ever go here"}
{"text":"This is one hell of a grocery store...if you can even call it that. It's more of a grocery mall.   They have practically everything here and they make it look good too. Is this a convenient and easy place for a quick stop? No, but it certainly is impressive.   Some of my personal favorites so far: -fresh bread from the bakery -quite the cheese selection -sushi made on the spot (Chris loves it anyway) -their produce just looks pretty (and tastes fresh) -the neatness and organization of the store -the premade fresh meals (chicken and veggie kabobs made for me!)  It's not going to be a regular stop for me (a bit too far from my place and a bit too large), but it certainly seems to have it all. Good work Fry's people."}
{"text":"I'm not one to write reviews on grocery stores, they are a need that we all have to fulfill, they all have items and stuff we buy and place in our house and depending if we are starving when we shop sometimes it's not good choices that made it to the house haha.   But this Fry's Marketplace surprised me, my only need for going into Frys was to pick up a bottle of wine, wasn't looking for anything fancy schmancy, after all I was picking up a bottle of wine from Frys, so I walked back to where the wines were at and what did I find? A chiller room for the wines! HELLO!!! I like my wine chilled!!! They had plenty to choose from; from the less expensive to even a $500 bottle of Dom Perignon this Frys had a nice selection of wines! I was impressed, what I had originally came in for was forgotten when I found a nice bottle of a sweet Riesling.   4 stars for the nice selection of wines, the chiller room and even a chilled case of wines!"}
{"text":"Stopped in this grocery store with my Phoenix friends before enjoying some time on the backyard patio. We picked up some fresh jicama, celery, hummus with herbs, and Pretzel Chips.  Store was clean and service was friendly. I even noticed in the produce department they had little Cuties (fruit) for kids to enjoy while shopping. And bags for the garbage. How nice!"}
{"text":"I love this grocery store everyone is so nice and friendly. I was welcomed by the manager Nick and personally taken to be rung up today talk about first class service. Love to be treated like a queen thank you so much. I always have a great experience when shopping at this store!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It has everything. The prices are seriously the best. My wife and I call it \"fancy Fry's\" because its very neat, classy decor,etc. it has covered parking, the quickest lines, and a wide variety of food stations."}
{"text":"I've ordered their beautiful cakes before, with the huge delicious roses on top. But just ordered one and paid too much for a small cake with very small roses atop! I think there star baker/decorator is gone!  Beware!!!"}
{"text":"Love fancy Fry's!  This was my usual location before the remodel, I was not happy about having to go to another store for 6 months but it was well worth it. This store has the best selection of anything you are looking for.  The staff is super friendy and polite.  I love that they often hand out samples like Costco, hope this doesn't go away after it's been open for awhile."}
{"text":"I won't be back.  There are too many other options than to put up with the treatment I received.  My first visit to this store was going very well until I went to check out and had a very rude, unpleasant encounter with a cashier named Toney.  The checkout lines were backed up, with exception of the express line with nobody in it.  Express states approximately 15 items.  I started to unload my groceries when the cashier loudly and rudely told me I couldn't use her lane, pointing to the item sign.  I had 17 items.  Yep, I'm a rogue!  I explained that all other lines were backed up and she had nobody at all in her line waiting.  This didn't sway her.  I moved to one of the other lanes and the customer in front of me pointed out the empty express line.  She, too, couldn't believe this cashier wouldn't wait on me!  We watched while Toney the cashier stood there with nobody in her lane, doing absolutely Nothing.  This is a POOR reflection on management, horrible customer service mentality.  Too bad, the store itself is nice... but who wants the aggravation?!?"}
{"text":"Service and customer experience drive loyalty and revenue.  This store has forbidden their butchers to do any custom requests, something as simple as grinding a roast into hamburger.  Perhaps Damian, the head of the meat department, or Lucy, the store director, or Corporate has decided cutting corners is more important than treating employees and clients well?  I like to know what I am serving to family and friends and you can't do that here.    Produce is as good or better at Sprouts, as is the sushi....and at a much better value.  Dairy and dry and canned goods are the same or cheaper at Costco.  Trader Joes has better niche products.  AJs has better meat.  And the butcher department at Safeway is happy to accommodate a simple request from a client.  The staff at the store is great but my buying power is going elsewhere because your value proposition just changed."}
{"text":"I've noticed quality of meat has devolved over the past year or so.  I just looked at a package of sirloin the other day.  In the smallest font imaginable the package read:  Product of Uruguay .........Not for me, I'll shop elsewhere."}
{"text":"Its a hit or miss with customer service here. Thankfully I've been shopping here since they first broke ground in Anthem so I have most isles memorized, I do avoid asking for help just because I dont know if they will be happy or annoyed to help me lol"}
{"text":"I love this hometown grocery store. Yes I know it's owned by Kroger's, a huge conglomerate, but it truly feels like my hometown store in the neighborhood. The people are always friendly and the prices are probably the best other than Walmart. I'll continue to shop here for years to come."}
{"text":"Thought I would go to the store early to beat the Saturday rush. I was wrong, the store was so congested and busy that it made shopping difficult. They also did not have enough lanes open for that kind of traffic."}
{"text":"This is a mega frys marketplace! Wine bar, restaurants and tons of other specialty departments! It is something that I had heard about, but just assumed it was a regular fries marketplace. This place is definitely worth checking out, especially if you just need to pop in and out for lunch at the buffet, or a quick glass of wine at the bistro after work."}
{"text":"Love this place! Has everything you could possibly need. Everything is super fresh. Chef Greg at the bistro station makes better food than most high quality restaurants at a fraction of the price. His station is an absolute must if you're there!"}
{"text":"Great!!!!!!  It's a Friday night. We think we will go to the super market and pick something up to take home. Much to our surprise-there is a bar, sushi station, deli area, bakery.   Had a gorgeous glass of white wine at the bar that has stunning granite counters and nice leather chairs. We get a cheese platter to share and nice beer on trap.  There was some light conversation amongst the other 10 guests; it was pleasant and civilized. Not like a loud and crowded bar. And to boot-all reasonably priced. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Favorite of all time. This grocery store has it all. Wine Bistro, Sushi Bar, Cooking Classes. If you want to see Kroger's/ Fry's Flagship store, this is the one! They have everything. Service is fantastic."}
{"text":"Don't let the pretentious negative reviews fool you, this is THE best Frys in the valley! They have the best selection of food and get all the new items right away. The fresh made food section is on par with Whole Foods, but better prices!"}
{"text":"Don't normally shop here, but when I heard about their booze sale...so there. (I swear I don't have a problem) I stocked up and I can't wait until their next big booze sale! yay for 12 steps!"}
{"text":"This is the fanciest fry's i have ever been to. you have everything you need in one stop.   Fun place to just go and hang out because there is a wine and beer bar here."}
{"text":"This is probably the most impressive grocery store I have ever been in. It's huge and so upscale. The liquor department is basically a Total Wine in itself. I love the layout. The bakery is amazing- try the fresh sourdough and pretzel buns. I'm sure the desserts and cakes and stuff are great too. Love the meat department specially the marinated chicken breast. Great selection of produce although some of the prices can be a bit high when there is not a sale (such as limes being 2 for a dollar... I'll buy them here in a pinch but other places have them cheaper). They basically have a full drug store here too which is super convenient. They have a juice bar Starbucks sushi bar prepared foods the whole nine yards. One could probably live in this store to be honest. The employees here are for the most part very friendly and helpful and make a point to greet you as you are walking around. As someone who spent 5 years working in a grocery store I gotta say well done Fry's!!"}
{"text":"Now, I don't know about you, but it's hard to be a fancy lady. Luckily, I can shop at The Fancy Fry's. Sure I might be in my sweats and I'll fight you over the last turkey, but at least this place has covered parking and complimentary valet service. Neither of which I've used, but it's the thought that counts. This Fry's thinks about me and my needs. Do I need twenty different types of cheeses? No. Am I going to buy twenty different types of cheeses? Yes. Fry's has got my back (and my wallet) and I'm okay with that. I love this Fry's.   You can get all your grocery shopping done here since it has many more items the normal Fry's but all at the same low prices. Plus, there's a wine bar, smoothie bar, sushi bar, omelet bar, olive bar, etc. all located within the store. I really love their huge cheese selection and can get caught up in the frenzy of delicious cheese and barely notice half my cart is gouda, smoked cheddar, and brie. (This has happened more than once.) I usually only come here when I need to do some serious shopping because I always spend way more than I would at a regular Fry's since there are so many options. Luckily, I can stock up on essentials and delicious extras.   This place is an experience and definitely one you should experience at least once. Even our out of town guests beg to be taken here. I know I'll be back - when I run out of gouda."}
{"text":"I love this Fry's!  It is by far one of the best marketplace stores in the Phoenix area.  They don't have gas, but they have a Tully's cafe, a sushi counter, and a large stock of furniture and patio items.  It is always very neat.  Never crazy busy in there and the employees are pretty friendly."}
{"text":"This store keeps changing- it's not nearly as nice as it was but it's also much better than when it most recently finished the last remodel. Pros/ good organic section and large selection of almost everything. Cons/ the produce isn't great and the people checking you out are always grumpy."}
{"text":"Manager mark refused to help with fuel points lost . Wouldn't roll over 100 points lost on last day of month  When it took 200 fuel points from this month lost 100 points since it didn't take 100 ending and 100 from this month . \" sad \" disappointing as they have helped me before? \" no such thing as can't it's won't!\" Tatum Bell store phoenix"}
{"text":"A grocery store.  I'm writing about a grocery store.   Really?  Yes, really.  What IS this place?  So bizarre. It's like the Epcot of Fry's.  You walk in and there is a lounge.  (see pics)  Big ol' leather lounge chairs, tvs.  WTH?  I was brought there by a friend who frequently hangs out at the wine bar there.  I make fun of her a lot because of this, but I am a good sport so I joined her.  Lo and behold there IS a cute wine bar there. You can get glasses of wine ranging from $4 to $7.  They also have a variety of beer on tap, cheese plates, and pasta, as well.    When I lived in Raleigh there was a French restaurant that had the most amazing white burgundy I've ever had. Except you couldn't buy that anywhere because the restaurant monopolized it.  Fry's had it!!    Would I schlep out here just to shop?  No. If I lived closer I wold for sure shop here.  It's HUGE and FANCY.You could park your car in a car wash area and it would be cleaned while you shop!    But if you are in the area, go to this Fry's. It's amazing!"}
{"text":"I live close by and come to this Frys because of the health food section. I'm desperately trying to find a store  that I can buy everything I need in one place. Unfortunately this Mecca doesn't exist.   I prefer Frys in general but his particular store never has what I'm looking for and the service staff is always rude. I mean, i get it, The life of a grocery store cashier isn't always glamorous and I know it's hard work. But it's not my fault your having a bad day.   From now on, I'll got the Frys at 40th and thunderbird and make a second stop at sprouts for my health food store needs."}
{"text":"I have to agree with some of the recent comments... the addition of the clothing and shoes took this Fry's location from great to feeling like a Walmart. I was hoping that this store would not add this like the rest of them did. I may have to go back to the Safeway at Camelback & 32nd St."}
{"text":"This Fry's is nothing short of amazing.  As other reviewers have mentioned, it is both upscale and MASSIVE.  There are many different prepared food themed stations, such as a juice bar, a sushi bar and a wine bar.  There is a walk-in refrigerated wine area and a studio kitchen that holds cooking demos.  The produce section even had a jackfruit for sale, although it was priced at $100, so I'm sure it was more for display than anything else.  The best thing about this Fry's, though, is that it helps you to avoid making multiple grocery store trips in a single day - I've wasted too many hours doing the Trader Joe's/Fresh & Easy, Safeway, Whole Foods trifecta just to find all of the groceries I need for the week.  This place has the prepared foods and specialty selection of Whole Foods, the staples of a normal Fry's or Safeway, and although it's not as cheap as TJ's or F&E, it at least doesn't burn a hole in your wallet like AJ's or Whole Foods.  Come and check it out for yourself - it's quite an experience!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this Fry's!!  Why can't the Fry's at the corner where I live be just like this one??  Why can't it also have a:  -bulk section where I can buy chocolate-covered ginger and coffee beans, and glazed pecans?  (Granted, the prices of these items are SIGNIFICANTLY higher than the prices at Whole Foods.  Yeah, bet you didn't see that one coming!)  -a lounging area complete with leather couches, a wide-screened TV, and an attached dining area with nice-looking dining furniture and hutches?    Even the gourmet deli, cheese, and bakery sections are \"jazzier\" than the one at my corner of the world!  Now if you'll excuse me as I'm going to have to visit my Fry's customer service to fill out some request forms..."}
{"text":"Ben shopping at this location for 10.5 years....way before the redo. I loved it then, so many markdowns and bargains. I still love it no but not for that reason. It's so fancy, lol:)  Love to shop there. Only draw back......annoying moms in that area.....Your wearing work out clothes and your to lazy to take your cart back!  Your in work out clothes!!! Take your freaking cart back- lazy @ss.........."}
{"text":"Overwhelming!  I feel like I needed a nap after taking a trek through this Frys' signature Market place. Even then name is huge :P  Foodie- If you cant find it , it dosent exist.    Hot spots- They have laid out this place perfectly, from the great wine tasting location right by the cheeses. The sushi stations.. its just perfect.   NameTags- The staff ,I'm sure, understands how overwhelming , and are super helpful!! The nicest group of people. I love that they hand out a map of the place right when you walk in cause YOU WILL need it! Dont forget to stop by the cooking class area and speak with the chef!  One down side- Other than just too many people, but its a new store, if you are shopping around with a cart and decide to stop for a wine tasting , there is no place for your cart. You know some places have a stroller parking spot, they need one for your cart.   Break it down- It the best thing ever."}
{"text":"You win Fry's Signature Marketplace. You win. -- Best. Grocery Store. Ever.   I'm not even kidding. This is the most magical \"grocery\" experience, I've ever had. I'm air quoting grocery because this place is so much more than just a grocery store.  The variety of offerings here... is mind bottling. For starters, the produce section... I've never seen so many different mushrooms in one place. Mushrooms aren't your thing?   Ok... go to the bakery. Enough delicious looking offerings to rot you teeth out of your face in 5 minutes. Huh? You don't eat sweets?   Ok... check out the area where they fill growlers with beer. Yeah, I said it. They have growlers and a little bar-esque sitting area where you can sample the beers they have on tap.   A salad bar. An olive bar. Deli. Beautiful floral area. Wine. Liquor. A jewelry store. You can even buy groceries if you want.   There are rows and rows of... everything. I didn't even have the energy to go through the entire store. I barely made it out of the bakery.   The store is clean. Aesthetically... well let's just say it's lovely. Absolutely the prettiest, most well organized store I've ever seen. Anywhere. On the planet Earth (I've never been to another planet).   If you've read this far and nothing has made you say, Like Whoa, I need to check this place out... Well... then I'm not properly communicating this Fry's' awesomeness, or we probably shouldn't be friends."}
{"text":"This grocery store is such a mind blow! with a wine and beer bar, amazing deli, in house Starbucks, fresh sushi, tapenade/ olive bar, amazingly fresh produce , a knowledgable and helpful florist, coin star, Redbox, covered parking, juice bar, caramel apple stand, book section, huge card section, latin section, kosher foods, valet parking, lounge area complete with leather couches and flat screen tv's , cooking classes, a divine cheese selection, a beautiful bakery with mouth watering displays, a diverse wine and liquor selection. If you don't fall in love with this grocery store... clearly there is no pleasing you!"}
{"text":"If I wasn't so happy with my neighborhood I would want to move so I am closer to this location. Oh. My. God... This place is huge. They have everything, but my favorites are the wine bar, sushi station and candy apple station. Fall is approaching and if you haven't tried one of their candy apples then you are missing out!!!"}
{"text":"I love the new look. I love the new covered parking. I hate though how the downsized their inventory. Yes, there is tons to buy, but with particular brands, one might not find a full line of the product forcing one to go elsewhere to buy. This use to be my one stop shop, but now I have to go hunting elsewhere for simple everyday items such as onion powder. Minced onion  I can find from small to large volume, but onion powder is only found in a small volume.  This is my one complaint for this location. Other than that, Fry's is my grocery of choice."}
{"text":"This Frys in Anthem is great.  It's very modern, clean, & well stocked.  They have tons of facebook deals that you can load onto your Frys card.  The gas discount is helpful too."}
{"text":"Considering this is like my second home with the frequency I am there, the customer service is always great however I am still getting use to the new layout!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed today!!! Cashier name tag said Stratton  No hello no worries whatever Then after I paid groceries sat there A min or two till I figured out Stratton  Was not going to bag them nor was a Bag boy who was next me  Bagging another customers groceries  The service there today was just Horrible"}
{"text":"I have died and gone to grocery heaven. This Fry's is unlike any I have seen in Arizona. It is chic  and humongous, but it is also well laid out and sectioned off. You could spend all day in many of the different departments or just run in and pick up a few groceries.   Starbucks Smoothie Bar Olive station Beautiful floral department Outdoor Garden Center Sushi Station Wine Bar Lounge Awesome produce section Jewelers and chocolate stations Tortilleria Gourmet everything you can image if you want to spend a little more (meat, seafood, cheese, vegetables, fruit).. And on and on  Covered parking Car Wash  Vallet Loading Assistance   And on my last trip I even saw the Easter Bunny. Completely awesome!"}
{"text":"I really like this Frys.  I live in the Phoenix part of 85086 and this was a new move for me so the initial lack of options was staggering and I was dreading getting used to the Albertsons on Carefree Highway.  I was very familiar with Frys and prefer it to Safeway as well, this was an upgrade from my last Frys.  That being said please do not go in expecting Fry's Signature as seen on Tatum and Shea, that place is not reality."}
{"text":"Wow I have so much fun going here! It reminds me of Wegman's on the east coast. I love the fresh foods section and meals to go. I am also impressed with their healthy food selection. I needed coconut milk yogurt and Fry's has it for cheaper than anywhere else I can buy it from. Win! They have a frozen yogurt spot that I want to try too.  Like, the swirly kind out of a machine. Also, a co-worker once bought my birthday cake from here and I loved it so much and haaad to know where he got it from - I thought it was a professional bakery!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to grocery store. If I need to run out for some eggs or something quick, I will come to Fry's. This location is close to my home which is why I come here, but is comparable to any other Fry's. I usually get gas here, too."}
{"text":"The planing and execution of this stores existence is superior. I love having this store in my neighborhood. However, the management and allocation of staff is horrible. I've been now over a dozen times and not once have i received anything but incompetent service. The deli host 4 young and inexperienced staff, doing about a third of the output it should. Same with the checkout counters. Slow, mistakes, and completely unkind. It is frustrating, having such a great store but managed so poorly."}
{"text":"Beautiful location! This Fry's has everything, food, pharmacy, books, electronics a Fred Meyers jewelry store, Starbucks and US Bank. Even covered parking!"}
{"text":"Always a pleasant experience whether I just need to pick up something quick on my lunch break or all my general needs for the week. The check out is always friendly, quick & best of all they actually use all if not most of their registers each day (unlike safeway who only has ONE). I also tend to use the self check out lanes on my break which really help me get in and out, very easy to use & always have an available tenant. They have the best deli in Anthem by far! Always fresh sandwiches, meals, or just sides. Fresh ingredients that you can tell they take time and care to make. Enjoy getting their fresh cut fruit as a nice snack for the day! Every single person behind the deli is always very personable and have great suggestions. The store is nicely organized and pretty easy to find whatever it is you need. Can't speak for the pharmacy as I always go to cvs. Very happy with my experience at the store, can usually find a good deal or at least a few popular items on sale. Will continue to shop at this location as my main grocery store."}
{"text":"I will drive to this Fry's every chance I get!  This is the Grand Daddy of all Fry's stores!  YES!  It's got covered or valet parking, they'll bring your groceries out to you curbside, they'll even get your car washed while you shop!  The bakery is to die for but unfortunately they make nothing gluten free.  They have whole bars of ready made dinner type items.  The olive bar is massive as are is the sitting area near Starbucks.  Leather and massive yummy chairs.  I jokingly said to my Mom that I might start hanging out there all day with my laptop.  Seriously.  Seriously that nice.  The whole store has wide aisles, massive choice and excellent customer service.  Gourmet chocolate, why yes.  Organic section?  YES.  A jewelry store, bank and a huge area of home accessories and furniture items.  Clean, well lit, flowers, odd fruits, cooking classes.  That too!"}
{"text":"OMG This Fry's is a DREAM come TRUE!  This is how I want grocery shopping to be!  Holy goodness, I could live here...  Ok, so this is one of the flagship Fry's stores, and has everything.  When you pull in, theres free valet (im sure you have to tip though) and covered parking.    Customer service here is awesome! I had a girl unload my cart for me at the check out! Who does that?  Loved it!!    They have a sushi bar here, FULL deli with lots of premade dishes and plenty of meats, cheeses and breads.  They have a full wine cellar and hold wine tastings as well.  I checked out the wines, and they have everything!  They have your typical $20 bottle, all the way up to a $400 of red wine.  Nice!  I was also thrilled to see the nice selection of Kosher items here as well.  They even have a cooking school.  Totally worth going here.  Make the time to do the drive because this is how grocery shopping should be!!"}
{"text":"Fry's Bistro Pizza   A delicious experience watching your pizza made from scratch. The dough is put on a plate that scooooshs the dough to a nice round circle approx 10 inches. Then you pick what toppings are on it. Then placed in the oven.  It takes approx 3 minutes to cook and what awesome piece of culinary art. Tyler made the pizza to order with a smile and explaining the process. A custom pizza too look kewl.   The pizza was soo delicious can't wait to order another."}
{"text":"Jesse Jessie jessy,  the manager, unsure how he spells it, 100 % good on phone. 0%  on follow through and follow up. Thanks for nothing and not of any useful help."}
{"text":"Wow was about all I could say when I heard about the new store... then when I actually checked it out I had no words. This place is incredible.   Valet, concierge, wine tasting, cooking classes, sushi counter, deli, tortilla factory, wedding cakes, exotic fruit, aisles dedicated to foreign cuisine, great prices, a giant bread slicer so you can pick how thick you want it, awesome cheese section... I could go on and on. The best part about having all of this under 1 roof, they are still inexpensive Fry's prices. They do not jack up the price just because it is a nice new fancy-shmancy store.   My first exciting moment in my adventure was the cheese counter. They had these amazing little cheese plates from a specific country (Spain, Switzerland, France and so on) with four small cheese teases with some nuts and berries. Amazing! AND if they don't have any out in the case, no prob, just ask and one of their cheese specialists will whip one right up for ya.   \"Where did you get your Wedding Cake?\" \"At Fry's\" could be a conversation someone might have, and they looked beautiful.   As most grocery stores have these days are a Starbucks, but do they have a lounge area with flat screen tvs to go with it? Nope, but this Frys does. So comfy and inviting so those who choose not to follow their loved ones around the store for hours or just get lost and need a moment to collect themselves.   Oh did i mention that the butcher will even grill up your steak for you right there at the meat counter? Incredible.   OK I am getting a little carried away about this place, but seriously you have to go check it out for yourself. Oh and try the chicken salad in the deli department and the cheddar blue cheese in the cheese section. They will change your life!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I stop here because of the fabulous wine bar, starring the fabulous, knowledgeable, personable Laurel. This wine bar compared to others in Frys I've been to is the best. It's chill, Lauren is engaging and educated on the wine they're serving, and enthusiastic in a low key way that makes you want to know more about what you're drinking. Can't wait to be back."}
{"text":"David is the best! When my daughter was five she  would always run up and hug him. 10 years later she still gives him a hug. He is always a joy to talk too, and so helpful."}
{"text":"I like Fry's the most out of the stores in the area because their produce seems to be the best. However you really have to watch the expiration dates here, I have purchased expired milk twice ( I know, the expiration date is something you should check before you buy, but with a 15 month old I can't always study milk) and most of the bagged salads expire the next day. Not sure if this is a management issue or an AZ thing, but selling 4 day old expired milk is not cool.  It's milk for a baby too, so that makes it even worse, right? Cute little babies deserve fresh milk! This is America. So, check your dates, Fry's, and tell management that's not the area to save money in. Then, I shall love you."}
{"text":"I want the old Fry's back!! something has changed in transition. My husband and I have shopped at Fry's for more than 13 years. We'd even go out of our way to shop here but no more.   Our main complaint is the customer service (or lack of). The friendly, helpful staff has disappeared. Where did they go? Who brought in the second stringers from AJ's? Grumpy is not attractive. Though I must give the Sushi folks credit for enthusiasm and free samples.    The layout of the bakery and deli departments is so crowded we avoid that area completely. The aisles seem more narrow than before.   We now hit up Albertson's, Bashas and Costco.I am sad to lose my good old Fry's!!  We'll pop in once and awhile to see if by chance things change."}
{"text":"Nate the cashier is very rude . He chooses to only speak to the Caucasian people in the store including my Caucasian daughter but refuses to speak or even acknowledge me. Have spoke to management about it but now going to speak to corporate ."}
{"text":"I was told by a wine vendor in one of the other Fry's stores that this is the only \"Signature\" market in Arizona.  That is actually not true, there is one in Anthem that I'm aware of, so maybe there are others as well.    No matter, it is unique.  No shopping experience matches it.  I drive to it from a ways away when there is serious shopping to be done.  If all you want to do is dash in and grab a gallon of milk or a loaf of bread, the corner grocery store is better for that.  THIS store is an excursion.  It would be even if all you did was wander the aisles and admire the broad selection of items available in every category!  My family has health issues requiring particular types of foods that can be challenging to find in other neighborhood stores.  This Fry's has an amazing array of choices.  I also appreciate the selection of loose leaf teas and the ones I have tried are very good.  EVERY grocery store (almost) has whole bean coffee any more, I've never been in another one that carries quality loose leaf tea!  Cooking classes?  yeah, they've got that. plus all the other specialty items mentioned in other reviews.  I've even met someone here for a business meeting because of the plush coffee shop environment.  I know that free wi fi isn't much of a novelty any more, but it's nice to have for that meeting.  I've never encountered any grumpy employees, every staff person has been friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"In Phoenix for thanksgiving vacation and stopped for grocery items.  I was very impressed with the deep selection.   Also the fruits and vegetables were of the highest quality."}
{"text":"This Fry's is pretty cool. It's really big, has lots of interesting fruits and veggies and has a really cool cheese counter area. The hubs and I like to go here once and a while on Sunday afternoons for a change of pace :o)"}
{"text":"This is a great addition to our community. Love that you can get meat grilled right there at the store, always friendly employees and a great selection of \"extra\" products and services."}
{"text":"If every Fry's was like this one I'd frequent them more often.  Between the covered parking, bulk selection, and good prices I personally think they are better than the Whole Foods down the street for staple items and while their prices are higher for some of the esoterics that actually helps in my case to prevent me from buying more oils, vinegars, spices, etc that will sit in my cupboard indefinitely.    Employees are friendly, the store itself is nearly spotless, and it is within walking distance of my current residence.  No complaints.  None at all."}
{"text":"OMG! Always shop Fry's but this store is incredible & I can't believe I did not know about it! Everything you can imagine in a store, fresh food, wine bar, furniture, ready to eat food with beautiful spots to sit down & eat.  Leather couches to sit & drink coffee. Covered parking!, get your car washed while you shop! This is now my go to store!"}
{"text":"Where else can you grocery shop, drink wine, relax and get your car washed... Frys!!!  They have done this store up right.  I love it here.  The winebar is amazing and a well kept little secret.  I go often to meet up with friends and enjoy wine and food.  Sit down, order a glass of whatever is on the menu for the price you would pay if buying it by the bottle.  Or, just buy it by the bottle and drink it there.  Glasses are clean and sparkling.  Feeling hungry, just get up and get whatever you want, break it open and eat it with your wine.  Or, order a pizza, they bring it right to the bar for you.  Want water, get up and get one and bring it back to the bar.  When you are finished, bartender will ring you up.  Then, go shopping!!!  What a concept!  Even though I no longer live close-by, this is my go to wine bar.  Did I mention, the air conditioning is cranked so where else would you be on a hot day?  Two people-4 glasses of wine, two bottles of water, a pizza, a brick of cheese and crackers, $32.  I can't do it at home for less, of course not, it's a grocery store!!!"}
{"text":"It's not a grocery store, it's an experience. Presenting, Fry's: \"The Experience.\" (Check out my pics, you won't believe your eyes!)   The words \"grocery store\" or even \"marketplace\" don't come close to describing this place. It's more like a Disney Grocery Land.   Before you even walk in the door, you'll see free valet parking, car wash, and covered parking. Walk inside directly into an over-the-top floral department. Looks like something out of a Donald Trump wedding. There's a tree with twinkly lights and oodles of gorgeous fresh flowers. Look to your right and you'll see the cooking school. You can sign up for a variety of classes, at reasonable prices, taught by local chefs. Keep walking and you'll be in the produce section, actually more of a world's Farmer's market. It has the usual produce, of course, but also unique items such as shitake mushrooms ($50 per pound), blood oranges, kumquats, and miniature pineapples.   But the beauty is, they also offer regular apples, oranges, mushrooms, etc., at competitive prices. It's the best of both worlds, competitive traditional foods with availability of exotic items, should you wish to indulge. That same concept extends throughout the store.   Naturally, there's a wine cellar, but can you believe they also have a large wine and cheese tasting bar? And then (drum roll please) there's the bakery. I think I could live there. A normal selection of breads, cakes, pies, and pastries are intermingled with high end and artfully presented confectionery masterpieces. There's a tortilla factory too, you can watch them being made and sample them while they're still warm.   But wait, is that a Cupcake Shoppe? Yes, can select your cake, filling, frosting, and toppings and they'll assemble you very own customized cupcake while you wait. The candy counter is mesmerizing: chocolate dipped strawberries, caramel apples, chocolate dipped marshmallows, the list is endless.   Okay, admittedly, I've spent too much time on the sweet treats, but it leaves me spellbound. The meat, dairy, deli, prepared meals, seafood, frozen foods, canned goods, and international foods are available in vast and varying supply. Gees, there's even an entire section of the store called the \"Kosher Experience.\" Plus, the pet food aisle contains a refrigerator stocked with fresh meat / dog food, should you decide to pamper your pet.   This place is amazing and is worthy of a full day school field trip. Heck, it's worthy of an adult field trip. Even so, I want to stress that normal grocery items are sold here too and at competitive prices. It's a win-win for the customer!   As you'd expect, there's a pharmacy and a bank within the store. But would you expect a jewelry store? Yep, if you so choose, you can buy a diamond ring as you're checking out of the grocery line. That'll give you some added bling when the valet pulls up with your freshly washed car and helps you load up your groceries."}
{"text":"This Fry's has all the superficial bells and whistles (size, covered parking, sushi, wine...), but lacks heart and follow through. My spouse actually drives out of her way to the basic Fry's at Thunderbird and 40th Street just to avoid this Fry's clutter and higher priced selections. Nearby (smaller) Trader Joes and Albertson's are also preferable in our view. We would also rather support local shops and restaurants for our specialty/gourmet food needs.  So what motivated this review? A cake. A stale cake. A stale birthday cake. A stale birthday cake that was cute, but much more expensive than comparable cakes at Costco or Albertson's or Walmart. Yes, Walmart, the discount purveyor of soft and moist cakes, unlike those sold at Fry's. Thank you Fry's for nearly ruining our party. Thankfully our guests were great. Chill. Of course that's why they were invited. Still, the kindest thing said about the cake was, \"It wasn't so bad.\" But it was. How can this happen? The cake was picked up an hour before the party. Baked fresh, then frozen, then thawed, then frozen... I suppose. Stand alone, the bakery deserves a negative star rating. No more Fry's baked goods for us.   FYI, the birthday party was nearly three weeks ago. I hate Yelp reviews written in anger over a single incident, so I waited a bit to write this one. You should have seen the first draft of this review :) The final draft was written, however, with years of experience at this store and its predecessors in mind. Thus, two stars rather than one."}
{"text":"One of the best grocery shopping experiences if you have the time! The store is very big and the options are overwhelming, in a good way. I like to call this Fry's the \"Fancy Fry's\" because it has everything from sushi made on the spot to endless selections of wine, beer, and alcohol.   They also have an incredible bakery that makes custom cakes and homemade tortillas! Not to mention delicious pretzel bread rolls that I grabbed on my venture in there last time.   The butcher has fine cuts and a plethora of seafood, more than your average Fry's. I could go on and on about the different selections but you should pop in there and check it out for yourself.  Don't forget to look at their home section!   Last time I was there I was astounded by the variety of mushrooms they have...I love me some mushrooms and they had so many types! One of their produce guys, I wish I had caught his name, was very helpful and talked to me about some of the stuff they get during certain seasons and I am so excited to go back and find myself some Lobster Mushrooms."}
{"text":"This is a grocery store like I have never seen before! Valet parking or covered spaces for those that park themselves. Once your inside you almost forget you are in a Fry's. Feels more like a high end whole foods or AJ's, but still with Fry's prices. Too bad it wasn't closer to home. I wouldn't mind filling up my cart here more often."}
{"text":"Went on a perfect day to shop... Superbowl Sunday, after the game already started.  It was like my very own store!  I had heard this was the mother load of all grocery stores in Phoenix, so I spent 2 hours in there.  Just to get the feel and lay of the land.  LOVE IT!  Besides doing all my grocery shopping, I will point out the cool things about this SIGNATURE MARKETPLACE.  Covered parking with the option of valet and having your car washed while shop.  Pretty cool.  Great furniture selection.  Seriously.  Saw a desk and shelf set that I think I have to have.  There is a wine bar inside.  With stools, a TV and a bartender.  Smoothie Bar- yum!  Bakery is out of this world- attentive staff to help you make selection.  A large variety of bakery items and breads.  CARB HEAVEN!  There is a mini whole foods inside the store.  A mini bed bath and beyond as well.  And a mini best buy.  I love it.  I can't wait to go back.  The fruit and veggie section is gorgeous too!"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite Fry's!!  I prefer to drive the extra miles to shop here because this store is consistently clean, well stocked and adequately staffed.  This store has a terrific deli department where the staff presents your deli order to you neatly packed, as opposed to the Tatum & Bell location where the sliced meat is just sloppily tossed into a plastic bag and then handed over to you looking like some kind of big, crumble up wad.    I also truly enjoy this store's garden area, as well...a great variety of healthy looking plants at a good price.  (Store garden departments appear to be a dying breed these days or else aren't well maintained, left with dying plants right on the shelves.  NOT so here at this Fry's...again, kudos on keeping up the garden section!!)    This store is also excellent for having more than enough Free Friday downloads available no matter what day of the week I go in, again unlike the Tatum & Bell location which appears to be out more often than not.  (Very inconvenient when that happens, but I've never run in to it happening at this store, so it makes shopping simple and effortless.)  My experiences at this store have consistently been satisfactory or higher and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it."}
{"text":"I love how I can stop and have a glass of wine in the middle of my grocery shopping. That is all!!"}
{"text":"Enjoy our weekly shopping trips here.  My husband loves to cruise the meat dept. while I love the produce!  Since the remodel, things are still a might hectic, but everyone is super nice and helpful.  Love the gas credits too.  Since we qualify for Senior Day-we take advantage of the extra savings, the cup of Starbucks and the treat."}
{"text":"This is a State-of-the-Art Fry's Marketplace that provides everything you think you might need...and more!  There is a gigantic Kosher foods section titled \"Kosher Experience\", opening Jews and Goyim alike to delicious Israeli and Glatt Kosher foods.  This Fry's doesn't discriminate.  If you want to be a fatass, you can spend hours shopping at the snacks and soda sections!  If you're passionate about all things organic and vegan and whatnot, it's right in the front so that your anorexic self can prevent yourself from fainting on the journey to the center of the store.  If you live off of TV dinners, this is your place!  If you want a fresh snack to eat, you can get it here too!  Do you like samples?  Fry's will let you sample one of it's weirdo experimental salads (Grape salad??) to try.  Sure they aren't the best, but hey, they're friggin' free samples!  Do you want to buy a whole loaf of bread and don't want to cut it yourself?  They have a BREAD CUTTING MACHINE that you can use!  What is amazing about the Shea x Tatum Fry's--a serious gem of a Fry's, an oasis, a beacon of hope--is that the low prices Fry's is well-known for doesn't change one bit!   I can't go to this Fry's without spending at least an hour and a half in there.  It's worth it because you can get gas rewards for shopping there.  The manager's specials actually help you double the points because you're willing to risk your life to buy almost expired food for 1/3 of the original price.  They reward you for your ability to take risks.  Can I get a hallelujah!???!?!??!  FIVE STARS!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love Frys. The employee's are very nice and Debbie the post office/customer service employee is nice, she may look like a bitch but she's not. Just don't piss her and you will be fine.  I moved from Scottsdale while rennovations where being done, so this review is striclty prior. The meat department has the best cuts of meat, the deli is connected to the hot ready to go food. The whole store looks classy.  You have the liquor, beer and champagne section together next to customer service."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Fry's Marketplace! It has everything you could ever want from a grocery store. I enjoy the Deli Station where I can place an order for all of my Deli meats and cheese I need. It is ready in 15 mins and sometimes is even quicker. I shop for my produce and by the time I get to the deli my order is waiting for me.  Another amazing quality about Fry's market place is their bakery. It is amazing. They can pretty much make you anything you need. I have worked with Kathy the baker on many occasions. Kathy is always very nice, helpful and so creative.  I have order about 10 delicious cakes from her over the past 8 months. We just keep coming back!  I can find everything at this store and everyone is so friendly. Also, I have the Fry's app and I am able to download digital coupons straight to my card, track my gas points and make grocery lists.  Check out is always quick and easy. I highly recommend shopping here!"}
{"text":"Thank you Fry's for having more organic options. Bought some organic eggs, organic oatmeal, organic Fuji apples, and organic mozzarella cheese today."}
{"text":"Wow.  I usually have a good experience at Fry's Marketplace stores, not so this morning at the 4707 E Shea Blvd, Phoenix, AZ location!  I had four employees in different sections of the store be completely rude to me.  I asked a question of them, and was given a real \"you are bothering me\" type attitude.  At the end of my visit, I needed help with the self checkout, and no one was in sight.  I tracked down someone walking by, asked my question, and got an actual eye roll of disapproval!  He just walked away... Then I asked someone else, and she just grabbed the items out of my hand and started to ring them up really fast.  I said, I just asked for instruction on how to do this myself, can you show me?  She replied \"There's no need to say that!\" in an annoyed way.  Employee at Starbucks was rude as well, wouldn't even look at me or say hello.  Is everyone so stressed out at this location?  The management really needs to hone in and retrain the employees on how to speak and assist their customers. We are the reason they have a job there. I don't expect employees to be my best friend, I just expect them to be polite and helpful.  Disappointing for sure.  I sure don't feel welcome at that location, and won't be going back anytime soon!"}
{"text":"This is the queen of all grocery stores.  It puts AJ's and the upscale Safeways to shame.  Covered parking.  In and of itself may be enough to get me shopping there exclusively in the summer months although I'm sure they can be hard to get in the summer months!    They have the shorter two level carts which are much nicer to use than a basket or the traditional cart.  Extensive this that and the other thing in everything.  And a lot more of it.  Every cultural food you can think of, then some more.  Wine cellar and bar, sushi bar, lunch counter, deli counter, flowers all over, even a bedding section (and I bough a quilt set today, it was too pretty and nicely priced to pass up).  There's even a jewelry store.  I didn't see a day care though, wouldn't that just put it over the top!?  Valet parking and car washing is available while you shop.  Really.  This is not for those in a rush to grab something fast and go.  The upscale design and layout is casino like in i's intent to trap you in mazes of plentiful aisles.  Best not to make your first trip in when you need to get in and out quickly."}
{"text":"Love this grocery store.  I usually never shop at Fry's and shop at Safeway, but this is the ONLY Fry's store that I will go to.  It's fancy and always has items that you wouldn't normally find in a regular grocery store.  We usually only come here though for the pastry department....and the fresh sushi.  There's a sushi roll there that we always have to get when we stop by and it never fails us.  For some reason, I can't remember the name, but it's basically a california roll with some mayo spicy sauce drizzled on top.  The guy who stands there and yells out \"fresh sushi\" could take a break though, his voice is annoying.    Anyway, my review here is for the pastry department.  We have ordered our sons birthday cake here for the past 2 years....last year they were cupcakes with angry bird rings on top.  Delish!  This year, we ordered a quarter sheet white cake with whipped cream topping using their Despicable Me theme of Minions on the cake.  The cake turned out the exact same way the picture did.  We were impressed - and more so, we were so impressed by the taste of the cake.  It was so good!  Our guests also asked where we purchased the cake.  So kudos to the pastry chefs at the Fry's on Shea & Tatum!  We'll definitely be coming back.    There's also some limited cover parking which is great for those super hot days - but expect to drive around if you're looking for a spot.  And they have valet, too, for the super lazy. They also will wash your car for you (for a fee) if you want, while you're shopping."}
{"text":"The grocery store is amazing but the pharmacy really needs to get it together. Every time I go there I run into issues but they don't care to tell me the issues until I come back to pick up my prescription. I waited 30 mins to come back and find out there was a computer error I was then told 15 more minutes to find out that they didn't have either of my prescriptions. What were they doing for 45 minutes?"}
