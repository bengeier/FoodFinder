{"text":"Goat and polenta was awesome and so was gnocchi. Loved it!

Pizza looked great- will definitely like to try that out next time. Free sparkling water for the table. Nice vibe inside. Wait staff was attentive. We ordered a few things and they coursed it out which was nice."}
{"text":"The front of the house, i.e. reservations by phone and seating et cetera is efficient and responsive. You can actually talk to a pleasant and understanding human being, a rarity these days and definitely an asset.

The restaurant is in a long rectangular room which I suspect is quite noisy when full, which it normally is at the moment. We would recommend the chefs bar, which has stools with backs to them and enables you to watch all the skilled preparation of the food going out of the kitchen. The interaction can be fun too, particularly if you pass over a glass of wine or two.

We had the octopus which is whole - not just a large tentacle but a complete small octopus and is outstandingly grilled on open flames, with a small amount of mint pesto on its arms and a beautiful white naval been base. The portion is big, plenty to share. Probably one of the best octopus dishes we've had in Toronto. We followed this with the mushroom pasta - firm pasta, great mushrooms (hen beak?) and beautiful cheese: Well executed. The pizza was thin, hot and tasty in the extreme. The halibut on the bone was also worthwhile. We found  our rapine to be a bit tough, although it looked good!

The wine list is sufficiently extensive, we had an interesting Corsican white followed by a very good Burgundy ($120).

We watched the large and expensive porterhouse steaks going out of the kitchen, they looked superb.
Overall this place is not cheap, but the quality makes it very worthwhile."}
{"text":"Decor is modern and attractive. Our server was very attentive.  Where we found Giulietta fell short was the food. This is not elevated cooking but basic Italian. Both the pizza and pasta dishes were bland and lacked flavour.  Pizzeria Libretto has better pizza and Terroni, more flavourful pasta. When we gave it the \"would you go back\" test, each person in our party proclaimed No."}
{"text":"While the evening started off rocky at the start for us, I'd definitely be coming back and try other items on the menu!

We came in for an 8pm reservation at the bar and the place was already busy. Got checked in, but felt a little left out as several parties who came in after immediately got seated. The hostess perhaps saw how annoyed we were getting that she offered a complimentary glass of bubblies. A small gesture goes a long way and this definitely helped us from getting \"hangry\". (I must say, they've definitely recovered with flair!)

We finally got seated 20 minutes later and it was all smooth sailing from here. The bar host was friendly and knowledgeable. We had the crudo, cacio e pepe, wild mushrooms side, and the highlight of them all - the bistecca. Boy, that must have been at least a 32 oz. t-bone steak slightly charred on the outside and cooked medium rare on the inside and well-seasoned. The lightness of the mushrooms was a perfect compliment to the well-marbled fat on the steak. Having had the bistecca at Mario's in Florence has had me on the lookout for reasonably priced steaks (or cote de beoufs) in the city. I must say this has definitely made my list of go-tos when craving red meat. I'm so glad this is going to fill the gap that Bestellen left when it closed.

Despite being super full, we couldn't resist trying out Nona's tart. It was a really buttery treat that capped off the evening meal.

I'm sure there a minor kinks that still needed to be ironed out since this place has just been open for a few weeks, but I'm already plotting my next visit. There are so many items on the menu that I'd like to try (but it'll be super tough to not have to get the bistecca)."}
{"text":"It was a really nice restaurant. The deco of the restaurant is morden and pretty. The service was amazing. The people there were nice, our server explained the whole menus and gave us recommendations since we had a hard time understanding the menus, even though it has English written saying what is in the dish.. The quality of the food was good too. We ordered the olives rapped in meatballs and beef tatars for starters, a chicken dish and pizza for entree. My friend love the taste on all the dishes we ordered.

However, the only thing I might complain was the wait time it took between dishes. We had 4 dishes and it took us 2 hours to finish (from 630pm till 830). If the dishes could come a bit faster that would be better."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night, the food and wine is off the chain (as the kids say). The lardo with the house bread I could eat every day (and slowly die). The sausage wrapped olives, equally so. The wine list was varied, easy to navigate, and the sommelier was a great help picking the wine. I'd go here again and again. Also the cutlery? Super cute. 

Try the Amaro and espresso. And the negronis. Ok everything."}
{"text":"A beautiful restaurant with incredibly welcoming and knowledgeable staff. My partner and I enjoyed the gnocchi and the goat following olive stuffed sausage to start, everything was absolutely delicious. I don't believe I've ever had gnocchi so perfectly cooked! The wine list is long and well curated for every taste and price point, the sommelier was happy to spend time with us in order to find a great bottle (or several) for our meal. The cocktails hit it out of the park as well!
There were no kinks to iron out in this new restaurant, I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Talk about getting the formula right. This place is wonderful, offering high value to customers, in a customer focused concept. 

Food, quality, service, atmosphere - all set to exceed expectations. 

The old Bestellen, this place has really been transformed. The interior's designed by the guys who did Buca, so you're left with clean and industrial, with touches of wood to give you a real retro, romantic and city feel to the space.

Service wise, these guys just get it. Staff are dressed crisp, and behave in a warm yet extremely professional manner. There's pride in this location, and you can see it in the way servers talk about food and the recommendations they make. The place does tend to get packed up and service does slow down slightly as a result, but it's not in an unacceptable manner.

The added touches of free sparkling or flat water really show that the restaurant is customer focused, and not focused on the ego of the chef. They're full and drawing in customers because they clearly get the sustainability of that model. Menu wise, Chef Rob Rossi is knocking it out of the park with a traditional yet sophisticated Italian menu. 

Stand out dishes include the octopus, the seafood pasta, the goat and almost all the contorni. What's really impressive is the price to quality ratio. For example, I'm not sure where else in the city I can get a whole small octopus for $20, or an entire plateful of mushrooms for $12. 

The place has really lifted up my food spirits for the Toronto food scene, after seeing repeated fluff restaurants open up city wide. 

Bravo guys, you really are doing it right here."}
{"text":"Rob Rossi's new space in the former Bestellen on College has been transformed into one of the sexiest restaurants in the city. Gone is the (admittedly charming) meaty decor, and in its place, is a new, sleek, sophisticated space, with gorgeous seating, lighting and tables. 

But the food ... oh, the food!  We had a beautiful pizza and some perfect frito misto to start ... but the main - braised goat and polenta - was to die for.  Add a great wine list and smooth, well-informed service makes the experience a delight.  

The pine nut \" butter tart \" and baba au rhum that capped off the meal were faultless. Check out the amaro cart as well before you settle your bill .... the Calabrian blood orange stuff is amazing. 

Well done!"}
{"text":"The ambiance of this place is top-notch. Definitely date night potential. The service was attentive and when we asked for recommendations our server was very helpful and informative. The pizza crust is one of the best I've had in the city - thin and chewy. The grilled octopus is a must order. $20 dollars for two, definitely shareable among 4 people. The brocollini was just okay, nothing special about grilled vegetables. The gnocchi was good, but doesn't beat Ufficio's."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best Italian restaurants in the city! I have nothing but amazing things to say about the food and service. The staff went above and beyond to make our experience memorable. From the starters to dessert there wasn't a single dish that I didn't enjoy. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This new restaurant is exceptional. It is the sister restaurant to L'Unita in Yorkville and is every bit as wonderful. The attention to detail in the whole experience is second to none. The food is classic Italian dishes that have been tested and refined and perfected. There were incredible flavours and perfect moments. We could not be happier to welcome this new venture to our city!"}
