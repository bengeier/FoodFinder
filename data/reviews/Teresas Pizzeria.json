{"text":"Not a fan. Sauce is gross. Topping were under the cheese. Idk if this is an Ohio thing at this point, moved here a few months ago.  But people everything falls off the pizza when u do this. Stop!!"}
{"text":"We were nervous about trying this location based on the reviews but we bought a coupon sheet from the local Vets and this year it was for this location. Have to say we have been extremely surprised by how good the pizzas, salads and canolis have been. The pizza has a nice sweet sauce and the bacon is real thick pieces so it doesn't get lost in the mix of things. On our first visit we met the owner he said he has met a handful of people who bought the same coupons and did not know about this location. I have to say I'm impressed and we will continue to order pizza again from them!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Streetsboro.   The pizzas can be on the the greasy side and their prices are a little bit higher, but they slay the chain pizzerias in terms of quality.     The ingredients are hearty and generous.   I would try the rest of the menu but I never get past the pizzas, I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great sauce. Lots of cheese but they put it on top. Wings are decent. Kinda pricey. The menu with pricing pictured on Yelp is old and not current FYI"}
{"text":"I had moved to the edge of hudson back from cleveland recently and didn't know any delivery places and happened upon teresas. Originally it was ok, they had these chicks working there who did a great job and gave great portions and delivery was always on time. But as time went on there'd be alot of days id call and theyd say they weren't delivering. Theyd start skimping on salad toppings (meat/cheese etc), so id pay for double toppings and again only get the skimpy toppings so i felt cheated. Then the salad dressing is super watery and comes in tiny cups which they only give you two for free and charge extra. Every other place gives me way more dressing in larger portions for free. Most of the time i had to buy a bottle of their Teresas dressing with my salads. Their red sauce has like nothing but black pepper in it it's overwhelmingly peppered up (which places do when they have cheap/crappy sauce). They only messed up my order a few times. They pissed me off 2weeks ago cause i found a metal paperclip (im guessing from the order ticket?) at the bottom of my salad. I mean i guess its not a huge deal but cmon guys. The food isn't good enough quality wise or price wise and the service isn't good enough and they're not reliable enough. Theres some price gouging issues with toppings on their pizzas and calzones as well, you can just get em cheaper by ordering something with alot of toppings and subbing them out, they should add like a pick 5 toppings pizza/calzone to their menu. And their beverage selections suck as well, do you want coke, sprite or coke ? I stopped ordering from them as soon as i found/remembered Gioninos which has better food and pricing and delivers later and is reliable and their red sauce isn't overpowerlingly peppered like teresas."}
{"text":"Nasty! I watched the cook go from making a pizza to answering the phone, take more orders then proceeded to finish making the pizza ALL WITHOUT WASHING HANDS OR WEARING GLOVES!  Grosssssss"}
{"text":"It was ok. I wasnt crazy about the sauce.. but there was a lot of cheese.. took about 15 minutes to cook the pizza."}
{"text":"I really don't have much to say about Teresas Pizza...but stay away. The cook is the one answering the phone along with the driver. When ordering via phone the worker seemed not to know what they were doing and finally when the pizza arrived, it looked as though it has been run over by a truck. No effort, and their was clumps of cheese all over it. I've had pizza in the past from this location, never holds up to standards. I expect more. Only positive, it came quickly."}
{"text":"This pizza was disgusting! Worst pizza I have EVER eaten! The dough was WAY undercooked and was so soggy. Both my mom and I felt sick after eating it. If you're wanting a good pizza, this place AIN'T IT!"}
{"text":"This has become our preferred pizza place in Streetsboro, for what has become  Friday Night Pizza Night. The cheese is good-- I think that's what makes their pizza stand out.  They put the cheese-- provolone?-- on top of the toppings, instead of under.  It makes it a little harder to eat but it's worth it. The staff is nice too!"}
{"text":"Great food and the staff are super friendly one kf my favorite pizza spots in Streetsboro."}
