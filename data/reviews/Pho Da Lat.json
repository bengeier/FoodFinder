{"text":"This is some of the freshest, best tasting food - and you will crave it.   The staff - ask for Abner- is friendly and attentive. My favorite is the \"soup on the side\" but too frequently I have company and it's not a great sharing dish. The curry is great - and go spicy - it's a tollerable heat.  One more advantage - good wine list, all bottles just $20. Enjoy one of my favorite spots."}
{"text":"I'm serious about soup; so much so that I eat it in 100F.  There's something so comforting and relaxing about it. 

Went on a Friday at 6:30pm and it was pretty empty, so we got sat right away by a very friendly server. 

Ever since I tried Pho Ga at Noodles Ranch in Old Town, I've been trying to find a place just as amazing mostly due to location. I've tried two others in Mesa off Dobson rd. NOTHING has topped it yet. Here's why...

Pho Dalat's beef based broth was very tasty; I'll give them that, but there wasn't much chicken. Other then the usual add-ins provided with Pho, the soup consisted only of shredded chicken breast pieces and noodles. At NOODLES RANCH the Pho Ga comes with bright greens of broccoli and baby bok choy. 

I'll continue my quest for a nearby pho place !"}
{"text":"What can I say... this place was PHO me ;) Fast friendly service, average pho prices ( I paid $7 plus $2 for my drink) and the atmosphere was very laid back but the staff were professional. The music wasn't overwhelming, which is something I always dread when trying a new place. I ordered the #8 Pho which included meatball, beef, tendons, sinews, and other parts I was unsure of but was completely delighted by their chewy and jello like textures in my mouth. I'm a texture person. The flavor was awesome as well. The noodles were perfect. Long, thin, and chewy. I had looked them up before going and saw they only took cash unless you spend over $15. If I had not known that before going I wouldn't have stayed for lunch and would've been angry at not having my pho fix.  I will deft be coming here again."}
{"text":"This is a hidden little gem in the area.  The food is very flavorful, the ambience is very comfortable and private, and the service is impeccable.  I have only tried the Bun dishes, but they have been excellent, and the dishes that my dining companions have selected have looked very delicious too.  The iced coffee, is of course, awesome as well. Definitely a place I'll be visiting often!"}
{"text":"Minus one star for having those hungry big fish in that tiny fish pond at the entrance. Thats cruel guys. They look miserable. And having a big amazing meal and looking at that makes my heart melt.

Coming to the food: Amazing food ! if for some reason you have a choice, pick this one and go ! Amazing Pho! Its all in the broth? the, very well done ! Pick thai coffee for dessert if you like milky sweet coffee."}
{"text":"I am impressed with the food and service here.  

I was initially looking to enjoy some delicious Korean food, but the place that I wanted to visit were closed on a Sunday.  I then opted for Vietnamese food.  I am rather new to Arizona, but have visited Saigan Pho in Tempe area twice thus far with my room mate, but wanted to try a different place.  

I walked in and was seated right away.  I am not going to lie, when I first arrived the parking lot was almost fully empty, with just one SUV parked in front, which made me a little skeptical.  I walked in to find just one couple eating their food.  The aroma coming from the kitchen welcomed me and as soon as I opened the menu, I knew that they were serious about their Vietnamese food.

I ordered the fresh shrimp and chicken spring rolls, which come with a delicious peanut sauce. 

My main order was of the seafood Pho which consisted of big delectable shrimp, squid, fried fish cakes, and crab meat (imitation, but still yummy) in a rich and flavorful pork broth.  I wanted to try something different, so I chose the yummy pork broth, as opposed to the normal beef broth.  I also had them combine two different types of noodles for me, ramen and clear ones.  The combination of the various flavors and noodles, really enhanced the meal.  I also enjoyed a cold Sapporo beer, which for happy hour was only $2.00.

I love their happy hour prices for appetizers and beers.  I will be back for more happy hour deliciousness at Pho Da Lat. 

BTW, I went to wash my hands before I ate and the bathrooms were beautiful and clean and the waitress was very attentive and sweet.

I think I may have my next East Coast foodies event here.  THe prices are amazing, the food is delicious and plentiful, and the ambiance is welcoming."}
{"text":"I'm the pho specialist. I am so picky when it comes to eating pho at restaurants. In terms of good pho in Chandler, I cannot complain much about this place. I always get a rare beef pho, and it's not bad.. The price is reasonable, service is prompt, and the soup is great. Location is good. Best after hangover. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat at but today I experienced the worst customer service possible. I was at the door to pick up my lunch. When I first walked in no one was behind me but after a crowd began to form. One of the waitresses looked past me and started seating everyone else behind me, 3 separate parties. After she seated each party. She then walked right past me and still refused to acknowledge me. She didn't even check to see if anyone else had assisted me. After a few more minutes a different waitress ended up getting my order. I will not be back there."}
{"text":"Really like this place.  Good, clean, and good customer service at fair prices."}
{"text":"Sadly it is going downhill. More like a 2.5 star place. Soup is lacking flavor, vegetables aren't fresh, place aren't as clean as it used to be. We are exploring other pho places now..."}
{"text":"Pho is delicious!  Haven't found any really great pho in scottsdale so this was such a great find as we've been missing some authentic Pho.  Hubby had the vermicelli bowl which he thought was delicious as well.  Really happy we found this place."}
{"text":"Man pho was bad yesterday. I hate to rip on my people but they need to step it up. Noodle tasted like one of those instant pho from Lee Lee's supermarket and was extra soggy. I could have sworn the \"special combination\" was a lot better last time. The fatty piece they added into the special combination tasted weird. Won't be coming back anytime soon until I see better reviews."}
{"text":"I liked this place! The food was good! I would rate it with 5 stars because this is probably the best in Tempe Area, however I had been in better places. Overall, I really really like this place."}
{"text":"The meat in the chicken and beef pho was overcooked and dry. Service was slow, had to flag down our waitress, who was busy on her cell phone, to get her to help us."}
{"text":"This is nice place for pho. The staff is very friendly, and the restaurant is pleasant and clean. Also, the wine prices are awesome - $6 per glass of some pretty good labels."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times and food has always been very good, while service was adequate. However, on my most recent visit, my mannish \"waitress\" was brusque, unhelpful, and downright rude. I will not return, despite living only a block away."}
{"text":"Was excited to find a pho place near Costco on I-10, since I shop there semi-weekly. I live in Laveen, which is not close to any pho--and I LOVE pho. I typically go to Glendale or north Phoenix for pho. I have tried almost every pho place in Phoenix, and this one would have been an excellent addition to my rotation because of where they are located. Despite the two stars rating I would go back to Pho Du Lat again if I am ever shopping at Costco or Total Wine, and having a craving for VIetnamese---however---let me be clear that it is only because of the location. But I'd be complaining about how much they charge for what I get AND the lack of some very important essentials. So, if you want an EXCELLENT pho place to try--THIS ONE IS NOT IT. Let me explain.

The restaurant is a good size and clean. Bathrooms are clean. Service is fine. Not spectacular, but basically good. You can get in and out for lunch in a reasonable time. The staff is lackluster, though. Let's just say unenthusiastic, okay?

I ordered a dry noodle dish (I chose egg noodles) that came with fish ball, pork, chicken, beef ball and shrimp. I ordered it because it comes with the pork broth on the side, and the entree has a *spicy* star next to it, and I like spicy dishes.

The server asked me on a scale of 1-5 for hotness. I chose a 4. So...let me tell you what I got....
I got an unusually small serving of food. A small portion of egg noodles that were cooked fine (but sticky, which is common, so I had to use my broth to separate them--not a big deal), but the meat was so freaking skimpy. There was a fish ball a little bit smaller than the diameter of a quarter. The beef ball was somewhat bigger, and cut in half. There were two medium/small shrimp (the menu says \"jumbo\"--but they aren't remotely jumbo) and there was a few strands of bland, boiled/rubbery flavorless chicken and two tiny, thin pieces of pork. The meat sat hidden under the small portion of noodles and on top was a smattering of ripped up romaine lettuce. The broth, as advertised, came on the side. The broth was good, and contained the grilled shallots. This dish cost $8, but you or I would have spent about 99 cents making it, if that. The heat level was around 1 or 2 at most. I had to request chili/garlic paste----and she returned with a meager tablespoon in a small dish.

There were NO herbs...No cilantro. No limes or lemons. No fresh, cut jalapenos. No fresh, chubby bean sprouts. NONE of the tables had any garlic/chili paste, spoons, chopsticks, etc.

My solo lunch included iced tea and an order of vegetarian spring rolls. The spring rolls were pakced tightly with romaine and lacked any herbal flavor. The sauce was primarily fish hoisin sauce with crushed peanut in it. I much prefer a thick peanut based sauce with chili flakes. This stuff was okay, but not what I prefer...

The total cost (NOT including tip) was $15.09. WAY TOO EXPENSIVE FOR LUNCH. That being said, if the food was outstanding and worth driving to, I'd have happily paid $15 for it. It was NOT THAT GREAT. It was...MEH."}
{"text":"i love it. I am Vietnamese and i live long time in US. I love this place. It is sweet and nice. The taste is authentic and the best i ever tried in Tempe and Phoenix. It is better than some places near Asian market. Pho is the best and spring roll is awesome. 

I wish this place closed to my house then i can eat it some time a week. It is not cheap like the ones near ASU, but you get what you pay, it is 1-2 dollars more for bowl of Pho, but taste way better. It a little noisy on Sat after 9pm, as they have karaoke, other than, it is great. The size of lunch is smaller than dinner size and price is different too. I like the lunch size better, as i can eat the other appetizer."}
{"text":"I was not impressed. I ordered the vegetarian pho, and the broth was so-so, the tofu wasn't fried and was in giant hunks, it seemed like most of the vegetables were canned (baby corn, water chestnuts, and mushrooms), there were maybe three piece of broccoli, which I wish there was more of, and the bok choy was way over-cooked. Definitely not a place I will go again.

On the plus our waitress was very nice, and the wine is very inexpensive, although that didn't make up for my unappealing pho."}
{"text":"Moved here from Orange County recently, and although it isn't as good as my usual SoCal spots, it's definitely good for Arizona."}
{"text":"Good pho and atmosphere but service was too slow. I waited for almost 45minutes for my pho..."}
{"text":"To start, our server was quick and on the ball! The salad rolls (garden rolls) were fresh, but too minty for my taste, but my boyfriend said he really like the heavy spearmint flavor that they had. Peanut sauce can be hit or miss, but their sauce was pretty good. Seemed like it had a smoked hint to it. 
As for the Phò we had, so tasty. Not over oily broth, a lot of meat, and just the right amount of onions. I also like the portions of bean sprouts and peppers they bring for the phò. It wasn't a huge heaping pile that you feel like you are wasting by not using. 
Looks like they have karaoke on the weekends or something. That along with their wine collection could make quite the pho-king experience."}
{"text":"Delicious food at reasonable price! #14 of the Pho Soup is bomb."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. I really like the #39. I went with some coworkers once who were all jealous of my #39. Today, we ordered out and got an order of spring rolls, a #9 rare pho and #39 grilled chicken and rice. The spring rolls were a pretty big disappointment. They were soggy (but they were to go), kinda chewy (too chewy) and they came with fish sauce I'm not a huge fan of. My grilled chicken and rice also came with fish sauce. I would prefer something else and I know you can ask for peanut sauce instead. The pho was good (as I was told) but nowhere near as good as khai hoan. They recently did some remodeling. Overall, it's pretty good and I would recommend it to someone looking for a spot in this area to get Vietnamese."}
{"text":"I eat here a couple of times per week. Always tell myself not to come back. However, it's the closest pho to me. This time was the last for sure. 

Food is ok. Summer and garden rolls are ok but small. Pho is ok. Skimpy on meat.  Spring roll with lettuce wrap is great. 

Service is indifferent and forgetful. Sometimes food takes a while. 

Biggest annoyance is the $0.45 charge if you're paying with credit card under $15. Build the cost into your food and don't piss off diners with a trivial charge. 

I'm going to drive further to get my pho fix from now on. 

Again. Nothing bad. But just ok is not good enough."}
{"text":"Nice decor, so-so food.  Probably the most bland pho I've had in the Valley.  Nothing particularly negative about it - except of course bland pho is fairly negative.  The menu selection is also fairly limited compared to every other Vietnamese place I visit (Da Vang comes to mind, but who can compare with them?).  I'm going to go try a  few other selections and am keeping my fingers crossed they warrant an upgrade to 3 stars.  But can't do it based on the pho alone."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and was not my first visit.  Was not greeted by the server just ask how many in party.  I asked for a booth, server attitude very poor.  After being seated no greeting just stood there with pen and pad.....really?  I ordered spring rolls and bun bo hue soup.  Food was good but the empty appetizer plate and eaten soup bowl sat on my table.  No follow up for how meal was.  Even had to ask another employee for water.  Such disgust.  As a Vietnamese I consider this place catering to white type folks. I only said this because there was a white family that was sat behind me.  Omg server was as pleasant as can be.  Oh please.   Prices are high and portions are small.   My money is spent better elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is pretty okay! It's not a place I'll make a special trip to, but if I'm in the neighborhood and I'm craving some pho, I might stop. 

Service could definitely be improved.  It wasn't very full and we had to wait quite a bit. Bit slow, courteous but not friendly, if that makes sense. Moreover, the waiter forgot my husband's tea with our order. We ended up just leaving it that way, we just made sure it wasn't charged at the end. 

The food had good flavor, but it wasn't particularly fresh. We both had chicken pho. There wasn't anything particularly special about the food here. 

One thing I didn't like at all was that they had large fish in a tiny little pond by the entrance, which is awful, poor things. 

Also, by our table, there was this (adult) guy putting his bare feet on the booth seat and touching them.  I'm not sure if there's anything the management could have done about that, but it was definitely gross, especially in an eating establishment."}
{"text":"Yummy! I enjoyed the pho and my friend enjoyed the bun. I know it was very nice inside."}
{"text":"I used to love Pho Dalat when they served fuller bowls of cold rice noodles, with oodles of grilled meat and peanut seasoning, complimented with crunchy salad greens and tangy fish sauce. Gone are those days when the waiting staff were shy but politely chatty and regular visitors were acknowledged. Now the prawn or meat in a bowl of Bun has dwindled, smart but precise waiters have been appointed and the prices have been hiked along with the number of discount -announcing advertisements in local newspapers. I sincerely wish that this restaurant finds its footing once again because it has always had quite a few things going for it, like good quality food, quick service and some great ambiance."}
{"text":"Our favorite waiter left the restaurant about a year ago and since then, the service is really crappy to the point now where I have to update my review. Before he left, He told us that the other waiters felt like we were bad tippers and he was surprised to hear that because we always gave him a big tip. We didn't take offense to him telling us this because he knew that we use to wait tables before and our tip is solely based on the service we receive. He even backed us up and said that if they want a better tip from us- they have to learn how to give good service.

My update isn't about the food much because I still think the food is good and we visit this restaurant time to time just for it. Kudos to the chef! The bun bo hue is delicious!!

What I would like to express to the staff and management at this restaurant is that, if you expect your customers to tip well, you must first provide good service.


For example, if you drop off the food and never check back on your customers until they flag you down for the check and water, do you believe that you've earned your tip simply by taking an order and delivering the food? I know some waiters believe that there is justification for giving bad service if the  customer is a bad tipper--but let me tell you, if this is your understanding of customer service, you may want to find another job. 

I almost want to give the staff here a free lesson on how to be attentive to their customers and what good service is all about if they get butthurt over tipping. 
As a waitress, I had customers who actually followed me restaurant to restaurant. As a customer, I enjoy getting to know the wait staff and try to be as easiest customer. 

Now, yelp readers must be wondering how bad of a tipper my husband and I are if the wait staff labeled us cheap. For shitty service we still give 10% because we've waited tables before, however, our tipping is usually above 20%."}
{"text":"Love, love this place! Best Chicken Pho! Also try the fried rice and the crystal chicken. Prices are reasonable and it's clean!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for a few years. The staff has always been consistent, friendly and professional. 

The lunch pho prices are insane. In a world of over processed food, this place keeps it simple and tasty. 

Cant wait to get back!"}
{"text":"I used to love eating here til yesterday. I will NEVER come back. Our server doesn't speak English well, poor service by her, brought us food without plate n silverware, never check on our water refill. Hire English speaking worker goodness."}
{"text":"My experience was terrible especially because of the manager and the mindless waiter. I ordered a stir-fry noodle and he came back with soup noodle. I told him this was wrong and he returned the food and asked me to specify on what i wanted again and I did, and he came back with the wrong sh*t again. This time it was even nastier because it looked like they didn't want to waste the previous soup and somehow extracted the liquid to make the \"sauce\" and just added different noodles! The color of the \"stir-fry\" looked exactly like the color of the soup that i returned!! I tried it and then it tasted so SWEET LIKE THEY USED FISH SAUCE (NUOC MAM)!! WHICH IS WRONG!!! I was even more frustrated when the manager came out as if i was in the wrong! she was like \"ok, what do you want!\" showing me the menu. I had it and didn't order anything else because the service was terrible and the food was even WORSE!!! I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND. (THERE IS MORE I WOULD ADD BUT ILL END IT BY SAYING IT IS THE WORSE VIETNAMESE RESTAURANT AND FOOD EVER)"}
{"text":"Love this place you can get veggie pho with veggie broth and they do have other vegan options as well as Omni options. The service is super fast and the staff is so nice. I never have to ask for a water refill they just automatically bring water sometimes without me even noticing."}
{"text":"Excellent food and the staff was extremely friendly. Pleasant experience all around."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and got the Pho which is always good.  This is convenient to get in and out of quickly and they give good service.  The food quality always seems consistent."}
{"text":"Second Time I Been In the Last 2 Weeks Good Food, Will Like To Try A Few More Things On The Menu.. Will Go Back"}
{"text":"I live here, and all the servers are great.  I'm here 1-3 times a week, the Spring rolls are to dir for and the Pho is fantastic loaded with noodles and Veggies, great way to get a hot an healthy meal.  The place is always packed for lunch, so come early or for a late lunch.  My favorite is the #35 Spicy Beef Vermicelli, I only can handle the 3 out of 5 on the heat scale."}
{"text":"We like the Pho Special...I don't really know how authentic the place is but we like to dine-in and carry out from here about once a month."}
{"text":"This place is OK. One of the waitress isn't nice at all. The price is good!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for the pho and spring rolls. It was good enough to bring me back the first few times, but the last time I went (this past winter) the pho was a huge letdown. Not sure if it was an off day or they were running out of broth because it was late, but it was very bland. I probably won't take another chance on this place since I know of at least a few other places that consistently serve good pho."}
{"text":"Fantastic vietnamese food. The staff is very friendly and attentive.
The pho dalat, bun bo hue, and mi la kai are must haves.  The pork and shrimp rolls and the roast quail are perhaps the best I've had anywhere."}
{"text":"I have only had the Pho here, but it was really good. Flavorful broth, not too salty, with high-quality and fresh ingredients. I like to get the rare beef and tendon, and the beef is very tender, and they give a good serving of tendon. Someday I'll try some other things from the menu, but the Pho noodle soup is so good I just keep getting the same thing."}
{"text":"One of the better Vietnamese places I've been to in AZ.  

The place is oddly named, though -- they're really not a pho shop, at least not in the sense of what I usually see at similarly named restaurants here in OC.  Their pho really isn't even all that good, but the rest of their dishes are usually quite tasty.  The look and feel of the restaurant is also decidedly more upscale than your average pho restaurant.  

They've got a good variety of dishes, and everything that we've tried  (other than the pho) has been very good.  In an area where there's relatively few good Vietnamese restaurants, it's definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Solid Pho, Basil Rolls are pretty good.  You do have to ask them to bring out the basics (chopsticks, fish sauce, garlic pepper paste, etc).  But overall, yeah, it's a decent joint for those cold Pho days.  Clean facility, friendly staff."}
{"text":"Super fast service! We ordered shrimp vermicelli and chicken pho soup. Both had excellent flavor. Shrimp was cooked and seasoned perfectly."}
{"text":"Good food and great service! Prices are agreeable and the portions are generous and honestly some of the best asian food I've had so far!"}
{"text":"Used to love this place but new staff isn't friendly and forgot my shrimp. I went in alone so hate know what they'd forget if it was multiple people. Pho was good"}
{"text":"My First Vietnamese restuarant , we ordered veggie rolls first and then i ordered fried rice with chicken. Taste was good and different.  Though rice was lot dry. One thing i liked was they came frequently to ask  if everything is fine and if we need anything else. I will definitely go again to check some other dish."}
{"text":"Awesome Vietnamese food!  I tried the delicious signature pho and roasted duck, egg noodles soup. Affordable for all the family dine in."}
{"text":"Totally impressed by this place. Food was incredible... As good as Cyclo without the wait. We had the shrimp bun and the rare steak pho, both were great! Server was excellent and we never had to wait for anything. Would definitely recommend this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Bits of PLASTIC IN MY FOOD!! DISGUSTING!!! NO NO NO NO!! This restaurant MUST BE SHUT DOWN!
Towards the end of my meal I realized there were small bits of plastic in my hot soup (aka. pho). As a polymer scientist and engineer, I could tell it was either polyetheylene or polystyrene of some sort... either way these polymers may dissolve in hot water, are carcinogenic (cause cancer and other disease) and are very oxidating against DNA. Batches of Pho soup are made all at once in large quantities.. these bits of plastic were dissolved in EVERYONE'S SOUP! 
Then people ask themselves how they get sick??????? Because of unhealthy restaurants that are somehow legally operating and selling people poison. They should have at least added \"polystyrene\" in the list of ingredients on the menu, so people at least know they're being served plastic!"}
{"text":"Most likely we will not come back to this place.  Pho broth tasted like plain water with some salt added to it.  
The vegetarian vermicelli dish was a rip off.  Only had a few pieces of tofu.  

The fabric napkins smells old.  Food was delivered to us with no utensils.  

The eggrolls were ok like how they're supposed to be. 

Was very disappointed.  I saw the ad on the magazine and wanted to try this place but probably will not come back."}
{"text":"I've had Vietnamese at a handful of places in the valley and most places felt a little sketchy, the meat a little rubbery. However, this strip mall place is a step up from the average local Pho joint. The Crazy Noodle and Pho are both winners. The Vietnamese iced coffee is fantastic. Service is always great, prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Alright! This is my very first review and it's negative for the simple fact that I just had the worst experience at a Pho restaurant. 

I called in a to-go order at this place, that included Pho and spring rolls, and the host on the line stated my food would be ready in 10-15 min, thinking that is pretty long in my head but I did order crispy spring rolls with lettuce and mint leaves, so i say \"sounds good.\" I get there 15 min after I placed my order and tell the host I was there to pick up and he gave me a deer in headlights look and said \"we are running behind do you still want your order?\" Not thinking he might have not placed my order when I called in (which is exactly what happened) I said \"yes.\" It's raining out and I love Pho when it's raining! I actually waited another 20 min before my food came out while 2 other patrons came in and received their pick up orders. I said something to the host about it taking soo long 10 min in to the wait and again the deer in headlights glare came back and he said \"sorry we're just so busy.\"
I would be OK with this if he would have told me on the phone that it would take 35 min to make Pho even though it's just broth and noodles!! I will never go back to this place, I will stick to my Saigon Pho on Alma School in between Warner and Ray in Chandler to fulfill my Pho needs!

PHO YOU PHOCKERS AT PHO DA LAT!!!!"}
{"text":"Pho Tai - Easy rare Pho(Eye-round steak beef) Meat wasn't too rare, got cooked in the hot soup. Excellent food choices, quick and very attentive service."}
{"text":"They were just fine. Not that great and not that bad. The interior design was more likely a cafe which is actually very good. Only thing that bothers me is the price. The price on their menu is different from what you actually paying. My special pho appeared $10.95 on the menu but end it up with $11.95. Same thing happened to my roommate's rice plate. This is absolutely not cool, because on their Togo menu, the price get fixed. But anyway, I don't think I will go again or recommend to any one around me."}
{"text":"I love this place. It is right by both my office and home and I frequent it often. I get the Grilled Shrimp Bun. SO GOOD! It is quick, fresh and great price."}
{"text":"The chicken Pho here is amazing!! Great service and perfect for a lunch hour during work. I come here about every 2 weeks. Never a disappointment!"}
{"text":"GREAT SERVICE!!!!!!!!!!! 
Every waiter or waitress I have had have been super helpful.
They always make sure that everyone likes their dish and if they don't, they offer to bring you a different dish... but I have never tried something I didn't like. I love their beef rolls and soups, their happy hour specials are a super great deal, and they have boba and thai tea. 
I haven't been to Vietnam and have no Vietnamese friends so I don't know how authentic the food is... but what I do know is that it always taste good. Also, their portions are the right size, big enough to get full but not to big that I feel like I'm going to explode if I finish my dish.
Finally, the interior decoration is very clean and contemporary. Also, they have a water feature by the entrance that creates a peaceful environment as you come in. 
I love this restaurant... is great!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"While in Tempe with the family and the mother in law, we stopped in for some Pho for lunch
We all had the Pho, My mother-in law who is Vietnamese, said the pho reminded her of Pho back home. Nuff said pho for lunch was great.  Service was great, though it was lunch time and we were 4 of the 8 in their at that time.  Really enjoyed the fried spring roll and the pineapple ice tea too."}
{"text":"I popped in spontaneously for a quick takeout lunch, but I was so happy with the Bun with spring rolls, I wanted to write a review.  It was fresh, delicious, minty, crisp, and refreshing -- and HUGE (I'll probably eat the rest for dinner, and maybe have leftovers even then).  And cheap!  $6.55 including tax for something I would have cheerfully paid $10 for.

The service was quick, kind, gracious.  I didn't realize that they prefer you pay cash under $15, but it was no problem that I only had a card.  The decor is nifty and modern.

I'll definitely be coming back for dinner and hopefully several more lunches in the future!  Hooray tasty Vietnamese in my very own neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Well... what can I say?

The prices is expensive compared to other locations and I'm not sure what happened, but when my pho came out it tasted like it was burnt.

I'm giving this 3 stars because only good thing g was the mussels."}
{"text":"Awesome food, awesome service! The Easy Rare Pho was very good. 
Our server was super friendly and brought our food quickly. 
Try the Thai Iced Coffee... It's so decadent!"}
{"text":"Here right now, sat down for 15 min without service. Workers too busy talking in the back. Seem to happen all the time. Mangers need to step up. The food is good but waitress and waiters suck."}
{"text":"The only place in town that offers Cá Nng Da Giòn (crispy grilled fish). The seasonsing is not as good as the one I had in Little Saigon, but it is still decent for a fun family dinner.
I also their Pho very good. The broth has a deep flavoring from beef bone. I cleaned my bowl without a drop left."}
{"text":"I work nearby here, decided to stroll in for a solo lunch. I've had my share of pho, but I have a phobia of orderng things that are difficult to eat. I apologize that was corny. Get used to it.

Anyway, the atmosphere and food are why I keep coming back. Nice and relaxing, sounds of running water abound, and attentive service. 

Only tried a few things here, but the pork vermicelli duo is outstanding. Fresh, feel good food that leaves you feeling rejuvenated, not bloated. Great for when you need to actually get some work done in the afternoon. Also try the iced tea with whipped cream, SUPER delish. Addictive! 

I will need to try their happy hour which seems solid also."}
{"text":"This place has a lot of bad reviews so I thought I'd come on here and say something nice. Pho was delicious, service was quick, and I will return. The only negative was the .45 charge to use my debit card (especially when my bank, Chase, is in the same parking lot). I've had plenty of pho before but this kind really struck my fancy. I hope people continue to go here because it's right next door to where I live and I would like to see them stay in business."}
{"text":"Went with a group of 7 of us, spur of the moment craving for Pho. Turned out to be a disappointing visit. The service was less than tolerable. The waitress was slow, doesn't know her menu, and a bit argumentative, had to ask for drink refills all night. When our food came out, which actually did not take long, we were disappointed at the skimpy vegetable servings for our Pho, the lack of sauce/gravy for the crispy egg noodle dish, and a complete misunderstanding of one of the orders. Not enough veggies, no problem, we just asked for an extra vegetable plate for the Pho to split between three of us, but it took them 3 trips back to our table to remember to bring it to us after 2 reminders. Then when we asked for more sauce for the dry crispy noodles, the kitchen came back and said they are unable to make more without making a whole other batch and essentially charging us another plate... As for the misunderstood order... My friend just asked for their chicken rice plate except he wanted to substitute the chicken with shrimp since shrimp rice plate was not an option on the menu, waitress said yes they can do that but will have to charge him extra which he was fine with. What my friend ended up with was a simple sauteed shrimp served over plain white rice in their smallest white rice bowl, nothing like what is shown in the pictures of their rice \"plate.\" After several run arounds and back and forth with the kitchen about the rice plate we thought they finally understood so they took his dish back to the kitchen and what came back was merely the same thing now served back to him on a white plate... To top off the ridiculous evening we were told we had to be charged a fee for using our credit cards! To be fair, the Special Pho was good but nothing spectacular, definitely not worth enduring the poor customer service when there are other Pho restaurants serving better food and with service that exceeds Pho Dalat's by 100%"}
{"text":"I came here a few times with friends and was excited to take my husband to eat here for lunch until he got FOOD POISONING! TMI we could not even make it back home before pulling over. I will be reporting this case of food poising to the Maricopa County Environmental Services Department"}
{"text":"Great food and great location for a 15 person lunch."}
{"text":"I love coming for the Pho!  This place is right around the corner from my office and when I need an escape from the phone I figure this is the place to go.  I usually go between the shrimp fried rice and the chicken Pho.  Always start with the crispy spring rolls, they are awesome.  I've been here a bunch of times and should probably try something else, but this is the thing I love the most.  Keep serving it and a word to the wise, try a little Sriracha in the bowl with the lime.  Its awesome."}
{"text":"Amazing pho and fast service. They could update the music a bit though. The Bee Gee' s"}
{"text":"We love coming here for authentic Vietnamese foods. The menu is great, the service is fantastic, and the staff is friendly. The pho is excellent!"}
{"text":"This is my first time here. I don't know about other dishes but the rice plate I had was pretty good. The fish sauce mix was perfect, the grilled pork chop was cooked to perfection, the over easy egg was done well. I tried the pho and it was a typical tasting pho, nothing to rave about. I guess comparing this place to Pho Thuan Kieu at Mekong Plaza, for the prize and the amount of side dishes that they give you here, Pho Thuan Kieu gives you more for your dollar. I think I would stop by here if I was ever in the Ahwatukee area to try other dishes. 

Ambience: A
Service: A
Price: B
Food: A"}
{"text":"STAY AWAY!!! This place is TRASH. First off the pho was about room temperature. The broth tasted gross, like it had been sitting out or something, and the meatballs were made of rubber. 

I took a few bites, and decided to send back the bowl of inedible meat and noodles. I asked that the manager please remove the item from our bill since I was not satisfied with the food. The manager said he would give me another bowl, but I would have to pay for it. I didn't want anymore of there disgusting food, and the manager would not take it off the bill, so I paid, and left. 

I will never return, and I would not recommend this place to anyone. If you're reading this, please save yourself the frustration, and go somewhere else"}
{"text":"This restaurant is located close to my husband's office so we've met there for lunch a few times and actually wish that it was closer to where we live as we would certainly frequent this place.  We had the veggie spring rolls, which are very fresh and delicious.  Our favorite is also the vegetarian Pho which has broccoli, mushrooms, baby corn, and other veggies in addition to a generous portion of rice noodles and is served with the usual plate of bean sprouts, thai basil, cilantro, jalapenos, and lime.  We typically add tofu as well and all of the ingredients are very fresh and high quality.  Another nice aspect is that they offer both the traditional beef broth and a vegetable broth.  We've found the beef broth to be a bit more flavorful, but for those adhering to a vegan diet, the vegetable broth would still provide a flavorful option.

Another plus is that this restaurant also serves alcohol and offers a daily happy hour, so it would also make a nice dinner spot as the atmosphere is more tasteful than many Vietnamese restaurants.  If you're a fan of Pho, this is a place you'll want to check out."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a while now and every time I dine here I try something new. Today I tried the roasted quail, it was exquisite. Never been let down here, the pho is amazing, the ox tail sauté is even better. Even the mussels appetizer is great. Definitely a must to try this place. Make sure you get the Thai tea with boba for your drink! Only thing that could be worked on is the service, not that it was bad but they didn't stop by our table to check on us that often."}
{"text":"This place is bomb. The best pho I've had in Phx and reasonably priced. Food comes out hot and they're quick. I will def be back again. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I have tried several things here in the past few weeks and they have all been very good.  I don't eat a whole lot of Vietnamese food, but this place is real close to my neighborhood so that is always a plus.  They have made the restaurant bigger so there is plenty of seating although they due tend to be busy around lunch time.  The last few times they weren't breaking any records for speed even though my waitress was very nice.  I'm not sure this would be the best place if you are in a hurry. I appreciate the vegetarian options they have on the menu.  I thought the Vegetarian Pho was very good.  I haven't had many versions to compare it too, but it was much much better than the vegetarian versions I have had at the noodle shop downtown. The Tofu Vermicelli is really great.  it;s a cross between a hot noodle dish and a salad.  Which sounds kind of odd, but it's very good. They also have a pretty efficient take out so calling in and picking up isn't a problem.

Try:

- Vegetarian Pho.
- Tofu Vermicelli"}
{"text":"Simply the best rice and soup I have had in a long time. I had the combo rice. I usually NEVER order it because as much as I love it. It's always greasy. Not here. Also had the shrimp and port wonton soup. Just the amount of ingredients I like. I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"I am not giving this place more than 3 stars for 2 reasons ... First reason was their prices are on a expensive side and second for their services.  There's really no service whatsoever, I really don't understand that.  Once they brought my drink, water, and took my order, I don't see them again until they deliver my food.  And I don't see the server again when I'm done eating and receives my check.  The Pho tasted good, but the soup wasn't hot at all and has no flavor in it.

And once my check came, it listed how much to tip, 15%, 18%, and 20%.  And seriously, you don't provide any service at all, why should I follow your suggested tipping chart?  I will be driving to somewhere else for decent bowl of Pho, even if it's a long drive."}
{"text":"I went there a couple times first I was told that the whole place was closed for a private party. Second time I went they told me their chef/cook was gone for a month said they were serving soups only.  What restaurant has no cook really. Place isn't good"}
{"text":"I got the bún bò hu, and it was one of the best I've had. The soup was flavorful and had the right level of spice. Service was great."}
{"text":"The food and service has taken a nose dive in the last three trips there. I ordered Brisket Pho and got serloin or something and when I asked for a different dish since I was not happy with that one the waitress argued with me that it was brisket. I didnt need the arguement, I have had the brisket Pho at least ten times it was different. I think I will just go somewhere else now."}
{"text":"The price was \"ok\" and a bit high but I have to say that their food portions were large. I got pho with everything in it and as a vietnamese person who eats pho regularly, this was not all that great. There was hardly meat, just mostly ramen and soup. The flavor wasn't entirely there, at least not what I am use to. Save your money and head over to Saigon for some good pho for the right price on Alma school."}
{"text":"What an excellent find. Was dropping off a friend close by and saw this place for a quick lunch. Glad I did. Pho was excellent. No need for hoisin or any other addition. Highly flavorful and recommended."}
{"text":"The food is DELICIOUS!

The atmosphere and service is OK.  Kind of dirty and a big turnover of employees. 

I keep going back for the food though.  The crispy spring rolls, pho and yellow chicken curry are delicious!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that our server was friendly, friendlier than most I have had a Vietnamese restaurants. However after she took our order we did not see her again until it was time to pay the bill. There were about 6 or 7 other tables in the restaurant and other servers walked by us constantly and ignored the fact we had been done and sitting there for 15 minutes. 

Now onto the food, I got the easy rare Pho, when the Pho came out  I did not smell the usual aroma of onion, ginger and other spices that make Pho the best soup ever.  Instead I smelled salt. This was troubling. After tasting the broth I immediately knew what I was smelling and now tasting, beef bouillon. There was a very subtle flavor almost like watered down  Pho. The taste and flavor of the bouillon lingered on my tongue and left and and odd feeling in my mouth. This was probably the saddest excuse for Pho I have ever had. Real Pho requires a missive amount of bones and spices to create the broth that soothes the soul. Now onto my husband, order the charbroiled pork Bun, his vegetables were mushy the pork was not anywhere on par with other places we've been. Again watered down flavor. 

To top all of this off this place is more expensive that other Vietnamese restaurants we frequent. Save your money, visit another Vietnamese restaurants we have in the area, there are much, much, much better ones than this place."}
{"text":"My go to place for good pho. The beef rolls and the easy rare pho are my favorites. The only problem I've ever had is sometimes the soup is not hot enough to cook the meat completely-but that is a personal preference."}
{"text":"I have to say, Pho Da Lat always has the most beautiful lettuce leaves

Ordered the Vietnamese Crepe.  At $5.95 regular menu price it's a nice light \"dare I say healthy\" meal.  As the picture shows, it comes with a stack of said beautiful lettuce leaves, sprigs of mint, cucumber wedges, and a bowl of fish sauce.  The crepe itself is minimally filled with a few shrimp, a few slices of meat, spinach, scallions, and bean sprouts.  By itself it's not exactly a flavor rush, so wrap some up in the lettuce and mint, and dip it into the fish sauce.  Spice it up with The Rooster if you need to."}
{"text":"Delicious and authentic if you ask me. Been to vn and tasted pho from different region and the soup here reminds me of the street food pho."}
{"text":"I have had Vietnamese may times, and this place is easily one of the best. Pho is a bit overrated for my taste (plus soup is not something I go out for), so I wanted to try something with noodles.

I'm gluten-free so I can't eat anything wheat-based, but I can have rice, potatoes, and corn. Their rice vermicelli noodles are so good. I got the #32 which is a combo of a spring roll, marinated pork, and shrimp on a bed of room-temperature noodles (sounds weird, tastes amazing) on another bed of shredded cucumber, lettuce, mint, and basil. It comes with aside of what I believe is a fish sauce, but does not taste like fish. It's more of a sweet and savory sauce. I really liked this place, and cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"Favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Tempe ! Having to stay in Tempe for a few months for work I seriously tried almost every restaurant close by to my hotel. This place was always consistent in flavor and service. Love their pho dac biet. And eggs rolls! Comparing it to the other restaurants in the area this one will make your tummy and wallet happier!"}
{"text":"I'm feeling a little generous with this review. The food deserves 3 stars overall, but the pepper tofu is so out of this world delicious that I'm willing to bump them up to 4. As a vegetarian in Phoenix, I'm always starved for entree options, and I wish there were more dishes like this. I got this dish to go while I waited for my car to be serviced nearby, and a couple employees walked by to tell me how good my lunch smelled. I asked for it extra spicy, and the extra jalapenos added just enough heat.

I came back again with my husband to try some of their veggie pho, and I was disappointed. It was good but nothing special. My husband felt the same way about his beefy pho. We shared a plate of spring rolls, and they were so bland. Even the peanut dipping sauce had very little flavor.

We would still come back to try other dishes here. A big lure was the large wine list where all bottles are $20. The great $20 price tag puts many of the bottles right a retail cost which is awesome when you're dining out. Sign me up for some La Crema."}
{"text":"I went vegan about 10 months ago and was a little depressed about not being able to eat pho anymore, but then I discovered Pho Da Lat and their veggies pho made with veggie broth.  It is so amazing, and one of the best deals around.  $5.99 lunch special for a huge bowl of soup with tons of veggies!  And the broth is really, really tasty.  I am now addicted to this place and I go three times a week.  My family loves it too and my 11-year-old daughter loves the pho tai.  The servers are all super cool, especially Annie.  I have eaten here about 25 times and I have never had a bad experience or anything short of excellent service and great food.  I like when you order the veggies pho and they always ask whether or not you want the veggie broth - that is always a good feeling when you don't eat meat or dairy.  They have other vegan dishes as well but I have yet to try them because the veggies pho is so darn good (#16 on the lunch menu).  Definitely a good place for non-vegans too.  I wish they had vegetarian crispy egg rolls, but that is the only negative thing I can think of.  Every time I go in here it is busier and busier because the word is getting around.  My wife likes the wine selection - $6 for a glass.  The interior is really nice and pleasant - good place for a date.

Seriously, eat here.  You won't be sorry.  Man, I want to go there right now but it's only 7:30am.  Shoot."}
{"text":"Sorry Pho Da Lat .. I'm from California where the PHO is original.  Your PHO's broth is sweet and not sure why.  I ate the PHO Deluxe $8.50 (the most expensive pho i ever purchased).  However, I saw other people eating rice dishes which I'll def go back to try.  It's hard to find good asian food in AZ.  Note: If you plan on using CC than make sure you purchase more than $15 otherwise you will be charge .45 cents to process your CC."}
{"text":"I always heard about pho but never tried it. I'm so happy to have found this place! Delicious! I get the chicken pho:)"}
{"text":"I go here for lunch with friends a few times a month.  Had various types of the Pho, all delicious.  The food quality is consistently good.  Vietnamese iced coffee is very good.  I'll continue going back for a long time."}
{"text":"I've been there 3'times for lunch and each meal was delicious. This place is the real deal for Vietnamese food. The Pho portions are huge too."}
{"text":"Heres a hint

The next time a customer comes in and there is a mixup on an order...dont ask the customer \"can you pay...\" when he has a credit card and cash in his hand.  It is very disrespectful no matter how good your food may be.  I dont care if you were givng away gold bricks out of that funboy establishment i wouldnt drive by there ever again....."}
{"text":"I LOVE Vietnamese food... I am always trying new ones in every part of the valley so naturally I had to give this one a review.

Service: They can't tell you what's in the dishes... Typical to vietnamese/pho restaurants, service isn't 5-star. When I asked what was in the \"house sauce\" they told me that they didn't know and that none of the servers knew because they weren't the ones in the kitchen making it.... OK.

Food: Really good! A lot of different options. I had the #11 pho with brisket and flank steak but added rare steak. Lots of meat so that's always good. I didn't even try the broth before adding a bunch of basil, jalapeños, sriracha and chili paste so I can't comment on that. 

Drink: Their wine list is pretty great for a pho place. They also have great prices on the bottles so that's always a plus! 

I probably would eat here again if I was in the area but definitely not a place I'd go out of my way to eat at. They're also open much later than most pho so that's another reason to return."}
{"text":"My partner and I were looking for a place to get Pho that would be open until 10pm on a Friday, and found this gem!  Wonderful atmosphere - koi fish, mini waterfall, wonderfully decorated. Perfect for a date night on a budget. 

My partner had some kind of Pho with meat (beef, I think), and I had the veggie Pho. Our waitress was thoughtful enough to ask if I wanted beef or vegetable broth. 

We both received huge bowls of Pho with plenty of the condiments - mint leaf, jalapeno, lime, and bean sprouts. Our food came quickly and was piping hot. The vegetables were perfectly done - still fresh and with a crunch, but cooked through. My partner loved hers, as well (and she's one of the pickiest eaters I know when it comes to eating out!)

We walked out of there after getting two bowls of Pho, a diet Coke, and a Thai Tea and only spent $20+tip. Our waitress didn't bother us every two seconds, but was very attentive when we asked her for something - drink refill, to go box - which is how I wish all waitstaff were! We walked out of there 2 minutes until closing time, but never felt rushed. We'll definitely be stopping by again!"}
{"text":"I was craving some Pho and didn't have much time on my lunch break so I called Pho Da Lat since it was the closest.  I called ahead and ordered the #11.  
5-10 minutes they said, which was great!  
Prices were about .50-1.00 higher than most of the Pho places I've been to, but that's not bad.
The broth was delicious, they were a little skimpy on the beef, but I could deal with that.  
The problem and the reason for the lower rating was the fact that the host who brought my $7.00 pho to me asked if I needed change after giving him $10.00, Umm, scuse me?
I contemplated about posting this as I don't want to sound petty, but....
I always tip for to-go orders at sit-down restaurants, at the very least 10%, and round up.
But I was shocked this guy presumed I was going to tip 30+% on one item?? 
A little pretentious I thought.  How bout bringing my change first and let me decide if I am tipping? (which I was going to, but he seemed to be petty as well taking his sweet time bringing my change to me).  Sorry, but service goes right along with the food when it comes to rating,  This would have been a solid 4-star."}
{"text":"Tried the chicken pho and fresh garden roll. The soup base is delicious! Worth a try if you are craving for Vietnamese food like Pho. :)"}
{"text":"They are busy even on late Monday evening. We came in and we're seated promptly. The pork spring rolls were freshly prepared and were great. It was all downhill from there. The pho beef broth lacked any significant flavor and appeared to be watered down perhaps because it was getting late and they were running low, but either way, it was not good at all. Additionally, they use instant jasmine tea which should be an automatic no-no for any Asian style restaurant or any other restaurants for that matter. I chose this place based on the reviews, and was disappointed as a result. It's hard to give a restaurant another chance when flaws such as I've described exist."}
{"text":"Good pho! Pretty good service. I guess good atmosphere if your in to that type of thing."}
{"text":"Terrible restaurant! Ignored by wait staff for an inordinate amount of time until finally someone noticed we hadn't even been given menus, another wait to give our order, then after about 30 minutes more of being ignored as well as not being served we approached staff requesting to speak with a manager. Response: no manager here! We walked out, after having wasted an hour for nothing! AVOID THIS AWFUL PLACE,"}
{"text":"I am not going to say much about this place because the only thing I really liked about it were the light fixtures.

I tried the Crystal Chicken. Bland.

I tried the Crispy Sring rolls. Overcooked.

The only thing that was yummy was the #51.. and I have no idea what it was called but my friend got it and I tried it and it was pretty alright.

They have a koi pond inside right when you walk in, but I was disturbed at the size of the fish in that little pool.. Definitely not enough room, and I'm thinking this might be a violation, and i'm looking into it. I may eat fish, but I don't believe the living ones should be confined like that.. I certainly don't like elevators, do you?"}
{"text":"We have been dining at this restaurant for several years. It's been one of our favorite go-to spots for years. 

Today is no different. The staff all appear to be new. Dante was our server and he was very attentive. Our orders came out perfect - even with my special requests / modifications!"}
{"text":"We went here for dinner the other night and I had the tofu and pepper dish and my friend had the shrimp and pepper dish.  Unfortunately the order was wrong and there was shrimp cooked along with my tofu dish. If I was allergic to shrimp I would probably be dead.  I gave my shrimp to my friend and enjoyed the rest of my meal. 

Besides the slight mix up with our orders the server was very friendly and attentive. The restaurant was also very clean. I will most likely be coming back here again."}
{"text":"I've had pho all over the valley and consider myself somewhat of an enthusiast. Pho Da Lat is not the best that I've ever had but it was definitely within the top 3. Restaurant is clean, service is super friendly and quick (I appreciated this because I only had 45 minutes for my lunch break), they have a great beer/wine selection. Overall, it was a great experience and I highly recommend paying them a visit if you haven't already."}
{"text":"I wish I could put a 4.5 star. Cause a whole star is too harsh. However it doesn't deserve 5 stars... Yet.

Pho was good. Very flavorful and filling. Bit pricey but good and filling. Takes some time to refill water. But place was clean and food was good."}
{"text":"I tried pho for the first time a few months ago at a different restaurant and really liked it, so when I found Pho Da Lat, I was excited to have another big bowl of that delicious soup. I visited  here late on a Friday evening and the restaurant was not busy so I was seated fast. I liked the interior decorations and the little pond they have at the entrance. I ordered spring roles and pho and they were both good. It was not a fabulous dinner but it was fairly close to what I expected."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch, very attentive staff,  very fresh and good food!  Ready to come back again soon!"}
{"text":"Convenient since we live in Tempe and pretty good Vietnamese food.
They also have Pho with vegetarian based soup which is unusual because almost always it is a beef broth."}
{"text":"Great pho at a great price! The fresh spring rolls are the best in town. The ultimate hang over cure ;)"}
{"text":"Very delicious Pho and spring rolls the service was very quick and great prices my total was $12.36 for both!!"}
{"text":"Great service and the BEST iced coffee I've ever had... That said DO NOT... I repeat do not have more than one.  We are both seasoned coffee drinkers and we were kept up till 2:00 am 4 hrs past bed time."}
{"text":"I love the Bun here!"}
{"text":"This restaurant remains a true 5 starer! After my initial review I have returned at least 15 times. And I plan on returning many, many more. 

The food quality remains fresh and consistent. The service is always prompt and friendly. The value is unquestionable. 

Definitely try this place!"}
{"text":"Uhhhhh...Yum!! And, the service is AMAZING!!! Apparently they just doubled in size, and I can see why!! This place is great. Even though it's a little out of the way for us, we WILL be back!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best Mussels.  Best Lemonade.  Quiet, Relaxing.  Good.  Would Highly Recommend."}
{"text":"This is a great place for pho and offers a large variety of different choices. 

I've come to rate other pho's against the pho here.  They don't skip out on the spices and know how to make some of the most flavorful broth around. Meat is always fresh.

My daughter and I usually get the combo fried rice and crazy noodles. It is a lot of food for two but means lunch leftovers the next day. The combo fried rice is a perfect as a leftover.  Try it, you'll like it.

I've dined in and done take out.  I prefer dining in as the ambience is so nice but if you get it to go, they take care to package it properly.

The decor is very nice, open and most important, clean.  Check out the bathrooms, they are spotless.  Service is always friendly and prompt.

Great value, great food. Go now, thank me later."}
{"text":"Best Pho ever! Highly recommend coconut water! The whole environment great authentic Phooo! My new favorite"}
{"text":"One of the okay Pho I had coming from a Vietnamese I'm very picky, the service not so great me and my boyfriend waited to be seated but no one came out so we seat ourself but then got bitch at for doing that, maybe have a hostess if you wanted to seat people. OVER PRICED FOR PHO GO SOME WHERE ELSE WHY WOULD YOU PAY FOR OVER PRICED FOOD AND BAD SERVICE"}
{"text":"I came in here prior to getting my hair done at the salon next door.  I only got a to-go order of Vietnamese Iced Coffee but I enjoyed the decor and atmosphere of the restaurant.  The servers were all attentive to myself and to the other guests as I people watched and waited for my coffee.  I definitely plan on returning here with my boyfriend so that we can try out the foods!"}
{"text":"This is the only place I go for Pho. Best in town. Awesome service, the sweet gentleman that was our waiter carded me. they do their best to make sure we are happy and taken care of. Everything we requested that brought it in a timely manner. I'm going to tell everyone about this place"}
{"text":"Fake Americanized Vietnamese food.  Small portions and more like Chinese food than Vietnamese food.  Will never eat here again. It's nasty or gross."}
{"text":"This is the worst service I have ever experienced. The workers all sit on a crate next to the backroom,using their phones while you wait for any kind of service. Whenever I would ask for water or anything else the server walks away before I can finish my sentence. Not even any sort of acknowledgement.

I know I sound like a priss but I've worked many years in customer service so I'm very polite when I go to restaurants or any public place. But I have never experienced this level of rudeness and horrible service on multiple occasions, not just once. 

The food is decent, but the Pho only contains a baby's bite worth of noodles."}
{"text":"The food was GREAT!  A large menu with a lot of options, lots of noodle/soup combinations, Vermicelli/meat and Rice/meat dishes.  Very reasonably priced too- with appetizers our meal came to $20 (we didn't get drinks though)! appetizers start at $2.99, entree's range from $6.95 up to $12.95.

I had the Beef with Lemon-grass Chili sauce over jasmine rice and LOVED it, it was very flavorful.  This restaurant offers \"choose your own spice level 1-5\".  I ordered a 3 and there certainly was a kick to it, I like spice though and probably could have done a 4.

The atmosphere was nice and clean, good earthy colors of green and brown helped add to the clean and simple feel.  The bathrooms were the nicest and cleanest I have seen in a restaurant in YEARS.  

The only downside to the experience was the service.  The wait staff were polite and kind just dreadfully slow!  After finishing our meal we waited about 10min for someone to come check on us and offer us our check- no one came.  I had to flag down the hostess who brought us our check.  Placing our order was a lengthy process as well.  After we placed our appetizer order it seemed forever before they came back for our dinner order."}
{"text":"Pho was good and the service as well.   Was not overly impressed, but will try again."}
{"text":"Very spacious inside. The first time I went it took a while for the staff to acknowledge I was waiting to be seated. The menu options for vegans are great. Awesome pho and spring rolls. However, the first time I ordered the spring rolls without mint and I was definitely served rolls with mint. Decent pho spot super close to my house. I'll likely be a regular."}
{"text":"TLDR: Solid Pho price with average prices. It's a bit cleaner than your average vietnamese restaurant.

I've been eating A LOT of pho lately and this is one of the many places I've been to. I only eat seafood so my order is usually pretty standard. The pho itself usually doesn't have too much variation so I look at other things about the restaurant.

The price was just average compared to most pho places, nothing exceptionally cheap, but it stood out he place is a lot cleaner than most other Vietnamese places. The service was also great, they were very friendly and prompt about everything. I wanted an item that wasn't on the menu but didn't bother asking because I didn't think they would bother making a special order of spring rolls for me. My BF asked anyways and they happily accommodated."}
{"text":"Mussels didn't live up to description. Food was plain even though I ordered my dishes spicy. Totally Americanized, which means it's more bland. Waitress was pleasant & the atmosphere was nice. But for flavor it totally failed."}
{"text":"Best bun Bo hue I have had in the valley. Beyond that I can't say. I have gone for lunch 3 times, and the service was good. No issues."}
{"text":"Great, fresh food,...very healthy!!  Portions are huge and the Pho is great too.  Excellent prices.  Service is super friendly, attentive...feels like family. Atmosphere is calming, open, clean and comfortable. It's surprising that such an excellent place is in such a slow corner strip mall, but very nice.  I wish I could give another 1/2 star,.....only took a half off because the flavor is a little bland, but that may be all Vietnamese food,....this food tastes very fresh and authentic!!

Definitely the best Vietnamese food I've had of the 4 places I've been!!

Highly recommend trying it, you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Such a yummy place and quick service. Inside also looks very clean. I recommend this place to anyone in the area craving Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"This place is really nice.  It is clean, wide open and modern inside.  The Pho is pretty darn good.  Not the best in the area, but good.  The price is right especially for lunch.  Their spring rolls are always fresh and they will even sell a half order (one roll) which is nice if you go by yourself.  Have not tried the rest of the menu, but it looks like it would be worth a shot."}
{"text":"Did NOT enjoy the service here today. And this was my second time. 

Came in and the host or waitress just stood there staring at me and my friend. She didn't say one word to us. I had to tell her table for 2 please. There was NO greet from her. She sat us down and no menus were given to us from her at all. 

We sat down and no one came over to check on us. We had to wave our hands up to get someone's attention. 

Horrible horrible services but the food is good."}
{"text":"Great food. Great price! Pho Dalat is the quintesential Pho restaurant."}
{"text":"My favorite Pho place. It's within 1 mile and so delicious. Can't get enough of the mussels and beef rolls as well as the easy rare pho. I'm sure the rest of their food is just as awesome but can't steer my way from these favorites yet."}
{"text":"Typical vietnamese service, good service for the white people, and careless for other customer.  Food was ok, price is alright.  overall, the service brings their score down"}
{"text":"Always good food !, PHO DA LAT is he best in Phx , Veggie broth , Veggie Pho with steamed tofu is awesome , and don't forget to order the quail appetizer :) .."}
{"text":"Great Pho. We come here once a week. I have tried the veggie spring rolls, and the garlic chicken, all of which were great!"}
{"text":"Best place if your under the weather and needing some hot soup with Siracha! Pretty decent spring rolls and tried the mussels which were too rich for me.  All in all its our pho go to on this side of town."}
{"text":"It's now called Pho Dalat instead of Pho Sapa...
I had the Lemon Grass Chicken and it is by far the best I have ever tasted.  The spice level is somwhat weird, it's 1 through 5 and a 9...I get the 9 and it is still full of flavor and doesn't taste like all chilli sauce.

The decor is relaxing, unlike typical mom and pop places where I feel a bit uneasy, the selection is great you can tell them to cook it anyway you like, with beef or veggie etc., the price is resonable. 

The service is a bit slow, but I think that is the industy standard as far as asian cuisine goes."}
{"text":"This was my first vietnamese experience, and WOW!

I am extremely allergic to peanuts, and was worried about my allergy impeding on my culinary excursion.

However, the staff at Pho Sapa was more than accomodating, and once I showed that I knew nothing of Vietnamese cuisine, they walked me through the menu and gave me many suggestions.

For my boyfriend and I we ordered
-  Pho Special
- Lemongrass Chili Chicken
- Spring Rolls

It was all sooooooooo good.  We requested spicy level 4 (out of 5), and I actually probably could have handled the 5.

We also had the Vietnamese iced coffee, and it was so good it puts Starbucks to shame.

We ordered all the food to go, and the staff even helped carry the food out to our car with us!

Excellent experience, food, and service, we will be returning A LOT :)"}
{"text":"The food are not bad at all, it just that they not give enough meat. And when I order to go the Dalat Special Pho - they missing several of beef items on it that supposedly on it. Expect slow service during lunch hours. Other than that it's pretty good food with less meat."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise!  The first time I visited this place was about two years ago and my wife and I were very disappointed. I went there recently and discovered they had expanded and the pho tasted great!  Needless to say, I told my wife I had found a new place and brought her back and she agrees. I love that it is down the street from where I work. Now when I have a taste for pho, this is where I'll go."}
{"text":"I love the decor.  Easily in the top 2 for decor of the pho places I've visited.  Massive serving of pho.  

However, I've had better pho in other places.  The broth was very light and not too salty but it was missing something (I think someone else said this) and I will agree with the other poster about their rice dishes; that looked pretty good.  A friend had the veggie pho and that looked pretty delish, actually; and healthy.

Yes.  Bring cash."}
{"text":"Vegetarian Pho with Veggie Broth? YES PLEASE!! When you walk into the restaurant, it is a little dark. However, the pho was very flavorful! I like to add extra limes in my soup for some extra sourness. The service was great as well. When I ordered my Vegetarian Pho, the waiter immediately asked me if I wanted Veggie Broth. The only downside was that they charge $0.45 for a credit card charge of under $15. If you are going to go by yourself, make sure to take cash unless you are planning on buying two meals."}
{"text":"Over all the food was good. I had a room temperature rice dish with beef and a crispy roll. I am not normally a fan of fish sauce but theirs was good. I did not add the whole dish, I feel like it would have been too much. I did however add some sauce for additional flavor.

I also loved their iced coffee!"}
{"text":"Finally! A vegetarian - friendly pho broth. I actually tried pho for my first time a few months ago even though we have been going to Vietnamese restaurants forever. I just can't enjoy pho because I'm a vegetarian but the veggie broth is amazing. They have so many delicious, fresh veggies in the soup and I always have to get it to go. Love it here! I crave their broth all the time!!"}
{"text":"My standby place for a good healthy lunch.  Excellent pho, good bun, and the 2 daily chicken specials (summer grilled chicken and salt/pepper chicken w/rice) are fantastic.   Staff is always courteous though sometimes a little overwhelmed by the lunch crowd - especially on Fridays."}
{"text":"We came to town for Superbowl \"festivities\" and since it was a rainy and  cold night, what better than having pho for dinner. We had to order it to-go because it was almost closing time. The serving size is good and so are their prices.

The flavor is VERY good, we had the pho with tendon and brisket, and brisket and rare steak. Overall is is really good food and I would recommend it. The only asterisk would be that the pho is a bit too greasy in my opinion compared to other ones we've had in other places (El Paso, Denver, Houston, Hanoi, Saigon). But as I said, the the flavor, pricing and serving size really make up for everything. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Expensive!! Small portions, flavorless, poor presentation... Just some words off the top of my head. AND!!! They charged me an EXTRA FEE for using my debit card! There are plenty of other Pho places in the valley that are waaay better than this place."}
{"text":"I love Vietnamese food, so I just had to try this place. 

I was pleased with this restaurant. They had great food and offered lots of variety in the menu, including rice dishes, pho, buns, and more. I never tried quail but it was surprisingly good (it tastes like a saltier/chewier/bonier version of chicken if you're curious). The sauce on top of the quail topped off the appetizer - I would recommend it. We had another appetizer - the tofu spring rolls. It tasted very healthy and clean, and I liked the peanut sauce that came with it. 

I ordered the chicken \"bun\" noodles, which had rice noodles, lettuce, chicken smothered in sauce and a side of fish sauce. My friend got the vegetarian pho, which she enjoyed. 

The server checked in pretty often and were very polite and helpful with our order. While we were unfamiliar with some of the menu items (like the quail), she provided us a detailed explanation of what the appetizer would entail. I'm glad that she did, because it convinced us to get the order. Yum yum!

I went to dinner on a Thursday evening and there were quite a large amount of people in there - Pho Da Lat has good business which shows that customers regularly go to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Pho is pricey and has very little flavor. The veggies were stale and few. I had the pho special with everything in it. It was disappointing. I had been here a few years back and didn't like it but wanted to give them another shot today because I was craving some Vietnamese food. I'll stick with the good oil' Da Vang or Pho Thanh for some good pho at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I work in the area and come here maybe once a month when I have a pho craving and need a place near work.  The decor is relaxing, and the music is pleasant.  I find service to be fast which is really important during lunch.

On one side, the prices are a little on the high side, and the pho is somewhat bland.  On the other side, a lot of my American coworkers won't go to a mom and pop pho house.  Pho Dalat is somewhere they would be okay with.

If you're on that side of town.. have a pho craving.. then Pho Dalat will definitely cure that.. but don't get expected to be wow'ed by the complex flavors of the broth"}
{"text":"My FIRST Vietnamese Restaurant experience in Arizona !!

The place is very clean and welcoming. 

The waitress I had spoke perfect English and understood everything .

The food was above average but it could be that I am comparing it to a restaurant in Chicago. Lets just say I do like their food and I will return.

I took one star off because the staff was making too much noise fooling around while we were eating. After this is a serious restaurant?"}
{"text":"This place is huge inside. It has a stage. Had the Crispy Spring  rolls best I ever had in my life.  Had pho soup with shrimp and steak. Good taste and a lot of soup. I like this place has one size they don't have a small or large bowl. Prices are super cheap. Will come back here again"}
{"text":"This is a nice clean spacious place, they even have a stage area. I had to get the Pho combination #8 and it was decent, so it was avg.  Portion size was avg, but barely had any protein, which explains the price. They need to add a large bowl option. I'm willing to try other dishes, but won't be back for Pho. They also said there is a 45 cent surcharge for using a credit card, which no legit business should do. This place gets 4 stars, service and food gets a 3.5 for me."}
{"text":"I'm a fan. 

The Pho here is worth driving for. The Spring rolls are delicious. The mussels were... meh. They don't have a shake selection that you normally find at Vietnamese places, but their soups make up for it on a cold day. Mmm."}
{"text":"Come for HH, it'll allow you to eat more AND save money at the same time"}
{"text":"The Pho had too much noodles and not enough meat. The price seemed a little high for such a simple soup. 

Service was prompt and the venue is very pretty, but I would not return."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from a friend and yelped it of course.  Loved it.  Tried the Spicy Beef  Vermicelli, Summer Rolls and my hubby had the Special Pho.  Everything was great, including the service!  The beef broth on the Pho was especially tasty.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Honestly my go to place for Vietnamese food. I'd refer people to this place in a heartbeat. The staff is great and friendly. The have options for gluten free replacements which made it great to bring my girlfriend here for her first taste of Pho. Food is great and delicious."}
{"text":"Had lunch here the other day and the waitress was so bad I don't know if I will ever return!  Food was average and not compelling enough to draw me back in with such poor service. But, note is that the pho broth did not appear to from a jar!!!"}
{"text":"Not the greatest or the cheapest but they are the closest to my house and only spot in Southwest Chandler/Tukee area. So when I need a quick a fix, it's at least convenient."}
{"text":"The Fresh spring rolls awesome , I highly suggest them! I really love the seafood pho so good !! The service has always been great everytime I've gone there . always hot and fresh ! This is the place I get my Pho Fix . So if you happen to be In south Tempe , stop in to the awesome spot !"}
{"text":"This place is pretty Americanized for an \"authentic\" Vietnamese restaurant. 

The thai iced tea was served with whipped cream. Who does that? And the boba was hard, not chewey like it should be. 

We had to ask for fish sauce, red chili and chopsticks - all Vietnamese staples which should have already been on the table. I am leery of any \"authentic\" Asian restaurant where the patrons are only expected to eat with forks. 

My husband ordered the ginger clam dish. (I attached a photo) Unfortunately, it was all presentation and no substance. The dish was beautiful, but there were more shells than clams. My husband is a big man and five tiny clams just didn't fill him up.

As far as Vietnamese food goes, Khai Hoan still has my heart."}
{"text":"Ive been here more than a few. Ive read alot of reviews saying service is excellent haha either they had a little too much wine or ive been with all the bad waiters and waitresses. 
Food 4 stars and Service -1 stars. Come for the food everyone! But dont expect good service."}
{"text":"Clean, fast, great service. 

This is my go-to spot for lunch!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is very clean, but the broth is diluted, overall it is an ok vietnameese place."}
{"text":"I've been trying different Pho places throughout the Chandler area. Pretty descent spot. Tried the soup. Broth was very flavorful. Bowl was a little small. Wish they had size options. Good food though. Will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Really Good Pho, Kind Of Skimpy Serving Size

To start this review off the broth is rather exceptional. The flavor is so good that by the time you're done with the broth you're wondering where the rest of your food is. 

There isn't a lot of meat and even the noodle portion could've been a little bit more. I like when places have the extra large bowl option because I'm a big guy and like to eat a lot.

I felt like the service was nominally all right, but when it came time to pay I had to keep waving my money around in order to get someone to come let me pay so I could go.

I feel like I want to give a 3 1/2 star rating on this place but in all fairness because the broth is so good I gave it a four star. If you're not a huge eater you will think the portion is perfect."}
{"text":"So the food was decent, the service was absolutely terrible and I was charged for a soda when all I got was carbonated water... I asked why and the poor waiter said that when they don't charge for it, the owner takes it out of their check.. Are you kidding me? Not like I needed 2 dollars, and not like it was a big deal but it was when the waiter told me about the owner. I will never be back and don't recommend. It looks like they are struggling anyways so good luck attempting to obtain clients with the way you practice  your business and treat your employees. If you are the owner, and you want to reach out to me and talk about it let me know. I'd love to give you a piece of my mind."}
{"text":"This place is one of the best places where I tried Vietnamese food. The waitress was energetic and very friendly.  I tried vegetarian pho and thai iced tea, Both were amazing.  The Vietnamese pho tasted really good and the quantity was huge. Its a lot for the money you pay and I am sure 1 person cannot finish the bowl."}
{"text":"My wife and I eat here as often as we can. Love the beef rolls. The service is always good. Unfortunately I can never remember the name of the dish I get. Usually one of the bowls with noodles, fish sauce, pork and crispy spring roll in it or some variation of that dish. We love it."}
{"text":"The food was really good, but service was slow. They have two servers and about 5 tables when I was there. I ordered a Pho noodle, before I got my check, my server never came to ask how's everything like other restaurant did.a little disappointed."}
{"text":"One simple word for you.... BUN... This is my go to dish on a  hot summers day, my mouth is watering right now just thinking about the cool, crisp, deliciousness. Living in Tempe there are probably 5 Vietnamese restaurants within a 4 mile radius of my house, most of them are mediocre at best. So I decided to drive out of my normal Tempe hood and check this place out. I am the takeout queen... having an active 2 year old makes it hard for me to actually sit down in a restaurant and enjoy my meal, so I opt for takeout 99% of the time. I ordered the Bun with chicken, and a side of spring rolls. The customer service was awesome, the ladies were super nice. While waiting my son enjoyed watching the little koi pond they have. Back to the food.. It was very good! The bun was perfect temperature, the fish sauce was the perfect balance of salty and sweet, and when I asked for extra sauce they gave me a ton without flinching.  The spring roll were amazing, probably some of the best I have had in the valley. This is my new favorite close Vietnamese place, maybe soon I will try the pho since it seems to get pretty good reviews!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Here's a picture of the food we got here. Oh wait.. it was too Good and disappeared quickly. 

Bubba is the best ever!"}
{"text":"The Bun Bo Hue is fantastic here.  :)  The ambiance is nice, decorations are cute, and service is great."}
{"text":"Yeah this place is not the best for Pho... Got the Pho Gah (chicken)... never again. Bad service, boring broth, stale tasting spring rolls, dry ass chicken, and barely any vegetables to put in the Pho.  Idk what the other menu options taste like, but as far as the Pho is concerned, go somewhere else like Pho Thanh (They are cheaper and taste way better).  You can go and try this place if you want, but you could also spend your money and get a better value elsewhere.."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant two times and the the pho is great. The menu at first glance seems pretty expensive, $5 for two egg rolls, appetizers, etc. But if you come during their weekday happy hour (something like M-F 3pm-5pm) the appetizers are half off, which makes them \"normal\" priced as far as Vietnamese joints go. What you pay for is the nice atmosphere, everything is very clean, and the decor is very nice, and modern. 

The bowls of pho are around $9-$10 which is expensive, but the bowls are actually fairly large so it evens out. My first impressions of this restaurant were that it was far too expensive to be a Vietnamese restaurant, but after seeing the large portions of pho and bun bo hue, I'd recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Hidden from the main street this cozy Pho restaurant has surprised me with warm welcoming and savory Pho. I ordered the buck-choy and I approve of their cooking.

The combination won-ton soup is to die for when mixed with lime.

The roasted duck soup is delicious and the noodles have absorbed the rotisserie roast flavor of the duck. Complimented with mushroom add hot sauce for a nice kick.

Pho is a must at this place. Customer service is nice and attentive.  I approve."}
{"text":"Pho-gettaboudit... not impressed, the spring rolls were over-cooked and the chicken in the pho was no bueno.  The others at my table seemed to enjoy their meal, but I think they're just used to being let down.

Also, let me stand on my soap box and announce something to all small business owners.  You don't like it when people pay with credit or debit cards?  You don't like paying that 3-4.5% fee for electronic paying customers?  Huh.  Well guess what... you should build that into your pricing!  'Cause guess what?  NO ONE likes to see a sign that they will be paying 50 cents or whatever extra just because they don't have cash.  It rubs me the wrong way almost every time - and I know I'm not the only one.  

So - in the best interest of your getting people to RETURN and RECOMMEND your place of business to others?  Get with the 21st century and suck it up - debit / credit cards aren't going anywhere."}
{"text":"Great place! Chin Pho was awesome, both kids loved it. I had mine with a little Thai basil, jalapeño, lime & hoisin sauce...yum! Crispy noodle stir fry was great also, gotta let the noodles soak up the sauce! Cheapest family meal we have had. Our waitress was really helpful with recommendations!"}
{"text":"Yummy!  I ordered the Bun Bo Hue soup extra spicy.  It worked wonders on my cold, and it was delicious!  Lots of beef, pork and meatballs in it.  The spice was almost too hot, so next time I will order it just \"hot\".   My hubby ordered the flank and brisket pho and it was also very good.  We shared the spring rolls.  They were okay, a little greasy for my taste.  The place was closing down the following day 8/13 for a remodel.  I am counting the days until 8/21 for the re-opening.   It was a very nice friendly and clean place.  We will go back!"}
{"text":"I can Pho-give this place for decent service.  Granted, my group of 8 was the only one around that quiet night.  My Pho was pretty good, I think I finished before everyone around the table, but I have a big mouth.  Everyone else seemed to enjoy their food or maybe it was just good company :)  I love the decor; felt like I walked into one of my old school relatives homes - tacky Asian art with a modern twist.  They have a small wine selection, wow!  Never really gone into a Pho place with a plethora of wine!  Maybe next time I feel like eating Pho and talking about my failed relationships I'll be back ;-P enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great food! We were greater quickly upon arriving. Once we ordered, the food do not take a very long time to arrive. Food presentation is great!

4 star because the fish pond at the front is very dirty and the koi fish in there, you can barely see."}
{"text":"Great service, a little slow at lunch hour which is understandable. Definitely will come back for some pho"}
{"text":"i thought i'd give this place a shot, even with the \"meh\" Yelp reviews. I like to be the Yelper that proves everyone else wrong! or something like that.  went at the end of the lunch rush.... and no one was at the hostess station. so i stood there for a good few minutes before being noticed and seated.

since i was planning on ordering spring rolls, i stopped by the restroom to wash my hands .... and was DISGUSTED at the squalor.  yes, i just said squalor. it was that bad. filthy. 

i had the nem nuong cuon (grilled pork sausage spring roll). it was decent, but definitely not the best i've ever had. 

i was all excited to try the bun (vermicelli noodles), because the waitress told me a i could get 1/2 chicken and 1/2 beef.... the meat was oily, sparse, and..... just lackluster, which is strange because all of the ingredients were there.... it just fell so short of the mark. 

i then proceeded to wait for 10-15 minutes for my bill. well for anyone to come pick up my empty dishes and bring my bill. AND... does this bother anyone else but me? they give you the bill in an AmEx folder thing that says \"we take AmEx\" and then... they tell you they don't take it. anyways, i had to wait another few minutes to have my card picked up so i could pay and get out of there. 

were there warning signs? yes, and i should have listened. such as the overall Yelp reviews were pretty bad. there were pretty much NO other Asians in the restaurant - it was filled with middle-aged businessy white-folk. And the decor was trying too hard to be upscale. sigh, so disappointing. too bad."}
{"text":"This place needs to seriously clean their koi pond! The musty algae stench as I'm sitting down by the hostess section is pretty gross!  Other than that the food is decent.  I wish they wouldn't charge an extra 45 cents for debit card purchases under $15.  I tip less because of this."}
{"text":"I give this place 4 stars, due to price.
The food is great! Have had many many things on their menu, all were good. Fresh garden rolls are my favorite.

But prices are HIGH. I only come here when I'm on an expense account."}
{"text":"Very flavorful Pho! Spring rolls were Awesome! Interior is super nice! Reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"The place is clean with old school Asian decorations.  It is big for a Pho place.  The service was great.  Got soy bean milk, yum!  Got the Beef and Chicken Pho with extra noodles.  The soup base was pretty good.  The egg rolls were good too!"}
{"text":"My mom and I came to lunch here my mom ordered a bowl of pho she took 2 bites and found a cockroach in her soup we told the waiter and he apologized and offered her a new bowl and she said no thank you and she still had to pay for her food."}
{"text":"Their price is not too bad. 
But the curry dish is surprisingly bad; no flavor.
Will not go back; will not recommend."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great pho, fast and they pack on a lot of ingredients."}
{"text":"Pho is way over priced for it being mediocre. Take the time to drive a few miles more into east mesa/tempe to get better pho that is more authentic. We've eaten there and it's ok but don't even brother ordering it to go as they barely give you any broth."}
{"text":"Pho is one my favorite lunchtime eats.  I used to work on the west side of Phoenix where there are more choices of Vietnamese restaurants.  Pho DaLat was my first venture on the east side.  It's a great location off of Kyrene and Elliot Road and is upscale compared to your typical mom and pop shops over on the west side.  Good staff and fast service.  My problem was that food was not that great.  Not bad either, but not as flavorful as I've had elsewhere.  The Pho broth was a little weak even though there was plenty of meat in the bowl.  The veggies were limited to a small handful of sprouts and some fresh basil.  I would have love to have some mint and cilantro as well other leafy greens to throw into the steaming broth.  Just a bit skimpy for my tastes.  The spring roll were decent, but again missing something..  The menu itself seemed to skimp on other Vietnamese fairs.

Anyhow, not the worst, but not the best.  I'll continue to search out for a better bowl of Pho on the East Side..  My adventure continues..."}
{"text":"My review is for our Togo experience. 
We are used to 4 egg rolls at pho places so we're surprised there are only 2 per order. The pho portions are small, though the meat is fresh. Noodle usually heaping at other places.  Maybe 2/3 cup here.

No hoison, or Sriracha in the Togo bag, not even utensils.  Won't be back. Sorry."}
{"text":"Now before I go on with my review, I am originally from Northern California which is a Vietnam mecca (San Jose, CA), therefore there are pho joints on every corner. I've been to the good, the bad, and the ugly places, Pho Da Lat was somewhere in the middle. Not too bad, but OK.

I was craving some good Pho and my brother who has been living here for 9 years recommended this Pho place in town, Pho Da Lat. He praises this spot and I somewhat trust his intuition, sort of. So I gave it a try!

First off, they sell bubble drinks here (aka boba, tapioca drinks) and they were very good. You have a list of flavors to choose from and I tried their mango boba drink and it was delicious, now onto the actual Pho....

The broth, which is the main pull to my love for Pho was actually a little bland and not flavorful. Honestly, this is the foundation to a great Pho, you have a good broth, all else will be excellent! The broth was okay, nothing special. Also I didn't get receive much beef, it was actually quite sparse. My mother ordered a seafood Pho and she only had like 3 or four shrimps in hers, NOTHING. I will give them props for the spring rolls which were pretty good, I strongly recommend those if you try this place. The service was VERY good, the server was very friendly, helpful and patient! The restaurant itself was very clean and professional looking. I will go back, if my brother invites me again, lol."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The wait staff is super attentive and not over bearing as well. They let me eat my meal, but also noticed when I needed something right away. The inside is so nice. The decoration really creates a nice atmosohere. I ordered the seafood pho and it was the perfect proportion. I didn't feel like I was overwhelmed with noodles and they had enough meat in it to keep me satisfied. Their boba and cafe su da (Vietnamese coffee) was delicious as well. I've been looking for a new favorite pho place and I think this might be it!!"}
{"text":"This is some of the best vegetarian pho out there.  It is so flavorful and delicious.  The veggies you get with it are perfect.  I have been to some other places where the veggie selection in the pho is lacking, but not here.  My man (a meat-eater) even gets the veggie broth because he actually likes it better.  (He does add some rare beef to it though).

The staff is always extremely friendly and accommodating.  

Happy hour is good.  I recommend the spring rolls, which are around $3 with happy hour.

You can certainly leave here happy, full, and with money still in your wallet."}
{"text":"Consistent, consistent, consistent. Every time. That's all I can ask for in a restaurant. No wonder I've been ordering takeout here every week for the past year. Great spring rolls!"}
{"text":"We came in for lunch in the middle of the week so it wasn't busy. I wanted to try it out because I've visited the town that the restaurant takes its name after in Vietnam. (Visit that town if you're ever there. Very pretty.) We were helped right away and the service was pretty standard. The lady that helped us spoke Vietnamese so that made ordering more authentic for any of you individuals that are Viet. 

The atmosphere was pretty casual as you are greeted with a small koi pond and water fountain with top 40 music playing overhead. The restaurant has many tables and booths so it's ideal for big groups. And the lighting is medium so it's not too dark. It's fairly clean inside though for a slow afternoon lunch hour, there were tables from previous patrons that were not cleaned for awhile after we got seated. 

My girlfriend ordered a vegetarian spring roll and I ordered a \"Pho Dac Biet\" or a pho special. It has all the meats and fillings. My first choice whenever I visit a pho restaurant for the first time. They were a little skimpy on the fresh vegetable dish for your pho. The broth was ok. And the sliced beef wasn't freshly prepared. But overall the pho was still pretty tasty. It was just enough to fill you up. We stayed there for almost a couple hours afterwards to chat and were not bothered by the staff in any way. And they kept refilling our drinks so that's a plus. So all in all, not the best pho in town but I would return to try their other authentic dishes."}
{"text":"Family dinners are awesome here. First time I ever tried quail and it was awesome! I always order the pork plate, and their soup always makes me feel better when I'm sick. The fish sauce that comes with it smells funny, but tastes really good. I use soy sauce to even the flavor, always on the table!"}
{"text":"I've tried about 5 Thai places so far. I've come to a conclusion that Yellow Curry is my thing! Thats of course what I ordered. My gf got the Pho Tai. We also got the garlic Clams I think. The curry was a solid 2/5, and the Pho Tai, neither of us liked. The clams tasted great, but only about 1 of 3 clams, had something in them. They were all SHELLS! That is what really got to me, especially with the price tag for those guys. I feel as if i spent an equivalent amount of money on grade A Thai place, but had no satisfaction. I don't think I'll be coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Has become a twice a week lunch for me! The service is great and the pho is delicious! I wish the portions were larger, but other than that it's perfect!"}
{"text":"This is go-to place for us for lunch. My wife loves pho and i always order combination fried-rice. It is almost like fast-food and very delicious. The pho soup is really nice and the fried rice is superb. We never had bad experience there except the service was slow(our server disappeared for a while) few times. The price is cheap and we will go there again."}
{"text":"Very large dining room and fairly clean.  Y husband had the Pho with brisket and flank.  I had the veggie pho and added beef.  We also had the pork spring rolls.  The flavor was good and portions large.  We would come again for the Pho."}
{"text":"Update 2/2016

We used to eat here weekly; not anymore.  We got a stomach bug. The service got worse and worse, our regular nice waitress left, and it was basically long faces on the folks who remained.  The place is dirty--dirty walls by the tables, with food encrusted on the walls from months ago. Super dirty floors by the entrance and below the booths. I think the kitchen is the same, but after getting a stomach bug we decided not to come back anymore.

***********

We really enjoyed our meal here.  Food was delicious and fresh and RAPIDLY PREPARED.  Very nice ambiance; well-decorated and comfortable.  Equally as good as the other Pho restaurants we've frequented here in the valley - and the price is right.  $24 for 2 people, no drinks, ate until we were full.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"There's absolutely nothing bad to say about this place. My boyfriend works nearby, and he's nice and Asian, so it's always a great place for us to meet up and grab a bite.

The Pork Vermicelli is awesome, but I stick with the traditional Pho. And, if you're in the mood for coffee, try the Vietnamese Coffee, it's got such a great twist with condensed milk."}
{"text":"Let me preface by saying I was born in Saigon.  I understand Pho like a redneck understands buckshot.  That's to say, both can be a total miss or to die for.  But, on average they both tend to hit the target.  People who get all worked up over whether the broth was too cloudy, or too sweet, or they got one lime instead of 2 limes need to loosen up a little about this treasured Vietnamese dish.  Pho Da Lat's pho is pretty average in a city where all pho is pretty average.  So I'm saying it's a good showing for pho in Phoenix.  So why 4 stars?  

Two reasons: 

1) The roast game hen is simply perfect.  It's not a typical dish in any Vietnamese restaurant and transports one to idyllic Provence.  Evidence of the French colonial influence.  It's charred and crispy on the edges and succulent in the meaty areas.  It's served over white rice and accompanied by cucumbers, cilantro and lettuce.  A small dish with salt/pepper & lime is for dipping.  

2) These guys have a selection of wine.  Wine with Pho unheard of you say?  Don't pair with red wines, instead pick a dry white wine.  I chose the 2009 Farrier Alexander Valley Andiron (Semillon/Sauv Blanc) $6.  The hints of lime and bright finish go perfectly with spicy Pho broth.  It's also excellent with the roast bird.  

The Pho and the Andiron are good by themselves but together they transcend."}
{"text":"Huge fan of this place! The service is good and the food and iced coffee is even better. Love it and highly recommend."}
{"text":"The pho and roasted hen are my favorites . The only turn off's here are the extra pricing to get fried rice and the portions of the fried rice they give even for dinner . 

Other wise if you go with the traditional pho you can't go wrong"}
{"text":"The food was good. The server: Thai was very nice and kind. He had a sense of humor. I liked his attitude. Overall, this pho place is good and they have the best garden rolls I've ever tasted!"}
{"text":"Live right around the corner, and have eaten here weekly, sometimes more, for several years.  I have a debilitating allergy issue with MSG. I have recently had issues with foods from this restaurant, the pork products, in particular.  The 'pork' in the spring rolls has clearly changed to a product ( spam?), as well as the pork used in simple dishes - pork and rice plate.  Very sad the quality of ingredients and cooking has changed. Just can't eat at one of my favorite place any longer"}
{"text":"I am a pho phanatic, and this place hits the spot!  It's so cheap and such a great portion that I usually share with the kids.  The broth is so tasty, not overpowered by cinnamon or anise or salt.  I do miss the side of cilantro that other pho places include....But this is quick and satisfying and cheap.

My journey to find the yummiest pho is not complete, but this place is great and tops my list, especially considering it's so close to home.

Another favorite are the beef roll appetizers.  It's thin meat, marinated in like hunan sauce, filled with caramelized onions and rolled info a little finger food and served with some dipping sauce.

All the other dishes I've tried have been good, although when you say spicy it doesn't really come out \"spicy\".

They do charge a convenience fee for totals of $10 or less if you're paying with credit card, the staff is always friendy and the place is clean with a very low key atmosphere.  The kids love the fish pond at the entrance."}
{"text":"Love this place and have been coming for years! I have never had a bad meal but I mostly go for the Pho."}
{"text":"I'm generally easily pleased when it comes to Vietnamese food, but this was truly terrible. From the food to the service to the rudeness of the manager when I expressed my unhappiness, I left really unhappy and unsatisfied. We ordered the pork spring rolls , grilled pork vermicelli and pho with beef and meatballs. The rice paper on the spring rolls was not fresh or soft. The pork in the vermicelli bowl was tasty, but there was hardly any of it in proportion to the noodles and salad. The meatballs in the pho were rubbery and the broth was hardly a lukewarm temperature with a strange taste. When we expressed to the manager that the pho was not good, he told us it's always made with the same thing and his repeat customers like his food. He refused to take it off the bill and just kept offering to give us another bowl of pho....from the same batch. Prices are good here and the restaurant is nice, but with plenty of other vietnamese restaurants in the area that are great, I would strongly recommend against going here."}
{"text":"I've tried a lot of Vietnamese places and so far this is the one I keep coming back to. Everyone is in a friendly mood and the service always seem to be good, even if it's busy. 

Everything I have ever ordered has been great! This time I ordered #36, which is basically pork, rice, over easy egg, egg cake and cucumber slices. The meat was lean and marinated well. The only thing I didn't really like was the egg cake, never have... So not there fault. My friend ordered #39, grilled chicken and rice. It was her first time eating there and she loved it too. She is always picky about her food, but she was pleased with the outcome. 

So overall it was a great experience!! Plus they have my favorite, Vietnamese coffee!! =)"}
{"text":"It was so delicious! Kevin the server was so nice and attentive. Absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for lunch for a few years now.  Service is always fast and friendly.  Their Pho is incredible but don't pass up their rice dishes.  They are equally delicious."}
{"text":"Pho Da Lat was a great impromptu lunch decision on a Saturday afternoon when I had an hour or so to kill with a friend. 2pm on a Saturday almost no one was in there, which I like. 

We were immediately led to a table and given menus. The staff gave us enough time to look over our menus and think of any questions we wanted to ask in our heads first. When we finally ordered, we decided to try the quail appetizer and then each had questions on dishes. In response to my guest's questions, samples were brought out to try, which I thought was excellent.

I asked their opinion in regard to the best of the spicy flavorful dishes and it was suggested I try the lemongrass chili chicken which I did. 

Unfortunately, our food came out and our appetizer was forgotten about. However, the food was plenty and I ended up not even being able to finish it all anyway. The spice was right on par and we both seemed to enjoy our lunch there. 

I will be back again, as I found several dishes I wanted to try, which is the key to high rating and return visit with me, and hopefully next time I will try the 40+ advertised wines. All at once you ask? Hmmm... let's see where the night goes..."}
{"text":"One of the only Pho places I go to here in the Phoenix area. Service is great, food is better!"}
{"text":"This is now our favourite Vietnamese restaurant in Phoenix. Great service. Very friendly, efficient and helpful with the menu. Portions were large and tasty. We highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Ok, i am going to apologize in advance to all those nice folks who like this place - you got jeeped!!! 

This was one of the MOST unappetizing lunch i had in the looong time. Cold rice, bland chicken, non-friendly service, somewhat expensive. \"Not spicy 'nogh fo' yo? I bring hot sauce!\" HUH? WTF. I do not want hot sauce, i want properly prepared dish. 
I never came back and neither i intend to .

\"I no like\"

Eugene"}
{"text":"This is some great Vietnamese food in the Chandler/Ahwatukee area. They have great Pho choices among many other dishes. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I love vietnamese food and decided to give this place a try since my favorite \"hole in the wall\" joint closed down. I had the steak pho, crispy spring rolls and bun (vermicelli) which were all pretty good and flavorful! The service was great, but I was a little disappointed with our drinks. My Thai iced tea was watery and the boba had a heavy flavored creamer taste to it. Overall, I will come back, but I'm still on the lookout for a new hidden gem."}
{"text":"Crispy spring rolls were fantastic, super crispy wrapper and awesome flavor, and plated with plenty of romaine leaves and basil.  One order came with 2 rolls, and a bit pricey at $4.95.

I love a good hearty pho, and went for the DaLat special pho.  Broth was pretty good if you enjoy it lukewarm... at least heat it up enough to wilt the basil and bean sprouts.  Besides, any respectable Pho shop would have a jar of chili oil on every table instead of having to ask for it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place.  Food is great, friendly services and owner is really nice."}
{"text":"This place has THE BEST pho in town. The veggie broth is my favorite being a vegetarian.  I have never left here feeling dissatisfied or hungry. I highly recommend trying it out. The wait staff is always friendly and always has a smile on their faces."}
{"text":"My girlfriend introduced me to this place. I must say it's pretty clean and the food tastes great. I'm not always in the mood for soup but when I am this pho is great!"}
{"text":"How weird is that. I think Tonia B. may of been sitting at the table over from us during lunch!

The rolls have improved since my last visit. They were no longer greasy, hopefully last time was a fluke. The pho was awesome. I have never had a bowl of pho with so much meat in it. This time I got the #9 which was $1 more than the rest...maybe that's why.

Anyways, it was a very good lunch!"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time tonight.  I enjoyed the experience, friendly staff, nice clear restaurant. I ordered the Pho Tai (Rare Beef Pho) and it was mediocre.  Not terrible but if you're craving incredible Pho this isn't the place for you."}
{"text":"Ok, I'll admit I wasn't super impressed the first time I got take out from this place. But after dining here a few times I have definitely become a fan. The decor is much cooler than what you would expect from the outside. They have done their best to make it look classy but still comfortable and low-key. I like the koi pond, that is pretty cool.  And the pho is much better when it is served fresh. I like the fact that they have so many different options. I had the seafood one tonight and it was very tasty and extremely filling.  As others have mentioned, their fresh spring rolls and those beef rollup thingys are winners too.

Add to all that the selection of affordable wines by the glass and tasty boba smoothies and that's it, I'm hooked. I love the fact that the menus have detailed explanations of the items so that if you aren't that familiar with Vietnamese cuisine you wont sound dumb asking a bunch of questions. The servers are all friendly, though, and seem to take pride in the place. So, I'm sure they'll answer any questions you want. :-)"}
{"text":"Excellent Pho. #11 is great. Clean place with great service. Entrees are reasonability priced. Good all around family or date night stop."}
{"text":"Pho Da Lat serves up all your favorite Vietnamese dishes such as pho, spring rolls, rice dishes, and vermicelli. We had some spring rolls and I ordered a shrimp vermicelli dish. The spring rolls were excellent. They had the perfect balance of ingredients and had a light, fresh taste. 

The vermicelli was filled with the rice noodles, shredded lettuce, bean sprouts, and grilled shrimp. Overall, it was good and had a nice balance of textures and flavors and I especially enjoyed the grilled flavor of the shrimp.

The atmosphere is nice, with a koi pond and elegant decor.

I'll definitely dine here again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"The Pho is delicious. They have a stage and a huge wine menu. The place is very large and always busy. Definitely a place we frequented."}
{"text":"We actually were surprised there was a Pho in Tempe, AZ. Of course we had to try it out. This was one of the fanciest vietnamese restaurant we've eaten in. It was very clean and I loved the seating arrangements with the booths and the ceiling was decorated with fancy lighting which dimmed the restaurant. It felt like a romantic lit dinner for my husband and I. One thing I also loved was THEY HAD HAPPY HOUR FOR APPETIZERS! (It was only for certain hours in the afternoon) who does that? THIS place of course =0)

We had two orders of fresh spring rolls that only came in 2 long rolls cut in half. I think they could of added another one, they actually don't give much. We also had an order of fried egg roll, it was delicious. The wrapper was a little different than most egg rolls. It had a bubbly crispy texture but good. Prices for the appetizers were kind of expensive, so its best to go when its happy hour.. but over all well worth it.

When you order the pho noodle soup, its always about the broth that makes a noodle soup taste good and this was really good! Had a beefy & sweet flavor to it. I had to add a little salt, but other than that, it was good! The mediums size pho bowl was pretty big, so it was just right for me. 

The waitress and staff was great. They were very prompt and friendly to us. They checked up on us every so often to make sure we were doing okay and thats what I call customer service. If only all the pho spots had manners and decorations like them, but thats what makes them stand out! Sooo Pho Dat!!!"}
{"text":"I tried this for the first time last week.  I was VERY happy.

Having lived in Asia for a few years, it was great to find a Vietnamese place with good flavor.  Portions were good, broth was piping hot and tasty, and the peppers and condiments made for excellent authenticity. Downright delicious to say the least...

I had the sliced beef pho BTW.   I will be returning and I can recommend it with two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Super yummy Thai restaurant. I played it safe and had the pho, which was delicious. The spring rolls were a table pleaser. My companions had nothing but good things to say about their dishes. Good value for the money. Service was a little slow, but you have to expect that when it's busy. We will be back."}
{"text":"My friend really wanted some Pho so we found this place on yelp. Not a great decision. The prices are decent and the food was nice. The service was horrible. The waiter rotate between staring at us, playing with other coworkers, and hiding from us in the back. We askdd for oyster sauce and it took him like 10 minutes to bring it to us. We were the only table that he had."}
{"text":"Brought my family here the other night for dinner.  The Pho broth was on point.  Flavorful.  The rice dish, their \"special\" I believe, was not particularly tasty for us or our kids.  

The reason for the 3, and not 4 starts, is the price.  A regular bowl of Pho costs you somewhere between $10-12.  Couple that with an order of spring rolls or other entrees for the family, and you wonder whether a night out for Pho should be costing that much."}
{"text":"Always in search for Pho. I tried this place with a friend for a late lunch. Our waiter was excellent, very friendly, very attentive. We ordered appetizer #1Crispy Spring Rolls (pork, mixed veggies) served with lettuce, mint, fish sauce and #2 Fresh Garden Rolls (shrimp, pork, mint, bean sprouts, rice noodles), both were very good. Oh course we ordered Pho, #14 Tendon & Tripe Pho and #9 Easy Rare Pho both served with condiment vegetables. The Pho was very good, fresh ingredients, the broth was prefect. My only comment would be more meat and tripe please. Other than that.

Excellent service, good food for a great price. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Oh, where to begin. While the food we had was good, the service, though friendly, was just atrocious! Not only did they....bring out the entree's first (Bun) and forget the garden rolls, they gave the wrong dishes to each, brought the dipping sauce for the appetizer we didn't get, told her to bring fish sauce for each of our Bun bowls, brought only one out, had to get another, had to ask for chopsticks, hoisan sauce and chili sauce. On the bright side, the bowls were very tasty and fresh. However, another gripe is the very high prices. I've eaten Vietnamese food at dozens of places and this was by far the priciest. A Vietnamese iced coffee was $4.50 that was maybe 25 cents worth of ingredients. Most other places it's $2-2.50 tops! You get a small, maybe three-four ounces of coffee dripping into a glass with sweetened condensed milk. Literally filled the glass of ice only half full. The Bun, which usually costs between $4-6 no matter where you go, was $10.95 to $12.50! Insane. Our waitress asked if we wanted separate checks, which we did, and when the check came, both receipts were wrong. The woman sitting next to us was also taking her waiter to task for bringing her the wrong dish twice. This seems to be a pattern here. At these prices, they need to raise the level of their service."}
{"text":"This is a good Pho place with average Pho, average atmosphere, decent service, and very clean. Not my favorite but close to home. Perfect for lunch as Pho is about $6 a bowl. Dinner is a bit pricey. Been here several times and always a good honest bowl of Pho. Egg rolls are pretty good too. Spring rolls are really good."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Food was fresh and delicious. Would definitely recommend for Someone looking for a good Vietnamese restaurant in Tempe"}
{"text":"Highly recommended!  I ate pho combination. First, the broth so tasty but light. And service was amazing, fast, friendly. 
Then I ordered to go tofu fried spicy chef specialty (I think). It was awesone!!!"}
{"text":"Good pho and friendly service.  Great wine selection as well, good prices even off of happy hour.  That being said this place would be a  steal during HH, looking forward for an opportunity to go back, a little far from where I live but a great spot for sure.  One question: Did this place exist as a former night club?  What is with all of the dance and DJ equipment?? This would be a great place to be introduced to Vietnamese food as I was years back."}
{"text":"I am of Vietnamese blood. I was, however, born in the USA. I grew up eating my parents' Vietnamese food and am used to real Vietnamese food. That being said, Pho Dalat has some of the realest Vietnamese food I have had on the East Valley of Arizona. 

I have only had their Pho, but it is spectacular. Fresh tasting broth, noodles that looked like it just came out of the boiling pot, nice cuts of meat, you name it. Really good portion to price ratio. The value is really good on this Pho. Can't speak for the other dishes though. 

The service is also good. Yeah, it takes a little while to get your food to you, but it's worth the wait. The owner is very nice. The wait staff are friendly, but not in a fake way. 

Overall, I would recommend this place. Food is great and service is nice."}
{"text":"Fantastic Pho and service. I went during off hours so it wasn't busy, not sure how things are during busy hours. 

Staff was very knowledgable too."}
{"text":"Would give this place 0 stars but that wasn't an option... The first indication of something wrong was that the place was empty, I think there were 3 other tables being waited on. The food is more expensive then other pho places I've been to. They also don't offer a kids bowl of pho. The food was ok. I ordered oxtails which were $14 but only had 4 miniscule pieces of oxtail the flavor was light but good. The worse part was that my daughter ordered a bowl of pho and they never brought it out to her, my husband and I were nearly finished and still no pho for my child (she was eating off of my husbands plate) we asked our waiter and he said he thought we ordered something in place of the pho (which never happened) he brought out the pho and I asked if the restaurant would cover the pho because we all were done and my daughter still wanted the pho. He said \"You ordered it you can pay, or we can take it\" I asked for the manager, she came out but she didn't speak much English. When I finished explaining what happened she ended up communicating the same thing our waiter stated. They never took ownership of the mistake or tried to make things right. After that exchange we sat and waited another 30 mins while our daughter finished her food. We left having spent $60 on mediocre food and horrible customer service. My family will never come back!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here six times in the past year and can say that the quality of food and service has been consistent each time. Standard fare as far as Pho is concerned. I have not eaten here for lunch but dinner portions have been enough to take home for a second meal.

The spicy beef vermicelli is very good if you aren't in the mood for Pho. You can choose from 1-5 for the level of spice in the dish. If you like it hot then 4 is very good but I don't think a 5 would cause much trouble if you're feeling risky. Also, the garden spring rolls are worth getting if only for the peanut dipping sauce that accompanies them. 

Altogether a good place with a nice atmosphere and attentive service.

------
Update Feb '13:
Five years later and I'm still a regular. The Combination Bun Tom has quickly become a summer favorite and the pho supplies me with a warm soup fix on \"cold\" (Phoenix cold) days. I'll even stop by and purchase a big container of pho broth to sip on if I'm feeling under the weather. I'm happy have this place in the area since good asian food is generally reserved for Mesa and I'm not alway in the mood for that trek!"}
{"text":"Great Pho. Well above average. But not really super over the top great. Just very good. Great service."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times it's always been good. I went there Friday and got my usual number 8 Pho special... Well as I was eating I saw a piece of hair in my bowl I was done.. I let the waiter know and I love that they did just brush it off. He told the manager and they took the bowl off my bill and offered me a new one togo. Most places will just have a oh well that sucks attitude, but the way they handled it I will still go there and eat. Thank You!!!"}
{"text":"Service was crappy........they sat us way in the back corner while everyone was up front.... they barely paid any attention to us . Only reason it has two stars is because the Thai tea was good"}
{"text":"I used to work near here and used to come all the time. I stopped coming because I found a new spot for Pho but my new spot shut down so now I'm back. 

I used to love their Shrimp fried rice but I can really tell they don't put the time in it like they used to. The rice was hard and there was really no seasoning. They give you about 4-5 shrimp and they are huge really wish they would cut them down a little smaller. As for the Pho, it's pretty good but I've definitely had better. I always have to ask for more sprouts and lemon because they just don't ever give enough. I will be back because this the still the closest place for Pho by my new work but I'm only giving 3 stars.  :-)"}
{"text":"Never disappointed. Everything about this place rocks! They are very accommodating to dietary needs and every meal is exceptional. They have a band that plays on the weekends. Great for groups or date nights."}
{"text":"While our waiter, I think his name was Kevin, offered great service and was friendly and helpful, I was just very unimpressed with the food. 

It should be noted that we were a group of 16 people, so things were a bit hectic for them. I ordered the Hainan Chicken and it took the longest to come out, after everyone got their pho and spring rolls. The chicken was dry and wasn't that good. The rice, although flavorful, was also dry. 

My friend ordered Hu Tieu Xao (Flat rice noodles stir fry) and they brought out the wrong order and gave her Mi Hu Tieu (Clear Noodles Soup). After some more confusion and discussion, they brought out her Hu Tieu Xao but it was nothing like what we knew that dish to be. I finally realized that it must be a regional recipe since we were at Pho Da Lat, which is a region in Vietnam. 

I took the Hi Tieu Xao on my tab so she could order something else and took it home. While it was flavorful, the noodles were all broken and not quite appetizing.

However, while I did not taste their pho, it did smell wonderful. The other members of our party that ordered pho did say that the pho is pretty good, but they didn't give enough noodles. 

Considering that their prices were on the higher end of most Pho places, their food wasn't that impressive. Aside from the good customer service we received from our waiter, nothing else stood out to me and I don't think I would come back here."}
{"text":"I stopped in because I had a class in the area and a friend had also given Pho Da Lat the thumbs up. Ordered meatball and tendon pho. Just tasting the broth before adding anything - it was very good (dinner service). Next I tried a meatball - there's something different about the meatball, it was dense but had a full meatiness - what I mean, is some pho meatballs have a lot of gristle in them. This one did not. Added the usual suspects - it was a great bowl. Took home leftovers and was even better reheated.  Sorry no picture - but if you're pho eater, you're mouth should be watering!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place for a while now. I love coming here for a glass of wine and a big bowl of pho. All the dishes I have tried here are flavorful and priced just right. The restrooms are decorated beautifully and are always clean. The staff is always friendly and willing to answer any questions on the menu. I highly recommend this place for a relaxing yummy dinner."}
{"text":"A notch above Pho Nhat but overall wasn't wowed by anything here
(The ambiance here is a lot better though then the divey pho spots around town)

The veggies that accompany the crispy rolls here are pretty good though!
Pho was cheap and filling though my only complaints here was it could have used more meat served rarer~"}
{"text":"The broth is still just ok, but the tendon is awesome!  Huge, tender, and meaty."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bowl of Pho at the Spring Roll Factory only to be greeted by a sign on the door saying we are closed permanently. Since I had a mad craving for Pho I utilized my trusted Yelp app for another spot locally and ran across Pho Da Lat located less than 3 miles away. I am so glad I stopped in here.  This will be my new local, close to home Pho spot. Service was prompt, the fried rolls delish, spring rolls delish and the Pho was OUTSTANDING. The broth was flavorful, the veggies fresh I have no complaints. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"The easy rare pho and garden rolls are delicious. The lunch special is a great deal and filling."}
{"text":"Delicious!  We really enjoyed their pho & spring rolls.  They are actually open later than yelp says on weekends!"}
{"text":"I have to give this 5 stars. 
This is a great little place - the service is always excellent, (friendly, quick and helpful). The owner is often to be seen walking around and chatting to his clients and can explain a lot about the dishes.
The ambiance is very nice with a good \"fung shui\" about it. The fish in the waterfall and pool at the entrance are gettingquite big now.

Tonite we had a starter veggie garden rolls,  1 x veggie noodle soup, 1 x spicey shrimp dish with rice and 2 x tiger beers for approx  $29. The owner threw in a free Tiger beer since we told him we hadn't seen the coupons in the Az Republic.... I took the shrimp dish with a level 5 spice - so it had me sweating a bit. My wife on the other hand likes her dishes very mild - and they are always able to suit her taste.

My wife has a sensitive tum to msg and such things and so has difficuly eating at some chinese or asian  restaurants without getting stomach-aches. However she never has a problem here and she loves the veggie noodle soup. The bowl is rather large so she never gets thru it all.

The veggies they use are all very fresh and the flavors are great. 

We have been to this place at least once a month for the last 6 - 9 months and the service and food quality have remained excellent.

highly recommended"}
{"text":"1st time here & I already love it. The service is quick. The waitress I had was bubbly, kind and personable. She checked on me twice & gave me thumbs up after she asked if I wanted to use chopsticks & I said \"Ofcourse \". The prices are totally well priced & the place is very clean and represents the culture in an elegant way."}
{"text":"The service was incredible! The waitress was attentive to my needs. I ordered the crispy egg rolls and they were packed with meat. I also had the #15, Pho dish with beef and meatballs. It was well seasoned and delicious. I would highly recommend the food and this place. The ambiance is wonderful too. There is Asian decor all around and even three flat screen TVs. The music was American which I disliked. There should have been Vietnamese music."}
{"text":"I come here very often because its the only Pho place within 15 minutes of where i live. It hits the spot now more than before, they mustve changed chefs or recipes. Been coming here for over a year and I have nothing to really complain about. The service is whatever, theres a waiter there that can have an attitude (we've seen him talk back to a customer), but the girls are always nice. 
Takes about 5-7 min to receive the Pho order, you can easily come here on an hour lunch from work. 

Pho43 express will always be the best place in the valley but this place is pretty good too!"}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink):
1 star:  Never again.
2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.
3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.
4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

Let me just start by saying the pho here is fine.  It's pretty good.  But when compared to all the other pho out there in Arizona and California, I can't quite get it to even 4 stars.

First, a bowl of pho here costs about a buck more than most other places.  A buck, in relation to the cost of pho generally, is pretty substantial.  The broth is typically less flavorful than other places, though it is a very clean broth.  The bowl is a little smaller, meaning you get just a little less of everything (and when you get a pho dac biet, a little less of everything is noticeable.)  The spring rolls, also smaller, a little heavy on the noodle filling.  

I've had a couple other random dishes from here which have been fine, but again, nothing outstanding, which is the general vibe of the entire place, thus the 3-star review."}
{"text":"I have to say they've really stepped up their customer service. Their food has always been a 5 star rating but they just needed some help with their service. It's vastly improved and I would have to rerate them to 5 stars.

This is after numerous visits back after some time off. I couldn't resist because the food is that good. 

Also for those vegetarians out there. Vegetable Pho with a veggie broth is something to try. I'm no vegetarian but Wow is it good. 

For those thinking of trying this place out, it's well worth the trip out here. The beauty of it, they make the dish any way you like as well. Different noodles, different meats, mic and match till your hearts (and stomachs) content!"}
{"text":"This place has delicious food. I've been to a fair number of Pho places, though I am no expert, but this place is my favorite by far. Initially I came here on a lunch break with co-workers and since then I've been back with them, with family, and friends. The Pho broth is tasty, the selection of meats is nice and the serving is huge! The rolls they have as an appetizer are great as well. But since first trying it with my b/f my favorite thing on the menu is the delicious Ginger Clams, man they are good! My friend May always gets the vietnamese coffee with the condensed milk and I love their Thai iced tea.

I always leave full and happy, everytime I visit. Plus not long ago they did some major renovating and the place looks really cool and fresh. Totally recommend, 5 stars!"}
{"text":"This place is totally hit or miss!  I've worked in the area for many years and love when new places pop up in the area... I've been going to Pho Da Lat for about the past year and have to say that in the beginning it was great... superior service, quick and tasty food and priced right!  However, my last three experiences... not so good!  After the first two I should have known better!  Generally my coworker and I get the same thing... Veg garden roll and peppered tofu to share... The last time we ate in this is what we ordered.... suffice it to say the server was not very gracious that we were sharing the dish and asked if we wanted the dinner portion instead (never been asked this before and we've ordered the same thing probably a dozen times in the past year!)  We agreed thinking that maybe that's what we had previously been given.  It was not.  Hmmm... same size as we had always gotten but more expensive when the check came!  Oh wait,  not to mention when she brought the dish out it was not what we had ordered and literally had to get up from the table and walk back to the kitchen (after a 10 min wait) to have the dish corrected (brought shrimp when we ordered tofu.)  Needless to say... not a great experience!!!
So last week I had a serious craving for the veg garden rolls! Just those... nothing else! So decided to call in an order and go pick it up... Called the number that I got from google...  Oops not the right number, actually seemed like someone's cell phone but he must work there since he was nice enough to provide me the right number.  Anyway, called the right number, placed my order and was told that it should be ready in 5 min... Great! Left work and went right over there... Got there in probably closer to 10 min... order not ready... not a problem... glad to be out of the office... I can wait... Order ready, and I hand the host my card... he gives me a funny look and asks if I have cash.  Nope, not on this day.  Hmmm... could have told me on the phone that I needed cash... Dontcha think???? Apparently not... Never had a problem using my card here before  but I guess we always met the min.  So figured... OK I'll order the peppered tofu and throw it in the fridge at work and have it for dinner.... Still not enough!  Actually had to add a to go tea on to the bill so he would run the freaking card!  
I won't be going back anytime soon considering that the peppered tofu was completely over spiced and undercooked and in generally just a really bad experience... Even if it means not having Vietnamese for lunch occaisionally... I'll survive!
Skip this place... You never know what your going to get!"}
{"text":"Another ethnic food checked of my list . . . I am no longer a Vietnamese food virgin any more . . . okay . . . at least not a Pho virgin any more . . . and I was truly delighted by the pho.

First, the ambience in this place was above what I was expecting for another strip mall restaurant . . . which raised my expectations to a little higher standard.

Started of with the Spicy Mussels . . . my waitress said I could have them from a hotness scale of 1 to 5 . . . so to be safe . . . I chose 3 . . . the spiciness was just perfect for me and the overall presentation was great . . . however . . . next time I am going to try them at a 4.

For my entrée, I ordered the Pho Da Lat Special Pho . . . it came out hot and the noodles and proteins were tender and delicious . . . again . . . I did not add any extra sauces . . . preferring to enjoy the pho as presented . . . however . . . I might had a little hoisin sauce next time.

My only regret was not trying what looked like a smoothie that I noticed some people completing their meal with . . . oh well . . . there is always next time . . . and yes . . . there will definitely be a next time . . ."}
{"text":"Pho Da Lat is an amazing place!!  I LOVE the Seafood Pho with beef broth (add a lil Hoisin and Sriracha for extra spice)...SO YUMMY!

The service is always fantastic as well.  I go there often for lunch...I suggest YOU do the same - if you can!"}
{"text":"Was very disappointed in this location. Love pho and am accustomed to large servings, tender chicken, lots of toppings. Boyfriend and I decided to only purchase one bowl (due to high prices) and share but had no flavor, chicken was dry, and very few toppings. Service was the worst as no one ever came to refill our waters or check on us once food arrived. Won't waste money here again, better pho within area for better prices and service."}
{"text":"Ordered some Pho Ga and summer rolls to go the other night.  Yummy broth and lots of chicken.  The summer rolls were fresh, and the peanut sauce was yummy.  I am spoiled with Pho having lived in Seattle and Portland the past several years (rainy cities have the best pho), but really.. I was impressed. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Mediocre taste but they are asking for high price for a bowl of noodle soup. I would not return."}
{"text":"We fell in love with Pho in San Francisco, where we found it Gluten Free for my daughter who has Celiac Disease.  The owner made Gluten Free Pho and ensured no cross contamination.  She was aslo able to eat the spring rolls but, not the peanut sauce.  We  all liked our respective Pho.  We had great personal service.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Mi La Kai soup on the side with tripe instead of fried fish meat balls are my favorite. Service is always excellent.

I must have it at least once a week."}
{"text":"Lunch prices and dinner prices vary!

Pho at lunch is $6.99-7.99 and for dinner it's $8.95-9.99

I live very close to here, but do not come here as much as my to go to Vietnamese restaurants. Not really sure why.

Location is clean and organized. Prices are fair. Service is good. Food is delicious!

I should come here more often!"}
{"text":"The broth of their pho is delish! One of the best I've had in the East Valley! The staff is also super nice!"}
{"text":"Clean place , service is okay just the food comes out to slow and sometimes chefs take off early so you can't get certain dishes on the menu !! Was kind of disappointed"}
{"text":"This was our first experience at this Vietnamese place.  As I've mentioned in other postings, we are not from this area, so we rely heavily on reviews, word-of-mouth, etc., so I use this app a lot.  The reviews say that the pho is good here, but we didn't get the pho.  We opted for the Bun instead, which is vermicelli noodles.  We both ordered the number 28 and it was amazing....noodles, and grilled chicken with the sauce on the side....yum!  Can't wait to go again!!"}
{"text":"Was out on this side of town and had a craving for some Vietnamese. Looked on Yelp and this was the closest place. 
Ordered spring rolls and bun xeo and my dad ordered the seafood soup. Soup was pretty tasty. Bun xeo was crispy and filled with goodies. Spring rolls were fresh and good amount of filling. 
Service could have been better but still good. I want to come back and try the beef pho."}
{"text":"I need pork blood in my bun bo hue! Step up Da Lat! Also, your spice scale is wack, I requested a 5 out of 5 on the spicy scale (also strange because I have never been asked this at a pho joint), and you sent me home with some mild ass little kid shit. 

Overall, very good though. The hostess who took my to go order was a little sassy, and I appreciate that. My broth was legit even though it was lacking in spice. Whatevs, you can always spice it up to suite your needs. My order was ready very quickly, but prices were slightly on the high side. I probably won't return even though this is the closest pho to my house. My other spot flips a better product for less money. One Love-"}
{"text":"Good flavors and great portions. We had the country pork chops and the vercimelli, both super tasty. We started with an order of eggrolls, they were delicious and full of flavor. Service was ok but the food made up for it. We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Food is delicious...the service??? not so much but I guess it depends on the waitress. I had the chicken pho and shrimp spring rolls it was delicious! The lunch menu has pretty reasonable prices. I plan on returning..hopeful a waitress who likes her job will attend me next time around:)"}
{"text":"Great pho spot in the Valley! I can't speak to their other items because I've literally only had the pho every time I've been there. I get the veggie pho with beef broth, it's really flavorful and obviously super filling. If you're into appetizers, I like the crispy spring rolls. 

Lunchtime can be busy, but it seems like luck of the draw sometimes. We went in today at noon and had no trouble getting seated and getting our food quickly. 

Servers are friendly and interior is clean and spacious."}
{"text":"We walked in the door and was greeted by no one.  After about a 4-5 minute wait, someone from the kitchen finally appeared and sat us in a booth.  

My wife ordered the seafood pho and I got the meatball pho both complimented by a couple glasses of water.  Now, I can't really say whether or not the pho was good or bad as this was our first time eating it.  It was pretty flavorful but the \"meatballs\" were far from what I'm used to.  Also, my wife was upset they used imitation crab as opposed to real crab, but still enjoyed it.

Service at this place is lacking.  Water glasses went empty and the servers kept walking by us and not refilling.  I had to track someone down who wasnt our server to ask for a refill.

We won't be back."}
{"text":"Pro:
Lovely ambiance, and Service staff. Felt like and upper end restaurant, something which typical Vietnamese restaurants do not offer

Cons:
Well the food was insipid and bland. The pho tasted like salted water with a touch of broth. The condiments like sweet basil etc were dry and flaccid. I would hope that Nam pla was a default accoutrement for most authentic Vietnamese restaurants. I counted 3 meatballs and a few slivers of the rare beef pieces. The quantity was smaller than most other ones I have tasted in the area. Ah well I don't feel too bad as I can trundle on down to Saigon Pho for the better deal and food"}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about Pho, but I feel like the more simple and grungy a pho place is, the better it is. This place is really nice looking. Right away I was worried. I came with some coworkers and had some fresh rolls, spring rolls, and pho ga. The fresh rolls and spring rolls were tasty, especially paired with the peanut sauce. The pho was a bit bland. The price was higher than I usually expect for pho. I wouldn't run back here, but it wasn't bad."}
{"text":"One of the better places for Pho. I wasn't a fan of it at the beginning of the year but the rare brisket pho is good here and the employees are friendly"}
{"text":"I have ordered Bun Bo Hue, Spicy Beef Noodle Soup with Vietnamese pressed ham with thick pasta.  The broth was properly seasoned (I have asked for a 4 stars in spiciness out of 5) and it was delightful.  The flavor has a hint of lemongrass along with other herbs and spices which are essential building block of the soup.  It is NOT authentic but a very successful creation without all the grease.  The Vietnamese Coffee is in par with other places in town.  I have asked the bean sprouts to be cooked on the side and they were very happy to comply with my request..Will return soon and try their other items on the menu soon"}
{"text":"We stopped by here because we were out shopping and this was a convenient place. The food was very mediocre and I'm disappointed by the pricing. The service was fine and restaurant was clean. It was really slow and quiet through the whole lunch hour on a Saturday. I won't be coming back here"}
{"text":"This is the first time I had Pho in my life, so my review may not be perfect, but I wanted to write anyway about the experience. On a rainy Saturday evening, we were craving something hot and wholesome. After driving down to Paradise Cafe and discovering they were closed (who closes at 8 on a Saturday night??!) and then to Whole Foods and finding their food counter full of the day's last leftovers, we headed to Pho Da Lat. 

Not a bad  choice at all! The waiter was really attentive and our orders came really fast. It could be because the restaurant was almost empty. It was good we didn't order appetizers because then I'm sure we would have needed doggy bags. I got the well-done beef shank pho and my friend got the Pho Da Lat special. Our orders came in huge bowls, filled with steaming hot liquid, meat, and veggies, with a side of a few bean sprouts, a lemon wedge and some basil leaves, and of course Hoisin sauce and hot sauce. I'm glad I went easy on the sauce because the pho was so hot (not spicy hot...temperature hot) it made my eyes water. Well, as I said it was my first time having pho, so I don't really have anything to compare it with. But boy, was it delicious! It filled me up,, and it was healthy...so yayyyy pho!"}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese food in it's price class for the Phoenix Valley."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and it's still one of my favorite Vietnamese restaurants in the Phoenix area. I usually order either the Pho Tai Bo Vien (noodle soup with sliced beef and beef meatballs) or the Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio (vermicelli with grilled pork and fried egg roll). Food is consistently good and hits the spot when you are craving some delicious Vietnamese food.

It's true that service is at a slower pace. You can go for a whole meal and probably only see your server 3 times, but I don't mind this as I hate when servers are constantly hovering or interrupting your meal to ask you if everything tastes good. Plus I am never in a hurry when I go here, so I don't mind waiting a little longer to get the check at the end of the meal.

I also think the decor is classy and the lighting is intimate, but not too dark that you can't see the food or the menu. It's a good place to take a date because it's usually not too crowded or loud and you can easily hold a conversation.

I've never noticed the extra credit card charge other revieweres mentioned, but I guess I've never had a check under $10 before. I kind of like that you have the option of paying less if you bring cash though. Saves money for both the customer and restaurant owner!"}
{"text":"Always great pho! I go here all the time and the pho is always on point. The pork vermicelli is always excellent as well. Come to think of it, I've enjoyed everything I've ever ordered from this place!"}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to try this place and what a let down.

I had ordered the bun bo hue and had thought my waitress brought out the wrong dish since there wasn't any pork blood or pork knuckles. Turns out that this place is just an Americanized pho restaurant that doesn't carry pork blood. Ugh. I should have read the menu more closely. My bad.

The dish itself was disappointing. The noodles used had an odd texture and were super soggy. It didn't hold the flavor of the broth at all and seemed like they either overcooked it to death or reboiled leftover noodles from the day before (which is likely since they just opened up on the Sunday when we went). Minus the liberal use of hot oil as their preferred method of heat, the broth didn't have much depth or flavor. What a pity. This was my first meal back in town after an incredible weekend in the bay area! I did like the slices of the Vietnamese ham though.

Service is okay and the place is clean. They do seem to cater to a more Americanized clientele though. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I was craving pho this weekend, so I turned to my trusty Yelp to help guide me to my salvation.  Enter: Pho Da Lat.  First, the interior is very nicely decorated.  A little water feature at the entrance with live koi swimming around, and very tastefully placed Asian decorations throughout.  

My daughter ordered the spring rolls and I ordered the summer rolls to start, which provides me with my only criticisms from my visit.  It took more than 10 minutes to bring out our rolls -- and in fact, my daughter's fried spring rolls came out BEFORE my raw summer rolls!  I'm not sure if they had to drive to the nearest body of water to catch the shrimp in my rolls or what, but it took waaaaaay too long to bring out some simple rolls.  The summer rolls themselves were just okay, not as good as Maxim or Sekong by Night.  

For our meals, I ordered the seafood pho (minus the fish balls) and my daughter ordered the curry chicken.  The broth of my pho was absolutely delicious!  It was flavorful and tasty, and I will definitely be going back for more!  It included crab, calamari and shrimp.  My daughter also enjoyed her curry chicken, although I wasn't that impressed with it when I tasted it, but, to each his own!

All in all, a good experience, and I'll be going back for more seafood pho.  But they just need to speed up service a bit."}
{"text":"My bf and I landed in Phoenix from DC and decided to stop by here for dinner before heading back to Tucson.  I ordered the bun bo hue (spicy beef noodle soup). They have 1-5 of spicy level, which 1 is the lowest spicy and 5 is the most spicy. I went with the 5 because I love spicy food and especially  when it comes to bun bo hue. 

The broth and noodles cooked perfectly but it missing some stuff such as pork blood and pork feet, but overall I think it's the best bun bo hue  I ever ate in arizona. The spicy level was perfect for me and also it's not over powering. I love the Vietnamese ham that they put in there and the veggies were all fresh. 

The service was nice. Our waiter came to our table to check on us from time to time to see if we need anything else. The restaurant was clean and well organized. I would definitely recommend here if they want to find a decent Vietnamese restaurant. I am looking forward to come back to try other dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"Good pho, good soup, and good service! I'd been craving pho for a few days now and this place definitely hit the spot! The server was really nice and even brought me a dish of chili I asked for. It's a pretty relaxed atmosphere and they even have real koi fish in their pond! I will definitely come back and bring my friends =)"}
{"text":"Food was flavorful...service was good...host polite and delightful to see..order came out extremely quick..it's my first time trying pho from somewhere but hey...I am completely satisfied..and I get ticked easily when food I pay for isn't good..good job staff...you will see me plenty"}
{"text":"I never tire of a deliciously hot bowl of Pho from this place. This service is efficient and the food tastes so very fresh. The veggie pho is my favorite along with the soft appetizer spring rolls. My son usually gets the beef pho or one of the fried rice dishes and we have never been disappointed. Good lunch crowd every single day of the week. Yummy."}
{"text":"I stopped by for lunch during my work day and was pleased with the atmosphere and service. The grilled chicken rice plate was delicious and a well priced alternative to nearby fast food options. The Vietnamese Iced Coffee is a must try!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is very well decorated with lots of booths and tables for seatings. Service is decent and there are plenty of parking in the lot. 

Wow! Their spring rolls are truly delicious. We ordered the fried spring roll as well as the rice paper spring roll (#1 and #2 on their menu - sorry I forgot the names), they are both super delicious!!!! The egg roll with cold noodles. Unfortunately it was a bit tasteless even after I add half a bowl of fish sauce in it. For drink, I ordered a fresh coconut. It was very small but sweet with lots of juice in it. 

I couldn't think of a better place for lunch and will definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Disappointed!

It used to be a 5 star place fore me...it's slowly going down hill. The portion sizes are down. I love to order their pepper tofu...I am getting a lot more rice that I used to...but the portion of the curry went down. So, I feel like I am eating just steamed rice. 

Secondly... I heard a few complaints from my friends and ignored them... but I too had a rotten red bell pepper in my pepper tofu. Now I see the trend. Used to be a great place."}
