{"text":"Four of us went to Grappa Ristorante near Queensway and Royal York Rd. on a weeknight.  I had been hunting for a great higher-end Italian restaurant since the early 2000s, ever since i'd fallen in love with the seafood at Presto on Broadway in New York City's Upper West Side (not Pasta Presto), and since Presto had closed.  I tried high-end Italian places in Los Angeles and Toronto, but Grappa is the first one that met my expectations.  We ordered the Penne Puttanesca with tiger shrimp.  The night's special was trout, and I ordered the Salmon Canadese, a pan-seared salmon with maple-mustard dijon cream.  The penne was fine, but very unremarkable -- the tiger shrimp taste firm and fresh, but lack any sense of special flavour that might distinguish it from, say, homemade tiger-shrimp pasta.  It was the fish dishes that made an impression.  The people in my party had a taste of one another's dishes and I found the trout good but not great, but the two ladies who had actually ordered the trout said it was top-notch.  The salmon that I had was, for me, the best entree.  It is the first fish dish I've had at a restaurant that matched up to Presto's \"Salmon Chef Style\", with a complex sauce that complements the taste of the fish without overwhelming it, and the texture of the fish is impeccable -- it melts in your mouth, practically, but still retains its shape on your fork and on the plate.  After the main dish we had desserts, a crème brûlée that was delicious.  After 10-plus years of searching, this was the Italian fish dish that I had been looking for, so for that salmon dish alone, I would be returning to Grappa.  Service was very nice, with a spunky young lady with an East Coast accent who was charming but not rehearsed.  She recited the complicated specials of the night from memory and knew the menu very well, and her service was fast and efficient while making the atmosphere welcoming but not generic.  She just seemed real and appealing.  Extra points to the establishment for not sanding down their employees' personal quirks.  I am very picky when it comes to service, in terms of speed, courtesy as well as authenticity, and this was one of the rare places that surpassed my expectations.  If I had criticisms of the restaurant, it's that it's a bit dark inside, the dining areas feel like they are below street level and have a slight \"basement\" feel, and the outside of the restaurant makes it look not too much like, well, a restaurant.  I would think that with a more open, brighter front, this restaurant would attract more customers, which it deserves."}
{"text":"I've been to Grappa on a few occasions (haven't visited this new location yet), and had to share their greatness with yelp. Honestly Italian restaurants generally don't impress me- most pastas are just mediocre and it's always the same old schtick. However the first time I dined here, they won me over. The service is always great and charming, the atmosphere is cozy, and the food is always top notch. I always get their mushroom & truffle linguine and I've got to say I wish I could recreate this at home to save me some money. It's perfect, has the right amount of earthyness, just enough acidity, and the hearty mushrooms make it a filling meal.   All in all, this is one of the only Italian restaurants I'll frequent and I cant recommend them enough."}
{"text":"Excellent menu - decent wine list - friendly and helpful staff - great local spot."}
{"text":"Yes, this is the same Grappa restaurant that used to be at 797 College Street. Same owner, updated dinning area. This restaurant is a great place to enjoy a delicious Italian meal and a night out dinning. One of the most extensive wine lists that I've ever seen with something for everyone. The food is creatively presented, fresh, and delicious. Be prepared to stay awhile, and relax. If the blueberry creme brule is on the dessert menu, don't pass it up. The owner is working the Front Of House, and is very engaged and involved with customers ensuring they are enjoying their experience. Pricey, but well worth it."}
{"text":"Finally getting around to reviewing this place, it is honestly fantastic! I go there with my family often and I recommend their carpaccio and octopus. They used to be on college I believe but have moved and I have been with them ever since! The service is always above and beyond as well."}
{"text":"First time at Grappa - live in the area and I have to say, we had an amazing experience.  I love pasta with seafood and this had to be one of the best.  So fresh, light and delicious.  The veal on the bone was incredible.  Wine list is fantastic - Super Tuscan a great buy.  Waiter and Manager made us feel very welcomed.  Decor very 'fancy/upscale', more rustic laid back decor would make it feel less prententious. Food is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Toujours aussi bon, dommage que ce ne soit plus dans le quartier italien mais dans les  quartiers du Queensway. Cuisine italienne de qualité, service excellent, choix impressionnant de vins : tout pour plaire !"}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times, mainly with my significant other's family or just the two of us. We are a mixed family of Italian, Chinese and British, just so you know regarding the racist experience that some may have had.  The service has almost always been excellent, but this restaurant tends to hold large parties - when that happens, they are generally understaffed both FOH and BOH. I've visited during a large event, and my food had come out an hour later after being sat - we spoke to the manager about the lack of service as we know that is not the case when they aren't incredibly busy. He apologized and offered to waive our bill, but we insisted to pay for our appetizers. He packed our entrees and said it was on the house to have a midnight snack. It was nice of him and he did not have to do that.  The food here is excellent, the price you pay, the portion and quality you get is your money's worth."}
{"text":"I'm sure the busy night played a part in our horrible dining experience but we had reservations and were sat in a decent amount of time along with a party of four and another party of two. We sat down and waited for water or bread or a hello but it didn't come until 30 minutes later. In that 30 minutes both parties we were sat with had their drinks delivered bread and their orders taken. The waiter finally approached and asked if we wanted drinks and as me and my girlfriend are it wine drinkers we opted for water and said we were ready to order. The waiter said okay and left to take the order of another table. We didn't have the patience to wait around to try the food after being ignored for so long."}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight just cause we were in the area and didn't know where to eat since we live in DT Toronto.   What a great surprise.  Perfect Italian food.   Super nice place.  Homey but not casual,  fancy but not fake....  Great wine list and simple Italian menu with the best u can think of.   Had the caprese  salad to start, the mozzarella was so fresh and tasty.  The pasta was cooked Perfect and the sea food was great.   Will totally drive back from Toronto for that place.   Our server,  Giovani was very helpful and informative."}
{"text":"One of the nicer Italian restaurants in Etobicoke. We really enjoyed the pasta, and we are used to downtown food so that says a lot!"}
{"text":"Went here for a business lunch a while back. The food was good and was about average for what you might expect from an independent, authentic Italian restaurant might deliver. Prices were \"average\" which is to say I consider them slightly high as compared to momma preparing the same thing at home (so to speak) but certainly not out of line as you might encounter elsewhere."}
{"text":"Went for dinner few days ago Liked the place even though I liked Lucy's better which is next door  I liked the bread, it was very fresh  Had veal Limone with fettuccini, it was too creamy and the vegetables for nicely cooked. Veal was lacking the lemon note  Will not order again  The dessert was average. The service was excellent"}
{"text":"Just an ok Italian  restaurant on Queensway. The service was great. Very attentive servers. We went on Winterlicious. The portions are good size. Food is just okay. Nothing really inventive. I still prefer Grano on Yonge & Eglinton."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service..seafood was fresh and reasonably priced. Waiter was very attentive and kept refilling our glasses with water even after we paid."}
{"text":"Unprofessional, owner was rude - I believe because I was a person of colour.. he cancelled my reservations and said I could wait an hour or more if I wanted service. He did not compromise and did not speak to me so nicely. Won't be back. Won't recommend this spot."}
{"text":"Not good Pasta - pappardelle beef was third rate Calamari rubber Amateurish  Steak= wannabe  Friendly but limited knowledge service Mediocre wine list 200$ for three ; no bargain for the above Avoid"}
{"text":"I have been to both this and the original Grappa maybe a half dozen times over the years and found it usually decent and occasionally very good. This was by far our worst experience.   The Resto was packed which could have (although it should not have) lead to the staff being a particularly unhappy group. It is hard for me to understand how someone in sales can't smile at least once or twice? But they succeeded.  And what's up with not listening to the customer when they make an entree selection? While she sold me hard on the Osso Bucco and went along with it, not a peep was heard when she later cleared my half finished plate.  Other soup and salad apps where disappointing as well.   Hmm..others seem to been happy with the New Grappa but I have to say it is going to be difficult to return."}
{"text":"This is my second time here and the food has always been great. We're here for my cousins first communion celebration. With that said the menu was already picked out. We had tomato with goat cheese, Caesar salad, grilled calamari, cold cuts and chicken with mash. All the dishes served were full of flavour. The right amount of dressing for the salad, calamari grilled well and not rubbery, mash was great. The chicken could've used more flavour but still wasn't bad. I would have gone here more often if it wasn't an hour away."}
{"text":"Lots of food, friendly family oriented restaurant which servers regular customers well. Cannot say it was the tastiest italian food ever but it was good, well located for Etobicoke and well priced. As a foodie, I approve Grappa as a place you can take your elders."}
{"text":"We booked an appointment with the restaurant manager to book a large group dinner for our daughter's baptism. He was really good on the phone, but when he saw us he was extremely dismissive and distance. What could it be???? I will never go to that restaurant or support their business .   The dark ages are over and there are many different  people and races in the world and businesses need to be inclusive, we live in Canada damn it!!!!"}
