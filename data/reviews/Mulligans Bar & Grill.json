{"text":"I will never go back here. My bartender was sara (dinner/night shift). First i ordered a beer and paid with a 10$ and she disappeared for 20 mintues. No change nothing.  I thought it was an honest mistake and was only 3.50 so i didn't want to make a big deal. Next drink i ordered a beer (bottle of miller lite) and a shot. I paid the 13$ charge with a 20$ smallest thing i had. Not 10 minutes later a new bartender came out. I asked where the last one went and he told she was off and left. 

I have never before had a bartender tip herself by just talking the money and not coming back. All in all she tipped herself 10.50$ of my money/should have been change, and all for 2 millers and a shot. Thanks sara for being the worst and most DISHONEST bartender i have ever had. That is STEALING from your customer's plain and simple!!!!! Watch her like a hawk because i highly doubt this was the first time she stole from someone."}
{"text":"They have a new Restaurant inside that has an extended menu.  The food is great. Out of the the restaurants they have had here this is the best.  As for the bartenders all are fast and very friendly. You never have to wait for a drink. If you go in the day time see Dawn. She will brighten anyone's day.

{"text":"Sara: great service! Food: so much better than run of the mill bar fare. Get the veggie quesadilla. So. Good."}
{"text":"If you are just going for drinks and gambling, hit this place up. I frequent this joint on Saturday during the daytime. Carrie serves drinks, and she does it well. The kitchen is rather bland  bar food and atmosphere is like any other Vegas hole-in-the-wall bar: video poker, dark, TVs, smoke, some sports carp on the wall, and the local drunk glued to the bar. But the strong cocktails and attentive service keeps me coming back - and is what my review is based on."}
{"text":"For a NLV 24/7 bar, this place ain't bad. It's never too crowded. The local patrons are friendly. The bartenders (especially in the mornings and afternoons) are really sweet, friendly, and attentive. The beer offerings are meh, but they'll hit the spot well enough. The food menu is plentiful with numerous options. Tip: The kitchen here does close, so if you're looking to eat, be sure to come here early enough. It's small and dark. It's a little dive-y, but without all the germs. For a neighborhood 24/7 bar, this place is pretty great."}
{"text":"Mulligans is an awesome neighborhood bar. Very friendly staff and good food. I have been to Mulligans for every shift and I have only had the best service. My favorite bartenders are Sara,  Steve, Eddie and Sue. They are amazing! I highly recommend this bar."}
{"text":"Been coming to this local bar for a few years now.  Love stopping in when Sara is working!  Makes us feel right at home.  They have cold drinks and hot machines!  Haven't had a chance to try the food but all the customers seem to enjoy dinner when we are in there.  Go and check them out, hopefully Sara will be working."}
{"text":"I would have given them 0 stars if possible
I went today and there was 3 people in the place
The Bartender/Wattress was on the phone and after 15 minutes never even looked my way so I just left
Will not go back as first impressions are most important"}
{"text":"Being British and based in Las Vegas, I had hoped for more.  The place was pretty empty and my food was expensive and not that great.  Service was slow too and I would rather eat at Mulligans or Crown and Anchor if I want Pub food.   The range of beers was very good though."}
{"text":"I live across town but still have to come to this bar twice a week. Sara is the best and makes the best shots! I will follow her to my bar she goes to! Mulligans has great drink specials and is a great cheers type atmosphere."}
{"text":"Kick ass local bar. Maribel's is the restaurant located within. Awesome food. We come here every night when we're in town for work and they treat us like regulars. Sara and Eddie are awesome! All the food on the menu is phenomenal, home cooked Mexican dishes. Their carne asada and chile verde in particular are fantastic. Beer is cold and always waiting for us! I wish I could find a bar like this in my home town."}
{"text":"So this evening, I was in town and my company has a corporate account across the street at The Cannery. I stay there 2-3 times per year while working in Vegas and had gone into Mulligan's once before like 3-4 years ago ... wasn't too impressed. But tonight I was over the casino and decided to head over for a few beers and some video poker. 
As I walked in, I was greeted by the bartender Sara with a big \"hi! How you doing?\" Quickly got me a beer and asked if I were hungry. I wasn't thinking of eating there, but said sure ... I'd check out the menu. To my surprise it was Mexican food (happens to be my favorite). I asked her how the Chili Verde was, she said really good. I went for it. 
Not only was it good, it was amazing. And I love Chili Verde. 
I sat there playing video poker listening to the locals interact with her, some guys from the local Air Force base as well. She had a great sense of humor and made us all feel welcome, local or not. 
I will definitely be returning. Thank you for a great break from a usually boring work trip in a hotel casino. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"This is a nice local bar. The bartenders have always been prompt in refilling my drinks and they are fair with the amount of alcohol they pour. Give this place a try."}
{"text":"Eddie is the best he remembered our names and he continuously provides a wonderful experience. He also makes the best bloody Maria in north Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Nice bartender! She kept our drinks flowing even though it was only 8am on a Sunday morning! 

The food was disgusting. Super, super gross."}
{"text":"For a business trip we stayed at the Hampton Inn just to off the freeway and after a long day of teaching we wanted some damn good food, chill environment and good drinks. This instantly equates to a \"dive\" bar and we found this little gem called Mulligans. Our bar tender was one of the coolest chicks I have ever had the opportunity to meet. There specials for the evening included a Mac & Cheese bacon burger, and a peanut butter and jelly burger. I chose the Mac and cheese burger. First, the patty was hand made and it was a substantial pice of ground beef cooked to perfection. The bacon was of quality and the Mac and cheese homemade. It was in the top 3 of hamburgers I have had. Being old school I went with the tots, they were a nice golden brown, not draped in grease not burnt. My buddy also stated his pb&j burger was equally phenomenal. A major down side for me was the lack of a good quality ipa on tap. This would have sent my review easily over 5 stars. But it didn't stop us from going back the next night."}
{"text":"First off THIS IS NOT MULLIGANS ANYMORE! 
I am a true yelper when it comes to food and all my friends know that. A few weeks ago my softball team was in town for a tournament. After a full day of playing I took it upon myself to look up a sports bar and grill....We all were starving and wanted to watch some football. Took us 30 minutes to get there but we all were pumped!
Once there...everything looked normal until we walked in. No one was there to eat...just a few 'regulars' at the bar. Only one bartender/server and I believe he was the owner.
Took us forever to get a beer. Then....even longer to get our order taken...AND there weren't even enough menus for all of us so a few of us had to share. (Keep in mind that we were the only ones there to eat!....about 10 of us).
But..let me just take a step back....THE MENUS WERE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WAS ONLINE! The name on the top of the menu was different. They had more Mexican on the menu than traditional bar and grill menus. This was no longer a burger joint anymore. I asked the owner and sure enough the name AND the menu of the place just changed. It didn't look very appetizing but we were all hungry and drove all that way to get there. 
We ordered. The owner guy there was the only service we got. I think there must have been 1 other person in the kitchen cooking but that was it. Took sooooo long to get our food.  IT...WAS....BAD! 
We were in there for 2 hours....waiting mostly. 
Full bar (good luck getting service)...and tv's though TG!
Christmas lights were still up (this was two weeks into January).
I really was disappointed."}
{"text":"Great local type hangout bar.  Sit down, order drinks, have a great time.
If you are among the lucky, you will visit when Sara is bartending.   She effing rocks!  Also had some excellent suggestions when I wanted something out of the norm."}
