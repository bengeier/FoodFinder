{"text":"This is our go to Chinese takeout place in Woodbridge. Food is always fresh, and service is always friendly."}
{"text":"Picked up a meal for one and it was good. I found all the food was hot and tasted really nice. The only thing is their Cantonese chow mien was really different. All other Chinese restaurants I've been to that tastes the same but here they make it quite different. Not bad but very different. Still it is good"}
{"text":"Food is good and fresh, quality is ok.  
Only issue for me is the wife here is a bit rude over the phone and in person. The husband is super nice but she needs some customer service training or put her in the back with no customer interaction."}
{"text":"Love this place. All the food is fresh and hot  chicken balls are great. Owners are great too."}
{"text":"Average westernized Chinese take out but always takes twice as long to serve as they say it will.  On more then one occasion I have seen people ask for their money back because their order took too long.  

Location in Barrie is much better."}
{"text":"An Asian restaurant/take out in a predominately Caucasian neighbourhood can go either two ways; successful or very poor. In this case, it's the latter. I can't judge completely yet, as I've only eaten there once, but after the first experience I wouldn't go back. Had dumplings and lo mein noodles. The dumplings were actually decent. But the noodles were very bland, the sauce was very salty and the pork was beyond chewy. Just didn't seem fresh to me. To make it worse, all that was about $25. If I'm
Spending that much for a meal, it better be delicious."}
{"text":"This has become our go-to place for Chinese. We love their unique tiny chicken balls (not too much batter), General Tsao Chicken and rice. Spring rolls are odd with shredded shrimp and chicken inside--not \"spring-like\" at all. Family dinners are a good deal. I'd prefer they give a percentage off the bill, instead of something piddly like 3 free egg rolls, if paying cash. 

Extremely annoyed that I showed up at 11 am (opening time) one Friday to bring my kids a hot lunch, and waited around for a good 20 minutes, only to realize there was no one around inside and they were definitely not opening for lunch that day!

Somehow, though, we try other Chinese restaurants and Asian One seems to always come out on top."}
