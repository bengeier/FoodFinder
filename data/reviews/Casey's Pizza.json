{"text":"Best in Turle Creek. I love the staff. Has been burnt on bottom but only few times but better than greasy Shelly pies over 25 bucks for med 1 topping and floats on your stomach for days. They have good deals occasionally, havent tasted a better non big chain pizza better. Delivery guy Tom nice"}
{"text":"Great pizza for a great price! Really tasty sauce, perfect amount of toppings, and nice crust thickness. Middle of pizza was a little sauce/cheese soggy, but the taste more than made up for it."}
{"text":"Our office's \"go to\" local place. Always good and consistent quality product. Speedy delivery, no delivery charges or hidden add ons."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Friendly staff. I requested thin crust with pepperoni. They nailed it. Very affordable... I'll try there hogies next visit."}
{"text":"The bread sticks are buttery and good and the sauce has a nice, homemade taste. I did definitely get served gyro meat when I ordered a steak hoagie one time. But before that happened the steak hoagies were decent too."}
{"text":"Perhaps if you're a \"local?\"  This spot seems to have great potential as a lovely out-of-the-way place to perhaps grab a bite to eat.  However, inexplicably, they seem to enjoy making it clear that it's locals/regulars only welcomed here.  The ordering experience should best be left to those without any questions.  This is made remarkably more difficult because they have a minimal web presence.  However, we chose to overlook these faults of theirs.  That was, admittedly, our mistake.  Our party decided to pop in, despite 'knowing better' than to even try to \"customize\" any menu items based on previous, horrible experiences along this trip in the Pittsburgh, PA area.  This time, we simply asked what was included on the given menu offering.  None of us have \"restrictions,\" per se, we were merely curious.  Violation!  The waitstaff actually let out an exasperated sigh upon our very first question.  We've travelled through countless countries without issue, but this simple question was enough to present an issue.  Is this customary in the United States of America?  Is it merely localized to Pittsburgh, PA?  Why were we subjected to such treatment for merely asking a question?  While, yes, your establishment chose to fully earn this solid, poor two-star rating, this singular experience will not mar our overall trip.  Hopefully, this will prove to be a learning moment to your staff.  Each and every chance to offer exemplary service should be made to count."}
{"text":"We have had the pizza at Casey's once or twice. We as a family liked the pasta dishes. There are a lot more pizza shops in the area now, and lots to choice from. If your looking for a change for a night. Casey's isn't a bad choice. It is not a steady support shop, not bad if you need something different. The pizza for the value isn't bad. Service has always been friendly and quick."}
{"text":"This place is like a small, back room, illegal food stand that treats you like they don't care about you or your business. They think their pizza is great and that you should be honored just to get one. FU casey's, I'm going across the street to get a real pizza."}
{"text":"Its defies reason how one establishment could employ so many rude people. I wont be returning."}
{"text":"Lady was talking on the store phone then went to the back to assist the person making my salad with her bare hands. I asked if she could make me a new one with gloves. She acted as if she didn't see what the problem was... if she did that in front of me, I can only imagine what sanitary precautions they take for deliveries"}
{"text":"We always pick-up our order.  It's always fresh and hot and ready when they say it will be ready.  Casey's makes some GREAT PIZZA.    Hubs is a big fan of the hot sausage hoagie, too."}
{"text":"On a budget? In a rush? Look no further!!! Casey's has some truly delicious and tasty meals that hit the spot, and don't rob the bank. From the pizza (my fave!), gyros, rigatoni, and toasted subs, what more could you ask for? If you're ever in the area, make sure you give them a shot!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and fantastic hot subs.  We are a Turtle Creek business and order here all the time.  Delivery is prompt and these folks are always friendly and easy to deal with."}
