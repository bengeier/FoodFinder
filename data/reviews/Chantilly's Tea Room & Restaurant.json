{"text":"Not a safe place for allergies!! I can respect a place where they say \"oh, we use lots of [whatever you're allergic to], so your food is going to be contaminated if you eat here,\" so that I can go somewhere else. But I find it very dishonest, reckless, and downright lacking in human decency when I tell someone that I have a dairy allergy and ask if there is something I can eat without dairy and the person looks me in the eye and tells me yes and proceeds to make suggestions, as though he will ensure that I won't get dairy in my food. People often conflate allergies with intolerances, but servers and restaurant staff should know the difference and be honest about their capabilities. Our server seemed inconvenienced by our presence and didn't care to check on us more than once during our meal. I had a feeling that he wasn't someone I should trust by eating the food there given my allergy, but I tried it with a friend. I got very, very painfully ill after eating here. I suspect they use butter on whatever they use to press their sandwiches and don't bother to clean things off for someone with an allergy, because my bread had a scent of butter that made me concerned. I won't be going back since it took me three days to be back to normal.  The sandwich I ate was underwhelming and waaaaay overpriced. Somehow I managed to spend nearly $20 for a sandwich and chips and a cup of hot tea. I couldn't eat the little tea cakes they bring before the food because they were dairy-laden and they didn't have a non-dairy alternative. Not worth that price at all."}
{"text":"While the food is good our experience was horrible. I was having a bridal shower here and when we got there we were told we did not have a reservation yet my future in-laws card was charged the rental fee. The owner was not apologetic at all and down right rude about the situation. Our waitress was very nice and tried to make up for the missed reservation. They did not offer to refund the charge or anything and we had to say we will bring the credit card bill to show you the charge and have you refund. The room sat empty (while they waited on a reservation that never came, because it was ours) and when we went to pay somehow they had the credit card number written down and it was my in-laws, interesting! Rude owner!  Never apologized!"}
{"text":"This is a cute little place to go with your friends for a relaxing environment, the have great service and great food, delicious teas and just generally quaint. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes this environment."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I was looking for a very special experience to have with my out-of-state sister and our granddaughters. This was little more than a glorified sandwich shop with teacups and plates on the wall and tarnished silver placed around. The waiters had to be multi functional and served in jeans and T shirts. The sandwich for one of the girls was old bread and apparently sliced canned ham. The lemons were old and brown. The other food was acceptable, but nothing I could not have easily prepared at home. I will not be patronizing."}
