{"text":"Nice 'date night' with my wife. The macadamia nut cheesecake was delicious!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. We were looking for a nice place to go in Wexford. We got dressed up and were excited to sit outside were the live entertainment was setting up. After the hostess seated us, we were never greeted by a waiter or waitress. We waited 10 minutes. I went to the bathroom and came back. Still not even a \"Hi, Welcome, or what can I get you to drink?\" We left... and will never go back. We always liek to give people a chance. Everyone has their off days.  But this was bad. Our first time every leaving a restaurant.

There were others seated outside. There were many open tables. It was 6:30. They should have been able to handle a few tables at dinner time."}
{"text":"I think that Fresco's is the worst restaurant in Wexford.  A wine bar that is out of wines?  Not willing to offer like priced bottles at a by the glass price when none of their wines by the glass are available?  Being that this restaurant is attached to the Chadwick I have to say that I shouldn't have been surprised when the food was of banquet quality or lower.  A friends pasta was SWIMMING in oil.  I had a burger, not sure how you can screw that up, but it was pretty lousy.  Also our server was almost non existent for the entire night.  Go elsewhere!!!!!!"}
{"text":"French onion and cream of broccoli soups both good. Table bread good. Server attentive but loud bordering hysterical. Entrees both terrible. Prime rib sandwich probably left from the week before. Filet slapped on a flat top with no seasoning. Ambiance that of a dining hall in a retirement home. We should have known better when the parking lot was empty at 6:30 on Friday."}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten at Frescos a number of times the last few years, and decided a review was in order. 
  First and foremost, of all of the times we have eaten there, we have NEVER gotten a bad meal. Not even a borderline meal. They have been consistently superb. 
  Our most recent visit was 10/26/13. They were approximately 3/4 full when we arrived(7:30), so we were seated quickly. Our server was friendly and prompt with menus, drinks and food. We never had to search her out, she was efficient without being smothering. She brought some bread and herbed dipping oil, which was quite tasty.

  I got the pot roast, and it was fantastic. Melt in your mouth fork tender beef, with chedder mac and cheese and caramelized Brussels sprouts (which i was prepared to hate, but loved). My wife got a shrimp and ravioli seasonal special dish that was also exceptional. We have had several of the dinners that are currently on the menu, and they were all delicious. 
  
   The prices are moderate, both food and alcohol. Dinner and drinks will end up with a $50-$60 check. Add apps and dessert and you will be around $75. Not a bad value for food of this quality, along with a quiet and laid back atmosphere, where you can have a conversation with your dinner partner without yelling. (Yes, i am talking about YOU Siba!!) They do have an outdoor patio with entertainment during the summer months. We have never tried that though.
  
   The only negative we had from our most recent visit was that we both requested containers for the uneaten portion of our dinners, and somehow our server mixed my wife's up with someone elses(we discovered this after we got home). Human error, no big deal."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant with a great food and wine selection. The spicy seafood pasta is delicious and actually spicy. The crab dip and goat cheese salad both were well made, and the dip was not greasy. Service is very good -- our waiter was very friendly and cheerful. Atmosphere is casual. 

The restaurant actually closes at 10pm on Friday and Saturday. 

We will definitely be back when we are in the North Hills area."}
