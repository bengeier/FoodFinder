{"text":"I stopped in on a Saturday morning, pumped about some B & G (biscuits and gravy). 
Well, I had got it to go thinking it would be quick! Guess what? It wasn't. I figured I'd be in and out! Biscuits should have been baked and the gravy should have needed a good stir. It took approximately 6 minutes to get my half order. WAY to long of a wait for B & G!
I got them home and add some eggs to the top of them and some hot sauce! Good thing b/c the gravy was bland and flavorless. The sausage tasted over cooked and was tough. 
I may give it another shot. Probably not breakfast though!"}
{"text":"My SO and I decided to try this place out on a rainy Friday night.  I grew up in Southern Mississippi and was looking forward to trying some \"authentic\" southern cooking that I didn't have to do myself.  

The Pros:  The restaurant was clean and had nice, although  generic, New Orleans decorations (some mardi gras beads and posters.)  I really enjoyed the Zydeco music and our waitress was very friendly.  

The Cons:  This is not creole, Cajun, or even remotely Southern style cooking. The food was all bland with no seasoning and even the sweet tea was not Southern style sweet.   

We  had the Fried Green Tomatoes and Catfish Bites for an appetizer. The appetizers took about 30 minutes to come out and a table of six that was sat down after us received their appetizers well before our table of two did.   Both came with Remoulde sauce that tasted more like homemade tartar sauce.  Both appetizers were greasy and it seems like their oil was not near hot enough to cook them crispy.  The appetizers  had absolutely no seasoning, not even salt.  They do have seasoning on the table and with a liberal dose of it, the food was still not palatable.    

 I ordered the shrimp creole.  My SO ordered the crawfish boil and was told that it came with crawfish, Andouille sausage, shrimp, potatoes and corn. After about 45 minutes the main entrees came out.   The shrimp creole was actually pretty good even though again, I had to liberally season it with tableside seasoning. .  My SO's dinner however tasted of absolutely nothing.  It literally tasted as if the seafood had been boiled in plain water.  The potatoes were quartered baking potatoes and the sausage was not  Andouille but tasted like over cooked kielbasa.   For $24.99 we expected a crawfish boil that had some flavoring and little bit of heat. The waitress did not explain upon ordering that it was cooked with no seasoning.   Two waitresses came over to explain that they don't season it as some people do not like the spice. This is supposed to be a creole-Southern restaurant, not  hospital food.  I could understand if they used a mild spice but absolutely none?   Our waitress was very nice and took the crawfish boil off of our bill. 

Overall, the food was disappointing and I could have eaten better seasoned food at a nursing home.  I think that if they were to actually season their food and take the time to adjust their frying temperatures, they might have a good chance however I am not willing to spend my money on a restaurant that bills itself as a Cajun-Creole place when its not."}
{"text":"We loved the homemade chips that are served when you're seated. Stacy is an awesome server! Our drinks were never empty. The seacakes are my favorite! And the beignets... oh. my. goodness! I wanted to stop eating them but couldn't seem to make myself. My friend had the fried shrimp. They're hand-breaded with a very light seasoning - nothing comes from a bag here. We'll definitely be back! I'm sorry to have read of other reviewers' unpleasant experiences but I typically give a new restaurant (especially a locally owned one) a month or two to work out the kinks."}
{"text":"As a native Southerner, I was excited to see a place like this open.  My boyfriend and I checked it out one afternoon for lunch.  After we were seated, our waitress informed us they were pretty much out of every side besides their homemade potato chips.  Ooookay.  So we ordered....I ordered the shrimp poboy and my boyfriend had the crab cake/seafood sandwich.  It was horrible!  The shrimp poboy only had about 6 shrimp on it and they were flavorless.  The crab cake was soggy.  Definitely won't be going here again."}
{"text":"We went to Louie's Dixie Kitchen on a Tuesday night around 5:30 pm for dinner. We are foodies, and we love Southern cooking and Louisiana food in particular, the spicier the better. We've long been fans of Cajun cooking shows (Justin Wilson was a favorite), and we've cooked from them and more over the years. We're good cooks, but don't often have the time during the week to devote to something slow cooked and layered in flavor. So we were hopeful.

First, the pros: We found the place clean and well staffed, with a pretty, bright, themed decor. Cajun music was playing, but not too loudly. The staff were very nice, very professional. 

Next, the cons: The food is not good. 

The best thing we ate was the appetizer. We ordered the hush puppies, which came with a remoulade. We received 5 hush puppies and a remoulade for dipping. The remoulade tasted like traditional Midwestern potato salad dressing. The hush puppies were good, although slightly underdone in the middle.

We next had salads with house-made dressing. The salads were iceberg lettuce with sliced tomato on a plate. The lettuce was not fully drained, the tomato lacked flavor. The house-made dressing tasted like the plain, unseasoned base. The blue cheese and green goddess were indistinguishable from one another in taste or appearance.

For entrees, we both had the triple sampler: red beans and rice, jumbalaya, and gumbo. The three portions came in approximately 8 oz. diner soup cups on a plate, with a small but decent hoecake. All three were watery, unseasoned, and lacked developed flavor or any attempt at spice / heat. The red beans and rice had no pork flavor in the broth, and there was no hint of garlic or cayenne (let alone the trinity). The whole had not been cooked down until the beans were creamy. The beans and rice together had a slippery texture. The jumbalaya was equally watery, with no chicken or sausage (you can pick one or the other, which begs the question of whether the meat is cooked in the pot to develop flavor or added at the end -- a sin -- or in our case left out altogether). The gumbo was just a hint better than utterly bland. The brown roue had slightly thickened the flavorless broth. But in each dish, the vegetables hadn't had time to develop flavor or even soften much -- the whole dish had certainly not come together. We found ourselves dousing dishes in the spice blend (seasoned salt) and hot sauce (although even that was not too hot) available at the table.

One last disappointment with these entrees: We both asked for shrimp to be added on top of our dishes (for an extra charge -- or, you can ask for crawfish instead), but the shrimp was unseasoned, flavorless popcorn shrimp out of a can. I find their texture and appearance repulsive (even though I love bigger sized shrimp), so that was especially disappointing.

Seeking redemption, we finished with pie. My husband had the raspberry, and I had the pecan. Both are made fresh on site and served warm. The pies were runny. The pecan had decent flavor, but seemed under-stuffed. There wasn't much to the piece. The raspberry, my husband said, tasted as if it had been made with canned filling rather than fresh fruit, more like vague red-berry goo than raspberry. It was also runny and under-stuffed. There are better pies locally, such as the old Pies by Inge at Monticello's Brown Bag or the ones that are made by a local lady for the Arcade Diner in Paxton.

The coffee that went with the pie was very good.

The meal cost around $50. It was not a great value for the money, even if it had been better. Given the quality of the cooking, I'm sorry to say we won't be back.

Perhaps the food's poor preparation accounts for the lack of business tonight -- the dining room had only a couple of tables occupied when we arrived and was nearly as empty when we left.

I'm sorry to put in a bad review. They seemed to be trying really hard, but there's no help for poor cooking in a restaurant promising down home food."}
{"text":"From the January 21, 2013, Champaign Urbana News Gazette:

Leah Pettit will soon introduce Champaign-Urbana diners to Mississippi-style barbecue and an array of dishes from New Orleans.

Her restaurant, Louie's Dixie Kitchen, is set to open at 1104 N. Cunningham Ave., U, on Jan. 28, with a grand opening slated for early February.

The location is the former site of El Toro, which moved up the street to 1601 N. Cunningham Ave., U, last fall.

Since then, Pettit and her business partner, Dirk Bodine, have renovated the old El Toro building to make it resemble a Southern shack with a porch.

Louie's will be open for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and customers will have a wide selection from which to choose.

For lunch, look for barbecue, shrimp po' boys, muffuletta sandwiches, red beans and rice, gumbo and jambalaya.

For dinner, choose from all that and more, including crawfish pie, etouffee, shrimp-and-grits and fried chicken dinners.

Louie's breakfast menu will include sausage gravy and biscuits, French toast, eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, omelets and grits.

\"We'll eventually add a Saturday brunch, where we'll have things like Crab Cakes Benedict -- more upscale food,\" Pettit said."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I popped over here for some takeout, mostly because they were doing a benefit that day and offering 10% of all sales to the local humane society. My boyfriend got a pulled pork sandwich with fries and I got an order of cheese fries. That was pretty much my only vegetarian option, but I don't really expect many non-meat choices from barbecue places anyway.

I was a little perplexed when I saw that the pork sandwich was $5, where as the cheese fries were $6 (+$2 if you wanted bacon on top). What I got for my $6 was just sad. Maybe a handful of soggy fries in a big to-go box, with a drizzle of liquid cheese - much less viscous than you'd expect from cheese fries.

My boyfriend's fries were similarly disappointing, though the sandwich was more mediocre than anything. I mostly can't believe we paid $6 for the amount of fries I got, and for what was allegedly an appetizer, which you might be meant to share with others. It was more like what you'd pay *maybe* $3 for an any burger joint.

As to the restaurant itself, the floor of the women's bathroom was incredibly sticky, though decorated well. We only sat in the front area waiting for our food, so I can't speak to the actual dining area. All in all, next time I'll cut out the middle man and just donate directly to the humane society."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast. Ordered a half order of biscuits and gravy and my boyfriend ordered eggs, bacon, and toast. Our food was cold, the \"biscuits\" were canned biscuits the size of a half dollar, the gravy had no seasoning on it at all, the toast was untoasted, and the egg whites were runny and clearly under done. Most disappointing."}
{"text":"Sampler trio jambalaya gumbo and red beans and rice. Yummy"}
{"text":"I've been very excited to try Louie's as I love Cajun food.  I went during lunch time and I was not disappointed!!  I ordered shrimp & grits, the Louie house salad, and mango green tea.  Every single bite was AMAZING.  I was especially pleased with their mini muffin they served with the salad.  I ordered extras because they were so wonderful.  Service was good.  No complaints at all.  My totaly bill for all that food was $12.83.  Extremely reasonable prices. Wish they had more parking but I got there early enough it wasn't a problem.  Looking forward to when they get their liquor license.  Will for sure be going back soon."}
{"text":"I asked the hostess how long they'd been open, and this is the third week.  I'm pleased to report it is apparently getting better than the previous reviews indicate.  I had Friday lunch, at 12:15 and the food and service were good.  I had a muffaletta sand and a side salad, with green goddess dressing.  They serve a complimentary basket of chips when you are seated that were not particularly good.  The sandwich roll was chewy and good, the fillings generous and tasty.  There was a little too much oil in the olive relish for my taste.  My service was fine, but there seemed to be some confusion at the tables seated around me.  Hope they figure it out, because the good outweighs the bad in this place."}
{"text":"I really wished I'd looked at the reviews before stopping by this place.  I was excited to see what would move into El Toro's old location, and was intrigued by the prospect of a cajun restaurant.

Stopped by here for lunch--the parking lot seemed pretty full but it wasn't bustling inside as much I thought it would be.  It took a few minutes for us to be seated, even though the restaurant was less than half full, there was only one other customer (paying at the register), and quite a few staff walked by (\"they'll be with you in a minute\"....uh ok, aren't you one of THEM?).

Ordering and whatnot went smoothly enough.  A few minutes after we ordered, a basket of chips was placed on our table.  They were ok, but served cold (not even room temp) and some of them were soggy.  Bleh.

Food came out in a reasonable amount of time.  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with fries and was just...unimpressed.  I'm no BBQ connoisseur or anything, but the pork looked really unappetizing and gray.  The sauce was served on the side, COLD.  Why would I want to put cold sauce on a hot sandwich?  Despite being cold, the sauce was pretty good, and definitely helped the pork (which I thought was salty and otherwise flavorless).  The best part of the sandwich was the bun, which was honestly very very good.  But if the best part of a pulled pork sandwich from a cajun place is the BUN....well, I feel like something is wrong.  The fries were nothing special and I barely touched them.

When I went to pay, there was once again a wait despite there being no other customers and multiple staff-people around.  I guess only one person is allowed to use the register?  The front-end of the restaurant, in general, seemed really disorganized.

Overall: underwhelming food, unremarkable service.  The food was really cheap, so I'll give it two stars ($4.95 for the sandwich + fries, plus the free chips).  Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Catfish nuggets were good. Crawfish stew  was good. Service fine. Overall good meal."}
