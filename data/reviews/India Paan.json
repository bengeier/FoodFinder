{"text":"India Paan is where I have been going to fufill all my paan needs.  Prior to walking into this place one fine day I didn't even know I had paan needs.  Apparently they specialize in \"Maghai Calcutta & Banarasi Paan.\"    So what does that mean to me?  Well, I like to get three things here:  1) Puri Paan - crispy little cups filled with delicious spicyness, chickpeas, red onions, and other stuff.  Make sure to order spicy water with it (which, by the way, is supposed to be poured into the little cups).  2) Sweet Paan - it's a bunch of sweet spices, seeds, rose petals, and other unfamiliar things wrapped up in a beetle leaf.  You just eat the whole thing.  Depends on who's making them - I've had them range from really tasty to just okay.    3) Sugar Cane Juice - made fresh in front of your eyes - that alone will set you back about $6, but it's so yummy!  Now when you go in there you won't feel like a complete dope - definitely worth going in for a sample.  Mmmmmmm Paan.  They also make a mean spicy corn on the cob - made my mouth burn for HOURS.  Consider yourself warned."}
{"text":"Totally useless business. Was on a trip to Toronto city and found this place. I was so excited to try sugarcane juice after a long time but had horrible experience. I Went inside to pay and by the time came out the juice was given to me in a cup. It felt impossible to make one glass juice in less than a minute. I asked the girl outside if the juice was fresh and she said that she just squeezed it.  Well it didn't taste fresh. Went back and returned the juice. The owner had courage to say that it was fresh (he was sitting inside) and didn't even offer any apology or courtesy to change it. Just trashed the juice in front of him and walked away. Too bad..I would not even give 1 star to this place"}
