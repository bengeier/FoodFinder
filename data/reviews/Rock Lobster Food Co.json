{"text":"Very good place for all things lobster! I had the lobster Mac and cheese and the lobster poutine. Very good!  The place is quite small and tends to get busy during prime dinner time. We knew this so we went early and had no problem getting seats. As the evening progressed the lines grew outside.   Service was friendly and accommodating. We ordered a bunch of stuff for apps and we wanted to share. They're more than happy to bring extra cutlery and plates.   Yum! I think I may need to go back soon to satisfy my lobster craving!"}
{"text":"AS GOOD AS IT GETS. took my mom and friend from out of town they both said things were fresh, ingredients tasted like they were suppose too! Great food :)"}
{"text":"The service was good, but the food was MEH. Nothing tasted seriously awful, but there was nothing I tried that knocked my socks off. I had the Maine lobster roll which came with soggy fries and a really tiny roll. I mean, there were chunks of lobster but the entire thing was the size of my hand and my hand is pretty darn small. For $18 a small roll that was lacking flavour... I felt cheated (especially since I had a much better lobster roll w/ fries at the CNE for $5 less). My fianc√© had the crab legs and shrimp combo and he liked it but the portions, once again, didn't seem to correspond with the price. My friend had the bisque soup and I honestly don't understand that dish. Maybe it caters to a certain type of foodie but having your soup taste like coffee just threw us off.   Anyway, I was hoping to love this place because I LOVE seafood but I wasn't all that impressed. I must say though, they do have delicious Caesars. Mmm wouldn't mind one right now."}
{"text":"It was a good experience. We had the three cheese dip for starters. The dip was very unique& i really liked it. Even the chips were good. I had the lobster maine roll w/fries and it was very good although missing some sauce in my opinion. The rest of the group had the buffalo shrimp roll & the lobster roll w/lobster poutine.   I tried them all & loved the texture of the buffalo shrimp the most. It made me think of trying the same sauce on the maine lobster roll.   Overall it was a good experience but $97 was a bit pricy for 3."}
{"text":"I had the misfortune of dining here recently. My companion and I were unamused.  This place sucks. I'm sorry, and I had high hopes, but Rock Lobster is overrated and completely disappointing in every way.  To begin, the staff is surly and overworked. That wouldn't be so bad, but the food is poor as well.   We ordered the lobster roll and it was the worst, smallest lobster roll I have ever had in any city or country. Do not order this.   We had the lobster boil; again, very mediocre. Advertised as a 1.2 L lobster, it was much smaller in person. Bait and switch much?  Save yourself the disappointment and go somewhere else, Rock Lobster is an embarrassment to Toronto."}
{"text":"Lobster roll is small but good. 2 stars because it took 40 minutes to get the sandwich and the server never bothered to tell us there is going to be a delay!"}
{"text":"Stay here for the lobster pourtine. The service is great and the Lobster poutine taste great. Will definitely come back for full meal"}
{"text":"From food truck to restaurant, I'm a little iffy about this place.  Our wait wasn't horrendous (as some have experienced in the past), we were seated within 20 mins (our waitress did apologize and asked if we waited in line for a long time, so I guess the short wait we had was a bit unsual).   That night - there was only 1 bartender working (the other one was on his first day so I won't hate).  Let's start with the famous Caesar's...I didn't find anything special about it. Yah it comes with half a lobster tail...but the lobster was old and over cooked (you can tell when it doesn't come out of the shell easily and comes apart all stringy).  The actual drink was mostly clamato juice.  We went to Hoof raw bar after this and tried their caesar's which were a huge improvement to my drink here!  Appetizer was so-so. The beef tartar ...was disappointing - the meat was stringy and full of tendon meat, so it was very unsatisfying.   Rock lobster roll was a bit better. But again...nothing I would be really inclined to come back for.    Onto the mains - the seafood tower was much better.  Ordered the smaller sized tower (after the bad lobster experience in my drink, I couldn't see the point in paying more for the larger tower which comes with lobster).  all in all...it was nice to try this place, but won't be back again."}
{"text":"First impressions: throbbing rock music being cranked out of the tinny speakers gave off a sportsbar-like vibe rather than that a casual lobster shack. The music was too loud (everyone was yelling at each other) and we had to ask for it to be turned down. They kindly obliged. The Canadiana theme seemed a bit tired (as did the waitresses, who were all \"cute\" in their matching plaid shirts).   I've been eager to get a lobster roll of the east coast variety in Toronto, so was looking forward to it. Unfortunately, all the portion sizes are very small and me and my friends had to go eat a dinner part 2 elsewhere. I had a lobster \"cappuccino\" in addition to the lobster roll, and felt both were lacking in flavour. I couldn't place what was missing. My partner's steak was cold, and a friend's surf and turf was tiny. It seems you need to order two dishes per person, which might bring the cost of the food part of the meal to $30. At that point, I would rather spend $25 on a really good entree than on two snack-sized portions of OK lobster.  All in all, the service wasn't bad, it was just awkward. We were seated at a 8 person long bar table along a wall, which made it very difficult for the waitress to give us our food and take our plates away."}
{"text":"Having opened just at the start of December as part of the sexy Ossington food scene, the place has been a-buzz non-stop. That isn't surprising, really, considering the massive python of a snaking line up they'd be touting at each and every event they would participate in. I myself always knew it was well worth getting in that line, and I knew it would likewise be worth a line up here. Yep, like so many hot spots in the city with limited seating (72 in total) and relatively quick turn around, RLC doesn't take reservations. Thankfully for us, we just slipped in under the radar (at the early hour of 7:30) and landed a deuce right away and by 9 PM on a chilly Saturday night, the place was completely packed. In such small quarters, that not surprisingly translates itself to me speaking at a higher than normal decibel and then paying for it when I wake up sounding a little like a slightly more classy version of a blue-haired cartoon character whose name rhymes with Narge. Yeah, it's loud in there, but honestly no more so than every other restaurant I've visited of late, and I'll always choose hearing music and chatter over the abrasive sound of cutlery in a hauntingly quiet space. Especially if said chatter is coming from a table of eight (yes eight!) good looking men to my left. Single (or not so single) ladies, take note. Lobster is inherently hot.  Service at RLC was friendly and efficient. Cocktails were delivered almost immediately, water glasses were refilled, and the food began emerging surprisingly quick. Only 40 minutes in, and we were ready for dessert, and yet, I thankfully was never made to feel the push to gobble up and leave. When all was said and done, we were in and out in about 1 1/2 hours, which is my preferred casual dining time. The cocktail menu, created by Josh Lindley (of Campagnolo and GwaiLo), is incredibly enticing and exciting, offering a wide range of some of my favourite seasonal flavour profiles. In addition to the 7 cocktails and the 4 draught beers, Lindley also features 3 wines on tap, a unique bar feature that's a steal at only $1 per oz (for Ontario). But it wasn't until after the fact that I even cared to look at the drink menu, because I had my heart on one thing and one thing only- their signature Rock Lobster Caesar ($12). A Caesar girl as it is, I just had to look around the room at all of the lobster tail adorned cocktails to know what I'd be drinking that night. And this Caesar is a fiery version, for sure, with an extra kick from the pepper-heavy, satisfyingly salty steak seasonings along the rim. While I probably would have preferred a touch more Clamato to balance out all the heat, I was really impressed by the generous lobster tail peeking out of the top of my glass. An appropriate warm up to our imminent lobster marathon.  And speaking of said marathon, this is what we had:  Lobster Poutine: Yukon Gold Hand-cut Fries, Lobster Bisque Gravy, Quebec Curds, Fresh Lobster and Chives ($13) Off to a decadent start. Hidden beneath a much-appreciated Mount Everest of sumptuous lobster bits laid a bed of seemingly sturdy fries. Despite the generous portion of protein, and the even cover of gravy, the fries remained crispy and light for our (albeit short) eating episode. And while the lobster was fresh and tender, and the curds let out a gentle squeak, it was the gravy that sent me into a mild state of anxiety as the portion started to shrink. With characteristics of any good bisque, it was creamy without a burdensome weight, and salty but with a hint of natural sweetness to balance. It was the kind of gravy I could happily drown my low- fat Special K with and feel simultaneously both virtuous and indulgent.  Lobster Mac and Cheese: Fresh Lobster, Aged Canadian Cheddar and Panko Crust ($13)  Classic and comforting, with no need for contrasting colours, shapes, unique plating or garnishes, and yet, it truly looked like a blue ribbon dish. Appearance aside, this preparation is my preferred \"style\" of a mac n' cheese- adequate sauce coverage, lots of cheesy pull, and a crispy golden crust on top.  It definitely wasn't as lobster-laden as the poutine, but the bits were chopped more coarsely, so that some bites were practically just shellfish with a little cheese. When you hit that gold, it's not something to complain about, really. With regards to the MnC itself, I found the flavour to be a little more subdued than I would normally want, however, in retrospect, I wonder if a more pungent cheese may have completely dominated the delicate shellfish.  Regardless, a tasty, decadent dish in a generous portion for sharing.  Surf and Turf Steak Tartare: Steak Tartare and Vanilla Butter Poached Lobster, Yukon Chips and Sea Salt ($12)  From the menu description, we were both expecting a portion of steak tartare AND some part of the poached lobster separately...."}
{"text":"My husband and I were going to see a show last night, and were looking for someplace close to grab a  quick meal prior to the show.  We popped into Rock Lobster Food Co. and were pleasantly surprised.  Fortunately, we were seated immediately .  It was close to the door but no big deal, I  actually liked being able to look outside and take stock of all my surroundings.  Our waitress was also the hostess. I think being on double duty was a little rough on her but the gentlemen, who I now believe to have been the owner, was right in the mix of things helping out.  There were obviously regulars coming in to dine, who were greeted warmly,  but as a patron just coming in, we were treated with just as much warmth but without the hugs.  The atmosphere  was also very comfortable and down to earth.  no pretense.  great vibe. great music.  People were enjoying themselves all throughout.  It made me happy just to be there.    As for the food, we were pleased with that as well.  We ordered  a lobster roll and lobster poutine.  We ended up ordering another lobster roll.  Partly because it was so good but partly because it might have been nice to have a little more to eat.  However I believe the portions were priced appropriately.  The service was great.  Our waitress took great care  and  was attentive.  I know people were waiting for our table and even while we were finishing up our drinks, not once did she make us feel as though we were being rushed.  We were very appreciative.  Thank you for a wonderful meal and experience."}
{"text":"Total disappointment - had the Maine roll - guy told us it was the best thing on the menu - if that was the best, then guys you need to pull up your socks - mostly buttery bun and a whack of twice-fried - dry and hard as rock - fries.  This menu is tone-deaf to people's eating habits - how about a little green on the plate or at least the option of that - it isn't hard to provide some healthier options without penalizing people by making them pay more for a whole salad as well - the choice was either a large salad - with no options to put seafood on that - or a roll - with no greens  - boring and sad considering the name.  The service was effusive and needy - \"how was that - it's great right?\" and after our meal... \"What are you guys leaving?!\"  Basically - this was red lobster with a 60 dollar price tag for two - never coming back"}
{"text":"My sister, partner and I went to Rock Lobster (on Queen) after hearing about their patio. Sadly, our experience was lackluster. Firstly, there is no music on the patio and it kind of feels a bit dead even with people everywhere.  We had caesers, poutine and fish tacos. The ceasers were really good but thats pretty much it. Both the poutine and fish tacos lacked flavor and certainly weren't worth the price. My sister and I had wine but it was from a keg and had a large amount of sediment in it which wasn't too appetizing.   Despite all this, our service was really good and it is a nice patio (although very quiet). I would go back for a ceaser but that's about it!"}
{"text":"First time: Positive experience. The food was tasty and the drinks were well-made. We sat at the bar and enjoyed the boisterous atmosphere.  Second time: We rolled in on a Saturday night and were told that there would be an hour wait. Hey, that is what it is (our bad for not making reservations). However, it never goes down well with me when I get stank from the host for having the audacity to show up in the first place.  I'm a sucker for good service but -- barring that -- even a smile and a shrug will totally do. We didn't get that.  I checked in by phone about an hour and 15 later and found the response to being even more dismissive.   To their credit, they did call us back eventually (probably 1:40 after our initial visit) but we already filling up on Golden Turtle pho (a review for a later time) by then."}
{"text":"I brought my mom here for her first authentic Nova Scotian meal after she moved from Halifax to Kelowna last year. We were very excited about the menu and the great reviews and were very much looking forward to our meal. While the decor was great and the service was excellent, we were sorely disappointed with our food. We ordered oysters (decent but small), beet salad (flavourless), scallops (served lukewarm - twice) and lobster mac & cheese (boring - could have used diced tomatoes and some spice to add some personality to the pasta). An excellent concept that just needs a little finesse in its execution."}
{"text":"Went for Summerlicious and food was pretty mediocre.. I thought $25 was quite expensive considering the portion sizes were so small... Had to wait 30 mins to be seated when we had reservations at 7:30pm. Their menu also changed in comparison to the website - we were excited to try a few things and they were not available. I'm not sure if I would come back.. should have went to Librettos across the street for a $17 of which I would have left full.."}
{"text":"went here for the first time and had the $25 summerlicious menu. Even for $25 I find that it was not worth it at all. I had the smallest taco ever, lobster roll was good but it was very small. I expected them to freshly cook or heat up the lobster but it was so cold. I'm not even sure if its fresh. The chips that came with it was so hard over fried that was it too hard. Dessert was okay. I can have a better meal for less than that price somewhere else."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. The service was far from satisfactory.. half our party got our food and it sat there getting cold for 10 minutes, while the other half got their food ten minutes later. When I asked if I could take the rest of my food to go, I was told \"No\". When the server returned I had asked why I couldn't and her response was that someone had ordered a large take-out order earlier so now they are out.  Pretty disappointing. Probably wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Having such a great experience here!! The food is amazing! The flavor's are PHENOMENAL!   The staff is super friendly (Brie is amazing!) and I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Was there for my first time, as a Food Network, episode of \" You Got\"a eat here \", food was OVER PRICED for what they give you, and food on menu, like crab balls, weren't balls at all, it was grab, with 2 piece of 2 inch corn.$ 28.00. Hot shrimps, as in spicy, 6 of them, $ 14.00, soup chowder, ( didn't have lobster soup ), $16.00 served in a bread bowl, and guarantied to give stomach problems. To me, a restaurant, that airs on Food Network, is a restaurant that is having problems, surviving. Music was way to loud, it looked like a dance bar as music had to much base. Food was ok, had better lobster at Red Lobster restaurants."}
{"text":"You might want to take this review with a grain of salt... it was Valentine's day after all, and nothing says romance to an east coaster like lobster. Even on Vday, we were able to get a table for two before my lobster tail Caesar hit my lips, which is a good thing because that drink required you to be sitting down to drink it eloquently. The lobster was incredible, poutine covered in bisque and curds and layered on a bed of fries. Being a bluenoser I feel the right to judge the lobster I eat in Toronto, and I judge this as the best I have had. The lobster roll was stuffed in an understated, white, hotdog style bun, as it should be. The seafood tower was more than enough food for two hungry romantics who had already overdosed on lobster, but we left nothing but a crab leg go to waste. Fresh oysters, peel shrimp and crab legs were cooked to perfection, not overdone as I find they often are.  We were taken care of as soon as we walked in this place, I almost felt like I was back home eating at a fire hall lobster supper. Good spirits, good seafood and good drinks; I have found a legitimate piece of my east coast rock right on Oss. These Upper Canadians got things right."}
{"text":"The latest Toronto popup to go brick-and-mortar style is Toronto Underground Market fav Rock Lobster Food Company. They settled in this past weekend and opened their doors for the first time Saturday night. We visited Sunday right at opening and were greeted by friendly staff eager to follow up opening night.   Atmosphere  The decor was nice, tied in well with the seafood style with wood trimming abound. The couch adjacent to the wall was quite comfortable and it appeared as though the entire restaurant could seat about 60 with some extra room leftover. Greeting you as you come in to be seated is a mouth-watering raw bar. Further down is the more traditional bar which includes a neat feature that I haven't seen in Toronto, wine-on-tap. This feature was not quite ready for launch, but owner Matt told us that he will have it operational soon and that he is the first one to bring this to the city. There are a couple VQA wines available for $1/oz, which is not bad. The music is a crossover between classic rock & hip hop at a decent volume. Brittney Spears was played at one point, to which Matt quickly got rid of and apologized. Rogue employee playlist or something more sinister?   Drinks  We started out with the Rock Lobster Caesars, RLF's take on Caesars with a nice big beer mug and a lobster tail shoved in because why not! They were delicious with a solid kick, and the lobster tail was a nice contrast for the drink. Post meal we tried a couple of cocktails off the menu: Queen Pickle and White Rabbit. The  latter was far superior, a nice sour mix with delicious Tromba Tequila to stand on.  Eats  To start out we ordered two oysters each, one of each kind they had. Unfortunately their supply had been wrecked from opening night so they were down to one kind. Very fresh and delicious. We also had the Lobster Cappuccino which is the RLF take on lobster bisque and oh-boy did they nail it. Incredible bisque with nice chunks of lobster, chives and topped with Cr√®me fraiche. Matt described his process in creating this dish and how he wanted to really nail it as a fresh take on bisque and he delivered. Our third and final appetizer was the jerk crab & shrimp. Be prepared to get messy eating this, you will be fully covered in oils and spices when finished. Trust me when I say it is totally worth it. The jerk spices were done the right way and didn't overpower the crustaceans at all. As all of the seafood we sampled tonight, it was fresh and delicious. Lastly, the mains came in. Lobster rolls, and the legendary RLF rolls are on the money. I don't believe I've had a better lobster roll anywhere and I've had a few.  Verdict  Matt owner/chef came by our table a couple of times. You can tell he has a passion for his work and his cooking and it really comes across both in person and in the food. We told him that we hadn't had seafood this good since a trip to Boston years ago. Service was on point all night (even the bartender came out to check up on us), everyone was super friendly and enthusiastic. The web site definitely needs some work, namely menus and pictures of the new joint, but honestly that is how far I had to reach to come up with a complaint about this place. I am eager to see if they will maintain their high standard and will definitely be back soon to try out some more items. Lobster Poutine anyone?"}
{"text":"Went here with friends, excellent food!! If you enjoy spicy food, you gotta order jerk crab and prawn, it's soooo good. My friend ordered The Boss, basically it's a tower of cold oyster, crab, and prawn, he enjoys it, but if I'm eating seafood, I want my meal hot/warm. The other friend order lobster dinner, it was ok, portion huge. I ordered the tacos as well, it was yummy. But seriously, the jerk crab and prawn is highly recommended. Can't wait to come here again."}
{"text":"Excellent! The food is well sized portions, delicious and well worth the price.  The oysters were very fresh and served with 3 types of sauces and horseradish. The jerk shrimp and crab was fantastic! The lobster poutine had us wanting more! We also had the pork belly, skirt steak and crab legs. Everything was very good. The staff is friendly, knowledgable and accommodating.  The loud rock music makes for a fun experience."}
{"text":"The best value snow crab I have seen in Toronto. We got the Tower with shrimp, oyster and crab- a great choice. The lobster macaroni was also really tasty. Looking forward to heading back soon!"}
{"text":"I came here for the lobster poutine and ended up having dinner.  As part of La poutine week, Rock Lobster was advertised as one of the options and due to when they open (5pm), we ended up having dinner while we were there.  We lucked out and the lobster boil was discounted to $25 which includes a boiled lobster, side of fries, and beans.  I thought it was delicious.  I thought at $25 it was reasonable for what I got but regular price (I think $45) is a bit much.  The lobster poutine we all thought was pretty good although they were a bit stingy on the lobster.  Decor, it was okay, nothing to write home about.  It has a bar with TVs if you ever wanted to stop by for a game."}
{"text":"What a great time! I had great food with rocking music. Loud enough that I couldn't hear others around me but not that I couldn't hear my date.   Food was great at a great price. Service was OK but I'm not going to hold it against her as I think she was new.   Definitely going again."}
{"text":"I wish I could say I \"ate\" here, but I didn't. The service was so bad the night we walked in, we gave up after AN HOUR of sitting in our seats with only our drinks served and no order in! It's a shame because I was actually digging the ambiance! The menu looked decent and I was looking forward to trying the lobster poutine!  Hopefully, service will be better the second time around...."}
{"text":"This review is for Queen st location.  Hipster red lobster. For a place that cares to be seafood centric, most were poorly prepared. popcorn clams were oily overcooked breading with not really there, dried out clam. Rubbery overcooked shrimp with not very complimentary blue cheese BBQ sauce. Lobster chowder was ok but felt also like a bowl of cream and gluten. Service was poor, asked for 3 spoon, twice and after 20 min wait got 1 spoon. Why? Because they ran out of spoon, as per the waitress. The only thing that was decent was the lobster roll but small and overpriced. Not recommended."}
{"text":"Highly recommend that any seafood lover take at least one visit to Rock Lobster.  Offers some usual dishes like poutine and Mac and cheese with a seafood twist,  and traditional fish only options.  Pricing was reasonable and the atmosphere was great.   Can't wait to head back!"}
{"text":"After trying their tasting at Toronto Underground Market last fall I was eager to check this place out. Not taking reservations is always a little annoying and I ended up waiting an hour for a table of four around 5 on a Saturday. Once we were seated the service was speedy and the menu was great. We ordered the poutine, mac and cheese, surf and turf and lobster roll. The portions were enough to give you a great taste but if I went back I'd be sure to get some appetizers. Decent selection of beer and loved the decor. This place is very Toronto right now."}
{"text":"Brief overview: Bad service, and the food was just mediocre. The lobster didn't have that sweet and fresh seafood taste. Plus, the meat was chewy.  The experience: The restaurant was full, so we waited at the bar. I was sitting right in front of the beer tap when the server/bartender began filling an order. She accidentally sprayed beer all over me, covering my hair, shirt and arms; some also landed on my jeans. She apologized, and I understand it was just an accident. She began filling the order again, and again she sprayed beer all over me. No apologies this time. She proceeded to pretend to fiddle with the tap and tried to fill the order again. I guess I was in the wrong for still remaining in the same spot, as she once again sprayed beer on me. No apologies again.   I finally moved from my seat to one farther down the bar. I watched as she complained that something was wrong with the pressure of the tap. She signaled for a fellow server/bartender. She dipped her hand (one that I saw her handling money with just minutes before) into the beer that was in the mason jar, and said the foam is coming out all \"liquidy\". The guy then poured beer into a different mug, without any issues, and tested it. He says it does taste a little flat before returning back to what he was doing without offering any solutions. She then handed the mason jars out to a waitress to serve to the customer, who would unknowingly drink beer that she has dipped her dirty hand in.   Shouldn't proper training be provided to staff on how to pour beer? Also, if she feels like something is wrong with the product (even if it's just a little flat beer), why would she send it out to a customer? And on top of that, it's unsanitary of her to dip her filthy fingers into someone else's drink. Nastier things probably happen in the back of the restaurant, but at least not in front of customers.    Now for the food. My friends ordered a Lobster Caesar and a Virgin Lobster Caesar while we were at the bar. Tasted both, and we all felt there was nothing more special than premade Caesars you can get from the store. Not worth the money.   We finally sat down, and our order included two Lobster Rolls, Lobster Poutine, Lobster Mac and Cheese and some other forgettable fish dish. The Lobster Rolls had too much mayo, which further distracted from the already-lack-of-seafood taste from the lobster. The Lobster Poutine was OK, as it was mainly just fries and gravy. Nothing special. No lobster taste once again. The Lobster Mac and Cheese was cheesy. I couldn't really see the lobster from the dish, and the meat that I could find was overcooked and chewy.  This place is definitely not worth the hype and money. You'd think that a restaurant with \"Lobster\" in its name would serve better lobster dishes. I guess you should never assume such things. Maybe it's just the Ossington location, but I'm not willing to give Rock Lobster another chance. 0 stars if it were possible."}
{"text":"Came here with the husband for dinner and ordered:  1) Oysters - we ordered the ones from PEI which were delish.  The cocktail sauce that came with it was good!   2) Lobster poutine - This was a disappointment.  I'm fairly certain that it said on their menu that they used their lobster bisque in the poutine which I thought would be their \"gravy\" however, the sauce looked like any ole gravy and didn't taste like a lobster bisque.  I think the reason why this was a disappointment is that lobster has such a subtle sweet flavour and can be very easily overpowered.  When I ate the poutine, all I really tasted was the gravy and the cheese, not so much the lobster.  The lobster certainly was not the star of the show.    3) Lobster roll - This was good.  Having spent a few years living in the East Coast, this was a good lobster roll.  I also liked how they had homemade chips instead of fries on the side and it also came with a big pickle!   4) Lobster mac n cheese - Another disappointment.  Same issue as the poutine, the lobster was totally overpowered by the cheese and in fact, my husband felt it was very salty and I felt it was flavourless.  We ended up having to ask for pepper to give it some flavour and even that wasn't enough.  Perhaps I should have asked for some ketchup...but doesn't that just take away from the fact that I'm supposed to be eating something so decadent? Also, there wasn't a lot of lobster meat compared to the amount of pasta and cheese in the dish.    Service was good - the staff was very attentive.    Overall, I probably wouldn't come back.  The prices aren't bad but for a place called \"Rock Lobster,\" you'd expect that the lobster would be the star of the show, unfortunately it was clearly a runner up to everything else."}
{"text":"No risk no reward. Unfortunately this time there was still no reward. I stopped in to try their lobster poutine for poutine week so I can't speak on the rest of their food. However their poutine was underwhelming and simply left me disappointed. First off there was no real visible lobster in the box. I dug through it and could only find sparse pieces of cheese that didn't event melt. The lobster bisque gravy felt like lobster bisque mixed with gravy which took away from the lobster taste and left it diluted and muddied. The fries tasted great but also overwhelmed the flavour of the already dulled lobster taste. Sadly the entire experience left me craving for a poutine and lobster fix from my own kitchen."}
{"text":"I came here for an anniversary dinner having heard many great things about this restaurant. We ordered the lobster mac n cheese to start ($14). We shared it and were not impressed at all with it. There was way to much much and cheese and not enough lobster. The chunks of lobster were barely the size of a nickle. I got maybe 3 chunks of lobster... it was dissapointing. We then ordered the lobster dinner ( I think it was close to 40 I could be wrong) it came with a small scoop of mashed potatoes, and cream of spinach. The sides were nothing amazing but the lobster it self was pretty bad. The shell was hard as a rock and the meat was all shriveled up. The lobster was also very small...   The waitress we had also wasnt the friendliest of people. She didn't come around once to refill our drinks or ask us if everything was ok. We also had to chase her down to get our bill.   over priced. over rated.   Not going back."}
{"text":"The good: Lobster Caesar offers an exotic twist on the familiar drink and really hits the spot. The bad: portions are small and leave you feeling hungry."}
{"text":"We came here for a work dinner a couple months back.   Between the 11 of us, we ordered a significant portion of the menus including a ton of oysters.   For the most part people were satisfied. I know a couple people ordered a second time finding what they had initially chosen to be on the small side. I don't know that anyone was blown away by their meal but truly no one was disappointed.   The music was kick ass, our server was the perfect balance of attentive and inconspicuous. I'll guess the gentleman was the manager, brought over a couple complimentary shots over the course of our time there which is a full two thumbs up.  For sure have the lobster tail caesar.   High fives."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night around 8pm as a group of 3. We were immediately greeted by the host and seated close to the window. The restaurant has a very clean and ambient vibe to it and I thought all the staff were talkative and helped create a very personal and comfortable environment for us to dine in. A friend and I had dinner already so we just ordered the only dessert they had called a whale tail ($8) with cinnamon sugar and creme anglaise, which we split. It's a very large portion and ideal for sharing. It's reminiscent of a beavertail pastry but not as sweet or greasy and has a cakier texture. I also ordered a traditional granita ($12). I don't remember what the ingredients are or what it really tasted like but the drink had a super strong liqour taste, almost to the point where it was unpleasant to drink but I drank it anyways. However, the people by the bar seemed to be enjoying their drinks so I guess it's just the granita? My other friend ordered dozen after dozen of their raw oysters ($2.50/each) between their two daily varieties available and a lobster taco ($6) which she didn't enjoy as much.   Overall, our waiter was very friendly and made us feel like regular customers. I think he did a wonderful job on his first day of work! Our water was constantly refilled and we easily stayed for almost 3 hours.   PS- Masterchef Canada season 2 contestant, Michael Motamedi sat right next to our table!.. but I chickened out/didn't want to have to awkwardly sit through dinner knowing I asked to take a pic with him... so I didn't. :("}
{"text":"We ordered food from here and it was a real disappointment. The lobster was dry and overdone. I would never order from here again. The prices were way too high for the quality of food presented. Sad really..."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times but only for their late snack menu and drinks. From my limited experience I can say their tacos are solid every time, the beet salad is delish and they serve a pretty good Caesar that's garnish with a lobster tail. I'm definitely curious to try their regular menu and will be back many many times."}
{"text":"Service was great. Our waiter was super professional and helpful. The food was ok, although the lobster was kind of small for a lobster place, but I guess the price is still good for what you get. The lobster dip could use a bit less cream. It was a heart attach waiting to happen."}
{"text":"Came here for summerlicious. Everything is awesome but the most memorable thing was their rock lobster Cesaer.. Complete w a lobster tail! If I ever go back, it'd be for a lobster cesaer ;)"}
{"text":"Now that I've tried Rock Lobster for myself, I understand what all the RAVING was about! My stomach was thanking me when I had that lobster roll... and then oyster rocka lobsta fella, lobster mac n/cheese and finally the flank steak.  Everything was cooked to perfection.  I can't wait for my next visit!!!"}
{"text":"Small place.  My hubby and I arrived right when they opened for dinner at 5pm, so we didn't have to wait.  I had the lobster poutine which was OK.  My hubby had the lobster mac and cheese, I wish I had ordered that instead!  The Caeser looked awesome!  Loved the presentation."}
{"text":"Restaurant: Rock Lobster Cuisine: Seafood Location: Little Italy Address: 110 Ossington Ave Price Range: $10~  1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 3  Service: 4  Ambiance: 4 Overall: 3.5  Extra information:  * Closed Mondays * Only open for dinner * Doesn't take reservation * Bar seating avail * Fresh seafood  Rock Lobster started off as a Pop up restaurant until they gained many loyal fans who wished for a standing restaurant just like La Carnita... and the wish was granted, tah dah!  Small but spacious restaurant on Ossington ave that has locals trailing in as well as lobster lovers that supported them ever since they started.  I never had the chance to try our Rock Lobster Food Co before they opened as a restaurant since I personally do not enjoy crowded events and lining up for food. So was I ever glad to find out they opened a standing restaurant! since I am always on the journey to finding my favorite lobster roll ever since bannock got rid of theirs from the menu.  Since they don't take reservation, me and my friends just decided to drop by around 8 and see how things turn out. It was on a saturday night but we didn't have to wait too long for a table. Restaurant has overall very laid back feel to it, a little dim with all the servers wearing flannel shirts with fresh seafood display on one side of their bar upfront. I already liked what I saw.  Their menu wasn't that extensive, mainly focusing on seafood such as snow crab, shrimp, oysters and lobsters.  Ordered: Rock Lobster Caesar 4/5  * Ketel One Vodka, Tobasco, Worchestershire, Steak spice, Clamato and Lobster tail for $12 * Of course I had to order this the moment I found out it had lobster tail in it * I love caesaes to begin with, it is one of my favorite cocktail * It is a pretty big cocktail, comes garnished with lobster tail and celery * I should've ordered it extra spicy since it wasn't very spicy to begin with  Ordered: Lobster Cappuccino 1/5  * Lobster bisque, creme fraiche, fresh lobster and chives for $6 * This was served with toasted baguette topped with lobster roll filling which I really liked * This was more so watery than I expected * I was expecting somewhat of a creamier soup but this was actually more like a drink * It had small pieces of lobster pieces inside * Personally I really did not enjoy this, it tasted really fishy and too waterly  Ordered: Lobster Mac n Cheese 2/5  * Fresh lobster, aged canadian cheddar and panko crust for $14 * I was excited to try this dish because how can you go wrong with mac n cheese + lobster * Excitement quickly died down when I tried a bite * This had no flavor was very bland, almost too dry * Would've preferred it somewhat more rich, and cheesy  Ordered: Crispy Maple Pork Belly 3/5  * Pork belly and creamed spinach for $12 * We were hesistant to order a meat dish at a seafood restaurant but we thought, it IS porkbelly! * It came with 4~5 pieces of pork belly which was very crunchy * The porkbelly has maple syrup glaze on top which made it quite sweet * I did enjoy it but am unsure if I like it as part of my main course  Ordered: Seafood Tower \"Crows Nest\" 5/5  * 8 peel and eat shrimp, 6 oysters and 2 snow crab clusters for $39 * This was quite messy to eat but I did really like it * Peel and eat shrimp is plump and fresh * Snow crab meat was sweet and the shell cracked somewhat easily * I did get crab juice and bits of meat all over myself though * Oysters were served with house cocktail sauce and horseradish on the side * We also got some rosemary yuzu sauce which I didn't particularly enjoy  Ordered: Rock Lobster Roll 5/5  * Lobster roll, yukon chips and McClure's dill pickle for $14 * I found my favorite lobster roll once again! * Served with soft white bread, they don't hold back on the lobster filling * Lobster is more so chopped up into small pieces, it's perfectly seasoned with just the right amount of creaminess * Cold lobster filling goes well with the bread and you get so much flavor with every single bite * I absoultely love their pickle, not too tangy and sweet enough it was very refreshing * For $14, this is a must get  Complimentary: Sipping Maple Crown Royal Whisky  Complimentary: Beaver Tail  * This was my first time trying a beaver tail! It is basically a deep fried dough covered in sugar. How can it be bad? I enjoyed every bits and pieces of it with extra maple sugar on the side.  Summary: I am glad restaurants like Rock Lobster is making it's way on Ossington Street. Their food is affordable and they serve fresh, quality seafood. Service is friendly and you know they are passionate and proud of what they do when the chef comes out to see how everyone is doing with their meal. Next time I drop by, I will most definately order the lobster roll and probably stick to fresh seafood. Welcome to Ossington and it was nice meeting you Matt!"}
{"text":"Crowded, over priced, hipsters version of Red Lobster. Ordered the lobster dinner and it made me giggle how cute the little lobster was. The sides were standard, flavors bland, nothing impressive. I don't see them lasting very long unless there was a over haul of the menu or new chef. Don't waste your money here, you can get a brew and good eats just a few doors down."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place.  I'm only not giving Rock Lobster a 5 because sometimes the service is far too slow but that to be expected in a popular restaurant.  Some bartenders and servers are more amazing than others, which is also to be expected, either way I LOVE their amazing caesars.  They were made better when they first opened but still have to order everytime.  The jerk shellfish is really messy, so be prepared, but its worth it, and very spicy, as I like it.  Unique sauce on crab I've never had before.  My boyfriend orders the mac and cheese and he loves it.  I love the price of wine per ounce, super helpful.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My first exposure to \"Rock Lobster\" was at the Toronto Undergound Market (TUM) where most would consider them a top \"winner\" at the event. Winning at Toronto Underground Market aka TUM is garnering the longest line amongst the patrons. At the time, they only served their Rock Lobster ROll and Lobster Cappuccino (which can be found on their current menu). Having been won over at TUM, I vowed to support their establishment once they opened.  Must Try's: Crispy Maple Pork Belly & Rock Lobster Roll. They're so good, one might even fancy ordering it twice (I know I'm guilty of that).   Crispy Maple Pork Belly is exactly as it's named and ten times as delicious sounds. The pork belly is perfectly crisp and mixed brilliant with their secret maple sauce. The creamed spinach served with it is fantastic.   Rock Lobster Roll is, I'm scared to say, one of the best lobster rolls I've ever had. I've tried and tasted many other creations in Toronto, but none compare to Rock Lobster. The bread bun is toasted with a garlic spread, and the lobster filling is generous to say the least.   To top it off the $1/oz Cabernet Franc is a great deal, and a perfect accompaniment to the entire meal.  Other notable mentions include: Lobster Mac & Cheese and Lobster Poutine. Both delicious in their own rights, but come in a close second to the dishes noted above.  Sidenote: Although not personally ordered, table neighbours ordered seafood towers \"Crows Nest\" and \"The Boss\" and the shrimp, oyster, crab and lobster looked fresh to death."}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular. Overpriced, . Uninteresting food. More like Red Lobster."}
{"text":"I used to come often to this location, but once the Queen West location opened it was more convenient for me to go there. When my friend suggested going back to this location last night, I was expecting the same experience I used to have - sadly this was not the case.  Our service was great - she came over enough to make sure our drinks were filled, but not enough to be annoying.  The food on the other hand was disappointing for all four of us. At our table we ordered two Rock Lobster Rolls, one Rock Lobster Burger, one Lobster Poutine, and one Surf & Turf Steak Tartare. Unfortunately the only thing that didn't have anything wrong with it was the Lobster Poutine.  Both the burger and the bun for the Lobster Rolls were charred. The steak tartare was way too salty, as were the chips that accompanied everything. The salt made those things inedible.  I think from now on I will stick with the Queen West location - I have never had any problems there."}
{"text":"Came to the original location after liking the second one on Queen street.  The first thing I notice is that the menu is half different between the two locations.  The amazing shrimp bucket wasn't at the Osslington one.         Lobster Mac'n'Cheese - it was a small dish, nice crunchy top layer, but soft and very  bland body.  Really disappointed by the dish on this night.  Maine Lobster Roll -  The side fries that were quite good.  The lobster roll, was about the size of a regular hot dog bun.  Although the lobster meat chunks were a good size, but it lacked in seasoning.  Maybe I'm just used to the regular cold Lobster roll as this one was meant to be sweet and warm, but I just didn't like it.   Lobster Taco - Small average tasting taco that is overpriced on the menu  I'll stick with the Queen location next time."}
{"text":"Lobster roll was mediocre, small. The ceasar was showy but nothing special. The Cherry manhattan was real gross. Nothing to see here -- try something else on the Ossington strip!"}
{"text":"I was in the neighbourhood and decide to give it a try.   Environment/Service: The place is easy to find and inside is a standard hipster casual atmosphere.  I went there when it opened (around 6pm) so it was pretty quiet.  They have a lot of wall decorations which gives it a nice vibe.  The waiter serving us was very nice - gave us a few recommendations on what's good since it was my first time.  Food came pretty quick as well and they were kind in asking how we were doing, whether we wanted take out boxes since we couldn't finish all the food.  Food - Lobster Poutine.  It's what you expect - lobster pieces with a poutine!  The gravy sauce was well made and it didn't cover up the lobster's taste.  It's a perfect side dish/appetizer to share with others if you have the fries craving.  The lobster meat, which I believe is the claw, is also refreshing. - Lobster Mac'n Cheese.  This one is very very cheesy!  But a little too cheesy that I found it a bit too much - but it's never enough cheese for some others.  The cheese on this dish did overpower the lobster pieces (which again is from the claw).  But it's been baked so it has a crispy touch when you put it in your mouth.  Overall it's nice for a first try.  I would come back to try some of their lobster theme cocktails.  Also, with a few more people, I can try more dishes.  Prices here is a little higher than I expected - but once in a while, it's not too bad."}
{"text":"- go as a couple or very small groups. this place seats like 30 to 40 max. - very loud with the music and crowd noise (had to strain a little over the 2 hours there) - lobster poutine is very solid and well priced (~$13). i was very impressed with the amount of lobster meat and how it complimented the cheese curds, fries, and slightly bisque-like gravy - lobster and shrimp ceviche was just ok. not your typically ceviche where the seafood is diced up small with tomatoes and cilantro. a little too much orange in the citrus juice/acidic component, and the meat was in large hunks - lobster tail in the caesar is a good novelty. very tasty caesar. lobster tail was small but enjoyable. - i wont be back soon, but would recommend going."}
{"text":"It was a good call.  Had dinner with my boyfriend and mother here on a Friday evening.  My boyfriend had been here previously and kept saying good things about it so we wandered in.  We started off with the chips and 3 cheese lobster dip... unreal. Just not enough chips to actually finish the dip with (heads up)... it was worth it.  There was lots of lobster pieces in it and the dip alone when we had scooped all the juicy meat out was awesome, too.  I had a lobster tortilla (delicious!) but I ended up polishing off my boyfriends fries.  I did not enjoy my arugula salad, the dressing was overpowering and I didn't eat it... and I wish they told me the seasonal vegetables I ordered was going to be corn on the cob because people who wear lipstick don't want to eat that... It was delicious.  But inconvenient.  It's like a casual gourmet comfort food restaurant.  The portions are very good, especially for the prices.  The staff are present.  The service was borderline slow initially, but tolerable since it picked up.  I'm really picky and always have to have a salad, usually if the salad tanks I won't leave happy... but this salad tanked and I'm still a fan.  This place is ace.    We will be back for the 3 cheese lobster dip and those homemade chips.  Lawdy!"}
{"text":"After reading the back and forth reviews we were a little unsure of what we were walking into.  We started with oysters which were a bit small but delicious. We split both the lobster mac and cheese, which was huge, and a lobster roll, which were both fantastic. Yes the lobster roll was small, it's a lobster sandwich, what else do you people want for $11? Order 2 next time if you're so upset about how large it isn't. The chips on the side were great, much preferred them to the usual french fries you get everywhere else.  The best part of the experience was the service. Our server looked like he just walked in from a skate park and started picking up tables but he could not have done a better job. Friendly, accommodating and even brought us a free drink on the house just because.  Couldn't recommend this place more."}
{"text":"I am eating my way thru Ossington right now and I was pretty excited to try out Rock Lobster last night. Walking into the joint, they were really busy but seated us immediately. The server was there in minutes to take our drink orders and they do wine by the ounce (always a bonus).   I ordered Oysters and then the Lobster Poutine. the BF ordered Lobster tail, Cesar salad and then the lobster mac n cheese... What baffled me was that the salad, mac n cheese and poutine all came out at the same time while we got the oysters and the lobster tail towards the end of our meal. When I inquired about it, figuring it was a mistake, they told me they like to get their food out within 5 minutes of ordering and that I need to request my appetizer to come to the table first if that's how I'd like to be served... (you can imagine my shocked face)   The service and food were good and the price was right, I just wished they would take the time to make you feel invited, rather than rushed and out of place."}
{"text":"I must admit I'm not the biggest lobster fan but I still enjoyed my experience at Rock Lobster. We had to wait about 30 - 45 minutes for a table on a Saturday night.  The service was excellent. We were greeted by a friendly hostess who was honest and open about the wait times. We grabbed a drink at the bar and the bartenders were all easygoing and great to chat with. Once seated, the food was delivered quickly and our server was very helpful answering our menu questions.   They have 4 beers on tap - Molson, Creemore, Guinness and a rotating craft beer selection (Lake of Bay's on my visit). The popular drink appears to be the lobster caesar, a classic caesar served with a lobster tail in it - very good. They also have a few wines on tap.    We ordered four dishes to share:  1) The Flank Steak was delicious, tender and cooked a perfect medium rare. They didn't ask how we like our steak cooked, but it was perfect for me. The steak was served with fried string potatoes and a huge duck egg (what's up with the egg?). A great choice if your not into seafood.  2) Lobster poutine - the fries were cooked perfectly with massive chunks of cheese curds and a generous amount of lobster and gravy. The dish was executed well but unfortunately slightly cold when it arrived at the table.  3) Lobster Mac & Cheese was very good and not overly rich which I liked. I didn't find the taste of the lobster stood out much in this dish, I didn't really taste it.  4) The Jerk crab and shrimp was a nice starter with crab legs and giant shrimp cooked with cilantro, lime and a nice spice mix. Warning - you need napkins for this one.  Only negative I would highlight is the loud music. If your seated near a speaker, It can be difficult to have a conversation.  If you craving a fun atmosphere, good food that's perfect for sharing (even if your not into seafood) and don't mind wearing a lobster bib, Rock lobster is the place for you.             BK"}
{"text":"Pretty good lobster!! I had my first ever lobster roll here and it'll be back for more.  The service was quick and friendly, the food was delicious and the prices are fair. At first I thought the menu was sort of limited, but based on what I saw and heard, other guests loved their dishes as much as I loved mine.   The lobster roll comes with kettle chips and a dill pickle; for $14 I wish the sides were a bit more plentiful, but nonetheless, really good. No complaints.   The atmosphere is a great fit for this trendy neighbourhood -- a little dark and romantic, and also a great place to hang with friends and family. It's a very laid back and comfortable spot.   The other items on the menu sounded amazing, and on Sunday nights, their Lobster supper is $25+tax, usually $39! How can you go wrong?"}
{"text":"It's pretty good! Nice caesars, decent lobster roll and the whale tail is pretty fun. Not super cheap, but good."}
{"text":"Way too noisy. Pardon? I SAID IT'S WAY TOO NOISY.  The food is alright but the atmosphere was not preferable.   We had the lobster poutine and roll, both of which were pretty good.   I don't remember what the shrimp dish we ordered was called, but it was like a deep fried shrimp appetizer that we chose because we asked the server to recommend a dish we could share. In my opinion, that one was a rip-off. There were only about five or six pieces of deep fried shrimp. They were small, unlike the size of Japanese shrimp tempura. There wasn't anything special about it, so after we finished it in about 2.3 seconds, it seemed a bit overpriced at $12-14. Relative to the dish they served it on (which, IIRC, was the size of a regular circular dish), the shrimp looked even smaller as they took up about 20% of the dish's surface. It was almost screaming, \"Where's the rest?\"  The Ossington location on a weekday night was far too noisy to have a decent conversation, so don't come here if you're looking to catch up with someone."}
{"text":"It was lobster roll was good, the Bloody Mary was awesome, and the ambiance was great. I would recommend this place and the Bloody Mary."}
{"text":"After hearing all the hype around this place I expected more. I had a good time but, the food was okay. The lobster roll was decent. Good bun to lobster ratio, but the yukon chips on the side was way too salty, I didn't end up finishing them. I would recommend getting the lobster supper that is usually $39 but was $25, a good deal. The lobster was cooked well and the sides the creamed spinach, mashed potato, and roll were good.   The place is a nice place to hangout and chill and grab a drink. Servers are friendly."}
{"text":"I stumbled here after trying to find a place for Post Game drinks to celebrate our teams awesome Ball Hockey Victory.  We were seated in the back with dim lighting that they eventually brightened for us after we requested a non romantic atmosphere.  Our table of 12 were all craving drinks and tons of food after our intense cardio activity.  We let our server know ahead of time that we wanted seperate bills and she easily accommodated us with no hassles or excuses which is always nice.  I ordered a cocktail, vodka sprite, and the Lobster Poutine.  I can tell you that I was skeptical about how good the Lobster Poutine would actually be...however when it hit my table I was pleasantly surprised with the Lobster to Poutine ratio.  For $15 for a poutine it is WORTH it because my poutine was at least 40% lobster which is a huge plus in my books!  The Mac and cheese was fresh and delicious as well along with the fish tacos.    This a great place on Ossington and I am glad we all stumbled in here.  We will definitely be back to hopefully celebrate more victories or drown our sorrows....either way...we will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Disappointing. I used to LOVE this place and come here ALL the time. Never had complaints. The most recent time I went I noticed the prices had gone up on a few items, by a dollar here and there, but was not bothered by it at first. The lobster roll used to  be awesome but this time mine and my boyfriend's bun was half empty that we could barely taste the lobster and my boyfriend had a nice piece of shell in his. I don't think it was worth the money at all seeing as it seems the portions have shrunken while prices have inflated and the quality is just not there any more. The server never asked us how anything was and basically ignored us the entire time. I have never had a problem with service there before and the hostess was perfectly nice. The server also did not even bother to clear off our table as more food arrived even though there was no more room on it. It just seemed like they were cutting a lot of corners and it was not a pleasant experience, considering how much I paid I was very very unimpressed. I have been there on very busy nights before and it has been much better. Sad to see this place going downhill and will be crossing it off my list."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant during Summerlicious and it is one of the best Summerlicious places I've tried. Their lobster roll is a delight. Their chicken and waffles is also delicious. Their fish tacos were phenomenal. Next time I go I'll try their Caesar as it has a lobster tail garnish. :) It's also in a great location to grab more drinks afterwards."}
{"text":"Showed up at 5pm on a Saturday with a party of 4 and were seated right away.   Here's the rundown on the food:   Lobster Roll: It pains me to say this, but it was just ok. The lobster was more shredded than chunky, there was a bit too much mayo, and the lobstery flavor didn't come through enough for me. It wasn't bad, but I wouldn't pay $14 for it again. I actually really liked the well-done chips and pickle that came on the side.   The Crow's Nest: You're better off just ordering the shrimp and oysters a la carte, because they both blew the crab out of the water (pun intended) in flavor and texture.   Rock Loster Caesar: Good portion, perfect amount of spice, and yes...a half of a Nova Scotia lobster tail. Again though, the lobster tasted kind of like nothing. Where is the lobstery lobsteriness?  Scott Howard Cocktail: Perfect and delicious  This place was not terrible, but it wasn't amazing. At a place with \"Lobster' in it's name, I expected to be hammered over the head with lobstery flavor and goodness.   While I do appreciate the fun concept and atmosphere, I doubt I'll be back. Too many more spots on ossigton to discover!"}
{"text":"***1/2 stars  It's always great to see a dream turn into a reality - such is the case for Rock Lobster Food Co., who started out as one of the popular TUM (Toronto Underground Market) vendors - upward wait of 1.5 hours for their infamous lobster roll.  Matt Pettit is the man behind the counter, but you will find him mingling with guests in his true down-to-earth fashion.    While his signature lobster poutine and lobster rolls are still up for grabs, you will also see non-sea items such as his take on a Steak Tartare, topped with morsels of lobster meat alongside house-made chips.    Seafood towers (a la Soci√©t√©) are also available (in 2 sizes).  The smaller one, aka The Crow's Nest comes with 6 oysters, 6 shrimps and 2 snow crab legs.  The larger one = lobster baby!  Another amazing thing?  Wine on tap!  That's right, and *gasps* what?!  $1 per ounce? Finally, a restaurant that isn't a party pooper by overcharging on the liquid calories.  No wonder they're so popular already!  Came here on a Thursday night with a group of friends and the place was packed.  The rectangular restaurant features mostly wood as it's main element of d√©cor.  My favourite would have to be the back wall leading to the kitchen, with a door looking like a port hole and the actual wall made of wooden lobster crates!  A semi-private dining area labeled the \"Anchor Room\" was also a focal point.  We feasted on:  Lobster Mac 'n Cheese - A bit on the light side.  I imagined a gooey, cheesy mess but what I got was probably more of what you'd see on a Jenny Craig menu (read, light).  The Crow's Nest Seafood Tower - Move over pissing shrimp, there's a new sheriff in town and it's called the pissing snow crab?  These shelled goodies were so juicy it doubled as a Nerf gun and I shot my dining companion in the eye with salty sea water.  Be careful - I've got a crab leg and I'm not afraid to use it!  The oysters were a decent size and I have to say the cocktail sauce is a winner!  It is not watered down; it is just thick enough to cling on to the seafood.  The shrimp were also a good size.    Flank Steak - Served medium rare with house-made hickory sticksm, topped with a fried duck egg and Crown Royal whiskey sauce.  This was delicious.  Word of advice, dip your steak instead of pouring the sauce over, as this is a cold sauce and you wouldn't want your food to get cold.  Crispy Maple Pork Belly - served with mom's creamed spinach.  They aren't lying when they said crispy!  Whale Tail - which bears striking resemblance to a beaver tail, but that wouldn't go well with the sea theme.  Fried pastry with cr√®me anglaise, cinnamon sugar and Canadian maple sugar.  The only dessert option.  I like the vibe at Rock Lobster.  I'm also glad that they are serving more than just seafood as that is not everyone's cup of tea and as a bonus, it's quite good!  The portion sizes aren't enormous, and we shared everything between 3 people.  A welcome addition to the Ossington strip!   My only one complaint was that table space is limited and the kitchen was way too efficient because the dishes came out one after the other like dim sum, only we didn't have a turn table ;)"}
{"text":"I feel really sad to give this place a 2-star, especially since it's definitely the chef's \"dream\" to have a restaurant. But when you're used to serving people fast and impersonal in a food truck, it makes sense that without real planning you can end up with an awkward dining experience.  So we went on a week night to Rock Lobster to partake in some tasty eating. When we arrived, the gentleman at the door seemed a little put out to greet us and quickly offered us the closest two-seater to the frigid door, despite having more seating just a few rows down. I asked if we could have one further from the door because it was cold. \"Oh, sure, yeah\" he said. He never spoke to us for the duration of the evening, despite bouncing to every table to inquire about the food. Weirdest part? He was the owner.  So, on to the meal. We ordered the lobster roll and a lobster mac and cheese and some drinks to start. To confirm, the beverages were totally worth their price. I ordered the pickled drink and my boyfriend got another, they were well-thought up and really beat the pants off other \"specialty cocktails\" I've had in other restaurants. Definite bonus points.  Now for the food. I really enjoyed the lobster roll, but it was a little small. It was served on what looked like a weeny hot dog bun and came with some cold chips on the side. It felt more like a lunch entree than a dinner plate, but the lobster filling was really tasty. The biggest crime is that my food came almost 15 minutes before my boyfriend's food arrived, with no indication from our server that there would be a time discrepancy. I waited as long as I could but eventually tucked in. I was completely done my drink and meal before the lobster mac and cheese came.   The lobster mac and cheese left a lot to be desired. It was bland, without much flavour and it was really watery. The cheese overpowered the lobster. My poor boyfriend toughed it out but he didn't appear to be very happy.  The part that really perturbed me was that nobody once asked us how our food was, despite the fact that the owner was literally talking up every table except us. He didn't even say good-bye when we left. At one point, he even told people on the waiting list (while we were still eating) \"Those two are leaving soon, so just wait inside.\" I was pretty miffed. Our server was also distant and it's a major pet peeve of mine to have our food arrive at such grossly different times. At least warn us.   I won't be returning to Rock Lobster the restaurant any time soon. If I see the food truck around, I'll perhaps grab a roll but not all food trucks are meant to be restaurants."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great caesar come here! Not only is it s but it comes with a lobster tail! This place is worth checking out because almost every food item tastes good. My favourite  is the lobster poutine and lobster mac and cheese. They portions are generous and you get lots of lobster in each entree. The atmosphere is relaxing and cozy. A must try!"}
{"text":"This was what was missing in my seafoodless life. A restaurant paying full homage to the great Canadian clawed Lobster. Who would have thought that a Toronto based joint could house such a fantastic lobster shack. I was pleasantly surprised.  I'm already a fan of the Ossington/Dundas hood, so having another great restaurant there doesn't hurt. Immediately walking through the doors, I felt comfortable. The seafood bar staring right in front of me, as spectacular anything could be,. It was gorgeous, full of snow crab legs, oysters, and other crustaceans, shellfish, marine living deliciousness.   While seated, I enjoyed the relaxing and casual atmosphere. Dim lighting, full tables, comfortable seats. The menu was simple. Not intimidating, divided into 3 main sections: raw bar, dishes and drinks. I ordered the lobster poutine, signature lobster roll and surf and turf steak tartare. I regret passing up their rock lobster Caesar- it has a Nova Scotia lobster tail in it! Next time...  The food came out reasonable quick, and I gotta say, everything was amazing. The poutine was the best poutine I ever had. Perfect fries, great gravy and squeaky cheese all under a mound of lobster. The lobster roll was equally good, not too saucy/mayo-ey, lobster was present and flavors weren't muted, bun was soft and toasty. Surf and turf tartare was my first foray into tartare and it was tasty. Mustard dressing, beef and chunks of lobster, all went well on the complimenting potato chips.   This dinner was the highlight of my night. It made me so happy. I didn't know what expect from Rock Lobster Food co. I thought it was going to be expensive and not filling. However, on the contrary, it was reasonably priced and satisfied my appetite.  I loved it. I had no complaints. Great food, good people and fun atmosphere- what else do you want from a seafood shack?"}
{"text":"We checked out Rock Lobster for Summerlicious - it was finally a reason to venture over here for a date night. We arrived just after 7 I think? Seemed like there was a long waiting list, but thankfully we love sitting at the bar, so we were seated right away. Decor is great - has a nice rustic charm. Staff very friendly. I am a Caesar fanatic so I had to try the Lobster Caesar - not going to lie, was the best Caesar I have ever had!! The rim salt was so addicting. I also got them to add olive juice to make it a bit saltier - soo good! I could definitely drink a lot of those easily...if they weren't 12$ lol. The Summerlicious (and regular) menu were reasonably priced for quality and quantity - can't expect to have cheap seafood obviously, or you'd be questioning where it came from. I had the Lobster Tacos to start & they were delicious! I was supposed to share one - but I didn't want to haha. For the main we got steak frites & lobster roll - both entrees packed with butter, but it went so well with everything and made it taste so goooood! The hickory sticks & kettle chips were so light and crispy - not greasy! For dessert, i had the whale tail - kinda like a funnel cake - soo yummy!   All in all, I'd give this place a 5 star if the drinks weren't so expensive, and if they had more beer taps. I think there were only 4 or 5 on draft? If the Caesars were brought down to 9 or 10$, I'd definitely have gotten more than 1 (and they stayed doubles :) )"}
{"text":"I loved the Lobster Roll and the Bartender was engaging and fun.  Recommended a fantastic beer to pair with my lobster roll   I really enjoy this place"}
{"text":"Was hoping it would be crowded on a Tuesday evening but we were the only table. The restaurant is clean and the servers were nice. I only came down for the $13 lobster tail caesar. Very yum!"}
{"text":"lobster is okay, not as fresh as i expected and the portion size is quite small ! Caesar is decent tho.   We had a birthday party here (~18 people) large group ( greater than 8) is 18% auto-gratitude. Too Dark for dining, noisy level was alright, you can have conversation without yelling at each other. lol"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time after hearing my friend rave about how good it was and surely I was not disappointed:  - the staff is extremely attentive, the waiter checked on us regularly or would at least look at our table to make sure everything was perfect.  - the food was extremely worth the price, the amounts of lobster are generous, I had the lobster poutine and the rock burger she had the lobster macaroni and cheese  - after being lost in deep conversation I suddenly noticed that we were the only customers left in the restaurant, i looked at my watch and noticed we were there 10 minutes past closing, not once did the staff mention it to us rudely or threaten to kick us out, they simply let us sit there and talk, after having addressed it with the waiter he assured us that we can take our time and that they will just close once we leave!  If I could give this place 6/5 stars I would, one of the best places I have ever been to in terms of service and the food was definitely above what I was expecting.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We came on at around 5 pm on a Friday night and it was rather empty. Got seated right away - server was helpful in helping us with our orders. The food was better than average, but was on the pricier side. Portions were kind of small, me and my friend ordered three dishes and ended up finishing all of it, and we don't eat that much compared to an average person. We ordered the lobster roll, jerk shrimp roll and lobster mac and cheese. Food came rather quickly, maybe cos it wasn't busy at that time. Lobster roll was fantastic, too bad the roll was tiny. Jerk shrimp has a pungent taste which was too much in my opinion, but my friend liked it. It's also quite spicy so if you can't take spicy food you might want to stay away from it. The Mac and cheese was average, as expected there wasn't much lobster in it, and it was basically submerged in melted cheese, which was too much for me. All in all, I enjoyed my experience there, and would definitely come back to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriend after a workout class, was feeling hungry and I was very excited to try this place after I've heard so much hype. The crowd is a mature crowd. The menu was very limited, not a bit selection. We decided to share the lobster mac and cheese and the lobster roll. For me, I feel like the food could be much better especially for the price paid. The mac and cheese did not have much lobster in it. (not that I expected there to be giant chunks but a good lobster flavour that could be tasted in the mac was what I was hoping for). The lobster roll was small and not mind blowing (I don't like cold foods+it reminded me of other lobster rolls I've had). I wish it came with fries then chips.   Overall, sharing the meal it was not very filling. I did however like the service and the fact that we had the option for the bill to be split in the middle. I find a lot of restaurants don't offer this and this causes some awkwardness in sharing foods/paying the bill. I would recommend coming here when they have specials to try but not a regular place to dine at."}
{"text":"Portions aren't huge but the lobster goodness is pretty awesome.  For less than $15 it's pretty tough to get lobster anywhere in this City albeit it's not full pound lobster.   There's even beers on taps which I usually get Amsterdam Blonde or if you really want to ball out you can get the Cesar with Lobster tail, first place I've ever seen this!  As well it's right in the heart of the Ossington strip, you can put your name down for Bellwoods next door and by the time you're done dinner you can get a bench seat for some great beer there too."}
{"text":"A friend of a friend recommended this place. It took me less than a heart beat second to decide on a visit here a few days later. Lobster + poutine, you had me at \"L\"  So the little cute shop is tucked in on queen/ossington corner. The store front is so small I had to really look for it. I think it used to be a bank of Montreal location - they have a sign at the front which i thought was pretty cool.   The place was packed - ofcourse. but wait wasn't long, maybe 10 in or so. We got a lil cute intimate table at the back of the restaurant. I got a cider and hubby got something on tab - and we got lobster poutine and steak tartare.   The entire experience was awesome. The poutine had a decent amount of pink lobster goodness on top of your cheese and gravy and fries heaven. I coulda eaten 5 of those myself. The steak tartare was okay - it came with some lobster and fried potato chips. But i was comparing it to the steak tartare i had in paris... and lets just say this was not Paris.   Decent food, nice romantic atmosphere. I would definitely come back and try other things on the menu. (on the side note: is there like a secret menu? because there's only a handful of things on the printed version, I can see more variety of food just by looking around. I feel a little bit left out)  will come again, will do a bit more research on the menu also. mm-mmm good"}
{"text":"So good! We sat at the bar and the guys working there were super friendly and helpful, they taught the person I was with how to eat crab legs and oysters! I got the beet salad which was amazing, so much food and great flavors. Great service and great food! I will be back."}
{"text":"We ordered the Jerk shimp and crab legs, Lobster poutine and Lobster Mac & cheese  The lobster poutine tasted good but there wasn't much lobster The lobster mac and cheese tasted bland but there wasn't much lobster The jerk shrimp & crab legs tasted good but I recognized the Jerk flavour because I've got it at home...  Home. Home?   I don't go out to eat food that tastes like crap I can make at home.  That's my cardinal rule.  That's why I don't eat at subway--i can make a sandwich at home.  I don't even buy pasta dishes for this reason but I went in on the Lobster mac and cheese for the lobster that was barely even there.... sigh.  How is it $20 for each dish when there wasn''t much lobster?  Anyway, the customer service was great. The guy with the ponytail was very helpful.  I kept mistaking him for the other guy w the pony tail.  4 stars"}
{"text":"The restaurant is only getting a one star since I cant give it none. And I guess the service was ok enough to get the 1 star. Also very expensive for the quality/portion.  If you are going for the food, then by all ways avoid this restaurant. We had the lobster rolls and the lobster poutine fries. The portion is very small for the lobster roll, the lobster was flavourless, and the chips that came with their famous lobster roll were uneatable. They were soaked in oil, almost burned and the oil the chips were fried in was apparently over used.   Their poutine fries was ok, lacked of salt though.   In short NOT WORTH GOING BACK TO."}
{"text":"This restaurant is so overrated. The only good thing in my whole meal was the bun. The lobster roll tastes like they bought McLobster from McD and put in their bun. I never tried the McLobster but I think that is the taste. The lobster poutine was tasteless and the lobster looks and tastes like fake crab meat."}
{"text":"Very legit spot to eat if you've got the seafood bug that night.   I gave this spot a 4 star based on the food. The staff should get a 5 star rating for the excellent an friendly service they provide!  Got the special for $25 (lobster diner original price of $39) shared some oysters, crab legs and the lobster poutine(not to be missed) w 2 other ppl.   Everything was delicious and the whole experience was good. I will be returning when I got the seafood cravings!"}
{"text":"I love Rock Lobster. From the moment you walk in, all the servers and bartenders, everyone is so friendly and makes you feel welcome. The lobster caesar is an amazing drink, and the food is delicious. I recommend the lobster roll, the lobster poutine and the lobster caesar. You can't go wrong with the lobster. Oh! And ask for the biscuits. They aren't always on the menu, but they are delicious, with cheddar and butter. Yum."}
{"text":"Great Oysters, awesome Caesar cocktail, comes with a bug lobster tail, nice environment, modern but cozy and relaxed. Service was ok, and their food is great too. I had the mussels, they were good! Nice place to go to meet new people or hang out with friends."}
{"text":"We came in on a saturday night over the holidays. We arrived at 6:45pm and we were seated promptly. The ambience was cozy (who doesn't like to crack lobster by candlelight). We had the lobster poutine, lobster mac and cheese, the crab and beer bucket and lobster roll.   The lobster poutine and mac and cheese were superb. I personally am not into either of these dishes but my girlfriend was recently released from poutine rehab and she said it was amazing.   I had the crab and beer bucket, for $30 it was the best deal in town. The bucket was literally filled with crab, it took me about two hours to finish the entire thing.   I forgot to mention they also have a good selection of beers on tap served in mason jars (release your inner hipster).   All in all the meal cost about $120, 4 pints, 1 ceasar all the above food and of course the smile from the waitress was free."}
{"text":"Went to the new location on Queen West last night.  Most horrific service I've had in a very long time.  Waited over 45 minutes to get in, even though we were told it would be about 10 mins.  Then we were taken to a table on the patio.  I'm a big fan of patios, but I've never been given a patio seat without being asked if I want one.  And if I had wanted one, I would have dressed more warmly.  The food is ok, but it's not good enough that you put up with bad service. Also they serve food as it is ready - so don't expect to necessarily be eating at the same time as the rest of your table. They certainly don't time that out."}
{"text":"Arrrr! Who'd knew lobster can work well in a poutine? It is a salivating buttery combination that will make your heart melt.  The lobster taco ($5 each) comes fresh and comes packing with meaty and juicy flavours. And their lobster caesar will knock your socks off laughing. You can stick a tail into that!   Overall, a decent rockin' hip place to enjoy lobster in trendy food, over fun drinks and great service. Arrrrr! (The folks over at the Queen location are much more awesomer, but that's a different story.)"}
{"text":"if you are a fan of lobster this is a great place. We had a opening special for $25 for whole lobster platter (comes with mashed potatoes and creamed spinach). However, they could be a bit inventive on their sides. Their whole menu could be better. A bit better than Red Lobster."}
{"text":"A bit disappointed by Rock Lobster... sorry.   I got the Oysters and I guess for the quality it was pretty good and fresh. However, it seemed a bit over priced.  The ambiance is also very lively, just like the rest of the Ossington Strip. The restaurant itself is pretty dark which is a good and bad thing...   The worst part was the servers.. I'm a server myself so I know that the service was terrible. Like another previous review from Jennifer P., there were too many servers, hostesses,and food runners. Everybody seemed everywhere and it seemed pretty disorganized. Our server was quite fun, however she paid us no attention until we asked for the bill...   To be honest, I wouldn't go back to this rock lobster. But I have hopes for the other Rock Lobsters. I'm definitely interested to try the one on Queen and the new one by Leslieville soooo fingers crossed!"}
{"text":"Overpriced, over cooked.  The menu looks good but the food is unimpressive.  3 Tiny over cooked shrimps for 6$. Simple grilled vegetable salad was 14$ Burger bun was cold, meat under seasoned.  Fish taco was alright, nothing special. Good music, nice crowd, nice wait staff.  Service was very slow."}
{"text":"Want lobster, but don't want to go through the mess of buying one, steaming it, cleaning it, and taking out all the lobster meat piece by piece, then rock lobster is for you!  They put fresh lobster on poutine, tacos, rolls, mac n cheese, etc. All perfectly prepared. Want just a lobster? They do that as well.  Also, when we went, they had a lobsterlicious menu where you can get an app, main, and desert for 25 bucks!  Also, they usually have daily deals as well. taco tuesday, whole lobster sunday, etc.   Don't forget to addon a lobster caesar as well. The only drink you will have with a lobster tail sticking out of it.   Lobster not your thing? Don't worry they have alternative options like crab! They also have seafood plates, soups, etc. But if you are coming to a lobster place, get the lobster!  We ended the night with the Whale Tale. Kinda like a beaver tail, funnel cake, deep fried dough. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food and great drinks. Girlfriend and I went in there for dinner on recent vacation. We were seated at the bar by ourselves and got the full treatment being the only ones there.   We had drinks ready whenever they were empty and got quick and great food from the kitchen. Awesome lobster roll and clam rolls. And to start we shared the lobster poutine. While the lobster was great, the gravy and cheese curds made the whole dish awesome. Definitely wish there were more places to get some lobster poutine in the U.S.!"}
{"text":"Finally revisited Rock Lobster yesterday for dinner.  Service was great. Since it was a Monday, it wasn't busy, so that was as nice bonus. The Rock Lobster Caesar is great ! comes garnished with a lobster tail and rimmed with steak spice. We got the three cheese lobster dip, which was super duper cheesy and delicious! The chips that come with it are amazing. We also got lobster mac n cheese, which was good, but nothing to boost about - could've used more flavour. We also had fresh oysters which were REALLY fresh and also broiled crab. This place falls under the seafood category, so prices match that of other seafood establishments. Great place for lobster dishes."}
{"text":"I came here and had the Lobster Rolls.  They were okay.  The first bite was great but as I continued into it I noticed the lobster was very chewy/rubbery and the entire thing seemed to be dripping in butter. A very insane amount of butter. It quickly turned a great piece of bread into a soggy mess.  I also got a piece of shell jammed between my teeth.  The fries were good and the atmosphere of the place was nice."}
{"text":"Always a good time! :) lobster Caesars are the bomb!! Get here early if you want a seat at the bar :)"}
{"text":"TIP: Come on a Sunday.  Their Lobster Supper (normally $39) is only $25, and boy is it satisfying and good!  I brought my parents here during their visit to Toronto.  They're used to low-quality American seafood chains, like Red Lobster.  This was a big step.  We generally enjoyed our experience, but there were a few issues:  The FOOD: First, off the lobster supper rocks.  It is a large whole lobster + mashed potatoes + creamed spinach + bread.  At the $25 special, it's a great deal.  The only issue was that they serve the lobster 100% whole too hot to handle.  We had to send it back to get them to slice it in half and provide some instruction to us newbies.    We also had the  --Lobster Mac & Cheese ($14): incredibly rich, a definite hit --Lobster cappuccino ($6): hmm...not sure what they were going for here.  Not much lobster involved.  Suggestion for 2: Order the lobster dinner + one other dish & share.  The DRINKS: We went for wines over cocktails.  It turned out they were having lots of issues with their on-tap wines.  This really delayed things (we're talking 30+ minutes), and they didn't really offer a very good substitute.  They managed to rustle up some alternative bottles, but didn't offer us the lower prices.  As much trouble as we had here, I honestly might have expected some sort of comp.  I saw the lobster caesar...kind of not my thing.  I like caesars, I like lobster tails, but I'm not sure it enhances either to combine the two...weird.  The SERVICE: Our server was friendly, but rather harried.  I wouldn't call the service good, nor bad.  We definitely were ignored for quite a while, and there could have been a lot better service with the wine issues.    OVERALL, I think this is a great place to come for the lobster supper on a Sunday.  I don't think I would pay that much any other day.  The food was quite tasty, but there were definitely a few kinks that kept it away from the 5-star mark."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to eat here with high expectations because lobster...and poutine how can one not be ecstatic over that godly combination?! My friend ordered the lobster mac and cheese, it was good! However it's one of those type of food that will taste too overdone if you consume too much of it. My other girl friend tried the jerk crab and shrimp but she was unable to eat it because she was simply too lazy to crack the shells open LOL but yeah I tried some and it was good! The place is okay, I think i'll visit it once in a while."}
{"text":"I am a little spoiled. I went to Maine in October and we had spectacular lobster there at cheap prices. I was looking forward to this to relive my experience.   The GOOD, Wine on tap? $1 an oz. I liked the music selection although a bit too loud you had to yell to talk so the couple next to us could hear our whole convo. The staff were great! The service was quick and very knowledgeable. Really took care of us. They have a cold and raw bar and the cocktails are amazing!!  The MEH,  We ordered the beet salad, it was fresh and small. Beautiful presentation but lacked flavour.  Lobster Poutine... very mediocre. The fries were unsalted, the dish was cold, small and hardly had any cheese, gravy or lobster? Bland  Lobster Mac and Cheese, Came in a \"small\" cast iron pan. It was dry and bland as well. I feel like they didn't season anything.   We didn't bother with desert after seeing our neighbours the table beside us, who also looked unimpressed.  I actually felt hungry when I left.   So I would go back to eat oysters and have a ceasar at the bar. But I will wait until they improve the menu."}
{"text":"Quality of the food was underwhelming. Our chips were soggy and my lobster roll was heavy in mayo.  The atmosphere was noisy with loud music, not the most relaxing place. I had better lobster rolls at lobster box. I had great oysters which is why I am still giving it a 3."}
{"text":"This is a casual busy place, tables are kind of close together and small, not a place to come for a relaxing romantic dinner or anything. Service was pretty good although they were slow with bringing the bill, then the credit card machine, etc. Really good food though and it came out quick! Had the caesars, which come with a lobster tail and rimmed with Montreal steak spice sooo delish. Also shared a seafood chowder and a lobster poutine. Lots of seafood in both of these and big portions, more than enough to share. Great hangover remedy!!"}
{"text":"Came here with a few friends after wandering the area looking for restaurants to try out. We each ordered a lobster roll and also ordered the fried clams and buffalo shrimp. While I found the fried clams to be a bit on the salty side, the lobster roll and buffalo shrimp were really good! They didn't skimp out on the lobster for the roll, and the Yukon chips exceeded my expectations. The music was a bit on the loud side, so I noticed that I had to raise my voice a bit during conversation, but it wasn't a big deal. I really liked how the chef came out to greet each of the tables to see if we found everything alright."}
{"text":"We went to Rock Lobster (Ossington) last night and I LOVED IT!  We arrived at 5 pm to avoid any crowds (as it's a smaller place and it was pretty busy by 6 pm) and because we have a young child.  We were seated right away in a great spot.  For dinner, I had the $25 Lobster Sunday special (SOOOO good), my husband had the Fish & Chips with a lobster tail on the side (also awesome!) and our son had the kids lobster sandwich.  I was impressed they have a kids menu and colouring too.  The atmosphere was really great and I actually recognized all the songs (it was like a soundtrack for those who are almost 40!).  The volume of the music was perfect (I remember reading in a previous review that it was too loud).  Super friendly service too.  I recommend this place 100%!"}
{"text":"The interior was surprisingly spacious, which was unexpected when looking in from the outside.  It was slightly dimly lit for my taste, but that was minor.  Waitress was friendly and seemed to know the menu fairly well.    Foodwise, I was a little disappointed.  To start, the lobster cappuccino was served with a giant dollop, excessive if you ask me, of cr√®me fra√Æche.  As a soup, I would expect it to be served hot, but instead it was lukewarm at best.   A staple for any good lobster joint has to be their lobster roll.  The bun was well toasted and easy to handle; however, the filling was under-seasoned.  The surf and turf tartare was pretty solid, but it would have been perfect if they kicked up the mustard/horseradish amount a bit more.  Both the lobster roll and the tartare dish were both served with a giant mound of homemade chips.  The chips were the worst part as they were cold, seemed stale and tasteless."}
{"text":"This review is only for the drinks I had on a Saturday evening out on the patio.  We arrived (a tired group of us) seeking refuge from walking around the city..needing to quench our thirst... OKAY not so dramatic.  We stopped in for a drink, decided to check out the patio out back (which was really nice and quiet). I ordered the Rock Lobster Caesar... and I would say that I REALLY enjoyed it.   Even though you could BARELY taste the alcohol and would ask yourself whether they put any in it at all... it had a sweet spicy kick to it.. and the half lobster tail was nice to munch on.   I gotta try the actual food here sometime, because these reviews are all over the map. It's hard to tell what is up with this place!"}
{"text":"I went here yesterday with a friend to have lunch and drinks on their patio. I had a lobster roll, a caesar (with lobster tail), a slushie tequila cocktail, plus we shared devilled eggs.  The lobster roll was a tasty bit of comfort food, and I enjoyed the home made chips. The devilled eggs were quite disappointing. They didn't taste bad or anything, but they were bland and lacked any particular flavour. At the high price of $7 for two eggs, I expected much better than this. The price of $7 for two devilled eggs is pretty outrageous in any case. The caesar was also average at best. The lobster tail that came with the caesar was nice and refreshing, but the caesar was also bland, and nothing really made it stand out (except for the lobster tail). This seems to be their flagship cocktail, so it really should taste a lot better than it does.  The slushie tequila cocktail was good. I would order it again.   I tried some of my friend's meal who had scallops and a fish sandwich. The scallops had a nice texture (I usually don't like scallops because I find them to be too rubbery), and the fish sandwich was tasty, and worth the price at $5.  The bill came in with tax and tip at just over $55. Although this isn't an unreasonable price for lunch and cocktails, I couldn't help but thinking that if I'm going to spend $55 on lunch, it's not going to be at a place like this. While the food at Rock Lobster is \"good\" in some cases (bland in others), the food is pretty much fast food, is grubby, and doesn't really warrant the price tag. I would come back here for the $5 fish sandwich, but mostly everything else on the menu is quite a bit over priced for what they have on offer.   I have to say that the decor is nice, and they have an amazing patio, but overall, I have to say that I was disappointed with the lunch here."}
{"text":"Came to this location for the first time sometime in July 2015 for my mom's birthday. We had made reservations at the Leslieville location (which I had been to many times), unfortunately it was storming out and a patio umbrella was swept up by the wind and knocked down their power supply. So after being told we could not order any food (and receiving zero compensation for the drinks we had already ordered) we had to switch locations. We called the Queen West location and told them what had happened and not only did this girl have poor phone etiquette, but she also said they would not reserve a table for us as we only had 3 people....however when our waitress was kind enough to call Ossington they were very understanding and had our table ready when we arrived. The server at Ossington was super sweet and he was great with my 1 year old niece who was infatuated with him.  The food is delicious! Lobster Mac & Cheese is great, as well as the Lobster Poutine. The Maine Roll is my absolute favourite though, there is sooo much lobster and it is just delicious. The french fries are also a hit on their own. The Lobster dip was really good too, a bit too much fennel for my taste though. Not sure if they sell it anymore as it is not on their online menu.  I am not a Caesar fan but my mom and sister both loved theirs, which is to be expected as they have been winning best Caesar in Toronto for a few years.  Food has always been a solid 10/10.  Service at THIS location was superb, but I was really disappointed with Queen West and Leslieville."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night and it was very busy.  We waited 45 minutes for a table, and were seated in the most awkward spot: between the bar and the stairs going down to the bathroom. If you've seen this place, you will know just how small that space is.  Of course there were people going in and out of the restaurant to smoke and busy waitresses going by!  Anyway we ordered the lobster poutine, mac n' cheese, and ceviche. The first two dishes were \"okay\". Nothing special. No effort into the presentation; cooked regularly with bland lobster strewn on top. The ceviche was delicious though; very fresh tasting and had a great balance of lemon and cilantro."}
{"text":"Ossington is full of gems, and I heard Rock Lobster Food Co was one of them so I went to try.  Well, it was alright.  Surf & Turf Steak Tartare + Lobster Poutine: Guess I might just not be a fan of the Yukon hand-cut fries in the poutine, but the dish was barely saved by the cheese and the lobster bisque.  It was alright.. Suft & turf is usually a safe bet but the steak tartare lacked flavour and I enjoyed the dish mostly because I was hungry before eating.  Oh, oysters were incredibly fresh though - definitely recommend :)  $2.25/each, a bit on the pricey side but worth it."}
{"text":"Came here on a recommendation from a friend. I ordered the lobster roll w/ chips and my fianc√© had the lobster mac 'n cheese. We also tried a few oysters each, a first for both of us. My lobster roll was decent. Maybe I shouldn't compare to my experiences in Boston, but I didn't think it was anything special. More than half of the chips it came with were burnt and inedible, maybe the oil wasn't fresh as they didn't taste very good. I didn't care much to even have them, just saying. My fianc√©'s meal was even more disappointing, as it came sans lobster. Maybe it was a really bad off day or maybe it was the staff that seemed much more interested with socializing with one another that the quality went out the window.   On a positive note, we discovered that we really like oysters."}
{"text":"What can you give to the man or woman who has everything?  A dinner at Rock Lobster, that's what. The lobster tail Caesar is impressive and I personally loved the steak tartare garnished with lobster meat. The crispy home-style chips taste like salted addiction incarnate. Bathrooms are teeny but well-lit and clean (once you make it down the ubiquitous narrow downtown Toronto basement stairs."}
{"text":"Choose your meal items wisely. I've been to this location 3 times and the one on Queen once.  We had a team building event late Sunday afternoon for 9 people at this location and were seated right away.  Ordered a caesar, lobster mac n' cheese and a fish taco.    Caesar was decent and the lobster tail skewer was a nice touch.   Lobster mac n' cheese had just enough sauce and a crisp top.  The lighting was very dim so it was hard to see how much lobster was in the mix but I could definitely taste it.   Fish taco would have been perfect but they only used one tortilla so it literally crumbled in my hand forcing me to finish with a fork.  Great combo of crispy and crunchy.  Service was accommodating and even if they didn't have a solution to issues like dim lighting we felt like they made an effort.  Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"We had supper last tonight at Rock Lobster.  Gord had had their lobster mac 'n cheese in the summer and liked it and wanted to try their lobster roll.  Gord ordered their Rock Lobster Roll.  He said it was okay ... a bit small.  I'm not a fan of seafood and ordered one of the two non-seafood dishes on the menu ... a burger (without lettuce and cheese) and fries.  The burger was small ... a bit bigger than a slider.  The fries were delicious.  The burger was overdone and a bit dry."}
{"text":"It was pleasantly fast to take the TTC street car west & south one stop south on Ossington. Pretty busy as it was a Saturday night but they did not have problems finding a table for two :)   We ordered the ...  Lobster roll $15 - I was super hungry & had lunch 8 hrs prior. So it tasted extra good. I thought the size was right for me. But likely not enough for guys.  Lobster Chower $13 - The soup wasn't thick at all. A bit too watered down imho. However, it had a lot of ingredients. But I really wish this was thicker to give it that richer taste. After all, what a price for a soup!   Service was excellent & everything came very quickly! We were likely done eating in 30 mins. Would love to come back again !"}
{"text":"Finally, a crustacean restaurant that i can call home. The food is excellent i(f you like seafood of course) Oysters, crab legs, shrimp and Lobster. There is a steak frite with duck eggs if you have to. The menu is pretty interesting, with the tower (platter) options, whole lobsters, lobster rolls, but the things that i enjoyed the most were the steak and lobster tartare, the lobster bisque cappucinno, and the lobster ceaser.  The place is very decently priced and the owner/chef matt is a very friendly person. his warmth resonates in the style of the restaurant. he brings in his lobsters fresh daily which is a feat during the winter.  Definitely adding this place to my list of regular restaurants. I'm sick of paying high prices at the lobster trap for bad service, and waiting for the keg to do lobster summer.  I've always wanted an all year lobster restaurant that didn't rip people off and this place i the answer to that prayer."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: 8/10 Service: 8.5/10  The servers were friendly and cheerful.  Do - order the lobster mac and cheeses - creamy and delicious.  Do - order the lobster rolls. Simple and flavourful.  Do - Make sure you get at least one of them: Lobster taco. It's small, but really good. I could easily swallow like 5 in 2 mins. This is a must have. You can't go to Rock Lobster and not have the taco. People will judge you if you don't. Plus you need something to 'talk' about after. Eat. The.Taco.  The potato chips they serve with all the dishes are, well, not so good. They taste cheap and some were burnt but that is not to take away from the food.  They could work on their portions. overall, good place."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars  VIBE  It's really exciting to see another pop up success story! I think Rock Lobster perfectly fits the atmosphere of Ossington in Watusi's old space and will bring the hipsters and foodies in droves. The murals are \"instagram\" worthy decorated by owner Matt Petit himself and the seating works as a place where you can chill out.   That said, the music is LOUD. Like Rock N' Roll, Bruce Springsteen loud so sometimes you can't hear your campanion.  Service is A Plus -- even when it's busy everyone from the owner to the waitstaff are making sure you're taken care of.   WE ATE  I was lucky to be at a media event and get a sampling of everything. The lobster rolls here are classic but the additions are also really exciting (and no, it's not all lobster!).  I loved the seafood platter with oysters, shrimp and lobster--it gets a bit messy but it's fun. The flank steak with hickory sticks and egg added with sailor jerry rum sauce was a big hit with our table as well and gives a more casual vibe to the whole \"surf and turf mentality.\" It was nice to see something healthy on the menu as well like the beet salad and that gave the meal a bit of balance as well. The Cripsy Maple Pork belly with creamed spinach and micro greens was YUM! Nicely executed and presented.   Misses: the lobster poutine - I like my cheese more gooey and less curdy; the Caesar salad; the rolls are great but a bit mayo heavy --the pickle really cuts through that though (and the pickles are BIG so that's a hit not a miss!). I'm not as much of a fan of the whale tail either --I like the Canadiana effort but it would be cool to see a more inventive dessert that's easy to eat (kind of like Grand Electric's key lime vassos) but doesn't break the bank (like under the $5-6 mark).   DRINK: Rock Lobster has teamed up with Sailor Jerry spiced rum to deliver some kick a** drinks by superstar bartender Josh Lindley. Though I didn't have it, his caesar with a lobster tail seems to have everyone talking; My favourite drink was the Norman Collins -- Sailor Jerry with lime juice and elderflower. It's simple and packs a punch. If you're a fan of campari, you'll like the Barel Aged Flying Colours drink: rum with campari, cherry heering and peychaud bitters aged in a tequila barrel for 30 days. If you're not a fan of campari, you'll take one sip and move on to the Norman Collins. It's a VERY strong drink!   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  Rock on! We were here on a Wednesday and it felt like a jam packed Saturday. A new place for Ossington to call their own."}
{"text":"I came here after seeing all the hype about this place. Luckily it was a weekday so we didn't have to wait long. The food was alright but I might also be bias because I love lobster. We ordered the Mac and cheese, lobster sandwich, lobster poutine and scallops. The best was the lobster sandwich but the Mac and cheese was not any different than any other mac and cheese.   The service was also on the slow side so although the food was not bad i didn't think that it was worth the hype."}
{"text":"I had been curious about Rock Lobster for a very long time, but was very apprehensive about dining at one of their establishments because the reviews were all over the place-most being quite negative. So when I saw that they were participating in Summerlicious, I was shocked, and stoked because I would get to try the food for a good price. For $25 you got to choose one appetizer, one main and one dessert from several options. So I gave them a call and made a reservation for 12 people. They had two sitting times (6pm and 8pm), I went with 6pm. Here is what I ordered:  Lobster taco: Not good. The tortilla was cold and hard, and as a result, one could not appreciate, or taste for that matter, the lobster. Such a shame. Lobster is too delicate to pair with a tortilla, specially a cold and hard one at that! I wish I hard ordered the deviled eggs or beet salad. Those two appetizers looked delicious, and those who ordered them, liked them.  Lobster roll: I really liked the lobster roll. The bread was warm, buttery, and soft. A perfect pairing with the creamy pieces of lobster. The chips I could have done without. They tasted burnt and bitter, and some had too much salt on them (the chips were seasoned after they were plated perhaps?)  Dessert: I ordered the daily future which on that evening was a huge chocolate chip cookie sandwich. And damn, it was SWEET! Too sweet. I was only able to have 2 bites (inside the cookie there was another cookie-a Oreo cookie!). Talk about sugar overload. Though I probably would have finished it if I had a glass of milk. Maybe sell this cookie with a glass of milk? Now that is an idea! In terms of the other desserts, people were put off by the deconstructed feel of them and the taste was nothing to rave about.  The consensus was that if we had to rate our dinner out of 10, we would give it a 6/10. The dishes were a hit or miss, and although we loved some dishes, others completely missed the mark. I am really glad I got to experience dinner at Rock Lobster during Summerlicious because there is no way that I would pay the regular price for any of these items.  WAIT! Now that I think about it, $25 was not much of a deal since the dessert would have been $6, the lobster roll $14 and the lobster taco $5. Argh, I got gypped! Sigh."}
{"text":"I was really excited to go to diner here last night, I'd heard great things and I love sea food. Long story short, I was very disappointed. The atmosphere was cool, the server was friendly and quick and I liked their music volume and song selection. That was the good part. My date I and ordered the Caesar that comes with a \"lobster tail\". It was a half lobster tail that wasn't very fresh. The Caesar itself was watery and bland. For food we ordered oysters, surf and turf tar tar, pork belly and the lobster roll. The food came fast, like impossibly fast. The steak and lobster tar tar came out literally in under 5 minutes of us ordering it. The tar tar wasn't bad, even though I think they've just got a big bowl of it sitting in the fridge all night. The homemade chips that came with every course were cold and chewey, again I think they've just got a big bowl of them sitting back there all night. The pork belly was spot on, cooked perfectly and very tasty. The lobster roll was okay but didn't knock me down. The oysters came out last which doesn't make any sense and they were just okay. All in all it was not a good experience, there seemed to be not a lot of effort put into the food and that's a very bad sign for a restaurant so new. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Perhaps my hopes were a bit too high, but I have to admit I'm slightly disappointed by my Rock Lobster trip!   I've been eying this place for some time, and as I'm moving out of the neighborhood soon i figured it was the perfect time to give Rock Lobster a try!  I love the feel of the place, it has a bit of nautical decor which isn't too over the top. There is a good amount of seating too - on my random Wednesday lobster date, they were able to get a table for 8 of us no problem. The servers were friendly and offered us drinks while we waited for the rest of our party to show up. A very good first impression!   DRINKS - They have a great drink list with a LOBSTER DRINK - the Rock Lobster Caesar (featuring a lobster tail!) yum! They also have wine on tap at $1/oz, so basically the drink list had me hooked.   FOOD - the menu looked good, with a few pricy options and a few $12-$15 options. There are also quite a few delicious appetizers, we went for both some oysters (east coast, hurrah!) and a lobster tail. For mains, I ordered the steak and lobster tartar, and the lobster mac and cheese, with the idea that we would split the two. The mains were delicious, but I could definitely have gone for a third choice as well for the two people! The steak tartar was smaller than I anticipated, and while the mac and cheese was a good size, it wasn't quite enough food for two.   So overall, I wish there was more on the menu, or that it was more clear to me that I should order more than one dish per person, perhaps a few to share. When I go again (I'm a firm believer of second chances) I will split one of the towers (which looked UNREAL) or get the lobster dinner for myself. It really is just that I was hoping to go and get a lobster, and instead ended up with a bunch of other food that was kind of lobster-y, without being real lobster.   So, worth going to, definitely! But is it the place to go and get/eat a lobster? Surprisingly, maybe not."}
{"text":"It's not Red Lobster, it's Rock Lobster. The name alone makes me want to dance (B-52's, anyone?) add drawn butter into the equation and you've got one happy tourist!  Though there was a wait to be seated at a booth, +1 and I opted to sit in the window with one long tall table and stools. Made for fun people watching, especially those who tried to enter the restaurant from the wrong door. We'd simply make eye contact, point them in the right direction and have a laugh together. Better than most reality TV these days...  Love wine served by the oz! That alone deserves 4-stars. After a few glasses of red, chilly temps were the last thing on my mind. Paired nicely with lobster poutine and the Crow's Nest: a combination of shrimp, oysters, and crab legs. YUM!   The rest of my evening in Ossington is a bit fuzzy (see the above paragraph, mentioning wine by the oz), but Rock Lobster was the perfect way to start a Saturday night in Toronto."}
{"text":"Had the rock lobster roll, delicious but tiny! Comes with some ....chips ?   Thank god Ha had the lobster Mac n Cheese, which I ate half of. It was great but I'm lactose intolerant so yet to be determined if it was worth the risk. So far....yes.  However I'm still hungry so we'll see what else I put in myself tonight before calling that one.   Overall pretty good. Music is way too loud for conversation, but then again it's full of customers who are all talking about Pabst, beards, tats, music they think no one knows but them and new places to drink that are over priced, so I'm sure most can nod their head in agreement at any point of the conversation and fit in just fine.   7/10"}
{"text":"It's never a good idea when Poutine Week launches at the same time as my supposed week of detox.  I had to give in.  We checked out Rock Lobster for their lobster poutine special ($10).  Arrived around 7:30pm and was seated right away.  We ordered a few glasses of the house red wine which at $1/oz was a bargain!  Poutines came to the table quickly - generous amount of lobster meat but fries could have been crispier and gravy could have been hotter.  Still that didn't deter me from shoveling it into my face.  A pretty great poutine over all!  Will be back for a proper dinner in the near future, and will definitely order the poutine as a starter!"}
{"text":"I decided to check out this place after a friend raved about their lobster roll (I had also seen the owner do a cooking demo at CNE - he's legit). I really liked it!   What I ate: Lobster roll, lobster taco and lobster poutine.  LOBSTER ROLL comes with a side of kettle chips and a dill pickle. Very light and fresh tasting! I usually don't like lobster rolls because they're too heavy on the sauce but this was just right.  The LOBSTER TACO was the best! And this is coming from someone who's eaten a lot of tacos. The corn made it very fresh and sweet tasting. Although, it was the smallest taco I've ever seen before. Wish I ordered more.  LOBSTER POUTINE was good as well. The gravy is lighter than traditional poutine gravy which I really liked. I find that the taste of the lobster gets lost in the fries, cheese and gravy eventually though. Wouldn't order this again.  The prices are really good for seafood but the portions are a bit on the smaller side (A.K.A don't come here starving unless you're willing to dish out the money). I shared this with another person and we were both satisfied by the end of dinner. They also offer non-seafood options as well.  Overall, I really enjoyed the food here. I will definitely come back again for more lobster tacos. Also saw their Sunday $25 on a lobster meal. Would love to try that next time."}
{"text":"Despite the mixed reviews of this place I decided to risk it and give their lobster roll a shot. I've only ever had one lobster roll in my life previous to my visit at Rock Lobster and wanted to compare. Here's what I can say about the lobster roll, it wasn't anything special and in fact I found the pickle that comes on the side more delicious. The majority of the accompanying chips it came with were burnt. That's something I'd expect from a fast food place, not a restaurant. I also ordered the lobster poutine which I can only describe as being a joke. It had no flavor whatsoever, on a flavor scale it's comparable to water."}
{"text":"Despite an unpleasant experience at the Queen Street Rock Lobster, I was willing to give this location a shot due to my new quest to find the best lobster roll in Toronto.  SERVICE:   Right off the bat, the fine service at this location already made this a better experience than the last time - we were seated quickly, the server was quick to take our order and fill our request (e.g. for an extra spoon), and the food arrived much faster then expected.  FOOD:  Came here specifically for the Lobster Roll. As per other reviews, the roll was a bit smaller than I would have liked, and also somewhat on the soggy side. The contrast of the warm buttered bread with the chilled meat also felt odd at first, but as the roll was overall quite tasty nonetheless. The seemingly home-made chips that accompanied the roll were too salty for my taste, but added some nice crunch to the meal (along with the pickle).   After hearing good things about the Lobster chowder, I also had to try it. Though quite pricey for a soup ($13!), and a bit more watery than expected for a chowder, there was plenty of chunks of lobster, potato, celery, ham etc. to liven it up.   ATMOSPHERE:  While a bit cramped, the restaurant did very well in terms of maximizing its seating capacity. There's definitely a certain aura here that makes it a comfortable spot for a dinner or late night drinks. There's also a couple TV's near the small but serviceable bar.   SUMMARY:  Surprisingly prompt service given how busy it is. Lobster roll and chowder were good, but not fantastic - a decent place to grab some seafood and drinks with friends on a weekend."}
{"text":"As a primarily vegetarian vegan (for ethical but also health reasons) I normally wouldn't eat here, but once or twice a year I have a  craving for seafood and the jerk crab I tried here will keep me coming back! It's served with shrimp but I usually feed those to a friend! This dish is to die for!! I love Spicy flavorful food and the price is amazing too!  The Caesar drink is the best I've ever had anywhere! As for the wine sold by the oz-I found that very misleading on my first visit  $18 a glass?? Woah!!! And they said it was 9oz but neither my friends nor I thought it even looked like 6! Anyhow having said that ~ I will return because when that crustacean craving hits - this place will satisfy it!! The music is great (I enjoy loud-Ish Rock music, modern and classics) fun atmosphere too! It's a pity you can't reserve ahead of time (due to the small busy venue I guess) so make sure to show up in advance (not too hungry) and leave your number- then go for a little walk up the street - or wait at the bar if there's room! Servers and bartenders were friendly and I rather like the informal atmosphere and affordable food and Caesar garnished with a lobster tail! Poor crustaceans... They do feel pain you know!! It's just hard to give it all up for good.. Eat responsibly and be grateful!"}
{"text":"Rock Lobster Rocks!  This maybe a bias review as I love seafood.  Rock Lobster fulfilled my seafood fantasy at a reasonable price. This is no Red Lobster as most of the dishes they offers here are not heavy breaded then deep fried or drowned in melted butter and heavy sauce. Here I can really taste the true fresh taste of seafood......... Love.......  We ordered and shared:  Samuel Adams' Toronto Beer Week Sampler and Food Pairing ($15) - Lager/Lattitude 48 IPA/Octoberfest - Mini Lobster Roll/Fresh Oyster in Sam Adams Mignoette/Spaghetti Squash Fries+Rosemary+Sea Salt - Good value and I am able to sample a few of their food offering: I know I won't be ordering their lobster roll but definitely their squash fries on the side  Jerk Crab and Shrimp ($13) - For that price, I have not much expectation but I was delightfully surprised when I saw this overflowing plate of seafood - Everything was cooked perfectly and just with a little kick with the jerk seasoning - I would definitely order that again and I know why my NYC yelp visitor just gave us a little taste because she wanted to keep that all for herself!  Rock Lobster Caesar ($12) - This drink is just so photogenic, still one of my favourite Caesar in town  Lobster Cappuccino ($6) - Really light and milky but lack any lobster taste.. maybe my Yelp friend really ordered a cappuccino and tries to trick me?  Service was attentive and cheerful.   I love Seafood and I will be back for more!!!"}
{"text":"Rock Lobster Food Co originally started up as a pop-up at several food events (such as TUM), and eventually opened a restaurant in 2012. Since then they have added a second location on Queen St. One Saturday night, I had dinner at their original location which was just a short walk away from where I was that night. My favorite seafood of all time has to be lobsters with mussels (being a close second). The menu is a simple one-pager with several lobsters (and seafood) dishes, and another page for drinks.  The Rock Lobster Roll ($14) was served with Yukon chips and a slice of McClure's dill pickle. I have had a couple of different lobster rolls throughout the years, and this one is on the top of my list of favorites. I liked that there was a generous portion of fresh lobster. Additionally, the topped sauce was creamy and the toasty bun made it even better.  The Lobster Mac 'n' Cheese ($14) [fresh lobster, aged Canadian cheddar, and panko crust] was a comforting dish. This dish wasn't a personal favorite of the night but it's good if you have a craving for some mac and cheese with an added seafood twist. There was an okay amount of shredded lobster but you have to dig deep into the cheese to get some. Overall, it was a decent dish and I did like the crispy texture of the panko crust.  Lastly, we got the Lobster Supper ($39) [fresh Nova Scotia lobster, butter, creamed spinach, mashed potato and bread roll]. The steamed lobster was a decent size, as there wasn't that much meat inside of it. However, it tasted pretty good when dipped with the accompanied hot butter. The bread roll was also fresh and buttery. They do have a special on Sunday where it's only $25, which I think is a fairer price for the size of the lobster in comparison to its regular price.  Overall, the dimly lit Ossington Avenue space offers a warming dining experience. If you like lobsters, then this place is pretty good for it."}
{"text":"Way too loud they arent sure if theyre a disco or restrnt. Food was not worthwhile at all. The famous mac n cheese greasy n nasty"}
{"text":"I'd been to Rock Lobster before, the Queen St. location, but when my brother wanted to celebrated his birthday, we decided to hit up the Ossington location. We arrived at around 12:30 on a Sunday and the place was already filling up, yet we are able to secure a table without much difficulty.  We decided to start with the Lobster & 3 Cheese Dip, which is advertised as coming with Nova Scotia lobster, cream cheese, ricotta, cheddar, lemon, chives, and Yukon chips. It arrived piping hot accompanied with kettle-cooked plain chips. The dip was delicious. Creamy and cheesy, it certainly contained a strong lobster flavor. The only issue here was that some of the chips were oversalted to an almost inedible extent.  For the main, I ordered the Lobster Mac 'N Cheese, which boasts Nova Scotia lobster, aged Canadian cheddar, and panko crust. This was absolutely phenomenal. It was super hot and very cheesy; I especially enjoyed the huge ball of cheese located in the middle. The top layer was amazing, but to be honest, the mac itself was a little on the bland side. I helped things along with a sparing addition of the restaurant's house made hot sauce.  All in all, I was very happy with my meal at Rock Lobster and would certainly return."}
{"text":"Let me first start off by saying that I was extremely disappointed by the lobster poutine! If I'm paying 17 for a poutine, I would like a little more lobster on top! There was barely any..  I had also ordered oysters, but they only had two different types. The oysters were well shucked and good overall.  My friend had ordered the lobster roll and just ended up eating just the lobster since the bread was way too buttery.   What did end up getting a good review was the jerk crab and shrimp. The two of my friends who had ordered that dish really enjoyed it and made me wish I had ordered that instead.  One last thing.. THE CAESARS LOOKED PHENOMENAL! I would return just to try that."}
{"text":"came here for their summerlicious menu.  I can honestly say i am not impressed.  We made reservations and had to wait because the place is quite small.  appetizer i received was lobster taco.  1 very small taco, it definitely made me hungrier after eating it because it was so small.  It tasted so so, nothing really amazing about it.    The next dish i ordered was their famous lobster roll.  The lobster roll tasted pretty good.. juicy lobster.  However, portion was very small..  imagine a thicker slice of garlic bread you can get for 50cents at IKEA.  its the same slice of bread but split in the middle and an icecream scoop of lobster topping in the middle... how is that an entree.. couple of dark homemade potato chips and call it a day..  it was like the size of an IKEA hot dog.. dont expect fancy presentation either.   my friend got the chicken and waffles which i tried.. by far the worse chicken and waffles i have ever had in my  life.. IHOPS tasted better tbh.  it sounds really good on paper.. but the waffle was pretty dreadful.  it was rawish.. super super dense and heavy.. absolutely no flavor or sweetness to it.. it was like eating really heavy doughy nothing.. it was drenched in gravy and peas.. nothing went well there.. the chicken was not bad... but the waffle needs work.  Oh yea.. no ketchup for fries or chips.. so we requested for ketchup.. and almost like a joke.. they give you the tiniest trinket of ketchup.. barely the size of my thumb..  only 1 too.. i dipped 5 fries and used it all up.  then it was dessert time.... whale tail, nothing back to say about it.  funnel cake was just fried dough.. presentation was just horrendous.. i will upload pic soon.. white plate and fried squigly dough.. tiny tiny tiny bit of jam and thats it.    service was not bad... since you pour the water yourself whenever your dry...with the automatic 20% tip added on... and tax.. it comes up to approximately 33 dollars..  i would not come back.  Its a joint that makes its money off hipsters really."}
{"text":"Location was great and not far from little Portugal. Had interesting menu. Lobster cheese dip was flavorful and cheesy with amazing homemade chips. Mac n cheese was really good, but did lack a little flavor or salt. Lobster roll was really good but it was more of a snack not dinner portion. It was just as expensive as a dinner item. Waiter was great and very attentive. Cute atmosphere and nice for new comers. Recommend the whale tail for dessert, but sad I had to share it. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"\"Go to Rock Lobster! It is the best of the best on the strip!\"                                            VS \"This place is so over-hyped and overpriced. Don't go, Ev... you'll hate it. .\"   These were the voices of the masses, but who cares about the blah-blahs of the peanut gallery? Not I. So I went with an open mind, a sound heart and an unparallelled love of lobster.   I brought my fave Brits, Camilla Parker-Bowles and Austin Powers, and we all ordered different crustaceous treats. I had the lobster roll and the lobster caesar to drink. The drink was really the highlight. I mean, a lobster tail in my drink? Perf. The lobster dinner is only $39 and the lobster poutine was quite tasty, no matter how strange it sounds.   So there you have it. It's not the best place, but it is definitely better than A-OK. I mean, how can lobster not be?"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Rock Lobster, my first time at this location (Ossington).  We had made reservations for Summerlicious, but was not found on the list, we were able to get a table but was time limited.  Food:  The food was fresh (as per usual) but I found the portions were smaller for Summerlicious.  We had the Lobster Taco, Lobster Roll and Whale Tail (which was a disappointment). Aside from the summerlicious menu, we also ordered a Lobster Poutine, Lobster Mac n' Cheese and a Lobster Ceasar drink....all were to die for and super yummy.  Atmosphere: This location is very small and quaint, does not have an outer part or patio..like the other location.   Overall: I would probably go again, but not during the Summerlicious rush."}
{"text":"I loved the Rock Lobster at Queen and Bathurst so much I had to try this one.  We came here on a week day for an earlier dinner before catching a show at the Lower Ossington Theatre. We got there so early that we were the only people there which I was totally okay with.  It was fantastic! I realized that the two locations had slightly different menus so I needed to order something that wasn't on the other one!   I got the cesar to star which I've had before, delicious as usual, and I got the jerk crab and shrimp. I'm not a huge spicy food eater and this meal was on FIRE!!!!! But needless to say it was delicious. Extremely messy though! Had a bib on and everything, but sometimes it's kind of fun to work for your food!   I will definitely return, great food, great atmosphere and great neighbourhood!!"}
