{"text":"Worst experience ever at this pub.  Got the Wing order wrong and both the wings and fries were cold, sent it back, the wing order was right but they were cold and the fries were luke warm, sent it back again fresh hot wings, but the sauce was wrong and the fries were cold again.  No manager on duty, the bill from someone else's table was brought to us.  So we sent it back and then they brought the full bill.  This surprised me because we've been there before without an issue.  Left my name and number because there was no manager to speak to tonight.  Ended up paying for only our alcohol because we refused to pay for our meal with this crappy service."}
{"text":"Like to watch the football sat mornings Got there a little before opening and was let in and served  coffee while I watched a match Ordered a plate of wings and had a Guinness for lunch ( they pour a great Guinness ) like my wings hot and these  Had good heat but had great flavour, not burn your head off Sauce The server an older lady they called \"Dee\" was a seasoned vet  Treated everyone there like family In fact the group of folks there were very Friendly and though I don't live too close , I will make the trek to catch a match  When I can !"}
{"text":"So this is one of those pubs you go to when it's convenient and you really feel like having a pint to get your evening going after a hard days work.  Located on Sheppard between Don Mills and Victoria Park, makes it a unreachable location... not conveniently at least. It is surrounded by a bunch of office buildings on the south side of Sheppard and all residential on the north.   It is a typical Irish pub. You walk in with a very woody Irish feel. You get the typical mini juke box, vending machine with condoms, candy and gum and an old pool table at the back. Of course I get greeted by an Indian person asking if I wanted to try their curry or butter chicken. Haha! I'm still figuring this whole Irish pub and Indian cuisine connection.  My experience was particularly weird. I sat at the part intending to only have a pint and leave. But then at a specific time a bunch of regulars came in and surrounded me with mini machines in their hands. They all knew each others names, personality and perhaps personal life. Turns out most of the days at the same time they all gather and play those digital trivia games that get displayed on a big screen and you get to pick your answer from your device. I felt very out of place but they were all welcoming.  The drinks were fair with their daily specials. Food wise looked good and based on my past experience wasn't bad either.   Overall it was good. Nothing special.  Like I said it was only a convenient place to visit. I'd still come back. Next time to join the crew in trivia pursuit.... canadian style."}
{"text":"My bf and I decided to be old and go to a pub for St. Patrick's Day NOT in the downtown core. To this end, I have always passed by this pub on my way to the gym, but I was really excited to try it out for the first time.  It definitely is a local pub. Small, and charming when you first walk in, but the place is actually quite big. On my way to the washroom, there was another huge room with a pool table. I couldn't wait to start celebrating the day by ordering a Guinness. We opted not to get the green beer, however, our kind hostess offered to make a green four leaf clover on the Guinness. Yeah!  Food is your usual pub fare. My bf and I ordered a pound of wings for appetizers, and then moved on to traditional pub food. I really wanted the Bangers and Mash, but opted for the all day breakfast and my bf had the Beef Pie which was nothing special. By the time we left (around 7-pm), the place was very busy but I still saw some empty tables. I really liked the atmosphere of this pub and the service was very homely. They do have a patio outdoors, but not sure if its a \"working\" patio...when we left, only smokers were on the patio area.  They have lots of beer on tap, plus lots of big tv's to watch any game playing.  Definitely a pub I will come back too!"}
{"text":"My Dad and I headed to his old favourite, Willie Stout's, formerly Phoenix & Firkin, to watch the Mayweather/Canelo fight. The d√©cor was dated, deep red carpet with deep red upholstery to match. Comfortable and old school.   My Dad ordered the Ribs/Wings/Fries/Veggie combo and I got the Guacamole Bacon Angus Burger. The fries were nothing special, but the food was faaaaabulous. The ribs were flavourful and juicy. I couldn't even steal a wing from my own Dad they were so good!    My burger had all of the major food groups: spice, cheese, veggies, bacon, and beef. Our super awesome server, Bonnie, admitted it was her favourite, so I was excited to give it a shot. It delivered. The guac was fresh and had the yummy spice I'm growing to love. The bacon was crispy and burger was tasty. The guac definitely overshadowed the Monterey Jack. It didn't really even need cheese.   As I mentioned, we had a super awesome server, Bonnie, AND it was fight night. She was amazing. She kept everyone happy and hydrated. Not ordering beer? She still kept your water topped up!   There was no shortage of TVs to watch the fight on plus a projector. The only complaint is that the audio was terrible. You couldn't understand what the commentators were saying. The audio was coming from each individual TV! AAAHH!!   All in all, a good night. Good food and good company."}
{"text":"I pretty much only go Monday nights for their half price wing deal. Service is slow but I'm not in a rush. Wings are decent size and fries portion is generous.   Tip: you can ask for no fries and instead get a couple more wings for those on a keto/low carb diet.   Servers are friendly tho and they usually have the right games on the tv (they're happy to change it if you ask)"}
{"text":"Typical pub.  Food okay.  Pretty dim, not very lively.  Service was friendly.   Has the trivia games which those siting at the bar are typically playing."}
{"text":"For a 10 minute stumble (I mean walk), this pub is pretty stellar old school British with the red felt chairs. Awesome food no matter what you order. Their back ribs are way better than some cruddy rib fest in the middle of no where. Good selection of beer including my fave Rickards white. Can't lose here"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch the other day and it was a better than ok experience.  I got the Angus Guacamole burger and it was HUGE....absolutely massive, I think anything I say now will call for a \"thats what she said joke\" but it really was difficult to eat it....you get the point!  The burger came with guacamole, bacon, onions, tomatoes, lettuce, a lot of cheese and a pickle....the side was half onion rings half fries (first time I ever see this kind of side at a pub?). I only got 3 big onion rings though so I was a tad bit upset :(  I asked for mayo on the side and she brought it right away. We also asked for water with lemon, which 90% of the time I have to ask twice for, and it was done right away too. The service was quick and efficient and the food was super fresh.   The crowd at 12:45pm on a Monday was not the greatest and it smelled like stale beer but whatever, I'm really not picky (others would be). The music wasn't loud and they had a lot of TVs except b-ball was being shown on every one of them.  All in all, this is a great place for lunch. My massive burger was only $12!!"}
{"text":"Went here again last Friday. This is my fourth visit I think and I haven't been let down yet. Service can be a tad slow on nights when there is sporting event going on but overall they are pretty good. If you come to watch a game it might be a good idea to call and book reservations or else you get seated in the back. Not really a bad thing but sometimes the music can be loud back there.  We always get calamari & wings, have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"After driving by this place regularly, we finally made it a destination for an early Sunday dinner. I was disappointed. We were going to share a dinner of assorted appetizers, but couldn't get past the very overcooked (just short of burnt) chicken nachos. I'll call it an 'un-appetizer' because our meal ended there.    I understand that it used to be the Phoenix & Firkin, and it looks like it. The decor was familiar and the service was good but, based on my one-time experience, I can only recommend this place as a watering hole, not a feeding station. (As a side note: I don't understand how a reviewer can call their food 'mediocre' and still give them 4 stars.)"}
{"text":"Pretty good place. If it wasn't for an appointment upstairs i might have not come here. Had their Guacamole Bacon Angus Burger and was satisfied with it. Service was great and everything came hot!  More than likely will come back if the opportunity arises"}
{"text":"Its hard to review this place, because in some aspects it's awesome, and in some it's terrible.   Awesome:  * So many menu items and every day is a different deal. Let's not forget half off apps mon-fri 3-6!   * Free party room rental in the back. I had an event there with adults and young ones and it was the perfect space to let them run around a bit without interrupting anyone.  * Different Beer sizes make for a fun beer sampling experience * Lots of Comfy seating (just watch out for the windows, the winter air can leak in and freeze you)  * Trivia on the TV !   Terrible:  * Service -- while most staff are very nice, many tend to be forgetful or slow. It's not bad enough to warrant a bad tip, but enough that you need to be proactive with waving the staff member over to remember you - especially for water refills.  * Forgetful Cooks -- The food is pretty good, but there's been a few occasions where the kitchen forgets to plate all the items I've ordered."}
{"text":"I used to work in the area and went to willie stouts a few times over the past two years. The place has standard pub fare with an updated menu and seating arrangement which works well. The place is clean, has ample seating, sports on  mostly (great during boxing championships or hockey playoffs) and is a bit dim even for a sports bar.  The people here really make it shine, great friendly staff have no trouble with dine in or takeout orders and they're really good about making accommodations and substitutions. Food is hit and miss, from standard pub fare to really tasty bbq and wraps, there should be something to please everyone. If you get the standard stuff don't get your hopes up, but when you get some of the signature items it ends up being a much better experience."}
{"text":"Dont bother with the \"patio\" it is nothing to enjoy.   As for the indoors, it has a very friendly pub feel. Also the staff are very friendly. I only wish the food was more consistently good. One time we go in there, it is great, the next time we go, it is sub-par. Pretty much a hit or miss with this place."}
{"text":"From the outside, this reminds me of the pubs visited by corrupt villains in the movies. It has the grimiest exterior! I could go on with explicit metaphors but do not want to be sued for libel!  As you can see, I have not outgrown my foolish, childish pop culture imagination. But I am not against checking places out.  And I went there.  With work friends.  It was such a lovely time!  Ok, so back to the actual pub. This place is a long, inside box! There's the bar section with tables. If you continue walking past a small hallway on the right side, you enter a pool room and family room table setting!  So I joined the gang for the predictable green beer. The Rolling Rock hit the spot. The nachos were edible, but for a platter, they seemed mighty medium sized! The company was amazing! But the service was slow. Considering the day, I am neither upset not surprised."}
{"text":"I was here for dinner with coworkers. I ordered the Calamari and the Seafood Linguini, and also tried the Fish and Chips and Philly Cheesesteak appetizer.   Calamari is really hard to mess up, and usually always tastes good. The Calamari was fine - good crispiness. The Fish and Chips are also hard to mess up, and tasted alright, but they overcooked the fish in my opinion. The portion also did not justify the price. The Philly Cheese steak was lackluster - I had a lot of hope but I wasn't impressed. The bread was chewy and there wasn't enough content.  The seafood linguini is probably the worst I've ever had, and I love that dish. The salmon tasted out of place and overcooked, and there were quite a few bones. There were a lot of unnecessary veggies, and what I think were pickles. They should definitely consider replacing the salmon with shrimp.  Service was alright. It was difficult, because we were a large group, but I still feel like it took too long for service to come around.  They have a nice 50% off appetizers deal, which you should definitely take advantage of, because that's probably the biggest appeal for this place. They could definitely use some help."}
