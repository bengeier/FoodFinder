{"text":"My coworkers and I went here for dinner today. The rolls had way too much rice, and while we were there the staff installed a TV above the salad bar and set it to play a bunch of distracting garbage."}
{"text":"Looking for inexpensive bento box... well there are two choices. The deluxe Eaton Box is only 9.99 and comes with miso soup, salad, a large bento box wich included mediocre tempura, decent tofu, and teriyaki Salmon (which was quite good), and 6 small rolls (which were aweful, too much over cooked rice or something)  All in all not bad but I have had nicer and better sushi and tempura. BUT for those on a tighter budget this might be the place to start your sushi journey."}
{"text":"I couldn't agree more with the previous reviewers. There are at least 5 other places in this neighbourhood that blow Sushi Eaton out of the water.  The fish is generally of a very low quality, but doesn't compare to the awful service. We've gone 3 times (apparently we're gluttons for punishment) and every single time they have forgotten portions of our order or ignored us completely. Three strikes and they're out. I'll give my money to a cheaper place that actually wants to sell me decent sushi."}
{"text":"I was surprised by the previous reviews. I ate here with 3 other friends and for all-you-can-eat sushi it was pretty good. We shared quite a few dishes, the unagi was good, the shrimp tempura was good, the tuna sushi pizza was good. We stuffed ourselves and the service was friendly and prompt. I had two large Asahi beers and my bill was $32. The same amount at Fune would have $200. I agree that the sushi is not high end but sometimes I want to gorge so I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Went there 2 times for all-you-can-eat (it was a huge mistake for 2nd visit), both time are pretty bad experience.   I was new to Toronto and this place was the first all-you-can-eat that comes to my sight. First time tried out with one friend. They simply deduct the amount of food that you ordered and served approximately 30% of your orders. If you think the waiter/waitress would come any time soon with the rest of your order, or to take a 2nd round order, you are absolutely wrong. after 30 minutes of waiting for the rest of our food, my friend and I left with empty stomach. It seems like the waiters could wait until we left.     Days after that, another one of my friend comes and wants Japanese food for dinner. So three of us went there again. Same things happened with last time. My friend spoke with the waitress: We have waited for about 40 minutes for the rest of our order, are they coming any time soon? It was then we are getting the rest 70% in the next 60 minutes! What does it mean? They won't serve 70% of your order unless you ask them to! She was totally impatient and seems was annoyed by our demand of the rest of our order!     Not even need to mention the quality of the food, the price (70$ for three of us) and the wait time, just bad experience.       As soon as I found other sushi options, this place is permanently off my eat-out list and I will never return in my life. Both of my friends are from BC and are visiting Toronto for a short time, this place left them with a generally bad impression of Japanese restaurants in Toronto. I really question that whoever runs this place seriously think it is OK to run a business like that? It is totally normal if this place shut down soon. What a shame."}
{"text":"I wish Yelp allowed negative star reviews, because that's what I'd give this place.  I have to agree with the other reviewer Amanda - do not eat here under any circumstances.  Walk exactly 5 minutes west to Yonge and north about a hundred yards on the west side of the street to Ho Su.  Trust me on this.  The first sign things were not going to go well was that a man who might have been the manager or owner arrived when we entered the patio area with a Bluetooth earpiece in his ear (honestly why?), semi-impatient and/or agitated, and announced to us without saying hello that he couldn't be held responsible if \"dust\" ended up on our food and that we'd have to pay for it anyway.  Admittedly it was a bit windy on the patio, but *HE* had steered us away from a less windy seating area after we'd already selected it and sat down.  In the end, we moved back over to where we originally wanted to sit.  Less wind, but still a strange eerie warning from Bluetooth Man.  We should have taken heed of this and left, but we were feeling adventurous I guess.  Let me continue the list of sins: The salad and soup was serve-yourself.  Lame.  Then, less than premium cuts of fish (and warm! ew.) complete with bones left in them!  Everything tasted stale.  The rolls didn't stick together properly, weren't well rolled and were improperly sized for easy eating.  One roll that had a shrimp in it actually had the tail HIDDEN in the roll, so I inadvertently ingested said tail.  When we got the bill, turns out the place is also expensive considering what you get - dinner for 2 with one beer (and no other beverage - I had water) was $50!  Do not be taken in by window advertising or the promise of all-you-can-eat.  You will not want to eat all-you-can; you will in fact want to return all-you-can to sender in a burlap sack under cover of darkness."}
