{"text":"Portion sizes are INSULTING! Quality is HORRIBLE. Stay away or you will be offended. Also, DO NOT TRY THE BAKLAVA...they are 2 small sample servings for $3."}
{"text":"Inexpensive, good quality, fresh food served by kind staff.

The review has to be longer to count, so I'll say I ordered a wrap once, (chicken shwarma) and a salad another time. I tried their drinks with the basil seeds and that was fun!
Is this long enough? Good job, Maybes!"}
{"text":"I bought take out, I'm less than 10 min walk....
the food was tasty ( 4* for me) but it was cold.i had to warm it in my oven so 3* because of that"}
{"text":"It's quick, cheap and the food is decent. 

There are no bells and whistles. No exposed brick wall. No chalkboards. No indie music. It's refreshing for this neighborhood.

What really makes this place one of my neighborhood favorites, however, is the people who work there. They are constantly warm, welcoming and helpful - both in-person and on the phone."}
{"text":"So I was taking the walk along Eglinton telling myself, that I'll try and get something healthy and fast for lunch.  As I walked and walked, my eyes looked here and there, through the construction for food.  As I approached Eglinton & Redpath I spotted Maybes Lebanese Food.  I said to myself, maybe I'll have this.  For some reason I started thinking of that Marvel easter egg scene where they were eating Schwarma, and thought maybe I'll see Iron Man.

Going in, the place has a moderate size, and a large menu posted on the wall.  It took me three seconds to decide on the Beef Shwarma.  The lady taking my order was pretty friendly and we chatted while she makde my Shwarma.  Of note, this was the first time I had heard fo having my Schwarma toasted instead of grilled, so I had it toasted.  I ate in store, I think that they have three long tables or maybe two.

They seem to do a decent online order in advance business, as a few people came in to pick up their orders.

My Shwarma was pretty good.  For me it was a little gooier than I would have preferred, reduce the liquid by 10% and it would have been a perfect Shwarma.  I guess that Chloe (another reviewer of this establishment) and I could never have a love affair based on Shwarma.  Still, Maybes, I will go back."}
{"text":"The portions here are not very filling; the workers barely give you any veggies in your wrap and the meat portions are also small. They give you more sauce than the actual toppings, which is not very good because your wrap will get soggy. For what it's worth though, I suppose it meets the standards. It's a cheap place to eat and it's usually filled with high school students (afterall it IS close to 3 public ones). Despite the friendly and welcoming service, the wait to get served is a bit long. I would really give this place a 2.5 if I could, but I digress. The meat itself was quite tender so I'll round them up to that 3 star rating. What I really liked about this spot was that we had the option of either toasting or grilling our wrap. If you prefer a crunch to it, definitely have yours grilled. Otherwise, go with the usual: toasted wrap!"}
{"text":"Learned about shawarama in Ottawa and had it for lunch during high school for 4 years almost everyday. Nowhere in Toronto has a shawarama place that impresses me. Took the first bite of their shawarama today, all i gotta say is their garlic is legit! Will order fries with it next time!"}
{"text":"all the food is absolutely old, cheap and disgusting and does not taste anything like lebanese food....look for authentic tasty food ? look somewere else. This place doesnt even pass as low grade fast food."}
{"text":"The chicken shawarma wraps are fairly decent here, I have been here on 3 occasions and can say that so far it has been consistently good, the service is quick and efficient and the cost of the sandwich is around the Toronto average of about $6. I have also picked their grilled chicken burger for a friend and he thought it was a good burger, you have the option of having it fried or grilled. Cost of burger was $5 no sides."}
{"text":"After a foiled attempt at ordering Indonesian, we felt like trying something new and a little off the beaten path, which is what led us to Maybes. (I mean, you generally can't go wrong with Middle Eastern, as far as I'm concerned.)

It took me all of five seconds to figure out what I wanted: Chicken and Beef Mix Shawarma Platter (\"served with rice, tabouli, veggies, pickles, spicy potatoes and a pita\"). And although the food was far from hot by the time it arrived at my apartment, I nevertheless enjoyed my meal more than I thought I would.

The chicken and beef pieces were rife with those irresistible crunchy end bits that are the mark of good shawarma, which definitely made up for the fact that the meat wasn't exactly the most flavorful I had (ie more spices, please). The accompanying sides were all perfectly acceptable, although the three potato were far from spicy (and somewhat bland, really).

I should also note that my dining companion ordered the Falafel Platter (\"6 falafel balls with tabouli, salad pickles, tahini sauce, hot sauce, hummus/ garlic and a pita\") and wasn't too impressed, although that was mostly due to the falafel being hard to eat. (Turns out falafel is a food item that really has to be eaten fresh.)"}
{"text":"Maybes is really unassuming, with a plain interior and just a few tables to sit at, but what it lacks in ambience it makes up for in food and service.

The staff are incredibly friendly and chat with you as they prepare your food. Every time I come here I get the chicken shawarma platter ($12.99). It's huge and comes with chicken, rice, potatoes, lettuce, onions, tomatoes, pickles, turnips, tabouli, mini samosas, hummus, garlic, tahini, hot sauce, and pita on the side. It's A LOT of food and tastes so good when all mixed together."}
{"text":"It's your average shawarma joint! Great thing is, it's the only one nearby out on the streets of Yonge and eg! Eating their shawarma sandwiches out on the streets is always a problem. The first few bites are easy, but the watered down sauce settle at the bottom in your hands. It accumulates and falls all over you and the ground around! 
The meat's texture is delicious and price is fair!
The service is great, staff is the friendliest of any shawarma joint I've ever seen!"}
{"text":"Ok so the store manager requested for me to remove my bad review of them based on my previous experience (I found a metal nail in my beer shawarma)  with the restaurant. To be fair, the store manager was calm and very polite while he tried to solve the problem for me and gave me a free meal after all. So, to be fair, I'm willing to take it down since the store manager decided to own up to their mistake. 

But in terms of their food, I have to admit it is not the best shawarma I've had. I love the salad, the food smelled really good and the portion was huge but the beef shawarma was very dry and they were difficult to bite on and swallow; the bakhlava was terribly sweet and I did not manage to finish it cz of that.

However, they do have a lot more food variety that I did not manage to try on. I'm only commenting based on my sole experience on beef shawarma and bakhlava that I had."}
{"text":"I went to Maybes Restaurant for lunch. Maybes Restaurant sell Middle East food like shawarma and falafel. Maybes restaurant is a plainly decorated restaurant, but it is clean. The server was friendly and very nice.

I ordered the chicken shawarma pita sandwich. It was tasty and not overstuffed like other pita sandwich I have eaten at other places. The sandwich did not fall apart.

Would I go back? Probably since the food is pretty good and affordable."}
{"text":"Ordered here for the first time last night for a group and it was absolutely delicious! So fresh and it lots of food for a great price.  I will definitely order again.  We had chicken shawarmas, Fatoosh salad and hummus all amazing."}
{"text":"Service sucks. Place is bland. Unsure why this is even in this area. Especially since your food made me SICK!!! 
DO. NOT. EAT. HERE!!!! Take your $10 and bring it anywhere else."}
{"text":"Legitimately terrible. I'm not one to waste food, and I'll eat something even if it's not great. I took one bite out of the shawarma wrap and I was done. The chicken was hard, the bread was soggy, the sauces were watery, the vegetables were old and spoiled and brown. It was an absolute disaster. I'll never eat here again."}
{"text":"Not the best shawarma, not even in the neighborhood  (you know what I mean, y and e is famous for lacking a good shawafel place).

With that said, this place has been through many iterations and I gotta say it's not the worst in the current one.

Chicken on the rocks is a good deal (must get garlic on a side and put some sriracha on it). Their falafels are quite tasty too actually."}
{"text":"Been going to this Lebanese joint place off and on for the last year / year and a half.  Food normally is good.  On April 12th I had an unpleasant customer service incident which resulted me writing a poor review.  While unfortunately it wasn't solved that night when I returned to the restaurant the owner did reach out to me and over the course of the next few days to tried to make up for the unfortunately incident. I do appreciate the gesture and that they restaurant is taking steps to prevent these types of mishaps in the future.  

Since the issue has been for the most part resolved and since the restaurant has made attempts to make things right I have updated my review from a 1 star to a 3 star."}
