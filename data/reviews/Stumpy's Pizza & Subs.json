{"text":"We tried Stumpys after a recommendation from a friend when we moved into the neighborhood. Nothing but great things to say. The pizza is bomb, the sandwiches are fantastic, and I think I foodgasmed just a bit over my calzone tonight. It showed up 25 min after ordering, hot, fresh, and delicious. Our new go to pizza place."}
{"text":"I do not like their subs at all.  I got mine baked and it was like crusty and burnt with hardly any filling inside.  Their pastas however TO DIE FOR!  Baked ziti is my favourite from them, their lasagna is also very delicious.  comes with garlic bread.  Can't rave enough about the ziti though!"}
{"text":"This place has great pizza.  Crust not to thick.  Chewy and crispy.  Very flavorful sauce."}
{"text":"When I first moved to the neighborhood, I was skeptical that I would find and solid dining places. Lucky for me I stumbled upon Stumpy's during our move in process. It's cheap if you have one of their coupons that they give out so often, and it's better tasting and a lot less greasy than any of the chain pizza places you usually go to.  My advice would be to spend the extra dollars on their specialty pizzas because they are definitely worth it. They and huge and loaded with toppings, and there is something for everyone. Stumpy's is really good for their prices and I go here for a movie night or a birthday party or for a little guilty pleasure. I love The Works pizza."}
{"text":"I always come in for the spicy Italian sub. I don't know if it's the vinaigrette, the fresh meat, or the right amount of mayo but stumpies has it figured out!   I also recently tried the wing ding pizza. I'm not sure what a wing ding is but holy hell it's delicious! It's chicken and cheese with a buffalo like sauce. That's the best way I  can describe it. One of my favorite pizzas now.   And the service is always A+! It seems like it's mostly high school kids that work there but they are trained right and held to high standards. I have never had a bad experience here!"}
{"text":"My favorite now. At least three times a week. (Dangerous I know). These people are so cool and the pizza is just solid as hell. The wings are really great too. Pizza oven baked without all that grease. Hard working good folk."}
{"text":"The pizza was good, but I am not sure why the reviews are so high? I would eat it again, but I don't think it was amazing. The woman who took our order over the phone was very friendly though, and the delivery was fast."}
{"text":"Just picked up my first pizza from there. 16\" The Works! Fantastic!! The whole family is hooked. Fresh,flavorful, not greasy.....yummy!!"}
{"text":"One of the best Italian subs I've ever had. They were also fast, friendly and competent. I can't wait to try their pizza."}
{"text":"Stumpy's has been our go-to place for years.  I remember when they first opened and I'd take my small kids over to watch them make our pizza.  The service has always been wonderful and they make a great pizza.  Our favorite happens to be the works: topped with fresh ingredients, sausage, onions, pepperoni, mushrooms.  Yum!  They know me by name, know what we like, and always have a great big smile for us when we come in to pick up our order (even though they deliver, I enjoy going in to see everyone).  UPDATE:  Stumpy's is still offering wonderful pizza and subs. They have added delivery within a certain area, but I still like to go to say hello and watch my pizza come out of the oven.  Fridays are busy, so don't be surprised if you have a bit of a wait, but it is well worth it, as they make everything from scratch."}
{"text":"Now this a how a small business should be run, great menu and great staff. A staple in north central Phoenix, Stumpys has great pizza and wings. Lunch specials that come out fast, weekly specials and neighborhood coupons. Visit enough times and they remember you by name. Dine in a lot and you and your family will get your picture on the wall. Its a small spot but has just the right amount of space."}
{"text":"I ordered Stumpy's pizza for the first time last night because I was tired of all the corporate pizza places nearby my girlfriends place, I wanted something different, something REAL, and now that I have experienced their signature pizzas, I can honestly say Stumpy's does it RIGHT! Everything was prepared like it actually should be (like a real pizzeria) unlike these franchise pizza corporations. I have a NEW pizza spot while I'm at my girlfriends now, I HIGHLY recommend (if you already haven't) you try it!"}
{"text":"everything about this place spits hot fire, and spitting hot fire is gooooooood!  Chase and the crew rock it without even breaking a sweat.  Pizza. Wings. all great, but if you think you are ready for it, try the italian sub on crispy sourdough, hot with everything and habanero mayo,  call it \"The Matt\" BOOM! Instant classic.  Don't even try another sub in the state, it's a waste of time.  Stumpy's is it."}
{"text":"With the heavenly smells of browning crust and cooking toppings greeting me upon walking in the door, it was like entering in a neighborhood pizzeria that I'd been going to my entire life with its almost-tangible, homey comfort. And as soon as I saw the pizzas on the tables around me, I knew that I had found something special.  Having phoned-in my pizza order for take-out, I stepped up to the register to pay and noticed a sign suggesting that I try a cannoli for dessert... Cannolis! Are you serious?! It's like someone took my favorite fattening foods (minus cheddar goldfish crackers & McDonalds fries) and crammed them into one easy-to-access location.  I'm sensing a lot more exercise in my future to offset the caloric intake (and yes, I did have them add a cannoli to my order)... anyway... back to the pizza!  It's probably good that I drive a stick-shift car because it was all that I could do to not grab a piece and start munching on my ride back home. After seeing all the other pizzas at the restaurant and imagining how they tasted, the smells permeating my car were like an intoxicating siren's call. After an extremely long, ten minute drive back to my house, I was finally able to open up the box that contained my treasure: a Greek pizza... Kalmata olives, banana peppers, red onion, artichoke hearts, feta & mozzarella cheeses piled on top of a crust that I would call just about perfect."}
{"text":"Really good place to eat , but really small dining , the wings are baked that's a plus ! The owner is there sometimes cooking , it is one of of favs :)"}
{"text":"I have only tried the pizza but I can tell you from my experience this is the best pizza in the valley!  Never have I had a wrong order (and I have ordered there many times) or a bad experience. The ranch dressing is delicious and a great compliment to the pizza."}
{"text":"I work in the neighborhood, and it's part of my routine to give Stumpy's a visit every Monday.  It's good enough to keep me coming back every time.  They have a wide selection of toppings for pizza and a good variety of sandwiches if that's your thing (I'm a pizza guy, myself).  It's made fresh right in front of you with quality ingredients.  I'm somewhat of a pizza aficionado, and I always recommend Stumpy's to anyone who enjoys a slice now and then."}
{"text":"I quite like their pizza.  This tiny little shop on Northern Avenue has a seating facility for approximately 16 people but they have quick turnover during lunchtime and the place is exceptionally well run for a small business.   When I went there I wasn't very adventurous with the toppings, just stuck to plain old pepperoni and mushroom. They prepared the pizza right in front of us, the service was quick and the huge slice was so hot that I could hardly hold it with my fingers. They seem to be making changes to and improving their business every week.  My colleagues and I are definitely going back to Stumpy's to try their subs and more."}
{"text":"This is exactly what a neighborhood pizza place should be. The dough is perfect. Thin, hand tossed (literally... they throw them up in the air), fresh toppings. I loved the marguerita and my girl loved the greek. The slice and a salad combo is a great value too."}
{"text":"I have been back two more times and the subs are just as good as the first time.  Again, the people are really personable and they repeatedly thanked me for my business. Try the pastrami sub its really good!"}
{"text":"After working in the area for 2 years I finally checked out Stumpy's on the suggestion of a friend, and wow, I was missing out!   The place is small and no frills, but they are churning out some huge sandwiches with quality ingredients and some delicious looking pizza.  While $9.50 including tax, for a sub, drink and chips sounds a bit pricey, the sandwich can easily cover you for 2 meals.  While I waited for my to go order, the slices of pizza I saw coming out of the oven where huge!  They had thin crusts and were piled high with toppings, I almost wanted to change my order....but I guess I will just have to come back another day!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and bread sticks are good and salad is so good with blue cheese dressing!!!!!! It was great and great soft drinks were good and I liked the sports were on the TVs not that busy around 6-7pm!"}
{"text":"Roommate told me I would love this place. So I ordered delivery, food was good but unfortunately I didn't get my whole order. Supposed to get 24 wings and they only sent 12. I've called about 8 times and no answer. Never ordering delivery again, and probably won't be eating there either. When you pay $36 plus tip you expect everything you pay for."}
{"text":"I love wings..prolly my favorite comfort food- wing pizza, a good idea in concept- extremely difficult to get right in execution.   I moved to the area about a year ago, and found Stumpy's on a hungry wednesday night. They have a pizza called the \"wingding\"- easy to glance over. But worth a second look. - This is NOT your typical wing pizza. From the bleu cheese base, to being able to add any of their house wing sauces- it's the most unique, and delicious \"Wing\" Pizza I have ever had.    At this point you might be thinking- ok great- or big deal- that does nothing for me, \"I'm not a wing person, so what?\"- Soooo.. This little pizza got me to try just about every pizza they make, their desserts, and their bread sides.    I've ordered online, (easy, though an account is needed), over the phone, through grubhub at one point, and have dropped by and picked things up quite a few times. Their service has always been exceptional and delivery on time (or early) and the delivery driver courteous. - when ordering for delivery everything, through them has been accurate (there was a confusion on garlic breadsticks once through grubhub)- whether that be online or over the phone.   4/5 for Excellent food, all around, and great consisted quality, both in service and food.  -1 star due to a somewhat clunky online ordering experience, and their crust compared to some, needs the toppings, to make it whole (not the tear it off and munch crust, or cheese and pepperoni pizza crust)- also somewhat pricey com paired to larger chains, no coupons for speciality pizzas that they give out- which would prolly make me come back for a lot more.   All in all, this is my favorite neighborhood pizza spot. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I love Stumpy's pizza.  If you want a homemade pizza with quality ingredients and want to support a locally owned business, this is the place to go.  The pizza is tasty and they deliver too."}
{"text":"I love the Italian subs. Pizza is not too bad either. Cool staff/service when I pick up. Go!"}
{"text":"We've had takeout and delivery, and it's good pizza!  Woodfire oven baked goodness!  Definitely will continue to frequent this shop - especially on nights we're too pooped to cook for ourselves.  So glad to have them around!"}
{"text":"I hate giving bad reviews. Actually this is the lowest review I've ever given. I'm not sure what else to do when I pay $23 for a pizza that arrives cold and so soggy it's completely inedible. Straight to the garbage and off to buy dinner for the second time tonight. Awesome."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I know of in Phoenix - and now they deliver. If they'd only be open on Sundays, when most hangovers occur, they'd be unstoppable.  Incredible sauce, great crust, pleasant owners. Try the sliced sausage topping. The only downside is this is NOT healthy fare - I don't know what the calorie count is per slice, but it's up there."}
{"text":"Dang, This pizza place is a sleeper. I have lived in the neighborhood 20 yrs.     Their pizza is the BEST around for the money.  I try to always eat Stumps about every Sunday night as a treat.     Get it to go and I love the pizza even after I have to freeze some I don't eat.   Get a pizza stone and you are all set.. BillyRay"}
{"text":"Love your pizza!!! However Every time I ask for delivery there is either an issue or you're \"too busy\" and have to check. I live 5 minutes away. Don't advertise delivery if it's always an issue. I'd gladly come pick it up without the irritation of feeling like I'm inconveniencing a business.  Pizza is 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Literally, the best pizza in the whole Phoenix Metro area.  If you don't like this place chances are that nobody likes you and you're a complete moron.  You know who you are! Lol!"}
{"text":"I will never use GrubHub or eat at Stumpy's again after my last experience. The order took about 30 minutes longer than expected. When it did finally arrive, it was cold and we were missing about 1/3 of the items we ordered. I even pre-tipped them a 30% tip in the hopes that it would arrive a little quicker. Nope. I emailed GrubHub, they said they spoke with Stumpy's and the missing items were on their way. Well nothing ever showed up, the restaurant never refunded our money for the missing items and GrubHub shrugged it off with a \"we're sorry, here's $5 off your next order\" canned reply. That was a fraction of the value of the items we were shorted. This fly-by-night service is DOA in my book. I'll use other local delivery services going forward and steer clear of shady-Stumpy's. I cannot believe they would say they delivered items when they did not - TWICE!!! The whole experience was pathetic and disappointing."}
{"text":"I love that Stumpy's is our neighborhood pizza joint!  My husband and I love pizza and Stumpy's was an accidental discovery for us about four years ago.  Sometimes, accidents are good.  Real good.  Their pizza is consistently delicious and the people who work here are always friendly.  I haven't tried anything but their pizza and it keeps us coming back.  Try it, you'll be hooked."}
{"text":"OMG My Friend Brent AKA Stumpy Owns this Place!"}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome food.  Recently had family move to Phoenix.  My husband found this.  The pizza is great and a great variety of sandwiches and salads.  Service is also really great and very friendly."}
{"text":"Just ate here today.  A buddy of mine took me. Great sub good pizza! service was nice too. thank guys. Don't make it to your side of town a lot but when I do Im there."}
{"text":"Best subs in Arizona!! Get the Italian classic with habenaro mayo!! Omg! Sooo good! The service is awesome and fast! Pizza is spot on as well!! Don't think just go to stumpys!"}
{"text":"We're out of towners using Yelp to eat in tonight.  We were really happy with The Works from Stumpy's - excellent flavor, nice bready but crisp crust periphery, complimentary fresh garlic :), and fast delivery.  I'd recommend and definitely order from again.  (Please send napkins with delivery).  Did I mention the great fresh garlic?"}
{"text":"Every time we're in Arizona at the Pointe Hilton Sqaw Resort we always order Stumpy's.  They deliver to hotel, quick & food is hot. Great pizza, best chopped salad and wings."}
{"text":"Customer service, great price and an excellent pizza. After reading some of the reviews I am encouraged to take a moment and talk about the sandwich's. Look if there is something that you want that is not on the menu, they will make it with a smile.   For years I have worked the menu, sometimes I will spend a few return trips on one sandwich just making sure I really like it. It is worth your time to take a drive and enjoy the food, they are not open on Sunday's and thats ok but just a heads up."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza I've ever had and top 3 with wings. It's a little pricey but if you have the money you have to go. They've messed up our order twice in the over 3 years we've been going, and both times they were very professional, giving us free drinks and rushing to fix it. I would definitely recommend going to Stumpy's."}
{"text":"Super busy Pizza & Sub shop with great food, everything is good!  They have a awesome spread they put on the subs too!"}
{"text":"Best pizza and sub's around.  If you don't get the Italian sub you are missing out, I'm hooked on habanero mayo."}
{"text":"Don't leave Stumpy's with takeout without checking your order.  In the 17 years I've been in Phoenix the only good pizza I've found is Pizzeria Bianco. I keep looking for decent pizza that is more accessible and less expensive. Read the reviews here and decided to try Stumpy's.  First disappointment - I ordered online for takeout and was charged roughly $2.50 extra for the privilege of ordering online. They ought to give discounts for that.  Second disappointment - the pizza. Ordered a large with ground sausage, mushrooms and black olives. We got home and discovered that we had a large with pepperoni, some mushrooms, and a few scattered molecules of sausage. No olives. We don't hate pepperoni, but we don't like it either and we didn't order it because we didn't want it. We tried to remove it but it was the bottom layer and they were VERY generous with the ingredient we didn't want. It literally appeared as if they took a pre-made pepperoni pizza and tossed a little mushroom and sausage on it rather than make the pizza we ordered. We love black olives, which was why we ordered them. Other than the fact that the crust was limp we can't say what the pizza is like - we could taste nothing but pepperoni, and we didn't like it.    Third disappointment - the salad.  It has it's good points - the lettuce was fresh, but it was all ribs, no leaves. It has things your usual side salad doesn't have - green peppers, mushroms, black olives - yeah, there were a lot of them in the salad, none on the pizza - but the salad would be improved by the addition of other standard items oddly missing at Stumpy's - carrot and red cabbage.  I doubt if we will try Stumpy's again, but if we do we won't order online, we won't leave without checking that we got the pizza we ordered rather than someone else's leftover pepperoni pizza, and we will skip the salad."}
{"text":"The ultimate calzone.  I've had a lot of calzones, and this one takes the cake hands down.  I think I could eat one every day.  Made with ricotta and whatever you want.  Even the marinara to dip in is extra fabulous.  Friendly staff, always busy.  I hear the pizza is good too!"}
{"text":"One of the best Pizza's I've had. It's a small place - only a couple of tables - Carry Out is their main business. Medium Wings were great also and Fresh Salad. Wish they had real dishes and utensils though - I don't like all that Styrofoam - maybe they could find a more eco-friendly product."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. Fan-freaking-tactic pizza. Truly some of the best ive ever had. The owner is a really nice lady who made my pizza herself. I would recommend this to anyone. If only I lived closer I would have it more often."}
{"text":"Been ordering pizza from Stumpy's for some time now, and its pretty darn tasty.  I am super picky about pizza and my least favorite part of pizza is the sauce.. yeah, yeah, I know-weird... but anyways..  When I order pizza I always as for easy sauce and very few places actually give me easy sauce.  Stumpy's however, always listens.. which is greatly appreciated.  The pizza is always ready prompt and piping hot and fresh and they very frequently have coupons available which is an added bonus to their already reasonable prices!  Love this mom and pop!"}
{"text":"Dropped in for some dinner on a random Tuesday night. The place is nothing to write home about. It is located in a strip center with little ambiance.   That said, the pizza (whiteout) and the bread sticks that we ordered were very good. The pizza was a generously topped olive oil, basil, garlic, tomatoes, romano, mozzarella, and ricotta. The crust was toward the thin side, but crisp and good.   The bread sticks were definitely covered with olive oil and cheese. Some might think it was a bit greasy, but I was digging it.  Not sure, but I am guessing that the bulk of their business is delivery.   N*joy"}
{"text":"This is a Real joint For good subs and pizza Even it diesla not have the nieces exterior appeal the delicious food makes it up"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints! Best pizza in Phoenix, in my opinion. Great pizza, friendly service. Order the pizza to go and get the wingding with mild sauce. You will not regret it."}
{"text":"Stumpy's is the BEST!! Their food and service are outstanding.   Pizza, 'the works' is GREAT!!  They have an Italian sub, get it hot. It is delicious!  Wings BBQ are delicious."}
{"text":"They have the best pizza crisp thing ever! My boyfriend and I get it all the time. Addicted! The Wings are super bomb. I'm very picky when it comes to wings but I love theirs. And their pizza is great as well!  how they do the thin crust is perfect!"}
{"text":"This is a better than average pizza place. The only drawback, and it is minor, is the food takes a bit longer to prepare."}
{"text":"The Saturday after breaking my liver and recovering from a hangover, I decided that pizza sounded great! I love supporting non-chain establishments, the mom and pop shops of my hood. I decided to order a pizza from Stumpy's.   Meh. It wasn't awful, it wasn't inedible, but it didn't knock my socks off. The sauce was a little plain and I ordered extra cheese on my pizza and got just enough cheese to cover the sauce.  I am willing to try Stumpy's again because the service is so friendly and the pizza is prepared right in front of you. Maybe I should start with a plain pepperoni before going into the sausage and onion realm. Maybe I got a little crazy on my first trip. No...I don't think so, but I'm willing to give them another shot."}
{"text":"Food was great, we had a slice and side salad combo. Fresh salad with homemade ranch, will make sure to stop in again next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"Late night stop close to our hotel. Thanks to Yelp we found this place and I'm glad we did. Great inexpensive pizza joint! The staff was also very friendly. They even told me where the best Mexican restaurant in town is. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Best place everrrrrrr! The pizza is what you crave! If you like New York style pizza:) my husband gets the works, I get pepperoni and man! The toppings are SO fresh! You can also get a monster slice which is clutch during lunch. But I am writing this for their SUBS. God Bless Stumpy's and their subs! It's the mayo...believe me, don't skip the mayo. If you like heat, get the habanero mayo, you won't be sorry! This place is so unassuming! It's in a strip mall in my hood but it is always bumping! Closed on Sundays :( the wings are amazing too! Yikes, now I'm hungry! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Excellent neighborhood pizza joint! Tasty, quick, and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"A few of my friends and tell me how good this place was so finally decided to check it out the First Walk-In places very small their Pizza Station was right in the front you could easily watch them make your food which was kind of cool does a little hurry side grab a couple slices I was really surprised how good they were the dough was very tasty had some good flavor it was almost like a good french bread I enjoyed the sauce as well not too sweet a grape flavored good enough of garlic and oregano the only thing I didn't care for was the cheese it was a little chewy and it had a almost provolone flavor to it not too sure though I had to go I would recommend eating in there because they put the slices in a styrofoam box if you have to go any distance pizzas and get real soggy that would be bad I ended up eating in my car but I wouldn't happen but definitely will be back"}
{"text":"Friday night, long day at work.  Didn't feel like cooking and yeah got a delicious pizza....fantastic.  They took great care of us."}
{"text":"We decided to try Stumpy's after hearing several good things about it, and we were NOT disappointed. Several reviews mentioned the Whiteout pizza, so we ordered a large to go, along with the breadsticks and homemade meatballs.   The pizza was incredible--garlicy, cheesy, with tomatoes and fresh basil and the most delicious chunks of ricotta throughout. I'm going to be having dreams about it, I can tell.  Breadsticks were also killer--also super-garlicky and covered in cheese, with a yummy marinara on the side.   My husband said the meatballs were perfect as well.  We placed our order online and it was ready when promised, hot and delicious.   We will definitely be back. Excited to have a new favorite pizza place!"}
{"text":"I used to live in this neighborhood so I've ordered their pizza and loved it but I saw a video on facebook of them making a sandwich and it looked delicious! So I went in to order one and I swear to God it was one of the best sandwiches I've ever had! The service was amazing as well because I obviously ordered my sandwich the wrong way and the guys where kind enough to correct me HOT is the only way to go! I suggest to go on an off time like 2 to 4 because if not it's so busy you're gonna wait a while. (A sign that that place has good food)"}
{"text":"While getting my nails done next door my stomach was growling uncontrollably. The minute the nail tech was finish I paid, headed out the door without thinking about going to my car, I walked into Stumpy's.   Stumpy's most definitely is neighborhood spot and possibly make the best Italian Cold Cut sub I've had in Phoenix. What I loved abut it was nothing about I the sub taste \"classic\". It was certainly an Italian sub ... Thick cut salami, provolone (smoked), but it didn't taste like a Classic Italian sub from back east. I loved it!!! Absolutely loved it!!   Will definitely go back in a few weeks. Oh... I ordered by Italian sub cold ... Yelpers love it hot!! I'm trying it hot next time!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite lunch place. It is right by my new house and I am stoked to have a local go-to spot. The hot veggie sandwich is excellent and the dressing has such a savory flavor. The garlic breadsticks are some of the best I've had. Haven't had pizza yet but plan to soon."}
{"text":"we were staying at the local resort and decided to get a few pies for takeout. We went with the Hawaiian and the Philly Cheese Steak pizza. When you walk in, your smacked in the face by the smell of ooohey gooey cheese and baked pies. Nuff said. Great.  The pizza was pretty good. It's not comparable to Cibo or LGO but this is a different kind of pizza joint. It's more in the realm of Pizza hut, Papa Johns and  Dominos except it KILLS them. can't say too much about great quality pies made at a local pizza spot, definitely a gem if your in the area and looking for a good pie"}
{"text":"I was at the American Italian club playing bocce and decided to grab a pizza on my way home. Opened up the phone to Yelp and found this place right up the street. Had good reviews so i gave it a try and was really glad I did cause this place is awesome! Got a large The Works and added the garlic and jalapeno. Was really a great pizza and everyone loved it. Next time I tried the Whiteout, it was really great also. It's a small place and I don't think they have any beer but the pizza is awesome. I recommend it to anyone who loves a great hand tossed pizza!"}
{"text":"I found this place through the yelp app while staying at the Squaw Peak Hilton over Memorial Weekend. I ordered a pizza from them about 10 minutes before closing. They told us it would take 15-20 mins. It was less than that. I bought a medium cheese pizza for the kids, and ordered a large half \"Works\" and half \"Philly\" pizza. We were charged $1 extra for having two sauces. But that was cool because we got to try more than one pizza.  Really small hole in the wall. They were very unorganized on the phone I will admit. I was put on hold while the waitress talked to someone else. She didn't put me on mute so at first I didn't know who she was talking to. I called back a second time and the same thing happened. I was about to hang up again but we were hungry, and hunger won out. I could hear that the delivery time would be about 45 mins. for a late Saturday night and decided to pick it up.  Our pizzas were about $35 for the two. Great crust, lots of toppings, good amount of sauce. My husband came back to the hotel with the yummy goodness and was stopped several times by people asking where he went. He gave them the coupons from the top of the box. I hope they got business from that. We'd definitely order from them again when in AZ."}
{"text":"AWESOME EVERYTHING! Amazing pizza, sandwiches, salads, I've never had anything that wasn't amazing. Owners work their restaurant and they are the best. The staff is friendly and efficient. The \"works\" pizza, the french dip and italian sandwiches are 3 of my favorites. They even make giant oatmeal cookies that are the best I've had . Anyone who doesn't give this place 5 stars needs to give it another chance. This place rocks! -"}
{"text":"We are in town for vacation and decided on pizza. We ordered the Whiteout & the Barbey as well as some hot wings. This pizza was the best pizza i have had in a long time. The wings were great too. Not to hot and cooked just right. I would suggest this pizza place and if there was one closer to home I would make this my go to pizza place."}
{"text":"Pretty good. The pizza was decent and the calzone would have been great if it didn't have too much ricotta. Overall good though, if you live in the area I would definitely suggest checking it out"}
{"text":"Very Poor Customer Service Skills. Got a sandwich to go. Got all the way home to find the bottom of sandwich seeping with fluids and soggy enough bread to bait a hook! Drive back and informed them. Even though they remade the sandwich not one person offered me a discount on my next order or anything to compensate me for my additional time and inconvenience.  Generally, the food is very good but their is a serious lack of customer service..."}
{"text":"Ladies and Gentlemen lend me your ears...   Do not go anywhere else for a calzone but Stumpy's. They are amazing, well specifically \"The Works\" Calzone is amazing. If you want a Cheese Calzone please read my two digressions below..    1: Just fold a piece of cheese pizza in half 2: You're a weirdo and I don't trust you.  Anyways, Calzones are designed to fit all the goodness that a pizza just can't handle and Stumpy's has perfected it. I ordered it for pick-up and it was ready when I got there, customer service was on point, they had the National Corn-Hole Championships on (well done management, well done) and the food was still hot when I got home. The Calzone was not a soggy pile of mush but rather a crunchy buttery vessel containing what a calzone ought to, literally everything they would fit, and for that I thank you Stumpy's. God Bless America, God Bless Stumpy's, I'm Out!"}
{"text":"Delicious.   The hot Italian sandwich on wheat with everything is the best sandwich I've ever had and I've heard others say it.  Pizza is fantasic.   The owner Chase and his wife are so friendly and so is all the staff."}
{"text":"I have been going to stumpies 4 years every time i go the pizza is always hot and fresh"}
{"text":"Dig this place.  Tried all the other local pizza shops, and this is the only one we have ever ordered more than once from. And we will continue to order from them; they kick ass!  Pizza is good. Thin crust, very NY foldable style, not too chewy. Good sauce, cheese and toppings.  Salads are awesome here. They must be putting opioids in the lettuce or something, because we have to order one every visit.  Wings are also very good. Baked, well sauced and not too oily. Good heat on anything Hot or better.  You cannot go wrong for take out here. Best in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This is our favorite neighborhood pizza spot. Great crust and yummy toppings."}
{"text":"So good!! Very friendly staff and patrons. Everyone always seems to be a regular when you go in there. I've had their plain cheese and also a pepperoni with sausage. My New Yorker boyfriend gave his seal of approval by eating almost the whole pizza lol. We'll be ordering again for sure! Call ahead for take out. They are great, so it's busy."}
{"text":"I've been back to Stumpys several times since my first visit.  The pizza is also pretty tasty.  The sausage, pepperoni, and mushroom is probably my favorite.  I've also had some more subs.  The meatball sub is pretty good but not the best I've had.  The bread was a little on the burnt side once but it still tasted good.  After trying both their subs and their pizzas I'd recommend the pizza.  Although, if you are in the mood for a sub you really cant go wrong.  AZ needs more family ran corner shops like Stumpys."}
{"text":"Only had two things here several times...Big dipper sandwich is really good.  It is basically a French dip with the bread covered in garlic butter.  Have had it a few times and have yet to get a fatty piece of gristle.  Other item has been 2 slice lunch special.  Get crumbled sausage and bacon.  Very fresh and can really taste every element.  Love it."}
{"text":"Listen, the pizza is amazing. Pizza is my absolute favorite food, and this pizza is better than any other pizza I've had before (quote me on it, I'll stand by it). But the pizza isn't what makes this place, it's the people.   A sign on the wall calls it a neighborhood joint. I love that humble neighborhood vibe. The walls are decorated with cards sent to the company, drawings from Girl Scout groups, pictures of people I assume are regulars and/or locals. The vibe is off the charts. More than that, I was lucky enough to bear witness to an event that restored my faith in humanity.   A man had come into the joint, asking for a cup of water, as he was down on his luck, homeless as far as Phoenix is concerned, as his family is in West Virginia and he has no way to get there. He didn't ask for anything more than a drink, but one of the employees asked him about himself a bit to reveal this information. She asked him to sit outside for a minute. She made him a loaded sub sandwich and she and another employee pooled enough cash together to afford him a greyhound ticket back to West Virginia. I am so deeply touched by the amazing kindness the people at Stumpy's share with their community.   If you're in the area, please give this place and it's people some love."}
{"text":"This place is a hole in the wall they have great pizza and salads. It was a small place but I would still say it was kid friendly."}
{"text":"I discovered Stumpy's in January when I moved to Altitude Sixteen 75.  I needed pizzas for the movers and the leftovers would be my dinner.  BEST pizza ever!  The ingredients are always very fresh, I love the sauce, and the crust is perfect.  Recently ordered the Hot Tuna Sub and it is also REALLY tasty!"}
{"text":"The friendliest place on earth!!!! Best sub I have ever had (club) and best pizza!!!!! Feels like family. Been coming here for 6 years."}
{"text":"Really friendly place and good food overall.  I ordered the baked ziti and it was just how I like it.  I'm not a huge fan of any red sauce but they mix in a lot of cheeses which gives it more of a blended flavor.  Usually when I see \"baked\" and \"pasta\" I expect a soft, mushy mess, but the ziti had a lot of firmness to it which is what I want.  I didn't get around to eating the garlic bread until an hour after I ordered and I was expecting a brick, but somehow it managed to say soft.  Nice bonus.  I got a slice as well to try it out.  They serve thin pizza, but I'm more of a thick crust person, but it was good overall.  The crumbled sausage is just what I like.  The staff was friendly and they seemed to be enjoying themselves.  Nice place to take a family."}
{"text":"A \"neighborhood joint\" that's closed on Sundays during football season???"}
{"text":"Great place to grab lunch. The portions are large, the food is fresh, and the prices are reasonable. The greek salad comes loaded with toppings and all the ingredients were fresh. Topping-wise, there was enough for two salads. I found the banana peppers (or peppercini, not sure) to be a little too astringent from the pickling juice stuff so if you are sensitive to that taste, order them on the side. The pizza is good as well - big slices, nice thin crust, flavorful sauce, and lots of gooey cheese."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza, slow as molasses.  That being said, everyone has a bad day.  This place is one of my favorites in Arizona.  Try the plain pepperoni (don't need to get too fancy, this is a winner).  Addon the antipasta sale, and \"suicide wings\" and you are good to guy.  For the courageous at heart - go with the Philly Cheesesteak pizza (a super surprising treat).  If you get delivery, don't forget to ask for parmesan and peppers (they never bring it no matter how much I tip - which is always very generous).  Oh well.  Have fun, and find your sizzle!

{"text":"Was really good. I got a calzone from here, it was tasty. They had a lot of traffic coming in and out, so they must be really known.  plus the customer service is extremely good."}
{"text":"The pizza was hand tossed but the crust was perfectly crispy! The flavors were perfect too. I had the small which fed me (Im a big guy) but could have fed 2 people. I also had a 6 piece of hot wings which were very good! I would deffinately go back here again."}
{"text":"If you're looking for the best Brooklyn style pie in Phoenix, this is it. Those other places...fugheddaboutit. My personal favorite is \"The Meats \" Pizza, although I've had \"The Works\" as well. ask for fresh garlic.  My kids love their pizza crisp and my wife loves the manicotti.  If you want wings and pizza try their Buffallo Bleu Cheese Pizza."}
{"text":"Stumpys has always ROCKED!!! As I write this I'm waiting for the White Out pizza to be delivered. A friend ordered pizza for us on Wednesday from here (First time trying the White Out) and I swear I've been dreaming about it ever since!!! Lol  I absolutely luv the owners, they used to do delivery for us when I worked at a neighborhood bar close by and gave us a discount for ordering for the bar. Again, always GREAT service,  and excellent food!"}
{"text":"Best ever!!! I brought my boyfriend here for the first time ever and he approved (he's the most critical about food) I've been a fan of this establishment since 2008... I've never come across anything I didn't like here. Love,love, love Stumpy's!"}
{"text":"2nd time here,  and the food is still good!  We tried the Greek pizza...I'm normally a carnivore,  but this would make me become a vegetarian.   Small place, big flavor,  will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"We were very loyal customers to this place. Started going many years ago and told people in our neighborhood. But never ever again. we always ordered wings, pizza, subs, and canoli's. Pick up and delivery. There was a sandwich in our delivery that didn't have anything it but the condiments, wings were not the amount we ordered. Called them up they told me to hang on and then I got disconnected which does happen so I called back and got the manager and he hung up the phone on me. No call back or anything when they had my number from the order. Live in the neighborhood and liked this place never ever again.  Such a big disappointment."}
{"text":"I've been getting delicious sandwiches from Stumpy's for about 15 years now. I really love the Italian Classic and the French Dip. Stumpy's represents the regions well! Its so good that my wife makes me stop and pick up something whenever I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The pizza is okay but their hot wings were horrible... I gave a 3 bcuz the pizza was decent not the best but would order pizza again... Just avoid the wings"}
{"text":"Best pizza there is! The wings are great, the sandwiches are great and don't forget the rice krispie treats, they're only there on some days"}
{"text":"Best Pizza around in my opinion. I order the works and the topping are awesome. The iced Tea is delicious as well."}
{"text":"We ordered from here last night and their pizza is insanely good!!! Total little hole-in-the-wall shop, with 9 people all working in a space the size of my kitchen; yet they produce such amazing food!! We got half whiteout, half Greek (with sausage sprinkled ax the entire pie) as well as breadsticks and hot wings. Everything was delicious!!"}
{"text":"Grabbed a pizza to go when we were staying in the area on vacation.  Pizza was very good, staff was friendly.   I would absolutely come back."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic. First of all I placed my order online. They called me in about 30 seconds to verify the order since my zip code for the credit card was out of state. Once I got there the food was ready in the time promised (they even held it for a few minutes once he learned I would be making another stop first). I took the food back to the hotel room and it was perfect. The order details (no tomatoes, certain cheese, ect...) they nailed it. No corners cut. The pizza slice my son got was fantastic and the subs my wife and I got were fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"I can't express how much I love this place.  Their pizza is so delicious and the customer service is excellent.  Stumpys is by far my favorite pizza place in the valley."}
{"text":"Very disappointed ordered a pizza and never got it, sadly I am not the only one this happened too."}
{"text":"In town for a few days. Ate here the first 2 nights. It's that good! Go, eat... find happiness in the first bite."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza. Try the works with Jalepenos! Carry out was quick and easy. Make this decision now!"}
{"text":"Tried pizza and wings at this place today. Pizza was acceptable (the works) but the wings were not that good, they seemed to be leftover wings from couple days ago. The person prepared my wing order doesn't know how to count to twelve because we  got 11 wings for the order of 12. Missing 1 bad wing was not a big deal but the feeling of your order was messed up when you checked it out at home was unpleasant. So if you ordered takeout, make sure you open your boxes and check before you leave."}
{"text":"Amazing pie! Baked wings, not fried! You can tell they use fresh ingredients all the way around. Great local neighborhood pizzeria. Stumpies 5 Star City!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches the best in town consistent for so many years at the same location never disappoints."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad pizza. Their crumbly sausage is so good and their service can't be beat. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Pizza crisp was amaz-balls. We also ordered The Works which the kids liked better.  I am from El Paso and we aren't really a pizza city so I may be easily impressed? But definitely recommend this place. Call in your delivery order, the on line ordering option needs some work. That said the girl who took my order was nice and the delivery driver was also cool and prompt"}
{"text":"This is our go-to place for pizza take out. It's pretty decent when you don't feel like getting dressed and venturing out into the world for a slice of modernized pizza that you find at other restaurants.   The staff is always friendly and the pies are priced fair."}
{"text":"I've never been disappointed with their food, and I have tried many items on the menu. My favorite though is there baked suicide wings. If you like spicy foods, you are going to love these! The toasted Italian sub is also a must. I would also like to mention that the sauce on their pizza is amazing.   The atmosphere is comfortably laid back, and they offer counter service and are very friendly. I use to live close enough for delivery, but now I will take the time to drive there, because it is so worth it."}
{"text":"Ive been here 1 times now and let me just say its one of the best pizzas ive ever had! So so so good and a decent price as well if you get one of their specials.  I just copied this review from someone else.. pretty much sums up how i feel"}
{"text":"Lately my husband and I have been on a major pizza kick... mainly, because we are neck deep in the throngs of moving our single lives into our newly combined life and newly purchased home and have zero energy or motivation to cook. we aren't even sure where the pots and pans are! Take out pizza always seems to prevail... lately. Being the foodies the way we are, we pick and order wisely. We peruse menus and almost treat this like a science experiment! Who do we turn to?? Yelp, of course! Stumpy's was this weeks choice for our pizza, as it's very near my loves office complex in North Phoenix. They have a great Italian and a great Pizza menu and salads too. You know, for that balance. We decided to order the Greek Salad , lots of Greek items like peppercini peppers, kalamata olives, green olives, feta cheese , sliced tomatoes and an amazing house dressing adorned the bed of lettuce. I kept dipping my pizza bones in it , it was so tasty! We ordered The Butcher as our 'to go' pizza. It is loaded with meats: pepperoni, salami, sausage, Canadian bacon and meatballs , ( although my 4 instead of 5 stars, is only because I didn't see the meatballs, and the sidenote on my note, I get that they aren't to be HUGE meatballs!.. but I saw none.At all!). We added mushrooms and this pie was almost pure perfection. The crust was good and crisp after we finished baking at home. Yes! Stumpy's is a rare pizza place that does a '3/4 bake' so that you can have fresh baked-ness at home! The crust had the perfect crisp and light garlic taste to it. We loved this pie and our salad, which was big enough to share generously! As far as our 'moving pizza addiction month' ... I guess that's what my workouts will be for next month! Should this move ever be over! Return factor.. completely a yes!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza joint in AZ. I come here all the time, and the service and food are always consistently great. At this point, they even know what I want when they see me, haha. I take everyone here, and I'd recommend that everyone try Stumpy's!"}
{"text":"Loooove the whiteout with bacon. Delicious. Probably come back for pizza for the rest of my life."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! First time going and now considered my favorite pizza joint now! Polite people with great customer service, I love how it's a small mom and pop joint, and it smells amazing and just tastes like heaven."}
{"text":"Stopped here and got the to slice meal of pepperoni and bacon. The pizza was awesome in the staff was friendly and helpful. please open one of these in Gilbert!!"}
{"text":"I've been a regular Stumpys customer for two plus years now, but that ends tonight.  Cold pizza delivered late, having to shout into the phone to give phone number and address, teen attitude when placing an order, and a general sense of we just don't care.   Sorry, I work hard for my money, and you won't be getting any more of it.  Oh and the management really needs to research customer service. Be humble when someone calls to complain; listen, correct it, move forward. Don't 'um' and 'yeah.' It may not be your life's work, but it IS someone's business. And hopefully they'll be reading this."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I decided to give this hole in the wall  place a try on 12/10/16 and boy I'm glad I did. This may be the BEST Italian grinder I ever had. I ordered the classic Italian cold, no onions and the Italian dressing on the side, one word  DELICIOUS  The bread is so fresh and the Italian dressing has that tangy kick to it! The service was prompt and friendly!   EVERYONE should give this place a try, especially if you are from the East Coast and miss Italian grinders. I know they call it \"classic\" and I'm not sure what the original recipe for Italian grinders is, but I know back home they use different deli meat. It's similar but BETTER!!!  1/13 Ordered a hot pastrami on Italian without onions and one word DELICIOUS!!!! 5 Stars   1/20  Ordered a small bacon and pepperoni pizza well done!  4 Stars  Oatmeal cookie - soft and delicious  5 Stars"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years when I got the craving for big slice style pizza or garlic bread. The garlic bread is some of my favorite here in the valley. Definitely some of the best pizza in the neighborhood! It's easy to miss being tucked back in a small strip mall, but this place is always busy making pizza. They offer delivery and pick up orders are always super fast if you want to swing by on your way home. I've never had their subs, but judging by the pizza I'm sure they are just as good. They also offer some homemade Italian pasta type items if that's what you're craving."}
{"text":"Always judge a pizza place by the simple cheese pizza.  This place was awesome, very quick, friendly, cheap and yummy.  I go here when I take my boys to Kumon next door, it is right off the 51 at Northern.  Highly recommend for a cheap, quality pizza."}
{"text":"Got into town yesterday and started looking for good places to eat.  This place had a lot of great reviews so we decided, why not!  Got a pizza and breadsticks.  BEST breadstick we have ever had. Pizza was really good but didn't come close to the breadsticks.  My only regret is that I hadn't had the last vodka drink because I want to remember more about dinner.  Lol. Not the cheapest pizza round, but definitely worth the price."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Pointe Squaw Peak for a staycation and wanted pizza. This place came up and sounded great! Pizza was delicious and the wings were yummy! We will definitely return again :)"}
{"text":"Food was great I would've given 5 stars but I got charged for 2 extra dressings & both were wrong. Also when I specifically ordered chx wings for my kids \"these are for my kids\" he could've told me that mild is still a little spicy. My spicy wings were great. Delivered to my hilton squaw peak room, no napkins, condiments or cutlery - whaaaat?  This wasn't dirt cheap & altho very tasty, a few pts off for customer service issues."}
{"text":"Where did the roast beef go? The roast beef last time tasted like it came from Subway. Gross!!  I used to love the hot roast beef sub.   I asked the guy to tunnel the bread, he didn't.   Excess lettuce and bread.   Employees lack personality."}
{"text":"Definitely a delicious choice for pizza and wings. I haven't tried their other menu items, but they have great menu options.  The wing sauce is very tasty. I like spicy bbq. The chicken wings are good and juicy. I like the pizza dough and they make it not too thick, not too thin, just right. I hate all pizza crust, but my dog devoured it without a problem. Nice sauce, quality toppings  I find this a great choice for pizza and I hope hope their dishes are as good as the pizza, but I'll have yet to try them before I can review."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza. It's a little crowded at lunch time, but overall a good place to get some good Italian food. I plan to return."}
{"text":"Me and my husband just had dinner here this evening. We walked in and everyone behind the counter was busy. But they weren't busy enough to greet us when we walked in. We took a look at their menu and decided we would share a medium pizza. We ordered the butcher pizza which had all the meats on it. I must say that the pizza was GOOD! The crust could be a little thinner and a little more sauce could be added. Then it would have been a GREAT pizza. The Italian sausage was very good along with the rest of the meats actually. I heard about this place from a friend of ours. We had just purchased a house in the area and was told by him to give it a chance. I'm glad we did as it was only $21 dollars for the medium butcher and 2 medium drinks. We can't wait to try out their delivery service since we are only 5 blocks away. Thank you stumpy's for a great first experience at your establishment. Ws"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza, good music, employees were nice, like that they have cookies also. Definitely would come back here"}
{"text":"Been looking for  real NY style pizza.  I found it at Stumpys.  Sauce is delicious!! Spicy BBQ wings are great!! They are baked not fried!! Prices are reasonable!! Busy place, staff were great!!  Order was quick."}
{"text":"I order pizza every week from this place, I call to explain that there is a wire in the pizza that my two year old had in his mouth & the manager hangs up on me for being upset... I will never order a thing from this place. Worse service in the world... to the manager I hope you feel good about yourself.   9/22/17"}
{"text":"Finally tried Stumpy's Pizza after hearing good things about the food. We like to support neighborhood businesses, so we gave the pizza delivery service a shot. We ordered \"the works\" pizza, Spicy BBQ wings, and the Veggie Calzone. All of the food was hot, delicious, and promptly delivered by a friendly face. Will definitely give Stumpy's another go in the future."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery from here. They were fast and friendly. The crust is bubbly and the base is nice and thin.  The pizza is not as greasy as other places. We reheated the left overs the next day in the oven and everything was still pretty tasty. This is a solid take out option."}
{"text":"Stumpys is the best pizza I've EVER eaten in Phoenix. Ive lived here 20 years. It is absolutely delicious. I  started a job in the strip mall and have been addicted every since. The sandwiches are also great,  because the meat is of such high quality. Yum. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Decided to stop here for my lunch today since I was craving a Meatball Sub. The Italian Bread was crunchy on the outside and chewy in the center (which I love). It's baked with the Mozzarella Cheese on it, and it melts all over the sandwich. Although, that makes the bread under the cheese kind of soggy which I didn't like, but the rest of it made up for this. Otherwise I'd have given Stumpy's 5 stars.  The meatballs were good and I could actually taste them. They don't douse the sub in marinara making it all soggy, which I also like. I barely finished my sub and I should have stopped eating it earlier but it was too good!  I was watching them make pizza in the back, and it looks like they make pizza slices to order. They even roll out the dough for each individual order. And like everyone else mentioned, they staff there was really polite and friendly. All said and done I spent $10, and felt like it was worth it. I'll be back, and next time I'll try their pizza.  UPDATED 5/22/12 - Had the meatball sub a 2nd time, and the bread was not soggy even with the extra cheese. I had a (3) slice of \"The Butcher\" pizza. Loved it. This place is extremely friendly, small, and good food. Updated from 4, to 5 stars."}
{"text":"Love this place!  I have been coming here for years now. Pizzas are fantastic and the staff is extremely friendly and fun!  If you're tired of trendy fads and are just craving a good old fashion mom and pop hearty pizza that out of this world, then you've found it!"}
{"text":"This place is where you're going to get the most bang for your buck in terms of both quantity and quality. Hands down, the closest to NY style pizza you can get in this part of town."}
{"text":"No stars!! Absolutely awful! Two weeks ago I called to order a pizza for my son from here because one of my friends said how amazing it was... LIES!! Not only did they charge my card with tip included, but they also charged my son when they delivered the pizza. (I was at work) when I came home I found out what happened and immediately called them, and never got a call back from the owner Chase like I told he was going to. I had to call back two days later, and finally talked to him. He then stated he would return the money for me as I deserved, because I only purchased one pizza. At the time I was understanding, but now two weeks later and still no refund. Then to find out he's been on vacation so that must mean he forgot.. I basically said I would stop by in person tomorrow and expect my refund in person. Not only have I had to deal with awful customer service, but I must say the pizza was not even good. Little Cesar's pizza is 100 times better including their customer service. Do not go there, and usually I am about supporting your local vendors, but not this one they break promises."}
{"text":"Pretty good and cheap. Staff are friendly. We ordered a pizza pepperoni and chicken salad. Good serving. Cute place. Would come back."}
{"text":"If you're looking for great pizza and something that's worth the money definitely go to Stumpy's and get their butcher Pizza it has all the meats there cheese is amazing there sauce is so good they're definitely a pizza place that we don't mind driving 20 to 30 minutes out of our way to get their food."}
{"text":"So I have tried a lot of pizza in the area and this was by far the best. The crust was cooked to perfection, thin and just the right crisp. The toppings were fresh, the cheese magical, and service was very friendly. The special of two slices and a drink was very affordable and came out fast on my lunch break. I will be back!"}
{"text":"We have tried The Whiteout, The Greek & the regular cheese pizza. All were very good. The Greek salad is very good as well. Highly recommend for take out or delivery. A must on Sunday night watching football."}
{"text":"Hubby and I were looking for a place to dine on a recent Friday night. The week had been long and we were weary so quick and easy was the plan. Found Stumpy's on Yelp and couldn't resist the opportunity to eat at a place with such a name! Plus pizza is our favorite food group.   The space is not very big but they were quite busy while we were there. We ordered a pizza to split and grabbed a table. All the workers there were friendly and seemed to genuinely enjoy being there. Even late on a Friday night.   Everything smelled wonderful and we drooled over a couple of sandwiches we saw. Our pie came quickly and was just the right size for sharing. The crust was crispy with a chewy-ness - not quite a thin crust but not a thick crust either. The flavor of the sauce was good, not overly sweet or spicy, a happy medium. The amount of cheese and toppings was just right. It was not my favorite pizza pie of all time but  I do think it might be my new #2 for pizza in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"We decided it was Pizza night...and Stumpy's won. All I can say is thank goodness it did. It was our first time trying them out and YELP says they are worth it..so we went ahead with a large Works pizza.   The pizza was outstanding! It arrived on time and hot. It was loaded with plenty of toppings with the perfect amount of sauce. We will be ordering again real soon. Im glad I have leftovers...lunch 2mrw..maybe breakfast..lol"}
{"text":"The hot Italian sub sandwich keeps me coming back. The anti pasta salad with chicken is a good portion. Sometime I take my food up the dreamy draw park which is about 300 yards east on 16th street and park and eat at the picnic area for some peace and quiet reflection.   I've never had the I pizza because I always get that hot Italian  Tiny place.  Give it a try..."}
{"text":"Awesome...pizza!!! Crispy crust and melty cheese!!! Perfect pizza and a great family atmosphere. Employees are nice and pizza is great! Shout out to Margie for being so nice to my son with Autism. Will definatley be coming back ."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times now and I was hooked at first bite. Everything so far has been delicious. The whiteout pizza is one of my favorites as well as the hot subs. So far I've tried the veggie and Italian. Both were awesome! I'll be coming back for more! For those ordering delivery, you might want to skip getting a hot sub because mine was soggy on the bottom. Next time I'll eat there or pick up myself, which is no big deal. The staff is very nice."}
{"text":"So far so good. I stopped in today to get a sandwich on the go and I have to tell you the menu looks pretty nice. I ended up getting a pastrami hot with provolone on Italian bread and it was so delicious. I know if they don't have pre made pizzas ready to go, they only have pies with sauce and then they put the toppings on as you order. The pizza oven is one of those conveyor belt type which I'm not crazy about. But the slices that were coming out for other customers looks pretty delicious. I'll have to come back and try to pizza you're going to have to be pretty damn good cause I'm spoiled when it comes to pizza. So if you're in the area, give something to try. Let me know how good the pizza is."}
{"text":"Love the pizza! Prices are very reasonable. I would suggest calling in your order prior to arrival due to how busy they can get- but even still the staff are always very kind."}
{"text":"From out of town, I was look for a good take out Pizza and I was not disappointed. Fresh mushrooms, good hand tossed crust, just the right amount of sauce. Well done. Good price also. Service was good. Definetly recommend."}
{"text":"We ordered Stumpy's for delivery last night based on a coupon we had. Ordered one pepperoni pizza to be delivered about one mile. They told us it would be about 45 minutes to an hour. At an hour and 20 minutes we called to check status and they told us they weren't sure what was going on or where their driver was. They told us they would give a discount on the next order. The driver showed up at the two hour mark with our pizza. The pizza was okay, but would not order again because of the service."}
{"text":"driving down northern we saw this place and decided to give it a shot. the place is VERY small inside but luckily the weather was nice so we were able to eat at a table outside.   The sauce was really good and so was the cheese,  the pepperoni was really good also.  the pizza was cooked just perfect, not soggy, not too crunchy, i wish it was closer."}
{"text":"How could you not love this place!!! Amazing pizza, amazing staff, wonderful customer service! Thank you all!! If you haven't tried it, please do!"}
{"text":"The best pizza I have had in a long time. I give it 4 stars because the area it is in is hard to find and somewhat shady. We ordered a pineapple, bacon, feta pizza. Even though it took me a while to find this place (my fault. Forgot phone and had to return home to Mapquest), the crust was crisp and the pizza was perfect! 5 stars if you open a location further north or expand ur delivery area."}
{"text":"lov the delivery an i mean they really deliver the best food !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Stumpy's is awesome. I used to go here a lot more often when my boyfriend lived just up the road. He's moved to the south end of Phoenix so it's no longer convenient to go to Stumpy's, but I crave it all the time and hope to go back soon.  Love their pizzas! The only pizza I've eaten from there that I didn't completely love was the Philly Cheese Steak pizza. An interesting idea that suffered a bit in reality, I thought. Their other pizzas are great though! If you're not in a pizza mood, their hot sandwiches are amazing as is their chicken salad. Definitely get it with the house dressing, this was the best chicken salad I've ever had!!  The guys that work there are very friendly and always remember the regulars and treat them like old friends. Check this place out if you're in the area, or make a special trip if you're not nearby. It's worth it!"}
{"text":"This is good food. Staying at the hilton close by and found this on Yelp. The two Pizzas we ordered were fresh, good toppings, great crust and delicious. The baked Ziti with meatballs was a huge hit and the two salads were huge, full of meats and cheeses and we had lots of leftovers. Definitely will be back on my next visit to Phoenix."}
{"text":"I have only been there once, but man! It's one of the best little hole in the wall places in that area! I wouldn't call the food good...I would call it addicting! I can't wait to go back there with my man! If you haven't gone there, you should. At least once. It's an adventure!!! Go!"}
{"text":"My last few experiences were great.  I ordered online, and they arrived by the suggested arrival time.  This time, was very different.  30 minutes past the suggested arrival time, still no pizza and wings.  I called and the employee I spoke with blamed the fact that I ordered online.  She said that the \"computer\" doesn't know how busy they are, she tried to say they are limited on drivers during the week. I quickly pointed out, that the orders I have placed have only been during the week.  She was not a good example of customer service.  The owner/manager is the only responsible party but he doesn't work past 5. So no one to talk to.  I was told that the food should be excellent.  This was the first time that the pizza was cold and the wings were soggy.  She got down to my level, and that was great.  She had some redemption there.  But I am concerned about a business that uses a \"service\" for their online orders, that does not know what is going on at the location.  I am not sure if I will give them another shot.  I feel really let down, compared to the past experiences.  I have ordered pizza from a competitor nearby for years, never had such a problem.  So who knows.  Stumpy's needs to take ownership, even if it is a third party doing their online service."}
{"text":"Stumpy's is friggin delicious. Their pizza, subs (had turkey and French dip) and wings are all good. Fast delivery and easy pickup. Our new go to pizza spot in midtown."}
{"text":"I showed up at 9:15 after I got off work.  Stumpy's was closed but the door was open.  I was perfectly fine with being turned away, but to my surprise the young man working there offered to make me a pizza.  I have always loved Stumpy's pizza, but their willingness to go the extra mile to make me a pizza after they closed was awesome.  I will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Had cheese and sausage with onion pizza. Crust was limp and doughy. Italian salad was average. Not my kind of pizza"}
{"text":"Looking at all the great reviews I was excited to try Stumpy's. I don't know if we went on an off day or what but after our dinner, I can't join the accolades party.  My guy and I ordered a large pizza - half whiteout, half pepperoni and ricotta, and an order of breadsticks. We ordered pick up on a Saturday night and they quoted us 35 minutes.  We started with the breadsticks. They were okay. Lots of garlic and parmesan topping and they come with sauce for dipping. I guess I was just hoping for a softer breadstick. This was more like the pizza crust.   Next up was the pizza. The whiteout had huge chunks of ricotta. Some people might be into that but it was too much for me. Otherwise, I just thought it was kinda blah. The other half with the pepperoni was definitely better but again, nothing that really blew us away.  When we were done we both felt just kinda bloated and gross. I mean I realize I'm not eating salad here but it was too heavy and greasy for us. I don't think we'll be back."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch, wasn't really expecting much. We were very surprised. Despite the look the pizza was amazing. Super thin and crunchy crust with a good marinara.  We were lucky with the time we arrived because there wasn't a line but as soon as we ordered there was a line all the way to the door.   It is a little pricey but still worth trying if you're in the area."}
{"text":"We had the 24 pc BBQ wings and a large pepperoni and jalapeño pizza for 27.99 + 3.60 for the extra toppings ( jalapeños and pepperoni). The wings were ordered hot double baked BBQ, and I must say they were pretty good, I'll definitely other them in the future. The BBQ sauce had a touch of spice and the wings were a bit crunchy, and made a great combination. The pizza we order was okay... I will not be ordering a pizza with those toppings in the future.   The cook recommended to order a cheese calzone, and boy was that good! I ordered both calzones and the cheese one was a hit, the other one would not be order again, the reason was because it had pepperoni , veggies and bacon, and it overpowered the taste of the cheese plus it tasted very similar to a pizza.   Their customer service is great! It was our second time there and they remember my boyfriend's last order. The cashier was very kind and helpful as well ."}
{"text":"Delicious and fast. Thin crust with generous toppings, baked up crisp. Outside seating was nice to have."}
{"text":"Great pizza and wonderful staff! I love their house italian dressing for their salads!"}
{"text":"When I first moved to the Phoenix area, a co-worker directed me to this place. I had an amazing club sandwich on the freshest bread possible. Despite telling everyone how delightful it was and driving by frequently, for years I never went back! Fortunately, my husband and I moved relatively close and are lucky enough to be within their delivery area.   Our first delivery consisted of The Greek pizza and The Big Dipper sandwich. Our second, The Big Dipper. The third, The Big Dipper. Seeing a trend here? The Big Dipper is amazing. It's sliced Roast Beef, Smoked Provolone, Garlic Butter, and Au Jus all toasty and warm. We've also had their Homemade Meatballs and Garlic Toast with Mozzerella and Marinara. The meatballs definately satisfied a craving, and while the sauce really makes the meatballs, I thought the beef was a little dry. The garlic toast was highly addictive and we've ordered it again.   I would recommend Stumpy's to anyone and everyone. Sure, it's tucked away next to my dentist and doesn't look like much from the outside (or inside) but the food is delicious. Also, the employees are friendly and look happy. The best part is that Stumpy's is a local business!"}
{"text":"Sooooo good. Amazing pizza, but right now I'm addicted to their manicotti.  I love supporting Mom and pop shops, this one will forever get my business. Employees are also friendly. Only bad thing, very small place. Not many seats to eat there. I always just get it to go. With that being said, they have never screwed my order up. If you haven't eaten here and been wanting to, do it. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Hilton for the weekend and found Stumpys on Yelp and decided to try it out.  I was impressed with the online ordering as it was easy to order and allowed me to choose the time I wanted to take delivery of dinner.  It was 3 pm at the time of my order and I specified 5 pm for the delivery.  This would give them plenty of time to plan to get my order on time.  At 5:35 there was a knock at the door and it was the Stumpys delivery guy.  He handed us a few bags and brought out a pizza.  We ordered two large pizzas (a black olive and a ham and pineapple) and an order of 12 breadsticks.  We were given one ham and pineapple pizza, a salad and medium chicken wings.  I told the delivery guy that we had another pizza coming and we didn't order a salad or wings.  He said that he would be right back and left.  He was nice and apologized.  I think that he was new and just trying to figure things out.  I called the store and let them know.  They apologized and said that they would send out a whole new order and pick up what they dropped off.  I told them that wasn't necessary.  I just wanted my black olive pizza and breadsticks.  Frankly, the wings were stinking up the room and I wanted them gone but the kids were excited to get an unexpected treat.  The delivery guy came back with the black olive pizza and breadsticks.  All this by 4:55 pm.  So, they were still on time and the pizza and breadsticks were awesome!  I would definitely order from them again since they handled the mistake so well and their pizza was great!"}
{"text":"We made a big order (8 pizza's, salads, breadsticks) for a family party - all online using their website.   Stumpy's came thru wonderfully - the order was on time, accurate, and most importantly, the food was great! Everyone loved the food, from children thru adults."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and GO TO STUMPYS!!   Seriously this is why I love Yelp! Finding small, local places to eat that are off the charts!   Unassuming, in a nondescript strip mall, but as soon as we walked in, and I smelled the sauce, I knew I was in for something good!   The employees were all super friendly, giving recommendations, getting our order to the line fast. Our food was out pretty quick, considering it was during the lunch rush and everything is made fresh.   Our group got a few different slices and we all loved them! Thin, crispy crust, flavor packed sauce, fresh cheese, awesome toppings. The pizza was so, so good! They even offered to cut my kids slices into small pieces to make it easier for them to eat, which was so nice!   I love that they offer slices, but make them fresh, sauce, cheese, and toppings, instead of reheating slices of a premade pizza like other places.   Our group left all giving it 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Ok, I went back and I had the BBQ Chicken Pizza.  I added bacon.  It was completely and ridiculously delicious.  The chicken was tender, juicy and delicious.  It tasted like it had just come right off the grill!!!  I absolutely recommend trying the specialty pizzas.  This place is great and a treasure in my local area!"}
{"text":"this place is the bomb!!  one of the best pizza places in town, the food is always great, and the staff is the best as well, JoJo, Gus, Oscar, delivery driver gal, and the rest, great people, great food, this place should be 5 stars, shame on those who gave it less."}
{"text":"I LOVE Stumpy's I have eaten here for the last 12 years and have not had one bad thing. The best thing on the menu is the hot Italian sub! Their house dressing is amazing!! Also don't forget the chocolate chip cookie; best cookie I have bought at a pizza/sub place; soft in the center and crispy on the edges.  You Gotta try it all!!"}
{"text":"Great local pizza.  Not as fast or cheap as a chain but worth the wait and expense.   If you can pick it up that is the best and fastest.  I would not recommend ordering on line as on two different occaisions, my online order was not noticed until I called wondering why my pizza had not arrived.   The cannoli are stuffed to order and quite delicious - I haven't had one that good outside of the East coast.   Now, if only they were open on Sunday, I wouldn't have to ever go anywhere else for Pizza."}
{"text":"The work crew loves getting lunch from Stumpys! The sandwiches are bomb, do yourself a favor and trying one with the Chipotle mayo. My personal fave is the hot pastrami. Great bread, the meat is not fatty like some places and the toppings are right on. Service is always fast and friendly. Keep it up stumpys!"}
{"text":"Ordered a takeout order online to be ready at 7:55 show up at 8:00 to pick it up and they were just putting it in the oven... It was ready at 8:20. They didn't even apologize. Overpriced for such bad service. I won't be eating here again."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best Hot Italian Sandwich I have ever had. Great service, the location is not the best but the owner here also owns 13 North in the same little shopping center. (Go there BTW!!) I had enjoyed Stumpy's Pizza in the past but never the sub. Had an opportunity to drop in and am very glad I did. If you like a hot italian cold cut sub go get this!!"}
{"text":"This place should definitely have all the stars it does. I've eaten here so many times and I have never been unhappy. I'm not going into specifics about what I have eaten because you should get whatever sounds good to you. You'll like it and it will be served with a friendly attitude and a smile. The people here treat everyone like family. I always look forward to coming."}
{"text":"Went in recently for lunch and it was my first time at Stumpy's. I ordered a chicken salad and have some food sensitivities so I asked the girl who took my order if the dressing had oregano in it. She said no, none of the dressings have oregano. I discovered my sensitivity through a blood test, and now if I have anything with oregano I experience dizziness and just feel out of sorts.  I ate the salad, which was fine...nothing spectacular, but it was a good salad. As I waited for my daughter to finish, I started to experience dizziness. I asked the cook if there was oregano on the chicken. She said yes, and there was oregano in the dressing as well. I told her that the cashier told me there wasn't, and her response was, \"Oh, she's new..she doesn't know.\" Another cook said to both me and the cashier, \"This is an Italian restaurant. There's oregano in everything.\" No apologies, no concern...nothing. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"We had Stumpy's on vacation In Phoenix over Thanksgiving. They are right down the road from our hotel (Hilton Pointe) and my husband went for pick-up after we came down with the crud on our last day there.   I had a single slice, and my husband and son devoured the rest of the pizza. One month later, my husband is STILL talking about that pizza. It is the sauce that is compared to all others. Even the local Italian joint suffers in comparison.   So if you want to get a pizza that you'll be talking about weeks, even months later, go to Stumpy's. I can't vouch for the service or even the other food, but the pizza will be once in a lifetime."}
{"text":"I'm new to the area and the area of Phoenix that I used to live had a terrible selection of pizza delivery.  Since I've moved over here I've made it a point to take advantage of the choices I have.  I absolutely love Stumpys, I've ordered from there several times now.  Their wings are great and their pizza and service is better.  I will be back."}
{"text":"A local eatery recommended by a neighboring business. I tried to order two slices to go and was told all slices are made to order; no ready made pizzas;  please choose from the menu. Hmm. Waited approximately 8 minutes and boy was it worth it!  Fresh delicious ingredients, crispy oven fresh. Bustling (it was noon rush) but very friendly staff. We will order again, probably for delivery next time. Competitive prices. Definitely an superior alternative to the traditional franchises."}
{"text":"We looked this place up on our way to our friends' house in the area and decided to give it a shot. Four out of four of us thought it was excellent. Great sauce, great crust, and fresh toppings. Plus, I love what they've done in such a tiny little shop space. This struck me immediately as an independent little neighborhood joint with pride of ownership. I just wish it was easier to spot when driving by."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza spots! Regular crust AND gf crust are the bomb! Pizza is flavorable , perfect balance of cheese and toppings, and the (side) salads are generous."}
{"text":"Came here from California based on other reviews online and we're pleased with the pizza the meatballs and friendliness of the staff. Would recommend anyone to Stumpys the pizza was great kids loved it"}
{"text":"Ordered the pizza lunch special online. Very Convenient! I popped up about 20 minutes early and the woman was very welcoming and told me not to worry as they were going to get the order out early. This place usually gets busy, however, I came before the rush and I got to sit at a table comfortably inside. Customer service was excellent. The pizza was delicious and my two slices were huge!!!"}
{"text":"Live right down the street from this gem. Recently ordered the Lasagna after getting food here for years, it is heavenly! Top 3 I have ever had in my life! If you order it comes in a metal tin baked to perfection. Plus they split it in 2 when you get it, and trust me, it will feed 2 people. I also think they use ground beef and sausage in there. Comes with garlic bread. Just fantastic!"}
{"text":"Ive been here 4 times now and let me just say its one of the best pizzas ive ever had! So so so good and a decent price as well if you get one of their specials.  I got the special that comes with 2 slices and 2 toppings with a medium drink. I got bacon and pepperoni which was AMAZING. The pizza is so fresh and cripsy i could eat it everyday. I CRAVE this pizza all the time and im not really a pizza person. They have ranch which is extra but so worth it. Its more of a garlic ranch but not overpowering, but i love garlic so the hint of it doesnt bother me.  My mom got the special with a sub and a drink which she enjoyed. She likes her bread crispy but not burnt. They did that perfectly.   Sydney was amazing at answering our questions and had a great customer service atittude. She made our experience worth it. My mom is a hard person to please and can be very harsh when judging food or the customer service and she was even pleased with everything.  Its small inside with some seating outside, if you have a large group it wouldnt really work out. Its cute and homey inside with oldies playing."}
{"text":"This pizza was great!  You can order the lunch menu 2 slices (huge) whichever way you want.  You can do the specialty pet slice and it's made to order not just sitting under a light.  I got the chicken and blue cheese one and also the all meat one.  Very good crust and toppings were of high quality.  Well done Stumpys!"}
{"text":"Any place that tries their best to remember your name is tops in my book.   Don't get turned off by the strip mall location as most of the eateries in Phoenix are in the same boat.  It's just off the 51 @Northern so it's in a great location (driving wise).  If you are in the know, the joint is owned by the same guy who just opened Thirteen North restaurant a few doors west in the same plaza.  On to the food itself, my usual order in this place as my family swears by it is the whiteout pizza (ricotta, mozzarella, romano, garlic, tomato and fresh basil) baked on a freshly tossed dough.  Amazing.  We had the chicken wings as well as hot roast beef sub on italian bread before and we were quite pleased.  Yes, you can always go to Bianco, Parlor, Cibo for some fancy artisan pizza but for the value:taste ratio, my money is on Stumpy's.  A great neighborhood pizza joint."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza I have ever eaten! It's a whole in the wall but trust me you want to go there.   They load the toppings, sauce tastes so good and the crust is perfect. All the toppings are so fresh.  I like a thin crust which isn't on the menu but if you ask they will make it.   Pizza is my favorite food so I know what im talking about - try stumpys!"}
{"text":"Went here after bookmarking this place on yelp and I have to say my pizza was great. I called prior to coming to ensure they accepted Amex (which they did) even though it was a busy Friday night the woman that answered the phone was polite and pleasant. Once we arrived I order the family deal which is a large cheese pizza and 24 wings.. I added pepperoni to the entire pizza and bacon and sausage to half, my wings I wanted extra crispy and was kind of leery to even order them after seeing their wings were baked and not fried, total for everything was $33. My wings arrived just like I asked and the pizza was excellent. We opted to stay and eat in and the experience was pleasant, no rude employees or customers. So glad I listened to help on this one and this is definitely worth the drive and our new go to spot. I totally had every intention on talking pics but once the pizza came all my intentions went out the door lol."}
{"text":"So good. Cheese pizza for my kids and it was a hit.  I got the Italian sandwich and it was amazing!  Coming back for that again!!  The crispy bread was very garlicky but still yummy!!"}
{"text":"Their Italian Sub is BEST IN CLASS. Good Pizza, but great sandwiches. Friendly staff, including the cooks. Asked me if I was enjoying the food. It is a small and lackluster setting, but the food is why you'll keep coming back. This is my second time here this week, both times were between busy times. And still there was a steady stream of people, both eating in and taking out. Service was super fast, I bet the really crank it out at meal times."}
{"text":"Visiting for work in the Phoenix area decided to order pizza and wings to our hotel we always love thin crust style New York Pizza we are definitely Foodies the pizza and the wings were absolutely amazing would order daily with no problems it's a must-try if you're in the area and want a quick fix for some good pizza and wings"}
{"text":"I love whole in the wall pizza joints....great slices...friendly staff...fast...and quite fulfilling"}
{"text":"Service wasn't that great. Table I sat at was dirty. It took them about 10 minutes to get me a side salad that I had ordered with a slice of pepperoni pizza. The salad had fresh ingredients. Pretty good. The pizza was alright, it was crispy and the cheese was tasty."}
{"text":"We come here pretty regularly. They have a really good selection of pizza and subs that are delicious. Most recently I've been devouring there chicken salad. It's a garden salad with chicken on it. You have to try the house dressing, it's amazing."}
{"text":"This place is always busy, when you try it you will know why. They do Pizza and they do it right! Their sliced sausage is great and sauce and cheese are perfect."}
{"text":"My second son Charlie was fed a diet of Stumpys Pizza's and Subs while in-utero, so much in fact, that I probably should've named him Stumpy.    Pros & Cons:  Pros:  Best pizza ever. Great crust, super light.  Great cheese, yes, the quality of cheese matters.  Sauced perfectly and topped accordingly.  It's really an art people.    Best subs.   Really big subs, you can share, but you're not going to want to.  Best wings:  I've always maintained a wing should be fried, not baked.  They bake their wings here and they are the best wings I've ever had.  Their wing sauce is amazing... super garlicky with just enough kick.  Cons: I live outside of their delivery area.  Oh wait, that's my fault.  Actually they are closed on Sundays.  Really cramps my pizza style."}
{"text":"Meh- too many toppings in comparison with sauce and dough. I realize that sounds crazy but the end result was all topping to the point of it not seeming like a pizza but more like a bunch of meat and veggies piled on a bit of cheese with a little sauce. You can't even fold it and eat it without everything falling out all over the place.   I prefer Spinattos."}
{"text":"What happens on a cold December night is nobody's business but mine! But in case you're curious, my face is stuffed with the \"works\" pizza.....soooo good! And my husband absolutely loves the \"bob's\" wings. It's one of the best places to eat pizza in Phoenix."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery while staying at a resort near here. Got the barbecue chicken pizza and a mushroom pizza. Both were fantastic, service was quick, and friendly! Loved it!!"}
{"text":"There is no bad pizza...  I just moved to Phoenix from Brooklyn, so what do I go for on the first night I'm here? I go for a taste of home. I go for some 'za.  I was on my way to the grocery store, and you should never wander the aisles on an empty stomach, and Stumpy's 2 slices + medium drink combo for under $7 did me right.  I asked for pepperoni & sausage, and the guy at the counter asked me if I want crumbled or sliced sausage. They don't usually have a choice at most pizza shops, and if you get asked this question, ALWAYS opt for crumbled.  Pizza is pretty good here and the customer service was amazing. I thought for a second, that I was back at Vinny's in Greenpoint, because of the atmosphere and the friendly people working here.  I have a carryout/delivery menu from Stumpy's but it's nice to dine in or sit outside on a cool evening, too!"}
{"text":"This is about the best pizza in Phoenix. The crust is just crispy enough, the toppings are good and plentiful, the staff are friendly and helpful. Only the ambiance is a problem; it is crowded pizza joint decor and the tables are very close together. The prices are excellent given the quality. We do a Butcher's Special (meat lover) with added ricotta. It is as good a pizza as I've ever had. There is ample parking, but their few outdoor tables are on the sidewalk of that parking lot, so it's a mixed blessing. I usually have a side salad to make believe that I'm eating healthy. The ice tea is way better than most. We don't eat pizza often, but when we do, this is one of our favorite places. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"A true Sunnyslope gem. Im not even kidding when I say we order atleast once a week.... Pizza is phenomonal and the wings are GREAT! We have had one run in with an employee being rude but, Mrs. Stumpy messaged us on yelp and we great about it! We appreciated it. There can be long delivery times but, thats because, ITS SO GOOD EVERYONE WANTS IT! Im telling you amazing. A lot cheaper than spinatos and a lot more (If you're in the area and can't pick) Delivery is cheap too so we don't even have to leave! We came in for lunch one day and the cashier who was a lady (Amber? Amanda?) Can't remember but, was SO Nice!"}
{"text":"The only reason that I had for stopping at Stumpy's is that it's on the way to an Xmas party where I had to bring something \"to share\".  I call ahead and by the time I'm passing by the pizza is done.  Haul it to the party and everybody's happy.  Good pizza and staff, obviously not controlled by an evil corporation."}
{"text":"Just found my #2 pizza spot...  I worked the holidays and one of our vendors brought in Stumpys Pepperoni Combo Cheese Hawaiian All were very good, decent crust cooked through and not cardboard :-o// the pepperoni was really good with the extra grease/oil, not over bearing but delicious. I will try their Subs next,,, its a little far from the office, but should be worth a trip to get out.  YAY !!! ITSA GOODA PIE!!"}
{"text":"Do not order online. I ordered and got a confirmation email of my order.  An hour after they were supposed to deliver, I called and they said they didn't see my order.  Too many other pizza places around to have bad service. Bye bye Stumpy's ! I will go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Just had the hot Club Sandwich on white. Killer. Perfectly balanced, moist, but not sloppy. Perfection for the price."}
{"text":"Love this place I had their pizza for the first time about 2 months ago when a friend ordered through delivery.  I ordered from here at least once a week I only wish they delivery area covered more of the Downtown Phoenix area."}
{"text":"The pizza is awesome! The chef salad was great! Only reason I couldn't give 5 stars is because when I was ordering on the phone it was unorganized and a long wait to order and a really long delivery time. I ended up just picking it up and that was fine. Nice people but not great on the phone. But the pizza made up for all that! Glad I yelped this place."}
{"text":"Delicious! I love the side salad the ranch is not a cheap and taste good and the double baked double dipped wings are my favorite! The pizza is pretty good too! I haven't tried a sub yet so that will be on my order!"}
{"text":"Good pizza, nice people, great rock and roll. Coupons, too. What more can you ask?"}
{"text":"Solid place for lunch pizza slices.  I live and work close and this is our go to takeout pizza place.  I have had the meatballs and the sauce was tasty.  No frills good neighborhood pizza place.  I haven't tried the subs and wings but will update when I do.  They look good.  I have been here a dozen times and consistently good. Everyone is very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Being new in town, I called maybe my second day for delivery. I ordered their French dip and absolutely loved it. We stopped by the other night and grabbed a pie of pizza. As a born and raised New Yorker, I'm pretty judgmental on pizza and am very picky.   Although I haven't seen claims of Stumpy's modeling their pizza after NY pizza like most business do out here (and epically fail), I think their pizza is phenomenal and definitely the best in town. It may not be New York-good as far as my absolute favorite places in NY, but very close and comparable to the pizza I grew up eating. For a great price this is definitely my go-to neighborhood pizza and sandwich place!"}
{"text":"We were visiting from out of town and decided to order Stumpy's from our hotel room. Delivery was very fast and it was hot. Delivery guy was very friendly and came right to our door - bonus!  The pizza was flavorful and crispy and the sub was also very good.  Sub was on fresh bread and portion size was huge - enough for 2.  This was one of the best pizzas I have ever tasted and I would order it every week if i could. STUMPY'S IS AWSOME!"}
{"text":"Tasty pizza! place is a little rough to get in and out of on a lunch hour though"}
{"text":"A great local pizza, with a thin foldable crust and an interesting choice of cheese. Still not quite 5 star worthy, as this pizza does have more than its fair share of grease, but worth repeat business."}
{"text":"Great Pizza for the money. Love the crunchy crust. Great flavor to the sauce. I always ask for extra sauce and they add on with no problem. Only downer is there is not much room to dine in. Great dive pizza joint."}
{"text":"We stayed at the Hilton Squaw Peak and dug around our Entertainment book for local coupons. Stumpy's Pizza was Saturday night's winner and it was damn good. We had a B1G1 pizza so did a half & half for the first one (Medium 1/2 Hawaiian and other 1/2 canadian bacon and onions) and the other pizza, a small Philly Cheese Steak. The pizza toppings were plentiful for both pizzas and the crust was very good. It was enough food for the four of us with leftovers, too. On top of that, they make fresh baked giant chocolate chip cookies that I am still salivating over. Ugh, so good. This was a good local pizzeria that beats out the typical delivery spots. Speaking of delivery, apparently they do, too! I wonder if they make it down to 7th and Osborn????"}
{"text":"I have a passion for great pizza.  It's been my favorite food since I was a kid. I've outgrown my fondness for the typical pep & sausage as my tastebuds have been seeking out new flavors. The first time I tried the Gourmet White Pizza at Stumpy's I believe I heard the chorus to Hallelujah! Another favorite of mine is the Hot Blue Chicken Wing Pizza...an explosion of flavorful deliciousness! So good...I am actually salivating over my keyboard just thinking about it! Anyway...Stumpy's is by far one of my most favorite pizza places. Another giant plus? The owners and staff are the most amazingly friendly people I have ever met. They greet everyone with a warm smile and a wonderful pizza!"}
{"text":"Nice crust, not the best I've ever had though. I like the option that you can either order the whole pizza or just by the slice. I was looking for a thin crust pizza so the lady recommended to order it by the slice. I built my own with pepperoni, 2 kinds of cheeses, artichokes, and jalapeño. It was very good. They make every pizza upon order, so it doesn't sit there for hours and hours. I'll come back eventually."}
{"text":"We really love your pizza.  As NC Phoenix residents, you stole our business from Raffaelles.  But your order takers can never hear, and I have to yell into the phone.  That's fine I guess, but tonight, when the order was incorrect, I got the \"sassiest\" girl on the phone I think I've ever had, who explained that I had repeated my order to her, and, furthermore, I got what I ordered.  Unless she has a beehive wig and is chewing a big wad of gum, I am not interested in her perspective.  Great delivered pizza.  Wrong order.  Guest service from 17 year olds who don't give a crap, at least this time.  You can do better."}
{"text":"Stumpy's has some of the best Phoenix pizza I've ever had it's hard to find a good pizza joint and not end up going to dominoes or Pizza Hut but let me tell you ping the two extra bucks for this pizza is well worth it fresh ingredients quick service I recommend this to anyone that's in the area for lunch or dinner I've also had their subs and they're also very good"}
{"text":"Wings outta this world!! Pizza was delicious but the topping can easily slip right off the crust"}
{"text":"Stayed a few blocks away at a hotel on business. I like to do the local thing when I'm away from home so I looked for a local hike (dreamy draw was awesome) and I ALWAYS have local pizza.  Stumpys was awesome. Generous toppings, awesome crust, fast delivery. Good stuff. If I come back and stay all the way on the other side of town, I will drive back here for another pie. Got a half works, half cheese and jalapeño. Never did that before. Definitely doing it again.  On another night I went to SNY just to get some variety and perspective on Phx area pizza and it was a total let down. Stumpys was closed so I had no choice but next time, I won't deviate from the best. I may even try one of the highly recommended specialty ones."}
