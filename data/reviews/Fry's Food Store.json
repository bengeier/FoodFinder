{"text":"Im not sure what store Ana S (below me) was shopping at but this store does not have a Starbucks and is not deserving of anything more than 2 stars...and the 2nd star is mainly due to its location to where i live. I have pulled up and seen homeless guys sleeping towards the east end of the building. More than once i have been approached in the parking lot for spare change. The security guards i have seen look  like they just were dropped off the short bus. Now lets go inside! It seems as though this store is not as well stocked as the two stores closest to it. The deli staff is either retarded or trained to be rude and stupid. The whole feel of the store is \"dont touch that it looks sticky\". If i need something quick it is the obvious choice....otherwise i drive the extra couple of miles to go to the one on Camelback and the 51."}
{"text":"They close all the checkout lanes every night around 10pm and force everyone to use self-checkout. Some people aren't really bright enough to use these and the lines get very long. The place is dirty and the Target in the same shopping center is a much better choice, and Target has grocery now."}
{"text":"i moved here from the east coast and was surprised that a lot of things i was accustomed to buying i would no longer be able to get in arizona. i came into the store a week ago and met a grocery manager named \"hector\" who was determined to be able to assist me. the item was \"knors  vegetable seasoning something i used a lot of when making spinach and artichokes dip. i want someone in the company to know that \"hector \" did everything he could to assist me and restored my faith in your company. also i would like to salute \"jose\" and the manager in the meat department. i can't remember his name but i can tell you that they have been nothing but helpful to me each and every time i've had a question the knowledge of where the seafood comes from to assisting me with general questions. i salute \"hector, jose, and the manager they have each shown that they don't just do a job they love the job they do."}
{"text":"Overall this place gets 2 stars due to the deli section.  Horrible wait time and unreliable.  The deli workers refuse to acknowledge you and leave you standing there while it seems like they try to ignore you.  Very unhappy with the customer service."}
{"text":"Cleaner than your typical grocery store in Phoenix and do not have to worry about many kids running around (Walmart lol)"}
{"text":"I'm a new senior. I love this store on 1st Tuesdays! Best prices and fresh meats, wide range of Snowbird necessities. Earn points for discount gas. It's great."}
{"text":"Great savings, quality produce & meats. Love the VIP member savings on gas!"}
{"text":"The fruit is horrible there but all the rest isn't the best but it's better. The only thing I like is the squash."}
{"text":"Overcrowded market. Nothing worth a crap. Overpriced with no real selection. 
Dirty as well."}
{"text":"Ghetto?? Pffft....not even close!  Yes, it is a very busy store, and can get a bit frantic. Haven't seen the bathroom yet, but I usually take care of that before I leave the house. Th store layout is goofy, but I can look past that. The service in there as been exemplary. It is an older store, and prolly could use a little fixing up, sure . Now, time to get groceries."}
{"text":"I'm in town on business and wanted to pick up some things for my hotel mini-fridge. Some items were apparently outdated and the express self-checkout was a nightmare. When my self-check locked up the couple behind me advised that i would not be able to get a checker and that their best advise was to simply take my items without paying (apparently what they have done in the past). They were correct. I never could get a teller to address the issue. When I finally re-gathered my items and went to a regular checkout lane, 3 of the self-check lanes were locked up. Prices for at least some items were clearly higher than Safeway. I'm not certain of the overall pricing but I'm pretty sure Safeway (and Trader Joe) is considerably cheaper. The produce is certainly fresher and the service is a great deal better."}
{"text":"This place is old school.  That's good, because it doesn't make me want to spend more money than I have to.  It reminds me of the A&P store I worked at 26 years ago.  

The deli has a good selection of meats and cheeses, sliced to order, and the service in the deli was very friendly (Christine ?maybe??).

The lines are ridiculous.  I only shopped here twice and both times the wait was just stupid.  The second time was particularly annoying because I was buying one item and the self-serve checkout wasn't accepting my card (for $1.50), and so I had to go to the regular cashier.  They had NO express lanes, so I had to get behind people doing their shop for the week.  And the few lanes they had open each had at least 4 people in them.  Very frustrating.  Glad I don't have to shop here again."}
{"text":"This store has great customer service.  Maria in Starbucks was friendly, courteous and more importantly sincere."}
{"text":"This Fry's in the ghetto. It's dirty on the outside as well as the inside. Even though it's the closest grocery store I still drive out of my way to avoid this place. The times I do go are the first thing in the morning between 6-8 after it's been recently cleaned. By far the worst Fry's in the valley."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. They always sigh heavy and act like anything you need is a burden. Great prices but if you have time go to a different location."}
{"text":"I shop here only when absolutely necessary. They never have a fully stocked store. The last time I purchased something (a week ago), I got it home and it tasted rancid. I then noticed the date. \"Expired May 1, 2015\". Just a few months too old. The deli department is always out of whatever is on sale. The store isn't clean, and there is no one in sight to ask where something is if it can't be found. The line at customer service is waaaaaaaaaay too long. No one there except people buying lottery tickets. I must give them credit (the reason for the one star) for giving me an additional $5.00 for my inconvenience when they refunded my stale purchase."}
{"text":"This was my go to store for a long time. Probably been coming to this location on and off for 19yrs. The employees here have always been helpful and ive never not been able to find what it is iam looking for. 

I dont understand all the bad reviws for this Fry's. Yeah its not the cleanest store and yeah they may run out out certain items. But this is not Scotsdale its in a working class part of town. Most people who shop here like myself are hourly wage laborer's and middle to to lower middle class wage earners. Its a comfortable and friendly grocery store. And yes you may see some people struggling with dissabilities or older folks trying to manuver thu the aisles. As well as some. Interesting characters hanging out drinking coffee at the Starbucks. But so what. Nobody is bothering or causing any harm to any body eles. It's a go to store for many that live in the surrounding neighboorhoods. And its a great store. Very welcoming. So if your bothered by every thing not being just perfect every single time you shop here. Just get over it or go to another store."}
{"text":"The only reason I don't like going to this Fry's is because of the people who go to this location. 
Almost every time there is a scammer there asking for money to help him out. Or people in the parking lot asking for cash for food. BS! 
The only good thing about this location is Cosco next to them..."}
{"text":"I only shop here because of their fuel perks with Shell Gas Stations.  This location is okay, by far the best in this neighborhood.  After dusk, there will be a security guard post here, not really sure why.  They have good alcohol beverages selections.  Food was okay, fruits and veggies are fresh.  Lots of dairy selections too."}
{"text":"Grosser than a gas station bathroom. I went here today for the first and last time. I still get skeeved out thinking about it now. 

I just needed to get tissues and dental floss, and I thought it would be quicker to run in here instead of the Target in the same shopping center. Wrong choice.The floors looked like they hadn't been cleaned in a week. I am not sure why people buy their food here.

When I went to check out with my two items it was like I was at a Wal Mart, long lines and not enough checkers. There were 9 people in line just for the self-checkout. I decided to try and check out at the Customer Service counter I stood there while the employee talked on a personal call. I decided to wait since it was worse at the regular check-out. After a few minutes she told the person on the line she would call them back. Thank God. 

I paid here and got the heck out of there. They actually have a police officer standing outside this place full time. Makes me wonder why???"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this store! It's always clean, I'm always greeted when I go in. The carts are good, they are not bouncy or loud. Everything is easy to find. They are always stocked with things I need. They have very fast checkout lanes even when they are busy."}
{"text":"This place is the worse.  I will make it short & simple:

The staff are rude and careless, and this place is very chaotic.  Purchased expired foul organic chicken in the past; bad fetta cheese; bad meat; and other bad produce that \"looked\" good from the outside only.

There's plenty to be said about this place; but it's frustrating!!!!  Just know that it's a sh*tty supermarket.  Just happens to be close to home :("}
{"text":"Don't leave any personal items behind here (purses IDs, maybe even your kids!) they are the most disorganized organization. I called this morning and was told My ID was here and that I could pick it up in the morning... Now I'm here at 5pm and they can't find it! Nor can they even tell me who was working!!! 

Not only are they disorganized but they are ALWAYS out of strawberries, and don't you dare ask anyone to go back and grab produce for you because they tagged it incorrectly because they'll put their nasty disgusting a hands all over it!"}
{"text":"I have lived hereall my life and in the same area i have seen this new fry's built 
I shop here all the time but i am really getting tired of one specific bager a girl with short redish hair 
She is horrible i will make sure from now on that if she comes to my check out i let the cashier know i want another bagger or i will do it myself 
As a fact bagging was my first Job at a store called Smitty's frys bought them out 
But this girl bags all the items in bags way to full when then the bags will rip when i put them in my car 
And way to heavy and she talks to the cashier extremely rude it is just unbelievable that i seem to always get her and that she still has a job there"}
{"text":"This place is the dive bar of grocery stores. Congrats Fry's! You popped my 1-star cherry.

It is only due to my current boycott of Target that I brought my business to the Fry's next door. This decision was based on principal, but I have to say I have missed Target.  

When I walk through the front doors I just feel miserable. The 'energy-saving' automatic lights make me seize. The narrow aisles make me claustrophobic. The overall dinginess consumes me. I'm suddenly overwhelmed with an anxious feeling similar to when I brought a bad report card back to my parents. Or when I had to confront an ex-gf's parents about why the Pennsylvania State Troopers were calling them at 4am. 

My pace quickens. My pupils dilate. The lump in my throat expands. I try to gasp for air, but the weight on my chest suffocates me. I feel lethal; on the verge of frenzy. My mask of sanity is about to slip. Sweat beads down my back. My aggressiveness becomes visible. The curmudgeon at the self-checkout grunts at me. Darkness comes over me...

I reemerge 36 hours later with no semblance of reality. Fry's is a catalyst of my psychosis."}
{"text":"I Love this Fry's Food and Drug Store. I've been shopping here for the last 5 years and the reason it's Always so crowed is because it's a GREAT STORE!!!!
I know most of the cashiers. Kimberely and Concha I've known the longest... They ALWAYS GO ABOVE AND BEYOND to ensure that you're a satisfied customer and ALWAYS PLEASENT... 
The Pharmacy is Also Fantastic!!! There are two Pharmacists who have been working there for at least 5 years, they are Ray and Andy. They ALWAYS double check to make sure you can take any medication that won't conflict with present medications you're taking. They certainly take their job seriously and genuinely care about your safety and the way you should be taking your medication!!! They Definitely get 5 Stars actually they deserve 10 Stars. I've Grown to Love them...You guys ROCK!!! :) The Pharmacy Technicians are awesome too, Olivia, Cierra and the others are ALWAYS PLEASANT TOO. I've witnessed on a couple occasions where a customer had been rude and talked down to them and each time they remained Pleasant and Professional. You All Rock Too!!!
I wouldn't want to shop anywhere else. Great Store, Great Employees and Fantastic Service and Pricing...
Go and check it out for yourself and tell them Vickey sent you!!!! HAPPY SHOPPING! :)"}
{"text":"WOW. Recently moved to the area and I'm baffled this is the nearest grocery store. Literally so crowded with ghetto tweakers, and super ghetto families with 10 unattended, screaming kids whom the parents don't care to watch. Not only this, the staff looked at me like I was a weirdo or doing something wrong because I am a normal Caucasian female. They had a great selection of items I will say, but due to the crowd and staff I will not be returning. Just not a safe, nor healthy environment I would like to purchase my meals."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this is my regular grocery store. It's kinda dirty. It's kinda ghetto. But it makes up for this in two ways:

1.) There are always parking spots close to the entrance, even when it's super busy. It's like magic.

2.) BUFFEST GROCERY STORE SECURITY GUARD -EVER-. I have to check myself and make sure I'm not entranced by the muscles before walking into oncoming traffic. Kudos, man. It's like you've got a pair of toddlers clinging to your upper arms."}
{"text":"well, I am done with this store, this weekend I went there and there were almost no eggs on the shelf, and my favorite brand of ice cream was nowhere to be seen. I am tired of the poorly stocked shelves and the lack of items I can get elsewhere.

{"text":"I went to this Fry's on Friday the 1/24/14 and I was there to pick up 2 veggie trays for a party at work. I picked up 2 veggie trays and fruit juice poured out all over my slacks and I was upset. I asked to speak to a manager. Now remember I said veggie tray not fruit tray, so when I explained this to a manager who finally arrived he said he was not sure why that happened and was going to find out what and how it happened. So in the mean time Jerry Cruz the manager wanted to know what he could do for me, and I suggested he pay my cleaning bill but instead he offered to purchase the different trays I decided to buy. Thank you Jerry for making it right for me."}

I don't even mind driving a little further for this location.
Thumbs up"}
{"text":"There's always parents @ this Frys, who make  their kids scream &cry. I shop here, ONLY cuz it's close & cheap.    Within the past 2weeks, I got hired @ this Kroger Store (didn't even work--& got fired! cuz I have Epilepsy)  ...A few Thursdays ago, I got told by hiring manager, Holly,  \"we have ur new-hire-paperwork, u start training Sun&Monday!\".     Monday, I got a call from some1 in a Colorado area code, who claimed to be a \"doctor-in-association-w/Frys\". He said I was positive for marijuana--I told him, yeah, I'm disabled & have a (legal) medical marijuana prescription for my Epilepsy in AZ. The Colorado-\"doctor\" told me, I might not get hired by Frys, cuz they don't hire people w/this medical prescription!!  On Tuesday I still had No call back from Frys (eventho I was supposed to have worked Sun & Mon). I went to Frys & asked Holly, \"Oh, I don't have a job? Why didn't u call me?\".  Holly, kept saying that I didn't pass some form of screening test.  How come this hiring manager said I WAS HIRED?!"}
{"text":"Yelp keeps bugging me to write this review, so here goes....

This Fry's has recently undergone an extensive and well needed remodel. It looks much cleaner than it used to, but it's still a rather shady place to shop. The bathroom was absolutely disgusting! I told customer service and they said they would send someone. I have no clue whether or not they ever sent anyone to clean the bathroom, but I sure hope so!

On my last trip there, some guy was walking around the parking lot begging for spare change so he could eat. I gave him the three quarters I had in my middle console. He thanked me, walked away and returned to my car window a few seconds later. Just as I was thinking he was greedy and back for more change, he knocked on my window with a bluetooth in his hand. It was mine! I had dropped it out of my purse when I was putting groceries away. I thanked him and immediately thought about my guardian angel. There was a reason that guy was in the parking lot.

I had a difficult time finding things because they have moved products around in the remodel. I walked up and down the aisles twice looking for popcorn and finally found it. The checkout lines were long, but the store was packed so that was to be expected.  Luckily there were many cashiers available and several self-check out registers."}
{"text":"I feel like I gotta make this a 4 star review to offset all the others.  It seems as if this Frys has fallen victim to the 'Yelp Snobs'.  I go here at least once a week.  I've never thought 'this place is dirty'.  It's not.  At all.  It was recently remodeled and the floors, shelves and produce are all clean and in working order.  Ive never been in the bathroom tho, so I cant speak for that.  It seems as if people like David W. haven't even been here.  Yes, there is a Starbucks inside this location.  There is actually a fairly nice lounge area by it too.  Free Wifi too.  Wells Fargo has a full branch at this location as well.  

I would describe the clientele as 'gritty'.  Yes, every once in a while you will be asked for change in the parking lot.  I've been asked for change in many cities and many stores.  Some have been in extremely nice areas.   Never once have I held it against the business or city I am in.  What a weird reason to give less stars.  I would rather hear your experience about the goods you purchased, not a tirade about drifters in the parking lot.  Nobody cares about your minor inconvenience of saying 'no' to another human being. 

I have for the most part had great service here.  I get in and out very quickly.  There are usually a lot of lines open and there are 6 self checkout stations.  

Ok, now for the negatives.  We have had a few issues with some produce we purchased here.  We have purchased a couple bad onions.  I hope Frys reads this and gets a new onion supplier.  Sometimes produce items are out of stock.  This is a very busy Frys and seems to churn thru their product fairly quickly. There is a good amount of produce they do not stock.  Maui onions and crimini mushrooms come to mind.  No real seafood selection.  I go to AJs on camelback and 44th for that."}
{"text":"Of the eleventy billion groceries in the immediate area, this Fry's is by no means the best of the best. There's some confusion as to who the primary target market is, so it tries to be everything to everyone. If you're particular about brands, you'll end up making more than one stop on your grocery expedition. 

I gave four stars because it's a great place to see the unexpected. You might see a tiny dog launch itself like a rocket from a car in the parking lot to be chased all over and finally wrangled inside the store by a random guy (who jumped out of his truck, leaving it running, to do so) while its owners stand there wondering what to do. If it's a really good day, you'll see a small herd of very young women (and several male handlers) in from Arizona City, avoiding all eye contact while doing their shopping (not gonna lie, it was a sight that caused a lot double-takes and some not so discrete staring in every aisle and at checkout). 

The staff is relatively awesome, too, with many having been there for double-digit years. They're knowledgable about what's going on in the store as well as the items on the shelves. 

It's perfect for general item shopping or picking up a few items on the fly. Random sale items are often ridiculously discounted, so don't be too attached to sticking to your grocery list. You can never have too many paper towels or too much TP."}
{"text":"I'll be taking my business to Safeway. Extremely rude managerial staff."}
{"text":"I really enjoy birthday cakes and I have to say that Fry's can make a good cake. In fact, when put in front of me next to a similar cake from AJ's, I cannot tell a difference (since I am not a spring chicken anymore, I have had many cakes from both places, although I do love AJ's).  

My mother recently purchased two cakes from Fry's: a black forest cake and a Napoleon cake in honor of my birthday.  During the birthday song, I plucked off some blackberries from one of the cakes (hush, it was my birthday!). When the lights came on, I was a bit horrified to see that the remaining berries were covered in white fuzz.  I am very very certain that this fuzz was not sugar, but MOLD.

If you are going to sell a cake topped with fruit, it is very important to use FRESH fruit, or just abandon the concept and put chocolate on the cake instead. I mean, it is a cake, not a tart, and everyone likes chocolate. Or, how about a fruit-shaped cookie or fondant molded into the shape of a strawberry?   

Needless to say, I survived eating the moldy berries, and apparently the taste was well-masked by super sweet frosting. But Fry's Bakery, please take note of this because putting moldy fruit on your otherwise pretty cake is sinful, disgusting, sad and offensive."}
{"text":"Okay, I've been back more than once and while I can't say I've fallen in love, I've certainly developed a little crush on the Fry's Food Store.  I visit Phoenix once every year and stay at a local hotel that has a microwave and refrigerator in every room.  I choose this Fry's to stock up on healthy food, both meals and snacks, while I'm here.  

The produce is fresh and colorful, there is a wide variety of it available and it is attractively displayed.

I stocked up on meat, cheese, soup, microwave meals, I was all over the store and every aisle was clean and well stocked with everything I needed to sooth all my hunger cravings.

I'm upgrading this store's rating to four stars and I believe they have earned it."}
{"text":"Hey I'm a frequent shopper at this Frys-  it's my neighborhood store. However I had an experience today that makes this my forever store. Had a long day had to get some groceries, it's always a tedious chore. My checkout clerk    Whose name was Nanette really looked at me really asked me how I was doing and listened to my answer.  To top it off I got a $29 roast for nine dollars woo hoo woo hoo.!! Finally, I forgot my plant that I had picked out and went out to my car had finished loading all of my groceries and was about to drive away when nanette rushed out yelling at me to stop.   With my plant.    Go Frys!!!!!! Customer for life!!!!"}
{"text":"Kroger: ruining Frys one transaction at a time. 

Today's visit started with a coffee from the deli.  After Jeffrey took my money, I discovered there was only powdered whitener. \"No problem,\" I say, \"it's a supermarket, there's cream in the store.\"  \"No, I can't go and get cream from the dairy department,\" says he, \"it has to come from the warehouse.\" \"May I have my money back?\" I ask.  \"No, I'm not authorized to give your money back,\" says he.  \"Here's your receipt.  You'll have to go to Customer Service.\"

On my way to customer service, I stop at the dairy case for an 88¢ carton of milk, believing that Customer Service will see the logic of placing said carton at the Deli counter.  Along the way I am \"greeted\" by Kelly, the Store manager.  I explain my strategy for customer service.  \"We can't do that,\" he says of the milk, \"it ends up going bad.\"  Why is there no cream; why can't the clerk make refunds? I wonder aloud.  \"There's a problem with the warehouse; ever since Kroeger took charge,\" seemed to be the mumbled response. 

Moral: fry's shoppers be wary--make sure your order is correct before giving over your money.  Or consider Basha's."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst frys I have ever been in. I am a pretty dedicated frys shopper, however, this frys is gross and dirty. The checkout lines are always out of control long and getting through the parking lot without getting hit by a car or cart rolling by, is a miracle. Though it is my \"home\" frys I will drive 4 miles out of my way to go to a different one."}
{"text":"I have to agree with Sally H. below.  I have tried this store a few times and each time I have been here I am begged in the parking lots for money or food, low income families and kids running around not watched and screaming through the parking lots and stores, dirty, and customers in here are just rude individuals.  I think the store tries to accommodate but it's the area.  Need I mention it is the only grocery store I have been to where they feel it is necessary to have a full time security watch person at their front door at all times...  says something...  don't you think?  I live in the Biltmore/Arcadia area and the Safeway on 32nd and Camelback is a really nice store and also on 47th and Indian School without those issues."}
{"text":"I'm conflicted on this location. On one hand, they are very close to home for me. The store is relatively clean. The service is ok. My main concern is the very limited selection of organic food. I would rather buy my organic food here, but often have to get it at the much more expensive Whole Foods. Pity"}
{"text":"This is a nice Fry's location with a big deli, bakery, and cheese section. It has more options than the other Fry's on Thomas that I frequently visit. An example of this would be that they carry Yogi Kava Stress Tea, which I love, the other Fry's does not. This is just one example though I'm sure there are many because the location is larger.

 I still prefer the other Fry's in my neighborhood though because this location is always busy and I don't enjoy navigating through the parking lot. However, this Fry's  location is also closer to other businesses (Costco Target, etc) while the other is off on it's own near houses and apartments."}
{"text":"I live near this Fry's.. The employees are rude...  think they are doing you a favor by you shopping there. Parking is awful, congested drive around many times to find a spot. I will go further to the other Fry's at 30th St. and E. Thomas.. A lot friendlier with employees that show great customer service. Especially Ramon and Tremaine."}
{"text":"What can I say other than it's close to my house and they have some essentials I need.  

The store is ghetto and the meat/seafood counter selection is just as bad.  

The deli is the saving grace here as they have a huge boars head selection sliced to order and great cheese.

The checkout lines are always a wait."}
{"text":"First off FRYS you need to treat your employees much better especially the employee I seen that was being talk down to because of his age. Let me paint you a picture of what I seen and heard. I went there and was behind an elderly gentleman carrying his little bag with his lunch he was limping and had on a Frys apron. He went to the front manager and asked him if there was a department he could work that day because he was just not feeling to good. It appeared he was just asking for that day. The front end manger replied, \"I am not sure I don't know if you know how to do anything else. I just need you to pick up the speed where you are know before I consider anything else. I know I was nosing in his business but it was very heart breaking and degrading at the same time. Let me tell you something Mr, Front end Manager this elderly man is probably the last few of his kind that knows how to work and I am sure worked his tail off. Do NOT ever talk to that generation with anything but respect and kind  assistance where you can offer it. That is if he even allows you because that generation never looked for handout and that is why this gentleman is still working and packing his little lunch to show up for work and not call in like many would or I am just assuming with your company maybe that will be your excuse to let him go. So after listening to this and no it was not my business but I am sure half the things anyone witness in public is not anyone's business but we still slow down to see the wreck. So I proceeded to get my $325.00 of groceries at your place when I should have walked right out and drove down the road. I went isle to isle and as I neared the front another female front end was barking out orders to the checkers yelling right in my ear. Yes, I looked at her and gave her one of my signature looks (Are you serious what is wrong with you) type of look and she continued to degrade the front end employees. However it must not have had an effect on these two clowns that checked me out. Because they were laughing at other people with disabilities and bagging my groceries like they were tossing rocks in a pile. Now let me gentle remind you FRYS without your customers you are nobody and word of mouth travels so fast and as you know all the advertising on billboards cannot compare for a bad experience and a woman that will make it her job to inform the abuse this elderly man took on this day. I was never going to step foot in this store but that is wrong to complain -and not do something. So every week about 2 times I make it a point to check to see if this gentleman still works there and that he may be treated a little more kinder. SHAME ON YOU! for allowing these putz kids to act like idiots and the little feeble elderly man that apparently needs the job and comes to work to make the best out of it is treated with such degrading words and gestures. I wanted to reach in my purse and give him his wage for the day and whip on his apron and show your little store what compassion really means. But I figure this is a generation with great pride and it would do nothing more than make him feel worse. Mark my words! If I ever have your front end manager yell in my ear as I pass by or witness your employees show this man any disrespect you will hear my opinion yell right back and you know those people who holds signs and marches in front of your store well there is a truck full of worker down by Home depot that I can get together that you will see my opinion loud and clear."}
{"text":"People always judge me because I go to the \"ghetto\" Fry's but seriously they do a great job.  Everyone is always so helpful and courteous to me and since the remodel the store has done a 180.  They have also increased their food selection since the remodel which is great.

The part I love best about this store are the cashiers!  Always friendly and talkative and they are definitely characters!  It is refreshing to have someone talk to you as a person instead of just reading your name off VIP card receipt."}
{"text":"Over the past couple of years, I've become very passionate for cooking at home. When I'm not eating out, I'm looking up a recipe on Epicurious, Chow or Food.com for a recipe that pushes my boundaries as cook. Lately, I've been working to perfect my ability to braise pork and beef. It is therefore very important to me to find the ingredients I want, since I'm working to pin down my techniques before I feel more comfortable experimenting with ingredients and flavors.

This particular Fry's is my go-to grocery store.  I shop here for my daily necessities and usually start here when I'm looking to cook something up from a recipe. Unfortunately, as I start to diversify my cooking ability, it has become more and more difficult to find what I need. I understand that Fry's isn't really the spot for finding unique grocery items like baby artichokes, but it definitely has become frustrating that I end up spending 30 minutes looking around for what I need without someone in sight to assist, only to give up or find out that it is not stocked. It's a bit too after-the-fact for them to ask upon checkout, \"Did you find everything alright?\"

In the recent past, I've started my shopping at Fry's and then worked my way over to other grocery stores for the other items. I've shopped for my other items at Sprouts, Whole Foods and AJ's. If cooking something extravagant, I may need to shop exclusively at one of those instead of splitting my time between Fry's and one of the others. 

Selection aside, you really cannot beat Fry's on price for a lot of their standard grocery items, especially meat and produce. Walmart and Target sometimes offers cheaper prices for canned, bottled and boxed products. I'm not a huge consumer of those, so I'll continue shopping at Fry's for my day-to-day items."}
