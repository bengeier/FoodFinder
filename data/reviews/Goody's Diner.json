{"text":"This place is amazing! I went here for the first time because I read great reviews and it was fairly close to my house. There are so many different types of burgers that you won't be able to find anywhere else because of their unique combinations. I had the Highway Man and it was stacked so high I could barely finish it. I also had their root beer float because I was craving it :)  Service was also very helpful. I didin't see the special burgers on the menu or what each one had, and the server took the time to explain each one to me. Very friendly.  Overall, it was an amazing experience and I'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"What's a sultan burger ? I quote \" The Sultan burger consists of the 8oz burger, plus tandoori chicken samosas, butter chicken vegetables, provolone cheese and a lime pickle and jalapeno relish.\" Now I know what you're thinking, way too much going on there. Not so. The patty is perfectly cooked, juicy, full of flavour. The samosa has great crunch and there is just the right amount of spice. On paper it doesn't work, in your mouth it works wonderfully. The catch; these specialty burgers change on a weekly basis. The quantity of the food is substantial. Go here hungry, but go here. I will be a return customer with my eye on the Mac and Cheese and Veal meatloaf."}
{"text":"OMG Well, I went for my 4th visit to Goody's Diner.  I get notifications from them on Facebook about their weekly specials.  This week's burger special was a beef burger wrapped in bacon (not just any bacon though - it was Prosciutto).  Now that was tasty. Except it gets even better.  On the bottom of the delicious bun was 3 perfectly cooked scallops.  Of course this then has melted, creamy cheese on top.  The burger comes with sweet potato fries or Caesar salad.  As I have to watch the carbs I eat and you cannot have a real burger without the bun, I opted for the Caesar.  It too was perfect.  Crispy romaine, lots of bacon and homemade croutons and just enough dressing to hold it all together.  The burger with scallops was at least 6\" thick and worth every messy morsel."}
{"text":"Large variety of burgers. Have eaten there multiple times. Takes roughly half an hour to get your food but is well worth it."}
{"text":"This place is quite a challenge to find unless you have GPS (Good Por Something) j/k... We came in and had a great experience. The Server was very helpful and friendly... We tried a bit of everything on the special burgers.  The Mamma Mia: This one was my least favourite, because of the hot pepper taste, but everything else tasted like eating meatball marinara.  The Farmer John: This one was very good... Fried onion rings, egg, and other goodies I don't recall...Except it was 'GOODY'...  The Highway Man: This one had just as much toppings as the farmer john and tasted great as well.  The Crabby Louie: In our opinion was the best tasting one with real blue fin crab meat that made the burger more tasty...  All in all the burgers all were moist, tender and tasty. A definite re-visit time and time again...  4 out of 5, because in T.O. still haven't found 'The ONE' best burger joint in our taste buds yet, but this one is on our radar every time we're around the area..."}
{"text":"i get mad cravings for Goody's burgers. i've found excuses to go to warden and eglinton just to have one. straight up murders Five Guys which is about 300 meters away. does Five Guys offer lobster bisque as a sub to your sweet potato fries?? helll no. if they were open later or more days on the weekend, my prayers would be answered."}
{"text":"My friends and I recently came here for brunch and I have to say, what a great idea!   First off, the service at Goody's DIner is exceptional! Our waitress was more then willing to answer any questions we had about different menu options and provided us with everything we needed.   I had the steak with three eggs which to me isn't anything special since it reminded me of all the other similar options out there. I do have to say that the steak was huge! And i was extremely happy that they provided the coffee free of charge!  I also had their soup special which was the lobster bisque. It was very creamy and thick and went well with the cold that I was coming down with. Definitely try it out if they have it!  Overall, I would highly recommend this place simply because the food was quite good and the service was awesome."}
{"text":"Tried this place out on the recommendation of a friend. We went for a late lunch, we arrived around 1pm and the small diner (space for a little over two dozen people to sit comfortably) was mostly empty. (Although several people came in as we were finishing our meals.) Parking was inconvenient, but since it's in a business-industrial type area we just parked at on of the nearby businesses. The dining area itself seems clean. Washroom was tiny and smelled bad, but it's a diner after all.  I got the Goody's Burger, my friend got one of the special burgers (not on the menu, but pictures hang above the counter on the side). My burger was quite good! We tried Five Guys Burger when it opened just down the street from Goody's but I like the Goody's burger much better. My friend really enjoyed his burger as well, although it was so packed with toppings it was quite difficult to eat. Got the sweet potato fries with it, they were decent, same as you'd get at most other restaurants. (Actually I don't think I've ever had \"amazing\" sweet potato fries anywhere that I can recall.) My Coke came in a glass bottle which is a nice touch. Total came to about $26+tip for the two burgers (with fries) and two soft drinks.  In terms of service, the servers & cooks were all very friendly! They must get a lot of regulars coming back because several times they greeted people who came in by name. When the server heard it was our first time he took extra time to explain the menu, specials, and their non-menu burgers.   Overall a pleasant experience. I will be back ... not often though. Not because it's not good, but because it's not necessarily good for my health ... I'm sort of glad I don't live nearby, otherwise I might visit far too frequently."}
{"text":"This place was great! It's a little hard to fine, since it is off the beaten path of Warden and Eglinton. The food is excellent. I had the Reuben sandwich, which was excellent. It was huge and I could not finish it all. My boyfriend had the Macho nacho burger which was also good. We felt like food won because we had no room for dessert, but the tables around us managed to eat a gourmet burger plus dessert! This is definitely a spot where the locals go."}
{"text":"Restaurant: Goody's Diner Cuisine: Diner Location: Scarborough Address: 133 Manville Rd Price Range: $10~15  1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 4 Service: 3  Ambiance: 3 Overall: 3.5  Extra information:  * Closed on Monday * Open for breakfast to early dinner * Closes at 7pm  I drove to Scarborough for the first time ever last month for work, and everytime I went, my friend insisted I visit Goody's Diner. I wasn't going to dine at a restaurant by myself....yes, I know I am still a kid. So one day I dragged my friend a long so I can try this amazing burger they have!  We arrived around 12:30 and the restaurant was already filled with people! It seemed like they all just arrived for lunch so we were expecting to wait at least 30 minute. Thankfully, one table left a little early and we only waited for 15 minutes. I already knew what I wanted, one of their special burgers!! It was just the matter of which one because they all looked great.  After some anticipation, I finally made my decision  Ordered: Highway Man 4/5  * Cheddar, Swiss, sunny side up egg, Jack Daniel BBQ sauce, triple stacked onion rings stuffed with pastrami for $14 * All their burgers are topped with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, garlic mayo and zucchini corn relish * I knew the burger was big....but didn't expect to see this!! * There was no way I could hold the entire burger and eat it * I didn't even want to give it a try, I just went ahead and used my fork and knife * Burger was stuffed with so much stuff it was hard to grab a bite of everything altogether * Beef patty was cooked welldone and there was so much pastrami * Sunny side up egg with the runny yolk and the bbq sauce added a nice touch * Fries reminded me of Costco fries, rough in batter and very crispy * Burger was awesome and fries were great * It did feel like the burger was tiny bit too much but it was delicious * I just don't think I can have it more than once a month * Can you believe I actually finished the burger? I was so full after!  Ordered: Bacon Explosion  * My friend ordered the special * I didn't get to try this but he said it was filled with so much bacon  Summary: It gets very busy right when lunch time starts so make sure to go a little early to beat the first crowd. If you don't eat much, this is probably not the place for you...but if you insist on trying it, you can probably order 1 and share between 2 people. I heard their regular menus are great as well so I will def be back to try other items! Food coma anyone?"}
{"text":"Best burgers in town!  Great selection, HUGE portions yet extremely tasty.  I've paid quadruple the amount for burgers at much 'nicer' places and they still can't hold a candle to this place.  Service is very friendly, although very slow whenever I go.  I can easily overlook this since it's well worth the wait...and they're trying their best with the crowds they seem to always have.    HIGHLY recommend!"}
{"text":"My sister and I went here for a late lunch and I had the Goody's Burger , a salad as a side with their house dressing (should've ordered it on the side next time); and my sister had their pulled pork burrito with sweet potato fries. YUMMMMM. Delicious. It was just that good. And price? very affordable. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I'm only giving this update  a one star because it's closed and I had to make a selection.    I can't believe they closed down!   Nooooooo!!!!  I just read this on their Facebook page, they are closing Goody's to concentrate on Noble Catering.  This was the note:  \"A huge thank you to all our valued customers at Goody's Diner - your patronage was greatly appreciated. It was great getting to know many fabulous people and we're glad you enjoyed Goody's so much!  We certainly appreciate everyone's well wishes and concern. Unfortunately we have had to make a very difficult decision & Goody's Diner is closed due to very high operating and product costs. Many of you know we operate two businesses - Noble Culinary and Goody's. It's become too much to operate both business and we will continue only with Noble Culinary."}
{"text":"I've been all over the U.S., and Toronto area.  And this place has the best burgers by far. It's small and located in an area with a lot of mechanic shops.  But this place is truly awesome!"}
{"text":"Long review ahead... Please take caution. .................................  Goody's Diner is located in an internal auto-mechanic district of scarlem. Why did it take me this long to try it then when it's my kind of 'hood?  1.  Hours(9 am - 7 pm) 2.  Days( Monday - Friday) 3.  Diner scheme(American{1} Foodstuff) 4.  Burgers(is a Burger is a Burger{2}) 5.  It's not on the way to anywhere  Walking up to the building feels like you're going to work(blue collar-style). Memories of my youth in a sweatshop(kidding), more like a jacket factory. Inside is far from Johnny Rocket's glam, more like plain simple \"suitable\". Environment fitting of it's awesome owners, staff, customers and food. Didn't hurt that it had my favourite passtime available, CP24!  The half Fourth star is purely due to amazing family-style hospitality of the staff. From the chef/owner to the line-cook it's all about a great open atmosphere. It's very rare to see the enthusiasm, pride and heart from the owner's actions. This is why if ever Food quality fails, the loyal customers will still come back. But if what I see is true, the food will not be a disappointment, less satisfied at most.  Two of us split the first so-called appetizer, naww we just like Wings!  1LB Wings & Beer($11.95)       ~Not listed but it came with a side too, chose Fries(shoe string) quite crisp.        Wings which I think might be store variety, but taste great and slight grilled yea.        Beer limited, Sam Adams being pretentious of the Coors, Blue, & Canadian.  Aunt Millie($11.95)       ~I had one bite so I can't really distinguish this as a yay or nay.      ~I'm a no to feta kind of person anyways so this Greek-style not my choice.      ~Side(choice):  Sweet Potato Fries quite standard.      ~Height:  75% of the Coca Cola glass next to it.  Highwayman($11.95)       ~Onion, Lettuce, Tomato, Fried Egg, Onion Ring, Smoked Meat, Cheddar      ~Don't forget about the 8oz Sirloin Burger that's chargrilled non-flat top.      ~Mine was overcharred outside but perfect cooked juiciness inside cancels out.      ~Takes time to cook(forewarned) and assembly required(by cook).      ~Side(choice):  Onion Rings quite standard.      ~Height:  95% of the Coca Cola glass next to it.  I overheard that they take customer's suggestions for future Burger creations. A random pick-out-of-a-hat and see if they can get inspiration from it. From what I see, their Burger Wall is all made from available inhouse ingredients. Macho Nacho(Nachos), Highwayman(Sandwich), etc... I could have probably got a personalized Wings/Fries/Beer Burger if I asked.  Wingfriesbeerger($???)       ~Celery/Carrot Mayo Slaw      ~Spicy! Chicken Wings(boneless pls)      ~Shoe String Fries      ~Guinness Cheddar Cheese(melted)      ~8oz Sirloin Burger  .................................  {1}  Nothing against Americans, just that Diners isn't my comfort food of choice. {2}  Nothing against Burgers, just that Burgers isn't my comfort food of choice.  Sidenote:     \"Who would actually order the Macho Nacho Burger?\"  That was the topic between me and my friend during Burger selection. We continued on the discussion after we left Goody's as well. It looks like someone on Yelp turned herself in to the authorities. I agree with you too, that's some weird Elite Yelper."}
{"text":"GOOD RIDDANCE!     After reading Googs and other chain-haters on Chowhound shill for this place since the day it opened, some even suggesting that it would put Five Guys out of business, this is POETIC JUSTICE!   I don't buy their excuses of high costs and that they're too busy with their catering business.    If they were doing as well as Googs and \"You Gotta Eat Here\" made them out to be, they'd still be open, or moved to a new location.  The catering business was profitable, obviously the restaurant was not.  They couldn't compete against Five Guys.  If you want to compete in the big leagues you have to at least SHOW UP, and these guys rarely did -- short hours, unannounced closings, etc.  Five Guys is open and ready to serve their customers 11am to 10pm every day without question.    Googs, come out and say it:  Five Guys whupped their ass and ran them out of town.  Admit it, I WAS RIGHT AND YOU WERE WRONG.   Burger Night in Scarborough final score:  American chain 1, Canadian local poseur 0.  AS IT ALWAYS WILL BE.  Let's face it, Goody's Diner served MEATLOAF BURGERS (yuck), copied recipes and photographs straight out of an American website (Wisconsin Dairy Board), and acted like they created it all.  Googs, can you say PLAGIARISM?   Take a look and see for yourself:  http://www.cheeseandburger.com/  It feels great to be able to post this publically here and tell it like it is, since if this were posted on Chowhound their unfair moderators would have deleted it in short order.   Damn this felt great to write!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem! Seriously, the best burgers in town. All the staff are so friendly and I actually want to try everything on the menu. On my first visit I tried one of their specialty burgers, the Bacon Explosion and I will go so far as to say it was the best burger I ever had. Their fries were on point as well, perfect amont of crisp. I also really like how you can see into the kitchen from the dining area. Highly recommend this place! I'm pretty tiny and barely finish a plate sometimes but everything was SO GOOD not a crumb was wasted."}
{"text":"Inexpensive, delicious burgers with just enough class to be charming while still remembering that it sits within a mostly industrial development.  The old-school glass Coke bottles were a killer touch!"}
{"text":"Elbows up and assume the position, this is some excellent eats, just like you would find on Diners Drive-ins and Dives. I was hungry when I walked into Goody's, and began to salivate once I read the menu. I selected a once classic burger that was being sent to its retirement, called the Bacon Mac and cheeseburger, this was going to be her last supper, she was big in the beginning but after a few huge bites I was able and willing to conquer this tasty beast in around 3 minutes.  Can't wait to get back here, I'm sure the calories are crazy nuts, but if i cared at all I'd be in the gym.  Enjoy Goody's."}
{"text":"Just had my first Experience today with my GF was her 2nd Experience... Very happy we decided to come for lunch :) very clean and friendly enviroment.. Have some of the craziest Burger combinations you can think of :P I had the Macho Nacho and a poutine, gravy reminded me of A&W'S very tasty, GF had farmer Johns and fries and gravy and we both had 2 bottles of coke each ( served in real glass bottles not plastic) Only thing me and my GF agreed on is they should put all there crazy burger combinations on the menu itself instead of on the wall.. I would rate it a 4.5/5 Stars will defintely be returning again.. KEEP UP THE GOOD JOBS GUYS"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!! Went here after seeing all of the great reviews for it, and wow, did it ever live up to them. Let's break it down, shall we? The fries: thin and crispy, but not too thin. The Poutine? Amazing. I actually really enjoyed it, the gravy was full of flavour, and they used cheese curds. The sweet potato fries? Absolutely amazing, and the chipotle mayo  they were served with is definitely one of my favourites. The best part though? The burger. I had the Farmer John's burger, which had potato cakes, onion rings, a sunny side up egg, bacon, tomato, red onion, and to top it all off, the bun had been french toasted! I had no idea how I was going to eat it (the burgers are very \"tall\") but trust me, I made it work, and once I got started I couldn't put it down. You can't find the specialty burgers list on their website, but trust me, it's worth it to just go and see for yourself. I'm already dying to go back and try another!"}
{"text":"I think they have stopped altogether. No sign of life anymore.it was a nice place for linch"}
{"text":"driving here for the first time you may find yourself confused because its hidden in the middle of an industrial park full of auto repair shops. apparently this place has been open for nearly two years but its been under the radar for me. i had the bacon wrapped beef & scallop burger with a side of caesar. the beef, according to me, is critically acclaimed!!! usually burgers are dried out or have an overload of toppings that you never really taste the beef!!!but not this one. the bacon wrapped around it with scallops was amazing touch to give it that extra flav. my friend's mama mia burger was really good as well but seemed to be less juicy then mine. the spicy touch made up for the somewhat dried out patty....one thing i think they could improve on is the bun...i do admire all the artisan cheeses they use on the different burgers. overall a great first experience with the food and service which calls for a second return."}
{"text":"When my GPS asked me to turned into an industrial area on the way to Goody's Diner, I was wondering if I am going to another those old, dirty diner/burger places I been to.... but I am pleasantly surprised when I stepped inside Goody's.  As usual, I got this look from all the staffs when I walked in.... 3 pm.... an empty restaurant... and what is she doing here look.  I was given the regular menu but seriously considering one of the special burgers... they all looked good and deliciously deadly... and most important, great for my photo shots....but little did I know I would be labelled as weird based on what I chose by some other!   The Macho Nacho ($11.99) with sweet potato fries and a drink was beyond satisfying. Everyone started smiling when they realized I am going to eat that burger by myself and all come to my assistance as of how to eat the burger without making a mess?!   Sit on it first so it would be flattened so it will fit into my mouth? one suggested Move the pick to one side so when I bite into it , the toppings won't come bursting out? Use 2 picks and anchor the fillings and then cut that in half? other suggested  The burger was enjoyable... the ground sirloin beef patty was cooked to perfection, though well done was still juicy and well seasoned. The toppings are what one would expect from a nachos.... beans, chips, corn, pepper, sour cream, chilli.......  I finished the whole thing.... yes I really did..... aside from some of the sweet potato fries... The sweet potato wedges were good, crispy outside and still soft and mushy inside.... but I was  just too full!!!!!  All the staffs in the restaurant said I am ready for a nap.... They seems to know me well?! Too well.........  Goody's Diner has such good services and friendly vibe which I really enjoyed. Even my first visit, I felt right at home.......   Until next time.... burp!"}
{"text":"I wanted to try Goody's Diner (Twitter: @GoodysDiner) forever but their hours are just not very convenient being only open on weekdays til 7pm but this year, they extended are open on Saturday as well..... so a few Saturday ago, we finally made our way there since we were craving for some greasy food after a night of drinking (hangover) =P   It's located among warehouses and you can easily miss it if you don't look carefully since it really doesn't look like a restaurant on the outside.   Daily specials available and although on a late Saturday afternoon, the place was mostly pack(can't imagine what it's like on the weekdays)   Farmer John $14.00 w/ Sweet Potato Fries ~ cheddar, havarti, potato cakes, strip bacon, a sunny side up egg, onion rings and French toast the inside of their sesame bun ~This was epic and I resisted the urge to use fork and knife but go all in messy with my hands. ~Many people did ask me how I manage to eat it after tweeting and Instagram-ing it... what I did is hold it firmly and try to squeeze it a bit flatter and took one bit of the top half and another of the bottom half then chew so I get a bit of everything (^_^) ~The patties here are made well done but it wasn't dry at all, definitely a greasy goodness that we were looking for that day and anything just taste better top with an egg but the running yolk did add to the mess (not a pretty sight) =P ~I normally don't eat that much fries and intended to save room for the burger but it was so crispy (some sort of batter) and moist in the inside that we end up eating most of our fries (O_o)\"   Highway Man w/ Fries $14 ~ cheddar, Swiss, a sunny side up egg, jack Daniel's BBQ sauce, triple stacked onion rings stuffed w/ pastrami ~The boyfriend ordered this which look just as epic and after tasting both, I like mine better since there was way too much pastrami here and I felt there's way too much meet.   Verdict : I don't think I can handle this very often or I'll get a heart attack =P We definitely had a food coma after this but we'll be back"}
{"text":"This review documents two meals that I had at Goody's diner in a span of 3 days. Because I loved my first experience at Goody's Diner so much, I dragged a couple of friends back here to enjoy a leisurely brunch. And two days later, I came back with my family for lunch to try more of their fabulous burgers.   Mel had a Monte Cristo sandwich-ham, egg, swiss cheese, mushroom on French toast with spicy potato wedges. She gave a generous portion for me to try, and I loved it! I'm a big fan of the sweet and the savoury combination, and I liked that the French toast wasn't sickeningly sweet. My favourite part, however, was the mushroom, which added a great earthiness to the sandwich. It was the perfect brunch sandwich! I loved it so much that I got it again when I came back two days later. On a side note, those spicy potato wedges were also really tasty as well!  I ordered a Breakfast club with bacon, egg, lettuce, tomato, and cheddar cheese on rosemary focaccia. I substituted the default peameal bacon for the regular kind, as well as swapped my spiced potato wedges for sweet potato fries. The staff graciously accommodated all of my requests. The sandwich was quite delicious and moist, though not as good as the Monte Cristo, in my opinion. I particularly enjoyed the focaccia and the sweet potato fries.  Two days later, I came back with my family to try more burgers! Our first choice is the much lauded Highwayman, featuring zucchini corn relish, 8 ounce burger patty, cheddar cheese, onion rings stuffed with homemade pastrami, Jack Daniels BBQ sauce, a fried egg, Swiss and Havarti cheese, lettuce, tomato and onion, garlic mayo. For me, there was a little too much going on, and everything together was a little too salty, especially the pastrami. I think the burger would've worked better if I was able to eat all the components together, but this was an impossible feat given the size. Nevertheless, everyone was still quite impressed with the burger.   I urged my sister to order the burger special of the week- The Orchard- with grilled apples and pears, bacon, apple butter bbq sauce, provolone cheese, and the usual lettuce, tomato, and onion. This was, to date, my favourite burger from Goody's Diner! The grilled apples and pears, in combination with the bbq sauce, were fabulous because they added that bright and sweet balance to the beef. As I said, I'm a huge fan of the sweet and the savoury, so this burger was the perfect for me. Even though the Orchard had less components than the Highwayman, I think everyone agreed that in terms of flavours, this burger was more sophisticated and interesting than the Highwayman.   All in all, I loved both of my meals at Goody's, and my friends were all very satisfied with the food and service. I'm really hoping that they will extend operating hours!"}
