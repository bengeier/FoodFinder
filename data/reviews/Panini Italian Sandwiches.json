{"text":"Best veal sandwiches in Woodbridge. California sandwiches doesn't hold a candle to this place. Amazing bread, meat cooked to perfection, unlike California where the slimy meat slides out of its bread coating. Perfect place for a quick lunch"}
{"text":"Had veal panini..  Was great one of best.. Cost about 10 with cheese and bottle of water.  Lots of tables to choose from.  TV with news available."}
{"text":"One of the best veal places in town..... Up there with original California...... Good portion sauce is wicked nice bun. Lots have places have good veal sandwich this one is great."}
{"text":"Been a Panini customer for a decade or longer. Amazing sandwiches! A must try if in the area!

The aurora location is amazing as well"}
{"text":"We have a Friday tradition to go out for lunch and last week we went to Panini Restaurant.

I usually have the veal cutlet with grilled eggplant, mushroom, and cheese. It is always yummy and juicy. The sandwich is pretty big so i was able to eat half of mine. 

Best veal sandwich shop in Woodbridge by far!"}
{"text":"Amazing Sandwich place.  It's all you want in a veal sandwich.  Great service and great food.  On a personal note if a sandwich place is being dissed because it doesn't compare to California Sandwiches it's a good thing.  Double down and go.   California sandwiches is like the Chef Boyardee of Pasta."}
{"text":"Excellent veal cutlet sandwich. I had it with the grilled zucchini, eggplant, hot peppers and mushrooms for $11. It was about the size of a large burger with two very thin veal cutlets in it. Delicious! And FAST! Neat little place, and there's an awesome super market next door (with sushi, dim sum, bakery, etc). Convenient, grab lunch at Panini's and dinner for later from the grocer."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with family and as always the veals were amazing but a little disappointed with the meatball sandwich I had which seemed smaller than normal (prior).
Service was quick and friendly as always also."}
{"text":"I honestly feel it's not that yummy. I have no idea why the rating is so high. The beef is too tough to bite it. The chicken is over cooked and tastes really dry. The tomato sauce is really salty. The rapini tastes like they just take it out from the oil and again it's over cooked! The mushroom is nothing special, it seems just directly take out from the can(you can just buy it from any supermarket).

The bread is really dry! 

After I ate it, I have to drink a lot of water.
That's why I only give them one star."}
{"text":"Best veal cutlets in a bun.
Skip California sandwiches and visit Panini Italian sandwiches instead!

Sandwiches are homemade non-greasy and packed with veal."}
{"text":"Let's face it - California Sandwiches and San Francesco's (downtown) are sell out veals. The San Francesco's up in North York at Finch and Alness is amazing....

And then there's Panini. 

This place is LEGIT. Perfect slight crispiness to the veal, perfect amount of sauce, peppers, rapini... It's perfect. It better be, it's prime Woodbridge turf.

I also think it's run by a family which I dig. Seeing a little Italian mother in the back working the sandwiches made me feel at home. Even though I'm not Italian. I'm a Jew. But I look Italian. And I love home cooking. 

Oh - and it was pretty cheap too! Like $10 for a panini with cheese, peppers, rapini and a pop. 

Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Pretty good but my veal panini didn't taste that fresh. Pricey as well. For price and quality in Woodbridge, the veal sandwiches are better at Ricci's."}
{"text":"This is one of the little known secrets in Woodbridge.  It's funny cause one time a friend of mine was telling me about another panini place around the area and never even had heard about Panini Italian Sandwiches.  After bringing him here he was instantly converted.

This place isn't exactly a giant chain, it's pretty much a generic store in a  giant plaza.  you wouldn't know it was there unless you were in the plaza itself.  However, you'll shortly notice that a TON of people seem to come here. 

Panini Italian Sandwiches is exactly that, they make italian sandwiches.  We're talking veal, chicken, steak etc.  Top that with cheese, mushrooms, rapini, peppers and you've got yourself a flavour explosion in your mouth.  They have a pretty small menu (i guess).  Personally I only either order the veal or the chicken.  They're both equally good, but I usually get the chicken cause it breaks apart easier.  I also top it with cheese and mushrooms, but I guess you can put whatever on it you want.

A fair note about the \"hotness\" of their sauce (cause I always like to know how hot is \"hot\") is that it really isn't; I'd say it's about a medium.  Then again, it may be one of those \"the sauce is hot today\" kinda things, so don't kill me if your mouth burns off.

Anywho, if you're in woodbridge and want a good sandwich?  Go here.  End of story (or review)."}
{"text":"We went to this place with high expectations based on the yelp reviews we read..  needless to say, we were greatly disappointed! I have no idea why people are giving it 5 stars.

We ordered a veal cutlet panini with cheese.. to start off, the bun was cold..  the veal was too thin and way too dry that it was really hard to finish the whole thing- even though my hubby and I shared it!! 

Service was ok and quick.

We won't be returning here and we should've stuck to California Sandwiches, which is still our fave cutle)t \"go-to\" place.  Waste of money ($8 and change with tax)."}
{"text":"Veal Sandwiches are amazingg here. Staff is so friendly and helpful. I go here more than once a week :)"}
{"text":"I usually come by when I am in the Woodbridge area for the awesome Italian sandwiches. My favourite is the spicy italian sausage. The size is pretty decent and the sauce is tasty. 
Its a sandwich! What more can I add?"}
