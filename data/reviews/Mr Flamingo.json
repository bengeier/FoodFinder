{"text":"Two of us came here for drinks and apps early (6:30 pm) on a Saturday night. It's a small, casual, and cozy place. 

Cocktails were around $14. All of the ones we tried were tasty - I liked Ms. Sitherwood which was like a bourbon iced tea.

For apps, we had oysters and a smoked trout chowder. The trout was flaky and the chowder had pieces of bacon, was the perfect size and consistency, and was the most comforting dish on a cold evening.

Service was friendly and attentive. I would love to come back for the cocktails and to try more dishes."}
{"text":"I'm not always a fan of a limited menu, I don't want a tonne of options but Mr. Flamingo was a bit reserved. 

Having said that, I shared a couple of yummy dishes with my friend. Star for me was the gnocchi. It was like high end mac and cheese, I was scraping the plate with my fork. We also had a trout dish that was okay but certainly not disappointing. 

Nice wine selection, reasonable prices and a cozy atmosphere. Probably a good date spot!"}
{"text":"I really had no idea what to expect, and when I saw my teacup-sized portion of French onion soup come to the table I almost laughed out loud. As soon as that flavour hit my lips, however, I knew everything I needed to know. It was perfection. The fois gras melted in my mouth and the flavours were on point. I followed it with the scallop tartar, which was delightfully gooey and salty. My dinner mates had the arugula salad and mushroom risotto and the gnocchi. They were also great. I respected the time the server took to explain everything on the bar list or the menu. There were ingredients or combinations we weren't familiar with, and he didn't try to rush us - but rather, make sure we knew what it was completely. I appreciate it when I'm sitting down to an expensive meal. (Worth every penny)"}
{"text":"Was part of a large party tonight. Waitress was nice to me when I arrived, alone, but as soon as the rest of the party arrived she was straight up rude, and condescending. Every time I spoke to the waitress after that she answered like I was incredibly stupid and putting her out. 

Food arrived sporadically, which makes sense as they said food would be served \"as its ready\" but we had multiples of certain items and they arrived at different times. The risotto wasn't served hot, the grey owl cheese on top was a tiny piece. It was alright overall but lacking in flavour. The cavatelli with duck confit was delicious. The hold the mezcal cocktail was good but I wouldn't buy it again for $14. 

The WORST part of this experience - I thought we might have to split our bill so I did the math with a 20% tip (as I noticed the menu said there would be a 20% tip on parties over 6. Waitress did not deserve a 20% tip but I knew it was coming). Found out a few minutes later that we were doing separate bills - no problem then ! They'll do the math for me. My boyfriend went to pay. 

The two (small) entrees, a cocktail and a beer came to $73.75 after tax and tip, by my math. After we left my boyfriend said he paid $86. I asked why? That didn't add up. He said well it was $73 before the tip. I put 15%. I said no, $73 is WITH a 20% tip. He said there was no line to state the gratuity on the bill. So we ended up tipping a terrible waitress 35%. 

Also the website menu was not up to date - had been looking forward to the seared scallops but they weren't on the menu. Yes, it mentions that the menu changed often, but when the menu is so small, it should be up to date on the website"}
{"text":"Would definitely go again!!

It was a birthday dinner for 9 people and they went out of their way to make it special. There was a minor hickup re the reservation and they went out of their way (including balloons) to make it right. 

Agree with other reviewers that you need to reserve if you are a large party.

Was perfect for a bday. Great food, not too pricey. Drinks are reasonable as well. Had a great mushroom risotto. Shared a buratta to start. Bread was great too! Donuts for desert.

Staff were super helpful and took great care of us. Would go again."}
{"text":"The menu size was perfect and the service was great. I had the duck confit pad Thai which was pretty good, my partner had the gnocchi which was excellent. I would definitely return if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and style. The Burrata was amazing, so was the eggplant. Food was oddly paced and thats the only reason why it didn't get five stars. I've already recommended it to some of my friends. Make sure you make a reservation or you might have to wait a while for a table."}
{"text":"We went for an early dinner so the restaurant was very quiet when we arrived but filled up during our meal. 
We enjoyed pretty much everything we ate - which was a lot - and would go there again! Here is the breakdown:

Lobster baked oysters - oddly warm, briny oysters with velvety hollandaise and tart pickled celery. The standout of the evening. 

Burrata with tomatoes - creamy cheese paired with firm tomatoes had just the right amount of bite and seasoning. They paired well together, very fresh tasting. 

Scallops with popcorn puree - I loved this, my husband was not as big a fan as I. The sea asparagus were all dente and briny and meshed well with the firm scallops and crunchy popcorn dust topper. 

Mushroom risotto - fair. The risotto was well-cooked, but not a super exciting dish. 

Duck - The foie gras was creamy and buttery and a great pairing to the smokiness of the duck. The accompanying cherries were a great complement. 

Smoked Trout - you could taste the smoke, but it wasn't overwhelming. I am a trout lover, and this dish was nice but not mind-blowing. 

In lieu of dessert, we had another round of oysters - they were THAT GOOD!! 
I highly recommend this restaurant. From out server who provided expert taste assessments and well-suited cocktail recommendations, to the cool atmosphere, Mr. Flamingo won't disappoint."}
{"text":"The food was great. We had a company event there. Right sized portions. Original. Yummy. A very welcome addition to the neighbourhood and kudos to the chef for adding a Canadian flare. 

The only slag about this place was our server. She was completely and absolutely despondent. No knowledge or interest in discussing the wine, not one smile, we had to fetch her a few times and the brought out a birthday cake when the birthday boy's partner wasn't at the table. Seemed like a hipster that would rather do anything else other than serve people.

If you go - you'll love the food, hopefully you'll have a 20something that has a clue and knows what it's like and what is expected when on works in the service business."}
{"text":"The food here was very mediocre. 

We ordered the French Onion Soup (it was good only because of the foie gras on top), the mushroom risotto (i've made better myself at home), the scallops with butter popcorn sauce (the scallops were cooked well but the sauce did not go well with it) and the pasta dish (tasted like any other alfredo sauce). 

Overall, it wasn't bad but if i'm paying almost $100 for dinner/drinks, I expect it to taste better than things I can make myself at home. 

Go somewhere else instead. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Me and my partner came for oysters on Wednesday. We were really disappointed by the service we received. There was two girls on the floor, we came in and didn't even receive a warm welcome. She shouted towards the bar for us to sit down but we noticed a table was free but had a few dirty plates on it. We asked the rushing waitress with brunette hair if we could sit down. She snapped \"NO NOT YET! YOU HAVE TO WAIT TILL IT'S CLEARED\". 

We waited awkwardly in the middle of the room. When we eventually sat down, she just dumped the menus on the table. Didn't even tell us that there was a deal on the oysters. I never saw her smile. We asked her about the oysters, \"what's on them?\" \"horseradish, lemon\" really short one worded answers. 

I've never ever come across such BAD service. At the end, I didn't want to tip. However, I was FORCED to. 20%! The machine would not let me change the amount. I was absolutely sickened. No one even said goodbye when we left. It was awful. 

Why should I HAVE to tip 20% to someone with the most horrible attitude? Seems to me, she's getting her tips so she can be rude as wants. 

Is that even allowed? Forced to tip?
I even emailed them beforehand and recieved a half-assed sorry and they even admitted they forced customers to tip.

I didn't say anything at the time because I didn't want it to ruin our dinner and night out."}
{"text":"Started with the steak tartare - yummy! and the burrata - underwhelming. Next were the duck confit ragu and mushroom risotto, neither were anything special, but the risotto was the better dish. The main, cod cheeks, were definitely the highlight, flaky and delicious. A fine night out, but I'm not running back any time soon!"}
{"text":"Great first experience, weak second time. Loved most of the cocktails -- Castle Black smelled disgusting but was actually interesting and pretty good. Food had promise but the menu changes a lot, fast, so don't fall in love with any item. Sundays are dead --- 4 people in the whole place for at least 2 hours. Wednesday buck a shuck is a great deal and where I'd steer someone for a visit. Still finding its identity"}
{"text":"Ambiance and service was really good. We had the steak tartar, burrata, and pasta. Was my first time having steak tartar but my friend said it was really good so I'll go with that. I enjoyed the burrata and my old fashioned, but felt the sauce for the pasta was a little bland and didn't love my second drink (ms siltherwood). 

Overall it's nice for a night out, nice location and friendly environment, but the only reason I came here is because it was on a best of 2015 list, and was underwhelmed."}
{"text":"My husband and I came on a Saturday night for dinner at 7:30. The service was excellent. We liked the food, hated the atmosphere. Also, the menu on their website had WAY more dishes than what was featured last night. 

This review is completely subjective. I am not a person who cares for very noisy, small, grungy places so Mr. Flamingo really wasn't for me. However, if you live in the area this is a great option for a quick bite and drink as the food was quite good.

We had:

Spiced olives: 4/5 tasty but not spicy 

Steak tartar: 4/5 a really nice blend of flavours in the tar tar. I didn't love that it came with potato chips.

Mushroom risotto: 5/5 this was delicious. I loved the sun choke chips!

Cod cheeks:  3/5 I was really surprised that these were deep fried. It did not mention this in the menu description. I don't eat fried food but I traded entrees with my husband and he really liked it so I guess it's good. 

I had a bourbon based cocktail called Ms. (Something that starts with an s.) it took a while to come but it was really strong and tasty. 

TIP: I suggest ordering some of the $4 snacks at the top of menu (olives, pickles, garlic bread etc.) they come out fast so you can nibble while you wait for your drink."}
{"text":"This place is excellent! Crack team of wait staff, bartender and chefs made delicious oysters with house sauces, drinks and ceviche. I got the wubalubadubdub cocktail (yes someone was a big fan of Rick &  Morty) and the pisco sour. I preferred the pisco but the wubalub had a nice sour lemon bite to it. Pair it with the ceviche for sure. 

The downside to this nice little haunt is that the bill racks up pretty quickly with drinks as pricey as they are."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of coming here last Saturday for my birthday.

Great extension of Bambi's (the bar below) however different vibe.

Mr Flamingos is an incredibly inviting bar. I was worried it was going to feel too crammed and \"clubish\" Sometimes new bars try so hard to come off as uber cool that they turn me off. But instead I was greeted at the front door with hugs and the service continued to be warm, friendly and inviting.

There was just 3 of us and we managed to score the table at the back by the kitchen. With so many options on the menu it was hard to narrow it down so we ordered almost all of them. The olives were green and looked like gobstoppers so round and bright. We ordered the chips which some of my crew felt were too salty but I liked them. We also ordered the steak tartare and the scallop ceviche. Whenever I see either on the menu I always order them. But I would put their tartare among my favourites in the city and the ceviche equally didn't disappoint.

The only item that did disappoint were the lobster baked oysters that tasted a bit too fishy. I  was almost worried I would regret eating them but survived.

The cocktails were also really good. I wish I remembered what I had but they were different than what is posted in the menu now. I remember they tried a green Cesar that my group laughed reminded us of our morning green smoothies. That wasn't a bad thing to be honest, we felt like we were drinking in our health while getting our alcohol in.

We didn't get to try the doughnuts as they sold out (we were the last sitting at 9:30pm). But the staff was nice enough to hook us up with the Tiger cocktail and a piece of doughnut each to try.

I'm looking forward to going back and won't hesitate to invite my less adventurous friends along. There's something for everyone here and its a nice space."}
{"text":"The start to a great night. Mr. Flamingo is a welcome addition and extension to the already established night spot, Bambi's (same owners) right below it.

Our group was seated at the front of the house near the windows and the service was great. Sommelier Jamie Drummond (of the former Jamie Kennedy Wine Bar) came out and introduced himself and let us know that he would be of service to our table whenever we were curious about something. He checked in a few times and was pleasant and helpful.

Wines and cocktails were good and the food was pretty tasty as well. I tried a bunch of dishes and particularly enjoyed: 

-the smoked trout with dill cream and braised red cabbage
-the risotto with all kinds of crazy wild mushrooms and truffle
-the lobster baked oysters with tobiko pickled celery and shallot
-the fresh made donut with caramel, apples and cream. 

I also loved the pickled red onion that they put on many dishes and am now inspired to make it myself. A few of my dining companions particularly liked the veal T-Bone with périgueux sauce and the brown butter gnocchi with octopus and gremolata. 

The burrata was the only slight disappointment (I usually love this cheese) - where was the creamy soft centre? Next time I'll try the seared scallops with movie-theatre popcorn sauce and sea apparagus and the Korean hot pot. 

There was a local dj playing enjoyable disco and house tracks and we nicely transitioned into a night of revelling, first at Bambi's below, and then at an artfully done Mansion-led Foundry event further south. A 5 star night kicked off by our new friend, Mr. Flamingo."}
{"text":"Lame place with psycho waitress calling people drunk! We werent even typsy. Came running at me saying i cant look at her the way i did. We left right away! Scary!!!"}
{"text":"Group of 12 - + 2 interlopers near the end. (one Vegetarian) 

Beverages had by me: Hawaiian Ryan & Rum Runner Dans Cure all - and Hold the Mescal cocktails. Plus a bottle of wine. Everyone else had wine, cocktails and many many beers and shots.  (The fancy cocktails took 10+ mins because they are complicated Just FYI)

I deduct a half a star for lack of Coffee or tea - half the group was quite put out by that. 

The Spiced olives: Never had this variety- I want to only consume these for the rest of my life, tasted like pure butter. I hope to be entombed on my death in a vat filled with these.  
Burrata with broccoli and Mushrooms: Delicate, light, fresh and savory with a bright finish. Nicely balanced with hints of truffle. 
the Escarole Salad: Didn't like, but I do not like Escarole, everyone else ate it and seemed thrilled. 
House smoked trout - Gently smoked, vibrant hollandaise, a crowd pleaser, the cucumber was my fave part of it. 
Butternut Squash Risotto - this was made for a crowd - I was pleasantly surprised with how moist and melty it was. People were licking the bowl. it was gross, my friends are animals. 
The Sizzling Rib Eye steak with mushrooms: BEAUTIFUL - perfectly cooked - Rare to med, (though I'm a blue kinda gal, for a group this was ideal) the sauce was enhancing of the flavour without taking away from the meat tastes, and the mushrooms were crisp and sweet. 
 
And there was two special dishes for our vegetarian - a Cauliflower starter and a pasta with mushrooms - She was blown away - and this is a picky lady. 

Finally - Dessert: Donut - I do not like dessert that much generally, this made no impression on me. 

Decor/Ambiance: Friday night, its packed, its loud, but still romantic and a good place for a double date. it's open kitchen and the bathrooms are just fine. 

Service: I was with a group and was very impressed with the service, VERY! from the booking to the drinks to the servers attending us. Aloof and attentive= Perfect! Never wanted for anything, very good at preemptively knowing when we needed things. 

I would recommend this place for any event, but especially those looking for an interesting meal with a great service in a pretty setting."}
{"text":"We were a group of 8 at Mr. Flamingo last Saturday night - keep in mind that if you are planning on coming with a larger group, make sure you book far enough in advance as the restaurant is small, with limited seating. 

At the time of booking, we mentioned we were coming to celebrate for a bachelorette and the host on the phone said that they would do something nice to honour the celebration.....this was not followed through on. 

The service was more or less acceptable - The food arrived hot, and in a timely fashion. The server was kind, but seemed a bit bored or as though his head was somewhere else. I'm not deducting stars because of this - for all we know he could have been having a bad day. 

We ordered a bunch of things to share for the table: 
Steak Tartare - very good - served with potato chips 
Salad - I forget what kind it was as one person ordered for the whole table - the presentation was nothing special, but it was yummy 
Mushroom Risotto - comfort food, nice texture, good flavour 
Eggplant Parm - we had ordered just one for the table, and ending up ordered 2 more. 
Smoked Trout - kind of like a corn chowder with nice-sized chunks of fish. Sweet and delicious. 

The place is quite loud so I wouldn't recommend going if this isn't your thing. The menu changes often too. 

This was my second time at Mr. Flamingo and I would consider returning!"}
{"text":"Went for my sisters bday, they have a plating fee if you bring in dessert even though they only provide two desserts. Service was good, food was pretty salty, the ceviche and octopus were too salty.. other than two dishes, I felt very parched after eating them. Rib eye was delicious and sister enjoyed their cocktail."}
{"text":"It was a group of 5 of us for a bachelorette party and we had everything from the oysters down on the menu. It was all fantastic. Great flavours and dishes in general. My favourites would have to be the burratta and the grilled octopus salad, but all the others were really good too! The cocktails were also awesome and the staff was incredibly helpful and friendly!"}
{"text":"From the minute we walked in here we were treated like a burden. We were a large party who had a reservation. Our sever was rude and openly disdainful. I worked in the service industry for 6 years. Large parties are not that hard. Our waitress was appalling. Food was good. Service was a complete disgrace. I have never met a waitress so terrible. She was rude to us when we walked in. She didn't tell anyone that the bill was auto grated. I tipped an additional 20 percent. I got a text 2 mins later from another guest from our party informing us. Went back to get our additional 20% and was treated with rudeness AGAIN. 

The waitress was named Ariella and I HAVE NEVER IN MY LIFE BEEN TREATED SO RUDELY. 

SHAME BECAUSE THE FOOD WAS GOOD"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a great dinner, was unexpectedly pleased with our dishes. The scallop ceviche was standout, along with the steak. Our party of four shared a variety of dishes, including the donut - yum! Was irritated by our server, who looked surly and was hard to get the attention of. Did not appreciate being ignored and eventually went to the bar to get my second drink. If the owners invested in the service, this place could be a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Never even heard of this place until last Wednesday when I googled \"buck a shuck Toronto Wednesday\" and it popped up in a random article.

The space itself is small and sunny...we weren't able to snag a table but the bar suited us just fine. The oysters themselves were totally awesome...very fresh and delicious. But even more impressive was the cocktail selection and execution by the lovely bartender. This guy knows his mixology. The drinks were great.

I overheard said bartender singing praises over the burrata so we decided to order that along with the gnocchi (with pea puree, mushrooms and ricotta). Both dishes were tasty but next time I would try the cod cheeks or smoked trout.

All told, this is a great bet for cocktails, buck-a-shucks and then some...."}
{"text":"We were a party of 11 and the service was simply awful. The manager was very rude when I asked if we could squeeze one more person at the table and he said no despite the fact that there was plenty of room. The server was terrible yet there was a 20% gratuity added which she did not deserve whatsoever. We also weren't allowed to split the bill which is extremely annoying, we had to do the math on who ordered what and I'm pretty sure we were also overcharged based on our math."}
{"text":"Good choice on the Dundas West-near-Ossington strip. Food was great but nothing particularly, all caps WOW. The staff was a bit low energy but nice. Menu had a variety of seafood options which is nice. Only one dessert. Good cocktails. Glad we tried it however it doesn't make my must-eat or must-experience list."}
{"text":"Hipster heaven! 20 bucks cocktails! Why not!


Always appreciate new places but way overpriced relative to experience/quality of food not to mention that you will be covered in kitchen smoke if you seat close to it.  250 per couple can get you a meal in the fanciest restos in Toronto.  If feels like there is a free for all these days..."}
{"text":"Came here for a date on a Friday night, no issues grabbing a seat at the bar even though this place is small. 

It was cinco de mayo so the $5 Margarita special was on and it was really tasty! We had a few of those before trying something else. I tried a gin cocktail and he had a whiskey cocktail --I forget what the names were but both were great. 

I'll be back to try other drinks for sure!"}
{"text":"Hmm, this is a really tough 3 star to give. But I will conclude below.

Upon entering, the place looks somewhat modest, a small place with a bar and seating for maybe 30 or so.  Dark, and a tad hipster.  Certainly trendy - I assume you'd find seating tough on the weekends. Staff was very good - friendly and tolerant of my mildly funny, yet boarder line lame jokes :D

We had a couple cocktails - very good - but relatively standard for the type of place - let's call it the modern prohibition, generally vodka free theme -Yum Yum.

We had the lobster baked oysters, steak tartare, seared scallops and hamachi.

In order of greatness:

1) oysters - this is a must get - 4 delicious lobster topped oysters with a wonderful hollandaise sauce.
2) seared scallops - the movie theatre popcorn sauce was so right on it almost hurt
3) hamachi - solid, higher level sashimi grade
4) steak tartare - still quite good, never my fave, it was my dinner mates selection.

3-star? what? well the pricing / volume was what hurt, tapas still is never cheap but we left slightly hungry after ordering $60 of food. I just can't stomach that  :p
The food was really good - aren't we just spoiled in this city now.

They have a donut for dessert, we didn't have it but it was tempting to see it. Even if it is 6x the cost of a Timmies donut.

Good date place and for I'd say up to 4.

Big groups probably work too - but have fun sorting out the bill!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent. The wait staff was good as well. We had the oysters, the strip loin diablo, the tartare, the ceviche, the eggplant and the burratta. You should definitely try the strip loin, tartare and the burrata. Overall every dish was well composed and had an amazing balance of flavours. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"It's as good as it gets with Mr Flamingo! Great food atmosphere and service. The restaurant has bar-ish feel to it, keeping the atmosphere lively which is always good. Good selection of beers and cocktails to choose from and the diversity of dishes we had were very well made.

We were a group of four and shared a number of plates. The Korean Hot Pot and the Veal were my favourite. A quick summary would be that they have a variety of flavours and each done very well. The portions are on the smaller side and designed to share, but it gives you the opportunity to try a few more dishes."}
