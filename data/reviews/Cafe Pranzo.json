{"text":"Café PRANZO is Located inside Venue 8600. Not only is it surprisingly cute for a business cafe, but food is also fresh and delicious! We once had a meeting in their conference room here and the café had a nice spread of cheese's, meats, hummus, fresh veggies and fruit for us. They also had a small selection of wines and beers. They informed us that the Café would be open to the public. I finally decided to give this place a try. I called, ordered ahead and walked over. After a short 10 minute walk I went up to the counter to find my meal ready to take back to my office. There were a variety of sweet treats up at the counter as well. I asked the woman behind the counter about them and she said \"Oh yes I baked these this morning!\" She wafted the smell of fresh baked cookies my way. How I was able to resist I have no idea. I was eyeballing that fresh cinnamon roll though, for the next time I have a sweet tooth in the morning. Yup, that's right. They are open for breakfast. They also have Fresh Brewed Coffee's , Cappuccino's and Teas. I finally sit down at my desk to enjoy my Rosemary Chicken Salad With Provolone Panini Sandwich with Side Salad and ranch. I was in love at first bite! I just don't think that I was expecting an excellent meal. Crunchy bacon, plenty of fresh slices of avocado, and heaping with chicken salad. The Ranch was creamy and looks house made and the salad was fresh and crisp. I ended up only eating 1/2 of my sandwich and saving the rest for the next day. 

I cant wait to come back and try that freshly baked cinnamon roll with a nice cup of Cappuccino. I am definitely making this my new go to lunch spot. With fresh ingredients like that, the convenience of location, the decent prices, and friendly staff... How could I not!?"}
{"text":"Café Pranzo is a nice Lunch place, hidden in an office building, offering up some good food at reasonable prices.  

I was in one of the other buildings in the complex and someone suggested going to a cafeteria nearby.  Well, this is the cafeteria and you wouldn't know it's here, because there is no exterior signage. See the pretty build with no exterior sign (photo). 

I ordered the Turkey with Pesto on Marble Rye (photo) and it was really very good. It came with a side of Salad, or a bag of Chip for $9.70, which all seemed like a good deal given the sized of the sandwich. 

You might need to use Yelp Maps to find this place, but it's well worth it. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I eat at the cafe often and encourage anyone in the Scottsdale airpark to check it out.  Food is freshly made and the atmosphere is great with many different places to sit including the very large outdoor patio.  I love the salads and I usually eat half for lunch and save the rest for dinner since they are extremely generous."}
{"text":"I use to love this place. The lady that used to work there her name was Ana was very helpful, remembered my order and my name. I haven't been back in awhile. I have a 30 minute lunch break and I'm usually In and out. Yesterday I tried calling in my order, no answer. I called three times no response. They close at two so I had a small window. Instead I dropped in. The woman at the counter was helping three other ladies whom had separate orders. She ignored me, didn't say one word. I sat at the counter waiting my turn. She then proceeded to have small talk with them, taking their individual payments and walked into the back room. Still no acknowledgement. waiting patiently, she comes back and gets all their drinks. As she continues to walk back to the kitchen. She looks at me and says I'll be with you soon. Leaves and doesn't come back. At that point I had been waiting for over 15 minutes with a 30 minute break. I decided I'm not going to eat lunch today and returned to work frustrated. Considering it's a small cafe in a prominent business park and in a office building you'd think customer service and a courtesy for people's time would be important. I'm never coming back."}
{"text":"This place is adorable! I'll admit I was resistant at first bc I assumed it would be expensive, and wasn't sure if it would be good. I was sooooooooo wrong! I'm addicted to the rosemary chicken salad panini, and their potato salad is out of this world! A lot of the people in my class had to get a fresh baked brownie every day because they claimed they were absolutely amazing! I've eaten here many times, and usually called in my order on the road or emailed it in, and they always had it ready! Their cappuccinos are the real deal!!!"}
{"text":"Great menu, good quality food and the decor is very comfortable and modern. Check it out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Cafe Pranzo is not only close to work for me (walking distance), it is also in the Scottsdale Association of Realtors bldg., so it does have quite an impressive modern café ambiance. Was quite impressed by the simplicity of the menu and the sandwich I had ordered (meatball sandwich on multigrain) was quite good. So, simple food options- check. Nice ambiance - check. Decent service - check. I do like the small business appeal of the café and being walking distance, saves on the economy of time, driving away from work.and waiting in line...prices are a bit higher than the next sandwich shop but the quality is better. Goodbye Subway! ;-)"}
