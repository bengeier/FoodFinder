{"text":"Date 29th April 
Time of Visit: 11:45pm 

Really bad and foul tasting cheese dip provided with chips (I have this regularly so I know its taste very well). They refused to refund me and when I asked to speak to store manager she refused to speak to me (when she was clearly visible to me but she decided to not to speak to me).

We regularly go to this location to dine. But today I went to this location with some of my friends, the restaurant was very dirty from inside. The floor was full of food dearie and there were also some used hand gloves near the make table. 

Saw one of the staff members cleaning one of the equipments with sanitizer cloth but I noticed 3 times she went back to the make table to serve customer and she was touching food surface and food containers as well as salsa scoop without washing her hands. 

I work at restaurant so I noticed this issue right away. I also saw other employees doing similar things. Even the taste of food was not similar to other locations. I don't think I will be going to this location again."}
{"text":"Took about 10 minutes from ordering to eating @12:30pm....clean place, fast service, fresh ingredients. 

Ordered the small haddock burrito. Must have weighed a couple of pounds, filled with all the works!  Delicious, satisfying and one of the best burritos around."}
{"text":"One of the worst eating experiences I've ever had. The cow must have been 50 when it was made into streak. Just awful."}
{"text":"I love Burrito Boyz but this particular location has a cashier who literally provides the most rude, robotic service that I've seen in a long time. I don't need my cashier to go above and beyond, but a \"thank you\" or greeting would be great. Again, I generally love the service and food that I get at most Burrito Boyz locations, but this location needs to make sure their employees are taught some of the fundamentals of customer service. Also, this is not just a one time occurrence; this staff member seems to be in a bad mood on the multiple occasions I've been to this location. 

My Large Chicken burrito on whole wheat was as delicious as usual though.

{"text":"Had a small chicken burrito from here, and it was massive! They are so so so good, but their hot sauce is serious, do not get more than 5 lines (unless you're crazy like me). The wait time is quite long, but definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"The most overrated Mexican place. I don't know why people enjoy this franchise so much. There are definitely better and much more authentic Mexican food experiences in vaughan alone. I've frequented many times to try different things but it's almost never good. The rice is hard and chewy most of the times I've been there. The chicken burrito is disgusting they use a ground chicken, it's terrible as are most the meats. The nachos they give are overly salty. The only item I like somewhat on the menu is the halibut burrito which is decent but the rest is terrible."}
{"text":"By far my favourite Burrito joint in the GTA. Even though all the Burrito Boyz are owned by the same person, this is the only location I will ever go back to. I gave up on the Brampton Queen Street location. Consistently screwing up on my order. It was getting beyond pathetic. Even the serving sizes would fluctuate from week to week..... LUCKILY the Vaughan location is AMAZING. Portion sizes are always legit, food tastes good and the service is really friendly."}
{"text":"Possibly the best fish burrito I've had anywhere north of Toronto. The burritos here are MASSIVE and will definitely pack your gut with delicious rice, beans, and all the right fixings. 

Just a short review since this place is already highly acclaimed. 

Just come eat already."}
{"text":"This place had great customer service. The employees were very nice and helpful. But they put haddock in my burrito instead of halibut. I don't know how they got it wrong, my order said halibut but it definitely was not."}
{"text":"I watched youtube video from kdproduction and always wanted to come over. So excited to fibd that it opened in the north side. Absolutely one of the best, i asked for small, came out like a giant wrap. Juicy, flavourful yet not too salty!  Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"I always end up here cause I get to Holy Chuck too late, so I thought I'd give this location another try since it's next door. 

Paid $10.25, cash (Bryan) typed in $10.15. We didn't mention it to him, but make sure to double check your change - money is money. 

The plates where they prepare the burritos aren't cleaned - they just keep getting reused. I noticed dried up food (beans, sauce, etc) on those plates. I think it speaks about the bigger picture. 

Curse my hunger - never again."}
{"text":"Some people may think im crazy but I have to say I was not impressed with this location.  Although its brand new and actually very nice inside I have to say that my burrito was tasteless.  I have experienced way more from other locations.  It took a very long time for me to get my burrito also.  I will not cut this location off yet because I am a strong believer that everyone is allowed to have a bad day.  When I visit this location again I will be sure to update my review."}
{"text":"The girl taking my order was very rude and even though I repeated twice I simply wanted two containers of burrito sauce, by the time I got my food she said I can't have that and she will have to charge me and started arguing with me... even though I asked at the register for it. I did not appreciate the attitude and rudeness of the typical Woodbridge girl at the cash. Should probably screen employees a little better for customer service."}
{"text":"Honestly one of the best burrito places. Service is spectacular, even when it's busy they do their best to keep things moving along efficiently. My quesadilla was crispy and everything was fresh. Also I've never seen calamari offered before and it was SOOO GOOD. They are constantly restocking their ingredients and their guacamole is bless. Will keep returning!!!"}
{"text":"It's my first time at Boyz and I still like Chipotle's better.  Chipotle's burritos have better taste and white  rice is much better flavored with lime taste.  Value wise, it will be $$-$$$.

The place including the toilets is not clean.  I needed to clear the crumps on the table before I could set my food down.  How could we trust the food if the place is not clean?"}
{"text":"Parking: Free - Huge lot

Venue: Big enough, has a diner feel to it.

Washrooms: Small.

Experience: When there`s a biker(motorcycle) meet at this place, they treat our kind of people well. Bang for the buck burrito, I went with their vegetarian soy, though I must say they should have more sauces to top it off with, there were plenty of flavours in their burrito but they go bland after a while. High rating was for the good service. Food was A-OK.

I return to this place for their sweet potato burritos."}
{"text":"This location is spacious and clean; tons of parking and seating.

Burrito Boyz is probably the one of my favourite burrito places; the haddock burrito is my go-to. Their burritos are stuffed to the brim and perfectly pressed for a crisp outer. I love how Burrito Boyz layers their toppings evenly and pack it in really tight so that the burrito does not come falling apart as soon as you take the first bite. An extra bonus is that they have guac with no extra charge :)

Only downside is that they make your protein choice to order..so the wait can take anywhere from 5-15 minutes depending on how busy it is!"}
{"text":"Tried the shrimp Burrito today with my son.  It was our first time.  Son ordered the steak burrito.  We were actually amazed at the taste and the price.  I thought for the price it was an awesome deal.   It appears they have just about every burrito on the menu for everyone's taste.   It was busy when we were there at dinner but my son is young and not as impatient as me.  It was worth the wait.  I will go there again that is for sure."}
{"text":"Not sure why such a low rating (well, I didn't read any of the reviews) but this place is perfect for burritos and pricing. We got the steak and shrimp burritos. They were done perfectly and the steak was tender (for the price). I'm not sure what else you can ask for!

Go for: perfectly done burritos with a million options

Don't go for: just try it for yourself before deciding not to come here"}
{"text":"Out of the Burrito Boyz I've tried, this one is just 'alright'.

My go-to is the halibut naked burrito. Staff is very friendly, but I found that the portion of halibut is a lot smaller than that served at Yonge and Finch location. This place is great beacuse they are open late, have great eats, and good location. 

I have experienced better Burrito Boyz locations."}
{"text":"Came here because I felt like a burrito, however I was disappointed. The service was slow but it was lunch time-what can you expect when you're part of the lunch rush. They tried to skip out on adding all the ingredients that makes a burrito. Everything they put on I had to ask for. They also put in very little (especially the cheese and guac).  

They have a combo of having chips and a drink with your burrito. The chips is just tortillas with any sauce you want: salsa, guac, burrito sauce, or sour cream. 

The restaurant itself was clean, no messy tables, no spills. 

They also have free wifi! Password is 1122334455 . Parking is available for free, it is in a plaza."}
{"text":"Big Burritos... they got those. Guack... they got those... beans and rice they got those!!! What can I say it's Burrito Boyz... your getting what you expect. The best? Almost... hype? All day!! Since there's no other competition or burrito joints in the area it is definitly a go to for Burritos... 

Big spacious joint, the staff is busy whenever I see them... there's tons of pros about this place. Very little cons... I got the steak and the Biggest size and I was full to the max couldn't believe it...

Hmmm making this shorter than my other reviews because this place doesn't need to say too much you need to try it for yourself..."}
{"text":"Quality and taste have really gone down. Order a chicken and a steak burito tonight and they were both bland. One was hot and one was 2x extra hot but never were spicy at all. Think that will be my last trip there."}
{"text":"This used to be my favourite place to get a burrito in Vaughan. But recently they have reduced their portion sizes of the chicken burrito/bowl and also added a fee to get guacamole on your burrito. That was one of my incentives to come here but now since that's been removed, there's nothing unique about this chain.  The burrito is good and offer a variety of toppings to add on; I've had better.

The utensils given to eat there are cheap (like dollar store cheap) and the same can be said of their napkins. Overall, this chain has turned into a one and done and should take a look back into the mirror to see what they once were when they first opened."}
{"text":"4.5 stars.
I've realized I've been far too hard on this place....I mean how bad can it be that I've gone back 12 times in the last 3 months. 
The word has gotten out and the place can get very busy. Staff seem to keep their cool. 
IMO, still the best burrito out there, although I'm now hooked on their quesadilla. Their hot sauce has got a great punch of heat.
Place is always clean."}
{"text":"Everything was fantastic, food was fresh and well prepared. Every time I eat a burrito at this place feel like my first time, which is excellent!! 
Highly recommend, The burrito is made with quality ingredients every time, tastes fresh,  prepared constantly so your experience is the same every time. Burritos themselves are heavy, well packed and yummy! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"At laaaaaaast, my love has come alooooong. 

It is no mystery to anyone who knows me that I love burritos. Lunch, dinner, 2am run: whatever the time, I am game for a burrito. Moving out of Brampton an hour north meant not only did I not have a decent burrito place nearby, but I also lost a few pounds. (Some might rejoice, I did not: a girl needs burritos in her life.) So when I realized this place was opening all of 10 minutes away from my office, I plotted my perfect route and waited patiently for the opening day.

The burritos are what you expect from any of the Burrito Boyz chains, hot, fresh and made to order. This place also features a Drive Thru option, but I'm not sure how it works yet. It's situated in a great location in Vaughan making it a great option for lunch during the work week. 

I still live 40 minutes from my beloved, but it beats hoping onto the 407 to sink my teeth into one of these. I'll be back in no time!"}
