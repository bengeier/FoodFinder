{"text":"Food is incredible, fresh and great menu. Service and staff are fantastic. Everyone cares and wanted to make sure we had a great experience. Can't say enough good things about this place. 5 stars."}
{"text":"What a fantastic surprise! We stopped into Souk Tabule after going to the new YMCA on Cherry St. We didn't know what to expect. We are big fans of Tabule on Queen St., East, and go there frequently. Souk Tabule did not disappoint. This location is more casual - you order and pay upfront at the counter, then sit down. That aside, the food is up to its usual excellent standards. We had the chef's sampler platter. For $16 you get a selection of dips with a side order of Middle Eastern coleslaw. One of the dips, muhamara, is something neither one of us had ever had. Based on red peppers, walnuts and breadcrumbs, it was truly spectacular. We rounded dinner off with an order of Jedos kefta meatballs.  Served with a side order of aromatic rice, the meatballs were wonderful, accompanied by a homemade tomato sauce. In fact, everything here is homemade. That includes the delicious pita bread, made at the counter in front of you while you wait. All that for $32. A great deal and delicious dinner. To top it off, the service was prompt and friendly. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great casual dining. We were a large group and you have to self-serve your order which is great. Food is remarkable. The beef shwarma is the best I have had! Definitely going here again! Prices are also reasonable!"}
{"text":"Souk Table was a big let down.  The room is beautiful and airy with ample light.  It is too bad that the self serve food was tasteless and luke warm.   You pay for your food first and then you sit at a table and wait to retrieve your own food and beverage and carry it back to your table. No one checks in to see how your meal was or if you would care for another drink. It really is a self serve cafeteria charging exoribant prices! Find your way to Paramount Restaurants, they know how to treat their customers!"}
{"text":"Let me first qualify my review by stating my focus on the total experience of dining than merely the consumables (food & drink).   I love this place. The owner must have a great sensibility to aesthetics and the totality of experience. This \"souk\" is a rendition of a nostalgic concept of the past bazaars: It begins by a close-up browsing of various middle-eastern preserves and spices. The browsing itself fires up imagination and recollects joyous memories of souks or traditional markets.     Make sure you pay homage to \"Cafe Younes\" as you step in more. You'll see what I mean.   It then welcomes you to a tableau--a mosaic of letters that comprise the menu. You really do not want to rush placing your order because your eyes keep getting invited to various parts of the menu. For someone who is not familiar with middle-eastern cuisine, the words and names could appear cheeky. But the serving staff masterfully engage with you, help you stay on the tableau and just pepper insights onto your read of the menu.  I ordered a few items, not knowing if it were too much. The server affirmed that I might have ordered too much; she suggested a mild modification.   Next, you are drawn toward the show of a time-old craft: baking. You watch, in awe and admiration, the deceivingly simple stretching of the dough, the pasting of the pie to the hot oven, and the sizzling bubbling of the bread. Stop and watch the whole show: The breads get neatly folded, stacked on top of one-another, and placed in souk-type baskets.   Once you sit at a table (plenty of which are around, and no two are similar in view), you are drawn to nibbles of crafts plastered on various spots on the walls, placed in charming orders on tables, or displayed without hesitation on the northern shelves. Just browse. Stay curious.   In short order the food arrives. If you are in a rush, make sure you have your \"number\" sitting up right. You know what I mean soon enough.   The food is--ah--yum. I'll let others write about the food itself. To me, simply \"yum\" will do; I want to continue experience the place while I am enjoying the yummies.   Do not rush out the door. Go back and order tea. There is a subtle difference (as I discovered) between Moroccan tea and Lebanese tea. Rest back, let it infuse. Bite on a date pastry while you keep observing the patrons of this mediterranean market. Say hi to the next-table neighbour. Strike a conversation.  This is what a souk ought to be!   To the owner(s) and manager(s): THANK YOU."}
{"text":"very nice surroundings and great friendly staff reasonable and delicious food"}
{"text":"Had a great Sunday lunch experience at Souk Tabule.  Came with the family and it had a great relaxing, casual setting.  You seat yourself and order at the counter.  they provide you with a number and the food is brought to your table.  We tried many delicious dishes - Beet Salad ($6), Babaganuj (came with 1 pita $6, ordered additional pita for $1), Falafel (baked or fried, 6 for $6), Open Face Beef Shwarma ($10) and Phoenician Fries ($5.50).  The food was served pretty quickly and the staff was very friendly.  They offer many more food selection and lots of tea/coffee and desserts.  I will have to return to try everything else.  We arrived around 11:45am but it was a packed house by noon."}
{"text":"Amazing food and wonderful staff! The Muhamara Drip (Walnut and red pepper) and the Saj Pita with labni, zaatar, and vegetables were unbelievable! The market also has some great finds including some of the best olive oil. Will definitely go back again to eat and shop."}
{"text":"Great fresh Lebanese food. Falafel comes out freshly fried (you can have it baked instead). Try the chefs sampler. Mezze of tabouleh, labneh, babaghanoush, and some tasty red dish. The lentil is mild and nicely on the thin side. Espresso coffees available. Their pita is made in front of you and is more like a thin tasty tortilla. Order at the counter, they deliver. If you hate children or public displays of affection this is not your place. I've been here twice. I want to try their rice pudding but I'm too full with finishing their other dishes."}
{"text":"Love the chef's sampler! Have also had the Beirut pulled chicken and it is the bomb! Haven't really tried anything else because I'm addicted to those two dishes but I'll update the review if I ever try anything else. Cute place, lots of stuff to look at."}
{"text":"The food, the ambience and the value are phenomenal!   It's definitely not a full dine-in experience, as you order food at the counter and it is then brought by kitchen staff once ready. Nevertheless, the service is quick and friendly.   Now, the food is outstanding! My partner and I ordered the Sampler Platter and the Phoenician Fries. Both dishes were vegetarian, filling and very yummy. I have to say we were both pleasantly surprised.   I will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"If your looking for bad experience in Toronto just simply step a foot to this place!  Unbelievably rude staff! with less than ok service. The other day we went there as group at 8:30pm and we order,keep in mind that their closing time is 9. The staff guy took our order smiling and then send it out as take away! We \"obviously\" asked he say that any order after 8:15 will always be out as take away. We accept and start eating,after exactly 10 mins he reach to us saying that \"he need this table\" and stood there waited for us to leave!  My friend politely asked him to give us 5 minutes and we will be going, he just simply refused and kept on looking at us!   I would accept any thing from a restaurant other than being rude to the costumes!!  100% will not think of stepping a foot there nor recommending it to anybody."}
{"text":"Love this place. Definitely get the tasting platter and pida (it's freshly made in house!). The portions are quite generous and we always have left overs to take home. I love their desserts too!   Souk tabule is so beautiful inside and never too busy so perfect place to catch up friends without having to yell over loud music or lots of people. A great addition to Canary district."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. I've been about 5 times now, and each time we bring someone new to check it out.   Souk Tabule has an awesome atmosphere and cool decor, but the real winner is their Labni. I look forward to it everytime I go. Other awesome dishes are the Arnabeet, which is some sort of delicious fried cauliflower as well as the falafel dish with rice and lentils. My favorite thing about Souk Tabule is that there are gluten-free and vegetarian options that aren't just salad. There is lots of option for both!  As for the service, you order at the front and sit down with a number. The food is brought over quickly, and all the servers are very nice and helpful. We will be back many more times in the future!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has been on my list for quite a while; its Mediterranean brunch options seem highly appetizing. Upon entering, I was wowed by this super quaint, instagrammable, and well-lit restaurant. The seats are quite spacious, and you can be seated quite comfortably with friends. You pay for your food at the counter, and the waitresses deliver to your table.  I got the shakshuka (I've made it at home, but have never had it outside), while my cousins got the Jedos Kefta Meatballs and the Samke Sammie/Wrap.  Shashuka: Three eggs were cooked perfectly in a red stew of tomato and red pepper sauce. Since it was served in a cast iron skillet, the dish came piping hot; however, it soon cooled down quickly. The shashuka has a strong tomato flavour, and you can distinctly taste the cumin and smoked paprika spices. Having attempted to make this dish at home before, I was pleasantly surprised to find that my flavour was quite identical! The labni on top was a sour cream like dressing that helped balance the flavour. There was also a thin slice of saj pita that was served on the side. I loved how thin it was, and it was the ideal vessel for scooping up the sauce. That said, my absolute favourite was the egg - I only hope that it were more runny, but the egg was still soft boiled with a golden centre.  Jedos Kefta Meatballs: I was able to sample a bit of the lamb and beef meatballs - the flavour was gamey and quite delicious! My cousin said his favourite was the dirty rice (rice stir fried with ground beef) - it seemed to be very flavourful and fragrant indeed!  Samke Wrap: I believe that it would be more accurate to name this dish \"Arabic slaw served with Arabic slaw\". The battered cod was wrapped with the purple vinegary slaw and tomatoes in a pita, and dressed with spicy tahini sauce. However, over half of the wrap consisted of the slaw! To add to that, there was a generous mound of slaw served as an accompanying side. The slaw had a lemon garlic dressing (the lemon flavour was far stronger than the garlic), and was a very pretty purple pink colour.  Overall, I think we all enjoyed our individual dishes quite a bit. The main complaint was only that the samke wrap had too much of the Arabic slaw, making the flavour quite overbearing and too much. That aside, I did enjoy my dish - particularly as I realize that my own homemade version isn't too far off at all! :)"}
{"text":"What a gem of a place. The food is delicately crafted. Full of alive flavors, yet subtle. All the ingredients are fresh, well sourced and the meals come out of the chefs hands in Ferrari pace. Pretty unbelievable. We are staying close by for 8 days and it's been Lebanese food all day, every day. Can't get enough of this fare. Just wish they were present back home in Southern California. Toronto is lucky to have such original ethnic food with a clean, modern spin."}
{"text":"Amazing spot and child friendly!  High chairs and a change table in a very clean bathroom.  The food is authentic and packed full of flavour. Prices are very reasonable for the quality and atmosphere.  We will definately return."}
{"text":"This has become one of my favourite spots to get any meal of the day because it's so flavourful and there are many healthy options. The service is friendly, and the space is beautiful - even the bathrooms are lovely!"}
{"text":"FINALLY!!! great authentic food. Creative. Cool Beirut touch. Fries are perfection. Tabouleh?? Finally someone does it good. Would've loved more than one piece of saj bread. Overall amazing. Will defo be back. For any vegan out there - there PLENTY to eat."}
{"text":"A good and modern take on middle eastern food. Very traditional in the way everything is prepared. Fresh and layered food. The one star is off because of the portion size. I think they can do better for the price range. Very child&stroller friendly. Will be back!"}
{"text":"This is a new area for moi as I haven't been to this new residential developments before. My friends who are fans of Tabule formal restaurants recommended this spot for a late brunch. Even though we were quite late the place was almost packed.  We ordered a baba ganoush to share and I ordered a shakshuka.  The space is nice and open with high high ceiling and a baking area for fresh bread (can be addictive even if its not great!). The ordering system is geared towards keeping the guest moving which is fine.  The baba ganoush is done the traditional way (though I have become partial to the me va me version) the bread isn't the traditional pita and they served all our bread with the app. So we had to order more for the mains.  The shakshuka is decent. Served in a cast iron pan it has a rustic feel to it. The zaatar added a nice element to the dish as well. A nice dish for a reasonable price. My eyes also caught the sujuck and bastarma eggs (big fan of both). I will revisit as its a solid 4 star for this price point. Mini update tried the sujjuck omelette on the second visit. Sujjuck is milder which I expected given their clientele. Ok I suppose. Tried the Muhammara mezze as well which was good."}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere. Reasonable prices for high quality fresh food. Been back twice.    The salmon on dirty rice is exceptional, as is the mezze dip with walnuts. Skip the pita with veggies, sounds and looks better than it tastes.   Really good Turkish coffee."}
{"text":"Went to Souk for the first time last week.  The food was delicious - quality ingredients and very unique.  We had the muhammara dip, the saj with za'atar, labni and vegetables, the baked falafel and the ful.  Everything was really fresh, well seasoned and very tasty.  The ful could have used a bit more lemon, but staff were happy to bring lemon wedges for us.  This is a wonderful space, beautiful design concepts and brightly lit during the day.  It's obvious the owners have put a lot of hard work into the place and the food they produce.  I would highly recommend Souk - it's my new favourite place to eat!"}
{"text":"Went to spend some time at Corktown Common Park stumbled upon this place -- we were pleasantly surprised, very delicious food! Fantastic Lebanese food :)"}
{"text":"I love this place so much! It's casual dining - you just go up to order and they bring it to you. Really like this place for the food (obviously) and the decor is such a nice bonus. I shared an appetizer platter with my friend and it came with a variety of dips. It tasted really fresh and it was incredibly filling. Prices for main dishes were not too expensive either. I'd definitely go again and would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"The food was great and the menu is brimming with options--options, I say--for vegetarian and gluten free folks. The portion sizes are very generous and tasty, though we found a few items to be just a tad too spicy. It would be nice to know, for example, that the hummus (which is quite good) has a very spicy oil pooled on top of it. I would have requested to leave it off. My only main criticism was that the water cups were not clean, and while it's great to have a water station, I wound up using my own water bottle because most of the cups had gritty food residue on them. The table service was efficient but I wouldn't call it attentive. But overall, a solid experience."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food here. Quality infredients, delicious, cosy casual contemporary ambience..."}
{"text":"Clean, trendily decored, yet comfortable and family friendly. Come for a relaxing lunch meal with friends or alone. The food will leave no conversation to be conducted. But worry not, the fast casual dining service means you will not be pressured to leave.  The pita bread is a delight! Come warm and freshly made, you can even see the chef making it on a pillow (!!) by the counter. Highly recommend 'Chef's Platter' even if you are by yourself. You will have enough for another meal."}
{"text":"THE FOOD- My colleagues & I got takeout for lunch from here. The food (like at Tabule) is delicious & filling however the menu is a bit different (and smaller) than Tabule. My shawarma was very tender and flavorful although I wish they would have let me put a few fries in it, in true Middle Eastern style. I was told I could only get a side of fries. We also got falafel & beet hummus to share and both tasted fresh & tasty.  THE DRINK- They have an interesting selection of independent natural pops. I had a black cheery soda that was yummy!  THE SPACE- The seating is fairly limited, it is more of a takeout place, it's a very nice space with a modern Middle Eastern vibe.  THE SERVICE- We got takeout so not much to say on this front other than the takeout service was efficient, probably only took about 15 mins."}
{"text":"Would definitely come back. I want to try the entire menu!  Food: 4.5/5 - the chef's sampler was amazing and great for sharing. The jedos kefta meatballs were flavourful and went great with the \"dirty rice\". I wasn't a fan of the shahuka but my friends were so there were no problems with cleaning the plate.   Service: 5/5 the restaurant is laid back, cafeteria style where you order from the counter, grab a number and sit at your table and the food gets dropped off. That didn't stop the staff from coming by and checking on our table occasionally. They were very friendly and accommodating and even gave us extra bread for free."}
{"text":"We go there for brunch very often, at least once a month if not more. It is half service, meaning you order at the front and take a number, they bring the food to your table. It is best if you order a bunch of stuff and try them out. The Haloumi on a Briouche is to die for along with all of their Saj wraps. They only thing is that they give one piece of bread with one spread order (like humus) which is not enough. They also have a small section for unique grocery items that are imported."}
{"text":"My casual bday dinner choice at the end of January 2017... spot on. All of the food was amazing. No let downs at all. The chef's sampler was split between three of us, and it was amazing. Falafel over rice (I opted for a swap out to the dirty rice and was so happy with my choice) was amazing.  The falafels were crispy fried perfectly cooked (I can't handle dry falafel). The bean rice that the plate is originally paired with was well enjoyed by the boy, too. Grilled salmon kebab over rice was delicious as well (it was my bday-of course I tried bites of everyone else's dishes).  The little shop at the front of the place is super neat. Lovely spices, jams (rose jam... look no further) and cookbooks. We need to go back to try one of their specialty coffees... really want to know what the cardamom latte is like. Don't walk... run! This place is amazing. ** we went back- cardamom honey latte was divine. Jasmine tea served Arab style (silver pot and wee glass with sugar) was also a hit.  I'd love to tell you what the raspberry lemonade was like, but the kid refused to give a sip and chugged that bottle back."}
{"text":"Amazing food and probably as close to traditional Lebanese food you can get in Toronto."}
{"text":"Came here last night for dinner and experienced the best. service. ever. So impressed with the friendly and interested staff here!!  We ordered the chef's sampler platter again (still highly recommend especially if you're indecisive and want to try all the appetizers in smaller amounts/tapas-style) and one of the staff members actually took the time to tell us all the ingredients in each sample. For one that he was unsure, he actually went back to the kitchen to inquire and came back to follow-up. Very caring.  The girl at the cashier answered all my long-winded questions about the dishes and ingredients (due to my dietary restrictions). I learned that hallum cheese = fried feta + mozzarella.  We ordered the Souk salad, which is pretty light and not as satisfying as other dishes since it is all vegetables - lettuce, baby kale, cucumbers, cherry tomatoes, etc with a light and summery pomegranate vinaigrette already added to the salad. If you want a heavier salad, order the canary salad (recommended by the staff), which has BAKED falafels, hummus, and tahini. The hallum on a brioche sandwich was very mediocre though from a presentation, value (small), and taste... and health standpoint. The hallum cheese is very oily from frying and small. It came with a small amount of shredded beets on the side."}
{"text":"A gem of a find. Excellent food, tea, coffee, and sweets at this restaurant. I feel at home. Everything has been my favorite at Souk Tabule.  I have not had a bad dish (I suspect I will not). In love!  Parking: lots of parking on street. Suspect this will change when the condos start to fill up.  Excellent location, feels away from downtown but on a clear day, you can see the buildings. Great area to go for a walk after your visit to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent service and great food. I came here with a group that should have annoyed any wait staff. 12 people, coming and going, different cheques, some ordering food, some not. The staff could not have been more gracious and attentive.  Our cashier, Tanya (sorry if I'm spelling your name wrong) was amazing and very helpful with helping us pick a selection of menu items. The food is really good, hot and good size portion. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Souk Tabule is more of a casual dining experience than its sibling restaurant, Tabule, on queen east. While the quality of the food is still there, at Souk you order your food at the counter and are given a number. You find a seat and they bring your order to you. The pulled chicken wrap is fabulous, and anything with their dirty rice and slaw is delicious. Some of my favourites are the tabule salad, the fried cauliflower with humus, and the beet mutable with saj pita. The location is large and seats many people, and they have now added tables outside for extra summer seating. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"If you're in Canary district stop in for some middle eastern food and black tea! They also have a delicious watermelon mint lemonade . A good spot to get some food and just chill out with friends or solo dolo"}
{"text":"It is difficult to find if you are driving around in the area looking for it, but Souk Tabule is a bright delight in the midst of a new neighbourhood. Much airy attention has been placed into the decor of this latest Tabule venture, you might be snapping away on your camera just as much as you are on the food.  Unlike the other two locations, this one takes a fast but fine casual approach (order at the front, get a number). If the elegant wall menu seems perplexing, you may want to get your hands on a paper copy for details, which they don't have many of. Then, you can watch pita bread being made, get some water from a tap near the back, or take in the sights of many faces enjoy a meal here. One of our orders took forever to arrive, and we were given some baklava as consolation.  The soujuk and eggs scramble ($11) off the brunch menu was alrighty: you got your eggs and sausage proteins mixed with a refreshing cabbage slaw. I especially enjoyed the sweet roasted tomato sauciness of their shashuka ($11), comforting just like a bowl of chili. I'm not sure how to describe the Phoenician fries ($4) though--if you think sweet potato fries are a bit weird like I do, then this one is a special kind of species in the world of fries. (They do offer regular fries tho.)  {TTC: 514 streetcar to Front East, or a short walk from the Distillery District. Either way it's a stroll to a condo at the very end of Front Street.}"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place for shish taouk if you want to pay twice as much and receive half as much as you would at any other Lebanese restaurant in the city, especially if you prefer it on the dry side."}
{"text":"I had falafel salad with arnabeet dip, hummus, fried cauliflower with tahini sauce and tawuk skewer for my guest. The falafel I chose was baked not fried and it was gluten free. It was delicious with the tahini sauce and beet dip. There were a lot of healthy GF vegan choices and I made 3 meals out of my portions by adding some raw salad, zucchini and pepper strips from home.   The only slight disappointment was the soggy cauliflower, though it came in a recycled cardboard container which was great. The containers for the two dips were made out of kryptonite and I could not get them off! My helper could, but it was tough.   Overall, great experience. I'd order again especially because they make it easy for GF vegans."}
{"text":"I found this place after reading a review in Now Toronto. Then I checked on Yelp to find over one hundred pictures for this place. I decided it's a go. While waiting for the food, I was looking again over the pictures and it struck me: over 100 pictures for this place are posted by Diana S. (the owner) pretending to be a fellow Yelper. I am thinking maybe the restaurant's website is a better place to post all the pictures and we should allow Yelp remain a user-generated platform, without spamming the site.  Now, the food was OK; not the \"very generous portions\" mentioned in the Now Toronto article, but quite tasty regular to small-sized portions (for example one \"shakshouka\" has only 3 small eggs). The food seemed fresh and made to order. I expected a more \"authentic\" experience (maybe more spices) but the restaurant proved to be quite main stream.  I also have to mention service: while relatively decent, don't expect a 5-star service or a smile on everybody's face. The credit card machine will prompt you to leave a 15% min service charge (for bringing the food to the table), but you don't have a waiter, you have to order at the counter.  I believe 3 stars is a fair review. Maybe it can get to 4 if they improve the quality of their customer service and the size of the portions."}
{"text":"Love this place. Everything is great, but the cauliflower, baked falafel, labneh and shashouka (did I spell that right?) are perennial favourites. The only knock against it is that service can be a bit hit-or-miss. Very busy for weekend brunch - you may not be able to get a seat."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, excellent service with a good selection of food. There is a flexible option of seating. It can accommodates small groups and couples. They should consider table service."}
{"text":"Went to this place not knowing what to expect...surprise surprise the food was very tasty...being from the Middle East I'm pretty picky when it comes to our food and Souk Tabule delivered ...the fresh saj bred was amazing and the mezza plates were superb...being vegan they have lots of vegan options ....one dish that did not score high on my list was the moujjadarah .... using uncle ben's rice for this dish is a big no."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Loved the food but it's definitely not authentic labenese food. It's got a modern hipster twist!   I'd definitely come back and try different dishes."}
{"text":"nice ppl, cute place, the phoenix fries are interesting, love all their wraps, so fresh and filling and awesome"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Fresh, flavourful food with friendly, casual service. In the middle of nowhere land now, but sure to be packed all day everyday as the neighborhood fills up. Definitely going to return again & again!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place as we were in the area and were looking for a place to eat. It's a sit-in restaurant, but you order and pay first at the register, they give you a number and you seat yourself, and then they bring you your food. You also get your own water, at the side. It was pretty cool as it came out of a beer tap. I never thought I'll say this but I had fun getting water.   To be honest, I had no idea what a majority of items were, when I looked at their menu on the wall. However, they had a stapled version of their menu in front of the cash register that told us what each item was. The guy at the register also recommended dishes to us. We ended up ordering a Chef's Sampler ($16) which was a variety of dips that came with 2 pitas (you could get more pitas for $3.50), Jedos Kefta Meatballs served over rice ($12), and Grilled Salmon Kebob served over rice ($13). All of which were recommended.   Portion size was alright. I would have liked a bit more meat/fish on both the rice dishes. I enjoyed the sampler plate. However, 2 pitas were not enough for all the dip available. I also don't know what the pink item was that came with all the dishes, but I would not recommend. The rice that came with the Jedos Kefta Meatballs was delicious and I liked the flavour of the salmon. The meatballs themselves were nothing special.   Service was good. The people there were friendly, and we were served quickly.   The interior was brightly lit, clean, and nicely decorated.   In all, I would come back if I were in the area."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to go and grab a deliciously prepared lunch or just a latte. Big tables, so it's great for getting work done here as well. Staff is always friendly and the atmosphere is very calming, inviting and very modern. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Firstly, I love the atmosphere of this place. I've been to all three other Tabule locations and although they're sit down restaurants, I like how this one is a pay first location. It's a lot more easy going and relaxed and I love the communal tables. The food is always great here (I love their wraps and lentil soup) and the service is always great. Their chickpea salad is amazing too."}
{"text":"This is a great place for casual or group dining.  It's a quick casual setting and service is friendly and fast."}
{"text":"I visited Souk Tabule for the first time last weekend. We went in the early afternoon when it was not so busy. Therefore the serives was quite prompt...  We sampled the following dishes and I would recommend them all - see notes:  HUMMUS  - Chickpeas, tahini, lemon garlic (good for a starter but next time i'll go with the chef's sampler)  LENTIL SOUP  - Pureed red lentils, carrots, celery no cream or butter (one is enough to share between two people)  LEBANESE HALLUM - Seared hallum cheese, tomato, arugula, black olives drizzled in a pomegranate dressing (this was WAY better than is sounds)  BEIRUTI FALAFEL PLATE Baked or fried, served over mujaddara (rice and lentils) and topped with Arabic slaw (huge portion for the price - ask for extra tahini)  I'll be heading back to Souk Tabule very soon..."}
{"text":"One word: muhammara Their muhammara spread is delicious, so are other spreads and mains. Coffee is phenomenal and the sweets are great! Lovely decor and ambiance. I keep coming back to try new flavorful entrees."}
{"text":"Love the concept. Cafeteria style. So accessible and quick. Food was good but sad that the rice is not the same as their sister restaurant, Tabule. We had the lentil soup, the salmon kebabs over rice, and the chicken breast kebabs over rice. It was all yum!  Just wish it was the rice like Tabule!"}
{"text":"Pretty awesome joint!  A bit more casual than I'd expected but really good food, large portion sizes and reasonable prices.  This place takes pride in what they offer and did not disappoint on variety or taste.  It's on my \"return to\" list.  Keep up the great offering."}
{"text":"Love this chain. So great that they have a variety of  vegan/vegetarian/gluten-free items that are clearly labelled and more importantly actually taste awesome!  Had the falafels with rice -- good stuff. This location adds a delicious side of purple cabbage salad to the plate for some extra crunch. Also had the hummus -- never disappoints.   I've also ordered the lentil soup before at this location which is delicious as well."}
{"text":"food is excellent, maybe even better than their original location, which would be a feat in itself.  service is friendly, but slow and a bit clumsy. probably growing pains. will try again."}
{"text":"Great spot for a casual dinner. Order your meal at the front, pay, take a number, and pick a seat. The staff are super friendly and will deliver the food to your table. The interior is clean and open with cute decor. There is also a self-serve water station which was really nice. I got the kefta meatballs; comes with about 5 on a bed of rice + coleslaw. The tomato sauce is very flavorful and the rice is nicely seasoned. Coleslaw gives a freshness to the dish! Good portion size too, for a very reasonable price.   Gem of the Canary District. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"There are some places that just scream out 'instagram me'.  I feel like Souk Tabule managed to grab that vibe while still keeping it low key and not be some stuffy over priced 3 hour meal.  It really helps that they created the whole atmosphere to be lit with tons of sun (2 story of windows!),  lots of warmth from the wood, and uses of beautiful blues whether it be the mural in the back or the robin egg blue on tables and wainscot.  I would say this is a fast casual spot where you order upfront at the cashier and then take back a number to your table so the food can arrive when ready.  Service here is friendly as the barista was telling me which espresso based drink was amazing.  Their coffee menu should be tried... it has their unique twist on some classics that just give it a boost of the ordinary (more on this later).  The menu had a lot different savoury options so if you're looking for your pancakes, you're not going to find it here.  Menu is pretty diverse and offers everything from a delicious looking platter of dips and meze to full big bowls filled with rice, dashes of vibrant raspberry pink coleslaw, and hunks of grilled meats.  For a late Sunday morning, I would say this place was pretty filled... there wasn't a table easily available for 2 or 4 but there are lots of big tables that you can use for a communal share.  Lentil Soup - I would normally say the idea of lentil soup shouldnt excite anyone but honestly, this is a very good soup.  It feels wholesome and like a warm hug with its creamy pureed red lentils and carrots.  Great thing that is has no cream or butter in it either.  It just has a vibrant savoury flavour with it's nice light use of spices. 4.5/5  Canary Salad - I think I saw an instagram picture of this and I think it's instagram pretty but the substance was a bit lighter on my plate.  It's supposed to have mixed greens, kale, and arugula... I think it was 95% romaine lettuce.  It was like a Mediterranean caesar salad.  It was mostly boring with it's one note citrus sauce that intermixed with tahini.  It did have 4 very large falafel.  They were ok... definitely more on the bland side but it was a much needed texture compared to the mound of romaine lettuce.  It did advertise to have hummus... it did but perhaps only a tiny bit on the bottom.  3.5/5  Soujuk and egg scramble - Perhaps these are very small chickens but the amount of 3 eggs seemed to be a lot smaller than I'm used to.  When I cook up eggs, it looks to be 2... ANYHOW, this wasn't bad but it was far from the perception we had for it.  It wasn't bad but for taste and amount, it just seemed to be less than expected.  It wasn't as flavourful or tasty as the lentil soup  3.5/5  Cinnamon and Honey Latte - So this was far better than I hoped... this was a delicious espresso based drink that almost feels indulgent.  The honey was a nice balance to rich coffee flavour and the cinnamon just gave it the right kick to make this quite memorable.  It was the favourite.  4.5/5  Maple Matcha Latte - This is my 2nd maple matcha i've had in the GTA (the other being Tsujiri) and this one has less matcha which makes it more palatable but I felt there was a lot of maple syrup being used.  It almost made it too imbalanced towards the sweet.  I like the flavour combination in theory but I'm starting to realize its a fickle one to do in reality.  I still like this one but the Cinnamon Honey Latte is my fave. 3.5/5  Overall, instagram pretty is what I'd call this place... all the food looks great on pictures but I think you'd need to choose wisely to get one that tastes as good as it looks.  For now, the lentil soup and cinnamon & honey latte are the ones to keep on my list."}
{"text":"My favorite middle eastern spot in the city. Saj pita made on site and always hot and fresh when its dropped on your table. Falafel os my favorite menu item. Other items that I hsve tried (and loved) are the Batata Harra,  the Babaganouj, and the Shashuka. Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"4.5! Food here was great and the service equally so. I went with three of my friends and we ordered the Chef's sampler, phoenician fries, honey labni saj, and the shakshouka. We were definitely stuffed at the end of our meal. The Chef's sampler is a must order and I highly recommend getting extra pita/saj. The three pieces that come with the platter were not enough! Our shakshouka came later than our other dishes and without us even asking the server came to apologize and comped us a free dessert. The halva saj that was equally delicious with the honey labni one.   It's a very opened space and gets busy around brunch time. If you are going with a large group, try and go around 11 or afternoon to avoid lines."}
{"text":"Very good, totally random yelp choice but ended up being good and delicious. I had this like mix sampler with pita and these fries and it was good for 2 medium hungry adults! Food was fresh and fast and the decor was cool very hip, belive its Lebanese"}
{"text":"Souk Tabule is one of our neighborhood spot. Staffs are incredibly knowledgeable. White reliefs with golden accents on the wall, rustic wooden tables, blue walls, marble tiles - Souk Tabule`s decor is an exquisite work of art.   I have visited Souk Tabule multiple times, hence this extremely long review. Below are dishes we have tried over the course of several months. The food is relatively consistent with a few hits and misses. My go to are the chef`s sampler and falafel. At the risk of boring you, below is the list of items we have tried.   Appetizers:  Chef's Sampler ($16) consists of Babaganouj, labni, muhamara, beet mutable, quinoa tabule, and arabic slaw! All wonderful! My favourite is the beet mutable -  Beets, tahini, lemon, garlic! Yum! Bonus points of fresh gluten free saj (flat bread) that does not taste like gluten free bread.   Saj with Za'atar ($4.50) consists of Dried thyme, oregano, sumac, sesame seeds, and olive oil. You can't go wrong with crispy herbaceous saj!  Mains: Beirut Pulled Chicken ($13.00) consists of slow-roasted turmeric pulled chicken, served over dirty rice with ground beef, and cinnamon, and topped with Arabic slaw. Overall the dish is on the slightly on the drier end.   Beiruti falafel ($7.00) in a saj pita, stuffed with Arabic slaw, tomato concasse, pickled turnip and tahini. Comes with three falafel. The falafel seems smaller than before for some odd reason. Regardless, I usually asked to the wrap to be open or without the wrap. I find it a lot more enjoyable! It is a great salad hack at Souk.   Shashuka ($12) with roasted tomato and red pepper sauce with three local free run omega 3 soft-cooked eggs and a scoop of labni. The dish is great for a morning brunch. Perfect for sharing.    Shish Tawuk ($13.00) with Ontario farm fresh chicken breast, grilled and served over turmeric rice and topped with Arabic slaw. Again, the chicken is dried and the portion of chicken is on the smaller end.   Sides: Phoenician fries ($5.50) with za'atar and drizzled in tahini. Dry seems to be the theme of some of the item on the miss list. Save the calories for something more delicious!  Mujaddara ($4.50) rice with lentil. Again, slightly dried.   Vegan lentil soup ($5.50) with pureed red lentils, carrots, celery no cream or butter. Nothing to write home about.  Desserts: Coconut cookies ($2.50) made with egg white and shredded coconut. A little too sweet for my liking!   Drinks: Avoid juices ($5.5) at all cost. Ever since they switched vendor, juices resembles toilet water.   Moroccan Mint ($2.95) comes in a decorative tea pot and miniature tea cups. Great for sharing!  Honey Cardamon Latte ($4.75) is a hug in a cap. Warm creamy latte with honey and cardamon goodness. This latte is a crowd pleaser!   Overall, Souk is a good option if you are in the neighborhood! Food is always fresh. Pita is made to order. Remember, for a good time, avoid their juices! Go for a nice scroll by the Make Peace exhibit after brunch, lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Have so many good things to say about this place!  Food - soooo good! The chef's sampler is a must. Comes with a couple of dips and warm pita. Not sure what all the dips were but they were all so yummy. Their pita is made in house and is soft, thin, and chewy. The saj pita with labni and honey is also really good. The warm honey was oozing out of the pita.. mmmm...  Service- this is kind of a fast casual place where you find your own seats and pay at the counter, but apart from that, felt more like a sit down restaurant. One of our dishes (shashuka) came out a bit late and none of us complained or really even noticed (was too into devouring the rest of the food), but they offered us dessert (saj pita with halva) on the house!   Four of us ordered 2 mains (chefs plate, shashuka) 2 sides (fries and saj pita) 2 drinks and got a complimentary saj pita and the bill came out to be under 60. Super good value for what you get. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Food and drink: Excellent! Their falafels are the best in the city - a good crunch on the outside and perfectly seasoned. The muhamara (red pepper and walnut dip) is also fantastic and so unique - an explosion of flavour! I highly recommend both! The portion sizes of the apps / sides may appear small at first, but are deceivingly filling. They have a variety of drinks (including wine in a can - what an innovation). I tried their spicy coffee - it was a bit heavy on the spice (actual chilli flakes in the drink) so I would opt for something more traditional next time.  Service and atmosphere: I love the bright, airy space and the modern decor - very instagram worthy. The service is friendly but more fast casual (order at the counter, and then they bring the food to you). I was mesmerized watching one of the chefs expertly make the saj bread - I don't know how they get it so thin just by hand tossing and they puff perfectly every time!"}
{"text":"Food was incredible. You could tell it was cooked by an experienced chef. Also, that the chef used premium ingredients to make the dishes we had. We ordered one of each off of the mezza menu. Including, shakshuka and coffee with mint black tea. Preparing to have an average Arab style breakfast, we were pleasantly suprised by the quality and detail put into each and every dish. From the creamy labne to the amazing Arabic coffee, it was all fantastic. To top it all off, was the amazing Saj bread. Literally made on the spot.   Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the service was incredibly slow, I didn't like having to pay before I ate, and it seemed our waitress had a little attitude. Even with that however, we loved the experience. This Middle Eastern restaurant is top notch!"}
{"text":"The place has a beautiful interior and some well seasoned and unique foods. Highly recommend the fried falafel balls with hummus or baba ghanoush. The pulled chicken wrap was good but the chicken was quite dry and needs some work. The cod sandwich was overall quite good but quite messy to eat.  I'll be sure to visit again and try a few more dishes. Definitely worth checking out if you're in the canary district."}
{"text":"Very good Mediterranean food. We ordered falafel, beef shawarma and shashuka. Was delicious. Kids friendly."}
{"text":"My first visit was really great. Food was really good and tasty. We were very happy with our lunch. We took the beef on rice, hummus and falafel. But went back there and tried their quinoa tabule salad and I was really disappointed with what they served me. It was 85% parsley, as you can see on the picture we can barely see the quinoa. So why call it quinoa tabule salad? They should name it parsley salad. And 6.5$ just for parsley I was quite angry"}
