{"text":"Based on a lunch visit this week, I am not sure I would describe the food as Latin American. I had a fried chicken sandwich, which was dressed up with chipotle mayo and accompanied by excellent homemade fries. Service was very good. The decor is attractive -- high ceiling, lots of light. I'll gladly return."}
{"text":"Being Latin American myself I can tell you with all honesty the food is catered to an upper class bourgeois Westmount Caucasian audience who assume, the more money they charge you, the fancier the food, the smaller the portions, the more rude the management can be.

We started off with a classic Pisco Sour drink that had no flavour of Pisco at all. Pisco is a Peruvian and Chilean drink with a rich perfume, which was completely absent in my glass. It was decent at best, not bad enough to send back, but not good enough to order again.

The 2 ceviches that are listed on the menu are not supposed to be filling enough to be a main course, but the waiter informed me that a third ceviche, unlisted would be enough to fill me up. \"It's a hearty meal\" we're his exact words. That too was disappointing as I could have easily ordered much more food after that. It was also DROWNING in far too much lime juice, and not enough fish / sea food.

The service was fine, and the deserts delicious, but that's not why I came for dinner. I came to eat and was still quite hungry by the time we moved on to coffee. I chocked it up to partly my fault for ordering something that was not listed in the main course, and let it go.

On the way home, my brother received a phone call from the staff, that THEY under billed us by $50, and we should come back and fix the waiter's mistake. They admitted the waiter made the mistake, but insisted we return immediately, or the waiter would have it deducted from his pay check. My brother continued the discussion until they decided to hang up the phone on him in mid conversation. At that point, I can honestly tell you, that is one of the worst and tackiest business practices you could ever adopt. Not only would I never go back now, but neither should you."}
{"text":"Amazing meal, great cocktails. Great deserts! Had the mest grill with some friends,  highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Super delicious!! We ordered a few salads (kale salad and watermelon salad --both to die for), and the giant steak. This steak was the best steak I've had in my entire life. Each bite melted in my mouth. So good...."}
{"text":"Brought some friends before xmas looking for something different.  Food was amazing, drinks were crafted with a nice mixology twist, service was great"}
{"text":"Good but too expensive.
I went with 3 friends for dinner. The place was busy, nice design and nice vibe. The general feeling at our table after the meal was that the food was good, not awesome, but too expensive. Dishes are on the small side.

The chayotte and jicama salad was refreshing and delicate, and so was the beets salad. My main dish of short ribs however was disappointing. For $22 I got a few small grilled short ribs with small pieces of meat, served naked in the dish. A few small servings of salads were served on the side. The meat was tasty but was too scarce, and the sauces served in the side didn't succeed in saving the dish. 

Most dishes were small considering the expensive prices they charge. We will not go back."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with the small portion sizes of the plates. The tiny empanadas were bland and lacking flavour. The fried yuca was the best as it was fried to perfection. The ceviche starter contained what seemed like 4 miniature size pieces. I was expecting a better experience especially for the price."}
{"text":"I write this review with mixed feelings because it was an extremely bipolar experience. 

Food: A
Service: F

I'll start with the food. The food was excellent. Very well executed simple dishes, yet with complex flavours.
Appetizers: empanadas, duck pupusas and 2 green salads. 
Mains: octopus, squid and strip loin. 
The only \"complaint\" I have regarding the food was some of portion sizes. The octopus was one small tentacle on a bean salad. It looked a little ridiculous on the plate. One of the green salads was about double the size of the other one with half the dressing. The squid was cooked to perfection with just enough seasoning and acidity. 

The service on the other hand was horrendous. Once we were seated at 6:30, we were immediately served water and given the menus. After 30 minutes of trying to wave down the waiter who impressively managed to not look our way even once, we got up and intercepted him as he was leaving another table. At this point, the restaurant was about half full with 10 occupied tables and 3 servers. Our waiter did not tell us what the specials were and when we asked what the catch of the day was, he responded by saying \"tuna\" while pointing at the chalkboard. When my mother ordered the spicy chorizo he replied \"you know that's a pizza\" in a very condescending tone. The appetizers were brought out one at a time with 5 minutes between each dish. When we realized the 2nd salad was not going to make an appearance we asked the waiter who responded \"you didn't order 2\". All 4 of us said \"yes, we did\". After staring at us for a few seconds he responded \"so would you like a 2nd salad?\". At the same time, we asked for bread, to which he replied \"you have to pay for the bread. Do you still want to order it?\". The main dishes were served soon afterwards and we happily ate the delicious food. We were not aware that none of the main dishes came with any sides as the waiter did not explain this nor make the suggestion at time of order. But at this point, it was obvious that our waiter was not coming back to our table anytime soon so we decided not to order any. Not once did he check in or ask how our food was. He completely ignored our table. After we were done eating, another server came to clear our table and proceeded to drop some dirty cutlery on my boyfriend. Didn't offer him a napkin to clean his clothes off, just hastily said \"sorry\" under her breath and walked away. At this point, it is now about 8:00. 10 minutes later, I managed to get another server to get us a dessert menu as our waiter continues to ignore us. By 8:40, when it was clear that our dessert and coffee orders were not wanted, we actually had to get up and intercept the waiter again so we could get our bill. My father very generously left a 15% tip and that was received with an eye roll from our waiter. I hope the kitchen staff is part of the tip pool at the restaurant. I would like to add, it is impressive how well he managed to ignore our table considering the restaurant space is pretty small and his other tables were just steps away from ours. 

I would like to give this establishment a better rating especially since the food was so on point, but dropping a few hundred dollars on a meal comes with a certain set of expectations and they were definitely not met on this occasion."}
{"text":"While the ambiance is charming, the food here misfires on so many levels. The menu is not cohesive, and very few dishes actually compliment one another. Mains are much too heavy for lunch, and everything was salty. I felt like I was eating from a menu that was put together randomly with little thought to seasonality or balance within individual plates."}
{"text":"Un excellent repas chez Lavanderia du même propriétaire que Park Restaurant situé juste à côté. Superbe entrée (oignon et porc), savoureux plat (steak haché sur os) du menu du jour, et délicieux dessert (gâteau fromage). Ambiance agréable et éclairé, service impeccable et sympathique, à découvrir si ce n'est déjà fait... mais vérifiez votre limite de crédit au préalable ! Visité en juillet 2016."}
{"text":"I've had dinner at Lavanderia twice, both times with some friends so we have covered most of the menu and had a chance to try a number of things on both visits. Our first experience was very positive, we had a great time, had very good service and enjoyed the food. So much so we made a point to go back again soon. Our second experience was a real let down and did not live up to our expectations. Now, our expectations where pretty high as 1- we had been there before  and enjoyed ourselves and 2- this place is pretty expensive. Most of the dishes are on the small side so it is best to eat tapas style ordering a selection of items for the table to share. Our favorites would include the Squid, arroz negro and the Octopus. 

As I said above we really enjoyed the food on our first visit, however the second time we ate there we found that the food was not nearly as tasty, even though we ordered some of the same dishes. I'm not sure what was happening but things were just off. What was even more off was the service on our second visit. For example getting some bread to our table required multiple requests and the manner in which our order arrived at the table was terrible. We were a group of 5 and were sharing a variety of dishes. The first two items to arrive at our table were the yuca chips and the potatoes, both starchy side dishes. I assumed that the rest of our order was following right behind. After five minutes passed and none of the other items that we ordered were in sight I asked our waitress what was happening and why only our side dishes had arrived. She told me that dishes come out of the kitchen whenever they may be ready and the rest of our meal should be along shortly. When I pointed out that I found it unusual that we would receive only our side dishes without any of the main courses and the the potatoes would be cold (they were in fact already cold at this point) by the time the rest of our meal would arrive she just repeated that things just come to the table based on when they are produced by the kitchen. Kind of a luck of the draw sort of thing. 

Well, this is one of the most absurd things that I have ever heard in a restaurant. A high end place like this should be able to time things a bit better. And if they make a mistake, as they clearly did in our case, I would expect them to recognize this and apologize. No such luck at Lavanderia."}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience. We were very excited to try Chef Antoine's new restaurant but it was a very unpleasant experience. A very very bad service..."}
{"text":"Un beau décor et belle ambiance relaxe. Un restaurant mélangeant les styles argentin et asiatique.

Le service était parfait, le serveur a pris le temps de nous suggérer des plats.
Nous étions 2 et nous avons choisi pour les grillades de poissons et viandes. Bonne cuisson des viandes qui étaient savoureuses tout comme le poisson
Excellent rapport qualité/prix, Les saveurs valent vraiment le détour, ca vaut la peine d'y aller à plusieurs reprises."}
{"text":"Excellent dinner for 5 to celebrate Magill graduation.  David took care of us, the chef made a special meal for one of our party with dietary restrictions.  The best!"}
{"text":"Started with the scallop ceviche @ $16, ended up being 1 scallop sliced razor thin with a few tomatoes,some onions and doused in coconut milk. Had a hard time finding the few pieces of scallops in all the milk. Tried the $100 mixed grill for 2. Received 1 burned sausage, half an over cooked steak, a small piece of corniche hen, a small portion of grilled calamari and a few vegetables. After seeing the beautiful spreads on Instagram this was a major disappointment. The one positive was our waitress was excellent and did everything she could to make up for a mediocre meal."}
{"text":"A wonderful meal from start to finish! I love to try as much as possible so my beau and I split all the dishes....except dessert. I started with a Caipirinha, which wasn't at all watered down and had a lot of lime (exactly how I like it). We started with the trio of Empanadas and the Loup De Mer Ceviche. Out of the two I preferred the ceviche because of the acidity and it was incredibly flavorful, with crunch added from the corn kernels. We then moved onto the Grilled Octopus and the Sweetbreads with Chorizo. The octopus was perfectly tender with a nice bit of char and a creamy mayonnaise sauce. The sweetbreads were also grilled and served on a bed of spaetzel-like small noodles with the chorizo and some green peas and beans. I had never had a grilled sweetbread before so it was a new experience....they were melt-in-your-mouth and surprisingly filling. For dessert my guy had the Alfajor, which I tried a small bite of, but I was engrossed in my Chocolate mouse with sweet bananas and chocolate sorbet. I am a chocoholic, and I thoroughly enjoyed the decadence and the restraint of having the bananas shine through the middle of the mousse. 
It's no surprise I enjoyed everything, I also love their sister restaurant....I will be back for sure, especially since terrasse season is here!"}
{"text":"It's a very different restaurant in terms of feel and decor. The food was excellent and the service was fine. I found the prices very high (and normally I don't mind paying for expensive meals - see my other reviews).  What irked me was being charged $8 for a Shirley temple for my daughter, and then being charged the same for a refill (that experience taught me a lesson...) We enjoyed our meal, just not sure they should be nickelling and diming for a soft drink.."}
{"text":"The food was good, I definitely recommend the restaurant. We went for a charity dinner and really had a great time."}
{"text":"I visited Lavanderia for dinner 3 weeks ago on a Thursday night with 2 friends. We hit it off with our waiter David, who treated us to excellent service all night.

We were celebrating my friend's bday so we decided to splurge a little... We split a bunch of appetizers, a main and some desserts. And the drinks kept coming ;)

I tried some of the ceviche + the homemade bread option (so delicious!) + the trio of empanadas. Everything tasted great. As a main, we split the short ribs and some yuca fries. The yuca fries were a little too starchy in texture but I enjoyed it with the chimichuri sauce that we asked for. The short ribs were yummy but too fatty for my liking. The flavour was great though. I really liked the South American inspired drinks, with caipirinhas and pisco sours on the menu.

The desserts were beautifully presented and tasted good. At around $80-100 per person (depending on how many drinks you order), it's very pricey and a nice treat on a rare occasion. Will be going back to try sister restaurant Park next, which is a few doors down. Also want to try Cafe Bazin!"}
{"text":"With all the hype of Chef Antonio Park and the impressive success of Park, we had our eyes set on Lavandria for an amazing experience. Walking into the restaurant, I was really impressed by the warm and inviting decor. Lavanderia seems to present more of a casual dining experience, compared to Park. We were immediately greeted, which set the tone for the night. The staff were very knowledgeable and attentive throughout the meal. 

We ordered both ceviches (shrimp and the fish of the day), the soup of the day (lobster, mussels, and shrimp), and the cornish hen. Without a doubt, the hen was the best. It was moist, flavorful, and perfectly charred. Although all the seafood was cooked perfectly, the shrimp ceviche was quite bland and the fish of the day ceviche was far beyond the point of proper acidity. The soup of the day was tasty but it came out lukewarm at best. 

Overall, given the reputation of the restaurant, our experience at Lavanderia was underwhelming. The meat was clearly the highlight, so we'll have to come back again and have a \"meat-lovers\" meal. Stay tuned for an update."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with friends on a Sunday morning. The place was pretty packed! Good thing we had a reservation! 
The restaurant is very bright and airy, the décor is cute and homey. You almost feel like you're at (a very well decorated) home here. 
I ordered the pupusa de pato and a mimosa and it was lovely! The food tasted great and the mimosa was very well balanced. 
The main complaint I guess is that I kind of wish there was more of it - maybe a little more duck on the plate too. 
It is a little pricier than a typical brunch place, but you also don't get this kind of food at your typical Cora or eggspectations. 
There were also some high chairs available for toddlers - not for infants though - which was unfortunate. 
All in all a very enjoyable meal with a lovely staff and environment."}
{"text":"Disappointing food.  Ordered the mixed grill. The food came lukewarm. The grill was warm to the touch but hardly hot and clearly just for show. Chorizo showed the potential for this place.  Wine recommendation was good and service was attentive.  Service saves this place from a poorer rating, but my experience could hardly be called adequate,  particularly considering the price tag.  I will not be returning.  Expected better from Chef Park."}
{"text":"Great decor, awesome menu items and food, very creative. I had to knock off two stars however due to how pricey it is and how hungry it leaves you."}
{"text":"Chef Park has done it again but this time offering delicious Latin American cuisine. My favourite brunch in Montreal."}
{"text":"Just not all it's cracked up to be.  Sorry. As other reviewers have already mentioned, this place doesn't really know what it's trying to be- except a moneygrabbing dining experience.  Tried it.  Wanted to like it.  Was completely underwhelmed.  

The drinks are ok- some served in questionable vessels (reminiscent of my grandmother's shrimp cocktail \"cups\"), a green salad on the menu... was worse than anything I can make at home, the short ribs served on that fake BBQ (WHAT is the point of that big, unwieldy contraption???) are tough.... short ribs are a cut meat for long cooking.... not a quick fry on the grilll, and dessert.... oh, dessert.  Props for the alfajore- but the rest.  Yeah....

Do not recommend at all.  There are so many other places, that are less expensive and serve better, unpretentious food."}
{"text":"I went for brunch and had the Kobe beef burger with a mimosa. It was the most expensive burger I've ever had but so worth it!!  It's not on the regular brunch menu. It was one of the specials written in the board. it came wit a corn on the cob. I'd want to go back and try their dinner menu."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner to celebrate a friend's birthday. I have to say that I'm a little bit disappointed. I don't think the food tasted good enough to be worth the price. I ordered a meat soup with corn and coriander inside. But I think there was too much coriander for this soup. The flavour of coriander was too strong. Then as main dish, I had grilled calamari with Yuca frita. The cooked calamari still had the smell of seafood...But the Yuca frita tasted special and really good! To be honest, the Yuca frita was the only part that I enjoyed for that dinner.
The service is very goo though."}
{"text":"I am sorry to say that I really don't understand the good reviews. I did hear good things about the chef before coming to this restaurant. Here is a breakdown of my experience:

Service: excellent and very friendly.

Decor: beautiful.

Presentation of the food: great.

Appetizers: queso was good, homemade bread was great, empanadas were flat and uninspired, kale salad was tasty.

Main dish: the parrilla. That's where it all went downhill. It was, for lack of a nicer word, terrible. Meat was not properly butchered and very fatty. Chicken was dry and tasteless. The tiny salads and sauces that come with the parrilla are boring and actually, not very appetizing. There were 2 different kinds of sausage in our dish (one green, one white) Both my husband and I weren't able to eat for how bad they were. I am not exaggerating  when I say this dish was almost entirely inedible.  

Desert: chocolate and peanut cake was too dense and overly sweet, banana torte was actually just a pie shell with raw sliced banana and dulce de leche... Don't need to be a chef to figure that one out.

I am so sorry I was this harsh.  I try to keep my reviews neutral, but I don't think that the price here justifies the quality of the food they serve. (80$/person, no alcohol)"}
{"text":"Went to celebrate my wife's promotion.
Service was amazing the staff couldn't have been any nicer or more attentive!
The specialty Drink to start was good along with a classic Fernet with coke is a classic argentine way to begin a night.
The appetizers wee also definitely good fresh shrimp ceviche and empanadas with some delicious fried yuca(cassava) 
When it can to the main course, the parrillada for 2 had the usual main ingredients, steak, Cornish hen, home made chorizo ( 2 kinds) short rib, sea bream and grilled veggies.
Though all were fresh and flavourful, having had an Argentinian parrillada before in Latin America, it felt a bit underwhelming and played safe in comparison to the magical monstrosity that I came to expect With: grilled sweat breads, kidneys, blood sausage, intestines and all the other cuts of both beef and pork.
It may have been my own fault by not making it clear enough when I said go all out when asked if I had any adversity to anything being included. 
(I thought my question as to whether sweet breads would be included might have been enough)
Desert which we shared, the banana tart with dulce de leche ice cream was great though and if it's on the menu when you go, without a doubt order it!

The ambiance was great though and we will definitely return, I think being with a large group, especially to share a parrillada is the way to go as with argentine tradition of sharing a LOOOONG meal and many many bottles of wine.
All in all it was Very good, just not great or amazing but it definitely has the potential to be."}
{"text":"Small Argentinian restaurant on Victoria, right next to Celeb chef Antonio Park's other restaurant, Park. 
I simply loved the food and flavours. Went for lunch and had their set menu of the day. The salad was kale, queso fresco, cashews, and pickled onions. The main was a duck Pupusa with salsa verde. Honestly one of the best dishes I've ever had. The crispiness of the Pupusa and the soft tender duck inside, covered with the salsa verde, topped with guacamole was on point. To finish, had a taste of the lemon cheesecake and I think it tops my own cheesecake... 
Go enjoy. My next stop: Park."}
{"text":"Lavanderia was opened up by Chef Antonio Park (of its next-door neighbour Park). The ambiance and decor is every bit as good as its neighbours, but I personally preferred the food and overall experience at Park. 

We turned to the waitress for help ordering because the menu is pretty big and overwhelming. Ended up starting with a quinoa and beet salad and a duck appy to start. We ordered the grill assortment for the main--a selection of sausage, lamb, chicken, fish, and pork brought out on a grill. Overall the food was good but it didn't blow my socks off for the price like Park did."}
{"text":"I don't even know how to start this review honestly. If you're into amazing food, carefully thought out and perfectly balanced, with meaningful recipes and the freshest ingredients, that's where you go. 

I went during a Brazilian Gastronomy Week event so the owner came out to talk a bit about the restaurant. You can really tell he put a lot of thought into it, from the name to the decoration and of course, the food. 

We had a 6 course meal, the corn bread wth a special butter made from an amazonian seed and the shrimp dish were my absolute favorites."}
