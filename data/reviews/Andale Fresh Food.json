{"text":"Popped in for lunch.  It's clean.  The music is fun.  The service is well above average.  The carne asada is good.   They offer 5 different salsas.  I recommend checking the joint out."}
{"text":"We came to this restaurant after reading the wonderful reviews. My food was ok nothing wow. The major disappointment was the wait time... They literally had one waitress and one cook on duty!! Our drinks and food took forever!!"}
{"text":"Why were you closed today?. It's Tuesday and it's 4:30pm. I was looking forward to trying this place"}
{"text":"The food was delicious. We had a cheese enchiladas plate with beans & rice, carne asada sopes, & pupusas (cheese & revueltas) the place was very clean, you can tell the kitchen looks very clean and the restrooms are very clean. *friendly staff"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service.  The fruit salad drink thing was amazing.  Great to find a good bite for a decent price close to the airport and strip.  Much better than some \"fancy\" Mexican places you find in the tourist areas.  Don't be discouraged by the bars on the windows, try it and be happy!"}
{"text":"Some of the most delicious tacos and pupusas I've ever had. The birra meat is so moist and tender, your mouth will think that you're making sweet, sweet love to a taco (marinate on that one for a minute!).

The staff is super friendly and very sweet. You can tell they put a lot of love in their food, and it overflows into their very welcoming dispositions."}
{"text":"Great service,  Affordable, and delicious. 

Came here  for pupusas and was very pleased by the slightly spicy cortido (slaw) and awesome menagerie of salsas provided. 
Chicken tacos were very fresh, slightly smaller than you might be used to,  so order one more than you usually would, they are very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Taquitos are delicious!  Much better than Robertos and Don Tortaco. Perfect refried beans. Salvadoran chicken tamales are flavorful, moist and authentic."}
{"text":"Really delicious family spot with the best of Mexican and El Salvadorian food. The carne asada fries are always a hit, and who doesn't love a crunchy torta. Also getting to try a Mexican style and Salvadorian style tamale side by side is a treat.  

Closes early so don't wait until dinner time to think of it! Look for Stephanie at the counter she was very kind. Absolutely love supporting local family spots, and this is a gem. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Don't let the bars on the windows fool you; this place is amazing! Great service, fantastic food and authentic Mexican food. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Stopped in recently with a friend to have dinner after work. I was excited to try a family owned mom and pop type shop for some Mexican grub. I felt that it was just ok. I ended up getting the carne asada sopes which were a pretty good size. I ordered two and had my friend help me finish the second. You do get chips and salsa brought out to the table, but there is a charge for refills. WHO charges (especially a Mexican restaurant) for refills on chips and salsa???????? The soda drink that you order is brought out in a can, do there are no free refills on that either -- so don't come here thirsty!!! It was fun to try a new place, but I probably won't return."}
{"text":"Best authentic mexican food ever!!!!!!!! It's like home style cooking which nothing beats that!!! Had the carne asada plate and omg was the meat was amazing super soft and tender!! Beans and rice were great also gonna start bringing people here. Real review from a real mexican from El Paso Texas!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff,  Mexican and Salvadoran fast food.  Great prices. Perfect for lunch. 

Had the chicken taquitos dorados,  they are topped with shredded cabbage,  Mexican cheese (cotija),  pico de gallo salsa, crema mexicana (mexican sour cream).  I got sliced Avocado on top.  Good and crunchy."}
{"text":"Was looking for someplace new to try best home. Andale got great reviews & recently opened so we gave it a try. It is a hole in the wall hidden in the back of a shopping center. It was empty & there was no one there other than the owners kids keeping busy after school. The prices were very reasonable, cheap in fact. Good variety of choices of food. I tried a few different items. Fajita plate: had to ask for tortillas & all they had were street taco size tortillas. It was ok. Pork tamale: not bad. Pupusa: decent. Wife had a variety of street tacos & she said those were excellent. Very friendly waitress."}
{"text":"A great new family run restaurant.  The girl that served us was a real delight and the food was excellent. At 16$ for two people an excellent value as well. I absolutely recommend it for a quick lunch!"}
{"text":"WOW! I came in the other day for a quick lunch after work and I was pleasantly surprised. The staff is so friendly and the food is great. The price is unbeatable for their amazing quality of food! I must say this might be one the best restaurants on this side of town."}
{"text":"Ok, One reason I go here is for me wanting to eat other than steak for dinner sometimes Andale's food is a great place to always try something different that is always really good no matter what I chose. One of the best places to eat Spanish food is at this restaurant. It's definitely one of the best. This place I recommend to anyone who lives in Henderson NV to try out Andale's Restaurant which serves very good choices Of tasty foods From Mexico and El Salvador. The people there are really nice.  Just thinking about it makes me hungry. I for one , really like Spanish food. So this place gets 5 stars"}
{"text":"I have been to this place numerous times and most of the time it has been pretty good, as long as they stay consistent with the quality of ingredients, the food and plating they will thrive. This seems to be a family run restaurant and  the people there are friendly every time I go in."}
{"text":"This Little Place is a GEM. Wonderful, tasty home cooked food with amazing prices. Definitely a regular Customer."}
{"text":"Stephanie, the front of the house, is wonderful and warm! The food is flavorful, and like it came from mom's kitchen! The only thing that could make it better would be beer, and I hear it is coming!"}
{"text":"Have you ever thought of the perfect Mexican food paradise? Every time I come here I leave completely satisfied. Even as I park I get excited for what is to come. My hubby works up the street and I envy that he is able to come here for lunch on the regular. We usually get the carne asada fries,tacos, pupusas, or a torta but we are willing to try to rest of the menu and we know we won't be disappointed. It feels like every meal is made with the same homemade love and care as the last."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! It just opened less than 2 weeks ago and we've been there twice. The service is great and the food is delicious. They give fresh chips and salsa. The pupusas are only $1.95 and are great. The street tacos are $1.50 and are really delicious. The taquitos and burritos are also fantastic. The al pastor and the carne asada are both good. We went with a large group and everyone was very happy with the food and the service. Everything is homemade and fresh! Highly recommend! We will be back a lot!"}
{"text":"I was greeted by a sweet and informative young lady.  She walked me through the different options and made suggestions based upon what I liked

I went with the carne fries and 4 tacos (one for each type of meat).  Each one delicious!  

I also tried the fruit drinks and the mango w/ Apple was my favorite. 

This place is on my short list of off-strip places to eat.  

Eat here, you'll be happy you did!"}
{"text":"Andale is exactly what is claims to be, fresh food. Meaning you may have to wait a little longer than you would at Roberto's, but it will be worth every second. This place is a mom & pop, hole in the wall at its finest! You order rolled tacos, then you watch her roll your tacos. Same thing with the shrimp cocktail, I watched her cut up the veggies right in front of me. Everything I have tried from here has been above average, and I have NOT even dined in the place yet.
Last time I was there, they gave me chips and salsa even though I was waiting for a take out order. The girl working the front always warns me if the salsa is spicy or not. (which I appreciate because I love me some spice!) And they even offer a couple not so common dishes, such as bistec ranchero, and heuvos platanos fritos. (both of those I highly recommend btw) However, if you want to stick to basic tacos or enchiladas you can't go wrong there either. 
The location is hidden, and they are not open late. But if you can manage to find the place and don't mind funky hours, I promise you'll have a new favorite local taco shop."}
{"text":"I love to try different kinds of food so I decided to check it out for lunch.   The food was amazing.  It was freshly made and arrived at my table pretty quick.  I ordered the Pupusas Revuelta and with the sauce that came with it I couldn't stop eating it until it was gone.  It was pretty good size and very filling.  But my eyes were bigger then my stomach and I ordered the Salvadorian Tamales de Pollo.  It was so moist and full of flavor.   I will definitely be back again.  This is a definite must try if you're looking for something unique."}
{"text":"Not a soul in the place at lunchtime - but I had read raving Yelp reviews so I went in anyway. Big mistake. I asked the waitress what everyone loves and tried her recommendation. Well it was terrible dried out chicken.Couldn't chew it. When I politely took it back up to the counter, the owner/cook? tried to explain that they fry the chicken on the grill and that's how it's suppose to look. I have no idea what others are raving about."}
{"text":"Good food at a great price. Vegan and vegetarian friendly. Highly recommended if you patronize mom and pop businesses."}
{"text":"Pupusa's were tasty! Everything was delish.  Great find when u got that craving ! The server was super nice.  torta was juicy and the goat tacos were  said to be bombski.. I dont do the goat hahah"}
{"text":"\"Andale\" is what you yell at you tummy to speed up digestion, because you're going to want seconds, thirds and fourths. 

This brings me back to San Diego, which in my opinion is where the best Mexican food comes from outside of Mexico. Andale is a no frills kind of place, no decorations on the walls or crazy loud music; the main focus is the food. 

I finally made way in here for lunch, because the call of the taco is strong. I sat down was given free chips and salsa, which surprised me; normally smaller places like this don't off this satisfying starter. I ordered two carnitas (pork) and two carne asada street tacos, fully loaded. Which means, cilantro, onions, two types salsa, all on two corn tortillas. These were amazing, loaded with tender meat, tons flavor, and just enough spice. This is how street tacos are supposed to be, made with two tortillas for durable food holding and no cheese. If you go to a taco shop and they put cheese on street tacos, you may want to reconsider your dining option. 

I also ordered a green chili pork tamale, which was cooked perfect. This was a homemade masterpiece, freshly unwrapped and served up. The maze wasn't too dry and the meat inside melted in my mouth. Simply a beautiful plate of food.  

As I wrapped up my meal, I noticed that they have a \"happy hour\". It changes everyday, but for twelve bucks you get an all you can eat food option. The day I was here it was chicken mole tacos, which includes rice and beans. If I wasn't about to burst I may have ordered some to go.  

True taco lovers... you feast awaits you!"}
{"text":"If you want all the best toppings on nachos but instead on top of French fries... This is your place.  The salsa is fresh, tacos are perfect & the service is kind. This is MUST TRY place!"}
{"text":"Wonderful, friendly informative service with a big smile! Tacos, Huevos rancheros! 

So worth the trip. Stopping by on Sat. On way out of town to get the salad drink!!!"}
{"text":"This place is new, incredibly friendly and not to mention delicious!! I only got to try their sopes dish with carne adobada.. The green guacamole salsa is delish! Would recommend it if you're looking for something that'll \"hit the spot\" as far mexican food goes!! If I lived here, I'd come see them every day!"}
{"text":"Found myself in Henderson one Saturday afternoon before a flight home. Consulted my mobile Yelp! for suggestions on where to eat and Andale appeared with great reviews. This place is classic whole in the wall strip mall, which is a good sign if you like authentic food. Andale has both Mexican and Salvadoran sections on the menu. 

I arrived about 4:15 and was the only one in the joint the entire time. Service was fast and friendly, of course. I ordered the enchilada plate and a side order of cheese and bean pupusa. The pupusa was delicious. Enchiladas were also very good, but the chicken was just a bit dry. Very authentic meal. Once again Yelp! delivers with a great recommendation!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food and quick and friendly service. Be sure to get pupusas revueltas (pork, beans, and cheese inside a tortilla). Also, the fried yucca and chicaronnes are great. 

Super authentic food. I'll definitely be back!

(Only complaint: they close at 7. Such an odd closing time for dinner.)"}
{"text":"We've been here a couple of times now and have not been disappointed.  Their food is fresh and full of flavor.  We will be back for sure, we plan on being regulars"}
{"text":"I was looking to try some place new for lunch and found this place while browsing Yelp. Based on the other reviews I decided to give it a try.

I am so glad I did as the service and food was amazing. I was greeted by a very friendly employee and even though I was only ordering to-go she offered me a seat and some free chips and salsa while I waited for my order to be prepared. I ordered two pupusas (one cheese and one pork) and they were easily the best pupusas I have ever had.

They make all of their salsa in house and they were even nice enough to label the ones I received as either for my chips or my pupusas since they had different salsas for each.

I will be going back here soon as the whole menu looked pretty tasty, and luckily for me they are a five minute drive from my house."}
{"text":"Wow!! Best Mexican food around the area!! Really friendly staff!! Eveything is tender and really juicy!!
Love it:)!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great! We stopped in on the way to the airport and I'm so glad we did. The server was very friendly, helpful, and attentive. We tried the pork enchiladas, the tamales de elote (off the Salvadoran portion of the menu), and fried yucca with pork (also Salvadoran). Everything was delectable! My boyfriend often leaves the sides of beans and rice unfinished at Mexican restaurants but he polished off every bite this time because even the sides were so good! Much of the menu is naturally gluten-free too, so that was a bonus for me. We don't live in Las Vegas, but if we're ever back, I hope to return to Andale Fresh!"}
{"text":"Wow. Very happy that I found this place on yelp, and I will be getting food here on a regular for sure. 
Not trendy, not fake. This is real deal good food to enjoy when you need a Mexican/salvadorian fix. 
Pupusas were perfect, tacos perfect, sauces delicious. They deliver!! Ordered twice and both times on point."}
{"text":"Best best best pan relleno aside from my mothers and the pupusas are delish! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful authentic food! The salsas are amazing!! 
The server Stephanie was fantastic! Great service, very knowledgable & friendly! 
She made me & my twin boys feel so welcome!!
We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Looked up a place to stop on our road trip and found this place on yelp. Excellent food, excellent service, best meal we have had in the Las Vegas area in many many years. They seemed so happy to see us and the place is in the corner of a strip mall so it would be easy to miss; but this is a diamond that is worth finding. We will be back! You should definitely go here; it is not your normal place."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem.  I found this on Yelp and the reviews were pretty good so we decided to give it a try.

On Thursday they had from 12 to 3pm Happy Hour for food no alcohol is served here....

For $11.99 per person they had all you can eat Pork Mole or Beef with Potatoes with all the fixings of course to include chips and salsa.  Even though it was close to 4 when we arrived, they still offered this to us.  We did not take the all you can eat as we wanted to try other stuff from the menu.

Chips and salsa was brought to the table and it was good.  We ordered our food and while waiting for our food, the server brought us a sample of the Pork Mole and the Beef with Potatoes.  Both were pretty good, it was homemade and made with love and very traditional.  

We had tacos and Enchilada's.  The sauce is a sauce like you would find more in Northern Mexico.  Southern Mexico tends to make their sauces a little sweeter.  

The tacos were good as well as the enchilada's, however the chicken is a combination of moist and over cooked meaning it was really dry, but you did not get that in every bite.

Our server told us on Wednesday they will have Taco Happy Hour, which is all you can eat tacos.  She was not real sure on the price so it will be between $9 and $12, thats the window.

I recommend giving this place a try, everything we had was good, it was only the chicken I found to be a little dry, but otherwise I would go here again.  I like family owned mom and pop places and they do not sacrifice traditional cooking for the American Way.  This is what you will find in their native land whether is be Mexican or Salvadorian style food.  THIS I LIKE and is why I will go back."}
{"text":"Tried the Pupusas, fried plantain with beans and yucca. Everything was delicious. I'm from El Salvador and their food is very authentic. I also recommend the  carne asada tacos   Very glad to have found this gem."}
{"text":"Great little family owned business. Clean and friendly atmosphere. I am in town for business and I will make sure to stop by again before I leave."}
{"text":"The kids loved their burritos, and I loved the torta cubana. Lots of flavor and lots of meat.  The waitress was really nice and let us dine in, even though they were closing in 15 minutes. More than that, she didn't rush us and stopped by just to chat with us and the kids. I hope this place gets more business, as they're kind of hidden behind a vacant diner."}
{"text":"So they truly lived up to their name!  The place is clean and neat, the people are extremely nice and friendly.

We went in as a large group 10 people and they met all our needs and we had a good experience!"}
{"text":"Food is always made fresh and the workers are always helpful in explaining the food and making recommendations on the best items. I've been here twice now, the first time I got the burrito which was great and this time I'm getting the chicken enchiladas which already smell amazing. Can't wait to come back and try something new!"}
{"text":"Food and service was really good!! Chicken soup was the perfect meal for the rainy day."}
{"text":"I walked in at 650pm but they closed at 7pm. I asked can you make 15 Papusas to go is that ok or are you closed they told if you wanna wait about 20 min we can make them for you. I said ok I'll wait talk about great customer service they gave me chips and salsa while I waited this place is great the Papusas were fantastic the best I've had in Vegas probably definitely going back to this place Andale great food and great service it don't get any better. 

Great Work Guys"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in Henderson. Excellent tacos and papusas. They were delicious when I bought them fresh and they're delicious warmed up...obviously bought way too many!"}
{"text":"Yes!! A great Mexican food joint! I've tried a lot of their food and can't give one criticism. Very delicious and the quality is high. I can't stay away now. Their chips and salsa are also top notch. I particularly love the really hot salsa. The flavor of it is unlike anything I've ever tried and I'm hooked. Definitely recommend everyone to try them out!"}
