{"text":"BF finally introduced me to A Slice Above a few days ago.  I have 6 words: honeybee pizza on whole wheat crust.  And the bacon was whole strips, not tiny little crumbles.  The sweetness of the honey really complements the smoky saltiness of the bacon and I don't remember what kind of cheese it was, but it was GOOD.    Picked up a menu to take home for perusal and drooling later."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in a while. Quality ingredients from what my taste buds could tell. Ordered the bodybuilder as described and loved the crust (house crust), crispy and soft all at once. The spicy sauce was not overly spicy, infact a little sweet. However, that may have been the sweet peppers doing there job. The dynamic menu choices make this the only pizza in Cleveland I'll be experiencing for a while. If in doubt just try it, #fivestars"}
{"text":"You pay for what you get....what you get is some of the best pizza in town!  Twister is my favorite but can't go wrong with anything on their menu."}
{"text":"The best pizza! Love to try them all and my favorite is the Twister. Wonderful staff!"}
{"text":"Moving away from Strongsville always resurfaces as one of the great regrets of my life every time we drive down to visit A Slice Above.  Angelo's in Lakewood has nothing on 'em.  Seriously.  A Slice Above is clearly the superior pizza choice.  I especially adore their Twister pizza (soft pretzels with a cheddar cheesy sauce), although my best friend said it sort of tastes like mac 'n' cheese.  Another favorite of mine is the Rancher's Choice -- fresh spinach, garlic slices, broiled chicken, cheddar cheese, and topped with a \"tangy ranch salad dressing\" (but no mushrooms for me, please!) .  More recently, they came out with a pesto pizza that I've been dying to try.  It's not all gourmet, either, for you plain Janes out there.  They have \"normal\" pizza, too -- The Pepperoni Feast, the Vegetable Patch Pizza, and Pizza Margherita are just a few options.  You can also build your own.  They have 5 different crust choices -- New York Style, Chicago Style, \"Slice Above\" Style, Whole Wheat, and Low-Carb (with Chicago, Whole Wheat, and Low-Carb only available in medium sizes).  While you might be tempted to go with New York or Chicago Style crusts, I say stick with what's local and go for the \"Slice Above\" Style.  They have 5 different sauce choices -- Traditional, Marinara, Bianco, Spicy, or Sweet & Light.  The Bianco is my personal favorite.  You can probably sense A Slice Above is no stranger to variety, but their creativity doesn't stop with their pizzas.  They also offer Slice Overs (their version of a calzone, totally customizable for $.50 a topping), wings, Slice Cream (what other pizza place offers homemade ice cream?), and Take N Bakes.  Take N Bakes are awesome for people like me who don't live close by.  Their gourmet pizzas are still made fresh to order, but they're given to you unbaked -- all you have to do is take it home and stick it in the oven!  They even provide a baking tray.  Fabulous!"}
{"text":"This is my first time ordering from A Slice Above and I am glad that I did!  First of all, I used their online ordering. I really liked the layout of the website. It was easy to navigate and order exactly what I wanted. I really prefer this way of ordering, so that is a plus for me. As most places with online ordering, they also gave the option to put it a delayed order.   My pizza was done on time and as expected. We got a pizza with the whole wheat crust and a low carb crust. Both exceeded expectations! For being a 'healthier' version of a crust, they were both really good, and I don't think you'll miss the regular crust. If you are following a low carb, Atkins, Keto, etc. diet this pizza is going to become a go-to choice for you.  The staff was also really friendly while I was in the store, the store was clean, and definitely a ship-shape restaurant.  I can't wait to try it again!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 3 stars only because of the Twister pizza. A pizza with pretzels on it is a great idea and they did it just right. Aside from that the other pizzas are not good at all. The cheese was burned and there was not enough sauce. I would go back for the twister alone but I would skip their traditional pizza."}
{"text":"This pizza is amazing, great taste in both quality and in unique names for pizza.   They do offer a variety of different crusts option, including my favorite \"Chicago Style\".   Any place that has a Soft Pretzel pizza is okay in my book."}
{"text":"If you're buying standard pizzas with standard toppings this is a good, not great pizza place.  Their regular pizzas are pretty good.  Now, where it shines, and earns 5 stars is in the specialty pizzas and crust options.  First off, the crust options are phenomenal.  If you're dieting or just eating healthier they have a low carb crust that only has 5 grams of carbohydrate/slice, which means you can eat as much as you want without guilt.  They also feature a whole wheat crust, which is obviously much better than eating a pizza crust made with white flour.  Even if the pizza was mediocre (which it is not), this would be enough to keep me coming back.  Next, the specialty pizza options are phenomenal.  The pesto pizza is one of the most delicious things I've had to eat at a pizza place.  The pesto doesn't overwhelm the other flavors, which you would expect to be a risk with this kind of thing.  The twister pizza is also excellent.  As a fan of soft pretzels, this is such a cool option to have available.  I also really like the nacho pizza.  You'd think that it would be tough to deliver a nacho experience on top of a pizza, but they really nail it.  If you just want regular pizza, this is a nice option and worth getting, but there are competitors in the area that are different, but equal.  Where this place really earns its stars is with the crust options and specialty pizzas.  GET INTO IT."}
{"text":"Got the Quatro Cheese Pizza. Disappointed. Not anything better than a $5 cheese from anywhere else. Ill go back one more time and try another specialty pizza but Im not getting my hopes up."}
{"text":"Hands down best pizza ever! Had the death by pepperoni, ahhhhh mmmmmm a zing!!! The guy on the phone even gave perfect directions, to two females none the less! This place needs to be on everyone's bucket list"}
{"text":"A truly great independent pizza place. Unique specialty pizzas (our favorite is the Jimmy Hoffa with added jalapenos), expertly done, priced fairly, and delivered fast and hot. We found them about a year ago, and have never been less than completely satisfied (more often, we've been completely thrilled) with their food."}
{"text":"I have had many pizzas from here, and always love that they dont skimp on toppings, even on the personal pizza. BUT, today, Super Bowl Sunday of all days, I was just picking up a personal Pepperoni Feast. ( Timing  didnt matter, i figured a little bit longer than usual, no problem guys.) It is not a request off the menu, I just wanted this feazt, but on a Personal size. There was no description saying it had 12 pieces only of Pepperoni, but when you put FEAST in the description and saying its double the amount & the picture on the website just shows LOTS of yummy looking pepperoni.  I figured this would be that way...but no. How is 12 pieces DOUBLE then the regular pepperoni. The personal pizza always has 2 pieces pepperoni  on each slice, giving you 8. Well, 16 is double, not 12. (I called to tell them this didnt look like no Feast, no dripping pepperoni grease, and he said I should have 12 pieces) So thats my complaint. Its not that it sucked, but VERY disappointed in the topping dept...."}
{"text":"I feel mislead.  I just don't like it when a pizza place says it serves Chicago style pizza, and its just thick crust.  You should need to go to Chicago and order a pizza before you insult their city by calling this Chicago style.  The Italian sausage was cut into chunks, and looked like kielbasa, but tasted kinda like the box I took it home in.  Not that there was a ton of sauage or onion on it anyhow, but what I did get, didn't think it was that good.    I doubt that I'll go back anytime soon, but maybe the other crust aren't as bad, as I'd like to believe the other reviews.    I had plenty of leftovers of course, as no one wanted to eat it, and as I tried to eat a slice for breakfast, realized it actually could get worse, and it doesn't reheat good either.    Maybe if I sat at the bar next door for a couple hours and got drunk, this pizza would have seemed ok."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in the cleveland area. This is the worst review on yelp."}
{"text":"This place is in a strange area, keep it up slice above. I've ordered 7 times from here now and am still impressed. Advise to newbies try a pizza that you don't think you'll enjoy.... This place will really surprise you. If your getting some thing you've never tried go with a medium and share it with the other half or go solo and chow down. A must go to place for late night food."}
{"text":"I'm a tremendous fan of the low-carb crust although I have also enjoyed their other crust options. The sausage choice is a little weird for me, as I really love my pizza sausage to not be in a casing, but it doesn't deter me from ordering it every time I get a pizza. Quick service. Great guys working there. My work schedule makes their late hours even more appreciated. Thanks!"}
{"text":"The pizza \"restaurant\" is part of a biker bar oddly called \"The Office\". I was dragged there by friends and while the food was good I felt weedy after leaving at 2am and looking in their pizza perpetration area which was closed but food was left out uncovered, place was very dirty - from TE floor to food surfaces and their food makeline had products left inside - so obviously they are keeping products in there day after day! And kids left off too! Won't ever eat there again disgusting!!"}
{"text":"Finally! I have found a pizza place close by that I love. I've tried so many and my friend mentioned this place so I finally tried it. The first time my fella and I just got pepperoni pizza and garlic parm wings, both were good. It's cheesy, sauce is delicious and the crust is yummy too. The wings didn't have a strong flavor but were still good. We went back a week later and we got a small pizza margherita, a cheese and pep slice over (it's their version of a calzone) and mild wings. It all was even better than the first time we tried it. The tomatoes on the pizza were blended in just right without tasting gross like some do. The slice over was delicious, loved the sauce in it. The wings were tasty as well! I love this place and I think it's started a pizza addiction for me."}
{"text":"This is locally owned. Lots of varieties for sure. I felt the place was little over hyped to its taste. Atleast for the Veggie options. The deep-dish was a little overdone but tasted good. I'd give it another go."}
{"text":"Best pizza is death by pepperoni!"}
{"text":"We've been eating pizza from here for ten plus years and have never been disappointed. The menu is amazing with so many specialty pizzas but we usually order the same thing ....why mess with perfection! The pizza is always baked perfectly, the mild wings are meaty and the best around and the salads are always fresh and loaded with cheese and pepperoni. Great and friendly staff and the food is always ready on time. Try it !!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic! Service was wonderful & everything tasted amazing! The salads are delightful, the pizza margherita & vegetable patch were very good! Will order from here again often!"}
{"text":"We've lived in Strongsville for just over a year now and have been searching for our new favorite pizza delivery.  We found our new favorite with A slice above!  We tried the honey one and it was delicious.  We were pleasantly surprised by how good this pizza was!  I can't wait to try another specialty pizza from ASlice Above!"}
{"text":"Took the family out to try this place after reading the reviews. Wasn't as good as the reviews make out to be. We ordered 4 items: Bread sticks with cheese, the twister, the death by pepperoni, and the pepperoni feast. The breadsticks were good a nice thickness and chew ability with the dough (this is there pizza dough also). An ample amount of cheese melted and crisped slightly on top and served with a descent mild sauce. The \"Twister\" pizza was very interesting and surprisingly tasty. This pizza is made with a cheddar cheese sauce and topped with soft pretzel bites with Honey and then mozzarella and provolone. The next two pizzas that we had were the \"Death by Pepperoni\" and the \"Pepperoni Feast\" both pizza's looked very nice but were just way to greasy. the grease factor on the pizza's was off the charts. Grease running down our hands and arms as fast as we could wipe it off with paper towels. The boxes were actually soaked through and they do have corrugated liner squares under the pizzas. The grease was so overpowering (not in a pepperoni grease twangy way, but just in tasting an oily greasy flavor and texture) you could not taste any of the pizza sauce and dissecting the pizza's it looked as if they barely put any sauce on either of these in the first place. If we are in the area we may try it again but change what we order and stay away from all that grease."}
{"text":"Traveling thru the area. Was a nice place to order carryout and great different taste."}
{"text":"A Slice Above where have you been all my CLE life?   Ok, it's probably me, but how. did. I. Not. know. about. YOU!?  I ordered 2 pies (Medium) which came to approx. $24; this isn't bad because aside from the big box 'za places, this is comparable in price and for what you get, I think it is a pretty good deal.  Pie 1 - Pepperoni Feast - Slice Above Crust, regular sauce, added garlic slices.  Pie 2 - Pesto - Whole wheat crust.  They made an error with my order and instead of the pepperoni feast I got the Death By Pepperoni which essentially added bacon to my pie, plus more pepperoni and cheese.  I like bacon, so I didn't care.  The verdict: The 'za was fresh, delish, and well made.  They certainly didn't skimp on the toppings either.  The whole wheat crust was dense and slightly sweet, but not annoyingly so.  The regular crust was perfect, not too thick, not too thin.  Finally 'za worthy of my taste buds!  A few things that could be worked on: 1. The website.  It doesn't work for all the links 2. The website ordering - you can't add notes to your order.  (Ex. I wanted my 'za ready at a later time.  I couldn't include that info on online ordering so I had to call it in.) 3. The website - The menu isn't accurate (Ex. The Pepperoni Feast is not the 'za that is described.)  For those of you who know what Mellow Mushroom is, this might even be better, In My Opinion.   I like it, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way home (Lorain County). Ordered Death by Pepperoni and a white (Bianca) Pizza, along with a Slice Over (personal sized calzone). All were very good! The crust on the pizzas had a great doughy crunch to them. The Bianco Pizza was my favorite: just the right amount of garlic butter and cheeses. Wish this place wasn't 40 minutes away, but the next time I'm in the area, I will definitely order again! The employee that answered the phone was super helpful in suggesting Pizza and appetizers. Excellent customer service, as well upon pickup! :)"}
{"text":"Had some of their pizza at a party and enjoyed what I tasted. I'd say it's the best pizza I came across in Strongsville."}
{"text":"This place gas very good food.  Me and my family get this all the time and they have quick service and very good wings.  GO THERE!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a Chicago style vegetable patch with spicy sauce, waist watcher Chicago style, and a garden salad. The pizzas were so tasty, vegetables were fully cooked and flavorful which seems to be difficult for pizza places to achieve. Spicy sauce was decently spicy too (from people who enjoy the spice). Garden salad was okay, all iceberg but adding some pepper on top made it better. Good quality cheese. Chicago style is definitely Midwest style deep dish."}
{"text":"If you are stuck in Strongsville, at least there is one place with very good pizza.  They are very good with their Slice style or thin crust.  They have several types of sauce options,yes you have real choices here (Big Plus to Bianco-white and Sweet & light) Forget speciality pizza, we are well past that.  Quattro Formaggio - cheese and more cheese, Body Builder roasted red peppers and bison meat with spicy sauce. Then you can do clams, honey bee, ant Tutti Fruiti (I can not see mandrin oranges, pineapple and canadain bacon on pizza, but its there)  They have an achilles heel in Chicago style crust.  There is low carb too, but really why do this to pizza. Oh yeah, they run the bar next door, another reason to pickup possibly"}
{"text":"This is the  best pizza around,  And I can get it the way I like it. They have always been fun, and welcoming every time I have been in there.   the best Pizza around, and a wonderfu place. Thank you A Slice Above Elaine"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza on the west side for sure! Not too greasy and delicious sauce! Try it and I promise you wont be let down."}
{"text":"Where's the Beef?, order this pizza it's the best.  It can get greasy so don't hold it on the ride home and don't put on your car seat!  We just tried the Tutti-Fruitti Pie-, we weren't fans of this one.  There standard single topping pizzas are great.  Would have giving 5 stars but to much grease."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in Strongsville.  Lots of specialty offerings, fair price for product received.  I recommend anyone looking to buy a pizza in the area not hesitate to give this shop a try.  I put this pizza only very slightly below my personal local favorite Angelo's of Lakewood."}
{"text":"Best pizza in strongsville area hands down. Lots of options to choose from including types of crusts, and all the toppings on the planet. I always do delivery and they beat their time estimate every time, which I appreciate with hungry dudes in the house. Aiming to collect coupons from their boxes to get a free pie one day. Big fan!!!"}
{"text":"I've lived in Strongsville for 25 years and always avoided ordering from Slice Above due to the rough looking exterior. Biggest mistake of my life. Do not judge a book by its cover, folks. I've been eating Slice Above for four years now and have turned countless friends and family members into addicts. None of us can get enough. My boyfriend and I order it so often that I have enough \"Pizza Points\" for about ten free pizzas. We don't even look at other options anymore.   The pizza is unique, fresh and absolutely delicious. The Jimmy Hoffa is our favorite, the fresh full sized bacon is delicious. It's even good cold or reheated. The HoneyBee is surprisingly tasty as well; Who knew honey instead of sauce would make for such a good pie?! I'm not normally a veggie pizza girl, but the variety they put on theirs makes it absolutely amazing. Give Slice Above a try, order a side of garlic butter sauce and some teriyaki wings, and never look back."}
{"text":"We love the Honey Bee pizza here, plus the margherita pizza. We lived in town almost 20 years ago, but we still stop by for the honey bee when we're in the area. Yum!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in Strongsville.  Regular customer for over 20 years and the quality never wavers.  Recently tried the wings and they are great too.  I order on-line before leaving work and it's waiting for me when I get to Strongsville.  So easy-peasy."}
{"text":"Great pizza and breadsticks; took no time at all to get the order; staff was very nice and attentive. Definitely would recommend this establishment for any pizza lover."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place around. They always have new and interesting things to try. They make combinations that you wouldn't think to put on a pizza. My absolute favorite is the twister pizza."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the Strongsville area! They're pizza is delicious and  the amount of toppings you could order is insane! We ordered two pizzas, Chicago style and Slice Above style. Chicago style had just the right proportion of cheese and tomato sauce. The only thing is the price. When I ordered, they never told us how much each topping was, so the total was around $65 (my family likes lots of veggies on their pizza)! That was just a little too much for two pizzas. Their pizza quality compares to Angelo's in Lakewood. I would prefer Angelo's (price wise and proximity wise), but my family thinks otherwise. The staff wasn't rude, but they also weren't that nice. Overall, great pizza, above average price."}
{"text":"We got a large pepperoni and mushroom pizza with spicy sauce. It was really good  The spicy sauce definitely has a kick to it so don't order it if you don't like spicy   I also got a garden salad, which I thought would be small but it was a big salad.   Will order again!"}
{"text":"Ordered a few drinks at the Office and decided to order a salad and pizza.... it was amazing!  The salad was large and the lettuce and vegetables were fresh.  The pizza was seriously amazing!  We ordered original crust, spicy sauce, pep, sausage and banana peppers..... soooo good!!!  We love this bar/pizza joint"}
{"text":"Great pizza. It has replaced Angelo's as my Cleveland favorite. Try the Chicago Style with pepperoni and sweet red sauce. Oh, sweet love!  (Please note. It's not true 'Chicago style pizza'. There isn't a place in Cleveland that truly gets that right)"}
{"text":"The New York style isn't New York and the Chicago style isn't Chicago... Average pizza nothing great!"}
{"text":"Im staying at the Holiday inn Strongsville and was referred a slice above by the front desk. The prices are so cheap, I got a death by pepperoni pizza with a Pizza over the slice and a Pepsi with delivery all for less than $20 and it's the best pizza I've ever had anywhere I'm a pizza, Stewart I've had pizza all over the country and it's the best you definitely should go five stars!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza. Period. The Jimmy Hoffa is our favorite. It starts with an amazing crust with spectacular, authentic yeast flavor, topped with delicious bacon and other toppings. There is no shortage of good pizza in Cleveland, but A Slice Above is a local standout."}
{"text":"The best pizza I ever ate, hands down. If only they would deliver to Lakewood *sigh*  You can't go wrong here. Whether more traditional or an off the wall original you'll be so happy you ordered A Slice Above. My personal favorite is the Twister or Vegetable Patch. Don't let the unassuming strip mall fool you, this is pizza royalty."}
{"text":"I don't know why there are animals around. I once went into the store at approximately 1:45 a.m and as soon as I set foot in the store a little angry  ran at me yipping  viciously. I quickly backed out of the store and closed the door. A weird guy scraggly thin guy came from the back of the store and in a very angry and and rude manner told me ( through the glass) the store was closed. The expression on his face and manner he spoke to me were as if I had asked him to use the macaroni from his kids father's day card as a pizza topping. Haven't been back there since."}
{"text":"The Bacon Cheeseburger pizza is amazing!!! Actually, everything we've tried from A Slice Above has been awesome.  We ordered online and it worked out perfectly."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a pizza shop with low carb pizza crust for a long time. I searched on Yelp and was lucky to find this place. The pizza was amazing and I'm so excited that now I know where I can go when I need a pizza fix on my low carb diet!!"}
{"text":"been ordering from these guys for about 10 years. never a disappointment in food, and they have a cool mascot in their cat , Giuseppe, we actually have one of his offspring, by virtue of luck,and serindepty. but they treat you like theyre doing u a favor. pretty rude consistently. I'm a past partner in a pizza place and would never allow the attitude. it's one reason we don't order regularly. but guess it works for these guys."}
{"text":"This place has excellent pizza and for about two years we have ordered pizza from only this place because everywhere else seems to be sub par. I highly recommend the Motherload, which is just as awesome as it sounds!   You can't dine in at this place, it is a delivery joint but next door is The Office, a cozy hole-in-the-wall pub for the locals. You can stop in for a pint and they serve A Slice Above pizza right there. They are two different venues that share a kitchen."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza. Choices of sauce, crust and ingredients. We like the sweet sauce and pepperoni and roasted red peppers. We have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Awful! I got a pizza and a salad and it was such a disappointment. Burnt pizza!"}
{"text":"Fantastic, deep-dish pizza. Personal pizzas are also available on the cheap (i.e., $5). Lots of unique varieties, such as cheeseburger, which has a mustard and ketchup base (sounds disgusting, but it's actually quite good); and honey-bee, which has a honey base, comes topped with ham and mozzarella cheese, and makes for a sweet pizza!  Has a cat that lives outside and a TV for employees during working hours. Lots of Superman paraphernalia and other, homey items. Seems like a great place to work!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the Cleveland area I've ever had. Would definitely recommend giving the Bacon Cheeseburger Pizza a try, sounds odd but it's amazing.  I've never actually eaten there, only gotten takeout so I can't speak for the inside of the place itself."}
{"text":"The spicy sauce made the meal worth it. So many places are focusing on the \"special\" pizzas while overlooking the traditional. I enjoy a pepperoni and extra cheese pizza, nothing special. This hit the mark."}
{"text":"Tried the cheese sticks and twister pizza.  Cheese sticks were tasty and had a mild garlic flavored. They also came with a side of sauce.  Twisted was really unique with nacho cheese and a soft pretzel cut on top. It needed more nacho cheese or a side of it because it was a bit dry.  Place is in a little strip mall pretty far north on pearl."}
{"text":"Very tasty pizza. I ordered the Waist Watcher pizza. I highly recommend it for anyone counting calories. It scratched my pizza itch without blowing my diet. My husband ordered a pepperoni pizza and he said it was good. He'd like a little more flavor in the sauce. Next time he plans to order the spicy sauce. All in all it's good pizza with something for everyone in our house."}
{"text":"Delicious. Got the wheres the beef pizza. Amazing sauce. Excellent flavors. The crispy bacon strips on top. Yummm.  We found our new favorite pizza place."}
{"text":"First let me say that I live in Westlake and took the 30 minute drive to Strongsville to pick it up, that's how much of a fan I am of A Slice Above. I grew up in Strongsville and have heard from friends that this is THE SPOT for Pizza in Strongsville. Luckily when I started dating my girlfriend a year ago, she was living in an apartment down the street and I finally got to try it.   The restaurant is a small pizza shop on Pearl Road attached to the Office Bar (where I have never been before) and the parking lot is small and cramped as is the restaurants lobby. It seriously looks no different than any other small business shop but this place means business. There are so many different combinations but we like to stick to the normal or what I thought was normal. I traveled there last Friday night to pick up a medium \"Death by Pepperoni\" pizza, a dozen garlic wings & a 2 liter of coke. I was quoted a 30 minute wait for pick up and it was ready when I arrived. After making it home, it was literally pure bliss.   The pizza itself is wonderful. A great traditional sauce, a little more than normal cheese and lots of pepperoni and FULL slices of BACON make this pizza awesome in every bite. Did I mention the crispy and chewy crust?...Outstanding. The garlic wings are really the star of the show, my girlfriend swears that they are her absolute favorite wings. They are large, meaty and drenched in garlic butter. It's a fat kid's dream. Stop what you're doing now and get pizza and the wings from here. Probably my top 3 pizza places in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza. I am usually just a cheese pizza kind of gal but their sausage is so delicious I have to have it. Never disappoints."}
{"text":"Yes, yes!  I have been eating this pizza for years and feel bad I've waited so long to review it.  Highly recommend the South of the Border!  Tex-mex style, amazing crust, and reheats very well.  They have bizarre concoctions here, and each one I try leaves me happy I did.  The prices are a little steep compared to the discount chains.  You get what you pay for though."}
{"text":"My go to place for wings! Compared to Angelos in Lakewood. This place is the real deal. Better quality wings then BW3 down the street. They are also really quick with deliveries.  I love the garlic and mild!"}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza here and went to go pick it up and the pizza had hot banana peppers on it instead of green bell peppers. Told the guy I asked for bell peppers and he said \"oh, those ARE bell peppers\". A girl behind him had to let him know that bell peppers are the green ones. Had to wait there while they cooked a brand new one. What kind of pizza place employee doesn't know what a bell pepper is?  Then when they remade the pizza, they got the CHEESE wrong this time. Worst pizza experience ever"}
{"text":"I ordered some late night wings to pick up from there and most of the time they are amazing. Except the garlic flavor wings - the flavor is not blended into the chicken meat but only on top of the dry wings. Overall it's delicious and good for a late night craving."}
