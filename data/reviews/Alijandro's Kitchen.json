{"text":"Baklava crumble was a big hit with my family. The warm caramely nutty baklava paired with cold ice cream was delicious.  I was pretty intrigued with the fa waffle so ordered the avo chicken. It was ok. Could have been better if it wasn't so cold! It was that filling either for $10.  Will try other items on their menu the next time."}
{"text":"Alijandro's Kitchen was absolutely delicious. My husband and I split a fawaffle, I had the salad and rice bowl without chicken, and Omar had the chicken taboon tacos. We finished with Alijandro's fabulous take on baklava. As a vegetarian, it's rare to find a restaurant like Alijandro's that offers choices - all of which are satisfying, healthy and super tasty. Clean, delicious, interesting food with top-of-the-line service. I highly, highly recommend."}
{"text":"I got the chicken box, it's pretty good and the portion was decent, however the price was on the high side $13.50."}
{"text":"Randomly found this truck parked on King near Simcoe. Avo chicken fawaffle is to die for. Must try!!! And the owners very nice"}
{"text":"Middle eastern Mexican sounded pretty unique so I thought I'd try it out and it was much better than I expected. The flavours are done really well and I like all the healthy options. Really great to have a place like this in mississauga and I hope they do really well."}
{"text":"We were at the Canada Day festival at Celebration square and I was intrigued by the truck with fawaffles. Waffles made out of falafel. Since the entire family was with us, and it was soooo hot outside, Samar (owner) suggested we eat in his restaurant across the street that has a/c. We went over but it was not much cooler.  There were plenty of veg, gf and dairy free options.  I love that there was another counter inside that focused on smoothies and juices. Everyone ordered a mango mint lemonade...it was good but tasted like mango juice and not lemonade. I had the rice and salad box with mushrooms as the \"protein\". It was very flavourful and a fairly large serving. There were a few small tables with chairs and 2 unisex washrooms that were clean. They have recycle and compost bins that made me happy. Those that ordered the fa waffle enjoyed them and did not have much difficulty eating them. This Mediterranean Mexican fusion restaurant was a cool new find! They also have a loyalty program that is very easy to sign up for."}
{"text":"A genius fusion recipe, Middle eastern and Mexican mingled together with the sexiness if punchy herbs and flavors of both worlds.  The creativity is truly inspiring, very impressive to read and always surprising to the tastebuds."}
{"text":"As Karen N and I left the Luminato show tonight, a man approached us and ask if we like falafel. My first thought was, \"who doesn't?\"   Alijandro's Kitchen turns the traditional falafel into waffle cone, a healthy alternative, they say. If you don't pay attention, you'll finish the cone filled with a spicy hummus and well-dressed salad and wonder where the falafel was.   At $7.50 a pop, it almost seems gimmicky and seems like a better deal to get the other items on the menu where you'd probably be more satisfied with your order.   While they advertise that the fawaffle is vegan, and diary free, the fawaffle is the only item that is. They also serve an \"avo chicken\" fawaffle for $10 and a warmed cashew baklava with a scoop of vanilla ice cream topped with pistachios for $5. I tried the baklava, it was ok, the ice cream made the crunch pastry a bit chewy, I'd probably like a slightly bigger dish and have it on the side.   The experience wasn't bad, but I think the best part of a falafel is that it is fried. So I'll probably stick to that."}
{"text":"What a great combination of both middle eastern and Mexican food filled in a genius waffle cone! Coming from New York visiting family here, we desperately need something like this.  The fusion has all the best combinations of both cultures mixed into one delicious, easy to handle meal.  We ordered a taco, raspberry black tea and the fawaffle avo chicken.  Customer service was a huge plus too with attentive staff and friendly fast service. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It's an interesting idea to fuse Mexican and Mediterranean food, but it doesn't quite work. The food is presented very well, but the flavours just don't work in the way they are presented. It's really not that the quality of food is bad, so I assume something here is good, but I was greatly disappointed with the tacos and the fawaffle cone. Even the chips and hummus wasn't up my alley."}
{"text":"Came during their soft opening and tried one of their bowls, which was a mix of salad and rice, topped with chicken, beef and other deliciousness. The bowl was really filling even for the smaller portion. The dish was fresh and tasty, each ingredient enhancing the flavours of the other. The team went above and beyond to ensure customer satisfaction also. I liked the concept of their famous falafel-waffle (fawaffle) in theory though wasn't impressed with its execution, personally. But that's just me :)  Cosy environment with super friendly service and attentive staff. Food is great and worth a try. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"A little gem! The brick and mortar location had great service with super tasty food - I went for the Alijandro Box, which was delish. They were also able to completely accommodate all the dietary needs of our group - gluten-free, dairy free and vegan options."}
{"text":"It was by luck that we were in the area and found parking in front of the place. For a windy night, the place was bare.  There are limited seating area and it was nice that the other half was a smoothie counter, but it was closed when we were there.   I ordered The Alijandro's box with salad, chicken and rice on the side. The portion is generous on a paper takeout container. The seasoning to the chicken is flavourful that it actually looked like beef. The spicy chipotle sauce had a kick and the garlic sauce made it less dry. The disappointment was the crunchy baked chickpeas which were not crunchy at all!!! I would have like other additional veggies like green peppers.   I would go back to try their \"fawaffle\" since I believe that is what they are known for.   Parking might be the biggest issue."}
{"text":"This review is strictly  for the new dine in location of Alijandros that just opened up on Living Arts Drive not the truck since I have not  ordered from the truck .So Dear Yelp, please do not merge this with the other reviews for the truck .   Now onto the review   Saw that Alijandros  dine  location  was open and  I decided to check it out.  Had been meaning to go earlier in the summer to their food truck but  was either in a rush or was checking out other trucks. This time I  saw it open and decided  I will go there and get something . The cashier was very helpful  and he  explained the menu to me.. he said that they offer a fusion of Mediterranean -Mexican cuisine  and let me sample a piece of fawaffle w hummus dip..  He mentioned that they will be opening their dine in area soon. For now the food is to go . I really like the new concept of Medi- mex fusion as it gives  more choices for us to eat  in the city . I got the Al Pastor Chicken Box   half and hald which consisted of  soft and succulent pieces of chicken  with beans , garlic sauce and rice .  The half and half is  half a bed of rice and half a bed of salad upon which the food rests. It tasted quite delicious  and it was a nice harmony of the flavours.. I do plan to return and on my list   is the avo chicken  fawaffle , the chicken taboon  taco, baklava crumble, and  the original fawaffle items  with add ons  like more meat, mushrooms.  Check it out fast before the hype picks up and the long lines begin."}
{"text":"They had a food truck at the Pickering food truck festival and had the fa-waffle.  To be honest it was fa-wafflelicious!  Yes I just said that.  Also their mango mint lemonade is a great drink to pair with the da-waffle.  Really tasty and would order it again :)"}
