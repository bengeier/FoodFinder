{"text":"The food is fresh and good, the service is fast and friendly. Good place to bring visitors to try something different."}
{"text":"Food Quality & Price: Decent price for lunch meals.  The DIY meal bar is always fresh with ingredients refilled.  That is why people go and what people pay for. The drinks are mediocre, stick with water. However, I also did not like the \"buffet\" area with the typical selections of desert, starters and drab entrees. I wouldn't bother with filling myself up with that stuff.   Facility: Located in the Pacific Mall plaza, parking is not too difficult because it is pretty far from the mall. The establishment itself is not bad.  Ambiance is okay, washrooms are clean and has modern decor. Restaurant itself is not in poor condition but definitely not remarkable.  Service: Service seems ... okay.  The hostess is generally kind.  Wait staff seem ... average.  I did not experience bad service nor superior service.  However, I can see how first timers will be confused because no one tells you \"how things work\".  I've been coming here for a long time now, so I feel the only thing worth eating is the DIY food. Newbies, maybe go with someone you know, but it isn't hard to catch on.   Overall: I come for the specific food I want.  Not the service, not the experience, not the buffet, not the dessert.  Just for lunch when I crave Mongolian noodles. Doesn't seem like this restaurant has much to offer outside what it is known for."}
{"text":"Best Mongolia grill place I've been so far. Food is fresh, there is an added precooked buffet station, though not a huge selection, food is good. There is also a small menu you can order straight from the kitchen. Impressed by the staff cleaning the drips between the food dishes, most excellent!   Recommended."}
{"text":"I came to this location by Pacific Mall for a birthday celebration with family on a Sunday night. It wasn't busy at all; only about five tables when we were seated. Our waitress was very dismissive and didn't explain how everything worked. This place is a buffet style Mongolian Grill where you can pick your own mix/variety of meat and sauce and have the chef in the middle stir fry it for you. (Kind of like Fire and Ice in Markham). The chef (like every other waitress there) took my bowl without even looking at me, didn't even crack a smile, and placed my bowl back on the counter without a word after he was done.   Asides from poor customer service, the food was mediocre. Do not order their specialty drinks! I ordered a guava smoothie, and it tasted like water and sugar mixed together, with no hint of guava. The food selection at the buffet is very limited, however, there is a chocolate fondue fountain and a station for shaved ice, which I've never seen before at other buffet style restaurants (ie. Mandarin). The floor was very sticky, everyone's shoes were squeaking.. I don't know what that says about the cleanliness of this place.   When we finished our meal, they brought over a complimentary chocolate mousse cake since we told them it was my birthday (they don't even check ID for that), and played the Happy Birthday song in the background. I thought that was nice, but they placed our bill on the table at the same time they brought the cake.. so again, lacking in customer service..  Overall, would not recommend this place if you want to be treated like a valued customer, but it is good value for those who enjoy primarily meat when dining at buffets."}
{"text":"I love their small plates (appetizers).  They have great appetizers.  The noodle that you make for them to cook is okay. Their fondue is awesome. I love strawberry dipped in chocolate."}
{"text":"dam hard to believe this place is gone within the blink of a eye. Really loved the stirfry the staff is always friendly great service and very clean."}
{"text":"All you can eat Mongolian grill has two locations. The Pacific Mall area is normally busier than the Don Mills. Don Mills has better food selection and more convenient parking. Service is fairly quick and courteous. Price is very competitive (especially with light meal options).  The main draw is the grill, where various meats and seafoods are mixed with veggies and sauce, then grilled on a huge surface. The Don Mills location has better ingredients for your creations. Many of the chiefs will often get quite showy and try to sweep the food into your bowel in a single pass.  The remaining food is typical Asian buffet (stuff like chicken balls or egg rolls) but they do feature good food such as large shrimp and crab legs.  The Pacific Mall location has better desert selections including shaved ices."}
{"text":"Great Khan Mongolian Grill is a cousin-of-unknown-relation to the Mongolian Grills elsewhere in Ontario (Waterloo, Cambridge, ...)  The basic structure is organized around the idea of assembling your own stir fry.  You grab a bowl and start filling it with raw ingredients - meat (chicken, pork, beef, lamb, squid, conch, crab), veg (most of the North American and Chinese standards are available), cooking oil/sauce, and seasonings (chili paste, lemon water, oyster sauce, &c). This is then handed to one of several cooks working a giant circular cooking table with cooking sticks. Over the course of about 60 seconds your food is sizzled up and swept into a fresh bowl.  As you might expect, the restaurant sells pretty hard on the novelty - it's a fun place to bring people for their first time, and if you've got a group that can get into it, you end up with a lot of cross-pollination, people experimenting and trying each other's bowls, swapping tips and then going back up to try again.   There is a decent-but-not-amazing traditional buffet for the cowards in the group so don't let them keep you away from it.  My fav: beef, mushrooms, peppers, bamboo, green onions, udon noodles, spicy szechuan sauce, chili paste, minced garlic. And shaved ice with condensed milk for dessert. I'll often steal a spring roll or some soup from the buffet, too.  It's a big place - groups should be fine, but on busy nights I've seen it with a half hour wait, so call ahead to be sure. It is by no means haute cuisine, and the bar is pretty mediocre, but if you're in the area and want something flavourful, fresh, and a little different, it delivers.  And Steve A. below is right - cheesiest birthday music anywhere. Worth pretending it's your birthday."}
{"text":"While there is a chain of lower end \"Great Khan's\" in the States, mostly in California, it does not appear this place and its other location, Genghis Khan, are related.  The weekend dinner price is 22.99 a person with no extra charges other than beverages.  Like all \"Mongolian\" barbecues, you fill your bowl with raw meat, seafood and veggies, top it with seasonings and give it to the grill man, as other reviewers have described.  On our visit I had two bowls, one with lamb and one with squid.  Both were delicious.  They have a reasonably large choice of veggies.  What I did miss that I've had elsewhere at similar places is whole egg that can be scrambled into your stir fry and well as other veggie protein choices besides plain tofu.   The nice thing about this place, however, is the quite large buffet with some very good Chinese food, plus both Western and Chinese desserts - I like almond tofu and it was nice to see it here.  The buffet also includes several soups, cold shrimp and green-lip mussels, fruit, and even a chocolate fountain with marshmallows which one little boy was having a wild time with.  Due to the large number of eating places at the Pacific Mall and this place's lack of authenticity, it does not seem to get overcrowded.  It is also huge.    None of the items on the buffet or on the grill were losers and many were excellent.  If you are hungry, want a buffet with lots of variety and lots to appeal to kids, this is a good choice.  Decor was sort of suburban higher-end chain variety with a few nice touches.  Service was very pleasant and accommodating.  I found it a bit amusing that one of the newspaper articles posted on the wall was a story about food inspection in Markham and the fact that this place (which did, in fact, appear immaculate) welcomed inspectors at any time."}
{"text":"I was here the other night for dinner only to find that it has been closed and replaced by Yamamoto Japanese (another buffet restaurant).  I will miss the $10.99 all you can eat \"light eater\" pricing, and the self serve stir fry table.  Loved the selection here including the soups, dessert, and chocolate fountain.  Not to mention included in the price was an additional menu checklist where you could order dim sum small dishes (you may need to request this as they often conveniently forget)."}
{"text":"On our last day in the GTA, my family and I had lunch at Great Khan Mongolian Grill.  Walking in, I was surprised that it was a modern, upscale looking buffet.  The buffet food was pretty decent, compared to several other Chinese buffets I've been to back home.  I also liked that you can order quite a few items ala carte with your server.  On the Mongolian BBQ side, they had your usual meats, veggies and sauces.  I've never been to a buffet that had both a buffet, MBBQ and ala carte items included...this place rocks!  They also had a nice array of desserts, including a chocolate fountain.  Granted they used chocolate syrup instead of actual melted chocolate, it was still a nice touch.  That staff was super friendly but a little hard to get their attention as it got a little busy.  They did a last call about 15-minutes before they closed for lunch however, we stayed well after they closed for lunch but, they let us stay while we kept chatting.  Lunch was about $13.00 per person which I thought was a steal but our server asked how many were \"light eaters\" which my Auntie said we all were, so we were only charged $10.00 per person, even better!  I'm glad we sacrificed our hunger at PMall to eat here instead!"}
{"text":"We went for lunch on a Wednesday with a party of thirty people. The waitress was very rude and refused to seat additional people, even though the restaurant was less than half full.   This wasn't the worst of it. As I lined up at the stir fry table, I saw a cockroach running down a pillar next to the area where the ingredients are located. Gross :-\   Will not be going there again."}
{"text":"The place is bigger than how i thought it was going to be. Mongolian Grill is basically a buffet that has 2 sides for you to eat from. 1 side you can cook your own bowl of food. Choices from beef, lamb, pork, artificial crab meat, squid, udon, egg noodles to a lot of other noodles. Also, there were a bunch of sauces for you to choose from. You can either use the ones that are combined by the chefs or you make your own!   The second side has precooked food. Salad, Sweet and SOur pork, garlic bread, cocktail shrimp etc. Also there is a dessert table behind there. There is chocolate fondue, shaved ice, jello, cookies, and fruit. Oh yea, you can choose from a menu they give you on your table. They have many dishes there. Those dishes are cooked inside the kitchen.   Overall, good restaurant with good service. Just one recommendation, don't eat the chocolate fondue because I saw children using their hands to put the marshmallow into the fondue. There are sticks available but they didn't use it."}
{"text":"his was the first time I went to Mongolian Grill and I have to say it was fun! (the food was tasty too!) I went with a large group of people.  The Mongolian Grill in Pacific Mall is really big, there were 2 sections: the regular buffet and the create-your-own-dish buffet. The regular buffet was decent and not much else I can say about since its like any other chinese/mixed Canadian buffet. The create-your-own-dish was pretty cool, there were a lot of choices in terms of meat (beef, pork, chicken, lamb - best one of them all) and a whole section of veggies/noodles. The sauces were pretty good too, there were quite a few to choice from. Watching the chefs cook was really cool, they cooled on a enormous grill using long wooden sticks.  Overall it was a good experience and the food was decent. The price wasn't too bad for a saturday lunch."}
{"text":"Great food at a great price. Probably the cheesiest happy birthday music ever. LOL. Check it out."}
