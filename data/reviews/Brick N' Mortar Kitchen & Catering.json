{"text":"For a Burger and Pizza joint, the food is pretty damn good. The seating is small but really cool. So if your coming on a weekend. Probably gonna wait for a table. The staff is really nice. And did I mention the food is really good!"}
{"text":"Had the \"Flyin' Hawaiian\" for lunch.  The burger was cooked perfectly and the creation of Ham, Pineapple, and aioli put a stop to our lunch conversation.  We were both very happy with the food and hope to be back again.    Between creation and exicusion you won't be disappointed with the burgers.    The only down side is that it is small and hard to find a seat at an actual table.  Another diamond in the rough..."}
{"text":"Very creative menu. Not typical sub/pizza joint. I'm normally not a review writer, but felt like this place deserves the recognition. My wife loves the salads and the house made dressings. Just had the Flankenstein pita wrap. Great steak, marinated perfectly, horseradish dressing was dynamite and the veggies couldn't have been fresher. This is our new go to spot. Great job BNM people!"}
{"text":"AbSoLuTeLy some of the best food I have eaten. My whole family enjoyed the food. The critical husband, the barely eater tween and the picky child. A hidden gem! I live almost 2 hours away and looked through Yelp for advise! Definitely a 5+ star rating from food to service. Nice, kind people who put love in the food they make. Only wish I could rate them on TripAdvisor as well. If you are near this place, you must EAT HERE! You won't be disappointed at all. Now the only thing is I recommend that it gets featured on Guy Fieri show."}
{"text":"We came in close to closing -- but everyone was friendly and had a great attitude. Pizza was fantastic.  Complimentary beer."}
{"text":"I really love the food at this casual spot.  This is the best place to eat in Heidelberg.  The pizza is authentic and the sandwiches, hoagies, and burgers are great too!"}
{"text":"I ask what the best selling item was, Rastafarian sandwich. It was excellent, great flavor perfect size."}
{"text":"Went today for lunch. Incredible!!!!  Tuscan Tom pizza was perfect, couldn't decide what was tastier, cheese or crust.  Special chili today was pork and poblano peppers ...'mmmmmmmmmm. Amazing. Would recommend highly to anyone in Pittsburgh looking to maximum taste with minimum price!"}
{"text":"Ricci catered my husband's birthday last year and everyone raved about the food. We were super excited to hear about Brick N Mortar opening! Finally had a chance to visit this weekend and am happy to report that the food remains just as phenomenal as the first time we had it. We will be back...often!"}
{"text":"Awesome sandwich and the torts were a great change of pace. I am only here for the week but will go back!"}
{"text":"I have nothing but positive things to say about this place . Upon entering establishment I was greeted & asked if this was my first visit ' it was '  then the guy behind counter gave me some suggestions and told me to help myself to the complimentary wine or asked if I would like a Yuengling on draft that was also complimentary . I chose the god father burger & the pork & sauerkraut balls , both where awesome . Today in Pittsburgh we are spoiled with great places to eat & this place gets that & went out of their way to make me feel welcome so even if the food was average that would of made me come back but with this place the food & service are way above average so you can't go wrong . I can't wait to go back to try their Cuban sandwich & sample one of their pizza' s"}
{"text":"Typically too lazy to write reviews, but this place deserves it! Don't be skeptical because of the number of reviews.  This place is awesome with super fresh ingredients! Get the Rastafarian. The jerk chicken was seasoned properly and was juicy and the pita was soft and fresh. The tortilla chips that come with the sandwiches are top notch..dusted with sugar and spices. Get the corn mango salsa with the chips. It's the way to go!"}
{"text":"Posting this is making me hungry again.   As a matter of fact I've already asked to stop tomorrow.   We ordered from Grub Hub today, but it would be great to go in for a bite.  The food was awesome.    I had a beet salad with chicken, and my husband ordered a burger and a hot dog.   I see a lot more food from Brick N Mortar in our future.   It's a great addition to the area."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and it was fast and delicious. Best take out I've had in a long time"}
{"text":"Hands down a must try for anyone! They have a huge menu and I have never been disappointed! The restaurant is quaint and charming for sure! The classic rock makes it even more welcoming, for me at least. The staff is friendly and very helpful also. And the food is absolutely amazing. The Sandwiches are fresh and full of flavor, the burgers are hearty and fit for a king. The entrees are also 5 stars. I highly recommend this for anyone wanting to experience quality and a support a local small business!"}
{"text":"First visit to the Burgh Bites Food Truck - was best lunch I have had in years!  Sandwich was huge and normally I don't finish a sandwich that big but I had to keep going because it was that delicious!  Side of their \"torts\" - tortillas added to my treat.  I will keep looking for this truck everywhere.  Is there such a thing as a food truck groupie??  If it's in your area, don't miss it!!"}
{"text":"Every time I visit Brick N Mortar I am welcomed with a friendly \"How have you been?\". I've never been disappointed with their food. I've enjoyed their Friday Fish sandwich, Pizzas, and their salads. I've yet to be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have heard several good things about this place and thought I would give it a try! I ordered takeout for my husband and I on a weeknight. The woman who answered the phone was very pleasant and informative, helping me with my selection. The food was ready in the amount of time she had stated. The inside of the restaurant was very small, with only a few tables and high tops and a small TV (with the Pens game on). I ordered the Sunshine Salad with Sweet Onion Vinaigrette and the Guido Sandwich. The salad dressing was probably the best part of the salad! I wished there had been a fruit component or a meat on it but the salad was good as it was. The sandwich? Delicious! A unique combination of Italian flavors that worked well together. The cinnamon and sugar \"Torts\" were a wonderful addition to the meal.  Will I try this place again? Absolutely. I originally had trouble narrowing down what I wanted as there were a variety of options - sandwiches, pizzas, burgers, hot dogs (WHAT!), salads, entrees..  I will be back!"}
{"text":"The food here is fresh and good! Great salad dressing. Also great catering trays - they pay attention to detail with finishing touches such as freeh herbs and lemon slices!"}
{"text":"My wife and I found ourselves free from the kids on a Friday Night!  As we were discussing where to go, a friend told us about Brick & Mortar. Sounded Great! So we gave it a try-so glad we did!  It's small, but the food is awesome!  If you get a chance- check it out!"}
{"text":"To make finding this place easier, look for B and M or Brick and Mortar. The Burgh Bites signage is less conspicuous. I ordered the Heidelburger, very good! My friend ordered the Hawaiian burger and also gave it a thumbs up. It took a little while to get our food but I think because it is made to order. They serve the burger with there own version of tortilla chips which were tasty. I recommend you get the corn salsa to go with it, very good! I would definitely return to explore other options on the menu."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend visited this restaurant for the first time today. It's a very beautiful place with real rustic hardwood tables. We tried the Garlique pizza and it was an amazing, fresh, thin crust pizza. And the real treat were the bacon wrapped hotdogs and thier unique sauerkraut that needed no extra toppings. The man working the front named John was very polite and friendly. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great must-try place in the Carnegie-Heidelberg area. Creative menu and the food was fantastic. We will definitely be repeat customers."}
{"text":"Pizza awesome.  Small place, but good music on in the background.  Carry insurrection on tap.  Will be back"}
{"text":"This establishment is small in interior but mammoth in quality. We ordered a brick pizza as an appetizer and man o man was it delicious. It's not your typical pizza with provolone and sauce, it's topped with cheese and Asiago with a nice hint of herb on top. We couldn't stop eating it but had to save room for dinner. The entree consisted of a giant breaded fish sammy on a very nice bun and I had the Asiago chicken. Both meals were perfect and I asked for a beer which wasn't quite chilled yet so instead they brought the customers out a complimentary can of chilled beer. What a perfect evening for us to try our newest favorite."}
{"text":"OK food bad \"service\"-We stopped at Brick n Mortar after walking past and thinking it looked interesting. The restaurant is small with only three tables and a bar. The waitress was standing there but did not greet us or acknowledge our presence. A fellow patron explained to us that you could sit wherever you wanted. We sat at the only available table and waited. After about five minutes we walked up to the bar area to realize that you placed your order at the counter. We placed our order and the waitress brought out our food. I ordered penne primavera, and the penne was overlooked. My husband ordered a sandwich plus a side of tots and a \"snack\" order of salsa from the \"snack\" portion of the menu. His sandwich and tots were decent, but the salsa was just a dish of salsa with no chips. He asked the waitress if he could have chips and she walked away. A man then came out with a small bowl of chips and told us that for future reference, you have to order chips separately but that he was giving them to us for free in case the menu was not clear. It felt a bit like an episode of curb your enthusiasm.  \"How can I eat salsa without chips\"?  At least give me a fork or spoon.  The waitress later came back to ask how the food was. I said that mine was ok and she walked away without asking any further question."}
{"text":"I had the Asia to chicken with fettuccini and it was fabulous.  Very generous portion with an attractive presentation.   My wife had the penne in mortar sauce.  She is a picky eater and she loved the dish."}
{"text":"Love the foot truck and now loveeeeee the restaurant!! Loaded torts are my fav!!! Always have to get them even when we already have order wayyyy too much food. The homemade chips and salsa on the loaded torts are to die for! Me and the hubby went bc they posted a picture of a Reuben. And I will say I'm a sucker for them. I am so happy we went for it. Not only did the Reuben actually look like the picture but it tastes 1000x better I could have even imaged! The homemade dressing was amazing. The meat literally melted in my mouth. My mouth is watering thinking about it now!   The place wasn't busy but my gosh do they do tons of take our orders. If I lived close by I would be ordering everyday! The staff is always so nice and helped us with ordering bc we couldn't make a decision and they even gave us a IC Light! It's the little things that mean so much now a days...  Also they pizzas are super good. We have the mushroom one and we have the guido. Both amazing. Takes longer to come out vs a sandwich but it's homemade so I can't be mad!!! Always fresh ingredients and such awesome people!!!"}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of having dinner with my bestie just last evening and I'm already planning to go back for lunch today with my husband! Their mushroom soup and salads are to die for!!! My friend also had the tomato soup as well as the beet salad and she really enjoyed! I most definitely recommend 1000%"}
{"text":"First timer. Wasn't sure what to expect. We were a group of four; all had different dinners. Amazing food! Great service; will definitely return. Can't wait for the upstairs room to be complete!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Everything seems well thought out, the chef must have an excellent pallet. Great friendly service."}
{"text":"I've had the pleasure of having dinner here twice now! The first time I got a burger, I can't remember the exact name, but it had gardenia mix on it and let me tell you IT WAS SO GOOD!!   When I returned with a group of 9 ladies we got to sit in their private room upstairs. We all sampled different pizzas and salads and honestly loved them all. We also fought over their tortilla chips and salsa. You're really missing out if you do not start your meal with it!!  My favorites of the night were probably the Pizza with the BBQ sauce and the anti hippie salad!   I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is a little gem ! Have done takeout before for a quick dinner and it is always fabulous . Had them cater a birthday party for me and everyone absolutely loved the food . Some of my favorites are the Flankstein, buffalo soldier salad and falafel sliders- the quality of the meats and ingredients is excellent and very reasonably priced , staff could not be nicer! Definitely worth checking out !"}
{"text":"This place amazes me.   I had some friends over and we decided to order delivery.    I ordered a couple of burgers, Loaded Tots, and a Pizza.  All were phenomenal.    A high recommend :)"}
{"text":"Food was good but nothing was right on my order. Paid for pepperoni on my pizza and chicken in my pasta and neither were present."}
{"text":"Whether in the area on purpose or by mistake a good place to get some good food. Seating is limited but good was good."}
{"text":"Insanely delicious!  What a surprise this little gem is.  Can't wait to go back.  The mushroom soup is unique and delish."}
{"text":"What a great spot! I ended up getting the brick and mortar salad!! How delish! I was trying not to make a pig of myself. I am glad that I succeeded in this lol. The salad was a great choice and getting the chance to try some local food!    The salad was delicious it came with bacon. Cheese, egg and I added some of their grilled chicken. The croutons are out of this world delicious. My daughter got a bacon wrapped hotdog and gave me the thumbs up with a smile so she enjoyed them. My husband landed on the Cuban sandwich.   They are expanding, and did I mention they gave us free alcohol! Talk about winning! The lady at the front was extremely patient and recommended things like sweet onion dressing I got! I may end up back here again before we leave! And apparently they deliver!!!"}
{"text":"Surprise.  Surprise. This little place was amazing. Pizza was unique and delicious. My kid is still talking about his bacon dog.  Truly enjoyed my falafel sandwich. Quick, friendly service. All for under $25"}
{"text":"I have kind of mixed feelings about this place. The staff was absolutely wonderful. The food was pretty good and they were great getting the kid's pasta out quickly for my daughter. But this place is tiny. There are only two tables that a smaller kid could sit at, and a couple of counter height bar type tables along the walls. Its definitely great for a lunch joint but probably won't really be able to come back for a family dinner. They're pretty prevalent on the delivery sites so that's more likely for us in the future."}
{"text":"Food flew out of the kitchen, ordered the loaded torts, they were excellent, and the Rastafarian. Meal was so good, and staff is friendly and polite."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried this place out a couple weeks ago. DELICIOUS!!! The staff was friendly & helpful to us choosing our lunches. Everything looked outstanding. The place was small but clean and decorated with charm. Portions were BIG and prices more than reasonable! Will for sure be back. :)"}
{"text":"Brick n Mortar is all of you favorite Burgh's Bites Truck items available all the time plus pizza & more!!! The wife & I finally made the trek across the city to Heidelberg to get our fix. What I can say is the food may possibly be even better.  We love the combination of BBQ sauce on our Mushroom pizza, song with the garlic butter crust. So scrumptious!!  Also it is during lent and Brick n Mortar was offering a lent menu, so of course I tried the catfish po'boy, and I'm so happy I did. The crunch on the fried catfish was awesome, accompanied with pickled cucumbers and onions on a warm pita, I'm drooling thinking about it a day later.  The best thing the wife likes,  is of course her loaded torts, which are like nachos but with pita chips and an array pickled veggies, corn salsa?, cheese and choose of meat. She loved eating them in because they were so nice and fresh & FAST!!!  Now there are only two tables, and probably 12 chairs around the outside of the room. Don't expect to have a 5 course dinner, but I will tell you this place should be in the running for best overall food in Pittsburgh, grab a quick bite or take out.  Don't be like me, and wait to go. Get yourself down to Heidelberg, and thank me later!!"}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant in the area. Great for a quick lunch or pizza night. The staff is so warm and welcoming and always seem to be smiling.   I recently ordered the Rodeo pizza and pickle chips and absolutely loved each."}
{"text":"Such a great little place....excellent food and the owners, workers are awesome! They really take time to answer any questions and go out of their way to accommodate. I took their recommendation and had their \"best seller\" which was a chicken wrap with deliciously chosen extras. Will be back. Want to try everything!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome the food incredible.  It is small and will be expanding soon. Make it if you can"}
{"text":"Placed a large order for myself and co-workers. Have eaten here a few times and really enjoyed the pulled pork in the past.   While waiting to check out, the staff was loudly complaining about our order, frustrated that we asked for a few items on the side & stuff like that. They obviously did not care that there were customers in the store, or that I was right there and able to hear the whole thing.  Our food came out looking pretty half assed, and clearly the worst of the times I've eaten here. Probably won't be returning or recommending it anymore."}
{"text":"The pizza pie here is excellent, and I have also enjoyed some of the sandwiches, along with tots and torts.  They have an interesting variety of drinks and also offer wine and local Insurrection beer on tap.  The dine-in area has room to seat 19 people, and is nicely decorated, The service has always been friendly, professional, and very courteous.  Awesome place!"}
{"text":"I had an awesome Cuban sandwich, my wife had a grilled chicken salad and the kids had the bacon wrapped hotdog. All of our food was exceptional, proceed below what I thought the food was worth and did I mention you get a free glass of wine or beer and you can BYOB.   I believe they are expanding upstairs to provide more seating. Parking is a bit of a hassle but don't let it deter you from trying it out. They also deliver."}
{"text":"Friendly people and simple recipes elevate this hidden gem of Heidelberg. Daily specials accompany an enthusiastic menu of sandwiches (served on pita or on ciabatta), burgers, dogs, pizzas, salads, and sides. Most orders come with a side of freshly seasoned pita chips, which are addicting enough to warrant an order on their own. Free flavored water and cheap glass bottles of pop add the extra effort of care from a restaurant that's already got a good thing going.  My favorites are the sandwiches on pita, or just about anything that has a sauce on it. A lot of the sauce-less sandwiches, though they have things like pickles or coleslaw, are still a bit dry especially when served on the thick and airy ciabatta. The portions are perfect and I've yet to show up and order something I didn't enjoy--though I'm a sucker for finding my favorites and sticking with them (Rastafarian, Flankenstein, Olympian, Fun Guy).  There isn't a lot of seating, but in the summer, there's a nice outdoor area. I haven't tried their food cart, but I'll be sure to check it out the next time I see them!"}
{"text":"WOW! Fantastic little joint with amazingly delicious food. I wish it was bigger inside bcs once people find out about this hidden gem - it's gonna be jammed packed. Give it a try before the secret gets out and you can't get a table & are forced to just takeout!"}
{"text":"Burgh's Bites Food Truck is amazing. Their Brick n Mortar restaurant is equally as impressive. I don't think you could find a sub-par item if you tried. Great flavor, fresh ingredients, and lots of options. Even free beer (granted it's only due to them not having a liquor license yet)!!  Very small interior, I see it as more of a take-out place, or small party sit-down. We went for dinner on Saturday and luckily snatched up a table for 4. We had sandwiches, chips and salsa, and pizza between the group. Everything was delicious.  If I was in this neighborhood, I'd eat here every day. I'd get all my pizzas here. I'd get my lunches to-go daily. I'd order extra and have a late night snack. I'd save some in my fridge and eat it for breakfast. It's just that good."}
{"text":"This is a great addition to the Heidelberg area!! All the food I've tried (burgers, tots, hot dogs, salads, pizza) have all been delicious and consistent. I think it's better to take out as they have a very tiny seating area that gets very crowded on a busy night. The staff is very friendly and accommodating every time I've been there or called. Definitely a hidden gem to check out!!"}
{"text":"These guys are good.  The Burgh Bites truck guys have opened little restaurant that is more take out then eat in.  Only one long table that seats 12 and a few standing places along one wall.   Had the Cuban of a chipotle braised pork should with ham, cheese, truck pickle and a great remoulade.  Wonderful sandwich which came with some signature Torts (flour tortilla chips with some seasoning..also very good.  Also, had a slice of Burgh Bites Slaw that is cabbage with some red and green pepper and some herbs. Will definitely be back to try the pizza and some more of the menu!  Facebook page is: bricknmortarpgh"}
{"text":"The best Chicken Marsala I've ever had!!  Redneck Mac n Cheese was awesome as an appetizer coupled with the spicy Truck Pickles. It's a very small place but don't let that deter you - you will be very happy you stopped."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic and the people that work there are the best ppl in town! You can't go wrong with anything on the menu and I am in love with their torts!!!"}
{"text":"Apparently this place started out as a food truck and diversified into a Brick 'n Mortar establishment as well. I like to think that I'm in the know when it comes to the Pittsburgh food scene, but somehow this place snuck below my radar.  The restaurant is very small, which leads me to believe that they are big in the take out game. I order the loaded torts because apparently they're famous for their tort game and I was not let down. I don't know what they do to those things, but I was in Tort heaven. The seasoning, size, price, everything was spot on. I will definitely be going back to try out more of their menu!"}
