{"text":"The delivery was fast and the delivery dude was nice but it turned out that this would unfortunately be the highlight of the meal. Three words come to mind......BLAND BLAND and oh yes BLAND. All the curries might as well have been slightly thickened coloured water with a good thick oil slick floating atop all of them.  The meats within the curries were cooked well but like the curry sauces themselves, very BLAND and scarce.  The naans were decent and the pakoras were passable.  Stay away even if you're only looking for decent or merely passable Indian food.  I've had much better Indian food out of \"President Choice Memories of......\" Jars or packets."}
{"text":"BAR none the worst  Indian food i have ever eaten,and i have eaten plenty.  To start the delivery took almost 2 hours,the food was greasy,the naan was stale and smelled like 2 week old bread...what a waste of money.  Please save yours and find somewhere else to order from."}
{"text":"1. Delivery was quoted at 60 minutes.  It was 20 minutes late.  2. The driver called me and asked for directions.  I just moved to the area and did not know how to direct him. Regardless, it was kind of bush league on his part, he should have been prepared.  3. By far the worst Indian food I have EVER had.  I was completely shocked at how greasy this food was.  The beef curry was so watered down, it hardly tasted like curry and there was very little meat in the dish.  The vegetable dish was extremely greasy as well, just a bunch of cauliflower doused in oil and sprinkled with a little curry powder. The rice was not fresh. The muttar paneer was not fresh and had a burnt taste to it.  The pakoras and samosas were also ridiculously greasy.  Every place in Little India is probably better than this place."}
{"text":"No frills, tasty Indian at a great price.  Don't listen to the haters. I get delivery from these guys about once a month, and we always get the Dinner for 2 plus maybe a side of Chicken Tikka for about $36.  Enough food for at least 2 full meals, great value.  I would even say this is a one $, not $$ as listed.  We go for the chicken curry (extra hot), and a veg like Channa Masala or Matar Paneer.  Both good choices!  You also get Pakora's, Samosa's, a bit of salad, sauces, Naan.  Again, basic stuff but really fulfilling.  D"}
