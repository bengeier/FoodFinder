{"text":"This place has been a fantastic find for us in Moon! Pizza is awesome. Better than the other options around here. Same with the other pasta dishes. We would highly recommend this place. Delivery is quick. We've always been happy!"}
{"text":"There is no worse service on the planet. Food is metocre at best. I have never received my food with 15 minutes of stated time. Additionally I have been sent the wrong food 2 of 3 times while also arriving 15+ minutes late. Can't wait for a Papa Johns in Moon. Do not order from this shithole."}
{"text":"The guy who took my order was extremely friendly and pleasant, as for the girl at the counter who I picked it up from? Not so much. The pizza was pretty good, a slight crisp on the bottom, no thick crust on the edges. I think the toppings could have covered the sauce a little better especially since I ordered extra cheese and there was nothing extra about it. Also a little too much sauce for my taste. Overall though it was good and I would likely order again. If they were a little more generous with the toppings (especially when the customer pays for extra) they could give Geraci's a run for their money."}
{"text":"Have had pizza and the fish sandwich several times. In the beginning both were delicious. Then, the fish was overcooked and the pizza was soggy. Still, we ordered from them as we had been pleased in the past. Well, tonight we ordered pizza and the fish and chips. I always order a thin crust pizza, well done. The pizza this evening was more than soggy! It wasn't even cooked. Yes, the sauce and toppings were fine, but the crust was inedible. I had to put in the oven. Even then, it came out soggy. I think they added too much water to the dough. As for the fish - tasteless. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Roma has great food and a decent atmosphere. The food and drinks are reasonably priced and the specials are usually a great deal. The regulars of which there are many are friendly, but the staff at the bar will look right through you if you aren't a regular. When not ignoring you they will be patronizing and occasionally sprinkle in a bit of good service."}
{"text":"I live within a few minutes of this pizza shop and used to be a regular here. The pizza is honestly pretty good. My favorite is the buffalo chicken pizza which is topped with breaded chicken - super yummy. I've had a few other things like the pepperoni rolls which I really liked too.

However, the service lately has been terrible to the point where I've stopped ordering from here entirely. This place used to have friendlier staff members who I don't see around anymore. The last several times I tried ordering here, the cashiers who took my order were extremely rude. They also have some odd rules that must be new - like no mixing toppings. For example, they refused to make my usual pizza which simply involves adding bacon on one half of the pizza. When I politely mentioned having always ordered it in the past, the cashier snapped at me and told me if I want two different kinds of pizza then I'd have to order two different pizzas. Asking for something like extra sauce on the side was also impossible.

The pizza is great, but going here just isn't worth the frustration of dealing with rude employees, especially when Moon has plenty of other pizza places to choose from..."}
{"text":"My coworker and I ordered on a whim and we're glad we did! The California Dreaming pizza... awesome! Antipasto salad...awesome! We will order again, the quality and price are right! Yum-O!"}
{"text":"Ok, we were passing through town and found this by chance and the owner suggested the meatball sub and WOW it was seriously great! The only sad part is I live in Texas and won't be back yet will remember this place. And if you live near here consider yourself lucky the food was great and the owner was so inviting, thanks for a great lunch break on our way home to Austin, Tx."}
{"text":"been going there for yrs now pizza is fantastic and grace the owner is very nice highly recommended best pizza by far in town"}
{"text":"We order delivery from Pizza Roma at least once a week. Pizza is excellent, price is reasonable and delivery is always fast. They are one of the few places that does a very good sicilian style but their traditional is excellent as well."}
{"text":"I happen to bump into the Owner and she was more then happy to give me a Free slice of Pepperoni. I was very impressed at the taste and the presentation."}
{"text":"Best hot sausage sub I have found so far. It's a small place, family owned.  Stop in."}
{"text":"This is our go-to pizza place in Moon - reliable delivery, and a clean, simple dining room.  The pizza is great, and the typical sides, garlic knots, breadsticks, etc... are also very good.  Can't say I've ever had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Ordered food, was told 20 minutes, go to pick up they didn't start my order. They said sorry they got busy. Tried a new pizza place! Loved the new place, Won't be back here. Horrible customer service!"}
{"text":"On a business trip and needed to get some food so I could work in the hotel.  Cashier was nice and promptly took my order.  Food was done in about 15 mins.  The garden salad contained romaine, tomatoes, cucumber,  olives and roasted peppers.  Very nice and the ranch dressing was good.  Also got a single order (8) of wings with the hot Cajun seasoning.   Asked for well done and actually for well done.  Very happy.  Spice and heat was perfect.   Plasticware and napkins were provided."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Try the Sicilian pizza.  It Is Terrific! We were  in from out of town and looking for good pizza and found it.  Grace was super nice."}
{"text":"This is a family owned place with delicious food and great/friendly service. I'd recommend the meatball calzone! Wonderful! It's a bit small for a sit down dinner, but pick up or delivery would be fine. I'll definitely be back when I'm in town!"}
{"text":"I've loved this spot for the last two years but today I'm afraid that love has stopped. My husband and I ordered online at 5:45, just a calzone and a salad. It gave an estimated 30-45 mins as usual. After an hour of waiting, my husband called in to check on the status since our food wasn't here yet. The girl who answered said we were the driver's first stop and he would be at our house in \"7 minutes.\" Half an hour later, the driver shows up with our food. I wouldn't be as upset if they were honest about how much longer it would be but an hour and a half is a little ridiculous. I think it's safe to say we will no longer be taking our business there. Update to top this off: they put my online order in wrong so my salad was wrong with the wrong dressing."}
{"text":"Pizza Roma has some of the best pizza around. They are always my friends and I's go to place when we need a bite in the middle of the night. The staff is friendly and the store is inviting and comfortable."}
{"text":"great food for great prices good people who care about the costumer eat in or carry out or stop by and have a drink Pizza Roma   it's a great place check it out save me a  slice"}
{"text":"I ate at Pizza Roma with my husband back in August and I have been meaning to write a review ever since. Pizza Roma is not only one of the best pizza's I've ever had, but they also have amazing salads for something a bit healthier.  The owner Grace is so sweet and I'm already looking forward to coming back just to talk to Grace.  The atmosphere is friendly and inviting.  I wasn't sure what I wanted to order and Grace let me try a variety of things to help make my decision easier.  Thank you Pizza Roma for the wonderful experience!  There is no need to go to any other pizza place in Cleveland, take my word for it!  Pizza Roma is the only place you need to go!"}
{"text":"Yesterday was our first visit to Pizza Roma on Route 910.  We had the Sicilian Pizza with mushroom and pepperoni.  It was thick, fresh ,and delicious.  Service was adequate.  We will be back to try their hoagies and thin crust pizza. 

Update: tried the thin crust pizza and hoagies, both were very good."}
{"text":"Ordered a deep dish pizza.  Good, but way too much sauce for me."}
{"text":"I called on Friday April 20 @ 6:22p.m. in the beginning of phone conversation the employee stated we're quoting at least an hour. I said that was fine. I had family in from out of town the pens playoff game started at 7 I figured that would be perfect. Food was not delivered until 7:45p.m. First time I called employee stated driver left 15 mins ago and I'm next which was about 7:30. Driver came and only had 2 of the 4 items I ordered. When I called to make them aware of the situation the manager of ALL people argued with me about my order and at first refused to compensate for the inconvenience. Not only were the pizzas barely warm I was missing my hoagie and wings which (the employee) stated was called the Trifecta and the manager still refused to make it right. After arguing for about 10 mins he said I would get a discount and fresh hot wings and hoagie. Wings were new hoagie was old. Such a shame.. Food is good service sucks!!!! Really disappointed being I'm in the service industry."}
{"text":"Owner Chad Schenker and his crew of outgoing friendly Staff, will treat your taste buds to a variety of delicious Pizza's, Hoagies, wings and specialty Menu items.  Including the Crowd Pleasing Chicken Parmesan!!"}
{"text":"I was staying at the Hilton Garden and this Pizza joint popped into my Droid map application, so I thought \"what the heck\".  I ordered the Hawaiian Calzone along with a side dinner salad with their house sweet and sour poppy dressing.  I ordered the food for delivery and it took about double the amount of time (60 minutes) to arrive, even though it was pretty early in the dinner period.

The calzone was really quite large although it was really doughy and thick.  That normally would have been something I would not have liked, but they included a really tasty garlic butter that had some Parmesan cheese mixed.  Really tasty and a nice touch with the thicker dough Calzone.  Nice job.

The side salad was a nice portion and the house dressing was pretty tasty.

Now if you guys would only improve your delivery times and send silverware and napkins to a hotel customer, I would be quite happy.

I will order again and update my star rating if they deserve it with my return patronage."}
{"text":"I live in DC and THIS is my favorite pizza by far.  Could eat it every night and think about it often when I am in not in Ohio."}
{"text":"The pizza was really good.  We went late night looking for pizza hut and came across this place instead.  The flavor was really good!  Service and price is really good also."}
{"text":"Best fresh pie around. I recommend the pepperoni pizza. It is delicious. Stop by for the pie!"}
{"text":"This is a super small pizza joint, so if I had to complain about anything it would simply be that if it's crowded there's nowhere to sit and you'd have to go elsewhere. Other than that, I loved Pizza Roma. The toppings were so good and the crust was crispy - just like I like it. Yum yum yum."}
{"text":"I'm so happy they have Sicilian pizza.  Not many pizza places have that.  Pizza Roma has a good menu.

FOOD:  I always get 2 Sicilian cheese pizza slices and fried zucchini without cheese sprinkled on top.  I love their thick crust Sicilian pizza but I'm not a huge fan of their cheese. That's why I get their fried zucchini without the cheese.  Their small tossed salad it a big portion of lettuce, peppers and olives.  Overall it's a good meal!"}
{"text":"We'd ordered from here a few years ago when they first opened and thought it was really good pizza. Though maybe it was a different establishment because last night was terrible.

This is a family run business and we understand how important reviews are. However, from a customer standpoint, we were upset that we felt obligated to pay for our order because it was the worst, most over cooked pizza/ that tasted like cardboard when eaten at home. We threw away, that's how bad it was.

In addition to that pizza, we'd ordered a small bacon cheeseburger pizza. When we picked up our order, we opened the pizza boxes and immediately turned away the bacon cheeseburger pizza. The beef looked like cat pellets and so dry. The girl profusely explained that this was the meat itself. We felt obligated to pay for the rest of our order - medium chicken/bacon pizza, side of meatballs, their signature recipe they say, and an \"Italian salad\" - $4 for brown iceberg lettuce, 2 small slices of onion, bad tomatoes and a sprinkling of cheese. All of their dressings are bottled. Gross. And, the meatballs are just ok...you can make better at home!

 I'd never return and am writing this review for fellow Yelpers looking for good pizza in the area. We recommend going elsewhere."}
{"text":"There are so many pizza places and not enough time to try them all!!!! 

So it was my coworkers turn to pick our Friday lunch takeout, and if I usually pick Asian, he usually picks pizza. Pizza Roma was his weapon of choice this week. They have a nice wide selection on the menu: wings, salads, pizza, calzones, pasta, hoagies/wedgies, and a couple of desserts. Their pizza is usually served with a crust hard on the outside, soft on the inside(mmm-mmm!!!). On this occasion I got a Greek salad, however. Honestly, it was nothing spectacular. Black olives, feta cheese, 2 pickled peppers, and dressing on lettuce. I had asked for them to leave the peppers off of the salad, but ended up with the little buggers anyway. Well my coworker didn't let them go to waste. He ordered a calzone, which is an individual size and not large enough to share...unless you eat like a mouse (nibble nibble). 

Delivery time was average for the area (around 40 minutes) and the food is fresh tasting. Overall, average is what I'd rate Pizza Roma."}
{"text":"The price is great and it has that neighborhood pizza shop feel.  It's clean as well.  

The people are good, not great.  Helpful when they need to be, mostly friendly.  They just don't stand out as amazing or anything.

They recently changed their menu and I can say that the only thing worth getting is the Pizza, which is excellent.  Seriously good Pizza that doesn't go cheap on the toppings, is very flavorful, and is piping hot.  I am a regular here just for the pizza.  They also have a good 2 slice and a drink deal for around $5.

The rest of the food is sub-par, particularly the pasta.  Their baked ziti is the worst I've ever had and I'll never get it again.  They should scale down their menu and offer more pizza options... it would serve them well.

Also, this is a pet peeve of mine. . . they have a TV in the place and show the wrong thing all the time.  I've been in during Monday football and they've had re-runs on, I've been in during a Pirates game and they have ESPN on.  It makes no sense.

All in all, it's a pretty good place to stop if you want good pizza.  You won't be disappointed.  Not so good for anything else."}
{"text":"People in northeastern Ohio do not know pizza. I had all but given up on finding a good pizza place and this is it. Most pizza places I would label not much better than barfood much less gas station food. The pizza from beginning to end was excellent. It was soft yet crispy the pepperonis were perfectly spicy and the sauce was magnificent. I don't know of another place that could rival the flavor and texture of their meatballs. Grace the owner was super friendly and fun to be around. You could tell she genuinely wanted to know your name. Kudos to her father for pushing her into making pizza."}
{"text":"Had a terrible experience here. They forgot half the orders at our table and we waited for 40 minutes. Worst of all, the employee and someone who looked to be a manager working didn't even propose to put a portion of the meal on the house. I didn't say anything, but just very bad etiquette, a restaurant should take responsibility for mistakes if they want return business.

Oh, and the Italian calzone was terrible with hardly any meat and all peppers."}
{"text":"This is their chef salad for $8???? It's ice berg lettuce, mozzarella cheese, 4 quarters of tomato, and three slices of onion....what???? So disappointed!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS NOT CLOSED....
I've passed this place up probably 100 times or more over the last 2 years. I finally stopped by for dinner before class. The cajun chicken sandwich was delicious. They have a happy hour between 4-6 PM daily at the bar. They will pass around food that the cook makes for the crew. Today they passed around a large Sicilian pizza. It's FREE because it's happy hour. Good people, and great food. Worth checking out.

{"text":"Pizza Roma is always consistent with their quality of food and has the friendly front end staff to back it up. Orders come out very quickly and always arrive hot and fresh. Very nice place to order for delivery as well as sit down service."}
{"text":"California Dreamin pizza and meatball calzone were fresh and perfectly baked.  Loved the fried dough with powdered and cinnamon sugar.  Service was wonderful.  Both the girls working were polite and helpful."}
{"text":"We came to Cleveland and tried this pizza shop and loved it!  It is a small place with a friendly atmosphere and the owner was very friendly letting us taste a variety of things including the fried dough. We ordered the meatballs which were homemade and delicious.  The salad was fresh and the homemade dressing was just as impressive.   We also had a mushroom and sausage pizza and we were pleased to see the mushrooms were fresh!  We will definitely go back to this place."}
{"text":"Tried the pizza and it was typical pizza, not to thick crust, good pepperoni, average sauce that was not very spicy.  This place also has a restaurant and next door a bar."}
{"text":"I appreciate pizza romas commitment to hiring recovering drug addicts, teen moms and the mentally challenged but: the quality of the food they tried to sell us today, along with the ridiculous wait times
(30 minutes for what was quoted as 10) have lost you a customer for life.
The cherry on top was the lack of any apology from the 'manager' and the disparaging comments from a man who looked like his mother was a meth addict and his father was a rat.
There are too many options for pizza in and around moon twp to have to put up with substandard food and service. 
Obviously the owners don't care and it shows."}
{"text":"Simple order...and you couldn't get it right. Half Italian with extra tomato's.  You charged me and I ended up with half an Italian NO tomatoes. Really how hard is it?? My bread, lettuce and cold-cut sandwich was mediocre at best. Thanks for an underwhelming dining experience."}
{"text":"By far the best pizza in the area. They have really great pasta too. Wish the delivered to us but we make the drive past several other pizza places to go here."}
{"text":"I've been going there for years.Friendly staff experience cooks,great atmosphere, with DELICIOUS Entrées. Check it out ,you won't be sorry,"}
{"text":"Stopped in for some drinks Saturday night. We didn't get there until 10:30. It wasn't too crowded.   It happened to be free juke box night, which probably kept us there another few hours. :) we ordered pizza and French fries.  Both were really good.  The bartender was really personable.  They have specials every night."}
{"text":"This pizza was some of the best pizza I have had in northeast Ohio (and I've eaten at basically every popular pizza place in the Cleveland area).

The crust was very good, a slight crisp, but still chewy, with almost no wasted space on the edges.

The sauce definitely tastes homemade, and has a ton of flavor. Tastes like a good Sicilian tomato sauce.
Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"People/servers were nice and accommodating. Pizza was just terrible-crust is doughy and oily. Hardly any sauce. Chicken on pizza resembled spongy chicken nuggets. The salad we ordered also had a long hair in it. Would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Me: hello can I please have a pizza by the slice?
Pizza Roma woman 1:  absolutely! Tell her what we have
Pizza Roma Woman 2: We have cheese, pepperoni and a \"pizza sausage\". 
Me: what is pizza sausage? Like a pizza wrapped around a sausage?
Pizza Roma Woman 2: kind of. It's DELICIOUS.
Me: DELICIOUS? Okay I'll try that
(Me dreaming of a specialty calzone like my name is Ben Wyatt)

A square piece of baked pizza dough, with pizza sauce and Parmesan cheese... and a sausage link placed on top. The display made me uncomfortable ... I should have tried the pizza. It tasted alright and I'm sure a (enter deep voice) big hearty Italian sausage isn't cheap... but here's my issue: false advertising (to be dramatic)... it offered to me as an option for pizza by the slice. It cost twice as much and was not DELICIOUS... it was expensive (a delicious polish boy is $3 down the way). 

Pizza Roma Woman 1 asked how was it, I was kind and told her I didn't care for it but was eager to go, nor did she ask. Then I learned it was $5.75, expressed my surprise, payed my bill and left hurriedly."}
