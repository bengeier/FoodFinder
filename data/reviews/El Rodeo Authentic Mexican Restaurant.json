{"text":"I wanted mexican food and drove by this place a few times before saying \"I am gonna go there for lunch, what the heck?\" so the place gets really packed during lunch. I thought that was a good sign. inside its very colorful, I guess they are going for that ethnic look. lol The service was quick and the staff was very friendly. They first bring out some salsa and chips, they are ok, I have had better. I have family in Texas and I have also traveled to Mexico a lot, so this salsa just wasn't cutting it. I had the enchiladas verdes, once again the dish was good, but not extraordinary. Everything tasted fresh and the places appeared to be clean. I guess I would go again if I crave a Mexican food fix."}
{"text":"Service was very friendly and accommodating. They did forget a few drinks but with a table of 20 it could have just been a backup in the bar? I was here with a very large group and everything was wonderful even my custom dish!"}
{"text":"SO BUMMED that this place closed as of April, 2011. This was one of my favorite places!"}
{"text":"Pros: looks very authentic when you enter.  The tables look very cultural. I have never seen so much colorful furniture in a restaurant. The food is cheap, and it was good.  Very flavorable and the waiter was helpful.  Cons: It looked like there was only two waiters to service the whole restaurant.  Conclusion: It was a good eat here.  I was really surprised by the quality of the food, with such low prices"}
{"text":"Very good food, fast & friendly service. Serves the typical mexican fare, but in large delicious portions. This is one of the most festive restaurants, bight colors and paintings. I didn't think it could get more festive until I visited at Christmas, and wow! The prices are right too! Great experience and I have been back several times."}
{"text":"I consider myself a Mexican restaurant guru. I love authentic Mexican food.  Three things I look for in a Mexican restaurant are chips & salsa, fast service, and good prices. El Rodeo hits all three. The salsa has a but of a kick which I love!  The chips were a bit bland but the salsa more than made up for it. Service was fast. I was in and out for lunch in 30 min. The prices were great. My lunch was under $10. They also have $5 specials. The food was good but not the best. It was the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. The soups are really good. The fajitas are excellent. They have a very good spicy sauce that you have to ask for. The corn chips appear to be home made as well as the flavorful salsa. The portions can be measured in enorms. The combination plates are ridiculous. I would say you can feed a family of 4 with 2 combo plates that are like 10$ a piece. Some of the food is authentic but not most. Too many dishes with ground beef. But the food seems to be very fresh. The drinks are really cheap, its hard not to get shi*-faced. Like 6 bucks for a pitcher of beer and specials. The service is very efficient and friendly. The place definitely has a Disney Mexican decor going."}
{"text":"Great mexican food at very reasonable prices. Fast service tables usually available even on saturdays."}
{"text":"This is Mexican for ya.   There isn't anything fancy at all about El Rodeo. It feels like a little Ma & Pa joint you would find on Venice Blvd. in LA. You may not know what everything is made of, but it just tastes yummy.  The guacamole is great, and there are lots of vegetarian options. There is a full bar which offers some insane happy hours like 50cent drinks on...can't remember which night.  Oh, and it has something like kids eat free on some night. If you like Mexican and just want the bare bones deal you will be very pleased with the taste of El Rodeo."}
{"text":"Not my favorite Mexican restaurant, but good value and service. Great deals offered through happy hour/ specials. The service was great too. A fun and colorful atmosphere too.   Tips: don't order anything with ground beef. It tastes flavorless--much like dog food. The shredded chicken is far better--juicy and tender   Also, do yourself a favor and upgrade to the cuervo margaritas at least. The house margaritas are too sweet--practically straight lime juice. I could tell just by looking at the golden color of the cuervo margarita that itwas worlds better! (and it was)"}
{"text":"I have to completely agree with Jeff B. on what used to be El Rodeo since its been closed now for a couple months.  The food here was solid and the drink specials (buckets) had me going back again and again.  I would feel free to try any El Rodeo location that's still operating but I'm marking this location as closed.  Sorry!"}
