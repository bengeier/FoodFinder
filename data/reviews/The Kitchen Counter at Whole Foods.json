{"text":"The Kitchen Counter at the University Heights Whole Foods is a weekly go-to for us.  The menu changes seasonally and you can always expect each dish to be prepared fresh in front of you and to be packed with flavor.  If you don't fee like any of the seasonal menu items or tasty apps, the counter also makes burgers (including turkey, veggie and portobello mushroom burgers) to order as well.  They have a selection of about 6 wines (red and white) on the seasonal menu at prices you would find on the store shelves (~$15-$25 per bottle). If you don't like the wine options on the menu you can grab a different one out of the store's wine section a few feet away and drink that for the shelf price plus a $5 corkage fee.   You are also welcome to grab beers or any non-alcoholic beverages from within the store off the shelf and they will ring it up at the counter with your final bill (if you need one or two grocery items to take home they will ring them up there as well). 

They host different events weekly including wine tasting Wednesdays, beer tasting Thursdays and foodie Fridays.  All of which are a lot of fun.  

The people that work at the counter (frank the chef, dee the burger chef, Sarah the \"hostess/wait staff\" and everyone else) are all extremely nice, accommodating and are happy to join in light conversation with you as they work.  The menu says \"tips are not necessary\" but we always like to give them something since they do such a great job.

Favorite dishes:  Salmon (which comes in different forms depending on season) and pirogies (with bacon and crème fraîche)."}
{"text":"We stopped by for an early dinner. Thanks for going out of your way to make me sweet potato fries from scratch and sautéing them in the back. There is a chance of gluten/wheat cross contamination due to the shared oil and I couldn't risk getting sick. The gold rush cocktail was wonderful. I enjoyed a red blend that complemented my burger perfectly."}
{"text":"Weekend brunch is off the chains good. Highly recommend the buttermilk chicken and biscuits, a chefs personal recipe not a corporate thing. Worthy as a stand alone visit even if not grocery shopping."}
{"text":"I never thought I would write a rave review for a restaurant inside a grocery store, but that's what I'm about to do.

Whole Foods \"whole paycheck\" moniker is accurate if you don't go in there with a solid strategy, but they're actually pretty reasonable for the quality for a lot of things.  And for the quality, this little restaurant is a great deal!  Especially if you want a burger.  A junior (1 patty) burger is only $5, and a regular burger is $7.  Even if you want cole slaw or fries, you can still get a great meal for $6-$10.  The burger is better than any other $5 I've ever had, and honestly holds its own against the pricier options of my burger-eating past.  You can't go wrong with a make-your-own burger (the jalapeños are always a good choice) and all of the Dave's Special Burgers are guaranteed to be great too.

For obvious reasons, the burger is my go-to, but the menu doesn't stop there.  The salmon is excellent.  We've also enjoyed the pasta of the day (beet ravioli when I tried it), fish and chips, a steak dish, and the chicken wings.  They have a short but nice wine list, and they rotate some great beers through their taps.  Beer prices are usually very reasonable, and they even sell growlers.

The employees are all really friendly and helpful, which really adds to the open kitchen concept.  We've visited at least once a week for dine-in or take-out since we moved to the neighborhood, and for good reason.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Been coming here for their burgers for a long time... and they are amazing!! Came in to try their appetizers... 3 for $20 - what a great deal! Got the Rosemary garlic wings - came as 4 full wings, calamari - lightly breaded, perfect crisp, and awesomely not greasy, and a big a$$ bowl of mussels - made with beer and bacon! A ton of food for $20! Wow! They were busy and they warned that wait is about 20 mins for my food - which isn't any longer wait than your average restaurant - and it was totally worth it! Totally coming back for more than just the burgers next time! It's pretty much bar-style seating. A bar surrounds the open kitchen, conveniently near the beer and wine section of the market. You see the cooks prepare your food and when they're done, they put it directly in front of you. And they have a pretty sweet looking brunch menu on the weekends for $8-$10... crazy!"}
{"text":"This review is only for the $5 burger night on Tuesdays. $5 gets you a burger and side of fries with basic options for toppings, lettuce, tomato, ketchup, mustard, etc., nothing fancy. I had the veggie burger which is really the Beyond Meat burger. I would have preferred an actual and less processed veggie burger, and didn't care for the taste of the burger at all. My husband found his beef burger really bland. The fries were decent but a bit undercooked. We love Whole Foods but won't be returning for Burger night with so many other good options."}
{"text":"One of the best spot for a burger. All of the meat is fresh, never frozen (including the fries), and made fresh to order. This place suites every picky eater as you get to customize everything with Whole Foods ingredients.
We will be back on the regular! Thanks for the amazing chef skills Quentin!"}
{"text":"My wife and I are there yesterday, Sunday. The food was very good. Service was great. We had the chicken picatta. Excellent. The salmon  we had at another time is also excellent!"}
{"text":"I never thought I'd be writing a review for this place. But, here I am. 
We landed here a few weeks ago, because we needed a few groceries and I wanted to speak to the manager about my upcoming benefit. 
We sat down and the guy behind the counter was so seriously awesome. We immediately clicked and I asked for his opinion on what foods to get.

He recommended the peirogi to start with.....Uhhh, you don't have to tell me twice. We ordered that and 2 lemonades. 

When our starters got there, holy smokes. Those were some damn good peirogi. The pears glaze and fresh pears just went together. It was incredible. 

We then ordered the special burger and my husband made his own burger. You can most definitely taste the fresh in the meat. Wow! I inhaled all of it. 
I was too full to eat all of my fries, so we took them home. Way to represent healthy natural eating whole foods!"}
{"text":"Burgers are ok.  Calamari was right out of a Whole Foods frozen box - hard to imagine given its proximity to the seafood section.  Reasonable selections of beer and wine.  It's difficult to find a seat during busy times."}
{"text":"Frank, Lauren & Adam will cook you an excellent meal. The food is fantastic at a reasonable price."}
