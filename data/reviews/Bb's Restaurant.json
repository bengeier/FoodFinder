{"text":"Some friends brought to BB's last night for the fish fry. For $4.95 I wasn't expectiang much. Boy was I wrong! LOL It came with 2 good size pieces of fish, very good fries and some coleslaw. Plus a slice of lemon and tartar sauce! And they even had Pinot Grigio wine available. If your looking for fine dining and fancy, this is not it. If your looking for decent food for a decent price and very good service, I highly recommend. The place from the front looks like a little hole in the wall, but it's HUGE inside!"}
{"text":"Went there with as part of a group of 9 to hear music.  The music was good, crowd was lively and fun. Crowd that night skewed older, as is typical for the area. It took a long time to get seated with 'reservations'. No one seemed to understand who had written what, or where. I stood around at least 20 minutes while someone disappeared to figure that out.   People were up and getting their groove on. 4 stars for the music. Zero for the rest. Cover of $15/head is very high for this area and this space, which is basically a large barren room with tables and chairs.   Food and service?  It was awful.  I ordered a shrimp skewer and crab cake from the 'special event' limited menu.  There was no skewer. There were 3 tiny frozen shrimp on the side of what was a salmon type patty that was like cardboard and inedible for $14.95.   Vegetables were mush and served with mashed potatoes smothered in brown beef-based gravy. Mashed potatos were the only offering, by the way.   One person ordered chicken which she said she would need a chain saw to cut. The man next to me ordered the chopped steak which was equally bad. After a friend ordered mushroom soup, the server came and said they weren't serving it now due to complaints. Dieter tried to order a lettuce and tomato only salad but was told they couldn't do that because the salads were already made. No leftover lettuce?  The worse insult was the server told us their 'chef' was from France. We joked they must have deported him.  It tastes like the food was cooked elsewhere, two days before, and brought in to serve. It was hard to order drinks because they don't have most call brands. One friend had a class of wine. She tried to order a 2nd and was told they ran out. Of house wine. At 8 pm. We ended up going out to eat after we left.  I support live music so I would go again for that. Next time I will know to eat before I go."}
{"text":"My fiance and I took our grandson there for a night just to see what the atmosphere was.  We had a blast.  My grandson who is 6 years old got on the dance floor and danced to the live music.  Which was a mixture of genres.  

We went back a couple of weeks later and really enjoyed ourselves again.  We are getting a group together for this Saturday for another live show.

My fiance and I were the youngest people in the room, however we still had an amazing time as everyone was there to have fun and dance the night away..  

We are definitely going to be regulars!!!"}

{"text":"OMG! Where do I start? Have been going there for about two months or so, only because we don't have a lot of good bar and grills in Sun City. It has been a nightmare but we hung in there because we thought it might improve. The singer of the group can't carry a tune in a bucket and I mentioned that to the Manager as well as the fact that the same female singer came down on the dance floor and put on her own show of dancing by herself while lifting her shirt to show her belly while she was surrounded by a group of people who follow them from place to place stood in a circle and clapped and dominated the dance floor so that there was just barely room for anyone but them. The manager told me that all that mattered to her was that they packed the place on Friday nights.  No one in that place communicates with each other!! We bought tickets for a show about a month and a half  ago. Tickets said \"Call for Reservations.\" One of our group tried to call for several days and no one answered the phone. She left several messages, but never got a call back. Finally, the day of the show I went in person and told them that we had attempted to call. They said that there was a problem with Cox and the phone. First she (the manager) said that they didn't take reservations. I showed her on the tickets where it said to call for reservations. She didn't like the fact that I called her on it. She finally said she would try to find us a table. When we got there that night, we had a table at the very back corner. I'm sure that was intentional.We let it go and when this group was supposed to come back.
 We bought tickets for the next show about two or three weeks ago from the designated person there (the bartender) and reserved a certain table. We had originally been told once again that they didn't take reservations and then said it would have to be put \"in the book.\" When we reserved the table, all information was entered into \"the book\" names, table number and we paid for the tickets right then.We were assured that the table was reserved and would be ready for us when we came. 
We arrived there last night and low and behold, they had seated the table to another group. Then I found out that the one of the group had taken the sign that was on the table stating that it at the other table had been reserved, the table number and the name it was reserved under and moved it to the table behind them, which is were we ended up sitting. I went to the bar ans spoke to a woman who said she was aware of it and that the other had probably reserved it before us and that they go by \"the book\" of reservations. The same book that had our information in it. It got into a confrontation and it was apparent that they were not going to take the responsibility for the error. It ended up by my telling them that we will not come back there. I went back to the table and asked the woman at the other table if she was aware that that table had been reserved by us, she turned on me like a pitt bull and said, \"Yes, I knew, but this is where they seated us, Sweetheart, so if you have any problem with that, take it up with the management!\" 

At that point, the woman from the bar came and took drink orders from other tables, but never came to us. I finally had to scream at her at the top of my lungs to get her to acknowledge us. Her remark to me was that I needed to nice. She took the order and never came back. Finally the manager of the place came and asked us if we needed a drink. We ordered and when she brought the drinks back, she told me and my fiancee that our drinks were on her. 

This place is so screwed up. The service is terrible and the wait staff is very rude, ?There is one waitress there who is very nice. little red headed girl. We had a waitress who told us one night to be sure that we ordered everything we wanted then, because she had to go all the way to the front bar to get them and didn't want to be running back and forth! Another time she barked at our table when we couldn't get her attention. They rarely come back and ask if you need a refill. 

It's not just us that have been treated like this and gotten different stories from management as to the rules etc. It has happened to many others. Maybe they just didn't know about this web site! We will go back only if the other group (the fill in group) comes (Jack and P.J.) as we have told them we will support them. They are great and they also play at \"The Lakes at West Brook Village.\" 

To round this place out: poor service, poor management and by the way, what the hell was a 6 year old kid doing in a bar? (see review from the grandmother)"}
