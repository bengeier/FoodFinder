{"text":"I really love Newks - their food is so fresh and tasty.   My go to choice here is the Grilled Chicken Sandwich. The bread that it's made on is SO fresh and tasty (I've heard they make their bread fresh daily). The chicken has such a good flavor and is topped perfectly with lettuce, honey mustard, tomatoes, and bacon! The sandwich is quite filling in my opinion so I can usually save the other half for dinner! The sandwich comes with a choice of side (chips, fruit, mac n cheese, etc).  They're known for their sandwiches, salads, and soups. They also have pizza as well.   This location is in the heart of Uptown so it can definitely get crowded during lunch. I'd say the lunch rush starts around 11:30AM and doesnt end until 1:30PM.  My advice.. ORDER ONLINE. It's easier to customize there and very easy to pick up inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Newks! The salads are so fresh and delicious! I can eat healthy and feel satisfied. The team is super friendly. The man who was servicing the tables was so kind and helpful. He made us feel special and appreciated. Great food, amazing service!"}
{"text":"The customer service was phenomenal j.r was just two of our servers they could not have been nicer just every one was awesome and so sweet it was my wife and I first time there they had no problem going over the menu the food was so good we both got the Italian sandwich and the salad was so fresh I am beyond impressed the food and customer service."}
{"text":"I'd like to start off by saying I love Newks food. I've been to many locations and they are all consistent and yummy! However this review is for the Manager of this location - Brian. I have never had to deal with such a rude and impolite employee at any restaurant location. He was inhospitable, rude, and overall demeaning. I will never frequent this location again specifically because of this individual."}
{"text":"Newk's is amazing. They bake their own bread fresh daily and it's so good. I consider myself a chicken salad connoisseur...and Newk's is my #1 choice for chicken salad. Nothing compares!   This time I ordered the five cheese mac n cheese as my side ($2.75 upcharge), which was just okay. Next time I'll just stick with a regular side, such as chips, fruit cup, or pasta salad.   Tips: The chicken salad sandwich normally comes on the 11 grain bread, which is not nearly as good as the Parisian White - so I always substitute for white. I also always ditch the Spicy creole mustard. Then the sandwich is perfection.   I deducted one star because the service here is hit or miss - I have had to wait for 20plus minutes before for my to-go lunch. Nothing though will stop me from incorporating their chicken salad in my life though on at least a monthly basis!"}
{"text":"I just want to express how appreciative I am of the staff at Newk's. They have good quality food, but what makes the place stand out is how the employees handle the small things that come along with being popular/swamped during lunch hours uptown. The lady at the online order desk was very quick to bring me my chips missing from the bag, and RJ (JR?) waited on us when we decided to eat in with our online orders. There were spills and a plate that shattered but everything was taken cared of in a flash. Their work ethic humbles all of us!  P.S. The Newk's Q sandwich I had today was delicious."}
{"text":"Great food, delivered to your table hot and fresh. Great customer service from the dining room attendant. Reasonably priced lunch options; however, certain soups are only available on certain days!"}
{"text":"This location is good for lunch. Can get pretty crowded and wait is long, so it's best to come before noon or after 1pm. If in a hurry, order online or by phone in advance. The food is made fresh to order and you can see your food being made in their open kitchen. Just be sure to check your order prior to leaving for accuracy.  Menu consists of soup, salads, sandwiches and pizzas. Kids options are available."}
{"text":"If you want a taste of the friendly south, this is the place. I'm not just talking about the food. I want to give accolades to the exuberant employee, J.R. A native New Orleans resident went over the top to make us feel welcome. He introduced us to fire and ice pickles and a delectable mustard.  We had the lobster bisque and the avocado turkey sandwich -- on the half and half option part of the menu. The food was good. My opinion was the bread was toasted about 10 seconds too long. But it was very filling and tasty."}
