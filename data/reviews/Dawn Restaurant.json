{"text":"Food tastes fine.  Nothing exceptional.  You won't hate it but you also won't come back.  If you are craving breakfast food this place will not satisfy you.  If you are just looking to try something different in your local neighborhood and don't have high expectations this works."}
{"text":"Awful experience.  Horrible service.  Food was cold.  Rude staff. Took over an hour to get my food. Had to chase staff down for a coffee refill.    You're better off going to sunset grill.   Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place.  With all the competition out there, I don't see them lasting very long either."}
{"text":"Good service, full menu, and ample servings. A nice place to grab a bite with the family."}
{"text":"I must say I was quite impressed with my whole experience here and would definitely recommend it, and come back again.   I ordered the hungry man breakfast for myself, 3 eggs, bacon or sausage, toast, home fries, and pancakes or French toast. I had it with French toast and bacon. I had an order of children's pancakes for my kids, they came in an order of 3. I gave the kids each a pancake and a French toast and left a pancake for myself. The portions were pretty big and the pancakes were fantastic, I'm not usually a fan of pancakes, but these were particularly tasty. The bacon was nice and crispy, there were 4 pieces, the home fries were very salty, but cooked well. I wish there was a bit more eggs, but I came out full nonetheless.   The service was quick and friendly and all requests were handled promptly, although it wasn't all that busy when we visited. I was pleased and hope to be back again."}
{"text":"I realized that I was being far too harsh on Dawn. While I have a few criticisms of the place, we seem to gravitate towards this restaurant when thinking of places to go for breakfast...so it can't be all bad. Perhaps because I've been there about 20 times,  I expect much more than other less frequented places. Anyways, the food is always great. We've run the gambit of breakfast items...from bacon/eggs, to waffles, to French toast, to their breakfast poutine (which sounds gross on paper but my 12 year old niece loved it! LOVED IT), to fruit, to grilled cheese. All have been excellent. The staff are more on the ball and they frequently drop by to refresh coffee and tea."}
