{"text":"This place is a restaurant? It smells like they have a cat and it peed all over the place. The food is ok maybe. Their plates were disgusting it was like they did not even clean them. Their clams and mussels were scary. The shrimp scampi was even fishy. It is probably warmer in the north pole then in this restaurant we are keeping warm by 5 candles. They have not turned on the heater and we are in a private room and it us STILL cold. Im here on a Christmas dinner and I do not want to be rude to the hostess because of her kindness. But this restaurant is NOT a good place to come. Bill came to $600!"}

Ok I ll explain you why I am saying food was ok , nothing crazy , nothing like they show in the web site anyway .
When I had to pay the bill I gave my MasterCard to the owner Salvatore and the they after while I was having lunch I take a look at my bank account and I see there are 2 charges at OSTERIA Antichi Sapori , one for the actual meal we had nd the second one for a total amount of 1055 usd . . . .  I immediately called the owner Salvatore and he confirmed me that he didn t swipe my credit card twice but it is probably an error of his bank . . . . Error OF HIS BANK .? I told him that banks do not swipe crit cards in restaurants BUT ppl who works in restaurant does . . . .  It was to all to someone who does not live on planet earth . . . He told me he wd call me back in one week 10 days. . YEA RIGHT ,!!,!!  I called immediately my bank and they confirmed that the transaction were made in ANTICHI SAPORI RESTAURANT in Montreal . 

Well I called him back and explained what my bank told me and OF COURSE he didn't get it again. . . .  
I asked him to send me copy of the first transaction and he told me that he already sent out all the receipts to the accountant ( BULSHIT ) and he also told me that he can not check on his system if he billed a total amount of 1055 $ ( SECOND BULSHIT BC IT IS POSSIBLE ) 

Anyway these guys at this restaurant are not honest people at all , and I just regret to didn' read the review before mine on yelp. . .

So I am not one for writing bad reviews.  I always try to enjoy myself when I go out.  The only time I leave upset is when I feel ripped off.  Some restaurants do a great job in overcharging. My experience @ Restaurant Osteria Antichi Sapori at 1228 Bishop, Montreal was shocking, yes SHOKING. I actually asked the owner to call the police because they were so unreasonable.
Their food looks nothing like the website http://www.osteriaantichisapori.com/.  I can't stand when restaurants do special dishes for photos on their website.  Customers can totally tell.  So if you are one of those restaurants shame on you. 
First off the food was ok, just ok. They were out of a few items on the menu that we wanted like arugula & clams.  The owner said that they could do a mussel dish instead of clams.  So I agreed. 
Our appetizers were a bit pricey I thought.  We got 2 pieces of grilled calamari for $15.  Maybe that is the going price here in Montreal, not sure.  But by NY standards that is expensive. One thing that everyone knows is that clams are more expensive than mussels.  In fact, clams are 3-4 times the price of mussels.  Restaurants like mussels because they are a high profit item.  So I would have expected not to pay the same price for the mussels as the clams. So all I did was ask when I paid my bill if that was the correct price.  At this point I am not upset, but just asking.  Restaurants can make mistakes on bills, it happens.  So I asked a simple question if that was the correct price, I was not complaining. Both owners immediately told that is the price and then asked me what my point is.  Yes I was asked what is my point.  So I asked aren't clams much more expensive. They never gave me answer.  Then I asked how many clams I would have gotten if they had clams.  They told me 6.  So I asked isn't it odd that you charge the same price for mussels & clams? This is when it escalated.  I was told they don't have time for me and they are busy.  Busy... there was 1 other table in the whole place.  And there was only 1 other table when we got there.  This place was not busy & now I know why.  Actually, the wife was sitting at the bar when my wife got the bill from inside drinking.  Both owners got very rude to me about their prices.  All I did was ask if the check was correct because aren't mussels much cheaper. Then I told them specific prices of the 2 because I own a restaurant and I would never charge the same price for both. They started laughing at me & of course it escalated.  I told them I was glad to pay as she is running my credit card. In fact she swiped my credit card 4 times, not sure why.  The third time I put my tip, which I did not want to tip at all, in the credit card machine.  She did not like my tip so she cancelled the transaction & threatened to call the cops because I did not want to pay.  So she actually called the cops and told them I was not paying my bill.  I am in the background saying your not taking my money.  So she swiped my card for the 4th time & I left a .25 tip on $78.  They flipped out on me in front my kids.  I then took my iPhone out to record this women being rude to me.  She then decides to lock me in the restaurant. My kids get pushed outside & my wife & I are inside.  She is forcing the door closed on us.  At this point I have to pull the door open if I want to leave.  
It seems that this restaurant is struggling for business.  When people are hurting for money they will do what ever it takes to get an extra dollar.  In this case it was a bait and switch.  I knew of the switch.  It's like a Cadillac vs a Chevrolet.  Mussels and clams are not the same price. They only thing they said in their defense is but you ordered the pasta. Pasta, it was literally 4 bites worth.  The bottom line is that for a couple extra bucks in their pocket they were willing to send away a very unhappy customer. If they would have said something like I'm sorry let me take $2 off each dish the whole situation would have been different.  But these owners are not about a culture of making the customer leaving happy.  My wife said to me \"but we are tourists and they know that. They won't see us again as if there is nothing that we could have done.\"  That is where restaurants are wrong.  Now w/ review sites like Yelp, Trip Advisor etc it will be hard to get good reviews.  These restaurant owners obviously don't understand the internet.  There was one review on Yelp that we should have read 1st.
I hope an extra $4 was worth it to these people to send me off very upset.  A lousy $4 is all it would have taken. It not even about the money.  It's that they argued right from the beginning and never answered my question about clams being 4x the price than mussels.  It was just don't tell us how to run our business.  Ah excuse me I am the customer and I am making an observation & asking.  That's all folks, just asking."}
