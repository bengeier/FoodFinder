{"text":"The Corral Room is perhaps downtown Madison's best kept secret. It's cocktail lounge beneath the Tornado Room that only opens after 9pm. The menu is mostly small plates and drinks. The lighting is intimate and the decor relies heavily on dark corners and draped curtains. The place simply oozes atmosphere and looks like something straight out of a David Lynch movie. It's hard to categorize the Corral Room Bar. It straddles the line of both divy and classy. Both seedy and romantic. If you're on a date and you REALLY want to impress someone, take them to the Corral Room.  

P.S. I'm pretty sure this is the only place in madison where you can order escargot."}
{"text":"I love this little bar area in the Tornado Room.  This place has a great feel, very intimate and romantic.  Wonderful place to hang out or wait for a table.  They have great bar tenders and table service."}
{"text":"This is no Tornado room...but, it's kitchy and if you're in absolutely no hurry and in the mood to fight for a table and have a small party, what the hell. Give it a try. 

We ordered the French onion soup, cheese curds (not available on the upstairs menu), scallop appetizer, steak sandwich and the pineapple upside down cake (also not listed on the late night menu but on the upstairs Tornado room menu). 

Pros: 
We could get quality cheese curds that weren't normally an option here! They had many of the fav's from the upstairs menu available as a late night late night option. The dessert was amazing, as always! 

Con:
The steak sandwich had been rumored to be a showstopper but ours was thin pieces of tough, chewy steak. Nothing close to what I'd have ever guessed possible for this usually elite steak house on even its worst day. Major disappointment."}
