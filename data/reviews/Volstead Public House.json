{"text":"Good vegan food and drinks!! Coffee or alcohol, how can you go wrong!"}
{"text":"I really like this place, they have sandwiches which are very good, they just introduced a breakfast menu which I'm excited to try. Its close to home so I'm here all the time to study and the staff are so friendly, I also love that they have a latte of the day."}
{"text":"This place is so cool, you walk inside and feel cozy. They have an amazing selection of drinks and vegan food! The only con I would have to include would probably be the time it takes for you to actually get what you order. I've been going there for often for a while now and whenever I order even just a drink it takes no shorter than like 8 minutes. So definitely not a Starbucks lol. This place is cool if you need a quiet place to do work and have a drink and a bagel."}
{"text":"Love the lavender toddy! Also really good chai here.... Love the vegan options here.... Love the vibe here!  Ordered the squawker Texas ranger sandwich (vegan buffalo chicken sandwich with arugala on top of a rustic crunchy bread ) with a side of sweet potatoes and black bean salad....all delicious!!!  Service was a tad slow but the gave us $1.00 off cards for our next visit.....   Will definitely be back...."}
{"text":"Like any restaurant there are strengths & weaknesses. The sandwiches are made on a press and my vegan Philly was good and easily can be better with just a bit more veggies. Also, their coffee drinks seem to be good.  However, finding a clean table was a bit of a challenge. Overall, cleanliness is a big challenge for this place. The community water jug wasn't flowing so I opened it hoping it was fruit or something, I was surprised to see hair inside the jug & what looked like pieces of napkin in it.  Personally, I don't think that is sanitary.   What's worse when I let the person working there know she first just made sure there was water in the container and it doesn't appear to get checked in the inside. When I let her know what was inside she took the water away, but it was not replaced and I didn't get to drink any water with my meal.   Since my sandwich was good and the vegan blue cheese dressing was also good (for my side salad) they avoid a 1 star rating from me, but if cleanliness is that big of a challenge it is unsettling to think of the rest of the \"kitchen\""}
{"text":"Place has a nastalgic feel,  love it! Food menu looked great, donuts were amazingly authentic. Coffee was flavorful and smoothe. I recommend the nitro with no sweet, no cream for you plain coffee drinkers. The cocktail menu was enticingly unique, if I were there later in the day I would have indulged. Overall great place, can't wait to come back and try one of those gourmet grilled cheeses."}
{"text":"This hip little coffee shop is perfect for downtown mesa. Awesome drinks! The nitro coffee hits the spot and its about time mesa got some good vegetarian and vegan sandwiches that are healthy as well as delish! This is my favorite spot!!"}
{"text":"Great vegan spot. Not a ton of healthy but a whole lotta flavor and bar type food you may miss from your meat eating days. We had the squaker salad. It was terrific. Not coated in sauce just little diced faux grilled chicken lightly dipped in wing sauce. There was a little vegan ranch drizzled but a cup on side so didn't weigh down the salad. Also ordered the meatball marinara and it was amazing. Sauce was very good and the balls full of Italian flavors. Lastly had the boy blue sandwich with a sweet BBQ sauce. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and everything is good! They have a solid beer selection. Every sandwich I've had has been tasty. Their coffee is quality and they offer handcrafted pastries! Another win for Downtown Mesa!!"}
{"text":"I really want to like it here, the decor is cute and the staff is friendly and helpful. However, a half filled cocktail with a huge chunk of ice leaves a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"I've gone here several times and had mixed experiences.  The first two visits were positive and I was happy with the quality of the drinks.  However, I was disappointed with my list visit.  I ordered a hot chai latte to go only to discover that it was barely lukewarm, at best.  The taste also seemed a bit off- needless to say, I didn't drink much of it.  May wait a while before giving it another try..."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend today and it was delicious & amazing. I have not eaten at a \"wow\" place in a while where every bite was to be savored. Even the drink I had was equally amazing. I got the opal grilled cheese sandwich. Everything served is vegan which I love, although they do have regular cheese if that's the preference. I just tried the vegan, and I cannot get over how good it was. I love a solid grilled cheese place, and this one is close to me so I will definitely come again.  I also tried the \"Pick me up\" drink (good name) which perfectly served it's purpose, that was also excellent.  The design/area was cool and dimly lit. It was a Sat night so you could also hear the show playing next door which I liked as it added to the scene."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to hang out and grab a bite in Downtown Mesa! Great vibe, wonderful staff, vegan food and great coffee and adult beverage choices! Attached to the World Famous Nile Theatre Volstead Public House brings some good vibe to Downtown a Mesa! I love it! Check out their lavender iced coffee or nitro coffee !"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The staff is friendly, the food is great, the coffee is delicious and the cocktails are on point! The decor and whole vibe of the place is wonderful. I'm so excited to find a place in downtown Mesa with vegan grilled cheese! I would highly recommend and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Going here started off partially because of a lack of options/need of variation but also to see if the other reviews were accurate. So far I have visited on a Second Friday (Mesa's monthly art walk), while attending Mesa Maker's Fest, Volstead's karaoke night, and as recently as this past Friday for their \"St. Patty's Day Feast\". As previously stated part of my motivation for going so many times was to see consistency of service.  During my times visiting there was hardly any wait (less than five minutes! seriously!) for my orders or any of the other guests (despite how busy they were!). Cleanliness has been perfect every single time. Everything from the in-house baked goods to the sandwiches (and the crazy awesome St. Pattys Feast!!!!) blew me away.   They have had creative sandwiches and side pairings as well as sweet & savory options for scones, muffins, or bagels. On top of all this the prices are great and the service is even better. A must visit especially if you understand the importance of supporting local businesses and are looking to break away from the monotony of the places you usually eat at."}
{"text":"Coffee is good, the baristas are nice, and the space is beautiful! I just wish they would turn their music down--it was glaringly (I mean super duper) loud at 7:30am, and that is hard to handle when I have an aching hangover!"}
{"text":"2 stars for a very sparse sandwich. I mean real sparse. Basically bread and sauce. Have to try again next time so I can hopefully give a place that serves vegan food a better rating. If I was one of those meat munchers this sandwich sure wouldn't convince me to convert to veganism."}
{"text":"Food was solid and had a nice latte. Chill environment that my kids liked as well. The people were really nice as well."}
{"text":"This is another cool addition to downtown Mesa after the light rail. I've only had a cup of coffee (to go) so far, so all I can say for certain is it's a good place to get coffee on a weekday morning. I'd like to go back to try more of their coffee drinks, especially the lavender toddy."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this coffee/vegan/pub/sandwich shop for the last year and love it. The owners Felisha and Michelle are here pretty much every morning making delicious pastries, prepping for the day and talking Bball which was unexpected and AWESOME!   Even though all of their food is vegan it's not something they make a big deal about. They put half and half in my lavender toddy without batting an eye about it. They have great sandwiches, try the \"toast of the town\" for breakfast or the philly for lunch, I can't believe there's no meat in it.  You may have frequented this establishment at night by coming to one of the local downtown shows Mesa has to offer. They've got a good beer selection with local brews and flagstaff brews which reminds me of home. Thanks for the great mornings!"}
{"text":"Omg yes! It was amazing. Love this place! Will be back again and again. Everything tastes great. I got the blueberry BBQ chicken thing with squash salad. And the cheese was amazing on the cheese and pepper grilled cheese. Very good vegan place! Plus the atmosphere is nice too  Edit: only problem is they never seem to be open... went back many times and they are always closed...."}
{"text":"Hands down best waffles (regular or vegan) I've ever had. You didn't really need syrup and they were super filling. The mock chicken was pretty good and the dish came with syrup and hot sauce, so options. Didn't realize that this is an all vegan place besides a few dairy addition options. I walked in trying to figure out what to order. I asked what was vegan and when they said everything I lit up and did a happy dance  They have a great brunch menu Saturday mornings. I've only tried brunch options so far but their whole menu sounds great. So far tried a strawberry scone which they wrapped up beautifully like a little present and chicken and waffles both were delicious. The chicken and waffles looked so fancy and had a mango slice on the side. A+ on presentation. I want to eventually try all five of their brunch options, everything sounds so good! Will be back."}
{"text":"The interior design is cool and warm, and the service was decent enough, but none of that can outweigh truly mediocre coffee, which if you're a coffeehouse, is kind of important."}
{"text":"Coffee is strong and good, the vegan donuts are to die for. Great location, it is attached to the Nile theater, in the heart of downtown Mesa."}
{"text":"One of my new favorite spots! I'm not a huge coffee person but their cold brew nitro is AMAZING!! The staff is so attentive and the customer service is great. The hubby and I both got grilled cheeses and they were delicious! I would definitely recommend the green chili. Can't wait to go back and try more of what they have to offer! The vibe was great we just sat and chilled for a few hours. Some great people watching."}
{"text":"The Philly is awesome!  I wish this place was closer to where I live or work.  Very friendly service."}
{"text":"Very cool and swanky coffee shop! I went in for my first time today and was greeted by beautiful live music & vegan pastry samples I will definitely be visiting this place again and again xx"}
{"text":"Beautiful establishment with delicious food- I was recommend to get the Squawker Texas Ranger... i was not disappointed. Perfect place for vegan options. I look forward to my next trip"}
{"text":"Modest, clean, cozy vibe. The girls who run it are kind and everything on the menu is amazing. I try to grab a coffee every other day and today I got a new card in the mail, I called to activate it and didn't realize it took 24 hours for it to go thru. I ordered a coffee and the card declined, the ladies were nice enough to give me a coffee anyways. I was so embarrassed and they made me feel really grateful to have a local business that really takes care of us downtownees. I'll be stopping by for a coffee tomorrow and give a BIG tip for helping me out!"}
{"text":"First time here.. Tried the vegan philly cheese steak and all I can say, it was DELICIOUS!! The vegan cheese was great and the service as well! Thank you"}
{"text":"I got the iced almond milk latte with carmel and white chocolate flavoring. It was pretty delicious. It is hard to find a decent almond milk latte, and though it wasn't the best it was well worth the trip. The coffee was nice and strong and stood out in the drink, which I love. The flavoring wasn't too over powering. And I am guilty of being one of those people who love a sweet drink, though, I am trying to cut more sugar out of my life so maybe it was a good thing to not have it so sweet, and so with that I tasted the almond milk flavoring more than I would like. But since I am cutting out diary and sugar I better get used to it, and the drink I got at Volstead is something I could enjoy.   In addition, it was empty when we got there at 8:30ish am and so that was nice as well and it was a great setup to do homework or get things done. Plus the music was great. A little bit too loud to have a meeting there, but I am sure they would turn it down if there wasn't too many people there."}
{"text":"Dude was too cool to even acknowledge us.   I wanted to like this place so much, I'd been wanting to try it out, finally made it here on a Sunday (btw, it'd behoove the owners to keep their current hours posted accurately across all forums), but the barista/dude behind the counter, who was the sole employee afaik, was so silent I felt uncomfortable even ordering. Asked for a cup for water and was given a cup...I guess I wait for water?   We ordered the grilled cheese special & SW bagel. SW bagel was awesome- nothing mind blowing, but tasty! My grilled cheese was underwhelming and barely melted cheese.   Biggest takeaway was the uncomfortable feeling from the employee. I work in a similar job, I don't want someone up my ass or being fake or too intrusive-- but this was the extreme opposite. I felt unwelcome."}
{"text":"The volstead public house is a very friendly place to go for a quick bite. All of their sandwiches are vegetarian and can be made with vegan cheese. We got two vegan sandwiches and were very pleased with them. They are a bit small so they're not filling but they were excellent. Also the staff is very friendly. Overall, a nice place to sit and enjoy a cruelty free sandwich."}
{"text":"My sister and I were really excited to try Volstead because it's another of the highly rated spots in downtown Mesa, but I can't say this has been my favorite in the area. It's a cute place, but we weren't crazy about the food.   We went at lunch time and split the Copper State Sandwich, which is vegan cheese, green chilies, and chipotle mayo on sourdough bread. To be honest, I didn't think it was anything special. It was too cheesy for me, with very few green chilies, and I can't say I even noticed the mayo. It is affordable though, we split that with chips and a pickle, which was filling for us both and only about $9 total :)  It is cool that this is a vegan/vegetarian restaurant offering a menu with vegan cheese items and vegan chicken, ham, soyrizo, etc. They do have regular cheese if you'd like though, we found that out while ordering.  Other than that, I did like the atmosphere, though it was a bit dark inside. It's a fun cafe with a lounge area for reading, and I saw a few games as well. If you like to bring your work to cafes, I'd say this is a good spot! It's very quiet and not too crowded, and they have free WiFi."}
{"text":"Delicious vegan and vegetarian options! Their grilled cheese is amazing! Nitro Cold Brew is on tap and it is tasty. I am so excited for this place!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try some vegan food options for a while now, so I was excited to try some of the things they have at Volstead. We got the Copper State sandwich, which is basically a grilled cheese with vegan cheese, green chiles and chipotle mayo. While it wasn't bad at all, it definitely wasn't one of the better sandwiches I've had in a while. It kind of just wasn't anything special in my opinion. I also think they went a little heavy on the cheese and could've used more green chiles.   That said, I do think the restaurant has very reasonably priced food, because you get a big sandwich plus chips and a pickle for a pretty low price :) I would like to try their coffee, but I didn't have any this time. I'm not sure that I'd rush back here, but I'm definitely glad we finally tried it!"}
{"text":"Yum!! This is a gem in Mesa, whether you're a plant-based/vegetarian/vegan foodie or not!  I had the Squawker which is a buffalo \"chicken and mozzarella\" sandwich with a side salad yesterday... So good! And my sometimes soy-sensitive tummy didn't give me any troubles afterwards, which tells me it's quality ingredients.  The chicken substitute was not fried, which I like, and the cheese was some of the best I've had. I'm not a fan of ranch , but I actually found myself dipping my sammy into it a couple times. Good stuff!   Coffee is also quite good. I only added a splash of coconut milk so I was able to enjoy the full flavor of the beans.   The restaurant is clean and adorably vintage in decor, and the ladies that run it are very sweet. There was a brunch special of chicken and waffles that looked amazing (those waffles are huge and fluffy ) I'm aiming to get back out and give that a try next time its on the brunch menu.  Two thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"My husband happenned upon this place using the Happy Cow app and it's def a gem in the middle of Mesa. We've returned multiple time and have plans to make a Sat brunch soon, as the menu looks fantastic. Adorable, cozy environment as well."}
{"text":"On an unusually cool and drizzly day I came in and asked for their ooeyist, gooeyist grilled cheese.  She suggested the Philly.  It was neither ooey or gooey.  The filling had the consistency (at least I think) of cat food.  Okay flavor.  This came with an over $3 partially-filled cup of Earl grey tea.  Expensive meh.    However, I will note that the sourdough bread was wonderful!  Oh, and I did not get chips or a pickle as I am seeing on the other pics."}
{"text":"I am not in Mesa often, but I will always make a point to stop in to Volstead! I had to be in the area for a work errand and stopped in to grab a cup of joe. I was treated to one of the best cups of coffee I have ever had! I have since tried the food, and honestly wish I was in the area more often, excellent! I will volunteer for any more work errands to Mesa for more chances to stop in, thank you Volstead!"}
{"text":"I like this place came here while waiting for a concert. Good chai and it's not super packed with hipsters like most coffee places."}
{"text":"I've previously gone to this place and it has been very good but I went today with the family and the drinks were tasteless and mildly cold. My tea latte was bland and did not originally have steamed milk in it (duh that's what a latte is!) My husbands chai tasted like hot water and my kids hot cocoa was just steamed milk with a dribble of cocoa. Very disappointing! Clearly the women working totally did not give a darn because when I asked for milk in my latte she didn't even bother to steam it. She just poured it in from the fridge. We won't be back. One bad drink I could handle. But 4? Come on people! Get it together!"}
{"text":"The baked goods from Lo-Fi were better and I miss having the guitar to play while I waited for my drinks and food. I definitely miss them now that Volstead is in it's place. That said, Volstead has some amazing grilled cheese sandwiches and creative drinks. It's now a great place to go for lunch instead of just morning coffee."}
{"text":"I work in the area so I come to Volstead often and I am grateful for a place to have meetings and grab a bite that impresses every time. The atmosphere itself is cool and comfortable, especially on that rare Arizona rainy day. Volstead has that classic coffee shop feel with a bit of that trendy vibe added in.   Their coffee is on point and definitely will pick you up. I get the house-made toddy, sometimes regular, sometimes lavender. Yum! The food is all vegan and it definitely doesn't taste like it. It's amazing. They do a great job of making what should taste like nothing, taste delicious. I'm not a vegan so I don't go out of my way to find vegan joints, but I really do enjoy all of their sandwich options immensely, especially the Squaker Texas Ranger. They even offer a unique selection of cocktails and craft brews and ciders.   The place is clean and friendly. All of their staff is really nice. The bathrooms are always clean and stocked which is a huge deal to me.   All in all, it's one of my favorite places to go to meet a colleague or a friend or just grab a bite."}
{"text":"Although the service was incredibly TERRIBLE, the food was amazing, so didn't want my review to reflect the poor service. Hopefully the Manager or Owner will have some training so patrons are greeted, and not treated like they are an inconvenience. It was every person during our visit, so maybe she was just having an awful day? Anyway, food was AMAZING, and definitely worth a try to satisfy your Vegan palate. It should be noted I am NOT vegan or vegetarian, but visited with my BFF (who is), and we both loved the sandwiches we shared. Philly cheese steak & fried chicken sandwich with incredibly tasty blueberry BBQ sauce. Yum!!"}
{"text":"Vegan yummy heaven, great place to take kids for a treat and not feel guilty. Very happy to support!"}
{"text":"I finally got to try this place recently. The food was delicious! And the ambience of the place was really cool. Unfortunately, we won't be coming back here. The man at the counter told us there are no high chairs, which makes it close to impossible for us to enjoy a meal with our small children. Definitely had to knock off a star for that. I'm surprised such a casual restaurant wouldn't be accommodating to families."}
{"text":"Glad to see downtown revitalized! This place is great inside & has good coffee. A nice place to relax & I hope it stays around."}
{"text":"Great little coffee house a real coffee house. Fresh brewed coffee in a cup and saucer if staying. Nothing like coffee in a big cup with saucer on the bottom, but that's just my opinion.  Visited Volstead when I first arrived in  Arizona.  They have some new additions like waffle sandwiches which looked delicious. Someone ordered a buffalo chicken waffle sandwich and it was brought out, but no one claimed it. I told the server she could leave it on our table so that it wouldn't go to waste. Urrrrr she wasn't having it, oh well I tried. Scone was had by a friend and enjoyed.  My coffee was great, it was a good second visit."}
{"text":"The guys there are awesome, the owners seem annoyed every time I order something. Not sure if they are stressed or what, but I sometimes feel sheepish to order something.   WIFI IS TERRIBLE. NEVER RELIABLE.   When I ask about it they just tell me to try it again or they say \"sorry\" and that's it. Sad because I always order while I'm here.   Needs life and energy, and a reliable wifi source."}
{"text":"I'm not even vegan and I enjoyed the Philly sandwich. They have a great variety and friendly staff. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with this little shop. It's so inviting; a wonderful place to meet with friends for some of their fabulous cocktails. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"It was a very nice cafe with some interesting vegetarian options. I'm an omnivore and liked the soyrizo breakfast bagel and coffee. They did have dairy for the coffee upon request.  If you have to have meat you may want to eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"We made several attempts to come here,  only managed to actually come once. The hours aren't accurate on yelp or maybe they vary. When we finally had a chance to check it out it was underwhelming and slightly uncomfortable. We were really wanting to find a coffee shop we could frequent and volstead was close and seemed really cool but I doubt we'd be back. We walked in and contemplated the menu...asked what a toddy was and was very put off by the response... like we were dumb for not knowing...the cashier/barista wasn't very welcoming and didn't seem to want us there...we persisted...or tried...we waited for our coffee and tea, sat down in the couched area but left soon after we got our drinks. Never a word from the cashier/barista. The space seemed nice enough, imagine it could be comfortable, just not this time, not for us. The coffee wasn't spectacular, not good enough to brace the awkwardness."}
{"text":"Since collaborating with the Nile theater, people might be confused with the location of the coffee shop/restaurant but it's not too bad. The food itself is very good a little bit on the pricey side though. The environment is very vintage and stylish. Their coffee menu is also splendid."}
{"text":"The service honestly wasn't very friendly the day I went, but it wasn't horrible either. I got the buffalo chicken salad, and it was just ok. Could have benefited from some more veggies, or something to make it a little more filling. Overall it isn't a place I would drive out of my way to come to again."}
{"text":"Chill vibe.  Delicious food!  I'm going there right now.  The Squawker Texas Ranger sandwich is legit!"}
{"text":"I come here quite often, but after this experience I may not be coming back. This place doesn't have the best customer service, but it is usually okay. I support veganism and local so this is why I come here. There were about 4 customers in the building today so it was not really busy and 2 women working. I looked over the menu and was ready to order and stood there waiting I was the only person in line. The women working didn't even look at me or say, \"we will be right with you\" so I waited some more still no acknowledgement. I walked out. Don't think I will be back. Food and drinks are decent but not worth that treatment. Those employees should be fired!"}
{"text":"This is the best place ever!! Great coffee drinks! Tasty food and specials! Oh Lord and the baked goods are amazing. I love the atmosphere here and the food is great too. Everything is Vegan which is another win!! Did I mention they do bar drinks at night?! Go to here!"}
{"text":"The muffin I got was amazing as was the coffee. Cute little shop. They had fast friendly service. I'll admit that I went there because I wanted to support a lady-owned business. :) I am excited to try their other food and will definitely recommend to coworkers looking for a lunch spot or morning coffee stop."}
{"text":"Relaxed atmosphere and beautiful decorations. Food is just too good not to keep trying all the menu items. Their coffee is superb, only time I'll ever buy a large coffee. Baristas are so sweet and it's quickly becoming one of my favorite coffee spots."}
{"text":"First visit today and probably won't be back.  Friend and I planned to grab some coffees here and then head over to another eatery for our meals.  I arrived a few minutes before she did as her previous appointment ran late.  No worries, since I wanted to ask my usual questions re food allergies.  Told lone female barista it was my first time here and asked if there were more food offerings besides what I saw in the dessert case, and she said yes and said there were more on menus as she pointed to the small menu sheets next to the cash register.  My eyes gravitated to another mini-blackboard menu titled Seasonal items, and I  instantly wanted to know more about the \"Dreamsicle- Mango Cheesecake\" selection.  I added that I'd like to hear more about these seasonal items, especially that Mango Cheesecake, and she told me \"Oh, they're just something we do here... We serve other items that you find in other coffee shops...\"  Hmm...  She didn't seem enthusiastic about them.  I was still curious about what mango cheesecake coffee would taste like, so I asked her what goes into the drink to make it taste like the dessert, to which she responded that the flavors come from the syrups they use... And I looked towards where she turned her head to, and I saw a wall of Torani syrups.  No gusto, no enthusiasm regarding this delicious-sounding drink, so I stopped considering to get one, told her I was waiting for a friend, and took a food menu to read at a table nearby.  I went back after a few minutes of studying the menu to ask about the breads used for their \"Sourdough Toast & Jam\" and the Copper State sandwich.  Both are made with sourdough bread from a shop \"that starts with an \"M,\" so I volunteered \"MJ?,\" and she said \"yes!\"  Volstead (or is it The Nile now, since the coffee cups have \"The Nile\" printed on them) uses two types of MJ bread- sourdough and multi-grain, and while she didn't have ingredients lists, she thought that the sourdough wouldn't contain any corn in it.  (Allergy.)  The barista also checked and told me that the boysenberry jam did not contain cornstarch.  I sat back down again, and as I waited for friend to arrive, I checked-in on Yelp.  Friend arrived, and after our greetings, I placed my order.  (I think I may have asked friend if she needed some time to study the menu and she said no...?  Otherwise, I'd have waited.)  A cappuccino with 2% milk- I previously asked if the milk came from a local dairy, and she said \"just primarily Silk and milk you'd find at the grocery store...\"- and \"Toast & jam,\" please.  Paid for my order and stepped aside for friend to put in her order.  She asked the barista about the Mango Cheesecake, and the barista gushed about how she loves to craft these drinks on the seasonal menu and that coworkers actually would tease about how she enjoyed making them.  WTH?  Why tell me one thing and feign no interest in the drinks and then speak and act another way to someone else?  I actually said these words to friend in front of the barista, who pretended she couldn't hear me, and friend laughed a little.  OK...  Cup of cappuccino felt half-empty in its small cup when I lifted it from the counter (I decided not to even bother complaining about this), and I had to ask for butter and wait for it while she finished making a third customer's beverage, even though the toast mentioned butter in its description.  Atmosphere was nice (gothic meets hipster), but I didn't appreciate how barista didn't seem too enthusiastic about talking about the Mango cheesecake iced coffee despite my interest in hearing more about it.  I walked in excited about trying a new coffee shop, which I drove for 28 minutes to get to, only to have the barista downsell a seasonal menu to me, while being completely smitten about it to my friend.    Wish the owners good luck with Volstead/The Nile.  You're going to need it with employees that steer people away from something they were interested in trying, apparently as their moods strike them."}
{"text":"It's so nice to see a vegan place in downtown Mesa, but they need to be consistent with their schedule. I stopped by yesterday afternoon, and the store was not open. The Yelp app showed that they were open till 8 pm, but they weren't, so I ended up going to Worth Take Out instead. It was too bad because they have good food here. I've had the Boy Blue Vegan Fried Chicken at Volstead with blueberry BBQ sauce, cole slaw, and cheese in a potato bun, and was looking forward to trying the other items. The menu seems to change also, so be sure to check out their online menu to see what they are serving that day.   Closest Light Rail Stop: Country Club & Main Street"}
{"text":"Vegan grilled cheese sandwiches? Sure, I'll try anything! I've actually been trying to cut down on my meat intake anyways and decided to try Volstead out. The name is interesting, it brings to mind similar sounding names with \"Vol\" in the title. If I am in a silly mood perhaps I will eat at Volstead while listening to Volbeat after test driving a Volkswagon one of these days!  I tried out the Copper State sandwich and a regular size iced latte with coconut milk. The sandwich comes with a side- I went with the kale and cranberry salad. The sandwich was excellent. The bread was lightly toasted and provided a lovely textural crunch with the soft gooey cheese and diced green chiles. The flavors were a perfect complement to each other. The salad was fresh, but underdressed and thus a bit bland to me.   The latte was smooth and rich, with a chocolaty undertone.   Service was swift and friendly.  If I'm in the mood for sandwiches and coffee in downtown Mesa, this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! Amazing coffee and probably the best grilled cheese sandwich I've ever had, and that includes grandma's. The owners are amazing, and the staff on top of it! Can't wait to return!!!"}
{"text":"I just had the very best toasted bagel sandwich that I can recall.  And it was vegan!!! It's called the Copper State Bagel Sandwich. Friendly service and a good location in downtown Mesa!! I'll be back."}
{"text":"Staff is rude. Pastries are so dry and hard they may have been sitting there for days. They use daiya cheese slices and yves vegan ham. Disappointed that I paid so much for the exact food I have at home. The only originality was the bread. I also shouldn't have to pay that much for one tiny scoop of ice cream."}
{"text":"So glad to see this type of place on main in downtown Mesa! Food was great (we had non vegan options). Staff is super friendly. Also had a cocktail, which was delicious, but pricey for its size (super tiny with a lot of ice) and the plastic cup in which it came. Would definitely come back, but not for the cocktails."}
{"text":"This place definitely has a new, cool vibe and I can easily see how it would be popular before a show.  - But if you want a hipster, posh atmosphere; complete with a lackadaisical attitude, this is definitely a spot for you. We came in on a Sunday at 1:00 in the afternoon. One person sitting down and one waiting on their drink. We weren't greeted for 13 minutes. That's after I timed it.  - After finally getting a \"hey\" I asked how the guy was doing. \"Busy\" was my only reply. So hipster they don't even want you here! - Who knows people? Give this place a try if you want something new, it definitely has a good vibe and cool scenery. Just not great on the service."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and plan to return. The staff has always been friendly, and the coffee drinks and grilled cheese excellent. They also have wifi.  There are a couple things they need to improve: * They don't clean tables after a customer leaves. The tables are always full of crumbs or sticky. * They don't do a good job of cleaning the stuff on the side table, like the water container. * They take a long time to make a drink. I appreciate the fresh grinding, but unless no one else in line, getting a drink becomes a time commitment.  I recommend Volstead to my vegan and vegetarian friends, since they'll like the food options. For other friends, I'd suggest going somewhere where they can find a clean table."}
{"text":"Calm,  relaxing vibe.  Picture brick wall with hard wood floors-music playing in the background. I got a Chai tea latte with soy milk (they also have almond milk),  the hubby got an iced coffee and wilber( everything bagel with ham/cheese(vegan cheese available)!  Everything was tasty!  Staff was helpful and very nice.  We will be back! I noticed they sell canned beer as well."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good! Very cute location. Perfect for visiting all the local shops nearby. Food and coffee was delicious. We had a grilled (Diaya) cheese and Philly. I loved the atmosphere - it was similar to Cornish Pasty.   Service was fine. Not very impressive."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and great selection for vegetarians, but I was a bit disappointed by the sandwich I ordered.  Salad was great though!"}
{"text":"Everything looked good but was just very bland..The iced tea was very good but if you are looking for any kind of non surger sweetener you'll need to bring your own, they don't offer it.."}
{"text":"A coffee house vegan place with alcohol. Seems like a neat place to hang out and play board games - there are a few couches and long tables, and the decor is interesting.   Their menu is pretty small, with a few sandwiches and salads, and they have a breakfast menu until 11. Their sandwiches all have the same bread, cheese, so they're a bit one note. The grilled cheese was fine but not super gooey and the bread was fairly crisp. I also got a side salad, though you can also get chips and a sweet pickle.  You order at the counter and then the food is brought out to you. They brought out the sandwiches one by one and there were long lags in between which was quite disappointing.   This isn't really the eye-opening place that will convert nonvegans to vegans but it was okay. Faster, sweeter service and more unique foods would improve this spot."}
{"text":"Our visit to Volstead was nothing less than stellar. We randomly came here out of curiosity and I must say, we will be back. I had an apple fritter (vegan) that was second to none, my boyfriend had a perfect grilled cheese (also vegan) and the employees are very personable. You can get dairy alternatives but upon request which is a first for me, the only unfortunate thing is that there are only 5 stars available."}
{"text":"This coffee shop has great coffee, but more importantly, if you want a coffee shop with some buzz but not quite the noise level of Sip, Cartel, or other highly frequented coffee shops in the area, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Had the iced chai and an americano with white chocolate. They had multiple choices for alternative milk...I had the chai with almond milk. The chai was perfectly sweetened...not too sweet thankfully. The only thing it could've been stronger in was the chai. It was more creamy and milky than anything. The americano was good. They offer quite a few things on their breakfasts and lunch menu. I also noticed their pastries, all of which were labeled vegan. They also offer day old pastries for $1. I didn't get a chance to try the food, but would love to come back one day for it!"}
{"text":"This little gem totally caught my eye as I drove down main street one day for lunch. I wish this establishment was transported to central phoenix so that I could take advantage of it more! They have cute classic sodas (peach is delish) , coffee, grilled cheese sandwiches, and the ambience is wonderful. I went in the early afternoon and it seemed to be the perfect spot to go and get some work done or have a meeting. They have wifi and plenty of seating. Decor is on point beautiful and the place just feels very warm and inviting. Will definitely return when I'm in the area next."}
{"text":"My husband had their regular toddy and I had the lavender toddy both were delicious. The breakfast sandwich was good. I was surprised by the vegan options and wished there had been some more real meat options on the menu."}
{"text":"A great spot on the emerging Mesa Main Street thoroughfare. I had an interpretation of a Chicago Dog. The dog itself was outstanding. They make their pickles! High quality foods and cold nitro brew on tap.  Friendly staff. Word has it a nano brewery will open 3 doors down further enhancing this revitalized neighborhood. All hail public transit, it's having a profound effect on Phoenix and the surrounding cities like Mesa.  Lots of other good food items, too. Whole takeaway rotisserie chickens. Fair prices!"}
{"text":"Two notes about this review: 1) I wavered between 2 and 3 stars. 2) I didn't try any food.  Coffeeshops are the lifeblood of a city. Mesa as a city has been floundering for some time, but recently, has tried to revitalize. This coffeeshop is representative of this.   What I look for in a coffeeshop is: a comfortable workspace, pleasant service, and good coffee. I didn't find what I was looking for in Volstead.    Ambiance: I didn't like being there. With the huge open area filled with tables, smaller intimate tables near the front window, and the side bench table, there's no lack of space. However, it's dark. The lighting, apart from the area near the front windows, was too dim. You could tell that the patrons who walked preferred the front of the business. In fact, of the 5+ people I notice walk in, all sat at the same 2-3 tables.   The decorations are strange. I'm not sure what theme they're going for, but I wouldn't have been surprised if I saw the Adams Family sitting by the defunct fireplace.   Service: Nothing says it better than the 2-star description. Meh. I've experienced better.  I walked in and nobody said a word. I waited in line, and placed my order. It was like talking to a robot. She did offer me a stamp card though, so I appreciated that. I approached the front to put away my dishes: no words from the chatting baristas. I leave: not a single word. I don't expect too much from coffeeshops, but being treated like perhaps they appreciate my business is the minimum.   Coffee: My test for a coffeeshop is a cup of their drip coffee. I ordered a small and carried it back to my table. It wasn't hot. It was warm, but not freshly made hot. It also had this bizarre mouthy feel to it. Now I appreciate when drinks have 'body', but this had no flavour aside from an almost acidic taste. It was strangest cup of coffee I've had in a while. I was wary of each sip, but couldn't throw it out because... student. On the bright side, it still contained caffeine.   I got my work done, and stopped by the bathroom on the way out. It wasn't clean. It was better than a lot of public places, but there were definitely remnants of bodily excrements in the toilet. Perhaps the baristas could take a break from their break and check on their bathroom.   The good: The Parking was probably the best thing about this place. There's street parking all around, and a private lot at the back. It was also quiet, aside from the pop background music."}
{"text":"This place has switched up things a few times since they've opened.  They started with offering a variety of fancy grilled cheese sandwiches. I have never liked cheese, not even vegan cheese, so this option didn't appeal to me.  Then they began offering a sandwich of the month (which had some great features), but soon stopped.  Karaoke Fridays with a special flavor of vegan wings were a thing for a while, and I was really excited for this, but this too was over before I knew it.     Soul Food Saturdays is another thing of the past.  They had fried \"chicken\", greens, and red beans & rice. The fried \"chicken\" is not at all what I expected; it was more like chicken nuggets.  The greens were not southern greens, but they gave it a nice try.  The red beans & rice were pretty decent.   I had a delicious strawberry lemonade cupcake here. It was sweet and very moist.  I never see them advertising cupcakes on their social media pages anymore, so I am not sure what happened.    When I was there on Soul Food Saturday, there was a man singing and playing his guitar live. He had an amazing voice and it was the perfect background accompaniment to my dine-in lunch. I don't know if they still offer this lovely entertainment.   They offer vegan donuts, courtesy of Welcome Chicken & Donuts.  They also offer bagel sandwiches for breakfast, which I have never tried.    The employees were very pleasant, but the owner was unfriendly and cold.   I don't drink coffee, not a bagel fan, and I don't eat cheese, so unfortunately, there is nothing to draw me here any longer."}
{"text":"I have been here a total of two times and found my experiences to be quite pleasant. The food is great and I do enjoy the set up. The prices are also pretty inexpensive and you get a lot of food for what you pay for. My only reason for giving this place four stars is that the first time I went the staff seemed to not care about their job, maybe it was because Friday nights are busy. They barely said anything as I placed my order and went back to my seat. The second time was a great experience though. I will be visiting again!"}
{"text":"A really great coffee shop right downtown Mesa. It's got a really iced relaxed feel, real inviting. I tried a iced chai and an prickly pear lemonade Arnold Palmer, both were delicious. Definitely going to make this place a regular stop!"}
{"text":"Vegan win! I love that everything on the menu is vegan & you don't have to worry about substitutes or asking for anything special. You just order your food & eat it, wow imagine a world... I got the philly cheese steak & I've been dreaming of it ever since. I didn't realize they were closing so soon (5 pm, we got there at 4) I would have loved to be able to linger around & had some more beer or finished with a coffee but we didn't want to be a bother to the sweet waitress. My son had the vegan Mac n chz & omg it was so good he ate the entire bowl! We'll definitely stop whenever we are in the area!"}
{"text":"I really love it here!  Food is super good, they have really great sandwiches.  Can be a little difficult for the gluten sensitive vegan, like my partner, but sometimes we just brave through the sandwiches anyway!  Coffee is really good also.  It is so great to have a vegan place like this one!  Very much appreciated!!"}
