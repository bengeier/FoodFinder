{"text":"We found this place on Yelp, because we were heading to the neighborhood to get baklava at Crown Pastries. This is the first time we had Tanzanian food, and it was awesome!!! It is mostly a takeout place, but there were two tables where you could sit down. The owner was super friendly and really nice to talk to and made great suggestions as we had no idea what each were. We got the grilled platter for three people with enough for a leftover meal for one. Really awesome place, I highly recommend making the trip!!"}
{"text":"1.  Food was EXCELLENT (Had the mixed grill platter and shared it with 2 other hungry people).  Platter included grilled chicken and beef pieces + baby beef ribs + fries + fried cassava ($4 extra).  The platter easily filled our stomachs.  2.  The 4 sauces that accompanied the platter were ADDICTIVE (tamarind sauce, home made mayo, home made (crack) chutney and ketchup).  All so Yummy!  3.  The owner was so hospitable and friendly and the place very clean.  The experience was TOTALLY worth the under 15min wait for the food to arrive STRAIGHT OFF THE GRILL.  We dined in (they have a small seating area for 6 people). Call 15min ahead if you want the food to arrive sooner.  Ps...You MUST try the turkey samosa.  Imagine all the goodness of Christmas turkey dinner stuffed into one golden crunchy samosa - Twas heavenly.  Can't wait to go back!!!!"}
{"text":"The ONLY place you should try for the best BBQ chicken and beef in toronto. Quality food and friendly service. Came here for lunch last week with a friend and both of us went back today for more. Very addictive! Try the short ribs, mogo and mishkaki!"}
{"text":"Just wanted to try something new and different for dinner one night and im glad we came to pili-pili. The beef and chicken mishkakis were tender,  juicy and well marinated. The corn masala was tangy and sweet! Awesome combinations indeed! :)"}
{"text":"Great little spot in Scarborough!  The service is great and they take accountability for any mistakes (forgot to start an order once because they were swamped, understandable).  The food is made with great care and quality consistently - hard to come across these days.  Here are the items I've had so far...  Snacks: Chicken and jerk chicken samosas: made very well, fresh and tender meat. ** they have random samosa promotions, try them out! Mogo: the best fries I've ever had. It also comes with their home made spicy sauce.  Take-out Menu: AAA Beef Ribs: the best ribs I've had in the city. I was skeptical at first but one of the owners encouraged me to try it and now I'm hooked. The meat is soft and it's cooked perfectly. The seasoning is bang on too.  Chicken breast/chicken leg quarter: I'm not a huge fan of the burnt style of cooking. The meat is tender and juicy inside but the skin is usually over-done but I think that's the style of cooking. My colleagues love it, I'd give it 4/5.  Marinated Meats: AAA Beef Ribs: A smaller quantity compared to the take-out menu but same quality ribs. It really is cooked to perfection.  In terms of seating, there's only two tables. It's more of a take-out/catering type business."}
{"text":"Absolutely great food and impeccable service. Their BBQ chicken and beef is done to perfection."}
{"text":"Good for Catering  I had been into Pili Pili a few weeks earlier and really enjoyed the food and friendly service. Loved the food decided to have them cater a small corporate meeting.  The food was a big hit, everything was awesome. I was concerned that the ugali fries would not travel well but no problem they were yummy, and the beef short ribs were AHHH-mazing as per usual. Would definitely use them for events again in the future"}
{"text":"Went there today with a friend for our first time. We ordered their donair and mishkaki roll. Both were good. Looking forward to going back!   Ps try the Mogo. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Another great experience from Pili Pili! Wonderful lunch for our family birthday lunch. Classics did not disappoint - Chicken, ribs, kebabs, mogo, fries, daal! Tried new creations too - cheeseburger samosas were an interesting invention and mixed reviews amongst the older generation but I thought they were great. Pili pili poussin poutine with chicken was ridiculous! So spicy, so cheesy, so saucy, so delicious. Would recommend and would order again for sure. The new chicken pakora was also really tasty and a great starter. Everything is really good and it's hard not to order too much food. Great for lunch leftovers though!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Get the cassava fries. I had the grilled chicken for lunch. Meat was soft and juicy and we'll marinated"}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for some Tanzanian Zanzibar food, look no further than Pili Pili. I've never been to a Tanzanian place before, but I was dragged there and was pleasantly surprised.  They have their version of kebobs, which are not of the middle eastern variety, but rather balls of ground beef deep fried served with an Indian style mint chili sauce.  Also on the platter were mogo (cassava fries), veggie samosas (better than the potato variety).  The highlight of the meal were chicken mishkaki made with chunks of breast meat, marinated in a spicy sauce, and grilled with a nice char flavour to liven up the spices.  To wash it down I had a blackcurrant pop which must be a Zanzibar favourite as well.  This place has a solid list of regulars as I saw a family bring in their own plates for a party they were hosting.  It's good to see a place like this supported by the community."}
{"text":"Oh Scarborough I love it when you remind me why I think you're the best foodie scene in the GTA!   Dear Pili Pili,  Your cassava chips was wonderfully light and flaky to munch on. When it was drizzled with the tamarind chutney and then dipped into with the hot sauce eating it became an experience!   Your poutine has left a lasting impression in my taste buds. The tang in the gravy and chopped beef mishkaki was a great surprise. I love how I didn't have to chew the beef several times because it was deliciously tender. The medium spice gave a kick that didn't overwhelm the taste of the gravy and the meat.  Usually i love my samosas all pastry and the stuffing is usually just meh!Â  But your chicken samosa....what a yummy jam packed meaty goodness. I really tasted the seasoning of the ground chicken and onions. The chicken was the star here. I really enjoyed dipping/drizzling/pouring the coconut chutney all over it since it really brought out all the flavours in the samosa!  Thanks for a great time! I will definitely call you and plan on seeing you again!"}
{"text":"The menu is perfectly suited for anyone who loves BBQ, East African style, with their unique tang of pili pili sauce and well/evenly marinated, soft, juicy meats...you will keep coming back and convince others to come as well,  the way I do!"}
{"text":"Best African style ribs in Toronto! Fresh, tender and excellent marination. Also plan on trying the tiffin service as well where food can be delivered / ordered for dinner (all fresh!).  Great service and like the staff!! Will be back for sure and often :)"}
{"text":"Delicious tender short beef ribs (some pieces did have a bit more fat than preferred) and chicken/beef Mishkaki. Excellent crispy and well seasoned fries and Mogo (cassava). Only once experienced overdone fries. Pili pili mbuzi(hot sauce) tamarind and coleslaw is also very tasty and goes well with the food. If you are a fan of real BBQ food, this is your go to place!"}
{"text":"Great take-out place for the good old Indian 'finger food' like samosas, kabobs, mogo.   Samosas filled generously with meat, not a big pile of grease like other places I've experienced. Mogo is a tad bit too salty, but I think a request can be made to rectify that. Beef kabobs were the best and a must try!"}
{"text":"First time I tried their food was at a wedding that they had catered. We had their beef ribs and cassava which were absolutely fantastic.  There is a ton of flavor on the take-out menu. I recommend you call in your order to save time because they make everything fresh.  This place is my favorite take-out in all of Toronto."}
{"text":"Came in around 6:30pm on Saturday. The man at the counter (the owner?) was super friendly. I told him it was my first time here, and he explained all the difference sauces for me (coconut coriander didn't have a coconut taste, but was quite fresh. Tamarind was good - sweet and slightly tart. Hot sauce was very clean tasting and quite delightful. Not too hot. The coleslaw was slightly tangy, and doesn't have a mayo base. Carrots and cabbage). Had the short ribs and the chicken mishkaki. I can see why the short ribs are their bestseller. They're quite tender. The chicken wasn't as tender as it could have been, but it wasn't super dry either. Nothing particularly distinct about the seasoning. Tasted like standard charcoal BBQ. That being said, THE MOGO. Cassava fries. Fairly chunky fries. I was a tad concerned when I first saw them, but they're super crispy on the outside, and fluffier than fries on the inside. They also don't have a nasty aftertaste like you get sometimes when you eat fries. They're also fresh. They're seasoned with something slightly spicy and slightly addictive. Yeah. The mogo I'll be back for...now if only their their hours were slightly later at night..."}
{"text":"Excellent joint in scarborough. Amazing food and amazing service. If youre at the lawrence and warden area, this is a must-stop joint."}
{"text":"5 stars for excellent food and hospitality. The blend of Indian and African spices speaks for itself. It's a true homage to the rich political history of East Africa. Chutneys come alongside the beautifully grilled meats. Cassava chips are a unique alternative to fries. Toronto is, already, an ethnically diverse culinary city, but this food still manages to stand out. It's not a sit down, just a grab and go. I would love to see it grow into a full blown restaurant.   To the owner, keep doing what you're doing. All the best to you."}
{"text":"Decided to finally try this place after driving passed it everyday for a while. Today on the way home from work, my wife demanded we try it. I'm glad she did! It was delicious. I had the beef mishkaki with cassava fries and it was awesome. Full of flavour and it had bite. I felt like I was eating outside at a barbecue. It had that amazing smokey charcoal taste which I absolutely love. Dip the steak into the hot sauce... Perfect. Shout out to Zuli for the wonderful hospitality. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Great service!!!! Rating 5* for sure.  It was my first time here and had ordered their grill special.  Really like the potatoes & beef short ribs.  The chicken was good & same with the rice but there are better places around the same block.  Food overall rating 3.5*. The amount of food feeds about 2 people $45.00.  I will however, go back for service."}
{"text":"I have never had African food before, so I was interested in checking this place out for the first time. It is primarily a takeout or catering service, but there are two small tables you can sit at to eat. No real plates or cutlery, but the paper boats and plastic cutlery do an adequate job. The cashier/waiter/runner/receptionist was extremely helpful, explaining the different options and even recommending how to switch up our order to get a more diverse experience. We settled on splitting a snack pack and the 1lb of chicken mishkaki between two people.  The snack pack came with samosas, mogos, and kebabs. I am officially a fan of their samosas!! Much better than the ones I've tasted in the past because they didn't use any potatoes as filler. Their vegetables samosas are only stuffed with chunks of sauteed veggies, while their beef ones are stuffed full of meat. The chicken mishkaki was uniquely seasoned, char marked on the outside but tender and moist inside. Each large chunk of meat carried a very smokey flavor that made it extra delicious. Also, there were also three different types of chutneys for us to mix and match with different bites. A great place to be informally introduced to a new cuisine!"}
{"text":"We've gone to this place a dozen times since first finding it because the food is darned good. BUT on our latest visit, we were shortchanged on portion sizes on our takeout order and there was no coleslaw included with our order as promised. Is this the way to treat new regular customers? Get it together, Pili Pili -- dishonesty and ripping off people is guaranteed to lose you a customer any old day. To everyone who frequents this place or wants to try it -- check your order each time to make sure you get what you paid for. Disgusting."}
{"text":"It was very hit and miss but overall I enjoyed the place. Tip: Order ahead so you don't have a wait!  Staff: Super friendly and was nice chatting with them while we waited for our food. Staff earns a star on their own.  Ambience: It's a small place, so it's mostly just a take out or catering spot.  Food: I had ordered Chicken Samosas, Veggie Samosas, Kebabs and the Grill Platter which includes one pound of AAA beef Ribs, one pound of Beef Mishkaki, and two Chicken Leg Quarters, served with Fries and Mogo. I say the best were the Veggie Samosas (filled with so much corn and peas!), the Chicken, and the Mogo which is basically cassava wedges. Dipping them in the Ambli Chutney was just perfect. The Fries and Chicken Samosas were pretty good but nothing too exciting. Unfortunately, the Ribs and the Mishkaki were just not that impressive for me. They seemed overly charred and lacked any discernible flavour.  Pili Pili has definitely intrigued me enough to come back to try more of their menu."}
{"text":"Came here on Friday night, ordered the mixed grill and the snack pack. Just under $60 and we had too much food for 4 people.  + mogo- these cassava wedges are so good, we couldn't stop eating them + short ribs- very flavorful and cooked nicely + beef samosas- filled to the brim, thin pastry layer + kebabs- deep fried! these look like falafels, the meat inside is nicely seasoned and soft - chicken legs- very underwhelming, definitely was not marinated long enough  - mishkaki- so mushy! sitting in an acidic marinade for too long perhaps - our biggest gripe was that everything seemed to have the same seasoning sprinkled over top  Extra star for friendliness- will be back if we are in the area."}
{"text":"I was passing by Scarborough and was looking for a unique place to try. This place came up on Yelp and I was happy to have found it!  I came by with my family on a Friday morning, around 11:20am. It opened twenty minutes ago, so people were setting things up at the back.   Service:  Frendly and attentive   Orders: Chicken Mishkaki + fries + coleslaw salad ($12.50), Chicken Mishkaki + mogo + coleslaw salad ($14.50) and Ugali fries ($5).  It took a very very long time to come out- after 40 minutes.   We never got the Ugali fries that we ordered, but didn't want to wait any longer, so we paid for the two Chicken Mishkaki meals.  We also didn't get the coleslaw salads because they didn't have any. So, the man serving us gave us extra sauces.   Considering we didn't get the Ugali fries and the coleslaw salads, it would've been great to give us other kinds of food (e.g. a samosa, extra fries or mogo) rather than sauces.     Food: The Chicken Mishkaki- spicy, juicy, succulent! Fries- did not like these, they were really dry and some were burnt Mogo- tasted like sweet potatoes! Yum!  For the price, the portion is small. If you have a big appetite, order some sides!     My Verdict:  Check this place out if you are looking for interesting place to try in Scarborough  Waiting time is really long- expect to wait longer than you expect when you visit"}
{"text":"Delicious! Grill platter with mogo was wonderful! The mogo (cassava fries) and beef ribs were to die for. The staff were very friendly and welcoming too. Don't miss this gem!"}
{"text":"Amazing East African Food!  Would highly recommend the Mogo, Mishkaki, and the ribs.  I make sure to visit this place every time I come to Toronto."}
{"text":"Pros: - Unique flavours - Very friendly and helpful service - Mogo was tasty  Cons: - Portion size was relatively small for the price - Some parts of the beef ribs were very salty - Long wait times for food if you don't call ahead - Minimal indoor seating  Ordered: $12.50 Beef ribs with Mogo - The beef ribs were alright for the most part. Mogo was a highlight $12.50 Chicken Mishkaki - Similar to the beef ribs  Conclusion: After driving past Pili Pili a few times and seeing the 5 star reviews, I was excited to visit. Overall, I was somewhat happy with what we got. We ordered the beef ribs and grilled chicken, both with mogo which was recommended to us by the man taking our order. Our food took a little while to come out. We also thought the portion we got for the price of $12.50+tax was a little small. Overall we thought the food was alright. Some bites were very salty and flavours were unique in a good way. Mogo was the highlight. I would recommend Pili Pili to someone looking to try new flavours."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Great value. There chicken kabobs and cassava was so delicious. Definitely recommend. Place doesn't have much of a sitting area to dine in, but great place for take out and catering parties. I spoke to the owner and he was very kind and generous. Great staff amazing food no complaints."}
{"text":"Incredibly tasty food for a very affordable price. If you like spicy food this place is for you. The staff are very warm and friendly and make you feel like family. They were also incredibly generous to provide samples of what they have to offer."}
{"text":"Had the nylon bhajia today which were fantastic, and the Zanzibar mix which brought back fond memories of the island.  The piri piri mogo is also to die for.  Will definately go back and back and back for more."}
{"text":"Pili Pili is my go-to for East African food in the city. If you've never tried East African food before, I highly recommend the mogo (cassava), kebabs, ribs and mishkaki (skewered beef) with their chutney. Pili Pili also sells pre-marinated meats. I always get the beef short ribs in the summer time and grill them on the BBQ at home. If you get the pre-marinated ribs, make sure to get the basting sauce and pili pili dry spice, as it really enhances the flavors (you have to pay a bit extra but it's totally worth it!).   Pro Tip: Make sure to order ahead so you don't have to wait!"}
{"text":"Best $7 I have ever spent on lunch! Chicken Mishkaki Roll was so flavourful that I don't want the taste to go away from my mouth. The portion they serve is also good to fill you up for lunch. I am coming back here again and again and again.  The food takes a little time but that's good because I know it's being made fresh."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. The food is absolutely amazing. Turkey samosas when available are one of the greatest things I've ever eaten. The ribs are just incredible. I live in the west end and am more than willing to make the drive for these ribs. Highly recommended to anyone who likes to bbq ribs.  Get the basting sauce and powder. Takes the ribs to another level. I could keep going but I'm still eating. Took a break to write this review. Great place and great food!"}
