{"text":"Food was amazing. Definitely recommend their high roll ramen from secret lunch menu. I ended up going there again that day for dinner and had the serial killa. It was a great combination of flavor but the rice portion could have been a little bigger."}
{"text":"I have been hearing about this place for quite a while and was really curious to try it - I showed up around 7pm on a Wednesday and was told there would be a 30-minute wait.  Not entirely surprising considering the place is quite small.  We waited across the street at People's Eatery and had some nice cocktails.  The wait turned out to be closer to 45 minutes, but no big deal.

The servers were all very friendly, and we ordered pretty quickly, but the food took a very long time to arrive, and the pace it arrived at was a bit slow for my liking.  The crispy chicken skins were a bit too greasy and served at room temperature (not sure if this was deliberate) and even though it said there was Sriracha salt I couldn't detect anything other than just salt.  The soy sauce eggs and the winter melon soup were good to start with.  The tempura broccoli was very good (particularly with the keffir lime mayo) and the pot stickers were decent.

For mains, we had the traditional soft chicken and the prawns.  The chicken was a really good attempt at traditional Hainanese chicken rice (of which the best I think I've experienced is in Singapore, and what I'm comparing it to).  The hot sauce and garlic sauce were delicious, and I appreciated that they de-boned the chicken since usually the tiny bones just get in the way of the experience, in my view.  The rice was very, very good, and it compares very closely to the best I've had, and the prawns were very good, too.

The price point was in line with any other trendy restaurant like this, but of course it doesn't compare to a traditional Chinese restaurant, but of course that's not what this is.

Was I blown away?  No.  Would I go again?  Likely.  I like that they at least want to experiment with this style of food, which is more than can be said for most joints serving this type of food."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The food is fantastic, and the staff are really friendly.  The decor is adorable, very colourful and bright.  But it really is the food that shines.  I've been here a few times, and I've had the roast chicken every time (I'm not a huge fan of poached chicken), and it's never disappointed me.  The rice is perfectly done, and sauce that comes with the roasted chicken is delicious.  But it's the broccoli that brings me back time and time again.  I cannot get enough of it.  Hands going back, and soon."}
{"text":"The chicken was tender(as any boiled chicken would be) but very bland. Rice was well seasoned and tasty, however certainly not enough to justify the cost."}
{"text":"Interesting fusion restaurant, good food and hip hop playing in the background.

We got the Jackpot chicken, the rice, the cane sugar fried chicken wings, soy sauce eggs, and winter melon soup.
Every dish was tasty but not amazing. 
The Jackpot chicken was very tender but lacked flavor and was way too wet compared to the versions of this dish served in Chinese, Singaporean, Malaysian restaurants. 
The wings were very crunchy and flavorful, but again too wet and seemed over cooked prior to being deep fried.
In general I liked but didn't love the restaurant"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for a while. Dropped in and had appetizers to see what all the hype was about. 
Singapore sling - amazing
Popcorn chicken - salty AF. 
Shrimp toast - Salty AF. 

Took one bite of each and was immediately turned off. Didn't bother ordering the chicken rice for fear of more salt. If it wasn't for our server I'd give this place 1 star. She was very attentive and offered to have them remake our dishes. After we kindly declined she took the dishes off our bill. I may try again. Hopefully it will be seasoned correctly."}
{"text":"I can't stop heating here, I went twice last week, planning to go today! Go on a long ride to flavor town here. Some of the most tender chicken I've had, love the crispy skin add on, and I gotta get the extra rice cause it's addictive!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  My friends raved about it.  I ordered the jackpot chicken.  The flavour of the chicken and the rice were good. The dipping sauces were yummy.  But the texture of the chicken was mushy.  I very much prefer the chicken rice at Phoenix Cafe."}
{"text":"Had the roast chicken. Rice was delicious and chicken was so juicy. Minus two stars for both slow service, and then no service during entire duration of meal."}
{"text":"Couldn't ask for a better dining experience. From start to finish the service and food were fantastic. The manager (Amy) provided the perfect recommendations for us. Her welcoming personality and vivaciousness made a great night just perfect. Our waitress (Sarah) shared the same excitement and quality in service. Our recommendations, try the Singapore Slang cocktail and the Broccoli. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"When you visit the haunted house at Disneyworld, there is a \"butler\" who moves the line forward. \"Fill in the Dead Space\" he says in a flat monotone. This is exactly the way my server said \"The chef apologizes for the Crispy Chicken Skins\".

They could probably align expectations with reality better if instead of \"crispy chicken skins\" they printed \"cold dirty fryer oil\" on the menu.

The rest of the food was OK, aside from the mysteriously extremely spicy braised bok choy, which was also inedible. Our sullen server was mysteriously replaced by a very nice young lady (possibly sent away to have basic customer service skills, or a personality, surgically implanted).

So, I was fully embarrassed on my date by choosing this place to eat. Shout out to Toronto Life Magazine for putting this in the top 20 new restaurants in Toronto for 2017."}
{"text":"We ordered the jackpot chicken, which is really Hainanese chicken rice.  It was alright, but not really authentic to Malaysian or Singporean taste bud.  The rice is a bit wet and soft, missing flavour from pandan leaf.  The chicken, well... no chicken taste so to speak."}
{"text":"The outside appearance has been intriguing me to try it out for some time with all its block colours and pretty font. We visited around 6pm on a weeknight. It wasn't as busy as I expected it to be. The decor is hipster-like and the service was the same, although more on the intimidating laid-back side. The prices surprised me a bit considering we were in Chinatown, but we stayed strong and ordered the Hainanese Jackpot Chicken and Rice for 2 for a total of ~$20 incl. tax. Initially we were each ordering assuming the dish served one, but our server said it was big enough for two. When the food arrived, I appreciated the plating of the chicken and the mini rice-cooker because it made it feel family-style, however the serving was not as large as I thought. As a result, we ate quickly and drank out of the small cups of water. The food tasted really good(!) overall, but I don't think I would come back because it's not my style of eatery."}
{"text":"Service was great and my food arrived within like 5-10 minutes.

The chicken rice was good, and the broccoli tempura was also decent. 

The portion size was pretty small, though it would leave you some room for the dessert, which was also rather small - two strips of french toast. Yes, strips.

With that price, I do hope they could offer a larger portion so you don't have to feed urself with the extras or the desserts.

My final complaint would be that the onion/ginger sauce was a bit dry. The flavour was authentic, it would be perfect if it was more oily."}
{"text":"Very authentic hainan chicken rice. Very juicy tensor chicken leg with a fragrant oil rice. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We had the all-in dinner for two.

The crispy chicken skins and wintermelon soup arrived first, and both were disappointments.  The chicken skins were nicely browned and flat as a crepe.  Sadly, only one edge of the larger piece was crispy.  The rest was soft.  It arrived cold and was borderline rancid.  I've had chicken skin chicharon sitting in my kitchen counter in a paper bag for a couple of days, and they still tasted miles better than this.

The wintermelon soup had two flavourful cubes of wintermelon in a flavourless broth.  It felt like eating stir-fried wintermelon in hot water.  Really.

Jackpot chicken, the restaurant's star attraction, is classic Hainanese chicken.  It was good, but I've had better and it's not good enough for me to come back or recommend to friends.  Let's just say that the only compliment that my friend and I came up with was that it was boneless.  The portion was small, too.

Hainanese chicken rice comes with rice by default, but here, you order the schmaltzy rice separately.  This, they got right.  I did not sense any pandan scent like the menu says, but I do not miss it at all.  It was served warm and moist, with a subtle chicken-ness (from a generous amount of chicken fat, I presume, but don't let that stop you).

I also liked the Thai apple salad with a refreshing lime dressing.  I think there was jicama in there as well, which was nice.

Hamburg 'okonomiyaki' style is a round meatloaf that's dressed up with traditional okonomiyaki toppings -- a tangy okonomiyaki sauce, creamy Kewpie mayonnaise and bonito flakes.  Oh wait, there were no bonito flakes, which was too bad because it would have raised this dish from good to impressive.  Also missing were the nori and pickled ginger that the menu listed.  All in all, I have to say I enjoyed this meatloaf.  I would eat it again.

I'm still confused with the scallop ceviche.  The dish is composed of large cubes of watermelon on a bed of salad greens topped with thin slices of scallop.  Absent is the acidic tang of ceviche.  Watermelon is mostly water so that didn't help with the flavour either.  Edible, for sure, but I could not figure out what the chef wanted me to experience with this dish.

Oh yeah, we also had one soy sauce egg.  Ordered separately, this would have cost $3.50.  For one small-ish egg.  And herein lies one reason why Jackpot Chicken Rice does not work for me.  The food is good, but every item just feels overpriced.  If this meal was Chinatown-priced, I would have it again.  Except for the crispy chicken skin.  And the wintermelon soup."}
{"text":"It's decent food but over priced. Being in Chinatown, there are more reasonable and more delicious options offering the same food . This 'hipster' joint definitely attracts those who may not feel comfortable going to an authentic Chinese restaurant so is a good alternative for those who want Asian food but want an English menu... We ordered three dishes and rice (which wasn't included???), jackpot chicken (Hainan chicken), honey BBQ chicken, and pork neck (was mostly fat and way too chewy)."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of all kinds of Asian food, so when I heard about a Haianese chicken rice place I was curious, so I went with a friend and colleague of mine. I love the visuals - playful floral countertops in different colours, bright colanders dangling from the ceiling as whimsical lanterns, and some low tables and high top tables. It's an intimate space. I know it's the same folks that runs Patois (I impatiently wait for its relaunch) so I figured Jackpot would be a great bet. We shared the Lucky 7 combo (comes with extra chicken) and also an apple slaw, tempura broccoli (YUM - brings to mind the tempura green beans at Patois), clear soup (which I treated as a palate cleanser), and ramen-worthy soft boiled egg which was REALLY good.  The chicken skin was fried extra crispy and salty and tasty. Dessert was a sweet French toast inspired dish with a small coop of coconut ice cream. This was delicious. I also appreciated the classic rock at a volume level that allowed conversation without shouting

Service was friendly and attentive. 

I'd totally come back here! While I enjoy a typical meal in Chinatown, I know not to expect friendly service.  So it's nice to know Jackpot is there for a modern take on traditional Chinese chicken rice with a hipster vibe and great service. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Chicken rice is so so, cocktails were good. These things take a lot of time to make in batches and I guess their low traffic may hurts the freshness a bit.

The window area was quite filthy on my October visit, there were flies all over the window and front door.

Note: It's quite expensive for what and where this is. My star ratings don't really take price into account."}
{"text":"I heard about this place from my sister who have tried the food. There were four in my family and we ordered two types of chickens and a bowl of rice.Within a few minutes, my boys have finished the two plates of chickens and we have to order two additional plates of chickens and more rice. Frankly, the portion is extremely small for $16  a plate.A bowl of rice for two costs $11.Even though the food is not bad, I would never go to this place again.We ended up paying $102. Great food but too highly priced."}
{"text":"This place is great!
We were a party of 4 and had no reservation. We got their early and Amy helped us out. She was attentive and awesome. The food was good too!"}
{"text":"I came from Singapore from exchange, and I have to say that this is one of the most authentic Hainanese chicken rice I've ever tasted. It's almost exactly the same as that I would've had in Singapore. The chicken was tender, and rice was amazingly fragrant. 

The taste was 5 star worth, but the reason why I gave it a 4 star is due to the portions. The price was quite high for the portion, at ~$15 per bowl with tax. 

Overall, I would definitely visit this place again if I wanted to taste my home again."}
{"text":"Best Hainanese Chicken Rice I've had in Toronto.  A little bit pricey, but it's not easy to find Hainanese Chicken Rice in the city."}
{"text":"This place is so good. The decor is fun, the drinks are good and the food is amazing. The chicken with garlic ginger sauce is so comforting. And thinking about the chicken rice makes my mouth water. Everything is well seasoned and really yummy."}
{"text":"Fabulous Asian foods without the traditional inconveniences!  
Jackpot chicken turned out to just be Hoinan Chicken on ginger rice, but the chicken is now de-boned and the ginger sauces are mixed for you.  Food tastes like how I remembered them to be, but alternatives were found for the staple use of fish sauce.  Everything is now novice chopstick friendly-sized.

So I can't call this Pan-Asian really - it's more like Asian food adjusted for a target audience.  Service was great.  The staff sure knows how to up-sell, but this time we didn't mind since they really were great suggestions...they know their menu surprisingly well.  It was very clean inside which is rare for Chinatown experience.  

Definitely worth going back to!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch earlier today with a friend. It's right in the heart of Chinatown. The decor was very hip and colourful. A lot of Asian influences. It reminded me of 1960s China. The service was friendly and quick. We order the hainanese chicken and sambal glazed chicken. Both were delicious, perfectly prepared and presented beautifully. I really enjoyed my meal here. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Greasy, salty, gross and horribly overpriced. $40 per person for half a litre of vegetable oil. Don't recommend unless you like loud hip hop music and yelling across the table in order to talk to your fellow foodies. All-white staff made it feel more trendy than authentic. Signature chicken was ok but the sauces were basically salt with a side of condiment."}
{"text":"First of all, the food is very disappointing and over priced. What is worse was the service.  We got there and made the reservation. They told us to come back after an hour, when we get back, people lined behind us already got the table Anna server told us to wait for another hour. Will never recommend anyone to go there."}
{"text":"Having visited Singapore several times, I tried the chicken rice as it was my first visit. It was good and I enjoyed the ginger on the side. (see my photo)

Kaya toast is one of my favourite Singaporean treats. Jackpot's is served differently - with ice cream. I was hoping to have it with kopi but they don't serve it. Very enjoyable anyway!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! It has excellent food quality, atmosphere, and customer service. We ordered the jackpot chicken, rice for 2, baked mussels, winter melon soup, deep fried chicken skin and the coconut rum drink. Everything was great. My favourite was actually rice which was very aromatic, light and fluffy - the seasoning was fantastic as well. It's probably even better than some highly recommended places in Singapore I've tried. My only dislike is the fried chicken skin tastes like it's old ans definitely was not fresh. 
Laura, our waitress was so welcoming and friendly! 
Their coconut rum drink is served in an actual coconut and so refreshing and light! Never thought coconut and rum would taste so good!
In terms of atmosphere, it was very hipster and modern with great music! The lighting was a big dark for my liking but it was manageable. 
Overall, I would highly recommend coming!"}
{"text":"I already loved Patois, so I was really looking forward to trying Jackpot.

This is pretty much Singapore style chicken rice and it is the real deal - we had the jackpot chicken rice with crispy skin, the kaffir broccoli appetizer, some braised baby bok choy, and I had a local IPA from Blood Brother brewing. I got some fois gras on my chicken rice, which was a bit decadent but perfect. The rice is perfectly oily and full of flavour, the chicken is velvety and soft and I am a sucker for salty, crispy fried skin - I will be back for this. The soup tasted just like the chicken it was cooked in.
 We both licked our plates clean.
Love the decor, fun and modern with a nod to it's Chinatown roots, fun plastic colander light fixtures - really bright and colourful. I love Patois but I might love this place even more."}
{"text":"Way too expensive for what you get. It's decent tasting but nothing that you cant find anywhere else in Chinatown for way better prices"}
{"text":"Simple dishes done well in a fun atmosphere. The biggest test for me is would I go back?  And the answer is YES."}
{"text":"Man, there are very few places that I will miss. Jackpot chicken rice is definitely one of them ! Why? Because the hainan style chicken rice tastes better than the original one I tasted in hainan. The fat comes from chicken just melt in your mouth, ridiculous! I also ordered the magic noodle, which is definitely a picture just but let me tell you secretly that nothing beats the signature Hainan chicken here. Also, there are also some cool cocktail drinks ! Super affordable and you will see some students coming."}
{"text":"Review from my visit in Feb 2018
- funky fusion decor
- chicken was flavourful, good quality and can taste the marinating alcohol. I prefer the chicken to be a little more chewy
- chicken doesn't come with rice. Minimum order of rice was for 2 ppl
- kind of expensive
- broccoli tempura ($9) was crisp and tasty. can't taste the keffir lime leaves. a little greasy, maybe didn't fry at the right temperature
- okonomiyaki burger - big patty served on a sizzling plate. onions on the bottom - pickled ginger and okonomiyaki sauce as garnish. Burger is crisp on the outside, but lack flavour in the center. It's a japanaese style patty so probably mixed with panko and egg, so the patty is not very dense

Overall: Good attempt at putting new spin to traditional dishes. However, sometimes simple is best."}
{"text":"We decided to try something new and ended up here. Wasn't disappointed. We ordered the Jackpot Chicken and the lobster E-fu noodles. The lobster tasted really fresh. The decor was really cute with Asian strainers as lanterns. Wasn't as filling as we liked though"}
{"text":"My friends brought me to this place and I had no expectations whatsoever. I don't really know what chicken rice is supposed to be. We ordered the $109 meal for 4. 
First thing is this meal is hardly fit for 4. When you read the items on the menu you feel like you're getting a lot, but that's not the case. Food is not even separated in portions(example: you get a burger and it's your job to split it somehow into 4 pieces). For $109 we got 1 burger, 2 boiled eggs, 6 small dumplings, 1/2 jerk chicken, 1/2 fried chicken, 1 pot of rice, 4 winter melon soups(chicken broth with 1 piece inside), and a small sort of biscuit with bacon. Other than the burger, rice and the chicken this is hardly anything more than tiny appetizers.  

They try to mix various kitchens into their own unique mix and every time the waitress brought something she tried to explain how it was prepared. It did sound fancy but for the most part it tasted so plain which makes me think if they put so much effort and it tastes like that it's not worth it at all. Food: 
Burger was decent even though the bun seemed like a Chinese pastry. Impossible to split in any way among us.
Jerk chicken was overcooked but tasty.
Fried chicken was good too.
Apetizers were really small and nothing stood out. 
The best part for me was the rice! 
Overall, the food is a bit of a mess. They tried to mix foods but didn't succeed with the presentation. Most things just tasted average. I'd rate it more like 2.5 stars

Service and interior: we were seated fairly quickly and the waitress was polite but forgot to bring us glasses at some point so we had to remind her. That's not a big deal. Different people were bringing food and while some were pretty detailed explaining ingredients, one fellow was just bringing the meals and leaving them on the table. Quite inconsistent!
I remember there was another place before in that location so they kept the drawing inside. It's a nice interior and much more than what I expected for Chinatown. 

After trying almost all the food on the menu I don't think there's much to try anymore. In the end I wasn't looking forward to going back again. This seemed like a pretty average restaurant to me that's just trying too hard to be somehow unique. In any case, I would definitely advise against getting the whole meal deal! Just get a single item on the menu."}
{"text":"Vibe is pretty good but food is definitely not worth the price. Their main dish jackpot chicken doesn't come with rice and was alright (not tender). All portions are relatively small. The stickies were best out of all the dishes we got."}
{"text":"Great food and cute decorations. Very pleasant place to catch up with friends and family. 
It is pricier than most restaurants in the neighbourhood, but the portion is decent.
No AC is a sure pain in summertime. Would recommend for a cooler season."}
{"text":"I had lunch here with several friends on a weekday and it was surprisingly quite busy. The Jackpot chicken lunch combo (~$13) came with a wintermelon soup which was a nice addition. The rice is cooked in chicken stock making it quite flavourful while the sauces gave the traditional chicken a nice twist, definitely a tasty, savoury dish. I got mine with the crispy chicken skin (+$2) which was delicious. The off menu ramen ($15) is unique in presentation and although the magic of the floating chopsticks does wear off quickly, you do get a decent amount and variation of protein and it was quite flavourful. Although the food was good, the portion sizes were small, which was the consensus among our group as the chicken is traditionally a cheap dish. The decor is vibrant and modern and service was great. Overall, a nice place for a casual, fun meal with friends or a date as long as you don't mind the price!"}
{"text":"Growing up on Hainan Chicken Rice, I had to give this restaurant a try upon randomly discovering it while walking in Chinatown.  It was pretty busy for a Saturday night and we got seats at the bar.  The chef was fantastic and very sociable. On a side note, the owners of Jackpot Chicken are also the owners of Patois (Asian/Jamaican fusion restaurant). The chicken rice was actually quite good, however the portions were small for the price.  We also ordered the only dessert on the menu: kaya bread with ice cream.  The dessert had a nice texture and the ice cream was very flavourful.  Would come back since it is the only Hainan chicken rice place I know of downtown."}
{"text":"Came here as a table for 1. I don't usually eat in a restaurant on my own, the staff definitely made you feel welcome, and super chill. I was weary in Chinatown, eating a legendary Asian dish, with the staff of diversity. The food is bomb, and I must say ranked #1 for Hainan chicken (they called it Jackpot Chicken). I must also note I had this dish in many Asian countries. 

I want to give props to the Operation Manager, Andrew. He and I had a few great conversation and he took good care of me. He noticed I took out half my meal, inquiring why, and realizing I was saving it for my family (we previously wanted to go, but realized the store was closed on arrival). As a goodwill gesture, he gave extra rice (these arnt just white rice) for my family to try. It was a great move, cause now the whole family is ragging me for more. 

Try this place out. PS : the vegetarian XO sauce is made in house and heavenly"}
{"text":"Tried the roast chicken rice and the crispy skin jackpot chicken rice. Everything tastes amazing! The chicken was very juicy and the crispy skin was quite unique. The wintermelon soup was flavourful but the rice was the best! I've had hainanese chicken rice many times before and thought it was one of the best tasting.

My only complaint is that the portions are quite small for its price. After tax and tips it was around $18 per person but we left the restaurant still hungry. The food is definitely really good and I would be tempted to go back but the only thing stopping me is its price. I feel that the $18 would be worth it if they provided more food. 

I love the painting on the wall with the baby and the watermelon! So cute and unique"}
{"text":"3 stars, because the value is poor.

I had a very similar experience here for lunch today to Sabrina D's.  I came for a quick Chinatown lunch, so I just ordered the Jackpot Chicken Rice.

Service was fine, hostess kept asking me if I wanted add-ons and cocktails, it seemed like a never-ending list of questions to get to my lunch.  Even my server later on asked if I wanted dessert (no, I have somewhere to be!).

For the food, here's what I got:
For $13.75, I got a chicken leg/thigh, cooked very nicely (very smooth, and tender), with chicken skin (crispy, the way I ordered), a small bowl of soup, and 2 sauces (sriracha, and ginger/scallion).  The rice portion... was tiny.  It definitely was not a bowl of white rice like you gt at most other Chinese places.

Given the price, quality, and quantity, I can't see myself returning.  King's Noodle a few doors down has very tasty chicken rices, larger quantities, and lower prices.  If I were on a diet, I'd come back.

After taxes & tips, $13.75 becomes $18.  At King's Noodle, I get more food, and pay at the counter quickly.  Not sure how long this Jackpot, will last."}
{"text":"This is a nice change of scenery for downtown Chinatown, as the restaurant is more modern and plays the kind of music you would expect in Little Portugal! The menu offers a wide variety of options. I particularly enjoyed the Brocolli Tempura. Goes great with a cold Singha or Tiger beer. The rice was a close second, very rich and flavorful. The chicken was cooked well and tied everything together. Staff were very friendly. It's a bit cold in the winter so would suggest wearing a warm sweater!"}
{"text":"Very slow service, and it's very expensive for what it is. Food was not great. My husband felt nausceous after eating here and wanted to throw up some time after we left the restaurant."}
{"text":"The chicken was okay but very pricey considering it didn't come with rice. Also ordered a tofu which was good as well and their shrimp wonton like appetizer. Overall, food was OK.. Came with 2 relatively small eaters and none of us were full and thought it was expensive"}
{"text":"Location/Service
Right in Chinatown (where Lucky Red used to be). Side street parking is available, there are also a few green P lots around the area. The restaurant has an intimate, bar/club feeling to it, interesting decor. I like how they use of baskets as lightning decoration. Staff were pretty chill and friendly.

Food
I didn't have the chance to try a wide variety of items, as it was more of a late-night snack with a few friends. Since this was a Singaporean restaurant, had to try their Jackpot Chicken (i.e. Hainanese Chicken Rice). The chicken itself was good - the meat wasn't dry, and it was still chewy. The soft skin was still intact and there was a good amount of ginger and scallion. The rice was also nice - liked how it was infused with their own made stock, making it very fragrant and comforting to eat. 

One thing I do want to note is really the quantity and price (okay, maybe two things). The chicken and rice were separate items on the menu (usually it's one single dish). The chicken itself was $16 and honestly, the portion was really small. If I didn't eat before hand, the chicken alone would serve more as an appetizer - and to add $6 (family of 2 portion) for the rice, it is a  pricey dish. Any other restaurant serving this dish would have it almost half the price and twice the quantity. Judging from only one item I am a little hesitant to try other items on the menu for what it's worth. Hopefully there would be improvements in the future for me to try and change the rating."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place as one of my favourite foodies recommended this AMAZING Jackpot Chicken!

We order the jackpot chicken, the broccoli and special rice. I might have had my hopes up too high for the chicken... I've had better in the area. The waitress highly recommended the broccoli, we both found it overly greasy and there seemed to be more crunchy bits compared to the broccoli. The rice was the nicest of all of the dishes we shared.

The service was attentive.
The atmosphere was innovative, they used colanders to make light fixtures- which I found creative. 

Over all it wasn't half bad, I did leave full... but my tummy felt full of grease."}
{"text":"This place has the Hainan chicken rice which was a singapore dish and I thought this would be run by Asians.  However, all staffs are causasian which was a total surprise since it is located in Chinatown.  The music was loud like in a sport bar which kind of gives me a headache.  The chicken was really well marinated, soft and supple.  It was cooked jusr right and the chicken oil rice was fluffy and delicious.  I was pleasantly surprise with good texture and flavours.  If the music is not as loud, it would be a good hang out place."}
{"text":"The experience was extraordinary. I wasn't craving southeast Asian cuisine in particular but you could never go wrong win Chicken rice(known Singaporean dish)! The chicken rice was very authentic in my opinion as it was on par with the ones I had in Singapore. The pork neck was also quite delicious. This restaurant was a good choice. It was really pretty, creatively and artistically decorated. The food was good. Although I just wouldn't come here during rush hour if you're really hungry, because the wait for the food was rather long. But I mean it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"This was a planned visit. I noticed they take reservations as well which might be a good idea if you are a larger group IMO. My exposure to Hainanese Chicken rice is from the Far East mainly. Whenever I would visit a food court a popular item seemed to be a bland looking chicken with with a bowl rice and some sides of dipping sauces. One spot in Singapore had even lineups that spanned half an hour! So at an off peak hour I decided to try that spot to see what the fuss is about as Singapore is serious about food courts. Not knowing what to expect from this dish I was perplexed as the chicken was quite bland even with the dipping sauces. My palate wasn't developed for rice at that stage in life so didn't appreciate the true star of this dish i.e. the rice. That spot in Singapore was inexpensive so I treated it as a version of fast food and a local delicacy. I did start to appreciate the rice after a prolonged exposure so decided to give this dish a try for the rice alone. Luckily I found a friend to join in on this visit at the last min. So after a bit of convincing we decided to try the Jackpot and Fire roasted versions of the chicken along with a schmaltzy rice for 2. The Kaya toast caught my eyes as well. Now for the spot itself hmm not sure what they are going for here as it has a gaudy painting drawn on the wall (OK if they are going for a street side spot from that region I suppose) along with the dinnerware (I like the glasses they use for drinks as have bought a set as a gift in the past). The service is decent as we were checked on regularly. 
The food does take its time so if you are thinking a quick grab and go spot this isn't it. 
Now for the mains the fire roasted version is OK and spice reasonably. The Jackpot chicken is bland as expected. The main attraction rice is flavorful I will give them that and dipping sauce/condiments are decent. Hmm they are priced on the high side IMO for this type of food. There are plenty of of other options including adding a foie gras add on! 
I might come back to try the Kaya toast and Foie. 2.5 stars"}
{"text":"Last time I came here was over a year ago and the menu has slightly changed since then. Was looking forward the Lucky 7 combo but it wasn't on the menu anymore. They did have the Jackpot Chicken although the rice was an extra cost (as was the chicken skin, soup etc which were on the Lucky 7 combo). I forget how much the Lucky 7 combo was but the price point for what I got seemed unreasonably expensive. Paid half the price for the same thing in Houston for a dish that was arguably better. The service and staff were great and attentive. The atmosphere is intimate and new. And I enjoyed my beer on the side."}
{"text":"We had SUCH a great time here tonight. You are smart to make a reservation as people who arrived without one were in for a two-hour wait when we were there. The place is loud, and the vibe is great. Great decor as well, with whimsical baskets for light fixtures and great murals on the walls. We loved our cocktails :) There is one red wine and one white wine, by the glass or the bottle. We ordered the red, at a very reasonable price, and it went really well with the food. Three of us split the dinner for four, and it was truly a feast. Everything was really good, but I especially loved the tempura broccoli and the bok choy, and of course, the chicken. The rice was also extremely yummy. Certainly worth your time and money. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The food: 4 star
The price: 3 star

The hainan chicken was well-done, very tender and flavorful. BUT this is not sufficient to justify its high price since the portion is not generous at all."}
{"text":"Authentic Singapore food, great value at lunchtime.
Cooking takes 15mins, make sure you can wait before order."}
{"text":"First thing we got in there is like we know is not gonna be the chicken rice that we want. So we still give it a try for the chicken rice and roasted chicken rice. 

The important thing for hainanese chicken rice is the rice, chicken and the hot sauce right. 

We ordered 2 meals, 1 is the hainanese chicken rice and the other one is the roasted chicken rice meal. The rice taste different from one to another. How can that be ?? 

The hainanese chicken was ok but a little too soft and the worst part is that they use SIRACHA to be the hot sauce for the chicken ???? This is a shame ... 

All I taste for the roasted chicken is pinches of salt on the chicken. Roasted chicken rice is also a well known meal in Malaysia and Singapore. 

Complimentary soup that comes with the meal is MSG soup. Rather not include the soup if it is MSG soup. 

Over priced chicken rice and I really don't mind paying $15 for a plate of chicken rice if it is good. This is nothing close to any of the street food chicken rice in Asia."}
{"text":"This is the new restaurant from the people at Patois. I had really high hopes coming to Jackpot, as I grew up eating Hainan Chicken Rice. I have search everywhere in Toronto and Markham but NO ONE, makes a decent one. I have been to Tian Tian chicken rice in Singapore, Boon Tong Kee, and also Nong's Khao Man Gai in Portland. If there's famous chicken rice, I'm there. 

I ordered the meal size ($13.75) Jackpot Chicken Rice with extra crispy skin. The chicken was soft, tender and delicious. It says they use ethically raised Ontario chicken, and I like the fact that they don't use yellow food colouring to make it look \"free range\" like other places I have been to. The oil rice was flavourful and had the fragrant smell of Pandan, a must for chicken rice. This is by far THE BEST chicken rice I had out of all the places I mentioned. It's more gourmet than Nong's and hawker bars in Singapore. The dipping sauces were all on point and tasted authentic. 

You get a lot of value for $13 bucks. Not sure what other yelpers are comparing prices to, maybe places in Markham or Asia? But you can't even get a burger combo downtown for $13. At Jackpot you get deboned chicken, rice, and soup. I have had other chicken rice in Markham, it ranged from $9 to $16, but bone in, and watered down soup. 

This definitely exceeded my expectations.  It's a great place to come with friends and if you don't want to spend a lot of money, under $20! They created an atmosphere that has a great vibe, as well as delicious food. I will definitely come back to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"Food: 3.5/5
Service: 3/5
Atmosphere: 3.5/5
Price: $$$

The high roller ramen was delicious, garlicy, crunchy and flavourful from the Chinese sausage (lap cheung) but the management was super strict about the timeframe to serve the dish. Kinda snobby about it but whatever..

We also ordered:
Thai Apple Salad: 4/5 -second best dish after the ramen
Potstickers: 3/5 
Jackpot Chicken: 3/5 
Shrimp Laksa Toast: 2.5/5 - I usually enjoy laksa but this version didn't have a strong enough taste to my liking.
Killa Prawns: 3/5 
Schmaltzy rice: 3.5/5

It was kind of pricy for what it is, and some dishes are just 'okay'."}
{"text":"While my brother and his gf were visiting from out of town, we we're on the prowl for a dessert place in chinatown but the one we had been eyeing closed as soon as we got there. boo hoo. As we we're walking home we spotted this place and thought we should grab lunch from there tomorrow before they leave so I didn't read reviews about this place. I regret not doing my due diligence. Although my brother and gf we're satisfied with the meal, we couldn't help but feel ripped off for the price and portion considering you're in chinatown. Flavour wise nothing to write home about. I think we enjoyed the atmosphere more. I hope this is not a new trend in chinatown where mediocre food is trying to gentrify the area and inflate prices."}
{"text":"I'm actually rather shocked by the reviews, come here with my girlfriend once ever 2 or so weeks. It's fantastic. The rice isn't over seasoned but has an extremely pleasant hint of ginger. Chicken, having almost zero seasoning on it, some how is filled with flavour, definitely don't use msg because I have an allergy to it, so that was a plus for me. The chicken skin, which some people have complained about is my favourite thing here. The trick is to take the skin, put a little bit of hot sauce and rice on it and devour it. It's absolutely delicious. I will continue coming to this gem on spadina regardless what haters say, and you should too. Their simplicity on the menu is a bonus, don't need to look at pages for 15 minutes to decide what you want. They have successfully perfected the poached chicken and rice in my eyes, no need to distract people with loads of options. Give it a try folks, you'll enjoy it."}
{"text":"The last time I was there will actually be the last time I go here. The chicken was gross and slimy. seemed undercooked. The chicken skin was gross. Overpriced for what you get. The rice was ok. 
The service was horrible also. The staff seems like they smoke weed. Just feel unattentive and spaced out. Do not go here. Spend your money somewhere else."}
{"text":"Warning: if you are a party of 7 or more, you are forced to order their tasting menu (served family style) at $20+ something a person. Um, what if your entire party just wants Hainan chicken?! Such crap. 

So, our party of 7 split up to groups of 4 and 3 and ordered what we wanted. The server didn't seem happy about it and her face showed her frustration when we decided to separate. We called her out on it. She was shocked, but was all smiles the rest of our stay. 

The Hainan chicken is probably the best in the city, and is comparable to Savoy in LA (but not quite there)."}
{"text":"I have to say that the service at Jackpot Chicken Rice was very good. They were attentive and really took the time and effort to ensure their customers had a good time at their restaurant. 

The restaurant has a hipster feel. The menu is not strictly Singaporean or Chinese. It is a play on Singaporean and Chinese dishes and flavours. It is a fusion of Asian dishes with western flair.  

For the appetizers, we got the popcorn chicken and watermelon salad. The popcorn chicken was medicore, but the watermelon flavor was a delightful fusion of flavours - citrusy and sweet. 

For the entree, we got the signature Jackpot Chicken Rice dish which was Jackpot Chicken Rice's take on Hainanese Chicken (usually found in Hawker markets in Singapore).  The dish is a tender poached chicken served with rice made from chicken stock.  The dish comes with a melon soup. The poach chicken is done well. 

The food at Jackpot Chicken Rice is delicious, but the dishes do not come at Hawker market prices."}
{"text":"2-2.5

I should've known but I still came here because I was curious about their Hainan chicken rice. 

Our server persuaded us to order the broccoli tempura appetizer which was good yes, but for 10 small pieces I will not pay $6 for that again.

My cousin ordered the Hainan chicken rice while I ordered the roasted chicken rice with the latter being $1 more expensive. 

When we got our food, we noticed it was a small portion and we were right because we wolfed that down pretty quick...or were we just hungry? But I would say it is definitely on the smaller side for the price you pay. My cousin said the chicken was salty and the original Hainan chicken rice or even the ones you can get uptown are way better.

We also noticed that the rice was soggy...I mean who cooks soggy rice?! We expressed that concern to the server at the end of our meal. I'm a little disappointed with Chef Craig Wong as I'm a fan of Patois. But maybe for those who aren't familiar with Chinese cuisine or Hainan chicken in general should give it a try."}
{"text":"The evening started with two delicious appetizers: the tempura broccoli and Thai slaw salad with apples. It was downhill from there. When we ordered we specifically asked about spice. The tofu was too spicy for us to bite into. We had to send it back but they were hardly apologetic. The melon soup had no flavour and the jackpot chicken tasted like boiled chicken. Luckily for the restaurant, the dark sweet soy sauce on the table saved the bland chicken. The schmaltz rice was without a doubt the star of the entrees. I felt underwhelmed by the service. Right after they cleared the last plate, our bill came without asking if we wanted anything else. Even though the broccoli made us lick our fingers, I can't say that is enough to bring me back here."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good and definitely convenient given the location. I agree with everyone else. The portions were very small and the price was on the high side. I would come back if it wasnt so pricey."}
{"text":"Basic ass chicken with flavourless sauce and trash rice. I could have made this for like $8 but instead I paid $30. Absolutely not worth it. Colossal waste."}
{"text":"Too pricy for the food. The 'famous rice' can't be more dry."}
{"text":"I got addicted to chicken rice during my visit to Singapore, so when I heard there was a chicken rice shop opening in Toronto, I obviously had to convince my friends to come along with me to try this new place. 

Taking Lucky Red's location, the shop has actually maintained a lot of the decor (e.g. tables, main door) that was used by Lucky Red. 

I came here on a Saturday evening around 7pm and the place wasn't too busy, my group was able to get a table quite quickly. Although the size of the restaurant is quite small like many other places in Chinatown. 

We were not disappointed with the food. They had a lucky 7 combo which doubled the amount of chicken and also had a marinated egg on the side, which seemed like pretty good value for $21. I have to echo the other reviews and say that their portions are relatively small. I wasn't particularly hungry, but I still went with the regular size and the serving was just enough for me. However, if you're feeling hungry, I would recommend their lucky 7 combo and maybe an appetizer for good measure. The tempura broccoli is a good app to share!

Service was great, our server was very attentive. It's definitely one of the few places in Chinatown that actually cares about providing quality service. The only issue I had was that they didn't accept Amex. 

Give this place a try if you're feeling nostalgic for some good chicken rice or if you're missing Patois and want to get your fix."}
{"text":"A new great spot in Chinatown from the team who is familiar to many known as Patois Toronto. From the attracting baby blue exterior painting, to the very colorful graffiti interior with colanders enclosed together as light bulb covers, this place will give you a very good vibe. Very spacious, informative staff and AMAZING chicken rice.

So, on the menu they have choices of Southern Asian style roasted chicken, poached hainanese chicken, and tofu mushroom. All served with rich, schmaltzy rice and winter melon soup. You can choose the snack size or the meal. There's more awesome stuff on their menu, but I believe that these three dishes are the super stars.

I got the sambal glazed roasted chicken snack size ($9.75), which also came with rice, winter melon soup and Thai fish sauce. Let me tell you, every bit of rice that goes in my mouth is heavenly. The rice was very very tasty and flavorful. The chicken rice flavor reminds me of a Filipino chicken soup dish called Tinola. The soup and flavor tastes similar which was very comforting and definitely brought me back home.  

Take note, the snack size portion is not your typical snack size (small). I do not eat huge portions, so the snack size was perfect for me yet it was enough to fill me up. At Jackpot, their snack size will fill you up just right. The chicken was big enough plus the rice & soup, wish there were more rice though to balance out with the chicken. I think I would order some extra schmaltz rice next time! A-M-A-Z-I-N-G chicken rice and its now in Toronto!     

Make sure you go check this place out because Jackpot is home. I will be coming back for more.

***Cash only for now."}
{"text":"Nice interior, food a bit on the pricier side but tasted pretty good. Came here for the flying noodles all round the Internet, taste very good actually except it is very heavy in flavour. The jackpot chicken is actually quite average, I have tried better one in other restaurants before. However they really need a lot of improvement on their service. Went to the restaurant at 4-5 pm, the restaurant only had 2-3 tables of customers. Yet when you walk in, none of the servers try to serve us or put us to a table. Very inattentive, need to ask for water or they will never serve you a drink, also we need to go to the counter asking for napkins and the bill because the servers never look at the customers. They were talking to each other or wondering around, BUT not to pay attention to their customers."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this restaurant but there was just too many issues with what we ordered for me to enjoy my meal. We ordered the all in with jackpot chicken, Crispy prawns,  steamed bok choy, and shrimp dumplings. The all in comes with crispy chicken skin and winter melon soup. It was a Saturday and it was busy with a large table being served ahead of us so there was a wait for our food however I was surprised when almost every dish we ordered came out on the lukewarm side. Most of this food is very oily , eating lukewarm oily chicken is not ideal. The first Item brought  to our table was the crispy chicken skin and honestly it was gross. I'm not sure how anyone ate it , it had a rancid oil taste and I couldn't even finish one small bite. If this is the best they can do they should take it off the menu. I liked the shrimp dumplings but again there was a temperature problem they were lukewarm to room temperature and the skin on the dumplings was too thick. The bok choy isn't steamed or a healthy choice since it's covered in oil and fried bits. Hainese chicken was OK but again temperature was an issue and you can get a lot better and a lot cheaper at more standard Chinese restaurants. The rice was yummy but very oily but it was probably the thing I enjoyed most. The prawns covered in some sort of cereal were bland and boring and I regret ordering them. The cocktail I had was overly sweet and overly spiced and heavy handed.  Environment is fun and I like the concept , it's a shame that the taste and culinary technique don't live up to the hype."}
{"text":"This was a fun dining experience with my pals because we're talking about a share plate situation. I've never had this kind of chicken before (steamed to tasty perfection) and it did not disappoint, especially with the delicious condiments of scallion sauce and basic sriacha."}
{"text":"Came here just for the high rolla noodles that was available for a limited time (may12). The atmosphere and interior of the restaurant was really nice and vibrant. Love the laterns hung on the ceiling made by corianders. The staff were also very friendly and when they served the dishes, they made sure to explain what was on the plate. I guess all these factors contributed to the premium price we paid for the normal Asian food we regularly eat. The Haienese style chicken and rice was $14. The flavor was good but the portion size was disappointing for the price. It came with really salty soup. We did not opt for the extra $2 for crispy skin as reviews said it was not worth it. We also ordered the high rolla noodles which was $15. It was your typical instant noodle stir fried with shrimp and tofu. It tasted good but not justified for the price. The floating chopstick was a fun gimmick but definitely a one time experience. We probably won't be heading back anytime soon"}
{"text":"it was good - not great. somethings bit too salty - but i absolutely loves the rice! thats the most unique, yummy rice - i have ever had. i would go back for the rice only."}
{"text":"A solid 3. 

This place epitomizes \"Toronto\" food nowadays; a nicely decorated restaurant serving overpriced traditional food, in an unorthodox location. In this case, a restaurant serving unnecessarily fancy haianese chicken rice in the middle of Chinatown. Hm.

That being said, the food isn't bad. If anything, I thought that the Jackpot chicken meal ($13.75) tasted good. The chicken was tender and moist, the onion/ginger sauce was flavourful, and the fried chicken skin was an interesting surprise. There are even add on options like foie gras ($12) and chinese greens ($4). However, the portion sizes made me rethink the value of this meal. For $13.75, I would love to get more than just 1 drumstick and a small piece of thigh; this makes me wonder just how small the snack size is...

But anyways, we had pretty great service tonight. Everyone who served us did so with a genuine smile, and they refilled our water and cleared our dishes promptly.

(Side note, Im not a fan of the plastic colander light fixtures...lanterns would definitely be nicer. Is this a nod to days spent roadside in Asia?)"}
{"text":"Finally got to try Jackpot yesterday after seeing the hype on social media. The crab bao was okay, but what greatly disturbed my friends and I were the 8 small pieces of Cereal Prawns that cost $21. Twenty-one dollars. Wow. My friends whom I brought with me used to live in Singapore so apparently the taste was horrendously far from the cereal prawn that's famous in Singapore. We were really astounded that the price didn't reflect the quality NOR the quantity. Will never go back to Jackpot ever again. I've been a Yelp member and normally wouldn't do a bad review of a place but this really enraged us. Be careful, you guys."}
{"text":"The food here is definitely tastey but the portion is small and the price too high. $18 after tax and tip?! Come on guys... Worth trying but there's amazing Hainan chicken a couple blocks down at Bun Saigon, and it comes with a side of pho broth. Just saying..."}
{"text":"Located in the chinatown and this place is so much better than any other restaurants in Chinatown. Service was excellent and we let our server to decided our menu. She ordered:

 Hainanese chicken: super moist and tender
Jackpot chicken: excellent flavor and mosit
Foie Grois dumpling: tasted interesting and new kind of dumpling
Special rice : very flavourable they cooked with chicken broth.
Soysauce eggs: half cooked spy sauce marinated. 

I would recommend this place if you are craving for moist and tender chicken. 

The downside is this place is super cold because everytime when the door is opened, the wind would just blow in. It is freezing if you sit near the door."}
{"text":"I saw so many posts about their secret menu High Rolla ramen and I wanted to try it out. Note that it is available until May 12th.
My boyfriend and I went there on Wednesday around 12.30pm and the place was quite busy. 

I ordered their High Rolla Ramen ($15) and my boyfriend ordered their Jackpot Chicken rice ($13.75). The ramen was held in the air with a pair of chopsticks, which were in turn held on by a fork, which was buried in a half cut raw potato. Accompanying the noodles were chinese sausage, tofu, bean sprouts, 5 shrimps and a seasoned egg. The ramen were good, but it was a bit too salty to my taste. 

As for the jackpot chicken, the chicken was poached cooked, served with white rice mixed with a kind of sauce/oil, green onion and ginger, chili sauce, and a bowl of chicken soup. The whole dish was yummy; the meat was moist, and had a good taste, especially with the accompanying sauces. 

The foods were good, but they're a little too pricey. Overall, service was good (5/5), foods were (4.5/5), price is (3/5), cleanliness and atmosphere (4.5/5)."}
{"text":"I am living for the decor - love the plastic vegetable baskets as lamp covers and the painted Chinese baby and flowers on the walls. When I walked into Jackpot, I've noticed that the place smelled like incense - made me think of going into an elderly relative's home for dinner during an auspicious holiday. Everything about Jackpot certainly makes it stand out from the Chinese restaurants in the area. 

The food was good - I definitely ended up having itis after having the jackpot chicken. The winter melon soup was interesting with the deep fried onions floating around. The jackpot chicken was good. A little too greasy overall for my liking. Price-wise, I feel like it was a bit over-priced. I was expecting the best Hainan chicken but I didn't - it was just okay. I probably would have gotten better Hainan chicken for much less than $16 at a lesser known restaurant. 

Service was friendly and accommodating. 

My overall take? It's better to come in a group so you can sample a variety of dishes rather than sampling just one or two items - it would be worth the money and you probably wouldn't be as underwhelmed)."}
{"text":"I popped over here during a bar hopping night with my boyfriend. I got the hibiscus negroni from the recommendation of our lovely server, he got a Tiger beer and we both got a large order of the chicken skins to share. 

The hibiscus negroni was delicious! The ice cube was made of juice so the drink didn't become more watered down as it melted. The chicken skins were crunchy and not too salty. 

Unfortunately we were already full from dinner at another spot so we didn't get their jackpot chicken, but we will definitely be back to try it! I love that it comes in the wooden pails to keep the rice warm. 

Decor is trendy and fun. A must try for those looking for something new and different than the usual spots around Chinatown."}
{"text":"As it was our first visit the server gave us a good description of how the chicken was made, the choice of dishes, etc. I ordered the Jackpot chicken. Was then asked how hungry we were, I said \"not very hungry\" he said 'for you I highly recommend the wintermelon soup', I said...'I want less food not more' and smiled.  'Don't think that went over well.  I don't like being obviously \"upsold\"..you just want to relax not guard your wallet.  'Had dinner, the chicken was really good, it came with two sauces a fine green onion, ginger sauce and a home made chili sauce I believe.  I asked another server for a takeout container as I had half the chicken and half the sauces remaining.  He said he'd box it up for me.  I go to take it for lunch today and see none of the remaining sauces were there!  That's why from now on I'll insist on a takeout container being brought to the table. They think they're doing you a favour...if you're gonna do this, it's better to pack everything from the plate than to leave out a key part of the dish!"}
{"text":"Hit the Jackpot here! I fell in love with Hainanese chicken rice when I first  visited Singapore and have been disappointed since returning back to Toronto. Until now. Jackpot has mastered the recipe. I had the Jackpot Chicken Rice which was tender and delicious. It was paired brilliantly with ginger and winter melon soup. My husband had the Roast Chicken Rice (which he didn't want to share, but did end up letting me have a few bites) We also had the Broccoli Tempura and Baby Fish Fry which were fun and tasty appetizers perfect for sharing. Staff was great! Our waiter Spencer was very knowledgeable about the menu and super friendly! The bartender Amy also introduced herself to us and made me a delicious Singapore Sling. It was like being in a Singapore hawker bar with amazing service, except I didn't have to fly overseas. Totally recommend!"}
{"text":"Having grown up on poached chicken 'Asian' style I was anxious to give this new place a try. 

We opted for the Jackpot chicken with crispy skin and a side order of 'veg'. Chicken was perfectly cooked, moist and tender, while the crispy skin added a nice compliment to the soft chicken meat. The side condiments, ginger with scallions and a kicked up hot sauce, were excellent. Winter melon soup was a nice touch.  All in all a very tasty 'peoples' meal. Mom couldn't do better. 

Service friendly, establishment spotless (unusual for a restaurant let alone a restaurant in Chinatown). 

 Hopefully they can maintain this quality of food over time."}

Service: 9.5/10
Value: 7/10
Hygiene: 10/10
Aesthetics: 8.5/10

I came here with a certain level of expectations, which probably makes my review biased. I have been looking to try this place since I learned that it opened up. Also, having had a lot of the dishes home-cooked probably makes it a lot harder to live up to expectations.

We ordered the Jackpot chicken and rice, the razor clams, and the winter melon soup. 

The razor clams came first, while they were seasoned really nicely, it was also waaaay too salty. It kind of made it into an uncomfortable decision of eating it cause the other flavours were great, but not wanting to eat it cause it was so salty. The soup came after, and the saltiness of the clams made the soup seem lacking. I make winter melon soup at home all the time with turkey so the flavours are much stronger so this might contribute to the feeling of blandness in the soup.

The jackpot chicken and rice soon followed and yet again I was a bit let down. While the chicken and rice were both decent. They failed to match up to other places in the GTA that serve Hainanese chicken rice (such as Lion City).

The service was great and very polite. They didn't leave us waiting long. 

The decor is a little unusual, but gives it a certain character. The style is reminiscent of the early 90s Chinatown with a hint of modern day graffiti (courtesy of the melon holding baby). A one-of-a-kind place for sure. The place is clean and well-kept. 

I think this is a nice spot if you're craving Singaporean food downtown. It's a little pricy for what you're getting. Its got decent atmosphere and decent food, but there are definitely a few other places I'd go to if I wasn't confined to Toronto."}
{"text":"I have only been here once. I got chicken on rice with foie gras, and a beer. Expensive expensive. The portion is small, and it tastes average. I only think it worth the price, if they offer 30% discounts.  The service is friendly though."}
{"text":"I live nearby and saw this new place for a long time. But most of my Chinese friends telling me it's not worth to try. But finally I made myself here.
The overall experience is awful. There is no one greeting at the front door. And I expect it's gona be fast, but it took almost half an hour to get my Hainan Chicken. They totally forgot my order. 
The soup is really good to be honest, but the chicken itself is not. It's not completely cooked through. I only had 2 bites and I'm telling myself that's it. Can't stand it anymore. 
And it is overpriced. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Had the original chicken rice lunch special. The rice was oily and so was the chicken. The crispy skin was SUPER salty and wasn't really special. It's also quite pricy for a restaurant in Chinatown, but it's pretty trendy and seems like a great bar at night."}
{"text":"It's an approachable introduction to a traditionally cold chicken meal. It was nice that the chicken was boneless but I was not content with the portion or the flavor. It felt toned down and not as punchy as i would have expected. The rice was delicious with a bit of bright flavor but the chicken did not live up to my expectations. I would say that if you are looking for Hainanese chicken, it is missing the pow of flavor from the ginger sauce. The old fashioned was good, not amazing. I just wanted more flavor."}
{"text":"Place was amazing. Kinda expensive. but the food was insane. Remind me of Asia. Atmosphere was nice more of a date place then anything else. For the different flavours where exact and feel like Asia all over again. Hai nan chicken is such an simple dish but done right its life changing. Amazing"}
{"text":"I walk by this restaurant often and thought I'd give it a try on a Saturday afternoon. I ordered the Kaffir broccoli tempura and jackpot chicken. I really enjoyed the broccoli, the combination of Kaffir lime leaf and Thai basil really made the flavour pop. The chicken dish could have been good but I find it way too salty, especially the chili sauce. Since this is supposedly a chicken rice restaurant, and because of that, I give it a 3 stars due to the overly salted rice dish."}
{"text":"The chicken was soo juicy and the decor was very cute. The biggest downfall is the price and portion. we had the two people rice portion which was definitely not enough. This was dinner options . The lunch options seem better priced from what i see on the menu"}
{"text":"Overall the food was great, but definitely overpriced. It would be great as a first date spot for two, however I was with a group of five and the portion sizes of each plate was quite small for all of us to munch on.

The best item was possibly the Crispy Shrimp Nuggets, the outer texture definitely added a tasty crunch to the dish (not to mention the sauces with each dish were pretty good) Also, some individuals may enjoy the chicken rice dish, which paired well with the rest of the dishes that we had. The pictures below include the Jackpot chicken, Foie Gras & Duck Confit Potstickers, & Cereal Killa Prawns. Each item had a great taste and did not disappoint. 

What made the experience was the aesthetic of the restaurant. Almost gave a \"hippie\" vibe...plus the music that played was A1. Service was great too. However, definitely overpriced for the amount of items we got."}
{"text":"Really happy I found some good chicken rice in Toronto. I'm from Singapore, so Hainanese chicken rice is my comfort food and this is an authentic, comparable version. 

They offer both roasted and poached. I got roasted and it was soft and flavourful. The rice had a ton of chicken flavour so it was tasty. They use hormone free, grain fed Ontario chicken which was good. The broth with winter melon was rich and flavourful. They provide ginger-scallion sauce, and some chili sauces. I wasn't a fan of the chili sauces because they were way too sweet and not spicy, they were tasty nonetheless. Perhaps I'm biased since I'm used to eating chicken rice with more savoury chili-ginger-garlic sauce that is common in Singapore. However, I've been to Thailand and the sweet chili sauce was prevalent with their version of the chicken rice. The portion for the 'snack' size was okay, not great, for the $9.75 price tag, and could've used more rice to balance out the rice to chicken ratio. 

Service was friendly and prompt, and the space, colours and decor are modern and nice. Right now it appears to be cash only.

Anyways, will likely be back to try some other things! Great addition to the hood."}
{"text":"We ordered traditional Jackpot chicken rice, so so so so so salty!!! My friend ate salt particles! The portion is so small. My friends and I were not full. It is not worthy for 13.75 per portion before tax. Won't go there again!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but everything was just way too salty! We ordered the \"Go All In\" dinner and chose the following dishes: Hainanese chicken rice, sizzling hamburg okonomiyaki, tempura broccoli, crispy skin, soy sauce eggs, and popcorn chicken. With the exception of the tempura broccoli which was delicious, everything else was OVERLOADED WITH SALT and I had to chug approximately 3 litres of water after dinner to compensate. Unfortunately I would not go back a second time."}
{"text":"[BOTTOM LINE]
Simple menu. Delicious chicken (of course). A great option for a quick and delicious lunch. Centrally located, too.

[THE SPACE]
We loved the space. It was cool and casual and the music was great. We went during an off time (lunch around 2pm), but there were still a lot of people there. I'd make reservations ahead of time if you're coming for dinner or any other busy time. The wait staff was fantastic, as well.

[THE FOOD]
The lunch menu is really simple, in a good way. You should be coming here for the chicken, anyway. If we were hungrier, we'd have opted for the $38 'Lucky Dice' special for two, which has the jackpot chicken, wings, hamburg, and soup/salad.

We each got:
1) THE JACKPOT CHICKEN (with crispy skin) - $15 for the lunch special, which includes jackpot chicken, rice, ginger-scallion sauce, and winter melon soup. Loved it! Reminded me of my childhood (with the soft chicken skin as well). The ginger scallion sauce was pungent and tasty. The crispy skin is a must get, and almost \"chip\" like. Also the rice was killer (had a hint of chicken fat in it. Yea.)

2) ROAST CHICKEN RICE (with crispy skin) - Tastes like a mix between chicken and char siu. I liked the pickled green papaya that came with it. I'd go classic with the jackpot chicken, though. 

Next time I'd add a soy sauce egg, too! 

I know it's sometimes hard to justify getting Hainanese chicken for $15, but you get a hip restaurant and nice service with it. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"This is one of the one-time only places. The main reason being not full after ordering a main poached chicken meal for $13+.  I am a small eater and was still hungry after the tiny size which I originally thought was a snack size.  Food-wise, the chicken and the sauces were good, however I found the rice a bit too salty and not fragrant/flavourful enough; possibly need more shallot flavour.  

They asked me how the food was at the end of the meal and I thought I would give them an honest opinion about the size for the price and the rice being too salty.  Usually for restaurants that are newly opened, from my experience they are very welcome for true suggestions, really listen, and improve on them the next time I visit.  For Jackpot Chicken Rice, the only response was \"Sorry about that\", and didn't make me feel they really cared.  That tells a lot.

You'd better spend less money in other restaurants nearby that are tasty too and fill you up."}
{"text":"Our table of 2 had the Jackpot chicken and the Ramen and Shrimp Chips. It was so fun to see how the Ramen was presented. Ramen is only served until 6:30pm so go and try it when you can! Food was delicious! Service was great! I recommend making reservations because the restaurant filled up very quickly. Will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"The chicken rice is without a doubt the best in the city, and best I've had outside of Singapore.  What makes this place the best though is the service... cool laid back and hip vibe.  Special kudos to Adrian who took incredible care of us and made a spectacular ending to the weekend!"}
{"text":"Decided to check this place after hearing about the hype and walking past the location in Toronto. Similar to their sister restaurant Patois, Eat Jackpot is a modern take on Hainanese chicken rice and similar southeast Asian dishes.

The restaurant is smaller, hip, modern and fairly casual, with hip hop music playing in the background and colorful decor.

Coming from Singapore, I was excited by the menu - a wide selection of South Asian dishes, like chicken rice (obviously), shrimp toast with laksa sauce, oyster omelette, cereal prawns and foie grad and duck confit dumplings. They also had Tiger beer and a selection of cocktails. However, the dishes were expensive (chicken was $16 and you had to order the rice separately for $6) and the dishes were smaller portions better for sharing.

However, I came away impressed with the flavor of the chicken rice. It was delicious and tasted authentic and fresh, with delicious ginger and chili sauces. The high rolla ramen is also a must try. The service was also excellent and the server was full of tips on what to order.

Highly recommend trying - more for a casual bite to eat with a group of friends."}
{"text":"There's really a lot of hate for this place that is not quite warranted. Someone started an over-priced claim wagon and people have jumped on. I think the whole pricing vs portion issue has really overshadowed their offerings. Simply put the chicken while is not the best, it's still pretty good. Is it overpriced?....well sorta. Depends on perspective.

I can't claim to be a Hainanese chicken expert but I do know one thing; does it taste good? With that being said, I do like the creativity in their approach. Silky (not quite silky enough) chicken with crispy crackling skin. Chicken meat \"au naturel\" in flavour only then you get a \"slap to your gums\" of the salty briney skin.  And that rice is more reminiscent of a classic Vietnamese broken rice (Google this if you don't know!) than your typical Hainanese chicken rice. The individual components of the dish and overall profile is solid but where it lacks is the execution. The chicken is not quite silky enough while the skin is a tad too overpowering (too salty). The rice is a little reminiscent of soggy couscous and not enough of the squeaky, slightly grainy, oily rice of the classic Hainese dish. I think they could of gone a little heavier with the chicken fat on the rice. Oh! And that soup was maybe a little too flavourful (heavy on the salt) but adequate.

As for price...well that's subjective. Admittedly, it does hurt a little considering as an Asian I know I can get chicken (even Hainese chicken) for under $10 in a food court and under $20 for a massive plate of it at a finer establishment. However, I don't think it's too much of an issue. If you can pay upwards of $20 for chicken from crappy Swiss Chalet or a fried chicken sandwich from any fine establishment when you can get them from the food courts... then I don't see why you have to be so angry about paying $20 for Hainese chicken."}
{"text":"First time trying this from foodora and I LOVE it! Got the jackpot chicken with egg and crispy chicken skin. Finished it within 2 mins, will definitely be ordering this again. So impressed!!!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I'd rate them 1 star but because they were new, I'll be generous here. Also, coming from SEA myself I know i can be a tough judge.

My friends and I came on a weekday night for dinner. Tables were fully reserved so we were seated by the bar. We were hungry and very excited for some South East Asian food. We ordered quiet a bit of food on the menu. Decor was cute btw.

We ordered Thai Apple Salad , Jackpot Chicken (duh), Fire Roasted Chicken, Schmaltzy Rice, and Shrimp Toast with Laksa Sauce. 

So the verdict?

$8 for the Thai Apple Salad, served in a dessert bowl. It was okay, nothing fantastic however the portion was so small for its price.  

Shrimp Toast with Laksa Sauce was served second. Now when it came, it wasn't what we were expecting at all. Mind you, it was placed under the \"Large Plates\" section, so you would expect it to fill you up right? Sorry, there were 8 tiny pieces of shrimp toast. They were delicious but it was way overpriced. Laksa sauce? Meh that wasn't laksa sauce. 

*30 minutes later*
The owner? asked if everything was okay and if we wanted our bills. We told him we were still waiting for our mains.

*45 minutes later*
We were asked again! Did you see us eating chickens and rice? SMH.

Out of nowhere, they brought out Crispy Chicken Skins and Soy Sauce Eggs, without saying anything or whatsoever. So we had to wave the owner? down to him we didn't order any of it. He told us its on the house. Thanks? The crispy chicken skins were as expected, crispy and delicious. The eggs were good too but it was way too salty for my liking. 

*1 hour* 

The chickens and rice finally came!!
The jackpot chicken tasted nothing like a traditional Hainanese chicken rice. It reminded me of Shanghai drunken chicken. I think they should rewrite the description of the menu. As for the fire roasted chicken, again, it was not what I'd expect from a South East Asian food joint. We were very disappointed.

Just as we were about to get the bill, the owner? came to us and said we'll get to eat desserts on the house. So we got everything on the dessert menu, Kaya French Toast and Pandan Madeleines. 

*20 minutes later*

Abundance of pandan madeleines. Yay because i love pandan everything.
Honestly these two on the menu were the only thing that was worth the order. They were really good and I'd definitely come back just to eat them. 

So all in all, this place did not live up to my expectations of SEA food and everything was kind of overpriced. We were there for almost 2 hours! Lots of waiting and disappointment, not a great dining experience IMO."}
{"text":"Quite liked the hainan chicken but I wouldn't say it's authentic compared to what I've had in asia. It was also on the pricier side as well, but everything was pretty tasty"}
{"text":"Jackpot chicken rice is meant to be a Singaporean style chicken rice and really only has the two different chicken options on the menu. I thought the chicken was pretty good, with a very tasty rice, but on the oilier side. I'd say it's worth a try, but probably not something I'd keep wanting to come back to. Skip the crispy skin, not really worth the extra money."}
{"text":"I had a nice time, the service was really attentive, though it was not busy as it had just began to snow quite hard and no one was out and about. Chicken rice was good, I thought the price was higher than I would have paid at a normal chicken rice place but it was high quality, hormone free chicken, and the service/cleanliness is nice. Portions were fine. I was bursting at the seams after eating the chicken rice plate + soup, so I have no idea how much y'all who were complaining, are eating. Though, looking at everyone's photos, both my partner's and my portion were much more generous than many of the photos. Sure, in comparison to my Singaporean place at home, yeah, it's less food, but the rice is schmaltzier, a little heavier. 

More importantly, modest portions leave room for dessert, which though someone complained about \"pureness\" re: Kaya french toast, it was delicious. I don't see a problem with making kaya toast into a new thing. 

I admit that as a visitor, the exchange rate favors me greatly, so the prices didn't seem unreasonable. I thought the colander lamps were fun, creative. Surprised how much everyone seems to dislike the place, but I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"We visited Jackpot chicken on the weekend. They were pretty busy. Their signature Jackpot Chicken is the traditional Hainanese Chicken. I believe the broth they get from poaching the chicken is used in the soup they serve. It's very oily. We also ordered the fire roasted chicken, crispy chicken skin and killa prawns. I would say that prawns were the best, followed by the chicken skin. Both chickens were ok, nothing to rave about - and not worth the price tag. They de-boned the chicken! (Traditionally, they don't generally do this) They're bringing chinese/singaporean food to Toronto at western prices and western ways.  
The waiters and waitresses are absolutely amazing - very friendly, and very helpful. Their decor is nice inside, but i'm not sure if it's worth the mark-up in food prices especially since you can walk down the street for the same thing, in a not-so-fancy looking place but pay half the amount. It's worth a try though!"}
{"text":"To be fair, we've been to Singapore to eat Hainanese Chicken Rice where it is absolutely amazing how it can be so good for only a few dollars. 

Coming to Eat Jackpot, we put aside our past experiences in Singapore and even the ever so popular Hainanese Chicken Rice at Phoenix Restaurant that is really good in order to evaluate this restaurant fairly.

We started with the Foie Gras and Duck Confit Potstickers. 5 of these potstickers came in at $13 so we expected them to be plump, juicy and filled with flavour. Instead we got the saddest looking potstickers I have ever eaten that had no flavour whatsoever. There was barely any meat, a little bit of vegetables and they were so dry. The server even commented that these were her absolute favourite. We were off to a bad start...

Next came up the Hanoi Pork Neck for $18. To be honest, I had no idea what flavour to expect as it's kind of strange to call something \"Hanoi\". The dish came and it was again very dry and didn't have any flavour. One good thing is that it came with two large slabs of pork neck that were sliced so at least we got some value.

Finally the dish we came for, the Jackpot Chicken ($16) or Hainanese poached chicken with \"Schmaltzy Rice\" ($6) arrived. We tried the rice first and it was very fragrant and tasty and I was happy to pay $6 for rice that usually comes with the dish. The chicken was cooked well and was moist but it came cold. I sent this dish back only saying it was cold and when it came back \"freshly\" made, it was again cold! I gave up at this point and decided that I should just settle the bill and fill my stomach at Nguyen Hoang next door that never disappoints."}
{"text":"I find the quality of food great, but the price and service could be improved.  I called twice to place a takeout order, no one answered.  When I was there with friends, the waitress never came around after serving us our orders.  Stick to walking in and placing a take out order."}
{"text":"Was introduced to this place by a close friend. 

Ordered the poached hainanese-style with traditional soft skin, ginger-scallion and chilli sauce chicken and man was it amazing. 

The service was spot on and the food was absolutely amazing. Super delicious, tender chicken served with rice. 

Get on it. So damn good!"}
{"text":"the positives.... surprisingly the wintermelon soup was a favourite!! and the crispy chicken skins and the super aromatic rice (that gets served to u in an oh so adorable little bucket), all those are good things..... but like other ppl have mentioned the chicken is only \"okay\". seriously, hk cafes up north of the city do it way better for way cheaper BUT jackpot is a super fun experience and impressive cool chic date place. LOVED being here on a saturday night, all good vibes, GREAT music (were talking r kelly, ja rule, ashanti, ludacris level songsssss!!!) and great friendly fun servers. easygoing place with adorable decor is fun (for small groups or dates.... you'll be waiting forever if you're planning to have a big bday dinner here or something)..... but again, for a place CALLED Jackpot Chicken, i expected the chicken to actually be the star, but the atmosphere was def the best part of the night (which i didn't mind anyway)"}
{"text":"I give this a 3.5, but couldn't figure out how to do the half star ;)

We had the special scallop ceviche (3.8/5), pot stickers (3/5), jackpot chicken (4.5/5) and rice. We also ordered the crispy chicken skins, but at 9:30 PM that was not an option for the kitchen, so instead we got the coconut+shrimp chips (3.7/10).

The scallop ceviche was great, but it was 95% watermelon and very light on scallops ;) The pot stickers were really yummy, but a little too heavy on the mayo for my liking. That or the mayo was too flavourful. Either way, too mayo-strong. The jackpot chicken was great, and the scallion/garlic sauce it's served with is AMAZING. I personally didn't have the rice, but my boyfriend quite liked it :)

Service was decent, clean-up was quick, and the bill was reasonable. Cool space, perfect level of lighting on a Saturday night, not too loud, and not crazy busy. The tables are close to one another but it still felt intimate and not crowded. 

Drink menu is also decent - lots of local stuff for the beer lovers, and fun fusion cocktails."}
{"text":"Never again would i waste my calories here.

Hostess - won't seat me as a single diner while there was someone waiting for takeout at the high table by the bar. Won't seat me at the high table with six stools. No reservations, not a communal place I guess even though it looks hipster casual. Made me wait for the couple at the bar to get their bill. Should have went with my gut and left at that point. 

Service - my waitress was fine. Just turned off by the hostess. 

Basically I agree with Eric C with the meal.

Chicken - meh. Rice - like Eric C said it wasn't the authentic. Not the rice, not the sauces. My meal felt like it came from the microwave. My meal wasn't even hot. Not even the crispy chicken skin, it was warm at most but one was on the cooler than room temperature. It was just oily and one bite was crunchy. It was just garbage. Soup - like Eric C said, it felt like it was out of a can and they threw in some fried garlic from a box and they didn't even fry it. The whole thing was off. 

I've paid for cheap street eats in Asia for good chicken rice. I've also had $$$ chicken rice after Singapore F1 night race at a regular restaurant. This was like Halloween Hainan chicken rice, it looks decent, but it's not a yummy dish at all. 
 
Ballsy for Jackpot to open in Chinatown. Fooled me once! Never aga"}
{"text":"It was just okay.

The place is decorated very nicely, and they played hip hop which was nice, but the food wasn't anything to write home about. We ordered the High Roller Noodles and the Jackpot Chicken.

The noodles came to us not hot; they weren't even that warm. Also, once you dismantle the thing, you realize the portion size is small for what it costs. The flavours were nice though, and the crispy tofu, pork, and shrimp were yummy. 

The Jackpot Chicken was also just okay. Wasn't very flavourful."}
{"text":"I was expecting a lot less based on these reviews, but was pleasantly surprised. The meal itself definitely stemmed from a vision of fusion cuisine - a twist on classic dishes to keep things interesting. And overall, as a group of 4 girls who visited on a Tuesday evening, it worked for us, and we didn't find the food too bad at all.

Located right by Spadina Road and Dundas Street West (and not too far away from Kensington Market), we opted for the \"Go All In\" menu package (good for 4 guests), which includes 3 snacks and 3 large plates (which also came with rice, eggs, and soup) for $115. We had the soy sauce eggs, crispy chicken skins, kaffir broccoli tempura, jackpot chicken, fire-roasted chicken, schmaltzy rice, among other dishes (yes... we were hungry lol).

Overall, we actually quite enjoyed the schmaltzy rice and the snacks that came with our meal. The rice seems to be cooked in a chicken stock or something similar because it was super flavourful without being soggy. The actual chicken itself was fine but wasn't my favourite - it was a little too moist for me to enjoy. However, while the chicken wasn't the best, everything else was quite tasty (although, for a restaurant called Jackpot CHICKEN, you'd think the chicken would be the highlight - but it wasn't).

Not a bad spot for a group dinner or casual date - atmosphere is colourful and quirky, and the music was 90's hip hop in the best way possible. We would come back here again!"}
{"text":"My dining companion had just returned from Singapore and was curious to see how Jackpot Chicken Rice stacked up against the similar fare he ate over there, so we showed up at around noon on a chilly winter day.

Of course, if you're at a restaurant and they have a dish of that same name, it would be silly to order anything else. Indeed, we both ordered the Jackpot Chicken Rice (\"Tender boneless poached chicken, Hainanese-style, with schmaltzy chicken rice, ginger-scallion, chilli sauces and winter melon soup\" and we also added the Crispy Skins to our individual orders).

The dish arrived shortly after and I have to say I was quite pleasantly surprised. My favorite aspect of the meal was the rice, as it was perfectly cooked and boasted a fairly irresistible chicken flavor. The chicken itself was also quite good, although there were quite a few inedible pieces (but then again, that appears to be the style of this dish).

The two accompanying sauce were nothing short of magnificent, while the winter melon soup was refreshing and delicious. Oh, and of course the crispy chicken skins were amazing.

We closed out the meal with the Kaya French Toast, which was just about perfect. It arrived nice and toasty and the whole thing is impressively not too sweet, while the accompanying coconut ice cream is completely addictive.

I should finally note that my dining companion, who ate Chicken Rice whilst on his travels, said that the version here compares very closely to the real deal."}
{"text":"Hainanese chicken rice has existed in Toronto for a while now, but no one has been perfecting it. Jackpot Chicken Rice picks up the location where Lucky Red was, and is attempting to bring authentic chicken rice into the heart of Chinatown. This was my experience. 

It was surprising stepping into a restaurant that was previously nicely decorated, and I'm glad to see that Jackpot Chicken Rice carried that authentic look to their restaurant. The place was bustling when we visited for Sunday lunch. We got to choose our own seats, while we starred at the mural of the baby with the giant watermelon. Service was friendly and interactive, waitresses were kind and eager to answer any question we had of the establishment. Water was poured consistently, and the general smoothness of the service was nice. 

We ordered the two traditional dishes, chicken rice with soft skin, and chicken rice with crispy skin. The dish comes with a soup (presumably made from carcass of the chicken), the chicken and chicken flavoured rice, and 2 different condiments, scallion ginger sauce, and chilli sauce. The melon soup was great, and had that authentic chicken broth taste from boiling with traditional Asian spices. The chicken was cooked nicely as well, the skin both gelatinous and soft, similar to the classic style of Hainanese chicken. The condiments were also presumably made fresh, which added freshness to the dish when combined with the rice. The coriander did nothing for me though..and frankly looked a bit stale, even if it is for presentation.

The reason that this review is 3 star is simply because of the pricing of the dishes. For what is basically 1/4th of a chicken and rice, it came out to be $20 per person. The portion size does not justify that price range, and it's clear that most of the Yelpers agree. It's a shame, considering this was the closest representation to that classic chicken rice dish to date. So if you can get over the pricing, you'll have no problems coming back.

I'll probably come back to sample the other dishes. Recommended."}
{"text":"Not as good as it's advertised. Dishes are over priced. The Jackpot chicken doesn't taste any special than the boiled chicken we can easily make at home. I'm not convinced."}
{"text":"So on the second visit, this place turned out to be a massive disappointment.

On the first visit, they had the right and authentic dark sauce.

On the second visit, they had sweet black sauce on the table; the other option was light soy sauce.

When I asked for the other dark sauce, I was told by snide waitress lady that \"the chef says this is all we have\".

Well then.

This place is literally next door to Oriental Harvest (an Asian grocery store with like, ten brands at least of the right sauce). Jackpot has zero excuse. 

Anyway. Don't bother with this place, if looking for authentic chicken rice - Jackpot is just another poser in the city.

And what on god's green earth is \"French Kaya Toast\". For the love of all things good and pure."}
{"text":"I have never written a Yelp review before , but because of this restaurant I decided to write my first one.  For starters, it took one and half hours to get 2 eggs, I don't understand why slicing eggs takes this long.  The food came out in 20 minute intervals, and they came out cold.  The winter melon soup tasted like chicken broth and the strangest thing is that the soup itself is hot while the winter melon is cold. We came here for the Hainanese chicken, which I think is supposedly their highlighted dish, but the chicken is so bland.  At the end of our meal the manager finally came to talk to us because he noticed we were not happy about the service, to tell us that they were training staff.  Thanks for telling us after 2 hours.  They should tell their customers what to expect, not give an apology when they have wasted their time.
At the end of the day , my review of this place is bad service, bad food, and high prices.  I will give them that they have a nice atmosphere, but I'm not pay $40 for aesthetics.  We will never come back again.  It was one of the worst experiences I can remember."}
{"text":"Is anybody going to address the crazy prices? We dined here because we were hearing all the buzz about the hainanese chicken rice. First of all, the menu itself doesn't even offer hainanese chicken rice altogether as one item. You have to order it seperately as individual items. $16 for chicken alone (medium sized portion, enough for 1 person. salty, boneless, below average 3/10 chicken) $11 for 2 SMALL bowls of rice (rice was good. just good) additional $$ for soup, additional $$ for eggs and additional $$ for crispy chicken skin amongst other appetizers. We chose the $70 for 2 deal which includes 2 appetizers and 2 entrees. After tax and tips it came out to roughly $90 altogether. To break that down for you... $45 for a below average plate of hainanese chicken rice. Feels like we got scammed... this is way too overpriced and not worth visiting. The server even had the nerve to tell us that it was a great deal! Does $45 for a plate of chicken rice look like a great deal to you?! I'm speechless."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time on May 6 (a Saturday). Glad I made reservations as it was already full when we arrived. We got a seat in the very back, the music was pretty loud.

We ordered the jackpot chicken ($16) + schmaltzy rice ($6) + Magic Ramen ($15, secret item, must order before 6:30pm).

Ok, so in short: 

FOOD - the chicken was great and super tender, but quite honestly the ramen was.... typical ramen. It wasn't anything special. 

SERVICE/STAFF - great attention. My water cup was always full. The manager Andrew is awesome and took the time to check up on us at least twice. 

PRICE - For the portion rec'd, the price was a bit much. I think I would have been happy (and a returning customer) if the chicken dish was like $12-14, for that size. Plus it sucked that they didn't include rice, since that dish could not be eaten without rice. So they knew that you'd have to order a $6 specialty rice (which was great), but I could have enjoyed it just the same with white rice included with the dish.

Overall, I would recommend this place for the awesome and dedicated service and the food does taste good. However, with that said, it wouldn't be my go-to since Hainanese chicken can be found in almost all Chinese restaurants at a cheaper price. But it was fun! I had a great experience!"}
{"text":"very disappointing! 

ordered the snack jackpot chicken rice with poached chicken, and add-on egg and fois gras... portion is tiny.. soup is bland, fois gras and rice are too greasy, and everything is lacking complexity in seasoning/flavors.. yet was paying $27 for such \"snack\"... overpriced is an understatement.."}
{"text":"It's way too overpriced. It's not a good place to go if you go by yourself. It's better if you go with more than 2 people because the menu options are mostly for groups of people. I ordered the Jackpot chicken and a dish of rice for $22 and plus tips. I've been other place that sell the same thing and it's much cheaper.It's good for 1 time experience. But i won't go back."}
{"text":"I'm kind of surprised of the lower rating for Jackpot since I had a great dinner service last week. The moment you step in, you're greeted with a trendy/bright ambiance and unique décor (in particular their lights cover made with strainers). Most of the tables were reserved but luckily we were able to get the last table for 2- so do make a reservation ahead of time if you have a big group! 

We ordered the jackpot chicken ($16), the schmaltzy rice for 2 ($6), and the kaya toast ($7) for dessert. If you are hungry, this is probably not enough for 2 people. The jackpot chicken is a traditional Hainanese Chicken. It was tender and flavourful, and it went really well with the chilli sauce. The schmaltzy rice came in a wooden pot and was cooked perfectly. If you're trying this for the first time, you might find it oily in comparison to other rice - this is because the rice is cooked with chicken oil which makes it extremely flavourful! I'm a big fan of kaya (coconut jam) so I was delighted to find they serve it. It was delicious, but I wish they served the full French toast!  

Service was friendly, helpful and quick - another bonus. The only thing I would note might be the price...? Next time, we're going to try the 'Go All In' for 2 guests - which you can choose any 2 snacks and any 2 large plates with crispy skin, soy eggs, soup and schmaltzy rice, all for $70. It's a good deal to taste Jackpot's menu!"}
{"text":"First things first,  I loved the various decor touches throughout the restaurant! As for the food, I've always been a big fan of Hainanese chicken rice and Jackpot does a good job at executing this classic dish. The winter melon soup was a nice compliment given that the rice can be a bit too \"schmaltzy\". We also tried the off the menu ramen and of course, it was present nicely (for the gram!). I personally preferred the Jackpot Chicken rice more. The ramen was a bit spicy, served with shrimps, Chinese sausage, bean curd tofu and soy sauce soft boiled eggs. I don't think I would ever get it again. Overall, I enjoyed my experience but I must admit with my fellow Yelpers, a bit pricey since I've had the Hainanese chicken dish at various other restaurants."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from a couple of friends!! Because I'm a huge fan of Hainanese Chicken Rice. So when this place opened up, a few people told me about it - great job marketing!

Drive from Markham area downtown just to try.  

As soon as I walked in, I was already disappointed.

Hainanese Chicken is a traditional Malaysian dish found all over the streets of Malaysia.

This place specializing in this dish didn't have a single Malaysian person in the entire staff. Place was completely filled with non-Malaysian customers.  Only this high tables reminded me of authentic Malaysian street cuisine.

Because we came so far, we decided to wait 45 minutes for a table anyways. But looking at the food alone, we all knew it wasn't going to be good anyways. The Rice didn't have enough colour, the chilli sauce was not authentic.

I must say the service was really good and friendly! Well experienced start-up restaurant customer service and great start-up marketing.

Now onto the menu... glass of red is $10.50, bottle of beer is $5.95. Menu had 3 main course items only. Roasted Chicken, Hainanese Chicken, and Mushroom Tofu Rice. Main course is $13pp, comes with 4 pcs of chicken, and half of bowl of rice, and MSG melon soup. Their special of the day was double meat, with egg, and crispy chicken skin.

Onto the food experience of their specialty dish...chilli sauce is saracha sauce with a hint of grinded red chillis.. already disappointed.  Surprising the Rice did have Hainanese flavour.. but missing a lot of the distinct flavour. Rice was soggy.. cause it wasn't made with the authentic steps. Chicken was soft and over boiled.. it's not supposed to be boiled submerged in the pot, which is how I suspect it was prepared..

They used the same pot of Hainanese rice for their Roasted Chicken, and Tofu Chicken main courses.. flavour was not consistent through-out?!?

Highlight of the food was he crispy chicken skin..so it would be a must have if you ever visit.

I wouldn't say don't ever go here, but don't expect it to be authentic. A bunch of Canadians, who have never probably never had authentic Hainanese Chicken, run this restaurant. Totally disappo"}
{"text":"Probably the worst dinning experience l've had in the last 5 years; to be fair the staff were friendly and congenial. They seemed to know the food was off and were for the most part apologetic but the food took a long time to arrive. When it did: soup (winter melon) came in the middle of the meal. Some dishes were beyond salty (chicken skins, shrimp nuggets), e-fu noodles were over cooked and had a raw fishiness about them. The fried broccoli was nondescript. About the only thing that was good was the chicken rice. Even the Haianese chicken (which is what we came for) was average and a bit over priced. Super disappointed because a friend recommended this place but I will not be going back."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Singaporean food (having lived in Singapore) and had high expectations for this place. My party of 2 ordered: Jackpot Chicken, Sizzling Hamburg Okonomiyaki and a serving of rice. Meals are very filling and the chicken rice was excellent. I found the Okonomiyaki heavy on the sauce and drowned out some of the patty taste. 

While pricier for dinner, this Chicken rice is probably the best rice in town."}
{"text":"The hainan chicken rice was pretty authentic, and trust me it's hard to find a good hainan chicken rice place in downtown Toronto...but this place nailed it. The portions were kinda small. My friends and I went after a workout and I thought I wouldn't be full from the jackpot hainan chicken rice, but the portion was just right, and it came with a nice simple bowl of winter melon soup. The food took a bit of time, but it was worth the wait. Chicken was moist, perfectly seasoned, the rice was a bit softer than I expected but it was coated beautifully by the chicken broth. All in all, good spot for hainan chicken rice, and I will definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"We ordered the fire roasted chicken, the shrimp toast with Laksa sauce, the rice, and the chicken skin. The fire roasted chicken was delicious!! Crispy skin with moist meat. The rice was also very good, flavourful and paired well with the chicken. The shrimp toast was an interesting take on the dish but fell flat. It needed some spicy to compliment the rich coconut sauce. Lastly, the chicken skin was disappointing. A bit stail and extremely salty."}
{"text":"The only cool thing about this restaurant is the floating chopsticks ramen dish. But since they don't have that anymore, in my opinion I feel like it's not worth visiting. There's not much to eat on the menu. There's around 5 dishes to choose from and a few appetizers.  

I ordered the Thai apple salad and the jackpot chicken on rice. The Thai apple salad was pretty good. The flavour was nice and refreshing. But it's nothing wowing about it. 

As for the jackpot chicken on rice. The rice was pretty good. It has a ginger flavour to it. But the problem with the rice was, it was somewhat hard and it was not hot.  The chickens as okay. Not bad. But not really special either. The chicken was also not hot so it didn't not taste fresh. Additionally, the skin on the chicken was not plucked off properly.  There was chicken hair on the chicken skin. Similar, we got the additional crispy chicken skin. There was chicken hair left on it too. The crispy chicken skin is not worth getting for an additional $2 because it wasn't good. It was really oily.  

They gave us soup with our meal. But the soup was also room temperature... however, the table next to us received steaming hot soup.....

As for service, the servers are not attentive at all. They never looked at our table. So I had to walk up to the counter to pay. 

Overall, this place is not worth visiting. The food is not properly prepared. It's not hot or fresh and the service is not good.   

P.S. they weren't busy when we went"}
{"text":"Visited Jackpot this week with 2 friends.  Although the chicken and rice was good, three of the other dishes were inedible.  The crispy chicken skins and shrimp nuggets were too salty and the $27 lobster parmesan e-fu was overcooked and soggy.  One dish was sent back and two others we barely touched.  As I scanned around the room, I noticed a few other tables also had untouched dishes.
The wait staff were pleasant trying to deal with a slow kitchen.  But waiting 50 minutes for your food is unacceptable.  I don't have a problem with food delivery services, but restaurants should prioritize the orders of visiting patrons ahead of those placing orders on Foodora."}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant on a Saturday at around 2:30 in the afternoon. Service was prompt and courteous, we were greeted right away and seated in the middle of the restaurant.

The menu was very simple, they basically had 3 main dishes to offer: hainan chicken, roast chicken, and a tofu mushroom option. Customers can order these dishes in a meal size or snack size. I decided to try out the hainan chicken dish as \"meal\" size ($13.95) and roasted chicken as snack option ($9.75). It didn't take long for them to come out and the proportions were surprising (not in the pleasant way!). The meal was essentially the same size as the snack dish and was almost double the price!! 

Having tried these dishes at other Chinese shops, I'd say the taste and flavour was definitely there and tasted pretty good.  The roasted chicken was very tender as well. If you visit this shop, expect a few choices of chicken but nothing adventurous with this style of dish. 

Unfortunately I wouldn't come back though as this place was way too overpriced. Considering that they are located in the heart of Chinatown, there are far too many authentic and cheaper alternatives that I would rather visit."}
{"text":"The food was delicious.  We ordered the Jackpot Chicken which is their specialty.  However, being Asian we know Hainanese Chicken and Rice is \"poor\" people food.  Prices for this should be cheap.  Unfortunately not at this restaurant.  They are way overpriced...their lunch special is $13.99 for the Jackpot chicken and the portion sizes are really small.  As much as I enjoyed the food, I cannot justify the price and probably won't come back due to this.  There are other places in the neighborhood where you can get the same quality of food but more affordable."}
{"text":"Can I just say Foie gras!?!!?!?

My first time ever trying Foie Gras, and gosh almighty that stuff was amazing! Either this place really makes a kicker Foie Gras or its not hard to make lol. disclaimer :I don't know nor have a ever ventured off in the Foie Gras world but I must say it was the most delicious thing I have ever had.

All the dishes we ordered were simple but omitted so much amazing flavors with each bite. I would go here again but not as often as I would like to 1 because its far from home and 2 because its quite pricey.

Overall the place was great, the waitress was knowledgeable with the food on the menu and music was just the cherry on top of the cake, if your into hip hop and rnb a little bit of that good good old school then this is your place to be."}
{"text":"Can I please give 5 more stars to this restaurant? I have been putting off writing this review for 7 days because I simply don't know WHERE TO BEGIN. This meal has definitely made it to my life's Top 10 Meals.

I came here on a Friday night with 4 other friends. We didn't have a reservation so we waited at the bar for 20 minutes. 

We chose from the \"Go All In\" menu for the four of us and my vegeterian friend. It was more than enough for five perople. The highlight of my meal was the ricee. It was blended with heavenly spices that made it taste so rich. The jackpot chicken itself was super tender. 

Our server, proactively brought us an appetizer on the house when he explained that the kitchen was backlogged and he was speculating that our foods will be served late. We didn't even have to wait for our meals the appetizers were so good."}
{"text":"I went to Jackpot when it first opened up and there were a few growing pains; for example they forgot my sauces (the chicken was still amazing though).

I went back again and they have changed. service is smoother, the menu makes more sense and the food tastes better! 

I've had Hainanese Chicken in Singapore and this tastes just as good to me if not better.

i suppose it's a bit pricey, but i think it's worth it. I'd definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Chicken rice is good. The restaurant gives you a hipster feel to your traditional Hainanese chicken rice.  Be ready to pay for the hipsterness of the decor."}
{"text":"This place is a pleasant find for me on Spadina. The menu has some nice choices of chicken and hamburger, done Asian style. Snack dishes were delicious too especially the pot stickers. My favourite dish is the roast chicken. Also good selection of cocktails and beer. Service is friendly, knowledgeable and fast. I visited three times in the last 10 days so obviously I like this spot quite a bit."}
{"text":"- I loved the decor and ambience.
- My hostess/server was Aimee and she was fantastic. Very engaging and made the experience amazing.
- I ordered the Jackpot Chicken and rice. Growing up in a Chinese home, I have had this dish many times. I would say this was the best one I've had yet. 
The soup and crispy chicken skin was also very tasty. I highly recommend them.
- I will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"I visited Jackpot Chicken Rice for lunch and have mixed feelings about it

The restaurant is decorated nicely and I like the fact that you can see the kitchen in action if you sit at the chef's counter.

Looking at the menu, I thought the prices were a bit on the high side (it is lunch afterall!). The namesake meal is asking for $14 for chicken with rice and soup, and the server convinced me that the $2 crispy skin add-on is \"very popular and totally worth it\", so that's already $16 before tax and tip.

The place was busy and it took a while for the food to come. The chicken and rice was luke warm, it didn't bother me but it might for some people. The chicken was delicious, very tender and absolutely picked clean of any bone, which made it a joy to eat. I did not enjoy the crispy skin - it did not add anything to the dish and was a total waste of money. 

I found the rice \"interesting\", perhaps it is common (?) for dishes like this to use fractured grains, but to me it made for an unsatisfying chew and it took away from the deliciousness of the chicken. I think that if they are charging good money for this dish, they could have used a better grade of rice.

Overall, I enjoyed eating the chicken despite not overly satisfied with the priced I paid. For anyone who are considering visiting, I would suggest skipping the crispy skin."}
{"text":"If possible, I would give it a 4.5

A small business in busy china town. Dropped by coz it was on the \"Best new restaurants 2017\" and wanted to try their food. I had the fire roasted chicken and  the chicken rice. 

Food: both dishes felt like \"home cooked food\" due to it being simple as chicken and rice. There is no extra fancy shmancy sauce for the chicken (just sambal glazed) and rice...made with chicken fat *drools*. Chicken was delicious, rice was very delicious! Left the restaurant feeling full!

Area/Service: the service area is relatively small to the huge chinese restaurants surround it. Majority of the tables can hold 4 people (and more if you merge tables). Due to the small size don't be surprise if you find it full and a line waiting (and yes the place is clean). Service is also prompt. Your food prep depends on 2 factors: the length of your order, and the amount of people in the restaurant.

Why the 4.5 and not 5? Well maybe it is subjective of me but I did feel the portion:price ratio did not balance. The Large plate is supposed to get half a chicken. When I got the dish I wondered what kind of small chicken did they have lol. Also I needed 2 portions of rice to match the chicken (there was more rice than chicken only coz i really wanted to try the rice being from a rice eating family).

Overall Positive experience, will definitely come back to try other dishes. Good place to meet friends and try different apps."}
{"text":"Located in chinatown on spadina, Ive walked pass this place for quite a few times, and the big blue sign has definitely caught my eye. And i give props to the interior. Cute decor. But I have to say, i would never come back again. 

What i ordered:
Lucky dice - chicken and rice, soft shell crab bao, shrimp cake, wintermelon soup
Oyster crepe
Shrimp toast with laksa sauce
Tiger beer

Everything i ordered was not worth the price, in my opinion. The only good thing was the beer. Server did a good job explaining the menu. They have share dishes and solo dishes. Portions were small consider what i was paying. The lucky dice ($39) was meant for two people. But id say its an appetizer that consist of two of each item. And the shrimp cake included was disgustingly salty. I told my server but she didnt ask if i want a substitution or offered anything if i didnt like it. She was like \"yea its like that, maybe a little salty today\". Well I shouldnt have to eat unbearable salty food and harm my health cuz you decide to make it saltier today?! 

Terrible food. Some are too salty, some are tasteless. I was starving after this $120 lunch. Cant even say they serve authentic Singaporean food. Sorry i got too disappointed and forgot to take pictures for the rest of the food. On the one day i decided to not yelp and be adventurous....."}
{"text":"Giving them 4 stars for creativity with their food. Taste is so so..like so close from being amazing but above average for sure. Service and ambience are great..totally trendy cute place."}
{"text":"Afte reading the reviews and having someone recommend this restaurant I had high expectations of Jackpot Chicken Rice.
The atmosphere and service were good, however the chicken wasn't good at all. The food is greasy and left me with a bad feeling after dinner. If you like greasy Chinese food this is the place for you. I was expecting a higher quality of food for the price."}
{"text":"Do you like fatty, gelatinous, lukewarm chicken? Do you like toothsome, leathery, overlooked pork jowl? Do you like coming to the resto only to find two menu items aren't available and a third from the website is missing? The knock-out schmaltzy rice doesn't make up for never receiving the crispy skin or the soy egg, let alone the state of the entrées."}
{"text":"2.5 is my rating.
This was quite disappointing. Understanding this place is owned by Patois, I was hoping it would have nice twists to their food items...

I tried the Triple Seven ($21)
This was essentially their specialized jackpot chicken rice but double the chicken, served with crispy skin and a soy egg. The portion was small - there was very little rice. Considering there were double the chicken, you would think the rice would be double too? Poor ratio on chicken and rice. The fact that they served the chicken over the rice made the rice soggy, without its slight crisp. The chicken was not flavorful and relied strictly on the sauce. The crispy skin was super crispy would was great, but it was overly salty. As for the soy egg, I really have no idea why it was there and what value it added as it was not relevant nor complimented the dish at all. On their menu they also have the option of adding foie gras to your chicken rice - I have no idea how that works in terms of how the flavors would fit but didn't sound attractive to me at all. I gotta say I was expecting some kind of twist to this asian dish, but nope, it was quite standard and in fact I've had better at other chinese restaurants. 

Kaffir Broccoli Tempura ($6)
Apparently this was a recommended dish, but it was nothing special. Deep fried broccoli topped with mayo. It was good that the batter wasn't thick like Japanese restaurants, but really nothing special with this dish.

I like the decor of the place - has that Patois vibe but really not feeling the food. Don't see any reason coming back."}
{"text":"I was surprised by their decor... very colourful and to me it was very obvious that they were trying to be authentic yet trendy (Exhibit 1: colanders hanging from the ceiling)

I came here in the first week of opening and their menu was pretty small... don't know if that's changed. I got the Hainanese chicken rice and it was tasty. Seemed a bit overpriced though- for $15, we got a small helping of chicken, a bit of rice and a small bowl of soup. Since this is located in Chinatown where there are tons of cheap food options.. I'm not sure how well this restaurant will do. Service was pleasant though."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this place for a while!  I loved Patois... Since it was a late working night in the office I decide to splurge.  $28 got me food to my office, fire roasted chicken and half a cup of soup (basically two shots of soup since it has spilled during the delivery).

The chicken and rice was very tasty,  cold from the delivery but I can't complain given it was terribly cold out.  I do suggest better takeaway packaging--cold food and half a cup of soup for $28 is a bit much...

I had no expectations of how the meal was going to taste but it was definitely tasty; the soya egg which I ordered an extra one was good but too salty IMO.  What was left of the soup--very yummy, wished I had more!  Delivery was definitely not worth it but it did give me a taste that will send me to Jackpot Rice in person"}
{"text":"I like this place a lot! Ok the hainanese chicken isn't the best I've ever had, but the restaurant atmosphere is great and the other dishes we ordered were pretty decent. Fresh coconuts were actually so sweet and fresh and I really enjoyed the kaya toast. 

I forgot the name of the pictured dish but it was fried turnip and Filipino sausages.. delicious !"}
{"text":"Originally, my friends and I were supposed to go as a group of four to try out the $110 for 4 on the menu. We ended up going as a group of  three.

First off, atmosphere was nice. Definitely not a typical chinese ambiance. i later found out the owner of patois opened this place up. Trap music was bumping while we were there and we ordered the Thai apple salad, tempure broccoli and chicken skin as the appys--winter melon soup being a complimentary add on.
We also ordered the Hainan chicken (jack pot chicken, fire roasted chikcen and the Hanoi pork jowl.

First off, we ordered off the for 4 menu and our server decided to only punch in a serving for 3. Paying 110 for 3..? We later spoke with the manager which she apologized for and brought out the missing serving.

Once the food arrived, we realised the portions were very small. We'll just say the 3 of us ate everything no problem. Coming from chinese decent, having eatten at a lot of chinese restaurants in regards to the portion size--the food was 100% overpriced. Food was below average. The one true season all the dishes had was salt, especially the pork jowl.

It is worth the experience but the for food, it was average to say the least"}
{"text":"Had a fabulous time at Jackpot! Menu is short and sweet, because you are there for chicken rice, of course. Both the traditional chicken rice and the roast chicken rice were very well prepared, with flavorful chicken and nicely schmaltzed rice. You MUST add the crispy skin. Not negotiable. I will be dreaming about the crispy skin for months. My partner got the secret menu ramen, which has the very best presentation, ever, of ramen. Cocktails were also well executed: our group got the Manhattan, the Negroni and the special watermelon drink, all of which had a little spin on them to make them Chinatown worthy. All in all, a terrific visit. We will be back."}
{"text":"Got delivery via foodora for two Jackpot chicken mains. The total came out to be 18 dollars each. The portions are so ridiculously small. Maybe the portions are bigger when  you dine in, but avoid this place at all costs for delivery"}
{"text":"The Jackpot Chicken Rice was amazing.

My girlfriend and I checked Yelp pictures before we came here, and we were expecting a \"small portion, good food, but pricey\" experience. 

We ordered the Triple 7 with Jackpot chicken, and another single order of the Jackpot chicken rice. We actually ended up being really full, surprisingly.

I would definitely recommend people to go if they want some good Hainanese chicken rice! Totally worth it."}
{"text":"Bleh. Chicken was poorly seasoned, rice was not as flavourful as it should have been, and the sauces were inauthentic. I've been eating Hainanese chicken since I was in elementary school; this isn't how it's supposed to taste. Also, the portions were small for the price. I did like the melon soup, though."}
{"text":"Service:
My server ignored me a few times, but after that the service was quick and speedy. They'll  checkup on your table every so often. 

Ambiance:
It has a really hipster decor, and it's good to go with small group of friends.

Food:
The price of the dishes aren't expensive, but the portion size you get I feel should be closer to three $$$. If it's your first time going there, you have to get the Hainanese chicken as that's their main dish. It's a really famous Singaporean dish. The components of the dish does remind me of Singapore, as the chicken was cut to be boneless, the flavour profile was there, and the rice was pretty good. It was only missing the sweet soy sauce that you usually get. It wasn't the best Hainanese chicken that I ever had, but it's decent for the convenience of downtown."}
{"text":"After finally seeing all the Instagram pics I finally got to try this place.  The food is good and the flying ramen is a great way to get people to come In and eat here but to be honest the prices are overpriced.

As an Asian person getting hianese chicken is super cheap at the Chinese food court and it tastes the same or better.

Service was great but it's a place you try once, I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I really like the food. The chicken was pretty tasty and perfectly cooked (tender). Other reviewers had complained about the relatively small portion. That, I concur. Chinese places always undercook their chicken, but not this place. Btw, The fried chicken skin were divine. Next time I will eat in and enjoy their cocktails."}
{"text":"We made a reservation for two on a Friday night. I'd recommend going somewhere else in Chinatown for the same food, but half the price. The menu is set up with appetizers and mains that are meant to be shared. Rice is ordered separately. We ordered the Jack pot chicken and the pork belly with the jackpot rice. The food was okay, but I can't justify the price ($50 for two) with all the restaurants within a 5 minute walk."}
{"text":"I had read about this place in Toronto life and we were in neighborhood.  I was immediately greeted by a smiling face.  The menu offers an all in option which gives you the opportunity to try a bit of everything for a great price.  Everything was delicious but the standouts for us were the fire roasted chicken and soup.  My stepdaughter is a picky eater and she gobbled everything up.  As a parent u know if your kids eat it then it's good.  Kids are the hardest markers.  Cocktails are awesome and cool beer selection.  We can't wait to go back with whole family."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, the food was great and servers were friendly, but the portions were so small for that price. I'd much rather go to my usual spots for cheaper alternatives and knowing I wasn't ripped off.

If you got money to spend and don't eat much, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Not traditional authentic Hainan Chicken Rice, but still good taste. Roast chicken is really good, should have a try. The environment is interesting and the service is good. Will recommend if people drop by to Chinatown."}
{"text":"This place has quickly become one of our favorites in Toronto. Helmed by the uber creative, spunky team behind Patois, Jackpot Chicken is a place you go for casual Chicken Rice 'comfort lunch' and leave 3 cocktails later. 

Cocktail wise, the Hibiscus Negroni is killer, one of my top 5 Negronis ever (right up there with Byblos). The Tempest was refreshing with a nice bite. The 5-Spice Old Fashioned was average, stick to the more fun drinks here. 

Starters/Snacks, definitely don't miss the broccoli tempura, it's absolutely killer and light. The potstickers were good, the curry sauce makes the dish. 

Chicken wise, get the triple 7 and thank me later. You're going to want the extra chicken and the crispy chicken skin. Pro tip? Place a piece of chicken on the chicken skin, and top with the sauces (chili and the ginger/scallion \"green gold\"). Bite of the day, every time. The winter melon soup is nice and light especially after loading up on the chili sauce. Don't bother using a spoon, just slurp right out of the bowl, if you've read above you'll realize this isn't the type of place that judges. 

Great drinks, eats and people... TRUST FAM!

PS how this place had 3 stars or so at the time of this review is freaking mind blowing. I don't often leave reviews but damn a rating that off made me get busy!"}
{"text":"Not bad for a modern Chinese restaurant. The cocktails are innovative but mediocre and the restaurant itself was super casual. Had the sugar cane and garlic chicken wings, which were a daily special. It wasn't crazy amazing but it was good. Then the star, jackpot chicken came its way, with the rice for 2. The chicken was good and comparable to an authentic Chinese restaurant. The rice had an amazing texture and tasted like it was cooked in some kind of stock. The rice was definitely the highlight but it was a little salty. Anyways, this place is a definite try but I wouldn't go again. It wasn't bad but if you want hinanese chicken.... go to any of the Chinese restaurants in Chinatown! They're just as good, if not better!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a new twist on classics - give it a try.

But if you're looking for a good traditional Hainan chicken and other standard dishes... skip this.

There are positives: atmosphere & vibe, and the service are good. But everything else leaves this Hong Kong girl (and her friends) wanting.  If you're not familiar with traditional Chinese fare - you'd probably enjoy the offerings here a lot more than we did.

ATMOSPHERE: Lively, bright and colourful space.  As with many trendy locations, the dining room is small. Be prepared to squeeze in next to your neighbour.  And expect to run out of table-top space for your food.  (Everything is served on platters & you eat off plates rather than bowls - so really no space)  It'll get loud in here as the night goes on...

SERVICE: Great service! Friendly staff answering questions for new patrons, and giving suggestions on what to try.

PRICE:  Mid-range. For Chinese food, this is not cheap. Portions are smaller than most Chinese restaurants. However, it's reasonable for dining out for supper at a trendy spot.

FOOD:  Overall, fun to try. As I mentioned though, those who grew up eating Chinese food regularly may not enjoy the food here as much as those who have only been introduced or first-timers to this cuisine (and therefore, less traditional expectations). 

Our party of 3 wanted to try a bit of everything.  So we ordered the Triple 7 with Jackpot Chicken, with an extra side of rice (as our server recommended), and greens.

The Triple 7 was tasty: The chicken was moist, the soy egg was good, but the crispy skin was much too oily (one bite was all we could stomach - such a waste; been to other places that do it well).  There was too little rice and soup.  If the Triple 7 is meant to be shared - then it'd be nice to provide sizeable soup and rice.  There was enough chicken to go around - but not enough rice.  Otherwise, taste of soup and rice (though, a bit on the moist side...) had good flavour.

The Asian greens (aka. baby bok choy) were the biggest disappointment.  The menu did not say they were served chilled!  And those who know Chinese cuisine knows greens are usually steamed or stir-fried and served HOT.  We would not have ordered it if we knew it was cold.  Thought it was a miss to not have stated that clearly on the menu.  The dish was also really small (again, compared to typical portions at Chinese restaurants).

In general, if you like trendy & lively new place - check it out. But if you just want good Hainanese chicken? Plenty of more authentic spots around... granted, not as \"cool\" or hyped - depends on the type of experience you're in the mood for."}
{"text":"Finally came here after wanting to try this place for close to a year - the menu isn't conducive to trying the place solo for dinner, which is my preferred way of trying new restaurants; you have to come here with at least one other person to not only be able to try a few dishes and get a proper feel for the place, but to even have both chicken AND rice, because they are sold separately and in portions of 2. Blows my mind because Hainan chicken and rice is (and in my opinion should be) always sold together, in single portions.

The staff was super lovely - really sweet, attentive, welcoming people. That was the best part of my experience. 

We waited an absolute eternity for our food - about 45 minutes, on a Wednesday evening. We waited so long that our soft drinks went flat. The smell of food emanating from the kitchen was tantalizingly delicious, but I was getting pretty hangry after the first 20 minutes.

The wait would have been worth it if the food was good, which...it really was nothing special. The wintermelon soup was very nice and flavourful, and the chicken wasn't half bad, although if we're being sticklers, the chicken should have been plunged into cold water immediately after cooking so that the skin would be bouncier. But few places know to do that, so just going by flavour, those two things were nice enough. 

The stir-fried bok choy was alright and very garlicky, though the vegan XO sauce really seemed to cling to the back of my throat and made me cough. Plus I don't believe in vegan XO - XO sauce should always have dried scallops in it for that signature oomph. It packed quite a kick. But other than that, the veggies were okay, too - though very salty. 

I felt that the rice was tasty in a standard chicken rice way, but Superwoman suspected that there was a lot of MSG in it. I didn't get an MSG headache that night, though I was very thirsty after my meal - but that could have just been from sodium. Because the food here was all VERY, very salty. 

The chicken skin was kind of interesting - crispy and thin like a chip, but also very salty. I really liked the soy egg because it was flavourful AND medium-boiled, though it was a touch sweeter than I liked.

But the other small dishes/appetizers were terribly weak. The potstickers were wrapped into cute, flattened spheres, which looked nice but tasted awful because it meant that half the dumpling was basically squished-together wrapper - a solid chunk of carby dumpling wrapper. Not good. The filling was just basically a shrimp. It tasted kind of like a har gow (shrimp dumpling dimsum) but with half the dumpling being a solid block of carbs.

The shrimp toast was the worst. I love shrimp toast. I was initially delighted that the shrimp topping seemed to be mounted onto a fried Chinese cruller ( ??/???) cut lengthwise - how creative! - but it was not crispy at all. One of the most important things about shrimp toast is that it should be crispy. Instead, it was soggy, oily, and had no distinct shrimp flavour besides loads of salt. The laksa sauce and the lime juice served to distract a little bit from how dense and salty it was but good shrimp toast doesn't need anything. 

And then, of course, there was the price. $70 before tax and gratuity for the combo for two, and the portions were rather modest. Combined with the long, long wait and the lacklustre at best, awful at worst quality of the food, it was a very poor use of $90 in my opinion. Would not return."}
{"text":"Pretty good here! Not sure why this place has a subpar rating on yelp - probably because ppl are complaining about service.. which was really great when I went. I went here today for lunch and quite enjoyed the FOOD. My friend and I shared the \"lucky dice\" menu item. For $40, we got the jackpot chicken, 2 soft shell crab bao, shrimp nuggets, fries, the famous rice, wintermelon soup, and some veggies (cucumber and carrots).

Overall, I enjoyed the food. The jackpot chicken tasted amazing especially with that special lime(?) sauce that it's served with. It also tasted bomb with the sweet soy sauce you can ask for on the side. The rice was almost like a garlic rice (so yummy) and it paired really well with the chicken. The fries and the shrimp nuggets were decent and pretty good. The wintermelon soup was a little bland but I overall thought it was okay. The soft shell crab bao had me - this stuff is good - this is probably what pushed my review to a 4 from a 3.5. I know for sure I'm coming back here for the chicken, rice, and the soft shell bao. 

For $20 each, I feel like we somewhat got our money's worth. I would've liked it if there was more chicken as part of the lucky dice deal but I overall like how it had a good variety of everything they serve. I'd say the lucky dice is good for those new customers (like myself) who want to have a taste of a lot of what they offer. 

And the decor is cute - the light arrangements are made from painted plastic food covers"}
