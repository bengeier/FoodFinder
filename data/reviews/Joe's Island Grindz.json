{"text":"Kalua pig is buttery. Rice is sticky. Staff is friendly. Newly opened, but parking is decent. Variety of plate lunches and musubis."}
{"text":"5 Stars for Aloha in Las Vegas.  Tried the Joe's Special Bento.  Ono Mochiko Chicken, Chow Funn with Char Siu inside!  Ono Pork Hash, a good tasting Hot Dog (not just the cheap mystery meat kind), only thing the Teri beef was dry, maybe over cooked? Fresh steamed Manapua is back in Vegas...No more frozen kine from the drugstore. The Gracious Aloha Spirit is alive and well!  Going to miss them at this location. Retro Bleu is staying but Joe's is going to their own place 12/27/2017. Going to have to drive little farther now for Joe's Island Grindz."}
{"text":"We lived in Hawaii for two years and fell in love with the local food. Managua and pork hash we're always excellent on the island. Love the plate lunches as well.   So when we moved back we looked everywhere and nothing was as good. I found this place today on yelp and immediately went over. The wait was a big long but well worth it. The shoyu chicken is definitely excellent. The pork hash almost makes your toes curl it's so good and the char siu manapua were the bomb. Only things I didn't care for was the Mac salad but that's ok cause we are very satisfied with the food. Thank you so much!  Would have had picks of the other food but was to busy eating to take a picture."}
{"text":"Touch of Aloha is back!  If you recall it's old location on Losee and Lake Mead.  Best pork hash, chow fun and manapua.  The ohana spirit is back on the north side of town with great food with a local Hawaiian flavor!"}
{"text":"If you miss Hawaii and real LOCAL food, you bettah hele on ovah, brah!  Their pork hash is like da kine my Daddy would approve of, large generous portions of steamed ground pork with water chestnut and all the right seasonings in a two-bite bundle. Ask for the hot mustard and shoyu so you have the right dipping sauce. The manapua here is also huge--a hot, steamed bread blossom filled with traditional Chinese style BBQ pork.

On a Friday, I had their Hawaiian plate lunch special with laulau, kalua pork, poke, mac salad and steamed white rice. Oh my, it was enough to feed a family! Plenty leftover for dinner or breakfast. Makes me do a happy hula.

Also, the guys here hustle to get the orders in and out quickly and they are super nice, too.  When I mentioned I wanted the staff at hubby's business to try some, they gave me extra pork hash so everybody could have a taste.  Just so happy to have a place nearby that has ono (delicious) Hawaii home-style food!"}
{"text":"I am not the hugest fan of Hawaiian food, but sometimes when a craving hits you just have to give in. Enter Joe's, temporarily operating out of the Retro Bleu space in the CSN Commons through Tuesday. They have a limited menu of island specialties, including pork hash, manapua, and chowfun. But I came for the Spicy Ahi Nachos!

Spicy Ahi Nachos- a huge portion for $12, topped with avocado and spicy tuna garnished with spicy mayo sauce and furikake, all on a crunchy base similar to wonton strips with a salty-sweet flavor to them. They're addictive! But for the sake of knowing their range, I also tried the aforementioned hash and manapua, and both were solid. They're ending service in this location Tuesday but will be premiering service in their own location at the end of the month."}
{"text":"Best manapua in Vegas!!! We drove all the way here from South West just to try it out, they ran out of everything real quick especially the lau laus on Fridays. So we got manapua and porkhash, so worth the drive for these items but maybe once in a blue moon since they are sooooo far. would love to try their other dishes next time though. . . ."}
{"text":"Took me a while to find this place the other day but glad I did.  The big sign on the building was \"pineapple express\" which was funny.  Only gave three stars because the posted price on yelp and other sites for the manapua (which was very good, almost as good a Libby's in Kalihi).  Internet price is $2 but when you go here it's posted at $2.75--that's a .75 cent increase which is very high just for manapua.  Three guys running the place and they were very friendly and open to wala'au with the customers-good feeling.  Don't go by the yelp menu prices because they are so wrong.  I'll be back for the ono manapua sometime down the road but with the price it's a little to high for a constant buy."}
{"text":"The food is ONO!   The pork has is the BOMB!  Felt like I was home again.  

We ordered the pork has 2 days in a row, and of course we couldn't just have 1, we ordered 20 and they were gone. 

The chow fun was good too.  I'm so glad they are right around the corner from me!"}
{"text":"Went to try this place for the first time.  We ordered manapua, porkhash, Joe's special (bento with chow fun, porkhash, mochiko chicken, hot dog, BBQ beef), shoyu chicken.  One of the owners offered us a sample of their fried porkhash.  My shoyu chicken was almost perfect.  The chicken was super soft and nicely cooked but I prefer more shoyu flavor.  In all it was good enoughz"}
{"text":"Very good authentic food. The owner is a really nice guy as well. We will be back, its a pretty relaxed place they sever out of to go containers. Maybe after they are open for awhile they can bump up the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Omg!!! The best Hawaiian around! Love the pork hash!!! I will be back many times for more!"}
{"text":"I promised I would yelp a review, so here it is! I've lived in Vegas for over 20 years and I have seen Hawaii restaurants and plate lunch places come and go. I was excited when I found out that this place has pork hash and Manapua. My Dad used to buy it at Char hung sut and Libbys in Hawaii. Needless to say I haven't eaten pork hash in Vegas for nearly 15 years....only the ones in Chinese restaurants...bleh. Anyway, it exceeded my expectations. They were tasty and exploded with flavor. They are new in town, so give them the Aloha support they need!! I will try other items on menu soon."}
{"text":"Went in for the first time about a week ago and their air conditioner was not working. It was actually cooler outside in the 110 degree Vegas sun. It was horrible and i cant believe they actually stayed open and subjected their customers to that heat. I got a dozen manapua which cost me about $35. Nothing special and you could tell it was the frozen kine."}
{"text":"I would probably give the food a 3, but the service was really good here. The owner was very nice. Food was good. I was craving some saimen but I've had better than the bowl that I had here. I didn't like the noodles that they used and the broth could've had a little more flavor. I ended up adding soy sauce to the broth (I never have to do that). The pork hash is goood, they are huge! 

Kind of hard to find because the name of the restaurant is something else but there's a banner that says touch of aloha."}
{"text":"Almost missed this gem since their banner wasn't fully visible and their signage above the restaurant still read \"Pineapple Express\" so it was kind of confusing.  We parked and hesitated on going in because it looked closed (did not see an \"Open\" sign) but we chanced it anyways.  And let me tell you....I'm so glad we did...awesome and friendly customer service and the food was ono!!!...They have other delicious dishes on their menu but I only ordered the Pork Hash and Char Siu Manapua.  The pork hash dipped in hot mustard mixed with shoyu hit the spot and the manapua had just enough of everything.  The filling/dough ratio was perfect, bread...soft and delicious.  I would love for them to have more varieties of manapuas  in the near future (such as my fav..black sugar manapua!!).  I definitely recommend Touch of Aloha and I'm so glad they reopened and closer to my side of town!!!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the BEST Hawaiian restaurant in Vegas! They have pork hash, which no one has, and it's soo flavorful and delicious! They also have manapuas!! Not the little ones with the brown, dry pork inside either...nope, pink pork and it's moist and amazing! Their Bentos are gigantic and the mochiko chicken tastes great! Chow fun is also fantastic! Everything on their menu is great actually! I'm so happy they are back open again, we definitely missed their killer grindz!! Definitely the place to check out if you want ONO food!!! (Check out this huge bento!!)"}
{"text":"The manapua and the pork hash is what I purchase here reminds me of living in Hawaii, the Kalua Pig is awesome and always served with aloha"}
{"text":"So glad to see this place come back!! They have the best Hawaiian food in the valley for sure! You can't get pork hash anywhere, and there's is amazing! The bento's are also killer!! The chow fun is definitely ono!! We are so glad they are open in our neighborhood! We will definitely be eating here all the time! These folks are so nice and their food is incredible!!"}
{"text":"Just wanna say that im so glad i found this place. Even though i live on the other side of town i will definitely be a return customer again.

We decided to order a small order to sample. Had a small order chow funn, pork hash and manapua.

Let me tell you EVERYTHING we had was onolicious!!!! My favorite is the pork hash with some hot mustard and shoyu, auwe hit the spot! Plenty meat inside and real juicy and plenty taste. Call ahead to place an order they make it fresh!!!

Manapua was ono as well, filling was very tasty. Hoping they make some baked ones in future.

Chow funn another one hit the spot! Charsiu, veggies and the noodles. All so good.

Local people run this place from Hawaii (hence the name) real friendly and efficient. Will definitely be back again. Maybe a whole pan pork hash for myself next time. Still gotta try the plate lunches!

Mahalo plenty for satisfying this hungry hawaiian, searching high and low for bomb pork hash. Found it!!!!"}
{"text":"First of all looking for this place is confusing as hell. We found the address but no signage what so ever. We went in to see if this place even existed and we found out its two different entities. Retrobleu is the actual restaurant. They sell their food or dishes-how odd is that?

Anyways, we ordered according to the reviews on Yelp and it was a big disappointment. We went out of our way to find this place hoping it would deliver. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Ordered the butterfish, bento and loco moco ALL very good!  The butterfish was cut into good bite size pieces with a light batter that had a nice crisp.  If you crave fish and rice ... this'll do it!  The bento had a good sampling of chowfun, teri beef, mochiko chicken AND one bamboocha pork hash. That was a nice bonus to the bento.  The loco moco had the good kine gravy ... not the weak, pale cornstarch gelatin kine you get from some of those chain establishments.  

Besides the ono food the service was truly warm & welcoming.  Ten stars for the hospitality!!"}
{"text":"Their Loco Moco was bomb. Handmade angus patty and the gravy was really good too.

Friendly service. Oh yeah...get the pork hash too if it's not sold out yet.

Closed Monday though.

They used to be next door, but now they took the old pineapple express spot."}
{"text":"If you haven't ate Joe's food yet, you are missing out!! His hawaiian grindz are Delicious it reminds you of your childhood food from Hawaii.  He cooke it with love..  Go and check it out!!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Portions are big and prices are very reasonable. I mean 99 cent pork hash,  really? Yes! All the food tastes just like back home in Hawai'i. Seriously, go see Sam and the crew and CHOP!"}
{"text":"We have followed this restaurant since they were located on Lossee Street. We love the food and most of all the owners & staff! Thank you for the ono local foods!!"}
{"text":"The best authentic \"local style grinds\" in our 702. Whenever I'm missing the island food I enjoy being able to drive and fill our satisfaction. Just the right amount of flavor with the perfect \"touch of aloha\".my favorite ahi nachos is da bombdiggity and family devours it each time. Welcome back TOA!! We missed you"}
{"text":"Just like home! The three stars are mostly for \"portion\" size on the 2 choice which is more conservative then in Hawaii..and that it says Laulau on the menu but apparently it was only on Fridays (it didn't say that on the menu anywhere.. i was sad),  but other than that, everything was amazing! We got the Bento, 2 choice with Mochiko Chicken plate, 4 Manapua and 12 pork hash. It is advised to order the pork hash as soon as you get there as it takes about 15 minutes to cook.. or you can call ahead."}
{"text":"I have recently became a regualer here for two reasons... outstanding food and  excelent customer service! I would have to highly recommend eating at this establishment!! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is AhhhhMazing!!! Where do I even begin?! Been ordering Joes manapuas, pork hash and chow fun since they first started. Taste just like home in Hawaii and even comes in the pink box. 
We've tried pretty much everything on their menu and have never been disappointed. Don't believe me? Try it for yourself. Next for us to try...the Long Johns. Keep up the delicious food Joe!...your forever customer"}
{"text":"Glad you guys are open again! It was a shocker when we discovered you previously closed down. The locations closer to home too versus when you were in North Las Vegas. Thanks for making awesome manapuas and pork hash!"}
{"text":"This place is Not Da Pineapple Express, called Touch of Aloha. Being  there, I just thought hmm lets try it out. Here's what i ordered:

10.95 Kabli plate - The Kalbi came in a styrofoam box, all cut up into sections. With 2 scoops of rice. I've had a lot of Kalbi in my life, and I dont know how you can screw it up. This was a first... the Kalbi was toooooo sweet..wth?! Also, they were very thin pieces.

10.95 2 Choice - small portions....
Mochiko Chicken - the chicken was not crispy at all. Using Mochiko is supposed to give an added texture and more crunch.

Kalua pork - This was the only thing that was decent, unless the too off putting sweetness from the Kalbi made me want to crave the salt."}
