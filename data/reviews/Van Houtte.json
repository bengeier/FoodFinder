{"text":"Convenient cafe located right across the street from our hotel in Montreal.  I was DYING for some water and sustenance, as I just finished a 30+ mile bike ride around Montreal when I had only 1 bottle of water and some tiny crepes from Crepe Suzette to keep me going; so don't ask me how I finished that.  Let's just say I was spent spent spent.  Anyway, Van Houtte solved my problems!  Had the fruit cup (although there was some weird plastic wrap in some of the fruit?) and banana bread.  Also there is Wifi here, so if you are looking for a place to set up shop, they have comfy looking chairs and a counter against the window for you to people watch on the street."}
{"text":"Tout en longueur, ce chic café Van Houtte, à la station de métro Berri-UQAM,  prend la place de 2 anciens restaurants."}
{"text":"Pros: Comfortable seats Friendly staff  Lots of natural light They open early on Sunday mornings.   Cons It always smells like they burned something on the grill. When I leave this place, I smell like burned toast! Refrigerators are incredibly loud - word of advice, invest in new ones! Muffins are stale although they advertise them as being fresh"}
{"text":"Short changes Foreign Tourists. Beware  We bought a coffee here and the cashier shortchanged us $5.  We were tired and not familiar with the money at a glance."}
{"text":"Stopped into this Van Houtte and tried to get an iced coffee.    I did not realize that an \"iced coffee\" in Montreal is in their terms a mixed frozen beverage similar to the frappucino/frappe here in the states.    Either way, the \"iced coffee\" was pretty good, however, four dollars for a small was a bit high.  The coffee was also put in separately from the blended ice and syrup so it was hot at the bottom but frozen/cold on top when it was stirred.  Kind of odd.    The tables and milk/sugar bar were all clean and the desserts looked appetizing.  One door in is through the entrance to the adjacent office building and the other is all the way in the back along the side of Avenue du President Kennedy.    Around the corner from Station McGill."}
{"text":"Loved the setting, the ambiance was inviting and the staff was great. Excellent coffee and cappuccino. The croissant was very good. The bagel with cream cheese was delicious ..."}
{"text":"J'adore ! L'un de mes endroits préféré pour travailler après l'école. J'aime bien leur chocolat chaud. Le décor et le service sont bien :) l'endroit est bien situé si vous être en metro."}
{"text":"You know, I have to say that I was a bit disappointed with this perfectly located cafe in the heart of Old Montreal. I was strolling through this beautiful part of the city on a lunch break and stumbled upon this cafe. I walked in thinking that the inside would reflect the building- aged, a little worn, with a bunch of character- however, the inside was no different than a Starbucks you could find anywhere else. I realize that this is a chain of cafe shops in Montreal, but from this location I simply expected more. Furthermore, the service was very slow with only a single line opened when all I wanted was a coffee. Overall, my opinion is that this cafe was a huge missed opportunity to contribute to the most historical quarter of Montreal."}
{"text":"Very robust coffee !! Nice roaster pics on wall . Ordered a medium 16 oz coffee.  Enjoyed the atmosphere good music playing overhead. Nice selection of drinks and prepared sandwiches. Very clean."}
{"text":"Mediocre coffee with a somewhat dry muffin... And my laptop can't connect to the Internet. Not a winning day today!"}
{"text":"Was very thirsty and picked up a drink to go."}
{"text":"Un emplacement idéal pour ce nouveau Van Houtte!  Dans le métro Berri UQAM! Cela permet à tous les voyageurs, du matin au soir, d'aller prendre un café ou un chocolat accompagné d'une petite viennoiserie!  Attention la praticite l'emporte sur la qualité... Je dois avouer que leur chocolat chaud est assez bon car bien puissant en chocolat, par contre les pâtisseries ne sont pas terribles!  J'ai goûté leur scone aux petits fruits et il fallait chercher les petits fruits et il n'avait pas franchement l'air très frais!  J'y retournerai pour leur chocolat chaud...même si c'est assez onéreux!"}
{"text":"Walked by here for so long without knowing it exists.  Glad I tried it since it's one of the larger coffee shops, it fits in with the street it's on as it's quieter than most coffee shops.  Large windows and varied seats and a little isolated area is pretty cool.  I'm a Starbucks fan so the coffee is not my fave, but the price and selection are decent."}
{"text":"Fantastic sandwiches! I had a glorious Ham and Brie Cheese sandwich. It had a delicious pesto sauce. My daughter had a bagel with cream cheese and salmon which she devoured. The espresso was delicious and we would definitely return. People seem to walk by it because the entrance is not well advertised. This makes it less crowded and a pleasure to eat in."}
{"text":"Great French style cafe with good sandwiches, pastry, cakes and other desserts. There is of course a wide collection of coffees on the drinks menu. Located in the heart of Old-Montreal and the Old-Port, close to many points of interests."}
{"text":"As far as I know, you can only purchase Van Houtte k-cups in the US so I was excited to visit one of their cafes. Nice selection. A bit pricey. You can also buy k-cups. I got one of their pumpkin spice lattes. Service was a bit slow especially since we were the only customers. I'd prefer to be in and out faster ala a Starbucks experience as that's the vibe they are going for. I'd get a drink there again. They had a nice bakery selection but I didn't purchase anything. Very good coffee."}
{"text":"Un Van Houtte bien situé sur St-Catherine, proche de l'Uqam (d'ailleurs il y a toujours beaucoup d'étudiants)  L'endroit est grand, et pas souvent plein  Il y a souvent un \"line up\" pour commander Parfois, il y a des promos intéressantes (ex. café à 1$)"}
{"text":"My favourite place to stop for a drink or snack or when I don't feel like cooking in the morning they have well priced/delicious coffee, muffins, sandwiches and soup (no soup on Sundays, the lovely lady who makes it gets that day off). The staff is very caring and usually leaves you smiling!"}
{"text":"One of the best places to get lunch at Galleries du Parc. The staff is super helpful and so friendly you won't believe it. They have such a big menu and they serve breakfast all day. I haven't been disappointed so far in any of my choices. My preference is soups or wraps. You can customize the sandwiches however you want, for example you can add bacon or avocado. You have a choice of all condiments. Everything is freshly made the day of. Obviously it will taste a bit like a sandwich you might make at home, but if you don't have time to make yourself a lunch or if you need a quick bite in between classes/work this is a place to try out! Prices are moderate, some stuff is a bit more expensive than I thought it should be but it will taste better than something you might get at metro, the grocery store right across."}
{"text":"Canadian Starbucks. Coffee was good. They have some good breakfast sandwiches with the heat up on demand. In addition to having a decent sized area to sit inside there's also a huge lobby area that could hold more than 100 people just outside the door. A great place to do some work"}
{"text":"It's touristy. However it's perfectly located when visiting old Montreal. When it's cold outside, this is the perfect escape. The drinks may seem overpriced at first, but when you get them you'll see why. They come in gigantic mugs.   This place is a chain and are known for their chocolate. I tried the almond and chocolate croissants which were good but not amazing. The hot chocolate here is awesome. The matcha latte is very good but very milky.   Lots of seating. It's worth stopping in if your feet get tired."}
{"text":"That mocha latte would end wars. The premade BLT was actually delicious. No wifi and the cup was too big to sneak out in my coat."}
{"text":"I've had to stop in a few times for work. It's fine. The food is decent and the people are friendly. Nice and clean. Other than that it's a Van Houtte."}
{"text":"Bah c'est le Van Houtte hein. Si tu veux manger quelque chose de plus nutritif que la pizza d'à côté, tu peux t'en sortir, mais pas en bas de 5$. Les wraps (tout petits mais bien garnis) sont à 6.50$ minimum. Pour une baguette d'une dizaine de pouces, 8,75$.   Le service est ok. La première personne qui est venue me voir avant que j'aie décidé ce que je prenais avait l'air vexée que je ne sache pas quoi prendre après 30 secondes de réflexion. L'autre personne etait vraiment gentille et tout sourire. Elle m'a demandé si j'avais une carte étudiante. Une chance parce que le carton où c'est écrit qu'il y a des rabais étudiants n'est pas mise en évidence ;)   Bref si tu as des sous, que tu passes à toute vitesse et que tu as envie d'une pâtisserie ou un wrap ou un sandwich et que tu as oublié ton lunch, go, sinon tu peux aller encourager de commerces où la bouffe a une meilleure valeur!"}
{"text":"Nope!  While visiting Montreal we stopped in at this coffee shop before wandering the city. After stopping here, I think that in the future we will just keep walking.   Why was it so bad do you ask, well first and foremost, the large coffee was tiny (yes I'm a fat American, I have heard that before), it cost a fortune, it tasted like it was brewed in an ashtray, and when it came to the restaurant itself, it was gross and dirty.  We walked in at about 8:30 am and it looked like the place had been invaded by enemy troops. The staff was polite, but seemed more interested in talking amongst themselves. On top of that, the bathrooms were the worst we visited in Montreal.  Overall, not please with the coffee here and I would take McCafe coffee over this company any day. By the way, I greatly dislike McCafe coffee."}
{"text":"Located in La Cite underground mall complex, this little cafe is perfect when you need a delicious treat and coffee on the go. I had the salmon bagel with capers and onions, which was made fresh in front of my eyes and a tall cafe latte which really kicked my butt into gear. Both, the sandwich and the coffee were superb! The ladies who work here are amazingly friendly yet quick and on point and will make sure you leave with a smile. Thank you, Van Houtte!!"}
{"text":"They charged me 0.50$ extra for putting about 1 oz of soy milk in my filtered coffee!??!!?!? If it was a latte or something that required a lot then no problem I will never come back here and in the area there are so many better places. I.e. Second Cup, Melk , Leaves just to mention a few  It's not the monetary value it the balls these people have. That's why the place is empty Last time I come here You suck van houtte  I forgot to add that the coffee suck and the place is falling apart, the benches a ripping apart. It looks like a rundown place trying to sell high quality coffee"}
{"text":"This was my first stop in Montreal. The hot chocolate and cappuccino were tasty and very pretty. The chocolate croissant was good but nothing too special for my taste buds. This location is very close to Bota Bota Spa, which is why I visited the shop. The staff were incredibly friendly and the location offered a nice street view of the city. Overall, I recommend stopping in for a nice hot coco to warm you up!"}
{"text":"Decent little coffee and sandwich shop we stopped in on a whim.  Located only a block or so off the riverfront on a quaint cobblestone lined street.  Great spot to grab a table by the window to watch the crowds walk by as you enjoy lunch.  I had a cup of the chicken noodle soup, which was flavorful and good.  It could have been hotter and had a little more chicken, but it was still good.  My wife and daughter each got toasted sandwiches of which I had a bite and thought they were good.  Overall a cool little place and not bad for lunch."}
{"text":"The food at these shops is terrible. It is like eating airplane food. Salty, bland, thoughtless. Do yourself a favor, spend your money somewhere that cares a little about quality."}
{"text":"BITTER! ACID! Their coffee is quite terrible. To top it off -- no wifi. Why did I pay to sit down with the most bitter, acidic coffee I've ever had and not even be able to check email while at it?  At least the place is clean, should you just need a place to rest."}
{"text":"If you've been to any Van Houtte, this is like any other. Solid location this one, pretty clean and good service. 4 stars."}
{"text":"Pour moi, un Van Houtte, c'est un peu comme un Starbucks, un Second Cup, un Java U, et compagnie. Il est difficile de les évaluer séparément parce qu'on dirait qu'ils se ressemblent tous tellement et parfois c'est bien alors qu'à d'autres moments un peu moins. Quand je cherche un bon latte avec des pâtisseries qui font saliver juste à les regarder, je trouve que Van Houtte n'est pas fort, fort. Mais quand je veux un bon café filtre, un endroit tranquille pour lire, travailler, jaser avec une amie pendant une pause, et que je ne connais pas les cafés du coin, c'est un très bon endroit. L'adresse de celui-ci est sur Stanley, mais la porte est plutôt sur Maisonneuve. Le décor est contemporains et bien confortable avec un style de chaise ou de table pour chacun et chacune (tables ordinaires, divans confos et tables \"cocktail\" avec chaises en hauteur). Le menu inclut de bonnes options pour le lunch (salades, sandwichs, quiches) et ils offrent des boissons de toutes sortes."}
{"text":"Cute little coffee shop in old Montreal. I dropped in here to escape the rain during my visit. Excited about being in Canada, I obviously had to order a maple latte. It may be too sweet for some people, but it was perfect for me! I love my coffee very sweet, and light on the actual coffee flavor. The food isn't quite as good as the coffee, but still good. I had a nice chocolate croissant, but it could've been a bit fresher."}
{"text":"Nice comfortable cafe with many breakfast sandwich choices and decent coffee right in the heart of the old town. Friendly staff with comfortable seating."}
