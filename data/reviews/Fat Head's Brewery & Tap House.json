{"text":"I love their beer. I love it. I should have come sooner to support brewery. I spend money every other place I go on headhunter IPA( aka the best IPA in country). I wasn't expecting much as far as food. They did however serve me the best chicken wings I have ever had period. I enjoyed the cuban but I am docking the star from review bc I wish bartender told me how amazing they were.  I had to hear from the guy sitting next to me on the bar. He said I should have got wings for app and entree. They should pull the chicken off the wings and make a chicken melt or salad sandwich. I'm telling you they are the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!( all the way to end exclamation marks)"}
{"text":"We stopped on our way into town.  Loved the beer and the wings were great.  We may of gotten a slightly rude barmaid but that didn't spoil the stop."}
{"text":"Great variety of beer, great food, pulled pork was delicious, wings were enormous. Fast and friendly service. Will definately be returning."}
{"text":"The food here is spectacular. The \"Giant Bavarian Pretzel\" was so good! The pizza is very cheesy. Even if you don't like the cheese you will still like the pizza. It makes you come back for more. The prices were a little high, but the food was worth it.   While you are there, you can buy something called a growler to fill up on any type of Fatheads beer. There are so many different types of beer to choose from so if you like a type of beer FatHeads should have it.   There are also tours around the brewery on Saturdays. There are 3 TVs to watch sports. At times the restaurant is noisy when brewing. The noise will not bother you because the food is so fantastic. On your way out you can stop at the gift shop and get any souvenirs you would like.   Overall this is a great restaurant. Even though it is slightly more expensive it is a must to go there."}
{"text":"Great beer. Limited food. Everything needs to be ordered at the bar. Prefer to go to the regular location in north Olmsted."}
{"text":"Fecking awesome joint.  The bartender was quick as a cat and friendly.  The beer was wicked tasty.  I wish I had more time to take in all of the ones I wanted to try but I was driving so just a couple for me.  I had the pulled pork samich with the potato salad- damn good vitals right there don't cha know.  Yeah buddy- ng my ass through Cleveland I'm swinging by for another Head Hunter or two."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and beer. Not easy to find as it looks like a warehouse. Fun place to go after work."}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent beer!  Portions are huge so you will have left overs for lunch the next day.  Wings, burgers, chili, sandwiches, everything is great!"}
{"text":"Would have been a perfect 5 if I could just rate the beer!  Have so many I love.  The food was so/so, fine, but nothing to write home about.  I had the lobster bisque and salad and the hubby had a chicken sandwich.  Too much bun on that sandwich, btw.  But again, mighty fine beers compensate."}
{"text":"To compare and contrast Fatheads tap house brewery in Middleburg Hts with their N Olmsted restaurant location would be like talking about the stark difference between day and night. The extent to which they could be compared is limited to the beer offerings. Even that can differ however as the tap house tends not to run out of beers  since they are brewed there. They often have beers on tap that are out at the NOLM restaurant.   The tap house is smaller and more quaint. Service is phenomenal. Even when busy you never wait long for a beer. Not the same as the larger restaurant locations-at least NOLM. Can't speak about PITT. You really get service with a smile at the tap house. Employees always seem happy as well. If you want to go somewhere where the staff isn't cranky, this is the place. Not to mention the ambiance of being in the warehouse, with all of the vats in plain view, and the warehouse staff working hard. It is quite the scene. It doesn't feel like northeast Ohio. One would swear they are on vacation some place cool like Key West.   A trip to the tap house is like a local getaway. Leave your problems behind. Did I mention how knowledgeable the employees are and how fresh the beer tastes? Also, the food is better, and on average, cheaper than at the NOLM restaurant. They always have cheap but yummy food specials at the tap house. My, my my.   Why would anyone go the the N Olm restaurant if you could go here? The only reason would be the limited hours that the tap house is open. The restaurant in NOLM has more expansive hours than theMiddleburg Hts location. But, the tap house is like football on Sunday. If you wait long enough for it you appreciate it more.   Ok, so there is one small downfall to the tap house. You could park a truck in the bathrooms they are so big yet there is only 1 urinal and 1 toilet in the men's room and just 2 toilets in the ladies room. That will undoubtedly change when the new tap house is open later this year or next year.   Another small downside is Uber drivers get scared to pick you up here because all they see is a warehouse and they think they might be getting lured someplace off the beaten path.  No there's actually a hidden bar (gem) here folks!  If you haven't been to the tap house but you've been to N Olmsted's Fatheads restaurant you owe it to yourself to visit this place. You will NOT be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Our favorite place to come when we are in the area. We get so much good food for the money! The service is always good and the variety of beers excellent plus the pizza, ahhhh."}
{"text":"A great place to drink craft beer and hang out ... The staff is really cool too..Oh ya the pizza is awesome ..You can't beat the $2 soft tacos neither. The only thing is I wish they would stay open later!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place. Really flavorful beer...bold, smooth recipes. Great shrimp tacos and smoked wings."}
{"text":"Not impressed. We walked in, 3 workers were standing nearby. No one greeted us and were basically ignored. We sat ourselves and waited over 10 minutes until we were able to flag someone down. We were told that we had to order at the bar. The ambience is warehouse but not very exciting. No signage out front makes it very hard to find. Basically if you want the food of fat heads, go to the original fat heads. This is more for the behind the scenes brewery look."}
{"text":"A really cool place to have some great fatheads beers and hangout.  I made it here the first time on Saturday and really enjoyed it.  I don't know if it is always this way, but I really liked the music they were playing: social d, pixies, cracker, (alot of late 80s and 90s alternative.). It's a bit hard to find because it's part of an industrial park, but the address is marked and there is a small campaign type sign put front."}
{"text":"I can't believe I waited so long to come here.   Now it took me a second to find the place and I had to call and ask for help, because I thought I was lost, it's definitely a warehouse but the spectrum trucks threw me off...But after a confusing 5 minutes all was well. I missed taking the last tour of the factory, but the food was sooooo good!  Once inside I ordered the bumble berry salad which was delish and at the suggestion of our waitress I also ordered the smoked wings with buffalo and garlic parmesan sauce. To drink I had the Bumble berry honey blueberry ale.....Overall I was very impressed with the decor and the service received. Prices were reasonable, the beer cost $5, the wings $6, and the salad was pretty big and under 10 bucks. I love that the kitchen is an open layout and the seating was cozy.   I'll definitely be back in a few days to sample some other menu items!"}
{"text":"The head Hunter IPA was quite good and refreshing. However, the Triple Bypass burger was one of the most disappointing beers I've had, partly because of the name. For a triple bypass, I expect more than a standard patty, eggs, and bacon. The burger was flat out bland, to be honest - there was very little flavor. It was also smaller than my friend's pulled pork sandwich b  The fries were okay but cooled down quite quickly.   I give 3 stars instead of 2 because my friends enjoyed their beer, black bean burger, and pulled pork."}
{"text":"I have been to the Fat Heads restaurant quite a few times when I travel to cleveland but was excited to finally try the new tap room.  We went on a Saturday afternoon and it was dead which I was happy with. It's quite hidden, but once inside its very spacious. Lots of picnic tables, a giant bar decked out with hop decorations and spears (that the headhunter uses of course), and some tables scattered around.  Behind you or in front of you depending where you sit are all the tanks and the brewery itself, so it is fun to see it all happening right there. We each got a beer, already had eaten so didnt order food but the beer was so fresh and delicious.  Next door is the gift shop with a good amount of stuff, but I just left with a couple cases of head hunter which was brewed within the week.   All in all great spot, and I'm more likely to go there instead of the restuarant because of the freshness of the beer and the ambiance."}
{"text":"They recently added tap lines and now have 12-13 house brews, so extra star added. It is starting to get more crowded... That happens when you have the best beer in town."}
{"text":"Learned they have live bands that start @6:30, thats right up my alley, I like to party early and crash early.  Always offer a great selection of quality beer.  Service is always quick and friendly. Food items are worth checking out.  This place is well worth your time and money."}
{"text":"Love this place! Found out last year we would be coming to Cleveland for a wedding and we're most excited about coming to Fat Heads again. Food is amazing!!! Beer is also amazing!!"}
{"text":"I go to Fat Head's many times with my trips to Ohio.  Great food and great craft beer.  You got to hit this place when you are in town."}
{"text":"So, I love a place with novelty, and how much more novel could you get to have a really great meal INSIDE a brewery, and I'm not talking a place that has a few vats showing through a window, I'm talking having a meal in an enclosed, beer-garden type space inside a very large brewery INSIDE of a warehouse.   I think it's pretty cool:)  Unlike the other location for Fat Heads on Lorain, you'll not be able to find this one so easily. My wife and I passed it like 3 times before calling and finding out that this place is more or less HIDDEN inside of the main  Fat Heads brewing plant, which is at the BACK of an industrial complex off of Sheldon. If you look from the street, you see a small, round sign that shows the smiling, chubby countenance of the Fat Heads mascot beckoning you back to the rear of the complex...  And therein...is treasure:)  As I said, it's like going to a beer garden inside a brewery, and my, what a garden. They have daily/weekly specials and a rather small menu, but the food was really great, as was the service. The pulled pork we all had was piled high, and the brews, some standard and some SPECIAL brews like their \"Spooky Tooth\" pumpkin ale, are all just amazing. BTW, that particular beer is the closest you're going to get in drinking, well, a pumpkin pie. It was great. Another amazing item is their giant soft pretzel...it's as big a pizza...yes you heard it right. This place is great and it just felt really cool. One note as well; this place is scrupulously clean, I mean, I've seen clean places, but this place must get scrubbed down daily; it was a pleasant experience.   The prices are about standard for Fat Heads and I have to say, I like it for the fact that it's not as \"busy\" as their other location, it's for a person who just wants to enjoy a decent meal and relax.   On top of all that, Mondays they run tours where you can get samples and see the brewing process in action. Also, they have, across the hall, a very fine gift shop full of Fat Heads merchandise and a cooler full of some of their special ales; TASTY:)  So, if you want to search out a treasure in Middleburg Heights that's worth looking for, search out  Fat Heads Tap House and get a brew for you!  (Just an addendum; they're closed Mondays and Tuesdays, I'm assuming because of brewery business, and their hours during the week are limited, but it makes it all that much more great to stop by when you can in the evening:)"}
{"text":"I'm not really a Fat Head's fan.  I've been several times to the location on Lorain and meh...just never really excited about the food or the beer.    The beau and I stopped here at the Tap House on our way to see a show at Tri-C.  It is tucked away in a small industrial plaza.  When you walk in you know you're in a warehouse and they have a very psychedelic looking gift-shop.  We walked right up to the bar, placed our order and picked a table to sit at.  The beau ordered a crock of soup to go with his beer. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed my beer.  The beau liked his soup and his beer too!  I perused a few other menu items and thought to myself, \"These look better than the options at the Lorain location!\".    The Tap house offers beer tours for a $5 fee.  I liked the \"bier garten\" set-up with picnic tables and hanging lights.    I'd definately go back and probably take some friends too the next time!"}
{"text":"Bottom Line: I've been dreaming about this place and can't wait to go back!!  It is in a residential area. Our shuttle driver drove by 3 times. I looked on Yelp and saw what the building looked like and that's how we found it.   When we first walked in we weren't so sure if we made a mistake. It was quiet. There are picnic tables to sit and some high tops and a small bar area as well. There was a TV on over the bar.  Since they do brew the beer there you are surrounded by the tall fermentation tanks.   We sat down and wound up ordering flights. Their Head Hunter IPA, which you can find in a lot of the local bars and restaurnats is very good.  If I weren't at a brewery and I didn't try several other beers - i would've stuck with that and been very happy.  But...... I did sample and The Zuess Juice was my favorite. I liked several but stuck with the Zuess Juice when my food came.   I ordered the Dry Rub Wings and I Swear! To! You! These! Are! The! Best! Wings! Ever!  Super sized and super juicy. Crispy skin. The blue cheese dressing was also delicious.  Smoke House Wings: \"Our almost famous smoked chicken wings house smoked and tossed in our Dry Rub, Smoky BBQ Sauce, Original Buffalo Sauce, Garlic Parmesan, or Bumble Berry BBQ. Carrots and celery on the side with your choice of ranch or blue cheese $9.99 Extra dressing .50¢\"  Someone else ordered the Cuban. Not your usual Cuban, better. Cuban Sammy: \"Smoked pulled pork, Bavarian Ham, Swiss Cheese, stadium mustard and pickles on a brioche bun\"  $10.99.  The pork was a pulled pork, but then it also had the ham, cheese and pickles. The other difference was that it was on a bun. Very juicy sandwich.  Our friend made the mistake of using the rest room - my other friend and I attacked the sandwich. The other guy had the Brat - which was also good but I wouldn't pass up the wings or Cuban!  We also ordered the Beignets: \"Three light airy pastries filled with raspberry crème and custard dusted generously in powdered sugar\"  $3.99.  One bite in and we were ordering another round for the table. Light and airy and delicious.   Bottom Line: Great Beer - Great Food - And very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"What brought us to Middleburg Heights?? Well, buying Fatheads beer from a store 5 days ago which turned out to be old and skunky. I've got to say, this place is an A+ for customer service.    We ended up commenting on Facebook that the beer wasn't so good. Immediately, the company told us to bring in whats left of the 6 pack and would swap out for a fresh new pack of beer - Thats great!! But it didn't end there.    We drove the 40 minutes to the warehouse/brewery. I knew that this place didn't have a full menu and isn't a \"restaurant\" but did have some bar food. We were planning on having dinner while we were here. Walking in, immediately I though it was awesome to have an open floor concept, warehouse feel where you can see the every barrel, and all the steel fermenting tanks (I think... you know, cool beer making stuff).  What a great way to have the brewery experience by tasting great beer and have the workers behind you tending to the beer.   The pizza was delicious. The brownie sunday, was absolutely amazing. Hit the spot. And goes well with beer!! Ok, maybe not...  But dinner was great. Meanwhile, the group of people who appeared to be workers, drinking in the corner of the seating area, pull out corn hole (yard game) and start playing that right in front of the tanks. This place seems like an awesome place to work and have fun!  Anyway, back to the customer service... Our bill came with a generous discount for having purchased old beer, along with our fresh new 6 pack of beer. Staff was very apologetic about the old beer.   This place has brew tours on Saturdays for $5, which includes a souvenir glass and money spent goes to charity. We will definitely be back with friends. Great beer, fantastic customer service, delicious food, and a cool warehouse atmosphere."}
{"text":"As a Fat Head's lover...I cannot excuse how long it took me to go here.    When I pulled in the driveway, there was very little indication of the place. Then I recalled it was a tap room. Duh!   This place rocks out loud. You get a limited menu (fine!), and a smaller beer list.   The seating area is decent, and the atmosphere is very casual. Service has been outstanding.   There is a small gift/swag shop on your way in. The bar is separated from the tanks by a low wall. So you really are sitting in the brewery. Polished concrete floors, high top bar tables and picnic tables in addition to bar seating.  I love this place. What you get here is more beer lovers, and less \"restaurant only\" folks. One of the items that made the small menu is the smoke house wings. Yes!  The pizza is good, but nothing like the restaurant.   I've never had to wait for a table, yet it has always appeared full. Weird. But love that.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Such a cool place to go. Definately a great place to bring guests from out of town for a low key dinner and beer, or a super casual date.   They have a live band area, daily specials, and roughly 15 different Fat Head brewed beers that change frequently...everything from drinkabke, lighter brews to 9% ABV \"knock you on your ass\" beers. Bumbleberry is a crowd pleaser and it come with fresh blueberries which are an adorable bonus. Seasonal  Spooky Tooth is a \"punchy\" imperial ale with a hint of pumpkin pie. How could you go wrong with a beer named Spooky Tooth?!  Food is phenomenal, and reasonably priced (around 10 bucks for an item) Something for everybody from healthier, contemporary items to pizzas and gormet burgers. All home made in house.   The only con is that it can get pretty busy, and the small area fills up fast, so get there early for dinner if you have a bigger party or don't want to wait."}
{"text":"Fun place to visit.  Its a little off the beaten path - at the back of an industrial park area, but just look for all the parked cars outside! Great brewery with a great selection of brews on tap.  Plus a pretty decent food menu."}
{"text":"I had my first taste of headhunter 2 weeks ago it was so good a friend and I made a special trip to Cleveland to pick up my own! Nice brewery, tucked into a business park. Not hard to find really. Beer was great! I had a few flights and ordered some pretty good grub. Got a kick out of seeing pizzas being tossed in the kitchen. My only gripe wss that it was loud, but forgivable as it is a huge space and they put out a great product! Would love distribution close to home, untill then it's a great excuse for a road trip!"}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorites on the planet. My 2 favorite beers are the Goggle Fogger and the classic Bumble Berry! Both of great with their nachos. I cannot wait until the new HUGE location with full restaurant opens in Middleburg Heights. I am a native who moved to charlotte NC and this is a must stop every time I'm in ohi"}
{"text":"I didn't actually eat here. I'm just giving 5 Stars to the genius who started selling Head Hunter IPA in 6-Packs instead of 4 Packs."}
{"text":"Love Fatheads tap house! Great beers. This place is very cool with great atmosphere. It's very colorful and open place with Good food and great beers. One word. Awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Found this place only because a coworker told me about it, otherwise I would have thought that it was another warehouse. Food is decently priced and tasty, portions could be bigger but I'm not enough to detract from it. The real star of the show is the craft beer, the stuff is delicious and the happy hour prices only helps it seem more attractive to the consumer. Next time I'm in town I'll try and bring some others so I can show them like I was introduced."}
{"text":"As a lover of all things Ohio craft beer, for me it doesn't get much better than Fat Head's Brewery & Tap House. Just a few things that might help you out if you're thinking about paying them a visit:  1. It's a production brewery, not a brew pub - This means that they're focus here is on making beer and not running a restaurant. The menu is small, mostly bar bites, pizza and sandwiches. Don't come here expecting a full restaurant experience. You can always go to the Fat Head's Brewery & Saloon in North Olmsted if that's what you're looking for.  2. They serve the beer they're making - If you don't want to drink Fat Head's beer don't come here. Limited draught selection? Really? When I was there they had eight beers pouring. Want 50 taps? Go to World of Beer.  3. You have to order at the bar - It says it on the menu but it'll save you some confusion if you know it ahead of time. Every table has a menu. Just figure out what you want then go up to the bartender and put in your order. They'll give you a number and bring it out to you when it's done.  4. They offer tours & have limited hours - Self explanatory  This review is of our first visit to the tap house. We stopped in around 1pm on a Saturday. When you walk in the gift shop is to the right and the tap room is through a door to the left. Seat yourself. A pretty good crowd was scattered about the space that probably seats about 60 at a mixture of high-tops, picnic tables and bar stools. I really liked the tabletops decorated with bottle caps. Nice touch.  Since it's inside of the production brewery it's very open and airy. It's also a working brewery. You can see the gleaming stainless steel of the brewery to the rear, the bottling line to the right, and the pallets of bottles and boxes stacked nearly to the ceiling. The walls are painted with colorful murals and clouds and they've proudly displayed their beer competition medals for all to see.  The beer, my god the beer. If you want to taste Fat Head's beer the way the brewers intended this is where you need to be. Drinking fresh craft beer right in the same place that it's made just makes me smile. It doesn't get any fresher than this and Fat Head's makes some of the best craft beer in the state. If you're not too familiar with their beers, hell, even if you are, I suggest you get a sampler. On this visit I got all eight of their beers. Samples are about 2.5oz each and vary in price from $1.25 to $2.25.   The service was pretty good, on par with a typical bar and nothing that had me thinking to myself \"wow, such great service.\" I've got to give them credit, though. They have a closet for a kitchen and among the three of them they managed to keep everything humming along at a decent clip. It would have been nice to be served waters as soon as we were seated. This is a misstep not specific to Fat Head's, just something I noticed.  As others have already stated, their menu is small, but you can't go wrong with any of the selections. It's fatty, full of empty carbs and completely delicious with their beer. Here's what we had during our visit:  Giant Bavarian Pretzel - Amazing. This had to be one of the best soft pretzels I've ever eaten and I've eaten a lot of 'em. Flown in from Germany, they're everything a soft pretzel wants to be. Big, crispy, buttery, soft, yeasty, salty and served with cheese sauce, honey mustard and Headhunter IPA stone-ground mustard for dipping. I could eat 10 of these things.  Pulled Pork Sandwich - Tender, juicy smoked and pulled pork slathered in sweet BBQ sauce and served on a soft bun. You get a choice of potato salad or vinegar slaw as a side. The slaw, while not my favorite (I'm a mayo-based slaw guy) was good on the sandwich and the pork was awesome.  I know what you're thinking. All this love and no 5-stars? Here's what stopped it from making my elite club:  Out of too many things - We wanted the Crock of the Day (their daily soup selection) and were told that it wasn't ready with no ETA. And it was chicken paprikash! Bummer. They were also out of Head Trip, Fat Head's Belgian-inspired tripel. One of my personal favorites. They replaced it with one of my least favorites, Gogglefogger. Bummer. We also had a slight moment of confusion when it came to how we were to pay the check. We weren't sure if we had to settle up at the bar or if they brought it out to the table (the latter, in case you're wondering).  With the few minor exceptions listed above, this has to be one of my new favorite places. Fat Head's has not only done Ohio craft beer right they've managed to up the ante in the game of brewery tap rooms as well. I can't wait to get my butt back in one of their seats again."}
{"text":"GO HERE! Amazing service, amazing food and ... dare I said, amazing beer? Yes. Amazing everything! Escape the usual business of every brewery/restaurant and come on down to Fat Heads brewery and tap house! Kick back on a picnic table and take in the views! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Good food, good beers, and a good brewery atmosphere, what else can you ask for?  I came in on a Saturday night at 7pm with a group of 7 people and we were able to find a table no problem. It got busier as the night went on. There are picnic tables and some high tops, plus a bar area.  Food menu is very reasonably priced. Everyone enjoyed their meals. I got one of the daily specials, the October-Feast. The portion sizes were large. Each entree was around $9-$11. The beers however are not cheap. $6-$7 for a pint. I just had one beer, the black IPA and it was good. Most of the beers are high ABV so actually just one was enough for me with dinner.  The location is in the back of a big warehouse building, and quite hard to find on your first trip. We drove past and had to turn around twice before we ended up in the right place. Just follow the GPS by address, and it will lead you to the right place.  There is no obvious sign at the front of the warehouse, we just had to guess it was back there because of the numerous parked cars we saw.  This is a great place to come and hang out with a group for a few drinks and dinner. The service was also good.  Another thing to note is that the menu at this Fat Heads location is not the same as the North Olmsted one. N. O. store has a much bigger menu. But I found there to be plenty of tasty sounding things on the menu here."}
{"text":"This place has easy the best selection of tasty IPAs in the  state. Sure, you can find great Hoppy brews at several breweries in Ohio. What makes Fat Head stand out is they produce several !  Also, when you come here they offer many upper scale guest brews as well.  This combo for the \"Hop Head \" sets them apart. Food at this place is impressive as well. So now you have the  \" Trifecta\" . Amazing in house IPAs, Exceptional guest IPAs & tasty food. WAIT !  Ohio ? . . . . Yup.  Sure, in San Diego.    But Olmsted Ohio ? .  If your in Cleveland, Akron or within a 50 mile radius, do yourself a favor. Treat your palate to Fat Head Saloon."}
{"text":"Yummy!! Hubby and I tried with our local friends and it was excellent! There was a wait for a table in the restaurant but we got 4 seats at the bar with no problem. The bartender took our orders fast but food was a bit slow but well worth the wait! We shared a cheesesteak which was huge and delicious! The chips that came with it were also very good! Would definitely go back next time we're in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Would really like to give it 3.5 stars. Came here for hop juju day. Pretty difficult to find this place- we drove right past it on the first go. It's in the wayy back of an industrial area with no signage to locate it on the main road. We picked up our JuJus in the attached gift shop and went to the main brew area to grab something on tap. The tap house is an open, large, warehouse-y feel area with lots of eclectic artwork and decorations. Plenty of room to mill around and enjoy your beer. We got a seat by the bar and ordered 2 beers, wings and a sausage dish.  Our bartender was not very good at all. She asked what we wanted with no expression on her face and didn't give any affirmation after getting our order- just took our credit card and walked away. Zero ounce of friendliness and you could tell she clearly did not want to be there. There were 2 separate groups that came by to order a drink from her and we bonded over the fact that we all thought she had an attitude (that's pretty bad). Didn't catch her name but she had blonde hair with highlights. I know it must have been a busy day but really, what a buzzkill. As for our orders, our beers and wings were great. The wings were HUGE and tasty.  Would come here again for the beers but run to the other side of the bar if I saw that bartender again."}
{"text":"The food was alright. Not really a place to have a nice sit-down dinner but if you just want to hang out and chill, the picnic tables and barrel tables will give you what you need. The Thor Platter Band was amazing.  I enjoyed the B.B. King tribute.  My husband tried \"The Gringo\" and end up sending it back. It came recommended but apparently it is an acquired taste. I do not eat pork so i have no opinion. And on that note, if you aren't a pork eater beware - this menu is not for you.  The majority of the dishes have pork of some form on it. Again, chill atmosphere but I personally  will stick to the salad sans pork  when I visit again."}
{"text":"I love this place! Nothing better than hanging out in a massive production facility, drinking beers, eating good grub and shooting the shit. I like the way Randall painted the place so you kind of feel like you are outdoors, they did a good job of separating the tasting room from production facility even though you are sitting right next to all the action.   The staff here is always nice and pleasant. The brats made by Grumpy are a must try. The Headhunter brat is my favorite one.  It's a little hard to find but I like it that way. I love the mothership in North O but I think the place gets a little to busy on most days and this place has a more personal feel to it."}
{"text":"My first time here to meet a couple friends. Food & beer was good and server was great. Cons:  -difficult to locate without  gps.  -I did not like the atmosphere at all. Lights were on like it was last call and our table was too tall for our seats. I am 5'8\" and I looked like I was sitting at a table in a fun house. I realize there were regular sized tables to sit but there were none open when we arrived.  -Also, there was a terrible smell. Don't know if it was from the beer making but it smelled like sewer.  So, not a great first impression, although we just thought it would be like the location in North Olmsted."}
{"text":"I really didn't expect much when I came from Columbus to go on a brewery tour of Cleveland. Our first stop was fat head brewery! I got the most amazing burger I've ever had and it was cooked to perfection! Lots of great swag to choose from also!"}
{"text":"This is the tasting room right in the middle of the production facility. They have a small sampling of appetizers and tasters of beers and of course full pints. The hours seems to be limited, but open when I wanted a taste. Super good. There was a sign on the wall about brewery tours on Saturday."}
{"text":"The best beer I've ever had.  Consecutively. Everything they make is top notch. With amazing food to boot."}
{"text":"What a great place to visit! Located off the beaten path, and harder to find (we droves past it twice!), it was certainly worth it! There is a decent sized seating area and bar. It is seat yourself, and there is a mix of picnic tables and high top tables to choose from.  They had a wide variety of their beers on tap, ranging from the flagships to the more seasonal selections. I had the goggle fogger, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes a hefe. For those who are younger, or not interested in beer, they have soda.  For lunch, they have selection of sandwiches and pizzas to choose from. I got the pulled pork sandwich with the kettle chips. It was pretty good! The sandwich itself was HUGE, and they certainly didn't skimp on the pulled pork. It wasn't overly sauced. I added melted cheddar cheese to mine, and added a slightly saltier note to the sweeter bbq sauce.  We got the brownie blintz for dessert, and it was tasty! Two scoops of vanilla ice cream on top of a brownie, with whipped cream and chocolate drizzled on top. The brownie came out of the oven, so the combination of hot and cold made it even better!  We weren't rushed, and were allowed to take our time and enjoy. Our server was friendly and helpful! We will definitely be stopping back!"}
{"text":"What a find!!  First of all, I accidentally found this place by looking on Yelp!!  What a cool place!!   It's in an industrial place and you would never even know it was there.   Super nice staff, great beer and good food.   The give tours of the plant on Saturdays at 1, 2 and 3pm - $5  We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I really thought this place was great compared to the other fatheads in Cleveland and the one in Pitt.  Those places are so commercial and try so hard to appeal to everyone.  They feel like Disneyland to me, I expect goofy to come out of the bathroom.  This place was nice though, I enjoyed the atmosphere, the way simpler menu.  In Pitt the have this huge menu and thing that a pierogi belongs on everything.  I think this place is far above the others.. Go here and not to the other clown shows."}
{"text":"I always enjoy this place for beer and some bar food. This is the place we take visitors to Cleveland since it's not as busy as the other Fat Heads. The beer is great, food menu is smallish, but just right, and the atmosphere is unique (yes, it's their brewing facility with pub and picnic tables)."}
{"text":"Been here many times, and will keep coming back!   Beer is top notch and food is great.   Can't wait for the grand opening at the new, Yuge location!"}
{"text":"Traveling to a family wedding we stayed at a local hotel, and decided to try Fat Head's Brewery for a quick dinner and libation. The grilled veggie sandwich was delicious with the aioli sauce , but the best part was the Bumble Berry Draft with blueberries floating on the top. After a long drive, it hit the spot! My husband had the Cuban Sammy, but don't order this monster unless you are very hungry! I took a taste, and was hit with just the right amount of zip and sweetness. For big eaters, the Cuban Sammy would be perfect. Fat Head beers are diverse enough for the person who likes a sweeter beer, to a pale ale, or those that prefer dark  beer."}
{"text":"Place is awesome.  Guys who work in the brewery are super cool.  Janet is super cool as well and knows her shit when it comes to beer.  Sundays are my fav day to come here.  Super low-key.  $1.00 off beers, pretzels and wings.  Sign me up!"}
{"text":"The food here isn't really anything to write home about - the tacos aren't done especially well, the wings are good but hard to handle due to being a larger cut of the chicken than what you'd typically think of for wings, but the pretzel and dip appetizer is certainly worth ordering when you're here. The beer selection, however, is enough that any beer-drinkers should be able to find something to suit their palates, and the staff is pretty friendly and quick to turn around your order.  3.5 stars would probably be more appropriate, but the quality of the food doesn't merit rounding up to 4.  Also, keep an eye out for this place when driving there - it looks like just a generic office park building from the road, and you have to drive to the back of the lot to even see any indication that the restaurant is there."}
{"text":"The best thing I can say about his place is .... smoked wings. I know I should have said the beer. And yes I do love their beers. But the smoked wings are so good. I want to get some while drinking an aged bourbon ale. Then I want to get some to go. I could come here and just drink samples all day"}
{"text":"How fun is this place.? You have to really look for it to find it it is literally on the side of a warehouse there is like no real signs and if you don't know it's there you won't find it. It took us a while to be able to find this place. I'm ever so glad I did.  We ordered several items of food including a spinach salad that was a very large, a brought worst of sorts that was pretty decent although the slaw was a little bit odd, and true sampled several beers all of which were great. The bar is literally right there with the tanks they just sort of carved a little area out of the brewery to make their bar. This is the kind of place that you like, it just has a few locals in it it was not crowded and everybody was friendly. The service was excellent. I will definitely come back here again if I am in Cleveland."}
{"text":"One of the better brew houses I have been to and I travel throughout North America! The food is awesome and the portions fill the hungriest southern appetite. The brew is cold and selection diverse. Make this a stop when in Cleveland!!!"}
{"text":"I have always been fascinated by the brewing process and all the different kinds of beer there are in the world. If I liked beer, I would be an alcoholic. Attempting to try every kind I can get my hands on. Alas, I was born with a tongue that has an aversion to all alcohol. I lead a tough life. Fortunately, there is a place where I can get my \"How it's made\" fix and enjoy the other amenities the business has to offer. I'm talking about my first great love....FOOD!  Off the beaten path, this little tap house has everything we could ask for. Great beer brewed right on site for my Goggle-Fogger loving boyfriend, and a small yet delicious menu for me, the food lover. When I say a small menu, I mean small. Pizza, a couple sandwich choices, and some bar munchies. But the choices you do have are quite good.  Trevor had the Muffuletta sammich and could not put it down. Mostly because it was huge but also because it was so delicious. With three kinds of meat, two types of cheese, and various sauces...whats not to love?!   I had \"The Gringo\" pizza. Taco sauce seasoned pulled pork, cheese, veggies, and sour cream. The perfect mesh of Italian/Mexican goodness. The crust was amazing. Crispy on the outside and fluffy bread on the inside. SO good. It also re-heated well the next day which is always a plus for me. The more meals I can get out of something, the better.  We also attended a fundraiser here for the Cleveland Futbol Club a couple weeks that was very well put together. Some of that of course had to do with the Club itself, but I was impressed by the service we received by the brewery itself. They has a great food spread. Mac and cheese, pulled pork sandwiches, chicken, pretzel bites, and pizza garlic bread. SO GOOD for food made in bulk. We had 5 tickets for beer samples and they provided numerous beers to choose from. They even gave us free hats. I was very impressed."}
{"text":"Love the tap house!  It was opened when they expanded their brewing capacity and I'm so glad they did!  It really is supposed to be just a tap house but they have expanded the food options so now it's really a mini-Fat Heads restaurant in a way.  LOVE the smoked wings! Always a favorite of mine!  Their bleu cheese dressing that I get with the smoked wings is some of the best I've ever had.  They always have a different menu at the tap house with a  few standards so you can always find something different.  The smoked wings are always on the menu as well as fresh, soft pretzels, which are also very good.  They usually have brat sandwiches which go really well with the beer.  Their beer selection is always very good and while the don't have every beer Fat Heads brews at all times (neither does the restaurant) it has the great standards that everyone loves all the time - Head Hunter IPA, Bumbleberry and a few others.  It is hard to find since it's in an industrial building in the back and there's no sign out front.  Also, it's kinda small so sometimes it's hard to get a seat.  I've actually seen people running to take a table that is being vacated!"}
{"text":"We have been here a handful of times but last night was the first time we decided to test out the menu. We had been putting off ordering food from here because we love the food at the FatHead's restaurant so much and we didn't want to not like the food at the tap house if that makes sense. The kitchen here is out in the open and only about as long as a few counters, so we didn't expect much. Boy were we surprised.  We started with the pub pretzel, it was huge! It came with nacho cheese, honey mustard, and wasabi headhunter mustard. This was my favorite part of the meal, I would definitely recommend you try this.   We also tried the 'gringo' pizza, it is essentially a taco pizza but with pulled pork instead of meat. For $9, this thing was huge! We took half of it home. I thought that the dough was a little undercooked, but no other complaints. We also tried the smokehouse wings, and they taste exactly like they do at the restaurant, despite the lack of kitchen! I was really impressed! I will be back now that I know the beer isn't the only good thing flowing here!"}
{"text":"A little known gem hidden away in the suburbs at the end of an industrial building. The beer here is fresh out of the stills and the food is fantastic. I prefer going here instead of the North Olmsted location. If you come, make sure you get the smoked wings in dry rub. Probably the best wings known to man. You won't be disappointed. Being an IPA guy, they always have 2-3 beers on tap that feed my Hop-craving desires. Head hunter is a go-to, but Hop Stalker and Hop Marauder have become favorites. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"what can i say, i love fat heads beer. i'm especially attached to their head hunter, though it definitely packs a punch. have been to this location twice, once just for a drink and once to also get food (pizza). would recommend this location over their restaurant location for ambiance alone... i just love drinking a beer or a flight next to the huge beer vats. if you're anywhere nearby, you should definitely stop in for a drink."}
{"text":"One of my very favorite breweries! Wish it wasn't 2000 Miles from home! Great beers across the range of styles. My favorites are Bumbleberry, Pumpkin Chucker Chocolate Stout, and Spooky Tooth Imperial Pumpkin Ale. We spent a couple of hours there having tasters, which necessitated our ordering some food.  I was floored by the quality of the chicken wings!!! Big smoky goodness. Best wings I have ever had...anywhere. Almost worth a special trip to Cleveland!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and even more amazing brews. They have a large menu of food and beers on draft. They are famous for their headwhiches aptly named because these sandwiches are giant! And they have a wide selection of their award winning beers available for samples, flights, by the glass, or in growlers so there is something for everyone. Good quality ingredients are used to make their food and the menu prices are very reasonable especially for the large portions they offer. The service is always excellent and the atmosphere is so much fun. It's always a great time spent at fat heads brewery. If you're local it's a must and if you're from out of town it is absolutely worth the trip.   Check out their website to see the latest beers on draft and what events are coming up"}
{"text":"If you love beer, and consider yourself a beer snob go here. The atmosphere is great, but if you are looking for a sit down place to have a meal just go to their main location.  This place is all about the beer!   Clean facilities, good food considering where you are, amazing beer, and friendly staff.    Don't expect a sports bar look and feel. You are not going to watch a Browns game here.    If you have a friend in from out of town take them here to experience the best tap house on the west side of Cleveland."}
