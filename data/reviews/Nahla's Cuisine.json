{"text":"Hands down the best middle eastern place around. Been here a few times now tried the chicken and beef shawarma as well as the Kofta and all were incredibly tasty. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken on the rocks and it was pretty bland, it's missing something. They give you really big pieces of chicken than the usual (which I didn't like). The garlic and tzatiki sauce weren't as flavorful as other places. The restaurant itself looks very clean."}
{"text":"This place is a little hidden gem, simple,clean, unassuming, freshly looking.   The owners and Chef were very nice and warm hearted.   The Shawarma was the best I had comparing to other places, juicy, tasty and just done right.  The Chef told me he selects and prepares the meat with his special recipes,  and specially made The hummus, and the soup.    I highly recommend it,  for a local dinner, a work lunch or even take outs."}
{"text":"I've been going to Osmos until I found this golden place! Food taste very authentic. Wow! I got the chicken shawarma platter with chicken shawarma poutine. Probably one of the best in Brampton."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if the reviews are fake or something but this place had some terrible food. I ordered chicken on the rocks and the chicken was terribly stale and filled with cartilage. Also ordered the falafel sandwich which was also sadly a disappointment, way too much garlic in it and doesn't taste like falafel. Definitely never eating here again; if your searching for a place where you can find some good quality food I assure you to keep searching."}
{"text":"Nahla's Cuisine catered a corporate breakfast at EY Law LLP today and it was PHENOMENAL!!  The food was so fresh and so tasty, my mouth is watering writing this review!  Definitely worth checking out for corporate catering events - my team was so happy to have some tasty, ethnic, and healthy food!  Thank you Nahla's Cuisine.  Also they were sooo punctual & professional; excellent service."}
{"text":"We had our work lunch catered from Nahla's Cuisine and the food was fresh and delicious. I have been craving the rice and shawarma ever since. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Disappointing. Topping selection is decent  and meat is cooked just right that's why I'll give it a two. But each time I've been there they have given me a broken pita and the most recent time this happened the woman tried to cover it with another piece of pita making my shawarma double the size in bread and then proceeded to grill it, when I got home to eat it, my original pita bread was not grilled and cold. Won't go back, definitely better shawarma in Brampton. Don't recommend"}
{"text":"I want to start by saying that I am Egyptian and very rarely eat at middle eastern restaurants because quite frankly, I'm usually disappointed and they are never as good as my own mother's cooking. With that being said, Nahla's cuisine far surpassed my expectations! The food was AMAZING and tasted like authentic middle eastern food. I tried the chicken panne, kufta, rice, potatoes, and salad. I even took the beef shawarma to try for lunch the next day and everything I had was delicious! I went so far as to ask about the chef because the food was so good and found out he's middle eastern and very meticulous when it comes to his cooking (he grounds his own meat and spices it himself). I strongly recommend you go and try this food out if you're in the area! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty average here, with the chicken being somewhat slightly above average.  The service and hospitality however and value are excellent and the only reason I may return, the owner is honestly a nice guy and is very friendly."}
{"text":"I made a yelp account just to say this: Nahla's shawarma poutine is the tits."}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean cuisine I've had, only because they make everything fresh AND with a smile. The menu is pretty standard but everything is delicious. This is the place I go to if I'm craving Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"Tried this place though we came for le kochi and there was 40 minutes waiting . Checked this place out , a chef owns the place and he explained the wraps to us and offered us middle eastern style nachos with some spicy sauce . Shawarma wrAp was okayish , 3/5 . Some more grilling need for wrAp and more meat n less salad I guess !"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place searching for Shawarma spots near my house. Omg!, am I ever happy this place popped up.  I am of Egyptian descent and I literally crave my cuisine weekly but because I haven't found a good authentic spot in Brampton I don't get to eat shawarma much.  I walked in and although the place is nothing special (decor wise), it does serve its purpose. Owner greeted me even though he was on the phone which was nice.   Lady behind the counter was very friendly, she even offered me a sample, a pita chip with some kind of dip. I refused it but it was a nice offering.  I ordered a chicken shawarma and it was TASTY! Their hot sauce is delish, I wonder if they make it themselves? Meat was tender and seasoned well.  The pita itself was of a good size, well stuffed. I can't tell you how many shawarma restaurant get stingy when stuffing. Price reflected the quality.  I'm looking forward to coming back and trying their other items. I didn't add any photos because I ate it in under three minutes, it was that tasty..."}
{"text":"Fresh and tasty food. We Had the falafel and the beef sandwich, both great. Will try dinner plate next time. Great service too. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is a great place. You can taste the freshness of the food. The friendliest? people that own the business. I hope this place gets the customers it deserves. I'm looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken shawarma platter and the chicken was dry and stale. The potatoes had no flavour to it. I would not recommend this place for shawarma. If you want a good shawarma platter go to pita land!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been pretty consistent customers to Nahla's since it opened.  We tried ordering delivery on a whim during the colder months and have kept reordering since!  We have transitioned to in store customers.  My father or myself will go in for pick up and their customer service is excellent (consistent, clean, friendly, speedy).  I would say that's a rare find when you compare it to the chain Middle Eastern joints (like Lazeez, Osmows, Ali Babas, Paramount, etc). What's great about the food is the taste and combination (potatoes and salad with the platter), freshness, portion sizes (honestly it's two meals in one)! I feel fortunate to live minutes away from Nahla's!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended to me by a number of people. Stepped in to place a lunch order for a large group on Saturday afternoon. Nahla guided me though the menu, made suggests as well as introduced me to the two gentlemen preparing the food. As I waited for our large order to be ready, the chef's brought over samples of their food for me to try. You could really tell how much pride they had in their food.   When the food was ready, I was pleasantly surprised to learn they threw in a few free extras, because they thought we would like it. All the food (chicken shawarma, beef shwarma, lamb kabab, chicken kabab, falafel, onion salsa, and pita chips) were delicious. Generous portions and fantastic taste. Will definitely be back and will absolutely use them for catering future events."}
