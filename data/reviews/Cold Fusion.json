{"text":"If I could give it zero stars I would. Didn't eat here but witnessed the owner chastise an upset patron who was rightfully upset. He embarrassed her and demeaned her in front of his other patrons. Unapologetic for his errors and then on top to humiliate the customer? Unacceptable."}
{"text":"The food here is outstanding.  The three stars is due to the quality of the waitresses, actually one in particular.   Since she did not introduce herself, I do not know her name.  I asked what was on tap and was told \"lots of stuff\".  Thanks, but that does not help at all.  Fortunately, on this day it was slow so another waitress also stopped and check up on us.  Her name was Jill and she was great.  Very helpful and attentive.  The owner even stopped by to see how we were doing.  This was unexpected but appreciated.  I plan on returning for the food, but hope there is an improvement in the wait staff."}
{"text":"We stumbled on this place while looking for a place to eat before peeing our pants at Wisconsin Scaryland. With all the neon beer signs decorating the windows, we expected nothing more than pub food.   What a nice surprise to find not only a full menu, but attentive and friendly service. 5 stars on that aspect! I ordered the prime rib special and my companion got the ribs. My order was just OK; it satisfied my craving for red meat, but was a little overcooked and in the tough side.    The ribs were another story altogether. Marinated overnight with a delightful fusion of bbq and mango chutney, they were flavorful and fell off the bone. The wine selection was limited but above average, and there was a fine selection of local craft beers.  I will definitely be making a repeat visit for the ribs and the outstanding service!"}
{"text":"Outstanding service (4th star fir that alone). Looks like a sports bar inside n out. Menu has many unique fusion combos. Super interesting veriety. Ribs had a great chutney sauce,  but no smoke flavor. Will definitely give this place another try."}
{"text":"Went there for a Friday fish fry.  The service was less than excellent and that was the best thing.  I got the baked fish and it was almost chewy.  My friend ordered a burger, medium and the entire middle was still raw.  Then to make matters worse, when the waitress split the check, not only did we notice the bill for my friend's meal was attached to my card and mine to his, she ended up charging me for BOTH bills!  Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Went back to Cold Fusion to see what the dinner menu was like. First off the bartender was one of the worst. A tall guy who looked out of place here in Middleton with his dirty jeans and jersey shirt. He also had no clue on bartending. He walked by our part of the bar twice with us waiving and didn't even look up. We finally had to YELL at him to get his attention. Later he didn't notice three of us needed refills and we decided to wait until we were seated to order another drink. Bad first impression. The good is that the waitstaff at the tables was very attentive and the food was very good.I had the ribs and chicken dinner. Perfectly done and served with some good coleslaw and mashed potatoes. The ribs could have used a little something to add some kick to it but all in all pretty good. Others at our table had pasta dishes that passed the test as well. Without the bar experience I still say give this place a chance. We need more restaurants on this side of town."}
{"text":"Fish fry was too oily..Chicken wings was also full of bones."}
{"text":"Came Friday for the fish fry. Have to say it was one of the best i have had in the area. My husband had the Cajun pasta. Being from New Orleans he raved about it. Can't wait to go back. Staff was great."}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic! I've been to the cold fusion in Platteville a couple times and have gone here for lunch and everything I've had is delicious! There's a lot of menu items and the choices can be really overwhelming but everything I've tried so far has been incredible so I doubt you can go wrong.  Great place for watching sports as well! Tons of tvs"}
{"text":"With the whirlwind of the second Hurricane Katrina, thou shalt find the deep conversations of the Fourth World War with men in slit pants and black decks on hand! Booyah!  Here's a salty surprise.  P.S. Booba got no oil"}
{"text":"Wow I can't believe the reviews here! Been to cold fusion twice. First let me say the manager is a class act and provides great service as does the wait staff but the food ... maybe I hit the place on the wrong nights but I can guarantee there was no chef in the kitchen when I was there! We tried the full dinner the first time and for the price expected something tasty and well prepared, but no such luck. The second time we tried the sandwiches and we were just as underwhelmed. They have the right idea as far as the variety of the menu and the cool recipes but the quality of the ingredients is so sub-par that I could not finish my meal on both occasions. Sandwich bun was mediocre and soggy, mashed potatoes had no flavor except for some type of chicken broth taste, weird. I mean, for this kind of tab I could have a great dinner at Sardines, Tempest or Pig in a Fur Coat. They really need to step it up in the kitchen!"}
