{"text":"Horrible place food sucks and deserts are worse everything is frozen Costco bought then served to you as a gourmet meal even the pizza was frozen store bought"}
{"text":"We came at night. The place was about 90% full. The service was horrible. I tried to give them a chance by thinking maybe theyre just short staffed but after watching the servers just stand around I changed my mind.

I got the brownie with ice cream. The brownie tasted old and store bought. I had it with strawberry ice cream but the ice cream didnt taste good either. When they had brought my order they forgot utensils. I had to ask twice for utensils. By the time i got it, my ice cream was about half melted.

You're better off going to Demetres."}
{"text":"I was at Spin this past Tuesday evening with 10 family members. I made reservations about 2 hours ahead. The staff was sooooo courteous and helpful. They gave us a table at the back for more privacy. The waitress was prompt, cheerful and helpful. There was a wide choice of desserts for everyone to be satisfied. We had a great evening. I recommend this place and this occasion for anyone who is looking for a place to get together with people for coffee and dessert. Don't hesitate....you will get service, great food and a pleasant atmosphere."}
{"text":"I often come here for desserts because it's kind of close to where I live. The serving size is definitely smaller than Demetres, but it doesn't disappoint overall. I feel like the serving size is much more doable here and I like the taste of their desserts much better as well. The drinks are fab too!
Another thing that I like about this place is that the atmosphere and decor is ace. It can get a bit busy during the evening, but i always try to avoid their busy times. It's a bit pricier than most dessert places, but I think that the overall experience makes up for it."}
{"text":"Terrible service...go to Demetries instead! Spin is over priced, over rated. There was a fluff on my plate and a they did was wipe it away... Why could they make me a new dessert altogether?! Urgh! Customer service is horrible... I wouldn't give them one star ... They don't deserve any stars!"}
{"text":"I decided to go to Spin Cafe again last night. After having a great experience the last time. 
Loved it!! Again!! Tried the \"sugar sugar\" waffle. So good. I love cake batter cookie dough ice cream. Love it!!
Service was great.  Very helpful and nice wait staff.  
The server offered me a sample of the monthly feature. It was good. But cake batter cookie dough is better. 
Can't wait to try next month feature ice cream. 
I have to check out Thursday nights. I heard from people there that they host \"open mic night\"."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from a few friends and they loved it. So I decided to check it out for myself. Went with my boyfriend on a thursday afternoon, and it was pretty empty, maybe just a couple of other customers. The servers were super friendly and sweet, and the place looked nice as well, very black and pink. I got the salted caramel cheesecake, which came with scoops of vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce. My boyfriend got one of their decadent dessert selection called \"back in time\" in a crepe. He got it with white chocolate ice cream, and it came with brownie pieces and hot fudge sauce. The food was delicious, and we enjoyed it. We are not dessert people, so it was pretty heavy for both of us. But if you have a sweet tooth, you will definetly enjoy it, so give it a try :)"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of their crepes but the waffles are delicious. Also, way too much powdered sugar around the edges of the plate; it ended up falling onto the table. Overall, this place has yummy dessert options and the hot chocolate is great!"}
{"text":"I read a bunch of negative reviews about the service at this place, but I really needed a sugar fix and this was all that was open nearby. The food was great, the service was awesome, our server Febe was great, so just make sure to get her and you won't be leaving a bad review."}
{"text":"Good food. Usually empty depending on the time. Customer service was decent based on other reviews I guess we got lucky. We had waffle with hazelnut ice cream and it was pretty good. No complaints."}
{"text":"I have been to this location many times, but the service today was amazing. They had run out of almond milk - a substitute I require due to a severe lactose intolerance - and would have been unable to construct my almond milk steamer. The gentleman helping us, who I believe was the manager, realized my disappointment (despite my not making a fuss) and said he'd find a way. He had someone go to the neighbouring grocery store and pick one up! Although this seems like something most establishments would do should they run out of a staple ingredient, they usually don't. I was so impressed and will definitely be back. Thank you so much for making my day. This type of customer service is rare and deserves to be acknowledged. 

All the best!"}
{"text":"Food Quality & Price: I purchased a Groupon that offered $20 value for $10. On average, a dessert crepe dish was $9.15 (some higher some lower).  Breakfast and Savoury crepes range in the same area.  In comparison to Demetres, it's slightly cheaper.  The quality of the crepes were GREAT. Ice cream is wrapped inside each crepe (presented beautifully) in comparison to Demetres who just tosses the crepe on top. I had the \"Say it Right\" dessert crepe (Dulce the Leche ice cream with chocolate shavings. Absolutely divine! I was very impressed with the quality of the crepes as well. Thin, warm, not overly sweet. Delicious. 

Facility: Interesting hot pink decor. As another review said, there was one circle booth that stuck out randomly, not sure if that was VIP or what... Anyway, interior is modern and clean... if not very pink. You have a lovely view of the back alley or the parking lot lol. Atmosphere was very quiet on the Sunday afternoon. Other than us, there was maybe two other \"couples\" or \"pairs\" there.  Music was loud and then got quiet, loud then quiet. Not sure why. There IS free wifi at this location though one of the staff gave us a \"run around\". However, wifi signal was horrible... one bar.  I ended up just using my data.

Service: On a Sunday afternoon, only two men were working. The one who received us and took us to our booth was very slow. I think he was the only one cooking though. It took the staff 5 - 10 minutes to come and take our order. Our server was Ron.  When Ron took over, it went very smoothly. He was attentive and efficient. 

Overall: A nice place to go if you want a change from noisy and crowded Demetres.  I will likely return to sample the breakfast or savoury crepes (which Demetres no longer offers). Price is slightly cheaper than Demetres and the quality is better. The only downside was the time it took for someone to realize we wanted to order."}
{"text":"Love this place but prices are kinda expensive compared to similar themed cafes"}
{"text":"When we step into this restaurant, it doesn't has anyone there.  The waitresses are talking to each other at the corner.  There is a left behind birthday cake on a table near the fireplace.  It seems odd that we disrupt the quietness.  We order crepes and only crepes do we want to try here.  The Chicken Presto with mushrooms, spinach and melted cheese tasted unexpectedly good.  The crepe wrap itself is one of a kind.  We ask if the breakfast menu can be ordered and the waitress is kind enough to let us know that everything can be customized.  We then order the Egg Crepe with ham and beacon, mushroom and potatoes on the side.  

Once finished, oh we have to order more.  The Irreplacable with strawberries and sauce is unbeatable and we customize it with coconut ice cream.  The scoop is huge.  What a pleasant night with so many crepes all at once!  

As we are leaving, I can see people are coming for their desserts."}
{"text":"Service was horrible... they forgot to bring me water so i had to ask twice and when i got it, it was warm... waiter dripping with sweat, chefs dont wear gloves when handling food... left our dessert on the counter for 5 minutes before bringing it to us so it was soggy when we got it... my boyfriend gave them a one dollar tip that they didnt even deserve."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times before. I brought some friends with me and was sorely dissappointed. The ice cream and waffle cone were good but don't come when they are busy. Staff aren't able to handle the flow of guests. My group of 4 was waiting 45 min and a party of 5 before us waited even longer. They sat 2 groups ahead of us who came in later. The two groups where also a party of 5 and 4. Which didn't make sense as those two groups that were seated had come in after us to get seats.  When we went to complain, I noticed my name crossed out and no one had called for my party. I was standing in front of the cake display, so I would have heard my name being called. The server said some guy used my name and gave a lukewarm apology. It was odd because our party was made up of asians and the party before us that was still waiting was made up of a visible minority(black and asian group). The two groups that got seated ahead of us were Caucasian. What does this tell me about their service?"}
{"text":"A good desert, better than demetres with great presentation and even better a taste. My fiance and I went there on a whim just to get some ice cream, and instead, we went into a really cozy cafe and enjoyed a good size sundae.

As other people have mentioned...the prices are definitely a bit more expensive than expected out of a desert cafe, but the decor and the furniture makes the place look a lot fancier than a dessert chain cafes around.

Definitely worth the little bit extra to enjoy a cozy dessert date with that special someone....."}
{"text":"If you are in a hurry, on a budget, or a visible minority, this place isn't for you.

I can't argue with the fact that their house-made ice cream and waffle cones are to die for. But are they worth being discriminated for?
I say nay nay.

Spoiler alert...their service is sluggish (even more so when it's busy), and their prices are sky high...we're talkin' charity banquet prices here.

But what's even worse is that their staff doesn't seem to have any problem with letting groups of visible minorities stand and wait in line to be seated while they let groups of non-visible minorities waltz right in and seat themselves.

So unless you build a time machine, win the lottery, change your skin tone, and take those waltz lessons that you've been meaning to take, you're probably better off taking a 'Spin' and going somewhere else.

{"text":"Note: This review is strictly based on customer service. Unfortunately I didn't get as far as ordering any food or drinks.

I walked in last night and the place was packed. My boyfriend and I stood for about two minutes right beside the \"please wait to be seated\" sign waiting for the staff (who crossed our path several times) to just acknowledge that we were standing there. Two minutes (which actually feels like forever) come and go and nothing. I get that they're busy, but a simple smile, some eye contact, or an \"I'll be right with you\" would have done wonders! Customer service 101. Eventually I had to go seek out staff and ask if they were even open, or if maybe I happened upon a private event. I told one of the girls behind the counter that we were waiting to be seated and she just said \"it just seems like people are seating themselves tonight\"... um, WHAT? Whatever. Peace out, Spin. Get your act together."}
{"text":"This place is a knock off version of Demetre's with zero respect for allergies.

My boyfriend and I came here and ordered a milkshake and sundae. After my boyfriend  tried a few sips of the milkshake he thought there was a bit of an almond flavour, which he's allergic to (maybe almond milk?) Moments later his lips were visibly swollen so we called over our waitress and apologized for possibly not paying attention to the ingredients but we would have to send back the milkshake. We didn't even ask for another one, we just didn't want that one and the waitress shut us down so quickly stating there are no nuts in the drinks and that we were wrong. How can we be wrong if there was a minor allergic reaction happening right before our eyes?  She rolled her eyes took our milkshake and then came back to tell us she was \"right\" because she spoke to the chef and nothing was in it.

If you're up for being bullied by your waitress while eating a mediocre dessert amongst tacky decor, this is definitely where you want to go!"}
{"text":"This place is clean with a fun atmosphere. The food here is phenomenal, I've been here many times and has never been disappointed. Everything from their savory crepes and pizzas to their cakes and ice creams have been amazing. Their prices are a little on the high side, but worth it. Kids love this place. I would recommend making a reservation if you plan on coming on the weekend, it gets busy."}
{"text":"A bit pricey, but I liked the food.

The biggest complaint I have is there is no price on the menus for the ice cream.  Spoiler alert: it's $5.50 a scoop!  Granted, it was a large scoop, but still, that's a lot of green for some cream.

I also had the veggie goat cheese pizza, it was pretty good.  The crust was thin and a little soft in the middle (a bit like me), but the toppings had a good flavor."}
{"text":"I've been here not even five minutes and not impressed. The customer service is just not there. I am waiting for friends but they could ask if I want a drink  or water at least !!!! 

We had reservations and just walked out because they couldn't accommodate us properly because they were worried about fitting other people. We all walked out !

Sometimes the food isn't worth it if the service already leaves a bad taste in your mouth !"}
{"text":"Came on a Tuesday night for dessert. Wasn't busy at all. Service was fast.  Huge portion of ice cream."}
{"text":"Yummy crepes & Belgian waffles ! Waffles were yummy and desserts were fresh. Decent customer service! You may have to seat yourself though. Lots of seating, pretty casual feel- seating not as nice as say Demetres! But if you're in the area I would stop by again! Open late which is a bonus !"}
{"text":"Location: 7600 Weston Road Vaughan ON L4L 9L9
Price:$$
Service: ehhh

So feeling adventurous tonight- a friend and I thought we'd try Spin if it is any better than Demetres... I was really hoping to like this place and it would be my new dessert place. It wasn't.

Irresistible (crepes and strawberries) and red velvet cake (w/ice cream) was ordered. Needless to say both were just okay... But, I really did like their crepes- it was the right texture. Other than that this dessert place is nothing spectacular. I like Demetres better to be honest. 

They had wifi but it wasn't turned on until we asked... Awkward! The connection was extremely slow and it didn't work either when it was turned on. 

The service was alright. It seemed like the server wanted us to leave. She tried to clean our table when we were still eating. We came at 6:30pm...there were plenty of empty tables! So why are we rushed?! I don't know. 

Verdict: Not 1st choice"}
{"text":"I always love visiting Spin! The atmosphere is incredible and so is the service. It's always a pleasure satisfying my tastebuds with freshly made crepes and mouth watering cheese cake. Their generous portions will most certainly have you coming back for more!"}
{"text":"After my previous 2 star rating, Woodbridge Spin has redeemed itself in my Yelp book on the basis of an unplanned Mother's Day visit.  The restaurant we actually went to first turned out to be closed, and the only place that seemed to fit the bill as a comparable alternative was Spin.  

It was a real surprise to see how slow business was on Mother's Day.  Maybe they had an early crowd and another one later, but for the considerable amount of time we were there (likely 1.5 hours at least) at lunch time, business was amazingly light.  The way I'd been bracing myself for Mother's Day Madness, this was a welcome (and, perhaps counter-intuitively, auspicious) beginning.

Between the 3 of us, we started with a Peach Lemonade, Rolo Way Latte, and one regular brewed coffee.  The Peach Lemonade was pretty good - wasn't sickly sweet and didn't taste too artificial.  The Rolo Way Latte appeases those who need to shut up a sweet tooth.  BF liked it enough to order a second one so his sweet teeth were clearly very happy with it.  My brewed coffee, unfortunately, was the typically acidic/bitter restaurant standard that isn't the good standard, but the server was attentive and I never had a shortage, so I got what I wanted i.e. quantity over quality.  My requests for lots of creamers and sugar were dutifully filled each time and I knew that it would be typical bleh-grade restaurant coffee anyway.  If they do manage to brew good coffee in the future, it might bring the place up to 5 stars!

Our main dishes consisted of the Chicken Pesto crepe, Mediterranean Salad (with chicken option added as an extra), and a Bacon and Egg crepe.  Daughter and BF were satisfied with their crepes, and I know from past experience that crepes here tend to have very good quality filling ingredients which are nicely cooked inside a decent crepe.  My Mediterranean Salad was excellent - fresh, crisp greens, grape tomatoes, sliced black olives, cucumber, red pepper, goat cheese (which I prefer to typical feta in salad), and grilled, juicy chicken slices.  The only thing I would change was the onion, which would have been far better if it was red onion.  The dressing was a fresh-tasting vinaigrette which was pretty good - you can taste the oregano and it's not too acidic.  They made a friend with that salad!

We went all out and each had our own dessert - a That's What I Like, We Will Rock You, and I Like It Like That.  One of them (I think it was the That's What I Like) was from the May promotional menu featuring raspberries, which we had with a waffle added.  The vanilla ice cream was rich and silky with a light, bright-tasting, raspberry ribbon, the raspberry syrup tasted like it was made with real raspberries, the made-to-order waffle was a light yet crispy on the outside texture, and the cheesecake cubes, juicy, real raspberries, and real whipped cream put it on the top of the chart.  I think mine was the I Like It Like That, which I took in a crepe.  Another ginormous scoop of ice cream (this one chocolate peanut butter), and a whole sliced banana topped with chunks of Reese peanut butter cups and chocolate sauce, plus the warm chocolate syrup and real whipped cream.  The chocolate peanut butter ice cream was a beautiful blend of just the right level of chocolate and nicely sweetened peanut butter - OMG yes, did I Like It Like That.  We Will Rock You (if I got the names connected correctly) is with (Tiramisu?) ice cream, which my daughter also took with a crepe and comes with pieces of almond biscotti, chocolate shavings, and warm syrup along with the requisite real whipped cream.  The little chocolate shavings somehow don't seem to be the same standard as everything else but that might really be splitting hairs. My taste buds were probably way overloaded by that point but the Tiramisu ice cream tasted a little too subtle for me to appreciate right away.  By the time we were ready to roll away home and I managed to eat the last bit of it that remained, I thought I might have to try it with uncorrupted taste buds another time.

The server was nicely attentive the entire visit, topping up water and coffee regularly.  The one glitch with the side Caesar salad served instead of the requested garden salad was quickly rectified.  And, not only did I miraculously miss Mother's Day Madness in a restaurant, they presented a fresh cut flower at the end of our visit.  IDK if I can count on these lucky stars in the future here, but after this pleasant surprise visit, we plan to come back again!  I sincerely hope the next experience will be as good as this one was."}
{"text":"The desserts here are so good! I took my 14 yr old son and his friend and they were in heaven. All three of us went with the crepes and ice cream instead of waffles and were stuffed! We probably should have shared since none of us ate the entire plate. I have to admit that I had to force myself to stop eating. It was so good but I knew I'd feel awful later had I finished the entire dessert plate. We will definitely be back but will not make this a regular outing. It's calorie overload! Definitely a fun dessert idea to bring friends."}
{"text":"I was in that group that Edwin mentions in his review, and boy or boy did these guys screw up. I didn't have a big problem waiting for a seat since we were an unannounced group of 10 that showed up when they were busy, but saying that, they failed to mention how long the wait would be, and the entrance area was hot as hell, so not a comfortable waiting experience. 
And this waiting experience continued after we were ushered in to our seats, it took a good long time to get our orders, and the longest time I've had to wait for water to get to a table. And then with no warning they turn on all their lights in a very club-esque manner to indicate that it was time to get going. But wait....we had yet to receive our food/drinks! And then after a quick word with the servers and finding out that they had yet to even start on our orders (which were mainly drinks and the odd dessert item) after a solid 20 - 30 minutes after had given our orders in, it was a no brainer that the best course of action for us would be to leave. 

While I cannot comment on how good or bad their food is, prices here did seem to be a little higher than I would have liked to spend regardless, but from the few dishes the kitchen did send out in our hour there, it did seem like the portion sizes were pretty big. I can definitely say that I will not be coming here any time soon after the horrendous customer service they displayed."}
{"text":"Came here after midnight for a late night desert more then once.  If you love anything Nutella  then u will love it here. Great stuff and good selection of deserts and drinks. Oh you can get Nutella in with your drink too ! Added it to my regular places to visit. Came here another time with 10 people and they did well in putting out food in a timely manners. So bring ur friends too !"}
{"text":"Came here for coffee. Great environment, but a little quiet for a Friday night... Also they seem to have had gelato at some point but it looks like the tray is empty.

However the latte was great and we had a nice time. Peaceful and neat, with good music. I think most people here were in a good mood, and the cake looked good so thumbs up to them!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Tuesday night and ordered the teriyaki crepe, it was very tasty. I then ordered a waffles for dessert which were topped with strawberries and whipped cream which was delicious! 
The food took a while for it to come out but it made up for it in taste, and the staff was also very sweet."}
{"text":"I can't speak for others but in my opinion: Spin is a great place to get a specialty hot drink or have a dessert night.

Imagine if you will a demetres cafe with actual customer service and prompt orders! Sounds amazing, doesn't it?! Getting waffles/crepes with ice cream and not having to wait around for an angry waiter to drop your bill after a 30minute wait. 

I always have the London fog: earl grey, steamed milk and vanilla. The King of Teas!
Their savoury food is good too! We ordered the Canadian pizza and it was great. Im glad they offer savoury food options (sometimes you don't actually want sweet and change your mind as soon as you sit down at the restaurant...or is that just me? ) 

Give them a try- they gave a great location with tons of parking and really friendly staff."}
{"text":"Whenever I go to Spin, usually after D&Bs nearby, I choose to get the \"Charlie Brown\" on a waffle or crepe. Basically my favourite flavour of all time, mint chocolate! Or here, they call it their peppermint patty ice cream with andes chocolate mint swirls and fudge brownie bits along with a side serving of fudge sauce to pour on yourself.

Minus one star because its a bit messy here, not enough servers to go around to clean after the tables. Also can be a bit slow on both getting seated and being served... But would recommend when you are looking for late night dessert in this area of Vaughan, especially when you want a deadly sweet decadent one that is similar to Demetres.

Also its expensive for just ice cream and waffles, almost $15 after taxes, although the scoop of ice cream is big."}

{"text":"Went here around 9pm, it was a full house so I had hopes that this dessert place is good but nope. Me and my boyfriend order two different waffles with ice cream, one had pistachio ice cream and mine had velvet. My velvet ice cream was just \"okay\", nothing special. I tried my boyfriend's pistachio ice-cream, it was just gross, it didn't taste like pistachio but something foreign. The waffles were cold, dry and bland. Definitely not worth the time and money to revisit this place"}
{"text":"Love their ice cream. The texture is different than the other ice cream we normally eat. The crepe is freshly made once you order so it's always hot. 

It's good for you to come here after having dinner and want to have something sweet!

We tried the strawberry ice cream but next time we would like to try pistachio flavour cause it's the most popular one in the store!"}
{"text":"Having just reviews Spin Dessert Cafe - Scarborough, I thought I'd also review this location. Been here a few times, and my experiences were decent. The desserts are good, better than Cafe Demetre if you ask me. 

But I have some issues with this location. First of all it is way too busy whenever I go in. For me this is a problem because I hate waiting (but will patiently wait my turn when I have to), and I hate bad (or non-existent) service. When it is busy, the service is slower - which makes sense but I don't like it. Don't get me wrong though, the wait staff is great and always cheerful. I just cannot deal with slow service. Maybe they need to have more wait staff on hand during busy times.

For a franchise, this Spin location is very different from it's Scarborough brethren. They feel like different places, though decor is uniform, the vibe is different. This location has more of a Cafe Demetre feel because its so big and has such high consumer traffic.

Personally I prefer the Scarborough location but you will not be disappointed by this Spin location. Great for large groups, just make sure you make your reservations early."}
{"text":"Visited spin for the first time on a Friday night around 8:30 the place wasn't too busy but it wasn't empty.  They played current pop music and had friendly staff. I thought the menu had a nice selection something for those who like to keep it simple and something for those who like to try something different. 

I got the sugar sugar crêpe. A crêpe filed with chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream with brownies and cookie dough bits on the side and chocolate sauce. My mother got the California dream. A crêpe filed with pina colada ice cream white chocolate coconut and white chocolate sauce. Both selections can be served in a crêpe or on a waffle.

We both enjoyed our desserts they were delicious and the  crepes were perfect not too sweet or saugy.  They serve the sauces on the side so you can decide how much you want,  which is nice."}
{"text":"Nothing outstanding about the place, can be summed up as a demetre duplicate with more cake options.

We got the peanut pie cake and the chocolate fudge cake, the serving size was huge, it was good, a tad on the sweet side, nothing very unique about the cake.

The biggest let down was the service, we couldn't figure out who our server was, one person had us sit down, the other took the order, somebody else brought us food and another person brought the bill.

it took them at least 15 minutes to bring us the bill after we asked for it, and we had to ask twice.

the seating space is very crammed, two groups on our both sides and our tables were barely seperated."}
{"text":"I loved coming here, getting a nice latte and then ice cream on a waffle, or crepe, or a sundae.
Up until maybe a month ago when after receiving my latte - it was in the smallest cup I'd ever seen a latte in!!
I questioned the manager I think he was, and he said it's the same size as before, just taller...umm no, I'm not an idiot thank you, after a few sips it shouldn't be finished, and I can clearly see the depth of the cup when it is empty.
It is a larger sized espresso cup, and for lattes to be about $5, come on...use a regular sized cup if you want customers to have an experience where they are impressed and want to come back.
I guess that's another regular customer you just lost to Demetres and Symposium around the corner!"}
{"text":"After dinner last night, I was craving for dessert! Our Yelp app brought us to SPIN as it was close to where we had dinner. I ordered the crepe with strawberries and banana with nutella (in my opinion, there was just too much nutella everywhere! I know, hard to believe but I found that it was all over my crepe on the outside and inside). My boyfriend ordered a slice of their white chocolate, raspberry cheese cake which came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. We also both ordered black coffees. The decor in the restaurant is modern and a great place for a first date or gathering with friends. The service was a tad slow (not so much for ourselves but for the poor family who was sitting beside us that did not get their drinks or orders taken for a good 15 minutes). They also ran out of water glasses when we arrived so we didn't get water until later which I had to also remind the waiter for. The prices for the cakes and crepe were expensive - around $10 each. For the two of us, our total was around $30. I did appreciate how they had many options for desserts, lots of ice cream to choose from (I wish they had a sorbet though) and options for soy/almond milks for their specialty drinks. The restaurant was very full and busy for a Saturday night and had good energy."}
{"text":"After visiting the Spin location in Etobicoke the week prior, and absolutely adoring it, I was super excited to check out the Vaughan location. I came late one Saturday night with a group of friends and the place was PACKED, the wait was over an hour so we hung our heads and drove over to Dairy Queen and nommed on some cheapie blizzards instead.

I came back shortly thereafter on the Monday of the Victoria Day long weekend and there was tons of space. We excitedly ordered the Fondue for Two, a smoothie, and a shake.

Our drinks came after a small wait.

Strawberry Banana Smoothie - Good! Not the best smoothie I've ever had, but still a tasty treat.
Frozen White Hot Chocolate - Is that a bit of an oxymoron, \"frozen hot chocolate?\" :) Regardless, it was hella tasty. Refreshing, and totally satisfies your sweet craving. 
Fondue for two - I was soooo excited for this because I adore fondue. After a bit of a lengthy wait, I was sorely disappointed when this arrived at our table.  The chocolate fondue sauce was COLD. Like, not even a little warmed up. It came with a little tea candle that would in no way ever make the fondue warm. It was pretty sad looking. Also, the fondue is supposed to come with strawberries and cheesecake for dipping, but instead of cheesecake we received waffle cone pieces. They didn't even tell us that they were out of cheesecake until we asked why we received waffle cone pieces (which, really, were not that great.) When we asked to send it back the girl made a bit of a fuss because \"it was already made.\" She eventually checked with the manager who okayed it.

Overall, a pretty disappointing experience. Service was definitely absent and lackluster. I think I'll be sticking to the Queensway location!"}
{"text":"Upon entering there is a full display of cakes which they carry. I was craving a Red Velvet cake and saw that there was a full Red Velvet cake which was pre-sliced. Not one single slice was missing (You will understand later why I make a point about there not being a single slice missing).

The slice of cake was $10.50 which included some vanilla ice cream. The price is in a category of its own. Next level expensive. Super Saiyan level expensive. (I can't believe I'm refering to Dragonball in one of my reviews). I think the most expensive slice of cake I had prior to this was a $9 cheese cake which tasted amazing. So with this kind of price tag I am expected to be blown away. What we get instead is a glob of ice cream placed on top of the Red Velvet cake and another glob put on the side. Yes, a GLOB. Not a scoop which is what you would expect. Terrible presentation. 

The cake itself tasted just as bad as the presentation. The cake was dry, the cream didn't taste anything like it should. Did not even have a hint of the cream cheese flavour it should have. Simply one of the worst cakes I have had. To make things worse, when we left we saw the Red Velvet cake which was on display and it still had not a single slice missing. So either we were served days, possible weeks old cake or the cake they have on display upfront are fake and just for show. I'm pretty sure we were served old cake as it tasted that way. 

WOW.....I'm glad I vented all that out and got that off my chest. 

I also got a Rolo flavoured latte which tasted good but I didn't taste any Rolo. It just tasted like a Hazelnut latte in my opinion. The drink is worth some stars but the cake....STAY AWAY."}
{"text":"I came here after an early dinner on Saturday at about 6PM with one other table which was nice as I heard it gets quite busy at night.

Upon our arrival, the smell of chocolate, ice cream, freshly made waffles and crepes was divine! I was surprised to see on the menu that they offer a large variety of foods, not just dessert and cakes.. they also have breakfast/savoury crepes.

After a long and hard debate (as everything on the menu made me salivate), we got:

- Pillow talk crepe (~$12): Tiramisu ice cream, I did not enjoy this one too much as I felt the rum taste as too strong
- Scarlett waffle (~$13): Red velvet ice cream, I really enjoyed this one.. minus the weird tasting runny white sauce which we did not use

Overall, I would come back here over Demetres as they claim to make the ice cream in house, as well as the cakes."}
{"text":"Food was delicious...until I got food poisoning. I am not sure how they did it but it is terrible. I feel absolutely awful and will NOT go back. I have ever before been so sick. I went last night with my cousin and actually had a pleasant experience until I woke up in the middle of the night swearing and with chills and sick to my stomach. I had to go to the emergency room."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night and it was packed. So obviously you would expect service to be slow which it was. I think we waited 20-30 mins for our order to come. We had multiple servers bring wrong orders to our table as if they had no idea where the tables were.
In terms of food, I ordered \"I'm a believer\" which consisted of hazelnut ice cream, roasted hazelnuts, bananas and a hazelnut sauce. All I can say is that it was delicious! 
I'll probably be trying their crepes/waffles next time but also coming on a night when its less busy."}
{"text":"Came here for my sister's birthday lunch. The place wasn't packed. It was about a quarter full on a weekend lunch. I was never a big fan of savoury crepes until I tried one here. It was delectable. The server didn't really come around much, but that's understandable. We were engaged in our own conversations and didn't need much. Water was always refilled before we asked for it. A great experience. Price point wasn't bad either."}
{"text":"Went for brunch, ordered vegetable egg crepe, it was cold when it came.  The potatoes which it came with were partly frozen and not fresh at all.  Someone ordered a spinach and egg crepe and the spinach wasn't even Sauted.  Really not impressed."}
{"text":"I have come here with my wife a couple of times and my experience has been nothing but great.... They always accommodate my peanut allergy... They can be busy but overall great place and good times"}
{"text":"Just spent 15 minutes at a table in the centre of the restaurant not being greeted, brought water or my order taken. People that literally just walked in have received service which is unacceptable when there are other patrons who have been waiting. There is more staff than guests and considering this is my first visit I will never be returning. It is not so busy that there is an adequate excuse for this lack of service. Walked out after 15-20 minutes of waiting."}
{"text":"I have heard quite a bit about Spin through word-of-mouth. My friend and I wanted to meet up so I decided on Spin because it was convenient for us. I was told that the food was even better than Caffe Demetre (which was literally a minute away from Spin), so my standards were set high because I absolutely loved Caffe Demetre.

We arrived past 7 PM and were waited on by a cute waiter, who attended to us quite often. It was a bit empty when we first arrived but we settled quickly as my friend and I had a lot of catching up to do. I decided to go for a dessert crepe because I already had dinner waiting for me at home so I didn't want to spend on dinner food. I was flipping between I Like It Like That (Chocolate peanut butter ice-cream topped with Reese's mini cups, bananas and hot fudge on the side) or You Rock My World (Sticky toffee ice-cream topped with Skor Toffee pieces, white chocolate curls and hot caramel sauce on the side). I asked the waiter to help me decide and he recommended I Like It Like That, so I took up on his advice. My friend ordered one of the savoury crepes called Thai Express.

When our orders came, I was indifferent to my order. It seemed like it could be replicated elsewhere but better. Maybe because I have been spoiled by the luxuries of Caffe Demetre for the past few years. I would not say it was spectacular and it tasted exactly how I would expect it to taste. I sorta wished I tried You Rock My World instead. I did manage to sample my friend's Thai Express and I preferred her dish over mine.

We noticed that it started to get busy closer to 9 PM. While we were talking, the waiter asked why my friend looked sad (she was just pondering for a moment). He asked if it was her birthday (it wasn't) and he promptly brought out a red velvet cupcake for her! I was quite envious, but I give Spin 5/5 for customer service! Nothing beats a free cupcake, haha.

When it got busy, the service to our table did slow down considerably. Which wasn't too bad since I don't like to constantly be bothered at a restaurant. Though in the end it did take awhile for our bill and change to get back to us.

If you sign up with your phone number, you will get a free drink the next time you visit. After that, a free drink after every ten times you visit. So basically it's an electronic loyalty card using your cell number. I thought that was pretty cool. Apparently you should get a notice once you have been inserted into their system. It has been three days but I still haven't received anything...

So my overall verdict is yeah, I would probably go back. I just hope the next item tastes a lot more mouth-watering or unique."}
{"text":"Good service and I found the desserts to be better than the nearby Demetre. Though my friend did say the ice cream tastes cheap."}
{"text":"I really like Spin cafes and generally prefer them over other dessert cafes cause the items here are not as sweet. I usually pick something from the waffle/crepe selection or a milkshake. I tried a savoury item once and wasn't impressed so I stay away from that side of the menu. The service here can also be a hit or miss."}
{"text":"This is the most depressing Spin Dessert Cafe I have been to..

I really want to like this place, but everything just a falling short aside from our lone waiter who was trying really really hard ..

I have the So Much To Say ($9.15) Crepe - Hazelnut Creme ice-cream layered with bananas and roasted hazelnuts with hot hazelnut sauce on the side. I have nothing much to say aside from it was OK, I doubt I will order that again.

\"Freshly Brewed\" Free Trade Coffee ($1.95) tasted like it had been brewed a long time ago.. thick and muddy.

My Yelp friend ordered the Tip of the Iceberg ($5.75) which is an affogato and seems to be quite delicious.

Wifi was not working at all even there was a signal. Service was painfully slow it took more than 10 minute to just get the bill.. 

Deco is a lot simpler than other locations without that young and hopping energetic vibe, which is OK.. But the view here is just so depressing looking at some dumpsters and dirty parking lot."}
{"text":"Spin is a decent cafe that serves savory and dessert crepes/waffles. I've been here a couple of times and everytime I come I would get a \"One Sweet Day\" waffle and substitute the ice cream for vanilla or white chocolate. Waffles here are decent but some flavours aren't as great.
It was obvious that the restaurant was short staffed as there were only two servers but the entire restaurant was full. My friend ordered a waffle originally but they said they ran out which was fine and when she changed her order they gave her the wrong order. Their excuse was that it was the kitchen staffs first day. All was fine after her waffle got switched. They were also very nice about us sitting there talking for a while even though our food was done. 
Overall, spin is a good place to go if you want to hang out with friends. I still prefer demetres over spin but spin has a slower wait time."}
{"text":"I would love to write a 5 star review because all the food on the menu looked phenomenal. However it is with great disappointment that I can not. 
We walked in. We were seated immediately. We looked at the menu. Choose what we wanted to eat. Closed our menus to signal that we were ready to order. And than sat there for 15 minutes. Watched our server walk back and forth. But no one came to take our drink or food order. So we got up and left. And went to the bar across the plaza where we got excellent food and service. 
I was extremely excited to try the desserts here. But I guess my cheesecake craving is destined to go unsatisfied. What a shame."}
{"text":"Fail!!!!!
Don't come here!!
Food sucks !!
Go to demetres down the street!
Not sure why they haven't listened to the reviews on Yelp! You need to change this menu and the chefs because the foods bland and awful! 
My boyfriend got the all day breakfast with a scrambled egg crepe and the egg was not even cooked all the way and the crepe wasn't even cooked! 
He also ordered chocolate chip pancakes and they chocolates were on the top sprinkled lightly and nothing on the inside.. they were basically 15$ plain pancakes !!! 
The only good thing we had was the white chocolate milkshake but it was so tiny !!"}
{"text":"Food was okay, however, the service was unfortunately awful.  Took a full 20 minutes just to receive a glass of water.  Our Peach Cobbler Latte (Feature Drink) was served with curdled milk.

The dining room was loud and the servers were unattentive.

I do not think I will be returning."}
{"text":"I've been to this location once, and that one time was enough to not have me as a returning customer. 

I went with a friend around 2-4 pm, I believe on a Saturday. It was incredibly dead. There must have been three tables, not including us. My friend ordered some chicken crepe or something and I ordered a slice of cheesecake. 

My friends food arrived, and I waited, and waited. Still no cake. The waiter (who I learned is the owner) did not even acknowledge the fact that I was still missing my order and was by the front door. About twenty minutes after my friends food arrived, he came over and I told him I hadn't recieved my cake. A quick apology was given, and my cake was delivered. 

I'd overlook a wait that long for food had the place been busy, but there was really no reason for a customer to be waiting THAT long. 

Wish I could have reviewed this better. If you're looking for slow service, then I'd definitely recommend this place to you."}
{"text":"4 stars for the food but have cut one for the customer service.. The staff needs to work on their attitude towards the customers.. The food was great.. Loved the waffles served with cappuccino ice cream, fresh cream and hot caramel sauce!!"}
{"text":"Went for cupcake and cheesecake and it was bad. Cupcake was worse than the ones sold in Walmart and VERY oily. Cheesecake was too small for the price. On that note - it's quite an expensive place. If I want desert again,  I will go to demerits next time. Way better for the price."}
{"text":"Horrible desserts, and service wasn't that great. My husband threw up after eating the \"I like it that way\" on a waffle. The bananas were not ripe and the chocolate sauce was chunky and the presentation was poor. He felt sick immediately after eating. The waiter had no knowledge of the food nor the ingredients. He brought a dessert and told us it had a nutella sauce but then said it was regular chocolate sauce after we reminded him that particular dessert was to have no nut products. We tried something new as an alternative to Demetres, however, we won't be coming back here again."}
