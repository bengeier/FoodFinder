{"text":"Pizza was so sloppy & the person whom answered the phone seemed annoyed that I was even calling. Probably will never go back."}
{"text":"LOVE there pizza!!!! They have the best crust and sauce around. We have ordered from them many times and we have always had good service.  We live 15 minutes away but it is worth the drive."}
{"text":"manager bought for lunch at work. did not enjoy. if i could post a one-word review it would be... \"barf\""}
{"text":"Had chicken on a recent visit. It was very good and ready at the said time. Good amount of jojo potatoes that were very good as well! Reasonably priced. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Good pizza I am not a huge fan of their pepperoni under the cheese so I usually order the green pepper and onion pizza it is delicious. I think their pizza sauce is a little sweeter than some places. So just a heads up on that. I think it is worth a try. The blackened chicken salad is so good and the Philly beef sub is awesome. I love their homemade ranch dressing as well. The homemade rolls are amazing and soft. I do love their chicken tenders and I dip them in their honey mustard which is like a golden honey mustard and quite delicious. The chicken tenders have a heavier breading on them but I love it. They are big pieces of chicken and you can't beat the price especially with their fresh fries."}
{"text":"We really like the food but we ordered tonight and two weeks ago- two weeks ago we were told 25 min pick up time, I arrived on time, some of our items had not even begun being cooked yet. I waited in my car for another fifteen minutes for it to be done- it was a weeknight at 9pm, they were not busy. Tonight we ordered and were told 30 min... again, arrived on time, they had not even put the pizza in the oven yet... not apologetic, waited an additional fifteen minutes in the car again--- very bad service which stinks because the food is usually pretty good- the service would get zero stars but two just because the product is still tasty, unfortunately probably wont be ordering from here for awhile (or unless we have an hour to wait)--- and tonight they forgot something in the order. Pretty disappointing- no service at all."}
{"text":"Very good service.  During my visit, the restaurant area seemed to be closed with only Carryout available. Pizza was ready when promised and very good. Good value."}
{"text":"First visit and won't be the last. Pizza was delicious, hot, and ready when promised. I love a thick chewy non-greasy crust and this sure didn't disappoint. Prices were very reasonable and customer service was pleasant."}
{"text":"Wanted to try a new place for pizza in the area and gave Leonardos a shot. Picked up a large pizza with sausage and banana peppers tonight. It cost me $10.95. The pizza was above average with lots of tasty cheese and sauce. Could've had a few more toppings but it was okay. I will give it another shot."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best pizza ever! They are always extremely quick. We've never had a wait longer than 20 minutes after calling in. We haven't tried anything else on the menu yet."}
{"text":"Great pizza and service. Left my wallet at home when i went to pick up my order. They said to call with card number and all was well. Nice people."}
{"text":"This is our go to place for carryout for the past 10 years.  Never a bad experience, always polite & courteous.  Good food and good people"}
{"text":"I usually get the blackened chicken sandwich with breaded French fries. Those two things are my favorite on the menu. Today I tried their chicken bacon rang pizza and I was pleasantly surprised with how good it was! Their regular pizza is good as well but if you want to try something a little different I would go with this! Always great service and it's usually done very fast. They are open on Sundays as well."}
{"text":"Yum!  Yet again Yelp did not let me down! We were visiting town on NYE and decided we wanted to stay in at the hotel and order pizza. They got us our food quickly and were friendly on the phone - and everything was delicious.   Nice not to thin not to thick crust, the sauce and toppings were great too!  I didn't get to try any of the sandwiches but those in our group that did enjoyed them as well.   If we're ever around again I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!  I honestly have never even tried their pizza because I can't get past ordering their Leo burgers and breaded french fries!! That's right I said breaded french fries as if deep-fried potatoes aren't bad enough now they Bread them! Oh yeah they are that good.   The little Leo burgers are like mini burgers almost like a slider but slightly bigger. If any of you remember the hamburger stations burgers that's kind of what they're like except 10 times better. Homemade rolls maybe I don't know but they are amazing eat them and you will agree.  I've also tried their salads which are awesome. I know I know I go from a greasy burger and fries to a salad but hey every once in a while we need to eat a little bit better right? Anyway they're supposedly creamy Italian salad dressing is what I get.    It's definitely not creamy Italian more like a ranch, but believe me it is the best ranch you've ever had your life. And they give you one of their roles that they make their absolute awesome.  On top of it all it's a small business with the owner there every single day, how could you not want to support somebody that actually works every day and doesn't just sit back and collect money?  Bottom line the place is good give it a try I'm sure you'll like it"}
{"text":"If you're looking for FANTASTIC pizza, look no further. It may not look like much from the outside, but the food is worth the money, wait, drive and anything else you can throw at it. The only down side is that the food is so good you won't want to eat here more than every once in a while for fear of losing that sense of satisfaction. Seriously, I cannot recommend this place highly enough. However, don't expect it to be at your door in thirty minutes or less - they don't deliver orders less than $50!"}
{"text":"This hole-in-the-wall looking place harbors the best pizza sauce on the planet combined with an excellent crust and top-shelf toppings.   No extraordinary toppings to talk about or other sauces just damn good eats! Carryout only."}
{"text":"I personally love the fact that it's five minutes from my house I've never had bad food from there couple years ago I had bad customer service but again the food was great we just catered my daughter's birthday party this Sunday from there I will update the review if it goes bad"}
{"text":"Service is great but the pizza wasn't the best I have ever had. Jo Jo's were amazing. Hot rice was good too."}
{"text":"Decent, better than average pizza. From what I can tell, this place is take out only. I placed an order with pizza, chicken and potatoes and it was ready within 15-20 minutes. I think their small pizza is a perfect size for 1-2 people, but their fried chicken was also really good along with the jojo style potatoes. I'm only giving this place four stars and not five because as far as pizza goes, nothing can measure up to Angelo's in Lakewood in my eyes, because their pizza is the bomb dot com- but this place is much closer to where I live, and will probably become my go to take out place from now on."}
