{"text":"I haven't been to Swiss Chalet in a while and was surprised by how the menu has changed! The 'usual' fare is near the back of the menu and some of the new items are Cheesy Bacon chicken Penne, Pesto chicken Penne, Chicken Parmesgan sandwich and perogies! I had the Pesto Penne and it had big chunks of chicken and it was delicious! my son had the cheesy bacon penne and really liked it! This particular restaurant was clean and not too busy. The service was fast and friendly. I was happy overall with our meals and will return again when I am in the Mississauga area!"}
{"text":"Just like the person who wrote the previous review, I have been to this particular location to dine in on a number of occasions without any issues. the servers have been prompt and polite. The food is exactly what you would expect from a Swiss Chalet. So this review is by no means a reflection upon the dine in experience. The delivery service from this location is HORRIBLE. I am reasonable enough to understand that there are occasional mix ups here and there but this is an ongoing issue with this location. I have had items missing on a number of occasions and most recently my order was completely incorrect. My advice: if you have the option order from another location completely. If not, verify the contents of the order before the driver leaves."}
{"text":"I don't really like the chicken but friends wanted to go to this restaurant, so I ordered a roast beef sandwich. It was a mash of beef scraps, not fit for my dog.  They have a really good food stylist, the picture looked delicious. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service, food is ok but you get treated like crap. Avoid this Swiss chalet as you will be dissapointed"}
{"text":"This was a pretty disappointing meal.  For the same price my wife and I were able to eat at (not from Mississauga so forgive me if I have it wrong) Muskoka jacks turtle burger place- where the food was absolutely fantastic.  Instead we had very watery beer, mediocre pirogues, horrendous spinach and cheese dip, and chicken pot pie with way too much Rosemary.   The atmosphere was completely impersonal, the staff were not friendly and yet the bill was still high.   Made us rethink Swiss chalet."}
{"text":"Always a great pick for a meal everyone most likely will agree on. Can always get a seat right away. The waitresses are always nice. My only question/concern, is since there renovation many years back, they have not been busy to the degree they were before. Makes me wonder why."}
{"text":"I have loved Swiss Chalet for as long as I can remember and often opt for it especially when out with grandparents. But, beware of this particular location. It was definitely one of the worst dinning experiences I have ever had at a restaurant. The meal (classic Swiss Chalet quarter chicken meal) was comforting and delicious, but the service was terrible. The waitress was rude and inattentive. Every interaction was unpleasant from trying to ask for a refill to pointing out a mistake made on the bill. I called the next day and spoke to manger about the experience. The manger displayed a couldn't-care-less attitude and basically told me off for not telling a manger while the experience was happening. I explained I didn't ask to speak with a manger during the visit as we were with our grandparents trying to enjoy ourselves- The manger still didn't seem to care."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Food was cold. Long time between serving the first and last person at the table."}
{"text":"Our 2 meals arrived 30 minutes early which was great however the fries were not fully cooked and the chicken was slightly dry."}
{"text":"Tasteless and dry chicken. Waitress seemed like she didn't care and barely came to my table after I commented about the food. I won't be going back to this place. Food and service sucked."}
{"text":"I would of maybe gave 2 stars if i didn't need to cook my meal when it got to my place. Fries were raw, wings tasted awful and ceasar salad was just lettuce in a plastic dish. Called them to get it replaced which they were happy to do but when the replacement got here it was the same thing."}
{"text":"Delivery was super fast. Chicken tasty and tender, greek salad and soup good . Was only disappointed in the fries they didnt seem fresh and werent crispy enough for me. Would order delivery again if emergency, healthier than pizza."}
{"text":"I love this Canadian tradition of swiss chalet but some restaurants are better than others.  This is one of the better ones. The chicken is juicy and not overcooked, the fries are not salty and the sauce was just delicious. I truly enjoyed the food here. The service is good and I will definitely come back to this location to have my fill of my fave chicken rotisserie place."}
{"text":"Swiss chalet... What can I say? If you like it, you love it! A Canadian staple food (at least at my house) This location always has good quality food, quick service and the waitresses are very friendly :) They recently renovated this location and it looks new and trendy, but personally, I liked it better before."}
{"text":"Disgusting!  Arrived at 11:40 am, barely anyone was there.  I got seated right away but decided to move my table. So I asked a waitress and she gave me attitude.  Her response was basically, \" I don't care\". I was appalled.  I got to my table and i had to wait for ten freaking minutes for my menu. Barely anyone was there?! The waitress finallllly came to my table and gave me the menu and guess who was my server, The one who gave me attitude. Her attitude right away changed when she came. Probably because I was with people. We placed our order and I asked her for the desert menu. I specifically told her that I wanted my desert along with my meal. She laughed and said okay. I kept an eye on her and no show up for my desert menu. I saw a black, bald server and I said, \"excuse me\", and her response was with her back turned towards me with her back hand in my face. What the ef ?! My family and I were shocked! I have neeevvvvverrr been so disrespected in my life!!! Our food finally came and I told our freaking waitress that I asked for the desert menu. She looked at me with a disgusting look on her face and said, \" okay?\". Lmaaaooo!!! What the he'll! So I asked to speak with her manager and told her everything that had happened. I asked what kind of people is she hiring? The manager told me that they worked there for a long time? Lmao wow. I didn't eat or even touched the water I was so disgusted! Tall, white older lady and black, bald older lady. How disgusting to treat their customers with such disrespect! Being younger, way younger than them, I have more respect and manor than they'll ever have. Age ain't nothing but a number. Respect your elders my ass. Respect those who respect others. Wow! 0\10. I've never wrote a review but this I had too.  I asked my mother and grandmother if they enjoyed their meal and they said it wasn't that great. our service was so Disgusting that they couldn't enjoy it. Especially that I didn't eat either. Never will I go there ever in my life. I got no apology from either of the low servers. Thanks for nothing. 0/10."}
{"text":"I've been eating at various Swiss Chalet locations across town over the past 20 years and this location for almost a decade since it's in my neighbourhood.  I like Swiss Chalet chicken and I usually get a half chicken dinner with salad and fries (I've tried their pot pie which is a bit heavy and rib combos too).  I eat there 3-4 times a year so I'm not a regular... it's only when I'm in the mood and usually with a buddy who likes their chicken.    The service is mixed too as I've had both bad and good service so that is why I always request the same server (she's been there for the past 6-7 years) and she is consistently good.  Occasionally, I've gotten a smaller chicken but not that often and the quality is pretty consistent but nothing to rave about.  Once a while, I've had an apple pie and it's not bad but again nothing spectacular.   Look for their seasonal specials where they offer a holiday meal that is fair value.  If I have any complaint, it's their prices that have been climbing and dropping it's value.  I can pick up a equally tasty WHOLE chicken from a nearby Longos for $10 (less than $8 tax in on Wednesdays) and I'm chomping on it for 2 meals where as it costs me $18 for a half chicken dinner with sides, drink (refillable), tax and tip dining in here.  Prior to the renovation (2010), the restaurant was very old, tired looking and not very inviting but better now  This is a franchise operation so you will get different service from each outlet but overall, I'd say this place is above average (3.5 stars not quite 4) but only cos I know my server will be good."}
{"text":"We went here with a table of 12 people for my daughter's birthday dinner.  We had made reservations so the tables were already nicely set up for us.  Arrived at 5 pm, and the restaurant got super busy right after we got there!  Our waitress was good, considering the size of our party, and how busy the place was.    I ordered the chicken (breast) with rice/shrimp.  The chicken was nicely done, and I love to dip it in their signature sauce.  The shrimp were nice and juicy, but the rice had too much butter on it.  I think next time I will stick with the salad on the side.  We ordered a full cake which we all shared, and the staff all came out with it singing happy birthday to my daughter which totally made her day!    After our meal, the manager came over and thanked us and helped clear our table.  Overall, their prices were good, and it wasn't too loud or overcrowded.  I think we would go back here again for a nice family meal, especially for a nice Sunday dinner."}
{"text":"Just like any other person I would need an annual dose of Swiss Chalet but since there's one in the neighborhood it would be sooooo much more convenient... alas it isn't so. First visit was in December, it was newly opened and not really organized. The portions were definitely zapped by a shrink ray! The service was non existent. Actually complained to the manager and received a voucher. I felt bad but what could I do?? I left still hungry and bad service?? Come on now! Second visit was to use the voucher and to my dismay same stuff..Unfortunately I will no longer be returning..there are greater experiences to be had out there!"}
{"text":"Of all Swiss Chalet locations, this one is pretty decent. Their food is hot and quick. The fries aren't burnt or soaked in grease. Nice staff as well!"}
{"text":"Came here at 2:30, and so far we have waited 45 minutes for our food to arrive.  We had to go find the waitress to see why it was taking so long. We had ordered 1 rib, 1 quarter chicken, 1 pot pie, and 1 flatbread.  They offered us free dessert for our wait, but later told us we could only get two and our choices were limited to certain items, so we ordered a regular cheesecake and brownie sundae.  We ordered at 2:30 and the time is now 4:00. We're still waiting for dessert.  Please note that this was on Thanksgiving day, and the restaurant was understaffed.  The restaurant was not even half full, although on the other side, there was a large group of 20.  The waitress did the best she could under the circumstances, but clearly the management failed big time by not having enough staff on hand."}
{"text":"I don't expect much from these places but this was just terrible. Venue was filthy. There was food caked to the wall adjacent to our table. Two glasses had floating food in them.Server was unaware of basic service skills. They took 10 minutes to greet us and another 10 to collect payment. They even forgot the lemon wash at the end, a signature of this brand. The chicken was their only saving grace. I think take out and delivery is their focus and not the guest experience. Just poorly executed."}
{"text":"Food was not good. Packaged and heated and obviously so. The waitress was nice enough but it didn't make up for the food shortcomings. Not a restaurant I would recommend, or revisit."}
{"text":"Abby is the best waitress... Excellent service.. fast efficient... and very friendly.. She really loves her job it shows... I always sit in her section... Thank you so much Abby you are the best  Michelle & Brent"}
{"text":"We had garlic cheesy loaf - soft, fresh, buttery delicious Quarter chicken dinner - fries were not crispy for some reason, which was a big disappointment because we have one Swiss Chalet in Vancouver, and they consistently have really awesome fries.  So I was looking forward to the fries here, oh well. Chicken is good quality, but we strongly disliked the Chalet sauce, which tasted like watered down gooey salad dressing with a bad aftertaste.  It's a shame because they obviously count on you to dip the chicken in the Chalet sauce since the chicken is not really flavoured, so if you don't like the sauce, you end up eating with pretty bland chicken.  I wish there were other sauces available other than the Chalet sauce.  I see a lot of complaints about service here.  Our waiter was pleasant, but we could see he was forcing himself to smile.  Good effort, and good enough for us."}
{"text":"Great place to relax with a drink and good food. Staff very friendly. we go there often"}
{"text":"Got delivery and had to wait 30 minutes above the delivery time even after calling to check on my order. Needless to say fries were soggy, sauce and chicken were cold and soup was room temperature. Had no cutlery or condiments even though is ask for some. Was close to giving only one star but portions were good a size."}
{"text":"Awful customer service. Takes a long time for food to arrive. Server was rude and seemed like she hates her job. When my husband asked her one question about the food she replied with an annoyed tone and wanted to rush us. Never coming to this location again."}
{"text":"This is a great location for getting swiss chalet chicken if you are in Oakville and use the Go Train often.   The restaurant is located right across the street from the go station and has a drive through which is very convenient."}
{"text":"Out with old school love again. Food is not hot. Came out fast.  Would not come back to this location."}
{"text":"I was in there a week ago for lunch. Really bad service.! they were not busy at all. I wasn't even finished my salad yet when the server brought our food out to us. she pushed my salad bowl off right into my hand so she could put the plate down. so I had the salad bowl in my hand and eating the salad. I'm not impressed. Than she asked if we wanted the rest of the food to go and instead of her taking the plates and put the food in the containers, she brought the containers to us for us to do it our selfs. and the fries were mushy. I have never had such bad service like that."}
{"text":"When I'm in the mood for comfort food, this place still hits the spot. I'm constantly travelling so when I come home, I find myself craving their chicken and fries. I've never had an issue with my order here and I've always gotten good service. Still the best chicken around since I was a kid!"}
{"text":"So I was very excited for the new crispy chicken. Being from the US, it reminded me of KFC. The side in the picture looked amazing. Now the problem o have is that the chicken looked NOTHING like it does on the commercial. Though it is tasty, it was kind of a let down. As for the side, if this was for a family of four or more, it would actually only serve two..Sorry to say but for my first time ever having this, I probably won't try it again."}
{"text":"Worse service ever!!! Wait staff walk around like they're on holidays in the Caribbean with no care in the world. Leave you waiting when you walk in even when it's dead and by the way it's probably always dead. Won't go back for lunch. Hardly no customers and it took over an hour. When they first opened, it was better cause the Asian manager kept things in order but now it's like you're at the server's mercy. And they have no mercy! Only pick up take out now!Too bad."}
{"text":"Eine genervte Serviererin wies mir einen recht schmutzigen Tisch zu. Die nächste kollegin war sehr freundlich. Bestellung: 1/3 Ribs mit Salat und einem Canadian. Ribs für meinen Geschmack zu fettig und teilweise knorpelig. Soße recht langweilig im Geschmack. Der salat frisch und das Hausdressing lecker. Insgesamt ok und fur einen airport akzepzable Preise."}
{"text":"Extremely rude server today  as she put our food down  she literally said \"can you pay me now\"  I was shocked I just stared at her  and she just stared back !!!  Then she says \"I want to go home so can you pay me now\" now I'm not new to restaurants  so I understand that sometimes servers need you to cash out  but the way she did it  was so rude   I hate spending my money and getting treated like crqp"}
{"text":"How does Swiss Chalet run out of chickens on a Saturday evening?? Never have I seen so many staff doing so little and confusing each other.  Hmmm maybe I just answered my question!"}
{"text":"Well this was an OK experience. The service was fast and the food was good. However I think the chicken pieces are shrinking. My skimpy chicken leg was tiny and the bread roll even smaller. Also we did not receive any water and lemon for cleaning our hands and had to use the washroom to clean our greasy fingers.  Otherwise clean restaurant."}
{"text":"This past weekend I kept hearing radio advertisemnents about the 25th anniversary of the festive special ... and what can i say radio advertisements work (so does gravy cravings due to lack of swiss in Montreal).      All three of us ordered chicken and rib festive meals but were very surprised both at how long it took for food to arrive and at how different each of our plates looked when they arrived - considering they were the same meal.    My ribs were blackened with charcoal with a flattened appearance, while another friend's ribs looked normal but had the tiniest little piece of chicken we'd recalled seeing at Swiss Chalet before.   We were so distracted by the odd appearance of our meals not to mention the small portion of fries that we failed to notice that we were given no utencils to eat with.   We flagged down the first waitor we saw and asked for utensils but none came - we actually had to wait while our food was getting cold for our waiter to return and ask her for utensils.   It was a bizarre experience.   Needless to say we didn't starve and picked at the fries and bread with our fingers.   Swiss Chalet is definitely not regarded as a fine dining experience but I recall them running a tighter ship than we were experiencing.     Our initial impressions of the meal were correct - it was definitely the worst tasting Swiss Chalet we had experienced in years.   My whole grain bun dipped in chalet sauce was the highlight of the meal as even our fries were over cooked.    Not much more to say except that I definitely won't be going back anytime soon.   The free Lindor chocolates we received carried this up to 2 stars but it was very close to being my first 1 star review."}
{"text":"Really want to compliment how much I appreciate this location, not only is it close to where I live, but most importantly, I think the management at this restaurant is done pretty well.  It really takes care of the experience of customers.   I personally really like the homey atmosphere of Swiss Chalet restaurants, this location of course has that... on top of when there are special days, this location does a bit of extra to make the customer experience even better.  For example, I remember last year on Mother's Day, they make sure to give a stem of rose to the mother at the table after their meal.  That is a nice touch to end the meal off in my opinion.  Also, recently I went and they decorated their main lobby with lots of beautiful Christmas decorations.  I would not be surprised if it was just a tree and a few things hanging, but they did more than that and it makes me feel so warm and happy walking into such a festive lobby.  The servers at the restaurant are also very nice and polite.  And when there was the $14.99 promotion for 2 quarter-leg dinners, I've been to another Swiss Chalet location where they prohibited me from ordering dark meat (not because they ran out of it, but they simply did not allow to order dark meat) whereas this location did not have such restrictions.  I really hope the manager of the restaurant would see this review and know that someone really appreciates the management here.  Please keep it up!"}
{"text":"My ordinary experience with Swiss Chalet is positive - both chicken and ribs. But I ordered a 1/2 rack of ribs from this location and it was not edible. Cold by the time the time the order arrived, but that was nothing compared to the complete and obvious level of lack of interest they showed in the food. So undercooked and tough I could barely get the ribs apart with a cleaver. One star for the coleslaw.   DO NOT ACCEPT DELIVERY FROM HERE."}
{"text":"I got a chicken wrap from here yesterday afternoon a nd was violently sick the entire night. Defiantly food poisoning. Please be ware when eating take out from this place."}
{"text":"The fictitiously 'delicious' chicken came burned and dry.  Crispy and yet cold, both the chicken and the service we received, although service came with a soupcon of negligence.  Nice interior but service can leave you feeling rushed, almost as if the waitresses only care about turning tables.  Great fries, but after 20 minutes without being spoken to, it can make one long for human contact once again.  The heart of bloor west village must be beating rapidly, trying to rid itself of a hot bed of neglect and mediocre fare.  Be careful, your server may spill on you - which happened to us. The finger cleaning bowls came mid-meal, leaving us to wash up in cold water.  It can leave one wondering: \"how do they let food out of the kitchen looking like this?\".  Rushed, Boring Food, Exceptionally poor service.  2/5 - and those 2 points are for the sauce alone."}
{"text":"This place gives you that warm winter comfort food feeling. The waitresses there are very sweet and will be there to help you when you need them. Their fries are delicious, but I'm still not sure if I'm a fan of their chicken. I order the white meat, and it's fresh and juicy, yet a little dry. Their mashed potatoes don't seem very fresh, so stick to the fries.  They have their special secret sauce, so be sure to try that! Overall, it's a nice place to go to once in a while, especially in winter."}
{"text":"Got a whole chicken and fries delivered. When it came it was cold and the meat and fried were flaccid. It tasted like it had been in a car for a number of hours."}
{"text":"Server was really nice pleasant, informative and helpful. Food tastes good the chicken Parmesan could have had a little more cheese in it but otherwise it was cooked well and tasty.  The food did take a while to come out (roughly 20 minutes)  I would return as the server was good and food was tasty."}
{"text":"This has to be, hands down, the worst meal I have ever been served anywhere, in a restaurant or home.  The chicken was dry and tiny, the roll was rock hard, the corn was a chewy mess.  I won't even endeavor to describe what I think was supposed to be coleslaw.  The restaurant itself was filthy to boot!  You could not pay me to eat there again.  The upshot to this review was that the wait staff were terrific.  We were lost and they went out of their way to assist us, which is why we didn't walk out as soon as they set this horrible excuse for rotisserie chicken down."}
{"text":"Something is going wrong with this location. We often were going there with family and were enjoying their meals, but I find with time the quality started to slip. Last time we went there the server was totally not interested in what she was doing. She missed few things in our order, the food was OK, but they brought main course before we finished appetizers, which made us think they want us to eat fast and get away. (And this is when the restaurant was half-empty). I am more and more considering something else that Swiss Chalet for simple and good food now."}
{"text":"There is a For Lease sign in the window and all the signage is gone, so I don't see that this is temporarily closed.  There are four other locations downtown, but this one was down the street and delivery was very fast.  Sad face."}
{"text":"It's pretty good most the time but, the odd time I find the chicken a little under cooked. With lots of veins it grosses me out and the frys are burnt and mushy! For the most part there pretty good try not to catch them an hour before close is what I've noticed!"}
{"text":"This is my second time visiting Swiss Chalet with the first visit being at their Memorial Dr location and comparing the two, the Shawnessy location looked way better and more suited in the modern time family restaurant.  Swiss Chalet offers a variety of Canadian style dishes including a couple of healthy dishes.   Today's visit was an \"okay\" satisfaction since my family and I went at around 2-2:30 after the lunch period was over. Usually from 2-5 any restaurant are way under staff since there's typically little to none customers who comes at that time which gives the restaurant staff time to prep for the dinner period.  I ordered the Sweet Thai Chilli salad while my mom and brother got the \"2 can dine for $14.99\" meal which consist of quarter chicken, dinner roll, gravy and a side of fries - which in this case was subbed for Cesar salad. Each dish was flavourful and presented well  Overall satisfaction was achieved but the only tip I would recommend is not to go between 2-5pm even if it is not busy you'll be waiting for a while"}
{"text":"This restaurant was DISGUSTING.  I ordered a large chicken, 4 fries and 2 gravies. The fries were stale, old and disgusting. The chicken was RAW. Honestly, we have pictures of how pink the meat was. The food tasted disgusting. I will NEVER come back here, and as soon as I can figure out how to post pictures of that raw meat in the chicken, I will. Do not go here, at all!"}
{"text":"Worse customer service I ever had. First it took over 5 minutes to be seated. Then when I asked for a booth, the waiter was lazy about wanting to clean the table so we ended up taking a half booth table. Took over 15 minutes for someone to come over to our table and asked if we wanted anything."}
{"text":"Don't go here. Poor customer service. Waiter/servers are rude and will totally ignore you. I only go here because this is the closest to where I live but they never fail to disappoint me.  They are only fast when they give you the bill."}
{"text":"I like the fact that the Swiss Chalet has drive thru, it's a chain so there is not much to talk about flavour and taste.  I do not really like this location but I come here as necessary. Today one piece of chicken was tender and the other dry to the point it was inedible. That is the story of the place nothing great."}
{"text":"Never a disappointment, our meals always come out pipping hot and the staff are amazing. Love your new crispy chicken - keep it on the menu!!!"}
{"text":"I've always loved swiss chalet and being that I'm always disappointed with the take out swiss chalet when my family gets it. Today was different though, we had a family meal at this swiss chalet and it was a very tasty meal. Eatung in restaurant gives you nice crispy-ish skin that I've grown to miss on the takeout chicken, and the fries when you eat in are to die for. Some say they're not that good, but when you get fresh swiss chalet fries you'll be hard pressed to find me complaining; they're cinsistent and if you regularly go to swiss chalet you know what you're getting. Consistent decent food for a decent price. The one this I have difficulty with is i never get dessert there, never get appetisers, I only go for chicken and fries with sauce. The only way they can win me over more as a customer is if they include some vegetables with the dinners... potatos aren't veggies in my book"}
{"text":"My family and I went for dinner. It was a horrible experience. The staff was all worn out and unfriendly. We have to send our food back twice. Once it was wrong and second time it was too cold. Also the onions were missing from our burgers and when asked they gave us the onions that looks like dog's crap. I would suggest all to stay away from this place."}
{"text":"Swiss Chalet stands strong as my personal comfort food provider!  Having grown up in Canada, the taste of that chalet sauce just brings me back to my childhood.  It's delicious and affordable, can't really go wrong there!  Plus, it's everywhere so there's always a Swiss Chalet near you. Their rice pilaf is my favorite side.  - Kristine"}
{"text":"I give this Swiss chalet a 1 only because there are no negatives available. We ordered from here a couple times and i have now learned my lesson. The final straw came when it took 35 minutes on the phone just to order, then when the order finally came after another hour it was cold, the chicken was dried out and it was missing the drinks buns condiments and utensils. To add to all that the driver didn't know we had paid on visa over the phone and had no record of the sale and spent time on the phone trying to find out if we had actually paid. When I called to inform them about the missing items and the food itself, they offered to bring the missing items out free of charge. Free of charge? Were they going to charge me again for the items they missed? Anyway after another 40 minutes the drinks and everything else showed up but we were done our cold dried out meals already. Never again."}
{"text":"Ok so everybody knows Swiss.. The chicken is a 4 star.. I love the sauce I like the chicken. The reason I gave them a 3 star is the overall menu. I tried the much hyped roast beef and it was terrible like horrible.. Please do us a favour and stick to the chicken. Juicy and so good with the sauce. The beef was dry and funky. I just figured with that much hype it might have been worth trying.   Update : I don't understand who manages this place but this is the last time I go wtf is this. Pay extra for a Caesar salad and you get this"}
{"text":"Ordered take out for the family. Quarter chicken weren't not cooked properly and had blood in them. Pies were cut so small. Told the Manager his response was \"it is what it is.\" What a jerk but I told the customer service number and they fixed the order. Still what a terrible manager."}
{"text":"I generally love Swiss Chalet! The chicken, ribs and gravy are an quick and easy dinner solution. The service at this location was not very good. I ordered a half chicken dinner and the chicken was very, very dry. It was like they had kept it on a car engine or somewhere else that was warm  and uninviting overnight somewhere so that it could be served the next day. The experience has me turned off from eating any Swiss Chalet for a long while. In hindsight, I think I would have been better off getting breast meat and warm sides from the supermarket across the street."}
{"text":"Me and my family had a tasty meal. The food was tasty and the portions where decent. I had the chipotle chicken linguine it was so good and the chicken tastes as good as a home made one.. Definitely will come here again"}
{"text":"Everything was good untill my husband was in the middle of his meal and he found piece of receipt (yes, piece of paper left from smbd), slightly grilled. Why not?:/"}
{"text":"Our server messed up the order, forgetting a key addition to one of the meals. He then took about 10 minutes to bring a drink refill.   The servers openly argued with one another within full view and earshot of the customers. They were arguing about placing customers within the appropriate section. This was slightly embarrassing to witness this lack of professionalism from the staff.   We waited a good 15 minutes for our bill when we were anxious to leave. The waiter had clearly disappeared out the door on a break.  When the bill finally arrived, our server made a mistake on the bill to top it all off.   The food was decent, however. The service will deter us from ever going back."}
{"text":"Dine in review: one of my favourite Swiss Chalets. Every time I visit, I always receive really good service and attentive servers. Food is prompt, great, ambience is cozy. Location is very convenient."}
{"text":"there veggies are very clearly frozen.   but there fries are good  and OK dipping sauce."}
{"text":"Don't ever go there on New Years Day. Slow service, short staffing, mixed up orders, cold food and a cold restaurant are all great ways to loose business. Add a drunk who takes a swing at a server and the manager doesn't do anything and well you get the picture. Not a good place to eat at all."}
{"text":"I absolutely despise this location whether it is drive through, pick up or delivery. My order is never right, they are super slow and they don't care when they screw up. Out of the three ways to get food here, I think sitting and eating is the best option, however the amount of children screaming and crying inside makes me cringe.   The drive through and delivery is always aggravating. My order has NEVER been right when I order swiss chalet. When I order Harvey's in the drive thru I have no issues (both drive thrus are the same place). Since they are already taking 10-15 minutes to get me my order for the drive thru window, why not take an extra minute or two to make sure it's right..it's not that hard esp if I'm the only person in the drive thru. I always have to double check my order, park and than go inside to get it fixed where I have to wait in line again.   I REALLY HATE THIS LOCATION!"}
{"text":"Explain to me how an order I place online gives me a total of 34$ (email receipt from your site) but when you get to my door it is 38$? (In store printed receipt)? The 1/4 chicken should have been 11.79$ as stated online and not 15.77$ when you get to my door. To top it off the food quality is sub par. I also called right after I placed my order to add a fudge cake....forgot to deliver that with my order"}
{"text":"Yass! Duke! This place is amazing. I've always loved the way Swiss Chalet does their food. The special sauce, the ribs, and their famous rotissarie chicken! Absolutely love it here. Also, its pretty healthy to eat. No complaints whatsoever."}
{"text":"***PLEASE NOTE This review is NOT for a specific location of Swiss Chalet***  I called Swiss Chalet to order food for my parents who are senior citizens- during the Toronto ice storm, which is still going on at he moment.   My parents who live about an hour away from me, had not had warm food for 3 days. They were surviving on bread, cheese and biscuits.  I called Swiss Chalet twice to place an order, every time they would ask me the address for the food delivery, they would hang up on me.  I think that was very rude of Swiss Chalet and if they could not deliver to a certain area, they could have at least told me that instead of hanging up!!  That's all I have to say."}
{"text":"Food was good and the service was excellent. Waitress was very  polite and attentive. I had the quarter chicken dinner with white meat and it was exactly as expected. The fries are amazing. I would definitely go back. 3 people with drinks , and was only 60 dollars."}
{"text":"Great service, amazing food and we'll priced for urban dining. Can not go wrong with anything on the menu. Don't neglect the appetizers and desserts. We had a great night out went to some bars afterwards, this was a great way to start the night out."}
{"text":"I am disappointed. I visited this restaurant around 7pm and I still waited 30 minutes for the food. The 1/4 chicken was too small, it was closer to 1/6 chicken. Their fries are disgusting, very greasy and not tasty. The only food I liked was pecan pie.   I was leaving hungry."}
{"text":"Dry chicken  Gross fries Meh and Blah  This location was the best one I've been to up until 2012 and has been going downhill since. Unless it's just the franchise but id rather by a whole rotisserie chicken at Costco and heat up frozen fries than return here."}
{"text":"Somewhere between now and the 80s when I first recall going to Swiss Chalet, they changed. Maybe it's for the better, maybe not. They still have great chicken, but I miss the old swiss-style costumes they made the girls wear. It kind of classed the place up a bit and made it feel like you were eating in a place with character. Now it's just the old in-and-out, as they say, and you hardly have time to savour the atmosphere. Which is severely lacking, these days. Now the servers wear Harvey's style outfits and get you seated, fed and on your way as quick as possible. But they haven't changed the chicken. This is the best move they've made over the years and the only reason they're still in business. It's fantastic chicken, though I've never gotten into their sauce. I know a lot of people like it, but I much prefer their lemon soup........... Anyway, you can at least count on them for exceptional food: their fries are still some of the best around and I've never had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"I don't usually go to Swiss Chalet but when I do, I expect amazing chicken and ribs as well as a very warming environment. I can say that the last time that I went was nothing like that.   We first walked in and was brought to a small table for 2, which was fine, and we were given menus. We probably sat for 15 minutes waiting for someone to take our order. A big group has just left beside us and the servers were busy cleaning the tables and not really paying attention to us. We FINALLY ordered some food and a beer. One of the servers tripped with the bottle of beer on her tray, causing the bottle to smash on the ground and spill beer everywhere. There were shards everywhere and it almost hit some of the customers who were sitting nearby. I understand that those kind of things happen at times.  The food probably took 30 minutes to come to our table which aggravated my dad a lot. We had to find a server to ask where our food was 2 times. (We would've asked more but there seemed to be a lack of servers in our section, we saw a server maybe once every 15-20 minutes) I ordered the half rack of ribs with mashed potatoes and boy was I disappointed. The mashed potatoes were cold and the rack of ribs were dry."}
{"text":"Terrible service! Ordered a meal for delivery from this Keele St location. It took 1 hour and 20 min to arrive. I called several times and was advised only after the 2nd call that there was an accident right in front of the restaurant preventing their drivers from getting to my house. This location is in a stripmall packing lot with numerous exits/entries. Apparently no one thought to use an alternate exit! When the food finally arrived it was missing part of my order and the chicken was obivously not warm. When I called back to complain, Jinell, the manager advised me she would offer me a $10 credit for the missing food, but would not credit my entire order as I requested. She said her regional manager would have to approve this and that she would call me in the morning. Surprise, no phone call. I do not recommend this location! Eat elsewhere. Very poorly run. Another incident a few years back while my family was eating in at the restaurant and I was told after about a 30min wait that they had \"run out of chicken\"! what?? So we were asked to wait another hour while they roasted more chicken. It wasn't even busy!!"}
{"text":"By far the worst restaurant my wife and I have ever been to, shamefully, multiple times because it is close to our home. Every time we have ordered pickup or delivery, there has been at least one huge, glaring error, always ripping us off. Tonight I was given a sandwich without lettuce, tomato, bacon, or ANY DRESSING OF ANY KIND. I got a piece of chicken between a bun instead of a chicken club. We will never be ordering or visiting this establishment again and would never recommend. Ever."}
{"text":"Horrible management of a restaurant! One young waitress serving half a restaurant with the seater having to leave lines of people waiting while she helped. Poor girl was literally running from table to table to kitchen, but it was impossible to keep up with all the complaints of waiting undue lengths of time for menus and water and food, and of being charged for items that should have been included with the meal. Five stars to that waitress who had a smile on her face and apologized profusely for the delays. But it was not her fault, management gave her no help. They probably pay her only minimum wage, and so even though we were disappointed with our experience we all generously tipped this girl. BECAUSE SHE DESERVED IT!!! However, I will never, never return to this location or recommend it. For shame treating your staff like chattel to line your pockets because you are too cheap to hire adequate help. Absolutely disgusting!!!"}
{"text":"The foods alright, they always be messing up the order by forgetting certain things not to sure if I'll be ordering there again."}
{"text":"While I do agree that this Swiss Chalet is not busy, no matter what time you come. I like to come here often, as it is close to my house. I love their ribs! Mmmmmm! (They are really good). I love their sauce, it is so good. Everything I have tried is good here. The waiters are fairly nice. Overall, I do like this restaurant, it is nice. It can get a bit too quiet sometimes and it can get a bit awkward but the vibe is good most of the time!"}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of SC. This site is very friendly and accomodating. The food is yummy and they are really kid friendly."}
{"text":"Terrible service at this swiss chalet the chicken was dry and it took an half hour to get our food. There were only 2 other customers in  besides us . Also you could here  the kitchen staff arguing or harrassing the female waitress. I will not be going back to this location."}
{"text":"The lay out is very nice but the food was meh, they put our garlic bread in a bag so by the time we got home it was sauggy.  They were also very cheap with the katchup they gave me 4 with our family meal I asked for more so they gave me 1."}
{"text":"At this particular Swiss Chalet location, the food is consistently good and tasty, and the service is EXCELLENT.  The staff is very pleasant and accommodating, and they really do make an extra effort to make you feel welcome. After eating here for years, my usual server Halina has become like family. I am one of the many \"regulars\" that frequent this location, and people have nothing but good things to say about her and the other staff. The owner is 'hands on' and really makes sure that any dining experience is wonderful.  Never a problem to find parking.  As for the food, the price is quite reasonable and the menu selection has improved tremendously in the last year or two.  I have eaten at different locations, but this one always seems to have the best food, as far as being well prepared, hot and fresh."}
{"text":"Seriously, it's Swiss Chalet.  Nothing about it has changed since we were kids, except I think the price has gone up and now they offer ribs."}
{"text":"We got burgers for delivery. It freshly cooked and delivered quickly, but the burger meat was really unpleasant. Clearly frozen, almost twice too big for the bug (why have an oblong burger for a round bun), and thick and dense. Note to self: Stick to chicken from Swiss Chalet.  Even if the burger meat was good, there's no customization. It's possible to pick off the pickle, but it's not possible to scrape off all the mayo, since it's soaked into the bun, and they put so much on that it oozes out onto the other things in the container."}
{"text":"The food was good and brought to the table in a reasonable time. Unfortunately our food was contaminated with ingredients that weren't listed for that particular dish and my girlfriend had a really bad allergic reaction. This really spoiled our evening. I guess we should have specified this, but usually just having fries is a safe option."}
{"text":"Poor menu choice. Dull interior. Poor lighting. Waitress wasn't very good.  Nothing special."}
{"text":"I was in the area and needed a quick take-away meal before my famished state led me  to chomp on my own hand. The only other options on the street were: Mr. Sub, Subway, and Quiznos. I wasn't in the mood for a sandwich. I settled on Swiss Chalet.  Quarter chicken with baked potato ($9 post-tax). I ate it because I was so hungry but ugh -- I feel really gross and dirty now. Like I've suffered post-clucker molestation syndrome.   I think I'll have a sandwich next time."}
{"text":"My experience with this particular Swiss Chalet location was nothing short of atrocious. Went to grab 2 whole chickens for take out. Granted they were a little busy I was told it will be a 10 to 15 min wait which I accepted. After the first 25 min I asked the young lady how much longer it was going to be  as I had guests over.  I was assured it was coming right up. We'll, my order came 20 minutes after that. In total it was a 45 minute wait for something I was told 15 minutes. However, when I got the 2 chickens the problem was that it was extremely dry and tasted like it had been really heated a few times.   To sum up my experience, I will never be going back to this particular location again."}
{"text":"Terrible value. Even with the coupons, the value for money is terrible. The chicken is so tiny that you would think it was a pigeon. My son remarked that the packaging for our take out was over sized compared to the contents. Swiss chalet not what they used to be."}
{"text":"Had the quarter chicken dinner and it was tasteless. The chicken was very dry the fries were undercooked and the gravy ain't like what it used to be and then to make it worse service was horrible their attitude really sucks like they don't even care about the job. I like to give waitress tips especially if there doing a good job but this time barely have nothing. Can't stand there attitude and laziness. Don't work there if you don't wanna be there. Won't be going back especially to this location ever again. Swiss Chalet used to be so much better. What happened!?!?"}
{"text":"We arrived early for our flight in order to avoid any traffic, but once our luggage was checked in we were pretty hungry. There are not many options at 7AM in Terminal 3 of YYZ, and being lactose intolerent I tend to avoid pastries as they may have milk and/or butter.  We settled down for Swiss Chalet, I kind of knew what to expectand this is exactly what we had. The service was swift, friendly and efficient, but still I think that a breakfast meny with less than ten options is sort-of lacking. Just offering the option of having eggs without any meat would be simple and would have been a great option for me. Also, all three omelets had either cheese or meat, so they were a no-go for me.  Nevertheless, my eggs over-easy were very well cooked, the yolk was so nice and runny I got some all over my Lululemon scarf, but that's another story! The boy thought it was kind of bland, but he ordered his eggs scrambled, which tend to get rubbery. I disagree with him on the potatoes though, I am a sucker for greasy hash browns, and they were right up my alley.  Overall, Swiss Chalet was a good option for grabbing a quick bite in or out the airport, I just wish they thought about people with \"complicated\" diets like mine, but you rarely can expect so much from a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"The Swiss Chalet offers mainly chicken dishes and is not my favorite place to go. However, I always find myself giving them another chance and regretting it afterwards.  This location is big inside and it's rather comfortable and homely. The place was pretty busy on the Sunday evening I was there. The waitresses are super nice and efficient and the food comes rather quick.  I tried the chicken wrap, poutine and a couple of desserts. The chicken wrap was okay, just cold. The poutine lacked cheese curds and some of the fries were cold too. The side of coleslaw was nice and creamy but I found a hair in it. Also, the ice cream sundae was boring and the cheesecake was almost frozen- I practically had to stab the cake to break a piece off. I gave up after that piece landed on the floor.  Overall, the Swiss Chalet has some nice chicken meal options for reasonable prices and the service was excellent at this location. However, every dish had a problem and I won't be back here again."}
{"text":"I've come here for take-out on several occasions. The take-out line can be crazy during afternoon and evening hours. Orders are taken quickly and food is handed over to you within few minutes.  The chicken here is okay if you get dark meat, but white meat is always dry and almost tasteless. Rice is bland, buns are hot and fresh, coleslaw is good, caesar salad has too much garlic, the chalet sauce is always awesome and ribs are hit and miss here.  The staff here seem overwhelmed and can come off rude at times. A couple of times they've made mix-ups with my order which is frustrating when you get home and notice that you got someone else's order and not yours. Or, they've given you your order but forgot the salad or the side.   I'm hoping that the dine-in experience here is better."}
{"text":"I used to order from here as one of my regular delivery places until I found a long black hair in my fries. Nothing makes me more disgusted than finding hair in food. This was definitely from the restaurant since it was tangled in the fries and I have blonde hair and no one in the condo has long black hair. I haven't ordered since and do not recommend due to sanitary and cleanliness issues."}
{"text":"The hostess and waitress were nice and attentive, but the food at this location is always over cooked.  Another example of a national chain needing to ensure that franchisees are keeping consistent.  I eat at Swiss Chalet in the Toronto area when on business, and there is no comparison..."}
{"text":"Is this the first, original, Swiss Chalet? It sure looks it. Broken signs on the door going in, tired interior. My table was so old and worn that the finish was letting bare wood showing through. The look is consistent with the mall it is in. Must have looked great when \"Funky Town\" was top of the charts...  Standard chicken larger portion of fries, which were greasier than normal and slightly under done.  Staff are very capable, but look like they would prefer to be doing something else.  If you're looking for \"Swiss\", you're better off driving further and getting a bit less with better TLC in a newer location."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Bad attitude. Won't accommodate a car seat and stroller. Not a family friendly restaurant. Won't be coming here anymore."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of people during the day and we were seated right away. This Swiss Chalet location looks about the same as any other Swiss Chalet place- warm colored furniture, casual atmosphere and groups of older people.  It was freezing in this place, but the service was warm, friendly and efficient. The food did not take long to come and you can tell the chicken dinners were already sitting somewhere in the back for a long time; it wasn't too fresh. The salads were ice-cold and bland and the rotisserie wrap was a bit soggy. The poutine however was delish and the chalet sauce was thick and hot. Dessert portions were generous which was nice.  They have their own parking lot which is convenient for those driving in. I'm not a big fan of this place and it seems that the food is hit and miss here."}
{"text":"This will be the last time I take a chance on this location. The take-out order was the worst we've had. The chicken was undercooked and rubbery, the whole grain rolls were rock hard, the fries dried out and cold and the sauce was watery.   On the plus side the little containers of free butter were at least worth what we paid for them."}
{"text":"Been trapped in the drive thru for over 20 minutes. No Swiss Chalet is worth this kind of wait. # shouldhavegonetowendys"}
{"text":"I had a quarter chicken dinner delivered from this location on Wednesday and I've been sick for the past three days. I've had food poisoning before and that's exactly what I have now. I will never order from here again."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong. I LOVE Swiss Chalet for its cheap meals and dipping sauce and generally reliable food. Once in a while the service is a bit spotty. But this incident was just over the top.  I order the chocolate sundae because I'm here with someone eating lunch, but I've already eaten elsewhere. And who doesn't love a good sundae?  \"You know you're supposed to eat your meal first. Oh well, it doesn't matter because you're f**king skinny.\"  Umm, thanks?  My companion also received the wrong meal.  I don't know whether to laugh or to cry."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre wish I went elsewhere. She brought me the bill before asking if I wanted dessert. Went to get frozen yogurt instead"}
{"text":"This Swiss Chalet is on the new side. It is very clean inside and has nice bathrooms. Food was typical Swiss Chalet."}
{"text":"As rotisserie chicken places go Swiss Chalet does it best. This location has friendly staff and nice seating."}
{"text":"The server meant well, but there were a bunch of small things gone wrong that she shrugged off. Individually, sure it's \"shruggable\". But all together, made my visit not enjoyable. As for the food,  ribs were cold, rolls were late that \"just came from the oven\" but were cold as well. The fries were good though! ... I would not come back. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all with the rudeness that my husband and I received from one of the waitresses there! First of all she wouldn't let me order anything off the festive menu, took the menu away from me and gave me an old one. Fine I ordered something else, then I noticed someone who came in later then me, got their food first and they received something off the festive menu, weird.  Then I go to drink my coffee and the mug was the dirtiest coffee cup I have ever seen!  The handle was sticky and there was food stuck to the inside of the cup and outside of it, gross!  I go to ask for a new mug and the waitress is no where to be found, so I got the attention of another waitress that apologized and got me a new cup.  The next thing that happened is the waitress purposefully asked another customer if he would like a refill while my husbands drink had been empty for a while now, she was clearly avoiding us. I am going to strongly suggest that you stay away from this location!  We usually go to the Swiss chalet in Oakville, where we have had no issues with the service of the waitstaff."}
{"text":"Love the fact that this location has a drive thru option to get your meal quick and effortlessly. However, going in there is a different story. I've been there a few times and each time the service was pretty slow and the food is a hit or miss.   Why do I keep on going back there? It's because there was this one time where the service was amazing and it was only because our server was absolutely wonderful. He noticed that we had movie tickets and asked what we were watching. When we told him he got excited and stated that him and his girlfriend want to watch that movie. He proactively asked what time the movie was and ensured that the service was impeccable so we wouldn't miss it. He came by to make sure everything was to our liking. Refilled our drinks without us asking. Gave us a free piece of cake since it was my friend's birthday and wished us a great at the movies. Needless to say, we tipped him very well and even gave him a free 2 person pass for the movies so he can take his girlfriend. He was speechless about it and thanked us over and over again.   Now I know what you're thinking \"Why the hell did you do that when that is what they are SUPPOSE to do for us as servers!\" The reason we did it was simple. He did a nice gesture for someone thinking that no one saw.   There was a young father sitting next to us with his daughter. We noticed that only the daughter was eating the usual Swiss Chalet meal and the father was having a small bowl of soup. We soon found out that it was her birthday, she turned 4 years old. Our server came out with a sundae and sang her Happy Birthday on the top of his lung shamelessly. However when the bill came, the gentlemen was super embarrassed because he realized that he was short a few bucks. Instead of looking for manager or looking upset, the server smiled gently at him turned to the daughter and said \"Happy Birthday Rosa!\" took the bill and said \"it's on me! You only turn 4 once!\" Gave the father a pat on the shoulder, a few encouraging words and sent them on their way.   I come to this location because of this particular server to be honest. It's nice to know that there are still kind-hearted people out there who care. =)"}
{"text":"I had a great lunch! Food here is always consistent, but what did it for me today was LAYTON!! Everything you want in a great server! Attentive, personable, up-selling without being obnoxious about it!! If you are going to this location, ask for her section!"}
{"text":"One of the worse restaurants I have ever eaten at, let alone in Canada.  Granted, Canada is not known for its cuisine but this was just wrong.  All three of my colleagues agree with my assessment and one of them is from Scotland...we know their food is just a step above English food."}
{"text":"Service is terrible here: they do not engage the customers when they are seated; the orders were taken incorrectly after we repeated the orders twice.   They took away our food before we were finished.   I understand that this is a chain restaurant, but better customer service training or at least training that is similar to other Swiss Chalet chains would really improve things.   This is the third time coming here and each time we hope the service has improved. Unfortunately this is the only the roast chicken fix in our area, so we have to settle for this.    They must really push to up sell on their beverages since the fries and and chicken are always too salty."}
{"text":"We used to go here a lot about 10 years ago. I always wondered why we stopped going. A recent visit and I know why.   We tried both the Chicken and the wings. Both were very dry and tasted less than fresh. The ribs were dry to the point of not being able to eat them. I thought I remembered the chicken as being very flavourful and moist. The chicken we ate was neither. The service was good, but not good enough to want to come back. I find the hot chicken at Safeway more flavouful and moist than what was being served here."}
{"text":"If I could give you a zero I would. There was a large group of us that come there and we should have known from the beginning that this was going to be bad.  There was a huge line up at the door, no one around to seat anyone and a huge restaurant empty??  After I had finally went through the restaurant, past the servers station and right into the kitchen did I find someone to seat the 18 people standing at the door and \"yes\" I did count everyone that was waiting.   When we were finally brought into the empty restaurant, they had sat us smack in the middle of the room, we had asked to be seated somewhere else as we don't like sitting in the middle of a big open space.  The server had made such a big deal of it. She was so rude and inconsiderate, never have I ever had service so poorly that we had gotten up from our table and went to another Swiss Chalet.   They had made us feel as we were a inconvenient to them. NEVER will we come back to this location."}
{"text":"Horrible service . I waited 20 min for only fries . Even people who had called in were pissed off at messed up orders . Avoid this location !!"}
{"text":"Partner ordered a couple of more times.  They are back on track -  lets hope it stays that way."}
{"text":"We came here after a long day at Canada's wonderland. To start with, the salad was fresh and really good, and when we couldn't decide which dressing we wanted our very considerate waitress brought out a few kinds. The service was good and fast. After some tasty wings, she brought us bowls of warm water and plenty of napkins. It was great because usually after wings I go wash my hands. Great place!!"}
{"text":"The new menu they launched a few months ago has a good mix of new offerings for everyone. We have enjoyed it and were surprised to see the improvement in taste and new offerings besides rotisserie chicken that they are most famous for."}
{"text":"Love the sauce, but service was slow and fries anemic..."}
{"text":"I agree with Jill C. that Swiss Chalet restaurants vary from place to place. I used to consider this location to be one of the best I've been to, but I feel they've slipped in the past year or more. It's not quite as good as it once was. I'm not sure if management has changed or not. My last order (delivery), i was given undercooked chicken. I find my wife and I are choosing to eat here less and less as time goes on. I don't feel the value is as good as it once was.  When I do go into the restaurant the service is usually good. Typically the food is done right, save for a few exceptions. Overall it's not bad, but not great in my opinion."}
{"text":"I really like this swiss chalet, as well as my boyfriend! We ordered the christmas special. The staff was very attentive even though it was CROWDED! Food was good and fresh, chicken was good, fries were good (nice and crispy). No complaints!"}
{"text":"I tried their chicken quesadilla with their greek salad. I would give that a 5/5  I also tried their chicken, nothing special, tastes like chicken, better than the ready to go at Loblaws etc. Fries are good. 4/5  Service is good 4/5  I would come back again!"}
{"text":"Not that great, waiter spilled pop all over, did not replace it. Chicken was dry... Wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"This Swiss Chalet has consistent food quality.   Sometimes I order takeout from here and sometime we dine in. Dining-in is child-friendly and the food portions are always larger then they are with takeaway.   The servers are generally very nice.   I highly recommend the new fried chicken on their menu - if you like fried chicken. It's pretty good."}
{"text":"I ordered a quarter chicken dinner to go. Quarter is right. The chicken was the size of a quarter (25 cents) that is. I don't know what size chicken that meal came from.  I will never go to this place again. Better off buying a read to go chicken from the supermarket."}
{"text":"This place is just horrendous. Years ago i remember coming here as a child and actually enjoying their chicken. I had always ordered their quarter chicken dinner with a side of fries. I had remembered it being tasty. Upon going recently and ordering a childhood favourite, it looked like the chicken had shrinked making it a 1/8th chicken. It was bland and tasteless. Yuck! I definitely do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Everything always tastes great at Swiss Chalet, but why have the portions become so small? Soon they will need to provide a microscope to find the chicken on the plate! And the prices keep going up. Not to mention the additional 1.40 for white meat, even if you order an 18$ rib/chicken combo meal. That's just pathetic. If someone orders an 18$ entree, they deserve to get the choice of white or dark meat at no extra cost. A yelp member from AZ questioned why Swiss Chalet is not in the southwest... because they would be laughed out of town with the small portions, high prices and charges for 'extras'."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery, came the first time but was missing condiments, the sour cream for my baked potato and utensils. Called them, the manager said they will resend, but after 1 hr of waiting, it still did not appear. Called them 3 times, but they were closed so no one picked up my calls hence I called customer centre. The girl was prompt to connect me to the store and the manager said that apparently they did but \"someone's husband answered the door declining the sour cream\"..... I HAVE NO HUSBAND!! As a result, because they were closed at the time, they can't send me my sour cream so they will resend my entire order to me the next day, I even made sure to ask that they will get everything perfect right? And the manager said of course. The next day (which is today), they did as they promised, BUT AGAIN NO SOUR CREAM OR UTENSILS OR CONDIMENTS. By now, I'm really upset that this happened twice. I call the restaurant again (this was around 8pm today) and the manager again promised to send my sour cream out for me. Never happened. Called the restaurant after 1 hr of waiting and like the previous day, no one picked up my call (but this time the restaurant wasn't closed yet, they were still open for another 30 mins). Once again, I called customer centre, after explaining what happened, the girl tried to connect me to the restaurant twice, but no one picked up so said she will rush out my order for me and leave a note for the restaurant to call them back about compensation to me. About 30 mins later, I got a call from customer centre saying something about either a rush out or a $5 credit and how I can't have both. So I said I have no idea what you're talking about so she connected me to the restaurant, and they picked up! However, the manager was very rude in dealing with me, he was yelling about how they were very busy as it was a Friday night and that his TWO delivery guys were out for delivery for TWO HOURS (it has been 2 hrs since I made the call to the restaurant about my still missing sour cream). I told him that he should give me some compensation in addition to my sour cream, and he got upset, asking me what I want. As I was very upset at my missing sour cream and his rude attitude, I replied, would you give me whatever request I made, and he said to be fair with him. He told me to give him a break, but as a customer I told him that it was his duty to fulfill the order I put in perfectly. He apologized, not very nicely though mind you, but said he can't do anything cuz there are no drivers at that time, BUT THEN a driver came back. So I have FINALLY GOTTEN MY SOUR CREAM after 48 hrs. Unbelievable."}
{"text":"Always consistent food and service, all the wait staff are great, you can go wrong with Swiss chalet"}
{"text":"Good family restaurant. Price is very good. Food is good, nothing fancy. Service is friendly, good and pretty fast as well. We have got to this place many times. They really care about customers."}
{"text":"We drove in after a long trip to Buffalo and were almost too tired to eat. Andrew, our server, took great care of us and always had a smile on his face. The food was fine, the same as all the other Swiss Chalets."}
{"text":"Disappointed!! When people have baked potatoes on menu they should have baked potatoes, and if not should offer some sort of compensation."}
{"text":"Nice for dinner!... I had a Quarter Chicken with poutine and spinach salad.. That was awesome!... on the other hand it is very near to my home!"}
{"text":"I come here because the waitresses are absolutely wonderful. Everyone is always smiling and in a great mood. My family and I have been coming here for a few years now and will continue coming here regularly as long as the waitresses don't change!"}
{"text":"Ugh! Never going back. Strange smell and average food. Only plus was the waitress who advised us to order less  also liked the lemon water dipping bowl at the end to clean hands."}
{"text":"I will not go back to this location. My experience is best described as something out of a Steven King movie. And Hello?! what is with the prices? omg! ok wtvr! But bring me a  chicken which  is cooked properly and fries that are are not cold! The banter and noises/sound coming from the kitchen was very off putting. They needed to turn the volume down...waaay down!"}
{"text":"Maybe it was just a bad day but it took about 30mins to seat 7 of us, not to mention RIDICULOUSLY PACKED!!!!!! Took about 20 mins before they could take our order, took another 20 to serve us gave us the wrong order of the same thing.. took about 40 mins for them to clean our table to bring us apple doughnuts, and another 20 mins for the bill.. You do the math, first and last time coming to this location.. (Unless dinner is free)"}
{"text":"I've never really been a big fan of Swiss Chalet. The chicken is always soggy and the I have never been a fan of the \"addictive sauce\" -- which to me just tastes like watery dish soap with a hint of cinnamon or cloves and a bay leaf. But hey, to each his own right?  I gave Swiss Chalet 3 stars (instead of the 2 I think it actually deserves) simply because I got an AMAZING deal from Red Flag Deals. Basically, I got to order whatever I want and get 1) a FREE appetizer, 2) a FREE dessert and 3) 15% off the entire bill for about 2 weeks or so. Needless to say, I ate at SC quite a few times with a bill of under $8 for a main, an app and dessert (costs about as much as a salad in my building).  Other than free office lunch meetings (it's located beside my workplace) and amazing coupons, I would not normally go to SC for chicken, ribs or soap sauce."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner and it was empty so we figured as the only customers we shouldn't have any problems. First I would like to note that the lovely waitress was amazing and felt embarrassed to serve us the food she brought .  We ordered two quarter chickens (one healthy alternative) and an order of spring rolls.  My girlfriend picked up her first spring roll and wrapped around it was a long hair .  Unpleased but not fully turned off yet, we sat patiently waiting for our mains to arrive .  When the regular quarter chicken arrived I cut into it and the meat in between the breast and the bottom layer was BLACK. Not a little bit black but fully black . I broke the chicken apart more to inspect it and the majority of the meat was covered in bloody spots and just grey in general.  We returned it to the waitress and when she brought it back to the chef I heard them laughing about us returning it , when the real joke of the night was the restaurant itself . The healthy alternative quarter chicken also had blood spots and was fairly pink but I have never in my life seen black chicken served. Save your money or drive to a different location!  Trust me ."}
{"text":"I never got the appeal of Swiss Chalet... there are some hard core swiss chalet diners and then there are others like me who go there once in a while either to make our coworkers feel more inclusive, or just for curiosity purpose.   The food is tasteless and it's hard to gulp it down unless you drench it in that gravy they give you. I used to get a side of pulverized vegetables but now I stick to what they know best and order fries instead. Their cheese cake was tasty though.  Except for comfort food, I don't find anything interesting, and I've tried a range of their menu!"}
{"text":"Alright...Well here it goes....We ordered spinach garlic pasta with chicken with sweet potato fries and mash.  The bread and sweet potato fries were super soggy and the pasta looks like it was someones leftovers literally thrown into a takeout container.  I'm going to post up the pictures of the nasty pasta as soon as we got it for proof.  Not only was the food horrendously cold, the driver was really rude.  \"I called you, you should check your phone once in a while\" (I had my phone with me...no calls)  I stared him down as he looked at the receipt then said \"so is this cash?\"  Needless to say I just wanted him out of my doorway so I paid him and he left.  Honestly, I've never had a bad experience with swiss chalet nor do I usually write any kind of negativity for these kinds of places BUT this was ridiculous.  On top of the driver, and the food, I called the customer service line and explained my situation.  They put me on hold for quite some time just to tell me \"unfortunately we can't do anything for you\"  What a load of BS.    Overall, what a GARBAGE establishment.  There will be no next time for me at this place."}
{"text":"Kids love Swiss Chalet and this is our go to location.  Very clean and the service is good . Manager here is kind and always check up on you.  Food is the same as all the locations and its not a bad thing.  Always tasty but the size of the Chix is slowly shrinking lol.  A pleasant dining experience for us always at this Swiss Chalet."}
{"text":"The fries were the saving grace of my chicken-rib combo, the chicken and ribs were so dry they must have precooked it and kept it under a heat lamp for hours or stuck it in the microwave.   There was another table in the empty restaurant who we could hear complaining about this very thing.   The ribs were so completely lacking in flavor I had to smother them in extra BBQ sauce. I only feel bad for the servers working here who have to defend this lazy kitchen"}
{"text":"I love the look of this new Swiss Chalet. It's great to have one up north for once and the food tastes just as good as you'd expect. It gets a little busy at times but that should be expected for any family restaurant. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a high quality, low cost dinner."}
{"text":"Roast beef dinner was disgusting. Full of fat and grissel.  Never again, stick with chicken."}
{"text":"A Swiss chalet drive-through that wants you to wait 15 mins to get your order because they are OUT OF CHICKEN....really ??? Come on!! Out of chicken, it's what the company in based on.   And what's the point of the convenient drive-through when it takes so long. Either cancel the drive-through method altogether and have only customers come in for takeout and dine in or do the drive through the right way for people on the go.  I'm not sure if all of the locations for Swiss Chalet are like this but the Wycroft location in brutal. Hopefully this location will improve their drive-through methods and have chicken ready!!!"}
{"text":"By far the WORST experience and most poor customer service I have EVER seen. I actually left a really nice review before this 1 year ago, that I now deleted because this was so bad it made me disregard the entire thing. I dont know if they switched owners or something when they moved but FIRST OF ALL the \"manager\" or so the person who said they were in charge tonight. If I could swear on this review I would say alot worse things than how he is the biggest most disgusting jerk ive ever spoken to. First of all we made our order at 8:18pm, but didnt get our order for an hour and 24 mins. We got our food and let me tell you this was not worth the $41. All our food was cold and rolls were rock hard. So we gave them a call because this is ridiculous. The main customer service office said that the store manager said all we could get was $10 dollars off our order but considering I could have found better food at a mall food court that was not good enough. So we asked to speak to this \"store manager\" where he kept telling us he will not go over a 10 dollar credit. We even suggested just a re order on a few items that were inedible and he flat out said no its too busy and the driver wont go out again. Then he said that it was under an hour that we got our food and when I corrected him that we recieved our food at 1 hr 24 mins  he then changed his story to under an hour and a half. Then changed his story again and said that there was no garentee orders tonight due to the weather. FYI IT WAS BARELY SNOWING by this time almost 945pm.. Ive had food delivered in blizzards ON TIME. (Wow I wish I could not do my job due to weather.) So after alot of back and forth and a reminder that my whole family and I have been comming here for 20 years and me asking if hes the manager why is it that I am only getting $10 off my crappy 41 dollar dinnner he simply said \"ok mam\" and hung up on me. Looking at the other reviews here id say amost  your whole establishment has turned into a joke, And its unfortunate because this for me in NO WAY represents your kitchen and waitress/ waiter  staff. They have never ever been nothing short of amazing in all aspects, every one of them. I hope you know that you lost alot of business tonight over something that could have been so easily fixed. I'm a reasonable person, I would have taken $20 off because all the food was cold and some not even edible. I wasnt expecting my whole meal compensated or anything ridiculous like that, which if you had actually listened we would have came to an agreement. So therefore None of my family will never walk through your doors again. And just a warning bad word of mouth spreds REAL fast in these parts."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on Family Day 2016.  It wasn't busy but the service was slow.  The food was barely warm.  It seemed like it took forever to get menus, then to get the drinks (all fountain pop), and even longer to have our orders taken and even longer for the, just above room temperature, food to be brought out to the table.  We decided to take our children's dessert to go cause we already spent 1.5 hours in the restaurant.    It was very unusual.  We normally love Swiss Chalet.  Their food is usually piping hot and delicious and their service is nice.    This has never happened to us before.    Did we contact the manager?  No.  It was our daughter's birthday and there were 8 of us in total and because she didn't seem upset or bothered we didn't want to make a scene and have her feel uncomfortable.  As I said this was very unusual for the chain."}
{"text":"I eat Swiss c weekly and this location refused to give me 2 salad dressings with my $13 salad!! I'm never going to be returning here again!what a joke"}
{"text":"Got take out for my family, was surprised when the food arrived in awful condition, the fries were raw, the wings were old and actually tasted disgusting. Called the chain and they replaced the awful food...with more awful food. Learned my lesson, Swiss chalet, never again."}
{"text":"This is our default delivery restaurant. The food is generally the same as any other Swiss chalet, in terms of quality. But, every time we order, someone makes a mistake. It's become a family joke, because we have to call the store every single time, to have something sent out because we had received either the wrong item or they'd forgotten the item altogether. Tonight was over the top, though. Tonight, they forgot to put rolls in the meals, they forgot the pie, and they sent the wrong soup. We called. About an hour later, we got those parts of the meal. At the end of the meal, I was putting things in the fridge, and checking the containers we hadn't opened. I opened a chalet sauce container, and then a coleslaw container. Then, I opened the third container and there was a coleslaw that had almost been completely eaten already! It was definitely NOT as the store and customer service staff and then the manager tried to convince us, possibly, just 'a small portion.' There were fork marks of mayo up one side of the container and there were literally two spoonfuls left. SO. DISGUSTING. After some discussion, and going to the manager, we did get a refund, which is the only reason for the one star, instead of zero, but we definitely weren't interested in the store credit. Yuck."}
{"text":"the food was terrible and the customer service was just a atrocious! I convinced a friend to return despite their own negative experience and to my dismay the whole dining experience was dismal, at best.  The chicken was raw then it was replaced with scorched blackened dried chicken.  Looks like I pissed off the cook (not willing to use the term \"chef\" freely).  I feel sorry for older patrons with poor eyesight.  They could very well be consuming samonella undercooked chicken unknowingly!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  If you go, bring some vision-wear."}
{"text":"I ordered the hot chicken sandwich with fries and mixed vegetables.  The vegetables were very tasty, the sandwich had good flavour but was barely warm, and the fries tasted like they had been re-heated in the microwave.    The server (a teenage boy) was really trying, but was a bit awkward.  He came by often, but hung around a bit too long for awkward conversation, and then he wasn't around when we needed something (like cutlery to eat our food after it was served)."}
{"text":"Good food. Friendly waitress. There was no one dining at the time I went (3:00-4:00). Not sure how service would be when busy. Bring a sweater it is a bit cold inside"}
{"text":"Came here on what I thought was going to be a slow night. There was about 12+ tables, all of which had a range of 2-10 people. There was one hostess and one waitress for the whole restaurant. I ordered a classic chicken dinner. Took way longer than usual to get it. Once I did, I was to find the chicken was undercooked. I politely asked the waitress to recook it. The just gave me another one. They said that the next one was on the grill and \"well done\". As I start tearing into this chicken, I come to find it was also raw 100% in the middle. Not okay, all they said was \"it happens all the time\".  I love swiss chalet but very disappointed in the way this was handled."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst. Go to Wendy's grab a baked potatoe and a whole chicken from sobeys."}
{"text":"Had lunch there today. Staff is customer friendly and food was good. Definitely go there again."}
{"text":"We went to Swiss Chalet looking for a homey nostalgic dinner. Unfortunately service was ridiculously slow. It took the waitress 20 minutes before even taking our drink order. Another 10 before we saw water. The food was over salted we. Perogie appetizer was plated sadly. Not great."}
{"text":"Mainly serve roasted chicken and ribs. Chicken is pretty much the same as every other Swiss Chalet out there. You know exactly what you are getting. Kids love the chicken spring rolls.   This location is the express version catering mainly to the take out crowd.  There is seating for about 20."}
{"text":"Caveat Emptor on the club wrap.  Frozen on the inside and clearly either microwaved or warmed up another way. If you're looking for freshly prepared, this item isn't recommended."}
{"text":"I love going to Swiss Chalet but this was the 1st one where I said not again! We arrived around 4:30 pm and were seated promptly after fighting our way through the jammed outside door. I noticed the place seemed a bit run down-the chairs were ripped, the bathroom had holes in wall, etc. Our waiter seemed like a nice guy but I think he was overworked or a rookie. He got our order wrong a couple of times.  After waiting for about what seeed like a half hour our order finally came.  He did apologize for the wait because of our kids order.  They had the cheese pizzas-how long does it take to cook a doily size pizza??? We had the half chicken and french fries.  We ordered gravy on the fries but there was none to be found on mine or my wifes' plate. He arrived with the gravy in little bowls and Im glad we did get it because the fries were tastless and dry.  The chicken was cold and dry.  It seemed like our plates were sitting on the counter for some time while our kids complicatd cheese pizzas were being prepared by the gourmet chefs! By then it was about 5 + and getting dark outside-warning bring a flashlight to inspect food because the lighting in that place is next to none.  It seemed they were going for more of a romantic mood than a family restaurant feel. I almost expected the classic little candel on our table with Frank Sinatra playing in the background!    Anyways when we were done wolfing down our cardboard meal my wife realized that she ordered the ceaser salad and it did not come. We asked the waiter about this and sure enough he charged it to us but reversed it on the bill.  We then got our sundaes, 2 small sized cups for kids and one large one for me and my wife to share.  He brought ours and it was the same size as our kids'!  I said to her that she can just have it since it would look rather silly for us to be eating out of a dixie size cup!    After we hounded them for us to give them our money we ran out of there saying never again while the old, bland chicken sat like rocks in our stomachs.  The best part of the night was going to bed without having to throw up!!"}
{"text":"When entering this place, it smelt like the whole place was mopped with dirty old water. The seats and table tops were dirty and the whole place gave out a old stingy vibe. The ice cubes in our drinks gave off a taste as if their  machine filter was never changed.   No staff to welcome us at the door, they were impolite all throughout our stay.  The food was absolutly discusting, it was so bad( cold, too moist, and had a bad smell to it) that we didn't finish our meal."}
{"text":"I love Swiss Chalet, this is my first bad experience. They BURNED my chicken!"}
{"text":"swiss chalet has been diversifying it food and beverage mix over the years, but the prices they charge for those new exotic rice and pasta dishes are a little north of $15 that's new ventured territory for swiss chalet which i've come to know as a chain offering meals under $10.  (except for ribs) it does make sense from them to explore different menu options to have some variety besides chicken, & ribs.  i'm a traditionalist when i go to swiss chalet and only order the chicken and the fries. about the only thing i change is how much meat I'm having depending on how i hungry i feel. :)  you have: quarter chicken, half chicken, double leg (good value) and for sides as i mentioned i only do the fries..carbalicious!!   the chicken i ordered (white) was fresh however the sauce was concentrated and salty. sauce consistency varies among swiss chalet restaurants;  rec. they use measuring cups or taste it people! fries were spot on.   the location and layout is narrow and small (like a 50 person max limit). the lighting is a dreary fluorescent pink. the restaurant could use some colourful art on the walls to spruce things up.   a plus if you stay in, there are large tvs to watch a raptors/jays game here while feasting  however i would rather opt for take-out."}
{"text":"Okay I admit I have a soft spot for Swiss Chalet.  For me, it's the sauce that keeps me coming back. ;) You either love it or hate it.   Decor at this North York location is traditional. The furniture is a light maple with fabric upholstered seating. There are tables or booths. Most of the Swiss Chalet restaurants around the Greater Toronto Area are modeled this way so if you've gone to one lately the look will be familiar.    We went for dinner on a weekday. It wasn't too busy and it was quiet enough to have a conversation. Our food came out in less than 10 minutes. I ordered 1/3 rack of ribs, 1/4 chicken dinner with fries as my side. Tasted fine and hit the spot. :)  Ordered a coconut cream pie for dessert -- this sadly wasn't very good. Ranks slightly above a McCain frozen coconut cream pie in my books.   There's only a 5 parking spots for the restaurant outside. Restaurant is nestled off on a side road North of Yonge St and York Mills Ave.  I guessing most of the patrons visit this location for lunch from the offices nearby.  Parking is free after 4pm in the garage next door."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  We asked to see the manager, who never bothered to come to our table.  Food bland.  Very different from other Swiss Chalet locations.  Stay away!"}
{"text":"WHY doesn't USA have these?  (there are a couple, not in AZ ;-(  After not having rotisserie chicken in over 6 mths (my last visit to candada, eh?)  this met all and any expectations!!  Who~Hoo!!  Dipping sauce: Classic Chicken: Juicy & Tasty Fries: I CHEATED I KNOW!! i just HAD to have them! Kids Meals: Off the charts - includes drink and sundae for about $6 & a prize from the treasure chest - something i used to do when i was a child ~sniff~  Swiss Chalet - you didn't disappoint - LUV YA!"}
{"text":"Had to get in as many visits here as possible while visiting Canada, eh?  Didn't disappoint.  I REALLY cheated here by not only ordering fries (omg  i am soooooo bad) but had to have to garlic loaf - Mmmmmmmmmm.  Y U M M Y : -)"}
{"text":"Worst Swiss Chalet experience ever. My boyfriend and I ordered two can dine 1/4 chicken dinner with fries and seasoned rice. Fries and rice are definitely leftover food, fries are all broke short, rice is dry. Chicken is very salty. The only 2 things we liked on our plates are buns and sauce. Never come back again."}
{"text":"I came here for my mother's birthday and was extremely disappointed.  I have been to many swiss chalets, I have even worked at one and tonight was the worst time I've ever had at a Swiss chalet. Our server  had 1 table in her section when we arrived and had a max of 4 tables for the night. Our server was never around, I felt she was hiding from the guests she was only seen when food was coming out of the kitchen. We needed refills but she was neglecting our table. The whole table finished there drinks and was not even offered a single refill by any staff Nor were we given water. We also were not given any water with lemon to wash our hands at all.   Majority of our party ordered ribs and was disappointed with not even a alcohol wipe to clean our hands. We were asked if we wanted the bill and responded yes and waited 15 minutes before asking another server to get the bill for us. My expectations were high as this is restaurant just opened. This is definitely not a great start for this location. Unfortunately this bad experience has made it clear I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"So here it goes ....  Sad to see how this chain has gone down the drain over the years... Especially in the last 3-5 yrs. What a disappointment to what used to be a memorable childhood experience .... The quality of the food, the size of the portions and the overall experience just makes people want to stay away from this chain of restaurants.  They have expanded their menus but what's the point when there's no appeal. I ordered the new chicken salad and the shrimps, and my friend ordered chicken and ribs. Ribs looked like they were few days old... The knife wouldn't even go thru the meat, it was that hard and inedible. There were plenty of salad dressings  ...I could only eat part of the salad... Shrimps were ok.  The only somewhat decent thing we had was the coconut shrimps.  Service is ok, it's the same folks we know and have seen for years and they seem to try their best to accommodate you. (It's really a hit and miss). We sent the ribs back but we weren't even offered a full refund.   Just too bad... We (used) come here often, and it's been a tradition of ours but less and less as of late...just not sure if I'd even return again. The food experience in the last few visits has not at all been up to par. Perhaps Swiss Chalet is still a thing in the suburbs but In a city where there's so many choices I am left to wonder why I need to spend my $ here and or why I need to give them, yet again, another chance. Sad but true. Total disappointment end to end! :("}
{"text":"I have been to other swiss chalet restaurants, and this is the first time I have gotten sick. Also I noticed the management was rushing the waitresses and it appears as though they are overworked! I will not be coming back to this location ever again."}
{"text":"Terrible service, below average meals, and disinterested staff. It took our table of 12 nearly 30 minutes to have our bills settled up, all while our server complained loudly about the system they're using. I felt particularly bad for the single gentleman at the next table who was ignored for 30 minutes before taking his coat and leaving with an empty stomach.  Management here stinks, and it shows in all facets of what they offer their customers."}
{"text":"The service was poor, the waitress was rude. Me and my family order healthier Alternative Quarter Chicken with 3 diet Pepsi. The amount of food on the plate was less food than the other Swiss chalet location  and we were hungry so we had to order dessert. The chicken was dry, the diet Pepsi from the machine taste awful, ask for another drink,  the waitress gives another diet Pepsi from the can. The waitress and the chef were arguing in the kitchen for a few minutes."}
{"text":"Very loud when I'm inside all I can hear is extremely loud talking food is ok, but still it sort of ruined the experience."}
{"text":"It's the standard nice taste of swiss chalet, but in a downtown setting. The one annoying thing is the stairs to the restrooms are too high so they're a safety hazard"}
{"text":"I thought the inside was fairly nice, being a chain and all. I didn't really know what to expect.  The food was pretty good. It wasn't anything to be amazed by though. I'm really not a fan of their signature sauce. I thought it was kinda strange. My waitress was really nice. She refilled my drink exactly when I needed it to be.  All in all not a bad experience. Its not going to go at the top of my list for favourite places to eat though."}
{"text":"I used the call ahead to for a large pick up order I had been forewarned that even with this service you could wait up to 40 minutes to get your order  Armed with this information I called in the order at 4 pm for a 5:30 pick up and confirmed several times on the call and was assured order would be ready as it had been called in early. This was not the case as when I arrived I was asked to pay and waited 15 min before I asked to speak to manager who did finally get my order. All the while the drive through window had orders rolling. I told manager maybe I should have done the drive through and waited 15 min there until the order was ready. Next time if there ever is one I will ask for a refund and find somewhere to eat. Sad because family likes the food but service is piss poor and will never patronize again. Corporate should investigate as this location has bad rap locally for pissy service."}
{"text":"I generally like to eat at Swiss Chalet when I travel to Toronto on business. I have experienced the gambit of great to poor service at locations. This one was on the great service end. Salad was just OK but the tomatoes were not quite edible. Rotisserie chicken was good as usual as was the baked potato. Unfortunately there was a party of 10 adults with 10 unsupervised kids behind me that were really loud. It kind of spoiled the experience. I was the only quiet and non-asian person there."}
{"text":"One of the better Swiss Chalets in the city. Clean and spacious, although it can get crowded during busy hours. Excellent coconut cream pie and great service."}
{"text":"Worst Swiss Chalet I have ever visited. Went with my family to have a good time, left feeling vaguely disgusted and overall unhappy with the food and service. The servers were nice enough, but not very professional and didn't know how to deal with the poor experience. Our order came incorrectly twice, and took a looong time to arrive. The food felt old and was cold, my beef was barely edible. They had no spoons. Literally. What kind of restaurant has no spoons? Aside from the terrible food and poor service, the entire restaurant felt unclean and kind of gross. I highly recommend that you check out a different location.

{"text":"It's ok here! I love their normal menu, this place the house salad was iceberg lettuce with a few shredded carrots and 4 thin slices of cucumber quartered and a quarter slice of tomato, very boring place for healthy eaters!! Boston pizza next door I think would be better !!"}
{"text":"My fave Swiss Chalet is this one because it has a very positive vibe due to its proximity to the movie theatre. The people who eat there are usually excited to see a movie so it puts everyone including the staff in a good mood. Kid's meals are good value, I believe $10.99 gets you a main, a drink, a dessert (ice cream sundae is the best value) and a toy. Half chicken is too much (portion wise), but quarter chicken is not enough (for me). Chicken parm kaiser is delicious too. Nice that they have a change table in the men's bathroom, but unfortunately I don't think it's cleaned very often because there are dirty diapers where the bed liners are supposed to be :( Fast, friendly service, as expected. Nice to see the calorie counts on the menu now too, but it's so easy to turn a blind eye. See you next time Swiss Chalet :)"}
{"text":"Always a good meal, especially for those with families. Kids meal is super worth it. A main, a side, a drink, a dessert and a toy all for 6.99! Staff and service are consistent, friendly and fast. Atmosphere is casual and inviting. Much more relaxed than the burloak location."}
{"text":"My friends and I had a stand-out dining experience-- at Swiss Chalet, of all places! We came just thirty minutes to 10:00pm, when they stop taking new customers. Although it was the end of a long Saturday shift, and although there were six of us, our server was just incredible. We were in awe of her cheerful, enthusiastic nature, and she truly made our night. We also appreciated that she let us stay even after all of the other customers had left. We'd gotten into such a deep conversation that we'd forgotten to leave! And even though it was the end of the night, the food was fresh and delicious-- perhaps better than any other Swiss Chalet experience we've had in the city.   Much appreciation, Queens Quay team!"}
{"text":"Same as most swiss chalet, the only downfall is that you have to get your parking validated and its time in which you get your food is alittle longer the  average"}
{"text":"For the most part I thoroughly enjoy Swiss Chalet, but this location isn't on my \"hurry back\" list. It has a very cafeteria like feel to it as it is completely open with no privacy whatsoever. It kinda seats like a GO Train car as all tables face one another and they concentrate all guests to one particular section (probably because they're short on waitstaff). This old dude eating by himself who was sitting directly across from me kept staring at me and it made me uncomfortable. Maybe I had something on my face!?  Anyhow on this particular visit, we were in town staying at the Delta Chelsea Hotel and looking for a quick (and somewhat healthy) bite to eat. We had originally intended to go to the Pickel Barrel but the wait was too long so we jumped ship and went to the Chalet.   We got in and ordered, got our food pretty quickly but it was wrong even after making it perfectly clear what we wanted to order, twice. Had to send it back and she just brought the same food out on a different plate (..okay?). The food was alright but nothing to write home to Zurich about. The waitress also forgot our waters - normally I would let this slide but she only had about 3 other tables on our section to worry about and she wasn't being very attentive (she was the diner type whom you would visualize wearing roller skates and blowing pink bubblegum bubbles while taking your order from the driver side window of your car). I guess I can't expect too much from a place directly on Yonge Street. In a location where a vagrant holds the door for you on the way out and then extends a Coffee Time cup expecting a valet-type tip.  Anyway, I guess if you're tired at the end of the day and just want something quick and mediocre, go here. But if not head to the Pickel Barrel or one of the other nifty places on Yonge Street.  Rating: 2.5 Rotisserie Chickens and a dried out Quarter Chicken Dinner."}
{"text":"This place had a nice dining room and friendly service, but the food was bad.  The chicken (rotisserie leg quarter) was bad.  It looked a bit pink and was chewy.  I eat a lot of dark meat chicken, and I've never had chewy leg and thigh meat.  I just don't see how a place with rotisserie in their name can screw this up and charge $9 for the plate.  I converted my side to poutine for $1.99 more and they really skimped on the cheese.  It was a ton of fries with a medium amount of gravy and a small amount of cheese.  I'd had poutine probably 5 other places on this trip to Canada, and even fast food places like Harvey's gives more cheese.  Sad.  I guess the reason they don't have wifi is to avoid reviews like this in the moment."}
{"text":"Fries were great, as usual. I had a craving for their delicious, fall off the bone ribs so I paid the big bucks and had the quarter chicken & half rack of back ribs combo. The ribs were overcooked and tough while the chicken was tiny. My wife's chicken parmesan and daughters chicken strips were also overcooked. Our order was taken promptly but we waited forever for the food. Arrived at the restaurant at 6:15 and barely made it to an 8:00 show at the theater 10 minutes away. I've had takeout from here and never had issues. Probably won't dine in again."}
{"text":"The food is fine - your usual Swiss Chalet - but the owners of this location are overwhelmed and it reflects badly on the chain. I ordered online for pickup. Arrived to pick up and there were probably 30-40 meals piled on the counter, staff seeming to have no idea what they were doing, the location wasn't clean. Added bonus - they charged me twice. I paid online, told them when I went to pick up that I paid online, they insisted that's not possible and charged me again. Nobody answers the phone there, so good luck seeing that money again!"}
{"text":"I love Swiss Chalet and like to dine at this location because of their parking lot compared to other locations.  This location used to have awesome service when they first opened but lately I realized service has taken a bit on the slow side.  Just beware that orders are placed in sequence (so if you see a big party size of 25+ ppl check with your server for their food wait times if you're in a rush), also their dark 1/4 chicken pieces are getting smaller and smaller.  Don't be afraid to ask them to give you a bigger piece.  Also, their Shirley temple reminds me of toilet water in my opinion."}
{"text":"Okay like this Swiss chalet is soy annoying I just hate like really much God no service for like 5 days I can't believe it !! My friend Matt literally needs to take his pills but guess what they didn't serve him so he died of dehydration and  diarrhea like what the actual fuck I'm calling. Police because this shit is fucking real I swear someone just gave birth in my face and molested my children fuck this"}
{"text":"Can't really complain about Swiss Chalet, it's always fresh and delicious. Only downfall is the long wait time at this location."}
{"text":"This restaurant needs bussers to help the servers out..i've been here before and experienced horrible customer service. this time i experienced better but not because the restaurant changed anything but because the server actually cared."}
{"text":"I prefer this location to the old one across the street that is for sure, and I like the updated look.  I like how bright the place is, however, the service is hit and miss.  The chicken pot pie is very good.  I can't count on the 1/4 chicken dinners any more at any Swiss Chalet."}
{"text":"This location was a surprise! First of all, it is in the weirdest plaza which you would not expect a Swiss Chalet to be in. My friend wanted to go here because they have a play area for the kids. I had no idea SC did that sort of thing?  Okay so they play area is not fancy but the kids and other children in the restaurant seemed to approve of it. I liked that there was a little seating area near the play area that they put all the louder families like us. The restaurant is way bigger than it looks so other, kid free diners would have been able to eat without hearing from kids. Awesome.  Service was quick, efficient and friendly. They had a little trouble if we asked something of them that broke them from their routine but it wasn't a deal breaker. Food was as expected....I mean it is Swiss Chalet. It was very hot and fresh too!  The best part was that while it was busy, we had no trouble getting a table. Very important when you have little ones in tow!"}
{"text":"I get to the take-away counter regularly (dining room service is too slow at lunch).  Keep an eye of your orders... the last time I was there they gave my order of a 6 leg dinner to a guy that only ordered a quarter dinner.... to top it off, they said I didn't order what I order even though I still had the receipts in my hand!"}
{"text":"I do enjoy Swiss Chalet. I know it is more of an eastern Canada thing, and a chain, but I like it. The chicken is tasty and served in many forms, the fries are delish and the dipping sauce is good.  There is something for everyone on the menu and is good for people of all ages. It is nothing fancy, so it is a great spot when you want something easy but better than fast food. It also makes great take out and delivery.  The quarter chicken dinner is an old time favourite but I also love the chicken pot pie. For bigger appetites, there are some good rib and chicken combos too. They've also improved their appetizer menu.  Whether you are looking to take the family somewhere or grabbing a bite with your special someone, Swiss Chalet can be a great spot and relatively inexpensive."}
{"text":"I am starting this off by saying this was the worst service I have ever received.   We had a group of eight, my family visiting from out of town. Three kids and five adults. First thing they said was there is a 15% gratuity, normal for large groups no problem. We sat down and were told we couldn't get 2 of the kids a kids meal.... Really!!! Out of the three kids one was 9 one 10 and one 12, 2 of which were within their under 10 policy. They said they didn't look 10. How can you prove this while out at a restaurant and the guests came from out of town, Ridiculous but with 8 people we decided not to pack up and go to another restaurant. The service only got worse from there as they got an attitude with my mother in law. My father in law had to tell the manager to be more polite.   Our meals came 10-15 minutes apart, one person was done eating by the time the last received their meal. To top it off a baked potato arrived rock hard and cold, we asked them to heat it or replace it, they microwaved it and brought it back but the potato was rock hard. The waitress even apologized because the manager didn't handle the situation very well. He said at this time of night all our potatoes are hard and dry.... Really!    To top it off, we were not offered anything, not that it was mandatory, but just goes to show their customer service levels.   I looked at the review and was unsure of whether or not to come.... DON'T COME THE REVIEWS ARE TRUE!!!"}
{"text":"When we got here for dinner, we waited 10 minutes or less for our table, which I'm ok with since it was Friday night, dinner time. When we sat down, the server took our drink orders, gave us menus, and disappeared. We ordered appetizers (cheese perogys - nothing special), and chicken and ribs for dinner. We had trouble getting refills on our beverages, when our mains came, my boyfriend was missing his ribs, and we had no cutlery, so we just sat there looking for the server to ask for some. She went to the table behind, and then came to us and kind of \"barked\", \"Do you guys have a problem?\" So we explained what we were missing. She said she would ring up some ribs (cause she missed it the first time), and she just went to the next table when we sat there for another little while waiting for a fork and knife lol! The food was decent for the price, but the service was pretty awful!! I will not be returning to this Swiss Chalet for sure."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants that was in the states. Brought my dad here for his birthday and we enjoyed the special posted on the window 2 for $15. The decor was great and so was our server Rita. Very friendly and personable.  As expected, our food was great and i love the decor."}
{"text":"This Swiss chalet use to be slow as molasses and had terrible service. The new manager came up to introduce herself right away which was nice. The food came quickly they only missed one side of gravy from our order. Glad to see the improvement."}
{"text":"No heat. One server for 30 people. Slow. Cold food. No compensation for freezing over lunch. Always so good for so little is a jingle for patrons, not franchisees! Pay your bills and hire some staff! It wouldn't hurt to advise the greeter that perfume is not to be showered in.  Every request had to be repeated 3 times. Never again."}
{"text":"Zero stars but can't do that, this review is based on my one and only experience that I had here at this location. The chicken was not fresh, we ordered spinach dip and it looked like it was served to a different table and then topped and served to us, It looked disgusting and I could not eat from it at all. My chicken was very oily and did not taste good. I am very disappointed. My buddy complained and the manager was very nice, apologetic and offered us a %20 discount and did not charge for the dip. Over all I am not pleased but again it is my only experience at this location."}
{"text":"Exactly what you would expect from Cara foods.  High prices and mediocre food.  Staff not as good  as before the reno.  Service still decent and quick."}
{"text":"First time going to Swiss Chalet.  And last.  Good service but food is pretty meh.   I'm sure there are better options then this."}
{"text":"Always a fair good meal. One of the citys best meals. True value for you money."}
{"text":"I give this location a perfect rating because  it was the perfect Swiss chalet visit I have had in a long time. We got there at 7pm on a Sat it was busy  But it was no problem the staff was great they all worked together  like a team. Food was hot and perfect. Other locations should  learn from this location."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Swiss Chalet  sense 1967 and this was the worst. No one to great us at the door a waitress holding dirty dishes came up to us and said someone will be here shortly.  Server took are order and food came out first was a ceaser salad plate was dirty (see pic) second was greasy spring rolls (see pic) then chicken with burnt nasty fries also see pic. What ever happened to free refills  on are pop . I thought when my meal  done the server was going to left my plate but instead she put some papers on my empty plate and walked away.  There was a lot of yelling from staff how they had no change. We paid by debt card and left. It was a Thursday night 7.30 and it was slow. What ever happened to Swiss Chalet?"}
{"text":"yuck.  I went to this place when my family was in town because my sis brought her 2 kids and this place seemed kid friendly.   The first problem was when my sis needed to take said kids to the washroom. It was completely disgusting and she ended up taking them across the street.  Next came time to order. I asked for the chicken wrap, but asked for (i think) different cheese on it than it came with and was informed that the wraps are pre-made and can't be altered. WTF?  I decided on the chicken sandwich since, well, its not pre-made...and it was so dry I might as well have been eating the wrap that was probably made 7 days ago.  no one enjoyed their meal. No reason to be back. Ill stick to the fried chicken at Rabba (which is really effing good somehow..)  BYE FELICIA"}
{"text":"Went to dinner here with some friends this past Sunday. When we arrived it wasn't busy and we were seated very quickly. They had a special on , half or full rack ribs comes with free 1/4 chicken, which a few friends tried and enjoyed. I varied from my usual chicken pot pie because I had to try the new crispy ribs.  They certainly weren't as good as the regular ribs but they were still good. I know that all of their other food is good and tasty so I'm not knocking down any stars for that! The food arrived very quickly, nice and hot. No complaints from anyone at the table. The waitress was very attentive even when it started to get busy later in the meal. Desert was excellent as always.  This is the cleanest Swiss Chalet location I have ever been to. Currently they are holding some form of draw where if you order the special you can enter to win a Samsung tablet, I don't remember how long this is running for but it's still super cool!"}
{"text":"Delivery is hit and miss...usually gravy doesn't show up with the mashed potatoes as I ordered and if I ordered extra dipping sauce it is also missing, even though I'm billed and have paid for it. Orders should be checked carefully before they go out for delivery, every time. Have checked order on arrival myself  and accepted it as is up to now (it's not the driver's fault) but will now deduct missing items from bill and pay delivery guy only for what he brings, if we decide to use Swiss Chalet delivery again."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre. I ordered quarter chicken with 1/2 rack of ribs and poutine as the side. They gave me fries rather than the poutine I wanted but I was fine with it and did not want to ruin quality time with my mom. Our server was nice enough to grab cheese and gravy for my fries. However, while OUR server was nice and sweet, some of the staff were rude. This one lady kept staring at my mom and I and kept whispering to another staff as well. She may not have been talking about us but she might as well have with the looks she gave us.  Haven't been to Swiss Chalet in years, but was craving some food, didn't know I'd get attitude as well."}
{"text":"We went here tonight. The service was much quicker, it was a Monday night at 6:00 P.M. This went very well, with great 1/4 chicken dinner.  It got busier at 6:30 P.M., but service was still very fast.  Thank you for my wife joining me to enjoy this evening out."}
{"text":"I'll be honest, i never go here unless i've grabbed a coupon. It just isn't worth the menu prices. But, if you have a coupon and your not looking for a place with great servers this is a good one. Got to the place and had to wait around at the door to be seated as no one was at greet, despite the restaurant being mostly empty during dinner time. Ordered the garlic bread as the appetizer, quarter chicken meal, and a brownie with ice cream. The garlic bread was tasty. The quarter chicken chickens have gotten smaller, if your looking to get a bigger piece order the white meat and pay extra. The chicken and fries were okay. The brownie is a disaster as it's wayyyy to sweet and has the wrong consistency for a brownie. The server was not rude but definitely not friendly and the time it took to get our meals was ridiculous as most of this food could basically be considered fast food. Overall, i'll go again if I have a coupon, but would stay away otherwise."}
{"text":"Food was brought to the table without any cutlery on the table had to ask two servers to get us some. Real hard to eat chicken pot pie with your fingers."}
{"text":"I had the worst dining experience in my 12 years living in Toronto here. First off we stood at the front waiting to be seated for at least 5 minutes even though it wasn't too busy. We ordered the rotisserie beef sandwich, steak, and the beef kaiser sandwich. The two sandwiches came cold and soggy with the rotisserie beef sandwich looking particularly like leftover chili vomit. Who thought that it would be a good idea to drench bread with greasy gravy? We were brought our plates separately with the waiter forgetting who ordered what (there was only 3 of us). Combine this with the primary school cafeteria food and it was $50 well spent. What a joke."}
{"text":"I admit it, I like Swiss Chalet. Maybe because it reminds me so much of Chalet Barbecue in Montreal or just the spicy edge to their sauce. This is a combined Swiss Chalet/Harvey's with the Harvey's drive-thru and Harvey's take-out doing duty for the Swiss Chalet take-out and drive-thru. Service was good. Currently they have a special with a baked potato chowder, serving is small but it is nice and thick too."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Swiss chalet so yummy the chicken is the best when you are wanting comfort food I don't really order anything else cause the other food isn't that great , but when you can dine for 2 and get a deal that's normally when I come ! So yummy"}
{"text":"So far it's been 20 mind for the waitress to come by and tell us she will be with us in a few minutes. No water nothing ..still.waiting. it's not busy. 10 tables eating . 4 waitresses no line up.  Dinner finally came . . Chicken dry . Ribs were good . Fries cold and soggy. .. Waitress never came back . Now waiting  for a cheque so we can get out of here .  Over all a horrible chalet experience ."}
{"text":"Went home to eat my dinner and found that my chicken was uncooked. When I complained I was met with an attitude by an employee. When I asked for his name at the beginning of the conversation, his name was Jason. At the end of the call I was given a different name. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Swiss Chalet is a dependable chain that offers a variety of protein dishes to satisfy diners.  It's my favourite \"fast food\" type of place as at least it offers semi-healthy meats that are not fried.  What stood out with this chain however was the service we received.  Our waiter, Amit, was attentive, alert, personable and was able to anticipate our every need, all done with a smile and very positive and infectious attitude.  He wasn't the only one either...we could see the other waiters and waitresses being just as charming and attentive to their patrons.  Kudos to the general manager for training such a remarkable staff.    Amit really was a huge factor in us having a wonderful experience at this restaurant.  His attitude and helpfulness put waiters in 5 star restaurants to shame!"}
{"text":"Some would call me crazy for rating Swiss Chalet 5 stars...back off haters. Swiss Chalet is my Jam. Since moving to America in high school, I crave the rotisserie chicken that Americans still can't replicate...it's delicious. And that dipping sauce...yaaaasss. Add the cheap wine and poutine and you've got an addict right here. You can easily get in and out of this location in 40 minutes. It's fairly new or its been kept up with well. Very clean and the staff were very helpful and quick to serve us."}
{"text":"Worst over the phone experience. I called and placed and order for 2 half chicken dinners. I called back less then 2 minutes later just to change one of the side and was on hold for over 15 min. By the time I go though to someone they said they couldn't do anything because the order had already left the store. I was out on hold again and waited another 10 min for them to call the driver. Long story short, I'm very upset with the service."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch this week. The service is mediocre and the cook doesn't care what the food looks like that goes to the customer's table. Fries for example are plated with burnt bits. It's as if he dump the food on the plate and fling it at the server. They charge you extra for the white chicken meat, however, the size of the chicken has shrunk to the lowest of the lows. Swiss Chalet has fallen down into the ditch, and they aren't getting out anytime soon. They have become a greedy, uncaring chain and that will be their demise. The prices have been going up often but the quality and quantify of the food has gone down the the pits. Good bye."}
{"text":"Ordered a 1/2 chicken combo with back ribs #10 combo. The sign in the store clearly states Combos INCLUDE pop or water. The hag there argued with me because my $27 combo didn't include a drink even though it's literally on the menu board in the store! Too bad I'm just another number."}
{"text":"This is probably my worst experience in Swiss Chalet, I used to love their chicken and somehow, today's chicken is very dry!!!  I ordered a piece of Chicken breast, with Baked potato for my daughter (kid's meal), and they gave her a very dry piece of breast that she could hardly chew (she is four now).   For myself , I ordered the classic chicken sandwich. Oh , it's so dull, and again the chicken itself is not juicy at all. I don't know why they don't use fresh veggies. I really hate to eat those Frozen veggies in a restaurant. I expected more please....  Oh well, the service was good, the guy was very friendly, with pleasant smile to us, however, the fly kept bugging me for the whole lunch. ANd it always loves to land on my plate of food!   The drink, my daughter ordered milk, which is pretty ok for her. I ordered an Orange juice, oh well, don't know which brand they were using, and I think they can have a better choice for that, sorry, I don't like it at all."}
{"text":"I'm not surprised this location has such poor reviews. It is literally the worst Swiss Chalet I have ever been to. The worst!  Let's go through the deficiencies:  1. Poor service - We waited about ten minutes at the front for a host to seat us. It was not busy. The problem was no one was checking the front. It took about 15 minutes for our server to take our drink orders (by that time we were ready to order so we did that at the same time). It took about 45 minutes to get our food. Again, they were not busy! Our server never checked in to see how things were. And it took about 20 minutes of us sitting in front of empty plates for our server to finally come over and ask whether we wanted dessert or the cheque.   2. Burnt ribs - The photo of the burnt rib from one of the other reviewers is spot-on. That's what my ribs looked like. Meat? Nope. Charcoal more like. Ribs should not be dry, desiccated and crispy with overall blackened surfaces. WTF are you guys doing to these ribs? Stop it!  3. Crappy wings - We tried their new chicken wings. These must have been pheasant wings. They were so small. And over cooked? You betcha.   4. Dried out coleslaw - I normally love Swiss Chalet coleslaw. I could eat a bucketful. But this stuff was dry, old, and tasteless. How can you ruin Swiss Chalet coleslaw? Seriously, WTF are you guys doing?"}
{"text":"I got take-out from this location a couple days ago. The food is reliably good. Their fries and ribs are so delicious and a gold standard that I compare against other restaurants' fries and ribs (which, sadly, many restaurants fare poorly in the comparison and should be a little ashamed of themselves).   Their coleslaw is also delicious and I have to complain about the ridiculous serving size of the takeout coleslaw. It was a condiment cup that was barely half filled with coleslaw. I was amazed and perplexed. This was actually my first time ordering take-out Swiss Chalet so perhaps it's always been ridiculously small, but that's just unacceptable. Why even give me any coleslaw if you're just going to tease me with one and a half delicious forkfuls.   The only thing I wish Swiss Chalet would change (aside from their ridiculously small portion of take-out coleslaw) is their Chalet sauce. I loathe that stuff. This is why I order ribs rather than chicken. If Swiss Chalet had a good sauce (like the St. Hubert sauce, mmm that stuff was delicious), I'd order the chicken more often."}
{"text":"I go because it convenient but it's a little grunge.  Waitress spilled 4 soda waters on me. She was embarrassed and apologized but the manager made no attempt to come speak to us or comp a meal."}
{"text":"Small establishment with fast service. We got our food very fast and the staff offered refills regularly. Sets a good standard for Swiss Chalet."}
{"text":"Our first experience , ordered the chicken wings and it was delicious! Huge portion , super friendly staff. It's a bit pricey, we ordered the chicken club and the new beef sandwich it was ok . Not our kind of food probably that's why we didn't like it ."}
{"text":"Service was top! 5/5 The waitress was super friendly, attentive and cheerful - more restaurants should have waitresses/waiters with such attitude.  Food was great! 5/5 The chicken was tender and juicy, not dry at all, had a lot of flavour. So was the chicken pie. The ribs were also pretty good."}
{"text":"FOOD It's usually pretty dead at this plaza. Every time we come here to order take out, food doesn't seem to look as fresh as other Swiss chalets we've been to. I wouldn't come back h re again unfortunately because of my past experiences with food. The portions are smaller here as well.   PARKING Plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Swiss Chalet has changed their sauce and that is huge fail for them.   Very disappointed.    This restaurant was clean.   Service was ok.   Not awesome but it was fine.   Food was consistent with what you'd expect except for the Chalet Sauce.   Why change the Chalet Sauce?"}
{"text":"This location is the worst, food quality fails big at this location . I used to order frequently . But it seem the food is horrible dried out most of the time . I stopped ordering from here I have complained to Cara on 2 occasions , but it seems that they don't really care about the customers, that this particular location delivers to . I'm assuming cause its a franchise. This restaurant gives Swiss Chalet a bad name. The manager promised correct the problem, but he's full of it. It seems like they give people dried out day old chicken and get away with it, when you complain the give you half the cost of the meal and actually expect you to order from them again. Beware"}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would, usually I'm not picky about little things but my experience here was completely unproffesional from start to finish. We waited about 10 mins to be seated. At which point we just sat down on our own, not a big deal. We waited 20 mins before someone brought us drinks and as we were waiting we could see at least 4 tables around us obviously angry and looking for servers. Eventually we got our food and 2 orders were wrong, dark chicken instead of white, Not a big deal again just switch it. However here is where I drew the line. Literally every single piece of chicken they brought out to our table wasnt properly cooked. 8 PIECES UNDERCOOKED!there was only 4 of us but we had 2 toddlers. That would be a trip to the hospital for us! And when we pointed it out they tried to say it was the seasoning that made it look pink. Like I've never eaten chicken in my life. Anyways , after all of that we asked for a manager.  It took him 15 mins to come out. When a customer is complaining their food is raw generally you come out asap. But it seemed as if we were inconveniencing them. Never will I ever come back here nor recommend this place. Horrible. It was ok before the renovations but clearly needs some help from head office. I don't ever leave reviews for places but I felt obligated to let people know what they might endure."}
{"text":"Myself and 2 friends arrived at 7 on May 31, 2015. We were dressed fairly trendy, so we expected to get a good looking waiter. My eyebrows were on fleek.   After waiting for 5-10 in the lobby to get seated, we were rethinking our chicken and sauce fest but finally got seated by a female server. Kind of disappointing considering the time I put into my eyebrows.   When she came to take our order, they informed us \"I'm sorry, but we're out of chicken.\"   We looked at each other in disbelief. Could this be possible? This restaurant only sells one thing. Chicken. That's all you eat there. It's like the bird flu finally hit Alberta and all the hens went zombie and clucked down to Saskatchewan.   We left, but not before I put a business card in the bowl to win an imaginary chicken dinner in the future."}
{"text":"This was dirty with filthy, greasy floors. I mentioned to the waitress that they were insects on the wall beside our and she shrugged her shoulders and asked me if I wanted more barbeque sauce. Amazing that the health department for the city of Toronto would allow this filth to exist."}
{"text":"It was one of the driest and most flavorless meals I have had. I had ordered quarter chicken 1/3 rib combo with a fresh vegetable medley which apparently was neither fresh nor flavorful, it was sad looking frozen vegetables that were blanched in tepid water.  The chicken was dry and without any flavor and the ribs were so tasteless that I cannot explain they were barely touched with the bbq sauce.   I will never goto a swiss Chalet ever again."}
{"text":"One of the better SC locations I've been to.  This one is kind of tucked away in the corner of Heartland, right off of Mavis beside a Harry Rosen Outlet store. Surprising, too, because they have a massive dining area, very good atmosphere and great food.The quality of said food is pretty much the same across all of the franchises, so it was uniformly good.  I've been here a couple times and will return. Very solid experience."}
{"text":"I've now been writing intermittently about this Swiss Chalet for two years (and visiting for nearly two decades), and the quality's the worst it's ever been.  This isn't necessarily about the food, but more about the service (or lack thereof). The place is now a zoo during peak hours, with servers and cashiers running around in a daze and either ignoring you or being generally confused as to what's going on. I'm not sure if it's due to the dual format of this place (being that the employees apparently have to know about two brands and be able to make Harvey's hamburgers) or the fact that they just have servers who are woefully unprepared for the constant influx of people, but the end result has suffered.  Every time I visit here, it's now a 50/50 shot as to whether I get my correct order or not. The last time my family and I visited, a young server gave our order to another family (who proceeded to start nibbling at the plate) before bringing it to us a few minutes later and denying that anything was wrong, even though we'd seen it happen with our own eyes. (Thankfully, cooler heads prevailed and they gave us fresh orders.) This time, they forgot simple instructions, even after I'd mentioned it to a server twice and it wasn't even busy.  I think a large part of the problem is the fact that they jettisoned the \"number\" system they previously had before the rebranding, where each table would be given a stand with a number and the servers would know where to bring it to. Now that this system is gone, it's complete guesswork for them, and they have a habit of walking around asking people if they ordered something, which is a mess-and-a-half.  The drink area also seems to be increasingly unkempt each time I visit, which doesn't help matters.  Until they step up their game, I have no choice but to dock marks from this place, which I hate having to do."}
{"text":"I like the chalet sauce, the chicken noodle soup, most of the dishes are good... except for one thing... the low quality chicken. If you step up your chicken quality everyone will notice! Hoping you will."}
{"text":"I've never really been disappointed with the Swiss chalet.  The service was consistent, and the food was good. I often order delivery from that place to my condominium down the street, and the service was fast and efficient. I don't understand some of the other reviews, maybe just a bad night. But I've been there quite often with my family and my coworkers. It is a staple on Queens Quay, especially that we don't have that many restaurants in the area. In my opinion the food is good and the price reasonable. The chicken and the sauce is quite good, and the ribs definitely good."}
{"text":"This place is nice and is hidden at one end of Heartland. Lets get to logistics of the place:  Location: is good as its in heartland so there is no parking problems.  Restaurant: It's quite big and there is plenty of seating with various section and different seats available.   Food: I am not a big fan of Swiss Chalet but it was good. The chicken was soft and tender, and fish was fried well.   Service: was good. We were greeted at the entrance, and seated fast. The server was knowledgeable and friendly.  Price: its easy on the pocket and well priced.  Size: its good for large groups and families  Clean: The restaurant was kept clean and so was the washrooms.  Halal Option: All the Meat is halal except the Ribs and their normal Chicken dipping sauce. Serve did tell us they have a vegetarian dipping sauce and we can switch that with the current sauce.  I confirmed the Halal thing from Zabihah site and then also called the store to confirm. The staff servings us also confirmed that the chicken was halal.  http://www.zabihah.com/d/Mississauga+25436+Swiss-Chalet/   Over all the service was great at this restaurant! We enjoyed our time here."}
{"text":"This place is nice. Lets get to logistics of the place:  Location: is good and is in a plaza with multiple food options and there is no parking problems.  Restaurant: It's quite big and there is plenty of seating with various section and different seats available.   Food: I am not a big fan of Swiss Chalet but it was good. Its what you except.  Service: was good. We were greeted at the entrance, and seated fast. The server was knowledgeable and friendly.  Price: its and average deal.  Size: its good for large groups and families  Clean: The restaurant was kept clean."}
{"text":"I wanted to send some feedback about one bad experience at this particular location.    I wanted to send it by email direct to the company.     Shockingly the chalet doesn't allow you to email them feedback on their website.  (Bad bad bad design)    Hmm.  It made me even more upset to discover this.  Like they just don't care.     Went to this location last night.   Host seated us No service.  For 20 minutes.    We watched in shock and some amusement as they just ignored us.    What's worse is that when we complained they defended and rationalized and STILL dragged their feet.   And never said \"sorry\".   As if we care that the host didn't tell the server.  As if we care that they have an internal debate over which server owns which table.    Then we got even more upset and for a moment we actually argued back....yuck.    We noticed both the server and the host (who was super unprofessional and lazy in this whole matter) telling three manager types of the situation (we assumed these were the manager, the assistant manager and the area regional manager).  They kept looking at us.  And then they made what appeared to be a big \"show of force\" by surrounding the staff in question and almost protecting them.   It was weird.  Like they didn't really want us      And none of them NONE of them even came over to do a check in \" hi. How is everything?\"    THAT was deplorable.   The service that followed was cold and was just plain lazy.   Everything took too long - and they weren't even busy.   The bill came and since there wasn't even a financial acknowledgement (discount) we left no tip and left.    We love the chalet for those quick meals on the run.   And we love this location.  My wife knows the owner of this store (Peter) and we know he would want to know.    Your server on April 15 around 7pm named Vanja and the male host need to go.  Really really bad.   Not just bad service.  Bad attitude.   You can train good service. You can't train good attitude.    It is actually enough to make us find a new location - and we are pretty frequent customers of this location."}
{"text":"My wife, my step-daughter and I were meeting friends from out of town who were attending a girls basketball tournament and staying at the Hilton Garden Inn just around the corner.  Everyone was tired after a long and eventful day out and about...  With kids and family in tow, what at better place to visit than the local Swiss Chalet for dinner?  Our family loves Swiss Chalet because there are choices for everyone, of course there is the tasty chicken and mouth-watering ribs, but there are also choices for those with various food allergies and sensitivities, gluten free, dairy free, and an excellent veggie burger for those who are vegans among us.  The excellent food brings us to Swiss Chalet, but it is the service that brings us back time after time.  Even though the restaurant was full to the rafters with a busy weekend dinner rush, the service was friendly, although it did take a bit of time for the dishes to appear.  We will be back again when we are in the area!"}
{"text":"Ordered spring rolls and there was an entire wishbone in two of them. The first one cut the roof of my mouth. The appetizer ruined the very sloppily and pourly prepared meals, the pre made wrap was barely rolled and had more cartiledge then meat. Let them know in the survey and was offered coupons but never received them or heard anything from them after the initial reply. Update, after leaving this review they contacted me and plan to send me something in the mail to compensate me. 2nd update, had some coupons sent in the mail for pickup and Dine in only when I only order delivery... Not enough to get me to go back"}
{"text":"We are big fans of Swiss Chalet but this was our first visit to this location.  We chose it because we are in the area often and had never been.   To say the visit did not start out well would be an understatement.   When we entered there was no one at the hostess stand nor any staff visible anywhere.   We waited about 10 minutes and still nobody.   I wound up having to walk down to the takeout area (also abandoned)  where I found a bell to ring for service (Does the fact it is there mean that this is a common issue?)   I rang it and a very bored looking woman came out.   I asked if we should just sit anywhere and she yelled out for another staff member who did finally seat us.   We were ordering 1/4 chicken dinners and I was going to order dark meat but the server said that she would recommend the white because the 1/4s were very small, so she would do the white meat without charge for the up size.   The food was good (although even the white meat was smaller than we are used to) and the service was adequate.   We decided to get sundaes for dessert and found out that they were out of whipped cream (this location is directly beside a grocery store... No one could get whipped cream?)  but the server said she would put extra ice cream in lieu.     The server did her best to remedy the situation but the visit left me feeling that this location really doesn't seem to care about the customer experience and would rather understaff and/or under order than have satisfied customers."}

{"text":"the service was horrible we after we placed our order the food came, I am not sure if it was because we were using a coupon the waiter stop attending to us or something she never once came back around to check on our food or a drinks nothing. Once our meals were done she never brought wet naps or anything to clean out hands nothing. She came around to ask if we wanted deserts once we said no she dropped the bill and then never came back. About 10 mins went by I ask to speak the manager even the manager has such an attitude and treated myself and friend with much disrespect with me having an issue with the service. The manager said it's company policy as a customer I to ask for wet naps or napkins to wipe our hands that not longer just give you the stuff to clean your hand's  Long story short don't go to this location if you want a restaurant with good service."}
{"text":"Very poor experiences at this location. Take out staff are anything but friendly. I often end up waiting up to 10 minutes just to get greeted. I recently ordered a 1/4 chicken meal and the chicken was very dry, I ended up giving it to my dog. Won't visit again."}
{"text":"Had a meal with my brother, his wife and kids, and my children.  Service was slow, and as we sat at the table, I felt something on my head.  The server literally dumped a melting ice cream dessert over my head, down my back and all over my jacket as she made her way to the kitchen.  When I confronted her as to why there was no bill adjustment, she handed me a coupon for a dark quarter chicken meal, if another meal of greater value was purchased.  After factoring in the cost of cleaning my jacket, the humiliation of wearing someone's left over dessert?  Wish I had never set foot in the restaurant, and never have again.  Plenty of other places to eat that would at least buy your dinner if the server had you wear someone else's.  I wasn't asking for the entire table's dinner for free (I was treating my brother's family and paying the tab), but how awkward is it to wear ice cream home, in your hair as well, and try and not get it on your car seat?  The message is \"Please come back to be splattered by melted ice cream again, but NEXT TIME one dinner is free if two people come?\"  Epic fail."}
{"text":"As a person who literally became part of a movement to get a Swiss Chalet in Grande Prairie when I lived there, I can honestly say the standards have dropped.    When I first started ordering from Swiss Chalet in Airdrie, the standards were quite high, even though in the 5 years since I had eaten it before, the food quality had dropped significantly.  In fairness, I always have done take out from this location.  The unfortunate nature of the open window is hearing the trash talk in the kitchen.  It doesn't burn my ears to hear what the kitchen staff thinks of this order, or that, but I do prefer my 12-year-old son not hear it.  I wish it had only been on one pick up order that I wanted him to \"ear muff it\".   I also didn't realize that Swiss Chalet no longer did rotisserie chicken, and had decided to now do rotisserie sparrows.  I can get a way better value to buy a rotisserie chicken at any local grocery store, and either stop in to buy sauce, or buy the Swiss Chalet packaged sauce at Safeway.  We got used to doing \"fakey Chalet\" when there was no Swiss Chalet to go to.  And now?  I have realized that doing fakey Chalet tastes just as good, and is a WAY better value than the real thing now.  I hate to sound like an ancient person who says \"Back when I was a kid\", but even back when I was in my mid-late 20's, Swiss Chalet offered value for your dollar.  The astronomical price raise (especially for delivery, check out the difference in THOSE prices!!!), combined with a disappointing decline in product quality?    Not a place I spend my money any longer..."}
{"text":"Worst waitrwss ever. Had to ask for butter for our bread, as well as the chicken sauce. She left our table in the middle of taking our order.  She ledt my daughters empty plates on the table during dessert and then when she gave us the bill she announced to the room how much the bill was as well as how much the tip would be. Horrible."}
{"text":"I will rate this Swiss Chalet location 5 Stars. I have ordered delivery from them many times and the delivery people are all so friendly and polite. I ordered it just tonight and when I went to pay at the door my bank card was having issues going through, the delivery man let me have the food still and told me he would come back and pick up the money tomorrow. He was very patient as I tried my card multiple times and was very polite. I am so happy with the customer service at this location. If anyone knows the driver who goes by \"Sam\" please give him a raise or something, What a kind fellow. He reminded me a lot of my italian grandpa who passed away a few years ago. This location is awesome, never had a single problem with them ever. Thanks so much, and keep up the great work with the staff there!! I highly recommend this particular location."}
{"text":"Was here at Swiss chalet for dinner maybe couple weeks back. Didn't like how we weren't greeted right away when one of the staff walked by the front door. Even though it was a weekday, they were way understaff. I felt bad for our server because she was so nice yet she was just super slow since she had other tables to juggle with. She did apologize for the wait but it was so long that we almost walked out.   Taste of food was the usual standard that you'll get since it's a franchise. My party all ordered quarter chicken dinner (can't go wrong with that). The price of food went up which I don't really think it's worth that much. Maybe that's why, I barely ever come to Swiss Chalet as overall I think there's other better rotisserie chicken places out there. The only thing I really enjoyed was there unique chalet sauce. It is a must with the chicken!  To sum up my two stars, one is for the server's sweetness and the other is for the chalet sauce. If you're craving Swiss chalet, I wouldn't recommend to come to this location. I've tried other locations and they're better unless you have all the time in the world to wait and relax."}
{"text":"Okay. The only thing I buy at Swiss Chalet are wings and they are great wings. I love their Medium sauce and been a fan of their wings for a long time now.  However, when you buy their wings you have to get extra sauce.   Management of Swiss chalet.... for the love of god add \"extra sauce\" option to on-line orders.  If i make an on-line order. I have to call in and  ask for more sauces because amount of sauce you guys use has been pitiful lately. I don't mind paying extra for that sauce but give me that option."}
{"text":"From the outside Swiss Chalet looks like a regular chain with cheap, low grade, average food. However, in this case, judging a book by the cover isn't the right thing to do. Even though food here has value it's actually better than average food. The chicken tastes similar to many of the fancier restaurants in the GTA, it just comes with a napkin and on a regular white plate instead of a fancy dish.   This particular location brings wonderful service with quality chicken at an affordable price. Whether in the mood for a chicken wrap, chicken salad or breast, you'll find yourself at home here. All items are freshly cooked, not heated up and while the vegetables tasted canned and frozen, if you stick to the chicken you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Their slogan, \"always so good for so little\" fits the bill. It's not expensive, and honestly, everyone likes Swiss Chalet. This location has some very young, sweet waitresses, but surprisingly I never had them mess up anything. Whenever I've arrived, it seemed very quiet.  I've done their drive through and I can't understand how they are ready for our order so quickly and efficiently - every time.  I wish I had a non-burnt wing more often, but can't win them all."}
{"text":"Don't know if the Chalet needs a review..  but yea this location has had some fantastic service and some so-so service.  The food is consistent.  It's a classic, always good for lunch or dinner.  And they have the BEST fries!"}
{"text":"So true World's slowest Swiss Chalet. They orders are never correct or on time. small portions and overpriced. .. Then food some times looks like it's been tossed around looks more like a jail meal and it's even a insult for the jail food.."}
{"text":"Now I remember why I don't come to this location.   Came here for dinner tonight just before 8pm (Thursday night). From the moment we sat down to the moment I put food in my mouth....it took about 40-45 minutes. Pretty ridiculous. Why did I stay? Cuz it was already getting late and I was hungry   There were probably 4 waitresses and about 5 tables being served including us sooooo the lack of service wasn't because it was busy. I can only imagine what it would be like when it is!   However chicken was cooked well and was still hot. Shrimp was also cooked well and had great flavour! The ribs....not so much. They were quite dry and it seemed like they tried covering it up by adding lots of BBQ sauce.   Not too impressed. Probably won't come here again unless I had to."}
{"text":"It had been years since I had eaten at Swiss Chalet. I was hungry and tired and they were handy. It was about 4:00 pm when i walked in so as expected it was quiet, but it seemed there was a lot of staff around. I stood at the front and seemed to be ignored for a bit. I eventually was seated and served. My server was pleasant and my order arrived fairly quickly and I ate most of it and felt satisfied. The fries and dipping sauce were as yummy as I remembered. Their prices seem a bit high for almost fast food but at least it was good. The ambience was pleasant and clean. If their prices were a wee bit better then they would deserve 4 stars but i will call this a 3.5."}
{"text":"Ya, I enjoy Swiss Chalet, but after *4* wrong delivery orders IN A ROW, it's time to say goodbye.  Bye.   (Note - revised the next day after receiving an email from the manager saying there was already a credit for a 1/4 chicken dinner, so I should get that.  I replied back by asking how many times in a row they would put up.'    I'll let you know if / when they answer."}
{"text":"Awful service and the meat was raw. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"I have been here twice. Once to grab togo. The takeout counter sometimes had no one there... And I had to go to the back to find an employee.  The other time I ate in.. it was very busy.. took 20 mins before someone came to take our order.. would not suggest going here when it's busy... Wait times can be long.. The food itself seemed fine and good."}
{"text":"Came in to this location with my girlfriend on a Saturday. Seating and waiting for food was pretty fast, however the staff were fairly often unresponsive. All this considered, this is still the best location around this area, as far as Swiss Chalet's go."}
{"text":"Had to stop in for dinner since I arrived about four hours before my flight time to accommodate my coworkers flight schedule. I was under the impression that the Toronto airport would have a lot to offer even in Terminal 3, since its so large. I was wrong about that. Luckily the Swiss Chalet was an option.  My server was friendly. And they have beer on tap. Those are the only reasons that this one pulled two stars rather than one. For those in the Twin Cities, imagine Perkins with fewer menu options, lower food quality, an inferior dining environment  and you'll get an idea of what to expect. I chose the chicken wrap. It was made with canned chicken and served with a side of thousand island salad dressing. OMG. Guess it worked out ok because i survived to write about it. You'll pay $10 for a glass of Rickard's Red, and that is a crime. I found it interesting that they provide a small dish of warm water to rinse your fingers at the end of the meal. Is that a Swiss tradition? Someone fill me in.   Among the limited choices in Terminal 3 this one is probably one of the best but that's not saying much.  Is your flight departing from Terminal 3? Take my advice. Eat before you get to the airport."}
{"text":"I visited this Swiss chalet to take my mother out for lunch today. The service was great, and the food was standard to any Swiss chalet.   I was very disappointed at the manager, whose name I found out is Vera (sp?). There was a young girl who came in and ordered take out. She clearly wanted to eat some of her food in the restaurant after paying, so she sat down to do so. The restaurant was completely empty other than maybe 2 other tables. The restaurant manager, Vera, came up to the young girls table and told her that since she ordered take out, she is not allowed to sit down and she needs to leave. The girl asked if she could have a bowl/plate to dine in for the portion of food she wanted to eat inside, and the manager said no. She told her next time, she needs to dine in. She was so rude and made this customer feel completely unwelcome (in an already empty restaurant, probably not what you want to do).  I approached Vera after and asked about this, she said it was \"policy\". She ended up telling me that I'm not the girls lawyer, and yelling and screaming in the back kitchen area, so we decided to get our bill and leave. I would never go back to this location after seeing how this nice young girl was treated by the manager, and then how she handled my questioning this \"policy\"."}
{"text":"For restaurant chains, I won't discuss the food as much since everyone knows what to expect but will focus on service and quality in this review instead.   First, we received a friendly greeting when we arrived and was promptly seated at a booth table.  FYI, we ordered the 2 can dine quarter chicken deal. Yay for coupons!   Our waiter was extremely quick in providing our drinks and food and was pleasant enough. We also didn't feel rushed. Some chains tend to push you to get out the door as soon as the  wait staff starts to swing by more often in hopes of providing you the bill as you set an Olympic record for clearing your plate! But our guy was great and seemed to have a good sense of who was there to enjoy a meal with good company and those who wanted a quick bite before heading off to do another activity.   Overall, I'm very happy with the experience/service and the food was delicious. We would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"This Swiss Chalet has always delivered good food, hot, fresh and it's always dependent on the location I find but this one is great. The young girl who seats us is always friendly and pleasant and the waiters/waitresses are very polite!   Pizza is an option on the kids menu only and yes they offer a variety of sides with the main dish which is good in my opinion.   They have a variety of delicious menu items and I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I went here on Monday, the place wasn't busy. The service was terrible though, my chicken was smaller than the kids meal quarter chicken. My mothers chicken was ice cold, I was going to just order but I figured eating in would be better since something is usually screwed up with my order. Real bad experience on Monday and it's a shame cause I love Swiss chalet but now I have to find an alternative. Better off buying a whole cooked chicken at walmart and a can of dipping sauce. Done with this place."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about Swiss Chalet fries, but, they are the next best thing to Micky D's (in my opinion:p) My bf and I felt like something casual after a late-night movie and funnily enough, we both had a craving for Swiss Chalet. There is one fairly close to my home which is this Swiss Chalet location; it's situated in a small outdoor mall complex with a Valu-mart, CIBC bank and Harvey's...nothing fancy.  Intro. For those of you who frequent this location, but have not been since last Christmas (2010), this restaurant has had a complete over-haul of its design. It's now much more sleek and modern. We both entered and there were a lot of oohh's and aahh's - they even have a bar area?!?! This Swiss Chalet is definitely for the adults.  Food. I don't think you can ever go amiss with Swiss Chalet food - which is almost fast-food-standardized, but with sit-down service. We went there pretty late so our fries were freshly fried (crispy and yummy) and the chicken was tender. My bf also had the rib combo, which was equally fall-of-the-bone.   Service was nice and efficient.  All in all, if you are ever in the Baview and Shep-ish area, and you want to have something casual, but guaranteed yum, then this Swiss Chalet location won't disappoint. And as a bonus, for those who love booth-seating (such as moi), then this restaurant has TONS of booths - this means that guaranteed, you will always have a just little bit of privacy in an otherwise very busy world. (Philosophical Moment...only when I have chicken and fries!)"}
{"text":"Growing up, my parents would always bring home Swiss Chalet for take-out and I used to LOVE it. Being in the actual restaurant itself gave me a different vibe, the food just didn't taste as good?!  The service was on par - the waitress who served us was genuinely kind & patient when taking our orders. She was also consistent with refilling our cups (we hella thirsty). At the time, they ran out of dark meat chicken & substituted it for white meat for the same price (white meat: slightly more expensive).   Food itself was mediocre at best. The rice pilaf was undercooked and took me a while to chew before I could barely swallow the dryness - maybe that's why the waitress kept refilling water for us LOLZ. Not to mention, in comparison to how much they give in their take-out containers, the portion of the rice on the plate was... give or take 3-4 spoonfuls. The white meat chicken was a little undercooked yet still super dry and tough as well."}
{"text":"I can still remember the days of going to Swiss Chalet as a young child and adult and looking forward to a great meal. I do believe those days are long gone.   I recently visited the Ajax location on Bayly. I ordered my food thru the take out. The chicken breast was small and so was the quarter chicken. The romaine lettuce was limp. Smaller combo containers so they can reduce waste I'm sure....but also reducing portions and quality. Sauce as always..good.  Fries reduced in size.   Best advice... Costco whole chicken $10.00 Chalet sauce $1.69  Fries $3.99 Head of Lettuce $1.99 Caesar dressing $2.99 Superstore/Sobeys  Please see pics for my quarter combo, Caesar Chicken salad with side of fries. $32.00. It is a sad day for Swiss Chalet fans folks.   So Cara was good enough to give me a free 1/4\" Caesar salad next time I was in after reading my Yelp review. I showed the girl at reception about the free Chicken Caesar salad in the email. When I got home she gave me a 1/4\" dinner with Caesar salad. Wrong meal. Hahah. #thanksfortryingswisschalet"}
{"text":"It's pretty good food I have been going location for years I'm pretty satisfied with their service and planning to go there today as well"}
{"text":"The best Swiss Chalet period.   Nobody loves Swiss chalet more than me.  I usually come to this location at least once a week.   Food is always piping hot, excellent service  (Enza is the best)  and quick.    See you on Friday"}
{"text":"It is a chain so you expect them to be consistent and they are, same tiny chickens as all the other Swiss Chalet locations.  I swear they must barely let them hatch before they are sent to be slaughtered.  I have had wing drumettes larger than some of their chicken legs. The last time we went was for their Festive Special before Christmas.  They must save the really tiny chickens for those specials.  The food is good, but don't expect to get full on just the chicken, although they do give you a ton of fries if you get them for a side.  On the other hand, they have tiny baked potatoes so stick with the fries. The service is fine, but it can be hard to find a spot in the tiny lot they share with several other businesses and restaurants.  I only go when we have a coupon or they have a special since the chicken is just too small for the price."}
{"text":"They've updated the place and it's a lot better now.  Food is still the same (but good).  I'd go back there now that they've updated it.  Below is my old review ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The food and the service are \"fine\", basically what you've come to expect from a Swiss Chalet.   The issue is that the tables are STICKY. I've been told on multiple occasions that it's because of the varnish or coating ontop of them - it needs to be redone.  Because of this,  I usually go to the one in The Kingsway, just east of Royal York and Bloor...."}
{"text":"Eaten here many times. In store dining is acceptable. Prices are a titch high for me, and I'd personally like my chicken cooked a little more. Avoid take out or delivery for this location. They have never gotten our order correct. Not even once."}
{"text":"Prompt service and goof food. We order from there a lot but the odd time they'll forget an item. I really like their delivery drivers they're very fast and friendly"}
{"text":"Poor form. Ordering from Swiss Chalet for takeout many times before, I know it takes them less than 10 minutes to pull an order together, sometimes 5! Which is what I love about them. I stop by at a quarter to 10 to pick up my dinner and the staff member rushes to the door to lock it before I can even get to the door. Wow! Poor form indeed. This was just this night."}
{"text":"I grew up with Swiss Chalet.  Perhaps I'm stuck in the era where our parents' generation keeps reminding us of how going to the movies used to cost 25 cents.  So maybe its unfair to give the following comment, but having given hundreds of dollars (if not thousands) to Swiss Chalet for over 15 years, I am constantly disappointed of the shrinking chickens and increased price.  I know I know, inflation... sigh.  That being said, 3 stars was NOT for the above.  The restaurant itself is not bad.  We were greeted by three hostesses/waitresses that didn't have a single smile on their face, but at least when we arrived to our table there was a cheerful girl that served us.  I mean, it's only Swiss Chalet... right?  Nothing spectacular with this place.  Location is convenient as its off the highway.  Taste is consistent.  Fries are always delicious.  If Swiss Chalet is what you want, this place works just as all the other ones around town!"}
{"text":"Was on a desperate mission for some quick and easy food when we spotted this location. It was less than an hour before closing but we were welcomed and not made to feel as if we needed to rush through our meal. Our server was wonderful...I've never seen anyone balance a fully loaded tray on each arm before. I'm sorry that I can't remember her name because really good service should be recognized and there are many upscale restaurants that could learn a thing or two from this lady. I'm not big on French fries but the fries at this location were amazing...they tasted like real potato, crispy and not overcooked. The coffee was hot and delicious...and despite the late hour there were many refills.  Won't hesitate to return."}
{"text":"Swiss Chalet is one of my favourite restaurants (I'm fancy, you know). Delicious, home style, and quality food in a comfortable and affordable setting. After an early morning out and about, we stopped at this Swiss Chalet for a late lunch. We were seated quickly, though they only had one \"regular\" booth available. We got a \"half-round\" booth (for 3 of us), which was okay, but I'm still a regular booth kind of gal. Our server was friendly, and the food was good - just what you'd expect from a local Swiss Chalet. While this isn't my favourite location, it doesn't have any big downsides, and I'll probably visit again."}
{"text":"My last 5 experiences (ranging over the course of a couple years) have been less-than-stellar.  I used to love Swiss Chalet, but they're slipping, particularly this location.  The chicken is sub-bar, portions are small, and their dessert (my favourite: apple crisp) is a complete joke.  I've given them plenty of chances to change my mind (5 times!) and now I don't bother trying anymore.  There are better places to eat in Newmarket.  This is not one of them."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this restaurant for about 6 years after moving into the area, and the service has always been a bit spotty.  That said, they always make up for any mistakes and take ownership of any issues.  So we're quite happy to eat here.  The food, for the most part, is good.  What you'd expect from a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Very poor service from the waitress, also there  is no point of making a reservation since they won't remember what food you want to eat.  I will never go back to that location."}
{"text":"Last weekend I ordered my family food from the store and we had to wait an hour and a half for it to be delivered and when it arrived at my home we had to microwave the food to make it edible. The fries were not cooked and they were hard, and they didn't even ship the dessert that was supposed to come with my sons kids meal.  We have ordered from this store several times and the food is never arriving hot."}
{"text":"It was no fault of yours that I had the most panic stricken night since I moved to this active city. Maybe it was your delicious sauce that was of a perfect viscosity and flavor. Maybe it was the better than ever fries that graced my plate, or maybe it was the spectacular grouping of friends with whom I attended this establishment. But whatever it was, I almost died. And I don't mean died in the very proverbial sense, I mean the real \"hands over throat Heimlich needing\" (more commonly known \"j thrust\") kind of died.   No thanks to your delicious food however my friends didn't even notice. All of this is not your fault, and I must give you props for putting on such a great party that I almost expired. So four fabulous stars or your \"expert combination of chicken, sauce, and fries\" (-Adeel O on his first experience of Swiss Chalet). However my veggie burger was standard, if not a little dry (hence said choking). So it was really the adventure that will stay in my mind rather than the entrees. Thanks for making it such a memorable evening.   Bottom line...eaters beware, one must follow my life motto while in this eatery, \"pay attention, pay pay attention!\". Also always choose sauce over no sauce."}
{"text":"Thank goodness it was dark in there, well lit and this dirty little stop might have been horror movie ready. Along with the bad lighting this was the least franchise-like location I have seen. While decor is not highly important to the eating experience, when it actually detracts from the experience I have an issue. This Swiss Chalet was less chalet and more axe murderer hideout, filled with large amounts of dollar store paraphernalia which both collected dust, and took up valuable space.   As far as food went it was your standard sauce and fries, I tried the new fishthey are offering and it was alright. Tartar sauce was a relishy mess tasting more like sweet and sour sauce than said tartar, and if I was you I would just leave the tiny coleslaw in its tiny cup as it was pretty bland.   Bottom line...I love chalet sauce, but this restaurant made it turn in my stomach, bring your wet wipes if you dare."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love rotisserie chicken? It's simple, comfortable and full of flavour. I've never had a bad meal here, it's always delicious, quick and flavorful.   Where it lost points with me if the actual portion size of the quarter chicken leg. They are half the size they used to be. They can fit in the palm of your hand. Portion has gone down and price has gone up.   Staff are for the majority great, a few bad apples but nothing you can't find anywhere else."}
{"text":"I don't know why this locations food isn't up to par quality wise with the other location on eglinton and hwy10. I always order from the eglinton location and my meal seems clean and tastes fresh however my experience with SC at heartland was the complete opposite, the chicken was gamey and the chicken skin was sticky. I know for a fact there's something done differently at this location and I will not be returning my last visit almost deferred me from the franchise itself. There's also a weird stale odour in the sitting area and it was so prominent i had to ask to be seated elsewhere. That's when I saw a server sitting in the booth across from me playing on her cell phone with headphones on while another server kept coming to her at least 7-8 times to ask her to get back to work, quite entertaining to watch while we were eating."}
{"text":"When I have a craving for rotisserie chicken, Swiss Chalet is the place to go to and this location never disappoints.  Food:  -Double leg dinner (Dark meat) with a side of Caesar salad or fries. The chicken is usually moist and it's pretty consistent every time. However, sometimes they serve legs that are drier. I love how the Swiss Chalet fries taste and I like to dip the chicken and fries in their chalet sauce.  Sometimes, the Caesar salad has too much dressing while at other times it has too little dressing. Overall, the food is at par.  Service:  Here is why this location never disappoints me is because of the service. In particular with the server named Denny. If you are hungry, sitting in Denny's section is the place to be.  He really cares about his customers. Here is why I say that: when I wanted to use a coupon on the coupon sheet upon ordering, he told me that another coupon that I was holding would be of more value. During the ordering process, I was surprised that he listed all the side choices so I didn't have to look at the menu. While I was eating, I finished drinking my water and without asking him, he gave me another glass of water. With this service by Denny, you will be in good hands.  The food is pretty consistent at this location and next time, I am going to request to sit at Denny's section"}
{"text":"Went for dinner.  Stood there for 10+ minutes with not a single hello, no hostess, no notice to staff from pick up counter to other staff that someone was waiting to be seated. Nada, crickets.   We could see they were congregated in the kitchen some eating, some stacking dishes, they looked at us and ignored us. Each one of them.    When I asked if there was a manager on duty the pick up window said yes and was polite about it.  My husband counted at least 8 staff and when he went to the back to get someone's attention a young woman came out and said . \"We don't have a hostess this evening\".   No, \"sorry to keep you waiting\", no apology Ir reautiinnif any kind.   We said how long we had been waiting and that's when she threw us a snooty look and continued with excuses instead of \"let me get you someone, sit where ever you want I'll send someone right over,..\". She just disappeared back into the kitchen again with us having no idea if we were going to be seated or not.  So we left.   Don't waste your time going there.  Pick another place."}
{"text":"Great place fantastic food really good size portions friendly  staff fast service very clean place washroom was spotless."}
{"text":"This is the second time that I have visited this particular location.  After such a bad experience the last time, I was very hesitant to go back but it was close to where we were at the time.   The first time our waitress was on the border of being rude to us, so already we were not off to a good start with our experience.  My coffee was not drinkable, it was absolutely terrible.  I ordered the quarter chicken and when it arrived it was completely over cooked and dried up. The person I was with me ordered the beef kaiser sandwich and meat was completely flavorless, bland doesn't even describe it, the meat was grey.   The second time, our waitress took 20 minutes to come to our table to ask if we wanted a beverage. It then took her another 15 minutes to come with the two waters. Before any of our food arrived our waitress gave us a bill, which wasn't even for our table!   We ordered an appetizer of spring rolls and that arrived WITH our main courses. She also forgot the separate dip that we ordered on the side.  I had the quarter chicken with salad and it was good. The person I was with ordered the crispy chicken which was also good. The food this time around is why I gave this location a generous 2 stars, otherwise my review would have reflected even worse. I  So to summarize again, the first time our food was not good and the waitress was rude. This time the waitress was basically nonexistent, and when she was there she was unfriendly. The food was fine the second time, but because of the extremely poor service, getting someone else's bill before our food arrived, we both decided that we would never ever under any circumstance ever come back.  After our first bad experience we did complain to the manager after we paid for our bill. But because of the consistently bad service and inconsistent food we would not go back to this Swiss Chalet location.  We are very good Swiss Chalet customers in our hometown, but this location needs completely new servers who care about the quality of customer service that they are giving, better management, and better quality control in the kitchen.  Extremely disappointed customers. We do not recommend this location."}
{"text":"Super slow service and it wasn't even busy. The server never came back to check on us until we had to get up and find her to get the bill.   Tried the honey garlic new combo, food was ok, but the portion of our one of our quarter chickens was very small compared to other times at Swiss chalet.   Don't think I will return to this locations"}
{"text":"The food and service is nothing special, but it is acceptable at the price point. The ribs are hit and miss, but the chicken dishes are usually acceptable. I usually order a half chicken with fries, but will sometimes go for the ribs or one of their specials."}
{"text":"This is a clean and spacious restaurant. We went New Years Day 2015. The waitress was nice and friendly but very slow with the service considering it was not busy at all. I ordered a strawberry dacquiri and after 10 minutes she came back to tell me they had no strawberries and would I take a lime margurita instead. I agreed although I wonder why they didn't have at least frozen strawberries to make the dacquiri. Another 10 minutes went by and she came back to tell me they didn't have basmati rice for the chicken teriyaki. Sigh like wtf? It's on the menu so why don't they have it? I took white rice as a substitute but I shouldn't have had to.  The food was delicious and made up somewhat for the non available items and slow service although I won't return to this location"}
{"text":"I was there Rememebrance Day  on Wednesday  night and amazing service they even put the hockey game for me on to watch and sat us in a booth near the bar. Wish I knew the name of the server ."}
{"text":"Went with family and children and a teenager to this location after a soccer game. We were seated quickly, pleasant server who answered all questions for kids and me (I am vegetarian). Drinks were refilled quickly, food came out quickly, and over all this restaurant offers good value.  The customer service was very good for a busy place like this at dinner time. Woukd definitely return."}
{"text":"By the WORST ONGOING customer service that we have ever experienced, anywhere!!  I can't tell how many times the staff have messed up simple basic orders. In the past delivery has been very slow and the in-house dining experience horrendous. The last straw was a pickup order that left our heads spinning. My wife and I were very tired after along day at work recently and took a \"chance\" that 2 festive chicken dinners would go down without a major skirmish breaking out.  This location is convenient because it is near our house in North Toronto but we have in the past gone out of our way to drive to another store because we've had such bad service here! So the order was placed with the Cara call center with specific instructions ensuring that they double check the order (for being hot)  and correctly assembled as billed. Wouldn't you know it - the order was completely wrong! Ordering from this location ensures food presented to you is cold and not evenly remotely fresh. Complaining to \"Matt\" the store manager is useless as he expects his customers to \"inspect the food at the counter\" before you drive away!! Extremely rude and condescending to my wide on the phone. Nice! They offered a Super rush delivery to make up for another error.  The super rush delivery took over an hour and 15 minutes as the makeup order wasn't punched into the POS machine until 23 minutes after I had spoken to the store! This is how much Cara Upper management cares as they don't even bother to follow-up on customer complaints either?? Very rude service from all levels of staff right up to the top. Avoid this location at all costs!! Even considering boycotting CARA foods altogether. The power is in the wallet and my money will be better spent at other food more reputable food establishments!"}
{"text":"Why go to a place where everything you eat can literally be made at home,  even the sauce can be bought in stores.  Take your kid for 1 adventure perhaps but never go back. Grease on a plate,  no thanks."}
{"text":"Convenient to the highway. Unclean bathroom but friendly wait staff. Food was enjoyable but all we ordered were appetizers at our short stay. $18 for 2 appetizers and an iced tea so not a great value but our waitress was friendly and the location was right. It feels like a Perkins or Denny's in the US. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here but if you need to stop in, you'll leave with a full belly."}
{"text":"Great food. Whenever my mom comes to visit me we always go here. they are fast and the food is always so good!"}
{"text":"Been here several times before. Not my favourite Swiss Chalet but it's closest to my house. Had to persuade my husband to come here this evening because I wanted comfort food, served quickly.   I should have really just drove the extra 3kms....,  Horribly slow service, empty restaurant. Got my order wrong, then argued with me that she gave me what I ordered.... Sent the new order through. Came back 10 minutes later to ask what sides I wanted!   Still sitting here hungry. Everyone else at the table is done eating.   Won't EVER be back."}
{"text":"Wow, I know take out from Swiss chalet was always bad over the years.. now I come to this location to dine in for the second time in three years and what a disappointment. Avoid the shrimp and chicken or should I say butter and chicken and rice. I love butter but this meal required a straw"}
{"text":"I visited this location on a rainy Wednesday around 8pm in July. The place was only about one third full. When you first go inside you can see that the interior is made up of dark wood work with white rectangular inserts in the walls, which seems plain to me. Our waiter, Jin was very attentive to us and followed our requests precisely. I found it odd that he left butter on the table but none of us had dinner rolls with our dishes (such as pasta and sandwiches). I decided not to order one of their individual chicken dinner meals because I find them small. I usually order the rotisserie chicken family pack for take-out. I went with a $10.99 classic burger without lettuce. The wait time wasn't long and the portions of the burger with fries was pretty good. The burger was nicely cooked and delicious. It was mostly average compared to other restaurant burgers, but the only difference was that our waiter brought me some gravy and a pack of mustard and relish on the side. It made the meal more enjoyable, especially with the fries being fresh. The meal was also very filling. The only thing I noticed at the end of the meal was a fruit fly buzzing around and I hate fruit flies. The service was good, although our waiter could have used a smile. I had also asked for a glass of water without ice and it had that strong tap water taste to it, but it didn't cost me anything so I can't complain."}
{"text":"There is a saying that sometimes even if you don't remember what someone said, you may remember how they made you feel. Our evening was like that at this Swiss Chalet. After dining for over 2 hours I left feeling happy, contented and satisfied. There's something about all that retro decor, the browns and beiges, along with the pictures of fruit and veggies on the wall that spells comfort food from the past. The restaurant was obviously understaffed and our mature server told us that she had to prepare our drinks herself. It's nice to have a server level with you in these situations and we all agreed that the extra wait time made us happier once we were served (there was an audible cheer from us whenever she arrived at our table). Bonus points go to her for mixing me the best caesar cocktails I've had in recent memory. Our food was fine with no disappointments. I had both the chicken and ribs and enjoyed the dry ribs: nice and tender. We were well taken care of and even got the little bowl of hot water with lemon for cleaning your fingers at the end of the meal. We found parking on Huntley St. just west of the restaurant which was free after 9 pm."}
{"text":"Never again we threw everything in the garbage. The food was truly awful. Should have taken more notice of other reviews"}
{"text":"The service was aweful. Once we sit down beside the window, the waitress DISAPPEARED! We find the menus, filled the water all by walking to the waitress! Plus she did not even asked for the choices of the side and bread and so on. And of course give my friend a white bread instead of brown. The rib rack tastes good. Chicken was not...... I'm still in shock with the service experience."}
{"text":"The worst place to eat. Servers tried , but we're overrun  by all the returns and complaints. Examples:cold food (including soup)                   Dry overcooked chicken                   Plate with incorrect items                  Charged for undelivered drinks Overall the worst Chalet in T.O.  Save yourselves ,don't be fooled by their ads &specials ."}
{"text":"This seems to be the nicest Swiss Chalet we have been to. The service was very good, our server was polite, caring and and happily willing to make any changes we wanted!!! The food was above average for Swiss Chalet!! The butter chicken dipping sauce actually tasted like butter chicken!!!  The spinach salad looked better than the quarter chicken dinner!"}
{"text":"3 hrs wait for delivery which was cold and half of it was wrong. Worst manager of a restaurant I've ever spoken to. Never thought I would ever say this but I'm so offended by the service I will never eat Swiss chalet again."}
{"text":"I've found that most Swiss Chalets have been very consistent, so when it comes to yelping (is that a verb yet?) the franchise it's really more about the service.  That being said, the service of this location is great. The servers are attentive: knew when we'd want to order, came around to refill our glasses often, and cleaned off the table without us feeling rushed. The restaurant is clean, and the food came out hot and quick. Kudos to the ladies serving today, they made it a very good experience.   The food itself was consistent (which is why I like Swiss Chalet, no surprises, you know what you're going to get). We ordered the chicken spring rolls as an appetizer, they came out crispy and light (not greasy at all, hard to find). I would recommend it.   For the mains, we ordered the quarter chicken dinner (dark meat) and the chicken pot pie. The quarter chicken was moist and well seasoned, it comes with Chalet sauce a delicious added bonus. The pot pie was consistent as well, the only constructive criticism is the top. It seems to vary from location to location, some places have a puff pastry, this place had a cracker like consistency that kind of just slid right off the pie. It's a preference thing I guess.  When normal people are full, they stop eating. Not us, we finished our meal off with a pecan pie. We got a generous slice with powdered sugar and a drizzle of caramel. Delicious.   I would highly recommend this location. Good food and great service."}
{"text":"LOML and I head to Toronto a few times yearly to see the kids and Swiss Chalet is always in the mix. Why this chain has not succeeded in the greatest country in the world is beyond me. They lasted a few years in Buffalo and Rochester and...well...their gone.   Chicken and fries are the rave at SC and there is no compare.The BBQ sauce is peppery and you get yourself a little bowl of hot water and lemon for clean up.  Grab a beer or wine, top it off with any of their desserts and you're good to go. Wait staff at this location are awesome but not always the case at other SC's. This place is consistently good and inexpensive."}
{"text":"Not sure what has happened to this location but it's going down hill fast. My order was delivery & was poorly packaged. My chalet sauce was upside down. Food has become subpar. Dry chicken. The perogies are usually a fav of mine but these were horrible. Food was luke warm at best. Every time we order from this restaurant the food gets worse and worse. I now avoid it like the plague. The Harvey's attached is heading in the same direction."}
{"text":"Try another location. This one is a disaster. Horribly slow. Waited an hour for a quarter dinner. Fries were in a cluster. Dressing was off. Stay away."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I usually LOVE Swiss chalet, however this was my first time in this location and it was AWFUL! so it started off okay the waitress took our orders and delivered the drinks and app fairly fast, however when it came time to deliver the food she set it down on the table didn't clear anything else off and that was the last time She came to our table until it was time to pay. Now our drinks were pretty much finished when she delivered our food and never offered to refill them, never asked how the food was which was practically inedible due to the chicken being so dry and having no liquids to help digest it, she would go to the table next to us and turn (we were in a corner booth) with her back to us at all times so we couldn't get her attention. Finally after finishing -ish our meals we had to find the waitress ask for a box, the cheque and a refill, when she came back to the table reached over an empty glass to refill ONE persons beverage and dropped the box on the table so we could put the leftovers in it ourselves. The icing on the cake however is though she didnt come to our table once during the whole meal as soon as she saw the money come out, she was right over to the table FINALLY getting a plate out of the way and then she held out her hand and asked us to put all the money in her hand for her. This was the most ridiculous trip to a restaurant I have had in a long time!!"}
{"text":"I was pretty happy with the customer service at this Swiss Chalet. The server was very attentive, considering it was a Friday night.  Food was quick, and delicious :)  They have some new things on the menu that look good (Chicken Parm), but I stuck to the classic  FYI sign up for their newsletter on their site and get a free app :)"}
{"text":"The food court here is pretty busy as you would expect during the lunchtime rush.  It's in the middle of the financial district, in the First Canadian Place building.  I had the Thursday lunch special: half a chicken wrap, soup, and salad for $8.    I noticed the wrap was pre-wrapped!  The only thing they did was throw it on the grill to create the grill marks.  Not impressed.  It can't possibly tack on that much additional time to assemble and then roll a tortilla, can it?!  Decent amount of chicken and fillings.  The best part was they included their special sauce to dip the wrap into.    The soup was pre-packaged and was pretty salty.  It was a tiny little cup.  Two packs of crackers came with the soup.  The salad was made up of iceberg lettuce, some shredded carrots and purple cabbage, some sliced celery, cucumber, and a tomato wedge.  All the veg seemed dry on the ends.  You choose the dressing.  It was just alright.  It seemed like a healthier choice.  There are so many other options here though."}
{"text":"Ordered 3 times from this location, and let me tell u I will never get my craving of swiss from here again. First time I ordered a quarter chicken meal and wings,  they forgot my utensils and vaggie sticks, witch woundnt have been a problem if I wasnt just moving into my new place that day. Second time was on my birthday I got a poutine&wings,  let me tell you it was horribly put together my gravey opend up in the bag,  their was cheese on only one side of my poutine and they then again forgot my vaggie sticks.. didn't help that the driver was a half hour late because he said \"the cops pulled him over \"witch made my food cold the last time I ordered again poutine and wings...  yet no vaggie sticks and gravy this time... if your looking to satisfie your craving for Swiss, please save yourself the headache oder from another location, it doesn't help that the phone operator who took my oders didn't speak English all 3 times I had to tell then to repeat then self."}
{"text":"This place won't honour SCENE POINTS to the full extent and only fraction. It's $350 max before tax not including alcohol, but the manager told me that they will only do $40. Total ripoff and very dishonest."}
{"text":"Poison. This location is by far the worst one out there. Ordered delivery - half chicken dinner with salad - took an hour and a half to come. The salad was brown and smelled. The chicken was horrendous."}
{"text":"I have to say this is probably the worst franchise I've been in (if it's corporate owned, that's even worse). I've tried the delivery and ended up with a ton of blood in the chicken and tried the delivery one other time with slightly better results. So I thought perhaps dining in would yield better results. I ordered the chicken and shrimp and um, no, still not great. The 1/4 chicken (dark meat) was the smallest chicken I'd ever seen -- probably not much bigger than a plump wing you'd get somewhere else -- I don't think I got 5 bites of meat from the entire serving -- think really small cornish hen and that's the size I got. Either this location uses different suppliers, or they just don't give a d*mn about their food quality."}
{"text":"Excellent service if we eat in and quick turn around if we take out. For the price you get a lot of food. Can't go wrong with a family pack when taking out."}
{"text":"I arrived so ridiculously early at yyz that Swiss chalet was literally my only option for anything.  The food was average breakfast food that was at least freshly made it seemed.  The service was EXCELLENT, which was really appreciated after a long red eye flight.  So the service and convenient hours bring the three star food up to my four star review"}
{"text":"This is the first Swiss Chalet I've seen that has a drive-thru.  They should really give up on it, as it doesn't work.  It's usually fairly slow (which I get to a point, it's not McDonalds so I know that it'll take longer, but it reaches a point where the concept simply doesn't fly) but our experience this past weekend was epic. In 25 minutes of waiting at the window, the gent ringing us through gave us change, took the change away, and then gave it back again.  I could see him running around the kitchen handling food after handling money at the till.  When we finally got our food and made it home, we realized that both of our supplied meals were wrong. We tried calling the restaurant/delivery number, but gave up after ten minutes on hold.  We packed everything up, brought it back to the restaurant, and requested a refund which we received.  After everything, over an hour had passed since we placed our original order.  We ended up in Safeway instead, bought a $9 roast chicken and some salads for sides, an were at home eating within 15 minutes of leaving Swiss Chalet.  I really do enjoy Swiss Chalet normally, but it's frustrating when you pay for something and the quality of service (can't comment on the quality of food on this visit unfortunately) is completely lacking."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Awesome service. Large portions. Treated the kids fantastic. Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I love Swiss Chalet, but THIS particular location bites the big one. I'll never go there again! We went there for dinner and my husband ordered the wings. I have no earthly idea why they ran out of the proper sauce that would normally go over Chicken Wings. For whatever reason, they smothered his wings with the sauce you would put on the ribs! Gross beyond gross!"}
{"text":"This has got to be the worst customer service ever. Waitress put our food on the table and left and didn't even get a chance to say that I ordered poutine instead of fries. I tried to wait for her but nowhere to be found. I just ate my food. Bill came and did charge me for poutine. Told her about it and she corrected but that's another 5 minutes wasted. Food - ok but they didn't have dark meat and we were given white meat instead and I hate white meat as it tends to be dry - we were told this 20 mins after we ordered and didn't get a chance to order something different. Was so hungry and frustrated. One waitress for 6 tables on a 8pm Thursday night. Seriously worst than going to a Chinese restaurant. I only went here because of our great experience at Swiss Chalet in Toronto but not ever going back to this location. I recommend ordering delivery."}
{"text":"It's swiss chalet!  The chicken is smaller than I remember.  Will get a double leg dinner next time.  The fries where not bad.  Great place to bring the kids.  Staff at this location were very friendly."}
{"text":"Mehhhhhhhhhhhhh  Nothing special ... I took my family here when I got home and couldn't believe the prices.  I guess since being in the states I am comparing at this point -  Does white and dark meat not come from the same chicken? two thighs and two breasts?  Why am I paying more for white when the chicken is equal most of my family members prefer dark anyways.    My new son in law got a special hair surprise which was well I would hope not on purpose but I do understand it can happen but I think its nasty.  Over all my experience at this location is pretty good - delivery is also an option.  I have noticed lately the skin seems to be an issue you either get skin and its mushy or you are missing most of the skin - quality control needs to step in I think."}
{"text":"Love this Swiss Chalet!   Shout out to Christine for amazing customer service!! Our friends had the messy chicken and I had the double leg dinner"}
{"text":"My husband took me here for dinner last night I was very disappointed, if not disgusted that we had ordered two festive special chicken and rib dinners, I had dark meat my husband had light both our stuffing was ice cold, ribs were dry over cooked and that wasn't the worst of it my husband went to cut into his chicken and raw blood came out! Mine appeared fine until I flipped it over and it was also not cooked! I told one waitress she took my husband's away and tried to bring back a piece of meat at that same time I noticed mine at which I asked another waitress finally she tried to take my plate I told her not to while she got the manager, manager came and took my knife and fork as she picked through the chicken insisting it was cooked! I said I manage a restaurant that is not cooked! I've cooked chicken, what was the internal temp? She swore it was always 190F I said then there shouldn't be any blood, yet when I asked to see a log she refused! I am so disgusted as I have worked in a food industry and food safety is a huge concern! I'm so lucky that my son only ordered chicken fingers! If he got sick eating there I don't know what I'd do! I think that being insulted as if I were trying to get a free meal, no apology at all, I will never eat there again, this manager has handled it incorrectly, sadly all she did was take the two meals off, and all I wanted was an apology not a accusative manager that doesn't care about food safety! I hope the CFIA goes and does a random temperature check. Ps we got no chocolates that were supposed to come with the meals because they took it off the bill I think that was a poor choice as well"}
{"text":"This was my first and last time coming to this location. Came here with my boyfriend. The host was good and we were seated promptly. Our server came and took our drink orders. When our meal came, we had to ask for the chalet sauce and for ketchup. Our server was taking way too long to bring the ketchup and chalet sauce, so we had to take the ketchup from a nearby empty table. Our server later showed up with our ketchup and chalet sauce. My boyfriend explained that we took the ketchup from another table. She said ok and began to walk away without giving us the chalet sauce she had in her hand. That's when my boyfriend said \"...we'll take the chalet sauce thou..\"  She laughed and brought the sauce back. We finished our meals and our waitress asked if we wanted to see the desert menu, which we said yes to. We ordered the mini donuts. The waitress took a couple of our side plates but left the rest...so we still had dirty dishes on our table when our dessert came...and they remained there when we ate our dessert. We even put all of our dishes near the edge of the table to make it easier for her to see/take. The picture of the dessert showed the donuts had plenty of powdered sugar on them. When our donuts arrived, there was barely a pinch of icing sugar on them. Only a couple of donuts actually had a sprinkle of the powdered sugar on them. When we finished our dessert, we waited exactly 28 minutes for our server to return. That's 28 minutes from when we finished the dessert...so we sat there with dirty dinner/dessert plates in front of us for nearly half an hour. Our server headed in our direction and was actually going to walk right past us when my boyfriend asked if we could have the bill. She said \"yes\" and kept walking...she didn't actually stop walking when my boyfriend asked for the bill. She brought the bill, we paid, and we left. I don't know if the servers there are overworked or undertrained, but at no point should I have to stare at dirty dishes while eating my dessert, wait practically 30 minutes to have the opportunity to ask for the bill, or ask for something that's supposed to come with the meal in the first place (chalet sauce). Won't be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Came to this Swiss chalet with my boyfriend and his parents to celebrate his dad's birthday. It was on a Saturday evening, so there was a lineup. We waited for about 15 minutes, and then we were seated.  The first thing I noticed were the empty tables. There were plenty of people waiting, and yet there were plenty of empty tables. Understaffed, perhaps?  Anyhow, our server was really sweet. She took our drink orders and returned in an amount of time that gave us the opportunity to go over the menu. We got two appetizers (chicken spring rolls and a garlic bread/bruschetta looking thing). We all got the quarter chicken meal, with the exception of my boyfriend who got some sort of combo deal where you get soup (or a slice of apple pie) and a honey quarter chicken meal.   Our apps come out after about 10-15 minutes. About 3-4 minutes after that, a expediter arrives with our meals. \"Uh, can we finish our appetizers first, please?\" The expo looked slightly confused, but she did take our food back to fester under the warming lamp while we ate.   If there's one thing I hate, it's when the entrees come out while we're still eating our apps or immediately after. Like geez, give the apps a second to marinate in my stomach for a bit!  Anyhow, the meal was brought out by our server about 5 minutes later. Even though she confirmed with me while ordering, she brought both me and my boyfriend the honey garlic chicken. She took it back and brought a regular quarter chicken meal within 3-4 minutes.   To summarize, very nice people, but two stars off for long waiting times even though there were lots of empty tables (Understaffed/under trained?), bringing out the entree while we've barely made a dent in our appetizers, and for bringing me the wrong meal."}
{"text":"I got delivery. The ribs here are incredibly dry. I use to go to the Swiss Chalet in Brampton and their ribs are mouthwatering. This one was scarcely sauced and dry, infact there was barely any sauce on it. The fries portion that was given was laughable as well."}
{"text":"I agree with other reviewers that this location really lets down the, now struggling, Swiss Chalet brand. My experiences with this location have been either takeout or delivery, and have ranged from mediocre at best, to utter disasters at worst. Generally speaking, Swiss Chalet is a guilty pleasure for me, so occasionally I choose to ignore the insanely inflated delivery pricing and their absurdly small chickens, to satisfy my craving. However, I have had so many bad experiences with this location that I was prompted to contact Cara Foods head office and beg to have the right to receive my delivery orders from the Bayview/Finch store, which is roughly the same distance from my Willowdale home as the Yonge Street store, however my request was denied. I have come to the conclusion that I need to just never again order delivery, and instead just drive and pick up my food from the Bayview location or the Victoria Park Harvey's / Swiss Chalet combo store, both of whom have not had the same problems with white, rubbery, stale french fries, undercooked pink chicken legs, and lukewarm gray bbq ribs with barbecue sauce that has been poured onto boiled ribs that have never seen the grill. (However, ordering food well done results in leathery, dried-out, chewy meat that is SO ridiculously inedible, that it seems like a political statement by the manager for daring to criticize.) The Harvey's / Swiss Chalet location on Victoria Park near the 401 consistently delivers exceptional Golden Brown french fries, and well prepared chicken and ribs that are juicy but with a nice external caramelization, even from the drive thru! Yet the Yonge Street store consistently disappoints, over and over and over again, despite all my best efforts. As others have noted, Swiss Chalet's portions have been shrinking dramatically while prices continue to inflate, with an unjustifiable premium placed on delivery orders, but if you choose not to give up on Swiss Chalet all together, and occasionally need some \"best anywhere french fries\" with Chalet sauce, definitely skip this location, and go hit up the Victoria Park location, for much better quality food product."}
{"text":"The takeout lady seemed to think we were ruining her life by ordering the 9.99 takeout chicken deal. She was very rude and it didn't seem like Someone was assigned to take out on a permanent basis and a waiter had to come off table service every time someone wanted delivery.   When we got home the chicken was underwhelming and the fries soggy and pitiful. Least it came with dipping sauce.   I haven't eaten Swiss chalet in years and this just makes me remember why."}
{"text":"Ah Swiss Chalet, that venerable Canadian institution, seems to be on its last legs. I can't remember the last time I was in one, it was most likely accompanying grandparents. Anyway to demonstrate our culinary culture to an American friend, we ended up there  Wednesday.   How times have changed! In addition to the venerable chicken and ribs, the chalet also offers chicken sandwiches, wraps, curries and all kinds of other foods to desperately try to attract the taste buds and wallets of us younger folk.  I had the chicken lunch special. A quarter chicken with mashed and a piece of pie for 9.99. My girlfriend had the open faced chicken sandwich. , which looked delicious. Our american friend was baffled by the generic chicken sauce and the lemon water to wash our hands. Midday on a weekday and the place was deserted.   Its hard to condemn this place but i feel that swiss chalet may be a bit past its prime."}
{"text":"Ordered take out the other day. I'm not a huge Swiss chalet fan but it's nearby. I ordered the kids chicken tenders and they were so hard and full of batter. It definitely wasn't fresh. I had their apple pie and it was so cold and all broken up. The perogies made up for the meal but won't be getting anything from here anytime soon. Their drive thru is ridiculously long so might as well call ahead or order delivery to save yourself some gas."}
{"text":"We had a coupon and neither of us could remember what Swiss Chalet was like so for something different we went to the one in Airdrie for an easy chicken dinner.  I ordered the double leg with loaded potato dinner and waited to see what I would get.  Honestly I think I will forever be disappointed at the loss of the old Roosters Quarters in Richmond, BC that was phenomenally good but went through some hard times and closed down.  The double leg was actually really good - the chicken was moist and the skin delicious.  The gravy was interesting - a little thinner than we'd like and a tad sweet but delicious with the chicken anyway.  The loaded potato was decent, needed the gravy but was pretty good for something simple.  All in all I'd eat there again, though hopefully the gravy will be thicker and the service a little quicker."}
{"text":"I went in on a rainy Thursday afternoon for lunch, hoping that I would be treating myself to a nice meal.  This location has a real nice decor, better than many of the other Swiss Chalet locations I've been to.  Got to the front and waited several minutes behind another couple who began to get fed up and went looking for a server. The manager appeared and apologized that he did not know where the FOH went, but he personally got us to out seats. The table I wanted to sit at had some spilled salt and I was fine to sit there, but he insisted it be cleaned before I sat and cleaned out himself. This and this only is why I had to give 2 stars.   The food was OK in respect to the chicken, which is always good at Swiss Chalet as well as the mashed potatoes.  Now, what I ordered was the 1/4 Chicken and 1/2 ribs dimner and the ribs were for the most part inedible. About 1/3 of them were cleaned properly and the other 2/3 were laddened with untrimmed fat. It was so gross that I did not finish them. The server was too nice for me to have to make her deal with this, so I paid and left.  I'll think long and hard when or if I decide to get some ribs from Swiss Chalet once again.  Great FOH team here, but the kitchen is another story."}
{"text":"I'm gonna be honest, if it was my first time here id probably write a bad review but it isn't my first time so I can't.  A couple years ago Swiss chalet was the perfect place that really 'hit the spot'. It was good chicken , the best fries and bomb Swiss chalet sauce. The right place for the family to come together and eat a nice meal together without hurting the wallet. But somewhere down the line things went wrong and everything seems different.   The chicken is still okay the sauce too but the quality of the fries are so much worse now.   My experience today:  As soon as we sat down the server came over with butter and ketchup I don't know why since we haven't opened the menu yet. All she said was \"can I get you something to drink \" Some servers are good some are not so good. Also when we got our food she also brought the bowl with hot water and lemon. The food was as it always was just okay ."}
{"text":"Took my parents here who are long time Swiss Chalet patrons and they loved it. Chicken was fresh and not greasy, service was friendly and helpful, even though it's not a full service location. This will be my go to spot when I'm craving Swiss Chalet."}
{"text":"While celebrating the day of 3 decades of Dave, my family opted for Swiss Chalet. Their County Court location is close to where they live, and you really can't go wrong with SC.  This location seemed a little more spacious compared to other locations I've been to, and was very clean. Our waitress was extremely down-to-earth and was a lot of fun, without being intrusive at all. I ordered the burger (natch), and the rest of the fam went for the chicken and ribs.  I was hearing nothing but great things about the other food, and the burger was more than acceptable. It really doesn't make a big splash when compared to some of the other heavy-hitting burgasm candidates I've sampled as of late, but there was nothing wrong with it at all. And as an added bonus, the topic of my birthday came up in conversation as the waitress was coming around, and she was nice enough to sneakily bring me a birthday piece of apple pie and ice cream free of charge. Very sweet.  In terms of chains, Swiss Chalet is always a safe bet, and this is probably their best location that I've been to."}
{"text":"I ordered the side ribs dinner this weekend for around $16 , it was 4 ribs and they were tasty but a bit overcooked as they fell apart. I wouldn't normally order this as its very pricey but I had a $10 discount so what the heck. The service was great but not worth the price of the meal. In my opinion the prices are high and the food is just average. Let me say the staff is great but the prices generally too high for my buget."}
{"text":"Came here as part of a group of 4 on Jan. 4 and even though it wasn't all that busy around 5 pm when we arrived the service was quite mediocre. Our server didn't introduce herself nor give us cutlery until we asked for it. To start our group ordered a coffee, tea and root beer. During our time there ( 1 hour) we never had an offer for a refill of any of the drinks. The server left us unattended for long periods of time and wasn't very good at taking our orders. Overall our service was well below the levels we have come to expect at this location."}
{"text":"My Saturday evening experience here is vastly different than the other two reviewers.  Perhaps it was our server that made the difference.  Stephanie Ann was bright and fun.  Very knowledgeable about the menu.  This was great especially considering one of our group needed gluten free.  Service was quick.  I ordered Chicken Parmesan.  The dish was very tasty and rivaled the Veal Parmesan I had had two days prior at an authentic Italian place.  I was with a group of 8.  We were keyed up and in a party mood.  I'm not local to Calgary but I frequent Swiss Chalet and will certainly keep this location in mind for future visits."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what happened to this location or Swiss chalet in general!  It used to be synonymous with quality, ease of service and family oriented.  Lately I've experienced nothing but poor quality service in-store, delivery and on the App that shuts down all the time whilst ordering.  Then you are forced to call and order where I get attitude \"did you mean French fries\" when I ordered a kids chicken finger meal with \"fries\".  The first sentence I receive is \"delivery is $3.50\" instead of thanking me for my patronage.  Then mark up on white meat, mark up on using debit.  They seemed to want to talk me out of ordering.  Raw chicken consistently at this location.  Had enough with the poor service.  Decided I will not eat at Swiss Chalet again.  The Q on the Queensway is of great quality and good service.  So I'm switching for good.  Bye bye Swiss Chalet.  You have to seriously pull it together!"}
{"text":"We took my boyfriend's Dad for dinner and he wanted Swiss Chalet.  I haven't been in a long time, but I do crave the double leg meal and some sauce on occasion.  Our server was very sweet and tried very hard, but there was a bit of a language barrier.  My boyfriend ordered a diet coke and there was some schmutz on his glass. We had to wait a long time and then flag her down to show her. She apologized profusely and replaced the drink immediately.  Food was typical. My boyfriend and I both had the 1/3 rack of ribs and 1/4 chicken dinner and his father had the Chicken Stir Fry. nothing was great and nothing was awful, but I think this is one of the reasons that people like Swiss Chalet so much; they know what to expect.  When we told our server that we were done, she left our plates in front of us but went to get the bill. Then she wished us a good sleep that night. Which was weird, but sweet."}
{"text":"I ordered fish and chips. Two bites into my fish, I realize the middle of the fillet was raw. I sent it back, and I was polite about it. It's not the server's fault. My food was replaced no problem, however I'm a bit upset that I was still charged full price for my meal.  I feel that, when food is undercooked and sent back, it should be complimentary. I will not be returning to this restaurant because of my bill and no apologizes made for the undercooked fish."}
{"text":"Ordered perogies via the drive thru window and waited over 15 minutes.   Not sure what the hold up was for. No cars ahead of me at 3pm and these perogies are probably fried/warmed up from frozen!"}
{"text":"Every time we visit Toronto, we have to visit Swiss Chalet. It's consistent, this one is newer, clean, with ample parking and right next to a Tim Hortons.  We arrived around 5ish, seated promptly, the restaurant had a steady stream of take out customers and filled up by the time we were leaving.  Our waitress was very friendly and efficient, checking on with us every so often to see if we needed anything. The food was on par with any other Swiss Chalet I have ever been to, we just love the poutine with chicken on top. The food came out quickly and is always nice and hot. I had the Festive Special, the stuffing was meh; but everything else was great!  All positive things with this location, will definitely return when coming home to visit!"}
{"text":"I would give zero stars if I could.  I'm  keeping tabs of how long in between visits it's been with my waitress.  It's approximately 20 minutes a time.  I ordered my food around 6:50.  I also have been staring at this un-bussed table they left about 30 minutes ago.  I'm slowly adding my empty drink glasses to that table.  I'm really disappointed with the service here.  The hostess even gave me a hard time when I came in.  I said I needed a table for 5, she said she counts 4 of us.  Well we all arrived in different cars."}
{"text":"I have a weakness for Swiss Chalet so I'm biased. And to my great delight my biases were reinforced. A quarter chicken witha 1/3 of a rack of ribs left me stuffed and sated. Fantastic flavours, the meat was very tender and the service superb (thank you Laura!) My one complaint would be the microscopic portion of cole slaw. I think they could offer a little more and not lose the profit margin."}
{"text":"Bad bad bad! We waited over 40 minutes for our food and it was so disgusting I couldn't even eat it. Dry chicken, hard veggies and goopy potatoes. This place needs revamped in a BIG way. Everything is so outdated and ugly. Wont be back."}
{"text":"I was in a hurry and needed to eat lunch quickly. I got my order quickly and the waitress was friendly. I would come here again."}
{"text":"Since I work close I have been coming here for 5 years.  Back then it would have been a 4.5 star for sure..  ribs actually rivaling some of the better offerings around the area.  I have been here twice now in the last 30 days and it seems a trend of smaller portions is setting in.  I am not sure if this is franchise wide or just this location.  Chicken was still tasty but minus the bones I estimate 2-3 oz."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I frequent this location at least 2-3 times a month. If there were other closer ones we would go there instead.  The food here is great, waitresses are always pleasant and food is served in a reasonable time.  However, the hostess at the front is not very personable/pleasant. She doesn't smile or look at you when she's talking to you. She'll show you to your seat and explain the specials while she's actually starting to walk away.   If we didn't like the food and other staff, we wood probably not go there again.   Word of advice, if it's your first time there, ignore the hostess' lack of people skills because the rest of your visit will make up fo"}
{"text":"Terrible parking. Do not honor yelp check in discount at this location. Good service, poor management."}
{"text":"When dinning in restaurant everything is great. I've never had an issue when I go for dinner in but take out and delivery from this restaurant in particular has been nothing but bad experiences of things such as missing food, stale/rotting old food as if it was left overs earlier in the day. I continuously have missing items from my order and with my usual chicken caesar salad 2/3 times I order it they've forgotten to add the salad dressing therefore I've gotten plain salad with a sad piece of chicken, once even forgetting the croutons as well and even though I've complained (both to the restaurant and head office) it keeps happening... -' _ '-"}
{"text":"First off, let me say that I love Swiss Chalet as a restaurant. It's actually my favourite place to eat because I grew up eating there (at the old Brampton location, over the bridge from this location - which was WAY cooler because it had all that wood work decor) but I now live in the States, so I only get to eat here once or twice a year.  This review is solely about this location.  Yesterday (Jan 2016) my family visited this location and sat down to have a weekend lunch time meal. There was a small crowd when we arrived (less than 50 people in the restaurant). We requested a table for 5 adults and one baby (high chair). We were asked if we wanted a booth with a high chair - to which my party asked if 5 adults would fit in a booth. They quickly changed their plans (\"oh, 5 adults?\") and showed us to a table set for 5 adults and a kids menu.   No problem.   I held my 2 year old daughter and waited for the high chair to arrive. After about 2 minutes of standing and waiting, my mother decided she would just go grab one - not knowing that they lock together. When she struggled with it for only 30 seconds, someone noticed and came to help. She brought it over and we all got seated.   Ok, no problem.   10 minutes or so later, we were asked if we wanted to start with drinks or just go ahead and order. We placed our order because for the most part, we're boring and always get the same thing. 5 Chicken Dinners with Salads, two sides of fries and one order of Chicken & Pasta.   15 minutes later, the cold drinks arrived but no coffee (we only ordered one). We were informed that they were making a fresh pot.   Again, no problem.   10 minutes later, we asked if the coffee was ready - to which she clearly told us she forgot and that it would be out immediately.   5 minutes later, the coffee arrives.   About 15 minutes later we are told that the meal is coming right out - but the pasta wasn't ready yet. We tell her that's fine and to bring whatever was ready out.   10 minutes later, all the food arrives, including the pasta. All of it cold, including the two sides of fries we ordered (which arrived individually, 4 minutes apart). The exception was the Chalet dipping sauce. It was hot. My wife who worked in the food industry said that the pasta was likely the hold up and all the other dishes were sitting ready while they made it.   The other thing I noticed was the oddly small sized chicken portions. The meals are $10+ - so I figured you'd receive at least $4 or $5 worth of chicken.... but these poor chicks.... they were the runts of the litter, I guess - which is funny because all you hear about is how chickens are demanded to grow faster and bigger than ever.   Now, to be fair, I enjoyed visiting with my family, colouring with my daughter and feeding her crackers. I know it's not entirely the servers fault, or the chefs fault, but YIKES. I am ultra passive when it comes to complaining, but I'm I know my parents won't be returning to this location because of how disappointing it was. We did notice that during the Sunday afternoon rush - there was an odd amount of empty seats for Swiss Chalet - even as the lunch hour continued - which might indicate that others have had similar experiences - or maybe it was just a slow day.... we have to give the benefit of the doubt, right?   Slow service (1 1/4 hour from enter to exit) and cold food. Sad because I really like Swiss Chalet. They are normally Aces - like the one in Sarnia, ON - which I sometimes cross the boarder to go to when I am in the neighborhood.... but this one, I would not recommend it."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery. The rude driver who was late  commented in a derogatory way towards my age to be funny. The food was cold, chicken was dry and rest was horrible.  I was still hungry after. Not enough food for what you pay. The gravy tasted like dish water."}
{"text":"Mom's fries and wings were cold, we sent them back. Restaurant was not busy. By the time she finished her ribs and I finished my meal, her fries and wings showed up. I said: that took a long time. She said: well they had to cook them. Me: so they weren't cooked the first time you served us cold food?! She didn't get it. No compensation offered.  Bathroom is not wheelchair accessible. My mom had to use the mall washroom with her scooter. While I was using their non accessible \"accessible\" washroom, a man was trying to push his wife in a wheelchair through the door. He said: I can't go in. I said: I'll help her get to the washroom. He thanked me the four times he passed us.   I brought this up to the manager. Here is a couple where the husband needs to assist his wife and it's not a designated accessible gender neutral washroom so he couldn't go in to help her. That's terrible! The AODA states you have to be accessible. Manager: oh I'll bring that up as we're about to add a Harvey's here and we're going to do a bit of remodelling. That would be great! (I'm not holding my breath though)"}
{"text":"I really love Swiss Chalet since I used to work for them decades ago.  I'm addicted to their Chalet Sauce and might someday replace my Java consumption with Da Sauce!  Mobile ordering was quick and take out service staff had my dinner ready before the projected Ready By time displayed on the Swiss Chalet phone app.  Tonight it was large fries ($6.99) and da sauce ($0.79 per 12 ounces) for a bite out.  Delicious...Double thumbs up!  Note: The minimum order for the mobile app is $8.99 before taxes."}
{"text":"It's okay but definitely not the best out there.  The take out window took some time to receive my order. If you are at near Ryerson, I guess it's an okay choice. But there are something similar and possibly better/closer if you are willing to walk toward east on dundas."}
{"text":"I don't get to this location often but it is much nicer since they renovated it. My friend and I went for lunch one day and her favourite server is Amit. So when my other friend and I went for dinner, Amit greeted us and asked if we would like a booth or table. I said: as long as it's with you, I don't care where we sit!! He laughed and enjoyed that telling another server what I said.   I let him know about my previous visit with my friend, he told me to tell her hi. I sent her a text and let him know she said hi back.  Back to the food part of this review. I have noticed that since they have gone \"healthy\" the flavour of some menu items has changed. IE: the Caesar salad. Nice clean restaurant. Bathrooms are downstairs."}
{"text":"Picked up takeout dinner using Lindt Chocolate coupon of 2 quarter chicken (dark meat) dinners for $14.99, plus I ordered 2 chicken soups for $7.00 as well.  They ran out of dark meat and offered white meat for the same price; no hesitation on my part!  I'm a Swiss Chalet junkie.  Meal and service was excellent and would have given 5 stars but I'm eating out of take-out containers and not in the restaurant dining room. Didn't forget my 7 Scene points either."}
{"text":"The staff was laughing at me cause I couldn't understand what she said well. And then she said much faster than before. I was really upset I ll never come here."}
{"text":"What can be said about Swiss Chalet? No, seriously: what can be said about Swiss Challet? I'm sure everyone knows what they're about and the only particulars to report about this location is that the service was pretty good and timely."}
{"text":"I have not had Swiss Chalet in years after living in TX and California, so it was a real treat for me to have lunch here and order the half dark chicken meal.  The roast chicken was as I remembered it - tasty, tangy and juicy.  The fries are on the soft side, but I'm a sauce-dipper, so it made for a great carby plate.  This particular Swiss Chalet location looked fairly updated. Service was prompt and friendly.  The menu has grown to include a lot of different non-chicken options. I will have to try them the next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Considering it's 1:58pm, me and 3 other tables; why did I just receive barely warm food and ribs that were tough?! And that's after I specifically requested that my potato be hot! Sad state of affairs in this location. Or is it Swiss Chalet's new business practice? Similar issue at two locations.   Having to send food back is wasteful and discourages me from returning."}
{"text":"This Swiss Chalet location is only for take-out and delivery which works great for me.  I tend to stick with the chicken soup, which is amazingly hearty but once you order 3 (because for 2 ppl that like it a lot, 1 ain't enough) it comes to nearly the same price as two regular meals ($15!) so that sucks. That isn't this location's fault, though.   It's good and quick and convenient, so it's worth it when you don't want to stop by a busy restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday lunch. The place wasn't that packed. The service was somewhat slow, took about 20-30 minutes to get our food.  We got a mix of stir fry and double legged chicken. There's not a lot of vegetarian options, maybe only 4 in the whole menu. There's also not a lot of options where you can play around with the meat dishes and take meat away to make it vege. The food was okay, my chicken was a bit undercooked, I could see the pink.  I thought the portion sizes were okay for a lunch but the prices definately was high. Came upto 20$ for a combo.   The restaraunt itself is bigger than other locations. Surprised I've never seen it fill."}
{"text":"I can only give zero stars because I didn't even get to eat. After waiting in line to place my drive through order I was told when I got to the window that they could not accept my gift card. Apparently they installed some new computer system that would not allow them to process gift cards. No sign at the drive through menu board, and I wasn't asked how I would be paying. They wasted my time and then made their problem mine when I tried to pay with one of their gift cards. Since I didn't have an extra $50 for dinner with me i ended up having to leave with no food! I know I can't be the only person who was given a gift card for Christmas- I'm sure there are tons of them in the area. This location needs to get its act together and figure out how to deal with this issue properly without punishing their customers."}
{"text":"First thing's first: Swiss Chalet deserves credit for serving fresh cut fries, and for doing so literally decades before it became a trend.  It was fairly quiet when I came in, which is probably a sign that Swiss Chalet are having a hard time attracting customers like they used to (hence their announced plans to try and reinvent the chain recently). But am I ever glad there were only 25 or so patrons in here, because there was literally only one front-line staff acting as both host and server.  The server deserves credit for pretty much having to run between tables, but it made for fairly poor customer service overall which is a fault of management. I see a few other reviews mentioning similar issues, so keep that in mind.  Still, the food was adequate, so it squeaks by with 3 stars."}
{"text":"I didn't choose to go there but had some beef with mashed potatoes and gravy and vegetables and pasta. Pasta was ok nothing special and the beef wasn't too bad either. I just wonder if they make that gravy from scratch or if they add some sauce mix to it because it did taste like it.  The desert was the best. Their mini donuts are the best I have ever had. Even better than Tiny Tom's mini donuts. The Swiss Chalet donuts are so crispy! Very delicious. It's worth just going there for the donuts. I can't rate the rest of their food though but based on what I had it was alright."}
{"text":"Remember when you were young and you saw some cartoon on tv and thought it was the greatest show you have ever seen? Well... was it really the best show ever? No.   Was it the best show you have seen at that point in your life? Yes. Well, Swiss Chalet is just like that. If you went there when you were a kid and you liked it, chances are you will have a soft spot for it --however, and specially if you are a Yelper-- this also means that at one point or other you have had some really, really great chicken dish in your life.  So what I am saying is, your memories of Swiss Chalet will be a lot more memorable and tasty then the food you will be served here today. Memory can be a fickle lady, my friends.   I had the double leg combo with mash potato and let me just begin by saying my chicken portion was small and were inconsistently cooked. No, I do not think it was raw although I did see very mild tints of red... furthermore I was not the only one who ordered this dish and everyone's else order looked very different than mine. As in crispier, darker, smaller, crunchier...someone else's seemed like their pieces were larger, etc.  The 'slab' of potato mash looked as if it has been scooped into my plate and was far from appetizing. To be honest, I think my 'dinner' resembled  what I would qualify as hospital food.   Boring and tacky presentation, plates too large for portions but in that \"we-only-have-this-set-of-plates,-sir!\" and again that scooped-in feeling, the one you may have seen in cafeteria food and of course, the small portions.   ...And all of these for the cheap price of $15 with tip included! Seriously? I can literally think of dozens of restaurants where I can get a much better meal for the same price and if you talking Korean or say Ethiopian than for about half the price!   At one point when we needed to get our waitress I literally had to go look for her. Both times I had to ask a second server who was a little too quick to point out that we were not in his area and that he could not help me, although he changed his mind and said that he would look for her. By the end, since I had to leave earlier than the rest of the group, I had to go to the kitchen entrance to flag someone for our bill.   Don't get me wrong, it was great chatting with other Yelpers and just basking in the kitsch value. However, when it comes to Swiss Chalet, I rather just relive my childhood memories nourished by the power imagination than having to eat here again.      A shame."}
{"text":"Not my favorite place but I enjoyed lunch here!!!! Their special was 2 quarter meals for 15.99 which comes with a quarter chicken roll and a side. I think this deal is for a week only. We added a chicken spring roll appetizer. Everything was pretty good. Always hated the chicken sauce always thought it tasted like the Chinese bitter tea, but I asked for BBQ sauce instead! Always love the rolls and spring rolls was the first time I tried. Although my friend liked the spring rolls I thought it was a little dry! Besides being Little slow most waiters are older but super friendly and nice!"}
{"text":"Some Swiss Chalet's are good, some are poor and some keep you coming back with good food and service. This location is the third type and keeps my fiance and I coming back over and over when the two can dine specials come on.  The staff is solid and has never let us down in making us happy. The food is usually pretty quick (obviously depending on how busy it is at the time) and more often than not the fries are fresh and crispy which can be tough to come by in other locations.  Favorites on the menu include of course the two can dine specials when they come on, (fiance prefers white meat, I like dark) with fries and the delicious chalet sauce. We almost always get the garlic cheese loaf as an appetizer which is great for sharing, but if I had the option to make this a 4.5 star rating, the reason is its the 1 food item that is super fantastico when its done right, but can be underwhelming with lack of cheese and flavor and freshness if they aren't on their best game (just like fries). Thank goodness 9/10 times the fries and cheese loaf are great.  Overall, it may be a chain restaurant, but its our favorite swiss chalet location and has won us over others so much that we probably get it every 2 weeks. I think other people are reviewing it low because in signal hill people tend to think their money is worth more or something and love to expect a $100 meal for $40"}
{"text":"Solid Swiss chalet. You know how some of them seem to have ok food and some locations poor? Well this one has shown consistently good food for three visits and we have been happy, large area supports our large extended family. All in all my favourite Swiss chalet location of the city."}
{"text":"My friend wanted Swiss Chalet for dinner but also wanted to make sure these were hand cut fries. Thank goodness they were. We had the ribfest special. Good food. Nice server."}
{"text":"I would give it a 5 star but the last time I got food from here I realized wen I got back home that something was missing which I paid for An that sucks  but oh well lessened learned always what I have before I leave places An rather then getting upset I truly wanna believe it was just an honest mistake but I do plan to have some kind words wit the ppl who works there next time I go  Cus mistakes are made which we all know but if u don't say nothing in a nice a kind way they probably won't learn but other then that it's great!"}
{"text":"Food was alright as you might expect from a swiss chalet.  Unfortunately the staff here were very rude to us. I have been to many swiss chalets and I usually experience good service.  There was an issue with or young 6 month old child's child seat where they insisted on us putting her in a regular chair but we were not comfortable with that. They then refused us the use of a child seat.  They actually gave it to us they l then took it away. If you have young children AVOID this specific swiss chalet.  They made it clear to me they did not like to encourage families with young children here.  If swiss chalet management is reading this then know the biggest issue we had was with the manager on location Saturday March 7 2015 dinner time.   Beyond the issue I described above this manager was incredibly rude to us."}
{"text":"Haven't dined here for a while and decided to just grab a quick dinner.  It's obviously Swiss Chalet so wouldn't expect a gourmet feast!  However, today's visit reminded me why we have steered clear for the past few years...and should stay away!  Ordered the classic quarter chicken entree with side garden salad and roll; chicken was okay, not piping rotisserie hot, salad portion was smaller than expected.  Hubby tried the quarter chicken and shrimp rice pilaf; he was a little mortified that chicken was a bit too 'red' for his liking and rice pilaf portion was very modest.  This is something we've noticed...prices have now gone up a couple of bucks over the years yet portions are unsatisfying!  Better to just swing over to the adjoining Harvey's instead where you are guaranteed better bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"We normally really enjoy Swiss Chalet but this visit we were met by a waitress who seemed to want to be anywhere else. The meal itself was okay until we went to order dessert. Apparently the ice cream freezer had been unplugged so we couldn't even get our dessert."}
{"text":"A Canadian institution, if ever there was one.   The chicken is still good, although most of the \"diversify or die\" options are pretty innocuous and the ribs are horribly overpriced [like all ribs, in all restaurants].  I remember eating at the first one opposite Varsity Stadium in the early 1970s. Of course the portions were twice as large back then, but what really stood out were the INSANE prices on the liquor and wine menu. I don't know who was running F&B back then, but their bottles of wine were literally half the price of other places and you could get a shot of Remy Martin VSOP for slightly over the cost you paid when you filled out those cheesy slips of paper with tiny pencils at the LCBO up on Dupont.  It was the cheapest place to tie one on in all of Toronto, if you didn't mind the blue rinse set [and they didn't mind you]. We'd get buzzed there and then go to the El Mocambo for the rest of the evening...happy days."}
{"text":"Used to like Swiss Chalet. This place is a travesty. It took ages to get seated, they mixed up our orders, and the food was stone cold when it finally arrived.   Our waitress was an older lady who told us to our face that she couldn't wait for her Christmas break from the restaurant. I can understood how she felt, but I'm not sure a server should be telling customers she can't wait to get out of the place. To her credit, when we pointed out the fries were stone cold, she brought out new ones, but she must have known how long they'd been sitting under the lamps, surely?  All in all, the entire place felt like a person who dislikes what they're doing for a living, and is just going through the motions. Maybe it's just this location, but if the issues are widespread, this Canadian institution is heading in the wrong direction."}
{"text":"We had a fair sized group and i love the way this place can accomodate us without any warning and make everyone feel comfortable.  This is why its a great go to place when you have family or friends who all want to get together for any reason and these guys are in business to do business and that includes keeping the customer happy.  All in all the food took a while to get out to the table but with a group thats fairly large, this is to be expected, since we all want to eat at the same time.  Other than that the chicken was good, the rips were awesome, the shrimp was A-OK, the garlic cheese loaf was tasty, the salad with the house dressing was good, the roast beef dinner was delish, the spring rolls were fresh and tasty, and the service was attentive.  This left us with no complaints, and a wonderful night of socializing with good friends, and we appreciate not being hustled out, we know we were there for a while but they kept serving and we kept enjoying."}
{"text":"went once, wasn't ideal--gave it a second shot, never going back. had to wait almost 10 mins at take out counter even with multiple people walking by, just to get rude service and not even end up eating there because of it. try another location, this one is brutal."}
{"text":"This is a pretty decent Swiss Chalet location. For one thing, they have semi-private party rooms, which is pretty special.   The service was pretty good. Our server was friendly and mostly attentive, though there were moments where she wasn't to be seen when we needed her. Probably because she didn't have a good sightline of us, seeing as we were in a party room.  I was happy to find the chicken was the same as it always was, though a bit on the salty side (so.. same as it always was). They changed their fries a few years ago and I still like them. All in all, I enjoyed my meal and couldn't even finish the double leg with fries meal ($10.50!) A welcome change from a few years back in the same location when a chicken leg was smaller than the size of my hand.  For those who can't have dairy, you can check out the website and it will tell you if any of their food has allergens in them. Pretty handy.  A great spot for a nice, simple meal. Or a first date."}
{"text":"This Swiss Chalet is rarely packed and you will most likely be able to always find a table if you drop by. My friend and I got quarter chicken dinners. Delicious and consistent Swiss Chalet service and quality."}
{"text":"Great value and (almost) always great for delivery.  I regularly order online for delivery and it's quick and easy.  The website is easy to use which makes ordering a breeze.  The delivery is always within the specified time and I find the prices to be pretty reasonable for what you get.  I will mention the only drawback that I've found.  While they are fantastic when ordering for \"right now\", they're horrible if you order in advance for a specified time.  I find that they tend to be over an hour early (once when I wasn't home yet).  So, I don't use this option anymore.  The food itself has always been good, especially for the price.  Not much to say here since it's just like any other Swiss Chalet.  I've dined in a few times and have always had a pleasant experience.  The service is always very friendly and quick.  There's also always a manager who checks on tables too.  Finally, I'd like to mention picking up orders.  You have to pick up orders at Harvey's, which can be horribly slow and painful.  During peak periods (since I eat when normal people eat) I've had to wait anywhere between 10-20 min just to pick up food just because of the volume of people there.  I try to avoid picking up food around dinner time because the wait is horribly painful.  They should really have a separate cash just for pickup orders.   For delivery (not in advance) and dine-ins I'd recommend this Swiss Chalet location.  Food is consistently good and the service, whether it be waiters or drivers, are friendly and quick!"}
{"text":"Second time at this restaurant.  Really like their service.  Quick, efficient and respectful.  Wait for their specials, it's worth it.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst Swiss chalet you could order from, from my personal experience. I have ordered from this place 4 times and I had to complain 3 times. The food either arrive cold or is the wrong order. And this time, the manger basically refuse to communicate with me regarding the wrong order, simply because the restaurant is busy. Now I really do feel like I'm paying so that people who are bad at their job, people who bad attitude could keep being the same way.  NEVER AGAIN"}
{"text":"Well i finally got around to trying their new fried chicken, and i have to say that i rather enjoyed it.  I would even admit that as i write this review, this would be the second time this week that i have had it.  Some of their new items have not been my taste but this one seems to be a real winner, at least i think so.  Since its a limited time thing, i guess i will just enjoy it for now and appreciate the flavor.  Price wise, it was a bit more expensive than their competitors fried chicken entree, but i dont care, since its a novelty for now.  Thats just my opinion, but i enjoyed the new dish and look forward to others"}
{"text":"I ordered takeout from this location. Special instructions were made to not ring the doorbell and to please knock.   The driver rang the doorbell and knocked so loudly several times. I opened the door and he left the food sitting on my porch as he stood halfway down the steps, ready to go. His car door was still open, so maybe he was in a rush, but this doesn't give him the excuse to be so impolite and unprofessional.   I told him he didn't have to knock so loudly and over and over again. We have a newborn, so we really wanted the special instructions respected. Our little one woke up and our night was ruined.   My whole experience with Swiss Chalet was ruined by this one driver. My wife and I won't be ordering from this location ever again. Terrible experience."}
{"text":"Swiss Chalet has always been a favourite of mine. Their quarter chicken combo with fries, a roll, coleslaw, and their Chalet sauce? CAN I GET A YAAAAAAS! We arrived here on a weekday around lunchtime but there was plenty of seating. We were seated immediately and our server Jaclyn was super nice and funny too.   The food came at an appropriate time and it was delicious. I got their special: the crispy quarter chicken combo. It was delicious! Everything came out hot. No complaints. Would totally return if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"so disappointing, since I've gone to this location before and many others in the past but this one had clearly dropped in service and customer experience.  To start, we were told the first half of the menu wasn't availabe, as we were seated at a booth for 6 (for a party of 2) even though other smaller booths were available- but we were still given extra menus.  Waited 5 min to be served, and then the server came over since they thought we were waiting for more guests when it was just 2 (because of the extra menus). Eventually ordered drinks that took around 5 min to arrive yet it wasn't even busy.  Went on to order a bread loaf appetizer that took over 10 min, and eventually that never came because we got sick of waiting especially after being told that none of the signage/promos were available because they wanted to update their menus before any of the promos began? Strange.. especially after being told this by a random server who came by to ask if we ever ordered after seeing us sitting there.. eternally waiting.  The promo was also beginning tomorrow, which I think they should have just honoured for not mentioning it, and for posting their new promos before they begin - if you're going to do that, make it 100% clear that none of the signage etc is available.  Poor location and wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Service was slow, waitress messed up our order, and on top of that our server couldn't even crack a smile. Usually I like Swiss chalet, but I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"This store manager offered me a dessert after an incident was escalated.   A driver delivered the wrong order for me and my co-workers. Basically- he gave us an extra bag- which had chocolate bars and salads and some scratch and save cards. We thought that Swiss chalet may have thrown it in for free. One co-worker even proceeded to open the lid of the salad. Thank god he didn't take a bit,  the driver returned 5 minutes later and grabbed items from our table and said (wrong order) in a packed corporate cafeteria.   It was very embarrassing. Store manager apologized and advised that this is not how a delivery should be made.   He then offered me a \"free cheesecake\". What am I a child?  Like give me a free meal at least."}
{"text":"If I could give this location 0 stars, I would.  There's no way to explain how terrible the customer service is at this particular Swiss Chalet and the amount of incompetent students working here that do not give a f*ck about their job and have no sense of urgency.  (Apologies for my language)..  It was as if the manager hired a bunch of snails and sloths to work for him.  I came here to get take out for dinner and when I walked in, the place was so smoky with no venation.  The line for take out was ridiculous at 6pm on a Saturday night.  I waited approximately 15 minutes for my order to be taken.  I ordered a Family Pak with a side of Cheese Perogies.  After paying for the order, I realized that the girl didn't even charge me for the Cheese Perogies so I butted back in line to question her.  She rang the Cheese Perogies in the system and charged me for it and told the kitchen that my order was to be sent out together.  30 minutes later, we were still waiting for our order and I noticed that there were a couple of people that were getting impatient as well and were complaining why their order was taking so long.  In addition to the people waiting for their Swiss Chalet orders, the people that were ordering Harverys had no one putting condiments on the burgers, and the people at the drive thru weren't getting their orders either.  40 minutes goes by and we finally get our order only to realize that the lady charged me for Spring Rolls rather than Cheese Perogies.. At this point, I was livid, and I told them that I didn't order Spring Rolls.  She apologized and said that they were making it right now and handed me the Spring Rolls and said I could keep it.  I had two options at this point, to wait around for the perogies or line up in the ridiculously long line up to get my refund.. So I decided to just wait - thinking that it wouldn't take that long for them to fry up some overpriced pre-made perogies.  Boy was I wrong... Another 30 minutes go by and I'm still waiting for the Cheese Perogies.  I looked at the line up for take out and it was practically out the door, with at least 5 people waiting for their food who have already paid.  All the people that were in front of us in line, had already got their food and left and we were still waiting.  I was getting so impatient that the first employee that came out of the kitchen - I stopped her and asked her about the perogies.  She kept calling out numbers and every number she called out I asked what was in the order.  The order she had in her hand was a Salad, Chicken and a Soup.  I remember her calling out the same order 15 minutes ago and I let her know that the person who placed that order, already got his order and has left.  They made the order twice because the guy was complaining.  Why in the world would you ring in the order twice if you know the kitchens in the process of making the order already?  I look around and everyone in the restaurant was furious and I kid you not - I saw at least a dozen people working in the back kitchen trying to put orders out.  NONE OF THEM CAPABLE OF DOING ANYTHING!..  Finally, after waiting for an hour for the perogies and having my clothes smell like I just worked a shift at Swiss Chalet, I got them and asked for the managers name.  Rino is the manager who works at this location, and I wasn't going to waste anymore time waiting to speak to him but I will make it known here as well as head office that this location is a piece of crap.  Avoid this location at all costs and I will never come back ever again!"}
{"text":"I did some order online and the price was acceptable. Around $14 including tax and delivery for a quarter chicken with fries. However the food was pretty bad. The fries was soggy and cold, which is kinda understandable since its Canada and -10 outside. The one thing I was quite sad about was that the amount of fries was so little. It doesn't even fill the box. And the chicken is most likely less than a quarter chicken. Wouldn't suggest anyone to order delivery"}
{"text":"Okay...So the boy ranted and raved about Swiss Chalet and their **SAUCE** So I was excited to try their food since I'm a foodie and sadly (Babe, sorry to burst your bubble) but it was just ok. Not bad, Not great just ok. The chicken was good and the sides were okay but nothing really special or delicious and once again my fries were over done (that bugged me beyond belief) and the sauce had me confused as to wither it should be on a dessert or some weird spiced filling for a cream puff. I can't wait until the boy comes to visit so I can take him to Boston Market our version of Swiss Chalet."}
{"text":"3 words: DON'T DO IT!!! chicken is very, VERY dry.  Had to send it back to the kitchen.  2nd batch was better.... but just the thought that they could have brought out the dry chicken to begin with!  Took too much time to get it right. Sigh, I used love swiss chalet when I was growing up. Tisk tisk..."}
{"text":"Swiss Chalet is one of our family default go to places because there's something for everybody.  Whether it's chicken different ways, the new rotisserie beef menu or good old fashioned ribs there's options that can satisfy our group.  While this isn't one of the normal locations we frequent, we ended up coming to this Financial Drive location in Mississauga because it's very close to my where my relatives live.    We were 7 in total and upon entering we noticed the place wasn't that busy, maybe 25% full if that.  I get it that this location is sort of in a business park so perhaps they'd be less traffic on a Sunday evening but still, it's a family restaurant and while we've all been to many Swiss Chalets you come to expect a certain level of service.  The busiest Swiss Chalet I know of is in Vaughan on the corner of Rutherford and Weston.  That place is packed and it's certainly not usual to have to wait a while to be seated.  Even with that you'd expect that to wait a bit for the food but busy places have a way of keeping things going at a respectable rate.  Our usual location used to be the Queensway at Kipling but I've switched it to Eglinton and Dixie and both those locations are decent otherwise we wouldn't keep going back.  The one on Dixon road by Martin Grove is sort of horrendous.  I don't think I'd go back there again.  I bring up all these other locations because while it's a chain and you do have your standard which you expect to be the service and the food there are differences between them.  This Financial Drive location looks brand spanking newly renovated.  The dining area seems modern and the place actually looks more impressive than some of the older locations.  Granted looks can be deceiving and unfortunately they were.  While our server took our orders she didn't really take care of us I thought.  Drinks were not really looked after, our appetizer came out with the meal and this was all after coming out to tell us because they had a really big take out order, our meals would be delayed.  Our appetizer wasn't brought out sooner to help, nothing was offered to us and we weren't even asked if there was anything they could do in the meantime.    Essentially we'd be told we'd have to wait an extra long time while they take care of others.  Now don't get me wrong I get it that they staff, prep and cook to expectations and perhaps this \"big order\" was an exceptional situation that set back the kitchen but it shouldn't have had really any bearing on the service.  All in all we'd be waiting over an hour for our food after ordering.  That's pretty slow for a place that in reality has limited menu items.  I don't believe anybody ordered ribs so our entire table was either rotisserie chicken or beef plates or sandwiches.    My wife wasn't happy that the appetizer (perogies) weren't brought out earlier and I didn't blame her.  We weren't asked if it was wanted with the main or not.  When my wife said she no longer wanted it when it was brought out the server said she was sorry and that she had thought that my wife wanted it with her main.  I had answered that she had ordered a main.  The server apologized and said she'd take it off the bill.  Later we found out it wasn't taken off the bill but we had to ask for it to be taken off delaying us leaving even.  I had to ask my cousin if it was on the bill and it was.  If she had paid too fast (she paid for everybody) than it would have been missed.  Basically for Swiss Chalet you know what you're getting as far as the food goes for the most part.  You know what to expect right?  Well for the service I'd like to think you also expect the same standard which is to be treated like you matter because you're a customer regardless if you're a regular at a particular location or not.  I didn't get that feeling on this particular evening (Sunday, September 10th).  I can understand that sometimes servers can be overwhelmed.  Honestly this time it didn't seem to be the situation.  The place wasn't that busy and regardless it's not a great feeling to feel like you're completely forgotten about or even worse that our time is forfeit or having the impression that we are being \"handled\" as far as time management or prioritization goes.  I don't believe any customer likes to feel like they simply don't matter or that they're not important.  That's how my entire family felt that day."}
{"text":"Well its Tuesday night and we took advantage of the half price wings and the two can dine special.  Well worth it!  Great service! My partner enjoyed our money saving night with the added bonus of having my charming personality and amazing  conversation as the cake topper!"}
{"text":"We had Sara B. as our server and she was very kind, especially to our son. The place was slammed with lots of customers on a Friday night, right at supper, but we were seated quickly and our drinks and food came very fast. The food was tasty and was also reasonably priced -- a big win when dining as a family. Everyone at the place was really friendly and we were asked several times about how our food was and if we needed anything else. The front door greeter was also really nice and was a friendly and familiar face from the Chalet that used to be on Macleod Trail. We were very happy with our experience and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food's usually half decent but the service is a hit or a miss. Orders are messed up between 40-50% of the time and sometimes the food's cold. The servers are either really good or really bad. You never leave with a empty stomach but the food's usually just average. Still a good place to eat when you feel like comfort food."}
{"text":"Where else does one go for the best restaurant bought chicken soup when sick with a bad cold? Swiss Chalet! $3.99 will get you a bowl! Oh and a whole wheat bun is 29 cents (but fresh)! I cannot taste or smell a thing right now so in we went - first time here. No complaints other than portions are quite small these days, it has been awhile since I have been to Swiss Chalet. Hubby's quarter chicken dinner was more on a scale of a 1/8 chicken dinner. My soup was served nice and hot and it was exactly what I came in here for. They say they make it fresh daily and the texture of the pasta and colour of the soup told me that this appeared to be true. Service was fine, friendly, no complaints and the restaurant not very busy.  Ample parking in the lot. I like Swiss Chalet's ribs and will be back for them I am sure but likely for take-out.  I have also found delivery service at Swiss Chalet in general to be a rip-off."}
{"text":"Day 2 of eating only chicken soup - my sniffer is still broken and I cannot taste squat. Back to another Swiss Chalet, this time we thought we would try and outdo last night's outing at the Country Hills location and come to this Sarcee Trail SC. I struggle to give the place even 2 stars but kudos given for the large interior and cheap food.  Service was pretty bad, waitress interrupting my partner as he spoke and she yanked the menu from his hands after we ordered. The food took longer to come out tonight and my soup was not hot although I asked for it to be. They were out of whole wheat buns - bummer, so no bread for me and they skimped on the crackers. M got the chicken club wrap which did not look too bad but if you want a hot meal, this would not be the choice for you as the chicken is cold inside the wrap. I dunno, it's Swiss Chalet, not somewhere I would cozy up to a nice glass of red or anything but we won't come back to this restaurant in particular (I have bad stomach grumblies...???). I hope to God I can eat something besides soup tomorrow. I do not want to see every Swiss Chalet in Calgary within a week! :)"}
{"text":"Worst Swiss Chalet ever! Super slow service, dry chicken, stale stale bread! Corn is old and dry too. What the heck? Aren't there minimum quality standards required?  Terrible, simply terrible. I wish I checked the Yelp reviews before I came to this location. Who knew it could be so bad.   Btw, an hour after we arrived for dinner, another table ordered only to find out 15 minutes in that they ran out of dark meat chicken! Haha, seriously!"}
{"text":"While the food here is exactly what you'd expect to see out of just any Swiss Chalet the upkeep of this particular restaurant is absolutely horrible.  I have never seen such a horribly untidy chain restaurant ever.  While it was closer to closing time when we arrived (9:20pm), two other groups showed up after us.    The area of the restaurant all the patrons were in was a small 10 table section but this area was just gross.  The table behind us hadn't been cleared, a table in the middle of the section had what seemed to be ALL the plastic cups of the area collected there stacked, the booth we were to sit into while the surface seemed clean, the floor had a used napkin on the ground right in front of us.  The server just kicked it away upon seating us.    Basically all the unused tables around us were filthy and hadn't been cleared with used dishes just sitting there.    The server was kind and friendly but the upkeep of this particular Swiss Chalet was probably the worst I've seen.  I can't believe they'd allow the customers to sit in a section that needed to be cleaned up.  The tables and floors were a mess and it remained that way for our entire meal as I supposed they were just going to clean everything up after closing."}
{"text":"A sad and decrepit establishment. This place obviously needs to be shut down for too many clear cut reasons."}
{"text":"We walked into the Woodbine and Major Mackenzie location and were quickly greeted by the server and seated right away in a large booth seat meant for six people.  I liked that since we were only a party of two, it meant we had so much space to ourselves.  Our two dinner plates arrived very quickly and served with the infamous Chalet sauce too.  My Kick'n Crispy Chicken half chicken dinner included four pieces (a combination of dark and white meat), a choice of two sides (I chose the new Cheddar & Jalapeno mashed potatoes and Caesar salad), coleslaw, a multigrain roll, and of course the Chalet sauce.  The four pieces of chicken were huge!   While the chicken was definitely fried well and crispy, I thought that the crispy skin lacked a little bit of flavour.  I like fried chicken that is seasoned really well so this one was actually decent for the average person but lacked flavouring for me.  (I have high standards for fried chicken XD.)  Also, I thought that while the meat was tender and firm, it wasn't juicy or moist enough for me.  I like fried chicken meet to be really juicy and a little oily and moist inside.  It was still passable though and it did satisfy my fried chicken craving.  The Caesar salad was really good; lots of cheese and dressing and fresh.  The coleslaw wasn't too pickled or sour either.  The Cheddar & Jalapeno mashed potatoes were pretty good and you could taste the jalapeno bits within the mashed potatoes too.  I'm not a fan (and was never) of the chalet sauce.  It was pretty much left untouched by the end of the night.  The multigrain roll was squishy and soft.  The Wings & Rib Combo had 1/3 rack ribs and five wings (mild sauce) which came with one side (Garden Salad) and the coleslaw, roll, and Chalet sauce.  The five wings here were actually so tiny and the mild sauce (as the server recommended it as her fave) were a bit spicy.  They were decent.  I was most impressed that the ribs were indeed fall-off-the-bone and quite tasty.  You did have to chew thoroughly though to break down all the fibers of the meat.  The Garden Salad was also fresh and a good respite between all the meat we were eating.  It was nice to know that Swiss Chalet offered Scene points redemption as well!"}
{"text":"Eating at Swiss Chalet is something I look forward to and even get excited about. The Swiss Chalet in the beaches however was a disappointment last week.  The \"Express\" dining area contained tables filled with trays and garbage that needed to be cleared.   The creamy chicken soup was not creamy. It was opaque, but very watery and unappetizing. It seemed as though the kitchen staff had added extra water to get more milage out of the pot of soup.  Swiss Chalet delivery drivers were milling about in the dining room and hard to maneuver around when leaving.   The chicken on a kaiser was good and the dipping sauce heavenly as usual, but in the end - you can do better Swiss Chalet. I have seen you at your best at other locations and this was weak."}
{"text":"Went here with my parents and had a good meal - half chicken was tasty and the service was quality as well. Although it took a while to get our bill, this is a well run spot with quality food."}
{"text":"I've been enjoying Swiss Chalet for years and I can honestly say it has disappointed me. I mean what's not to love? Chicken, special sauce, and golden fries. I actually know of Americans crossing the border into Ontario for few hours so that they can have Swiss Chalet. Prices are good and the food is wholesome. I would strongly recommend it."}
{"text":"Average food not bad not good.  The outdoor area was the only reason I we stopped and that was nice.  My fish and chips were slightly above but everything else was meh.  The \"ice tea\" was instant and the soup was ok.  Your probably going to get an ok meal here but for the price you have better options."}
{"text":"This location is right on the south east corner of Rutherford and Weston.  It's a full Cara building in that the left half is Harvey's and the right half is Swiss Chalet as they share a common middle entrance.  Out of all the Swiss Chalets I've been to in recent memory this one is the most up to date looking place.  It must have been renovated because it doesn't look like some of the sadder, dreary restaurants out there.  It was quite busy too, very busy for a Saturday evening as it seemed like it was a full house.  We had a big table since it was a family dinner, no special occasion really.  Although we were a large party (9) we didn't really have to wait that long for a table which was about 15 minutes.  The food is pretty standard and this time around I had ordered the half rack of back ribs and 5 wings instead of my usual half chicken dinner.  The wings you are able to get them with different sauce.  They had a Nashville hot sauce promo going on for their regular quarter chicken dinners and I had asked if I could get the wings like that and the server said yes.  While we waited a while for the food which was understandable on a busy evening it finally came out and I had noticed the wings I had were not \"hot\" at all.  I assumed they had put on the wrong sauce because they weren't the correct sauce.  I had let our server now that this wasn't the hot sauce and she offered to give me a new batch and I just said it's ok just to bring me the sauce on the side.  The wings unfortunately seemed cold as not hot (heat hot).    Either way the food was good but I noticed there weren't any wet naps for finger bowls given as Swiss Chalet has done in the past.  When you're eating ribs and sauced wings it's sort of required.  Anyway the service was still ok.  The new mini doughnuts are made fresh however.  They were fresh out of the fryer whether plain or with sugar and cinnamon."}
{"text":"Swiss Chalet use to be one of my favourite places to eat as a child, now I'm disgusted with their policies. This particular location refuses to deliver the food to your door if you live in an apartment. That's great, considering it's delivery and people who live in my building are handicap and elderly. Discrimination at its finest. Every other place I have ever ordered food from has never had a problem coming to the door."}
{"text":"This is the Swiss Chalet that we go to when we have a craving for that sauce and those fries. You know what I mean :) This location is quick, clean, the food is consistent and the service is pleasant.  Like most Canadians I've been to many a Swiss Chalet and I find that this location is one of the best."}
{"text":"Convenient for proximity to Go Station but the 1/4 chicken white meat has been dry and stringy each time I've ordered it. Obviously they leave it sitting around in the storage drawer way too long. Chalet sauce is watery and thin.  Fries are good though and a decent portion given. I won't  bother with this location again as the Upper Middle road location is much much better the chicken is never dry and the chalet sauce is nice and thick."}
{"text":"This Swiss Chalet is located about a major block north of Dixie and Eglinton on the east side in a strip mall that shares with a Greek buffet, some sort of nightclub and a Yuk Yuks comedy club to name but a few businesses.  Just like any other Swiss Chalet the food is just about the same as any other.  Because of this fact there's a few things that differentiate one restaurant from another in my books.    One that is obvious is how the place is laid out and how comfortable it feels.  This place seems more spacious and has a more friendly design than some of the others say like the the one I go to most often on the Queensway or the one on Dixon road by highway 27.  This one just seems brighter and for the dining room the bar seems to be the center piece and it breaks the monotony of making the place feel like an eat in diner at the now defunct Zellers. The place looks better than the average Swiss Chalets I'd go to so that's a plus there.  The facility appears to be clean unlike the horrifying experience I had at the Dixon location.  The next thing I can look at is the service.  The service here is just about the same as the others which is friendly and fast.  I did notice that these days I suppose the finger bowls are a thing of the past.  I get it and it's cool to not necessarily bring those to the table anymore.  Since I had ordered ribs and wings I was at the very least given more napkins and wet naps to use for afterwards.  My wife wanted to try the rotisserie beef on a kaiser bun.  This whole rotisserie beef thing appears that it's here to stay.  I've had it before in the dinner plate version and I did like it.  It's savory and the meat definitely is unmistakable as cooked beef.  It's heavy, hearty and it'll fill you up because it's a solid meal.  With the addition of beef, Swiss Chalet now offers all 3 main meats, chicken as the staple, pork in the form of ribs either side or back and now this rotisserie beef as well... something for everybody that is if you're a meat eater like me.  The last time I went to another Swiss Chalet was just a couple weeks ago in Vaughan and I had asked for the wings to be that Nashville hot and I didn't get that but here in Mississauga I did.  So the last two times I went off board for what I usually do whenever I go to \"Swish\" which is to simply get the half chicken with fries.  Both times I went with the exact same dish at two different locations which was half a rack of back ribs with 5 wings sauced.  For 20 bucks I don't know if I'd get this dish again.  For some reason and I guess it's the way they butcher but I only got 5 ribs (5 bones) for these \"half racks\".  Now while I get it can be 10 to 13 bones for a rack 10 is the low side and 5 bones would be the lowest possible \"half\" you can get.  That's what I received here.  Now the thing is the curved part of the rack (where the bones get smaller and the rib rack actually narrows) is what I received here.  So what I received was the absolute minimum number of what could be considered an acceptable \"half rack\" of pork back ribs but also the smaller, less meaty \"half\" of the rack with the significantly shorter and less meaty bones.  Suffice it to say I don't necessarily want to receive the least possible amount of value for my money.  Secondly the wings... ok so this batch had the proper sauce but generally speaking they don't taste like they're freshly made as they're just not \"hot\" enough.  When I say hot I mean heat hot, not spicy hot.  They simply seemed reheated so that's sort of a turn off.    I suppose the best thing to do when I go to Swish is to go with what I know which is the half chicken dinner.  It's roughly about 12 bucks before tax and it's probably just as filling and it's always made fresh no matter what Swish we seem to go do it's a staple and they're always pumping out chicken so the odds it's not as fresh just seem less likely.  Besides the shortcomings on the ribs and wings, the chicken is pretty much always good to the point that I can't complain about it.  I do like the beef too and the beef on a kaiser is rich and good.  The dipping sauce lubes it nicely and it goes down well.  I may considering making this my new go to Swiss Chalet going forward because it is also close to home just west on the Mississauga side as opposed to the Queensway location on the Etobicoke side but rather south east of where I live."}
{"text":"Swiss Chalet is a Canadian national chain that is owned by Cara who also owns many other Canadian restaurants like Harvey's, Milestones, and Montana's.  As far as location is his my favorite Swiss Chalet to visit because it's close to the highway and although can get busy, is never so full that we have ever had to wait for a seat like the location on Dundas and Shorncliff.  Currently they had a special going for 2 quarter chicken meals, an appetizer and a dessert for 20 dollars.    The appetizer you're sort of limited to only 4 different ones because it can't be more than 6.99 and if you want white meat it's another 1.50 each meal.  We ended up getting it since we usually get quarters anyway.  The food and service is sort of what you would expect to get from any Swiss Chalet.  I can't say that any has ever stood out over another but overall the value is good for the price."}
{"text":"Ask anyone who knows me well, that in my childhood Swiss Chalet was one of my favourite restaurant, and to this day I still like to indulge with one of my vices and comforts.   But something has happened in the land of the Swiss chicken. Maybe I'm wrong but I remembered that my chicken used to come red roasted, plump and just like the pictures.   Look at my photo. I felt I was being fed a poor man's meal. Airplane foo has better presentation than this. Look at the chicken! It looks nothing like the photos.  Inside it was still pink!  The server says all the young chickens (now I know why the portion is teeny tiny) they use will have a little pink in it.  She switched it but gave me some chicken that was sitting on the burner for a while the skin was dry and not juicy. And still pink near the bone.   I don't know what happened to the quality here. And it's not just this location but one in Mississauga I frequent was the same recently. I used to eat all the time there and had no issues.   The service was lacking but they were short staffed. There were tables not cleared and the hostess would disappear after seating people while there tons of empty tables.   I get that SC is a franchise, but it seems like the standard of this one and maybe the company in general is lacking. I don't know if I can given SC another chance? Definitely at another location.   Go to Ichiban next door.   *General comment: In this area, there's really a lack of restaurants worth eating at, in a $$ price point. You either have pizza, bar food or this and Ichiban. I think there is an opportunity here."}
{"text":"Impressed with the menu and what they serve. Compared to the menu of old, the new one is in its own league. However, Swiss Chalet is no longer a \"cheap\" place to eat these days. The double leg dinner use to be $9, then $10. I stopped going and came back to find $12. I can easily buy a Costco, Food Basic or Fresh Co rotisserie chicken for $7.49, and that's a WHOLE chicken. I do understand the need to increase price due to inflation and operations maintenance, but they could also try other tactics to lower price and get more people to come. There are always alternative ways to work around just raising prices.  Onto the actual experience, I'd say I had a pretty good time here. Hostess was very nice and polite, so it was a good start. I ordered the double leg ($12) and fiancé had the rotisserie chicken in kaiser ($10) - DON'T YOU EVER ORDER THE KAISER. She made the worst decision ever.. It was literally chicken and bun. There were no condiments or sauce to go with it or even mixed inside. How can you serve something like that? It's like ordering a big Mac and you don't get the Mac sauce! Will not order that again. What else can I say? Overall experience was a decent one - I will go back.. Someday."}
{"text":"Don't do takeout on a Sunday! As soon as you call,  you jump thru 3 hoops and finally a human, \" you're order will be processed after 11:50...o a takeout.. Make that 12.00. Now after 10 minutes of ring-a-round a rosie'. So what is it you want to order..o shone delivery..now that'll be extra?.., A V O I D"}
{"text":"Worst delivery service I have ever experienced. Order took 1.45 minutes from time of order to my door. Tried calling customer service- and was on hold for twenty minutes. When order finally arrived, missing an item and their debit was out of service. DO NOT ORDER from this location."}
{"text":"One of the better Swiss chalet I've been to. Service was fast, efficient and nice.   Even the manager was walking around and helping.   Will come back!"}
{"text":"A great place for get-together or meeting dates. Highly recommanded to visit during night time."}
{"text":"I ordered a \"12.99 appetizer &quarter chicken& side deal \". Came out to being 15.99+.   Than I waited at the drive through for over 15 mins   And I ask for whole wheat bun.  And they gave me white    AND THE APP WAS AN OILY GROSS SPINACH DIP WITH STALE CHIPS    AND WHEN I WENT CONTACT THEM ON TWITTER THEY IGNORED ME.   disgusting never go there. Swiss chalet is a rip off for how much food you get.   Espically how my family orders from them so often they don't even respond there customer service is repulsive"}
{"text":"We order from here often and I swear they always mess up delivery. They always forget something's it's super annoying. The portions so small, a lady who works for cara came to my school to talk to us and I asked why portions so small... obviously price deductions. It's not worth $12 for a 2 bite chicken. Slap of powder mash potato and a sauce.   Again all cara Operations are   The staff so unhappy and today they served hot pop to us because ice machine was broke.... why isn't it even cold?? and charged us for it what a joke!"}
{"text":"Over-hyped rotisserie chicken. We are all familiar with the ads, jingles, and the rotisserie channel. I fail to see what's so Swiss about it.  I came here because I got coupons by mail. Chicken is bland and not well cooked, I had better rotisserie chicken at multiple grocery stores. Gravy is slightly less meh than KFC's. I ordered the salad with my meal but I wish I got fries instead as the salad was not fresh and very disappointing. Service was quick but I would much rather wait a little longer for a well cooked chicken and a freshly prepared salad.  Feel free to check it out if you have coupons. Personally I would much rather grab a rotisserie chicken from Loblaws along with a bag of salad mix."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a Sunday night dinner with my girlfriend and decided to bring it here because of the limited time chicken parmesan. Once we received our order, it wasn't quite like I expected, tv and picture can make things really deceiving. The chicken was overly breaded for my taste and the linguine portion was quite small. Non the less, still a good meal for a lazy Sunday evening."}
{"text":"I am personally a fan of Swiss Chalet. Why? Because they have seriously changed the portion size and quality of their chicken. A quarter chicken meal almost looks like half the size of what it normally used to be and the worse part is that not only are they giving less, the quality just sucks. The meat is always overcooked and dry. I always have to dip it in the chalet sauce (best thing only at SC) to bring some moisture back into the meat. And not to mention every time I eat Swiss Chalet, my stomach never feels right after. Why do I eat here? Only because I have a few people that still like their chicken."}
{"text":"Either make food right, or make the mistake right. But making food wrong (consistently) and refusing to make it right isn't forgivable. Nor is stating refunds can't be offered for missing product because \"the computers don't allow it.\""}
{"text":"Since we came to Canada, Swiss Chalet has been one of our favourite options for an everyday casual restaurant.  Yes it is a franchise, but if you are in Mississauga this is the one you need to go. We have visited all of them in the area and some of them are just not up to the standard (ie Burnhamthorpe), it is not exactly close and the location is also not very nice but it compensates with the service, friendliness of the staff -pretty diverse as it should be- and of course the food, which it is always very yummy , fresh and portion are enough."}
{"text":"Predicable franchise wasn't quite the case for my simple chicken noodle soup takeout. Food quality was almost at par. Almost because the flavour was consistent with other Swiss Chalets, but appeared as if it was stewing around for a couple of days as the noodles were practically \"melted\" and the chicken scraps were just that.   The second most infuriating aspect was the wait for the prefabricated soup with virtually no lineup. I waited a good 5 minutes before I got my single serving of soup. My buddy who showed up 15 mins later and order just a single serving of soup with no one in line waited over 5 mins. Interesting isn't it?   However, the most infuriating experience was the size of the takeout bowl of soup. For almost $5, it felt like a I got a cup of soup. I questioned the manager about the size, and all he said was this is the size of a bowl. Oh well, lesson learned. Not happy and not likely to return for more punishment."}
{"text":"Like their chicken and ribs! Of course their fresh cut fries aren't bad either. New menu, they now offering some Italian menu items. So, not your father's Swiss Chalet.  Haven't had any bad server's at this location. So, a win win, for the entire family."}
{"text":"Today was a day to drive to the Toronto Zoo but as I headed up the QEW I kept seeing signs for a long departed Buffalo favorite ... THE SWISS CHALET.  Memories came rushing in ... I started to hunger for the dipping sauce and the rotisserie chicken ... Mm mm SWISS CHALET, why oh why did you ever leave Buffalo?  So, lots of zoo walking left a real HUNGER that needed to be satisfied once I cleared the traffic hurdles of one of the world's largest cities.  I knew that I would pull off at the first exit where there was a sign saying SWISS CHALET.  This particular SWISS franchise was chosen completely at random but it was truly a random selection but it was my lucky day because this particular SWISS CHALET not only verified wonderful memories but it also was a restaurant with great service and it was spotlessly clean!  What a great place to eat!!  To me SWISS CHALET has always brought back memories of CHICKEN meals that were great!!!  So, tonight it was all about the bird!  The starter was a small order of wings with SWISS CHALET barbecue sauce to be followed by their homemade chicken soup, and then a quarter chicken with mashed potatoes and a biscuit.  Plus bottomless 7-UP (Another memory brought back!).  This restaurant has a pick up area for those who are having an easy dinner at home that is out of the way from a nicely arranged restaurant.  Having just eaten at a restaurant whose tables were just set out I appreciated the ambiance of this SWISS CHALET.  Five stars does not represent perfection so hidden in the mix was an eh moment, which is appropriately Canadian ey?   The wings .... The wings were tiny and not crispy.  The barbecue sauce had a nice flavor but the wings just didn't do it for me.  However, the homemade chicken soup .... I swear I could hear Barbara Streisand singing MEMMMMRIES because with each spoonful of this delicious soup I was transported back in time more than 30 years.  This is really good homemade chicken soup loaded with chicken!!  My only suggestion to the powers that be at SWISS CHALET ... Skip the pasta or don't cook the soup with the pasta in it because the pasta turns to mush but in this delicious chicken soup there were only a few pieces of mushy pasta so it wasn't a problem (Most kitchens understand that the pasta should be prepared el dente and then added to the soup just before serving.).  The main meal ... GIVE ME THE BIRD!!!  Actually at Swiss Chalet it's all about the sauce!  But, first the bird ... My quarter chicken all white had crispy skin and juicy hot meat.  Of course at THE CHALET you dip and into the sauce it went and I was jumping up and down for joy in my seat (Alright, I was swaying a little bit because if I had jumped up and down the table would have flipped over.) because the blend of tastes was exactly what I remembered from my past eating experiences at Swiss Chalet in Buffalo and now I realize I miss the tastes (Why oh why did they close their Western NY franchises??).  The accompanying roll was a really great tasting roll by itself with some butter on it but oh no this roll was meant to be dunked in the Swiss Chalet Sauce.  Yes, I needed more sauce ... And the very friendly waitress delivered.  I ordered a side of mashed potatoes because I seemed to remember a really yummy gravy and YES BABY I was satisfied again.  But my word of warning for those of you without a longing for past Swiss Chalet mashed potato and gravy experiences ... The gravy is a bit on the salty side but who really gives a CLUCK because you can wash the salt down with your bottomless 7-UP!  Believe me as I drove down the Canadian Expressway back to the States I was watching for SWISS CHALET signs because to me it's worth a trip through customs, a bridge fare, and gas costs to get at this incredible chicken.  And, if you live on my side of the border at least until after the November elections, you get the bonus discount that our currency is still worth more than theirs so the cost of the meal immediately goes down by about 20%.  So, for me with my nostalgic heart there is no doubt that on this night at this randomly selected Swiss Chalet location I experienced FIVE STARS ... Take away the nostalgia and perhaps the grade might slip to four but it was still a meal and dining experience to crow about at a very reasonable price, which is then discounted thanks to our American economic system!"}
{"text":"Yikes!  You might want to avoid this Swiss Chalet location. The place is very dark, dirty and uninviting. To top it all off, the service is insanely slow and you are rolling the dice on what food may arrive at your table.  Oh, and if you need to use the washroom, Don't!"}
{"text":"for the most part, i agree with some people claiming they got weird servers. I was a customer of this swiss back when it was right next to nandos further north on yonge street. ur experience can really be different based on which server u get.  Anyways, food quality is prtty standard for what you would normally get at a swiss. No mishaps on that end. Their side ribs are way better than their back ribs, i will say that.  Pricing has shot up considerably since they moved from their old location. I rmbr when a quarter chicken dinner used to be 6.99 or 7.99. Now it's around $10. Still a solid place for a meal if ur not trying to judge/rate overall experience."}
{"text":"What I liked about this location is the friendly customer service, the waitress was always listening to our questions and was easier to make a decision.  The crispy chicken was great, tender and juicy."}
{"text":"This location is hit or miss with what server you get.  They seem to be too busy to get any real attention.   Taking so much time calling over and tracking down a server for a forgotten item is not my idea of service.     Seems they assign too many tables to one person.  Manager was very good as backup but haven't seen her the past few times I went.  Typical Swiss chalet offering except this time I got a curly black hair with my fries."}
{"text":"They are known for their chicken,  special (sauce), and fries.  Delicious food and amazing service. You can sit and enjoy the food, or take it out. I'm currently on vacation and this is the closest location near where I'm staying,  and I'm so happy I can just walk over and pick up my order."}
{"text":"This is the closest Swiss Chalet to my house so we have ordered take out there a few times.  They pretty much consistently mess up the order.  It is usually something small like forgetting the extra dipping sauce.  My daughter wanted to order Swiss Chalet for her birthday a couple of weeks ago.  While we were eating we noticed they forgot an order of fries and skittles.  I emailed the customer service line twice and both times they advised that someone would follow up.  We have yet to receive  a refund or apology.  Won't be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"My luck for restaurants suck lately! Burnt ribs, dry chicken, gross fries! I am not impressed anymore :( maybe my standards for spending $50 is high but really? Not impressed they are serving dried chicken and this is what Swiss Chalet is known for!! Embarrassed for you!  I tried talking to the manager but he was a useless tit if I'm allowed to write tit lol"}
{"text":"I love you swiss chalet,  but the family wing pack had 5 wings..  for $9 is robbery. They are good. But not that good. I would have just sprung for the extra $2.99 for the 5 other wings had I known what a ridiculous maneuver was at play! Shame on you sneaky Cara Foods! Tsk tsk. I will obvs always order from swiss chalet, but please be more upfront about what my dollar is paying for... 5 wings for $9??? Come on!!!"}
{"text":"People should take example with the customer service provided at Swiss Chalet. This is the 2nd time something unsatisfactory has happened and it was immediately resolved so I can shut up.  Except that I have to tell everyone what happened here.   I ordered pick up online as usual, and when I got the meal, and sat down at my desk starving, I saw that I not only didn't get butter with my baked potato, but ketchup - I also saw that the chicken was half cooked and the skin was barely the crispy famous rotesserie brown.  I started making my comments known on the survey they give me. And within seconds, as I was still looking at the webpage, the manager called me and told me he's going to personally deliver me a new meal!  He shows up in his yellow car at my work and gives me a piping hot new meal.  He said it should be the same order, but I got white bread instead of whole wheat, and Chicken Breast!! (white meat) instead of dark. GRR! I HATE CHICKEN BREAST - why do people insist on feeding this to me?  I digress. The effort from Mario was greatly appreciated, and I hope that all companies can take an example from this."}
{"text":"You know what makes good customer service ? Prompt responses to customer dissatisfaction. Some should take example - this being a large company you think it would be harder to do.   The issue was that their Spicy promotion allows you to spice up your frieds, ribs and chicken with their spicy chipotle powder. When I was at the restaurant, the server told me I could only do this with the fries. I listened to here even though I wanted the chicken too.  When going back to the office, I looked at it again and saw that she misinformed me.   I went to the Swiss Chalet website and since she didn't give the receipt I couldn't comment on their usual, code required survey. Instead I told them the situation over the Contact Us form.   I just said the server requires coaching and this shouldn't happen again to others. I get a call within the from the manager asking me the details of my comment and he said thank you.   A few weeks later, I received in the mail a letter from Cara Operations, head office offering me a gift card to make up for my meal. How nice !"}
{"text":"We hoped this was similar to Boston Market (from the US), but with a bar, It's not. We should have walked out the second we learned there was no drink menu and all they really served was wine & beer.   The chicken is advertised as rotisserie. That cooking style must mean something different in Canada because when I got was in marinated, unseasoned baked dry chicken. I ordered the dark meat and it was still dry. The special sauce they serve with the chicken is especially disgusting. Don't waste your calories. I ordered mashed potatoes and they were powdered... Something was oddly bitter with the gravy. The only way I could swallow the Sahara dessert dry dark meat was to use the gravy as lubricant for my throat. I wanted to cry as this was the worst meal. I barely ate it and the only thing that got me through was to chant aloud, \"food is for nourishment, not enjoyment\".  My boyfriend had the beef with mashed potatoes & vegetable. The beef was too peppery for my liking. It was tender and although not well seasoned, palatable to him (when water with the horseradish). He cleaned his plate because he was starving.   Having dessert was not an option as the meal was so bad, I felt like I am owed an apology from the CEO of Swiss Chalet himself. We ran over to Kelsey's immediately after to cleans out palates with cocktails & dessert. We should have started our meal there. I would not recommend wasting a meal, your time or your palate's integrity here. And I'm gonna stand strong and say any of their locations."}
{"text":"This place is sometimes busy, sometimes half busy.  Families go here for good value,  kid friendliness, and no-risk.  It's an old Swiss Chalet...probably has not changed in over 20 years.  It's fairly dingy, outdated, and very brown.  But it's comfortable, like your parents old basement with fake wood panelling.  The food is pretty standard.   The bathrooms are not great.  They really need updating, and don't appear to be clean.  I would avoid them if possible, but they won't kill you either.  The wait staff, were very good to excllent.  They all seemed to be happy, speedy, and attentive.  I am not sure why, but I'll take it."}
{"text":"Swiss Chalet is Canada's answer to the popular U.S. chicken chain Boston Market.  Located at the corner of Bloor Street East and Huntley Street, at the base of the Greenwin Square shopping center (345 Bloor Street East) and the residential complex (77 Huntley Street), the location in the downtown core area is extremely convenient for those who do not want to travel to other locations that tend to be in the suburbs. Chicken dishes are great and so are the many sides one can chose for their meal. Prices are decent and customer service is great. Feeling more like a family establishment, this restaurant would work well with kids in addition to low-end business lunches. Ordering food via their website is a plus as the chain has demonstrated the need to remain on top of technological advances in e-commerce."}
{"text":"I am disappointed! We are from out of town and wanted to try a Canadian chain! We both ordered wraps which were kind of bland and dry. Not horrible just not great. Our waiter was friendly but basically disappeared after we got our food and didn't come back until we were long ready for the check. Probably would not recommend or be back."}
{"text":"It's one of the inexpensive places with great variety of food.  I'm a regular diner, whenever i don't feel like cooking its time for Swiss Chalet. I enjoy their rotisserie chicken, ribs, beef, shrimps and even tried steak once (it was ok). My wife loves their Chicken Parmesan and the salads. The desserts are good as well.  The facility could do some improvements, the look of it doesn't feel as good as some other locations but the staff is nice. Naeem has been a good server and gave us good suggestions to try.. so now we know what we like at this place.  Would recommend as a casual anytime eating place."}
{"text":"Swiss Chalet has always been my go to place, where the food was always good and at a good price..not anymore. The other day I ordered take out. I had a quater chicken dinner with fries, and chicken pot pie with fries. The fries where dry, almost seemed like they had been re-heated. The chicken pot pie had dried pieces of chicken pieces and the veggies, whatever veggies there was had a rancid like taste..I had to throw it away. I went back to get a refund. They will never see me again."}
{"text":"This Swiss Chalet location is pretty decent compared to a lot other locations in the GTA. The customer service was all right since the waiters can have an attitude or be the ones who attend your needs. In terms of the food, it's decent, something you would expect when you go to any Swiss Chalet location."}
{"text":"Sat down and waited 20 minutes before someone acknowledged us in our seats. Waiters and waitresses kept walking by and ignored us. There were literally three other tables in the restaurant.   At least the food was good."}

Fast Forward next day....Still NO Caesar Salad..WOW Called Customer Service to let them know and Customer Service gives me another $10.00 credit and apologies.

{"text":"Bd location, avoid it, we stopped eating in when the waitress spilled gravy on me, and we have the misfortune of being close enough that they are our delivery store. They screwed up the last 2 orders (forgot the gravy, then the Greek Salad) from now on I'll order pizza."}
{"text":"Before going to a friend's musical performance nearby, we came to this place for dinner. It was the busiest Swiss Chalet I have been to! Lots of people on a weekend evening but that was kinda expected. Place was nicely decorated for Christmas. However I found the lighting a bit too bright and the seating really small if you are sitting in a booth  Service was very friendly. Food came fairly quick after we placed. Overall it was delicious; I did feel the food was prepared in a hurried manner somehow. Chicken and ribs were not bad but roast beef was lukewarm and garlic toast was hard as a rock.  The lady who served us was very sweet and we were in a rush. Therefore we did not bother to address the issues to her. However I was not really impressed with this location. Since there is tons of dining options around, I will probably skip this one next time I am downtown."}
{"text":"UPDATE:  I received an email of an apology from a gentleman the same day I wrote the previous review. He offered apology on the behalf of Swiss Chalet and offered me $20 off on house for my next visit.  I appreciate the gesture. Thank you"}
{"text":"In general I do like Swiss Chalet, but I find the quality of the food at this particular location can be hit or miss.  The last 2 times, a definite miss.  I paid $10 for a plate of wings  that had hardly any meat on them.  The last time was delivery, and I  can't say I have ever been disappointed with  ribs at Swiss Chalet before this time."}
{"text":"Not ever having been to a Swiss Chalet to try their special \"Sauce\" my fiancee was very eager have me discover it. The chicken isn't bad and has a good flavor. We both got a chicken meal with a side of fries and everything was good. The server was polite and knowledgeable, restaurant and bathrooms were clean but the floor leading out of the kitchen into the dining room was a tad slippy.  All in all its a good chicken spot. As far as their special sauce goes. I think it tastes like a sweet and sour sauce, my fiancee and I argue about it...She doesn't think it does."}
{"text":"My daughter and I stopped in for lunch and ordered a Caesar salad and spinach dip to share. Halfway through the salad we found the a ball of black hair. Yes they took it off the bill but appetite killed.  So disgusted I couldn't finish the dip and we left."}
{"text":"Small servings for not that cheap. Delicious sauce as per usual. Meh. Typical Swiss Chalet. Good service here."}
{"text":"Stopped by tonight got 2 -1/4 chicken meals.They told me the power was out lol but the light were on.They said couldnt serve fries only baked potato. Got home potato was old over microwaved,cold not even cut no butter no sour cream no forks no knives no napkins was awful"}
{"text":"I love Swiss Chalet, but this one is not their nicest. They have the old school booths where it feels like you're sharing a table with the people next to you. The decor is also very outdated. The new and renovated Swiss Chalets are much nicer."}
{"text":"I had smoked BBQ ribs with chicken wings and sweet potato, never go back again, the ribs smells so bad,  but the waiter was very nice!"}
{"text":"I like Swiss Chalet, they have really decent food fora good cost. This place has been an institute in this area of Scarborough for as long as I can remember, the service is usually pretty decent, the food is pretty decent. They serve food all year around. i have been here to eat more times than I can remember."}
{"text":"We usually like Swiss Chalet, pretty good for what you pay for, but this locations service is BRUTAL!!! First, we waited 10 minutes for a table when the restaurant was only half full on a Friday night. Our server messed up all 4 orders on our table and had the excuse \"I didn't bring a pen with me hehe\" well if you're not going to remember what we order, you should grab a pen..?!?!?! Then we had our food on the table for another 10 minutes with no cutlery, we asked another server for cutlery and they came back to us saying \"your server will get you some\" like Whaaat???? Why didn't you just quickly grab it?? There was so much more but not even worth typing out. Sorry but if you expect a tip, or return customers you gotta get your stuff together! We'll stick to the Mcleod location"}
{"text":"We went there to use a coupon of dine for 2. I didn't like the chicken flavor and even the sauce. I guess it's my own choice of taste. Also when they ask the preference of meat (white/dark)- i dont see the difference! The server wasn't really attentive with our order. When I chose the spicy chicken flavor, the server assumed that my husband wanted the same and served him spicy chicken as well. We didnt bother saying anything. Anyway, I'll never go back to this place again even with a coupon."}
{"text":"One of the best Swiss Chalet locations out of the ~20 I've been to in Southern Ontario. Consistently great service, recently renovated, and they do a great job with all of the dishes. You'd think that's a given at a huge chain, but I never realized that most Swiss Chalets are actually just okay, not the deliciousness that you find at this and maybe ~5% of its sister locations across the province. Most of them are just okay and many are awful in terms of service and even simple staples like the Quarter Chicken.  Here, the service is great and the chicken is always fresh, juicy, well-cooked, with a delicious and slightly crispy skin. Never been a fan of the fries, but lots of other good sides. The garden and caesar salads are actually quite decent. The cheese perogies are amazing, and the ice cream they serve is well above par--it's real cream-based ice cream, not milk or modified milk ingredients (I know they used Nestle Real Dairy for a while, it seems like they still do)."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst Swiss Chalet in Canada--definitely the worse service, and they manage to fail at the Quarter Chicken too, somehow.  Of the few times I've tried to eat here when left with no other alternatives, I'm usually ignored for 5 minutes at the \"hostess stand\" (never seen anyone staff it...) then I leave. One time I think I got to about 8 minutes of being completely ignored before I left--it wasn't overly busy, and I could see several servers making rounds, many made eye contact with me, but nothing. ???  The few times I've actually been seated after a slightly-less-long wait, the food was awful. Perogies were ICE COLD in the middle and BURNT outside! Quarter chicken is dry and flavourless, burnt to a crisp. Being ignored when waiting for a seat is just the start as the waiters are happy to ignore you until they practically throw the bill at you and begrudgingly allow you the privilege of paying with your card.  I've never once had a halfway decent experience here. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"I know, I know, it is a Swiss Chalet. But it's like the chain restaurant I choose to go to when I am too lazy to think of anything exciting to try. I have always liked SC since I was a kid, despite the fact that their chicken are pigeon-sized. I just love dipping it in the chalet gravy sauce. Asking for extra isn't an issue.  This location is one of the ones I go to often because of convenience. Service here is quicker than some of their other locations. Some are so slow that it took 1 hour for food to come out, it hasn't happened here, so that is plus points.  Recommendations: rotisserie chicken dinner with fries, hot chicken on a kaiser, 4 cheese spinach dip (big, good for sharing), cheese perogies (share), hot fudge brownie sundae and stuffed cinnamon donuts.  The desserts here are obviously commercialized but I dont know any other chain restaurant that serves cheaper desserts. Something sweet to finish your chicken winner dinner.  They also give out free lindors during the holiday seasons and are consistently trying to survive by offering new menu items such as rib or roast beef. Stop doing that. Just stick with chicken and make them bigger!"}
{"text":"I used to order Swiss Chalet on a weekly basis for my staff, the management at this restaurant has changed my routine, after dealing with the management here on resolving a simple issue, I can no longer trust Swiss Chalet. They double charged and lied to me about refunding the additional order. I had to spend several hours and multiple complaints to guest services to get them to clear it up. The issue is still unresolved."}
{"text":"Good service, ok ambience. Food came fast, good prices. My friend's ribs were very dry though. Solid Swiss Chalet."}
{"text":"this place offers HALAL chicken. remember this is only the chicken which is Halal. not the other stuff. their chicken supplier is maple lodge farms in Mississauga.  service is bad. the waiters have an attitude and do not serve you properly."}
{"text":"Me and my husband went to this location after work.The service was so slow we got our drinks after 15 minutes. The food as well came late. They always do this.This will be our last time coming to this location.Very disappointed.I would not recommend anyone to come to this locatiom"}
{"text":"Location - easy to get to Ambiance - ok Smell - restaurant smell at 11am  Friendliness of staff - excellent Server - Katie was excellent Prices - reasonable Dishes bought - all chicken dishes  Taste - excellent Quality - excellent  Presentation -excellent As expected or not - past expectations Bathroom - n/a Overall cleanliness - very good Improvement needed - Katie needs to be commended for her excellent service."}

{"text":"The food at this Swiss Chalet is pretty standard and the same as it is at other locations, however the service at this particular location is incredibly slow. Normally quarter chicken dinners come within about 10 minutes at other locations, however here, I have waited for as long as half an hour.   If you order something like fish and chips, be prepared to wait forever. If you're in a rush, pick a different location."}
{"text":"This has been the worst experience EVER at any Swiss Chalet.  We were 4 people on boxing day.  The restaurant was not very busy so there so be no excuse for the lack of service.  We ordered 4 soups to start off our meal as apps then we ordered our meals.  After about 25 minutes we receive our main dishes and no soup.  I ask where the soup is and the waitress says \"well the soup wasn't ready so I didn't bring it to you\"  Should she not have told us right away and made us decide how we wanted to proceed?  Two of us decided to cancel the soup and the other 2 decided to have the soup with their main course.  When the mains arrived my meal was super COLD and I asked for dark meat and somehow I received white meat.  So my meal was DRY and COLD.  Great mix.  There were NO sauces brought to us prior to receiving our meals or during until we asked.  No butter for our bread.  No bowls with lemon water to clean our hands and to top it all off one of us ordered the festive meal and we had to ask twice for the free chocolates.  Come on Swiss Chalet this should not be happening in ANY of your restaurants no matter what.  Im sure Cara head office would not be impressed."}
{"text":"Ugh I really can't stand the food. In any Swiss chalet location! It's so bland! And boring and extremely over priced! I'm way better off getting a rotisserie chicken at any longos or Cosco and be much happier with a much Juicer and flavourful chicken! I can even get organic for less $$"}
{"text":"You walk in and it's old couples, kids taking their old parents, and retirees eating here. It's just that cozy of a place for me to dub this place \"geriatric central\"  The food isn't bad, for a chain restaurant. Their gravy smothered chicken sandwich has always been consistently good: savory and salty as the gravy is smothered over bread and chicken.  They also have takeout that you can either call ahead or drop by. I wouldn't personally go here for lunch or dinner but would find myself recommending it to anyone wanting to have something \"practical\" and refused to listen to other suggestions."}
{"text":"Swiss Chalet is what it is.. so I will rate by the location, food and staff.  We always come to this location due to ample parking and the staff are always great.  I love seeing staff great the regulars, makes me feel like we are in a small friendly town.   We usually order the spinach dip and chips for our app, but this time decided to try the baked stuff cheese and garlic bread.  O.M.G.... this was absolutely delicious... I wanted to lick the plate clean.  I am still thinking about it... 2 days later.   For my main, I had the chicken parmesan burger.  The chicken was great, but I think the bun wasn't the right choice for this type of burger...  I would have chosen something different to compliment it better.. it was too much bread. My partner had the new garlic chicken special with soup, and that was very tasty and juicy. No complaints there.    All in all..  always enjoy coming here for our share of comfort foods.  It's a classic!"}
{"text":"The problem with this experience wasn't as much the food as it was the restaurant and the staff. I went with a group of 4 and we got the Delightfully buttery garlic cheese loaf, & the chicken spring rolls. For our entree's we all got separate meals. I got the mouth watering Rotisserie beef on a kaiser.This meal was exactly like a UFC main event, the lead up was entertaining and featured a lot of flavour leading to a main event(entree) ending in disappointment, the disappointment with the rotisserie beef was in the fact that it is essentially cuts of meet that taste  like what I can get frozen at no frills, The bun is a tad thin on the bottom, and getting the mushrooms will weigh  down the sandwich to the point of collapse. Flavour wise it has a slight hint of Dijon mustard. But overall the delight is minimal and like a UFC fight is over as fast as it begins. Given that the sandwich falls apart in your hands. As for the washrooms, I read negative reviews about them, and I must say the washrooms are immaculate by truck stop standards... Only this isn't a truck stop, it's a Swiss chalet in a major artery of the city. The toilets should have been better kept, and the garbage bins emptied more frequently"}
{"text":"Ugh, why did I come here?  Coworker and I were sick of all the options around the Yonge-Bloor area and were looking for something economical.  We go out to lunch way too much and been to practically every place, so we went east past Church on Bloor and originally planned for sushi, but then we ended up joking about Swiss Chalet or McDonald's.  Somehow we actually ended up at Swiss Chalet.  I need to just shut my big mouth sometimes.  Atmosphere: 1/5 - this Swiss Chalet looked like an old diner and reminded me of a Golden Griddle.  Yuck.  Service: 3/5 - service was fine and nothing special.  No super service, just some nice women serving us.  Food/price/value: 1/5 - I ordered a chicken sandwich and fries smothered in gravy.  The chicken was alright, but they even didn't even ask the option of white or whole wheat bread.  Are we living in the 90's here?  Where's the whole wheat option? No mention of it.  Also fries tasted terrible unless you smothered them in gravy.  This still costs me almost $12 with tax. My co-worker ordered some type of pasta with chicken and he said it wasn't even what he ordered. He was in a rush and didn't bother telling them.  They asked chicken or shrimp and apparently getting chicken was $2 extra with his pasta. Like seriously, $2 extra for chicken at Swiss Chalet? I thought they were supposed to specialize in chicken. Anyways he ended up paying $18 for very mediocre chicken pasta.    Verdict: I need to shut my big mouth and go with my first instinct.  Would have been happier with McDonald's even though I despise McDonald's.  Dear Swiss Chalet, you are a Canadian company, do Canada better - PLEASE!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place ! It's affordable and close to home. It has a great variety. We have gone there 3 times since dealing with our server from hell. She ignores us every time . No complaints from me...I don't have time for rudeness!"}
{"text":"An update to a previous review: I stand by my previous review for Swiss Chalet as a restaurant chain; however, this specific location suffers from inconsistent service. Some staff are great but many are really awful. Can't decide if it is because they are overworked or just undertrained, but either way it impacts the dining experience at this location."}
{"text":"Order for delivery,with a coupon from the ultimate pack,after 15 they could not honour it because the code did not work,I ask to speak to manager,had to reorder,they pushed it through after another 29 minutes,then apparently the store was having technical difficulties,finally done,ask for the total,it was wrong. Had to wait. Finally gît THE delivery they over charged me again.  Needless to say,this meal was ruined. Thank you again Swiss Chalet."}
{"text":"Wow. We each had a half of chicken and fries. Double chalet sauce. Just like the way it should be done.(like I'm buffalo) Chicken was juicy and tasty, the ft ties were great. The sauce (oh) so good and yes we drank the bottom of the sauce. This was worth the drive. The server was pleasant. We had a great dinner."}
{"text":"My family and I eat here every Friday. The quality is consistently good. You know what to expect at SC; although they just recently changed their Greek salad completely which almost gave me an abrupt heart attack on discovery. It's fairly cheap and affordable for families."}
{"text":"I didn't think my first review was especially negative but it prompted management to contact me to give them another chance.   Hubby and I both had a complimentary 1/4 chicken dinner. White meat for him with rice pilaf and I had the dark meat with steamed veggies, both came with a roll. Both the dark and white meat were juicy and fork tender with a flavorful skin (you can order the chicken without the skin if you want to cut down on the fat). The veggies were tender and the roll crusty but soft. I enjoyed the rice pilaf.  I was watching the different servers interacting with the other customers and noticed that some are naturally warm and friendly, then you have the efficient ones who flash you a quick smile while they go about their business, lastly you have the occasional one who doesn't even crack a smile. The manager did come around to all the customers to see how everyone was doing and she was very pleasant.  I did add a star for the concern and effort of management to improve our dining experience, and the fact that I did find more menu items that I enjoyed. I want to reiterate that the food at this branch is much more flavorful than other Swiss Chalet branches."}
{"text":"I like Swiss chalet because is a good combination between quality, price, service and quantity. I order half breast chicken with fries and was very good."}
{"text":"This is my second time here and the service still sucks. Food is slow. Service is slow. Last time they claim to run out of chicken and waited for an hour. Very disappointing"}
{"text":"I've been here several times. The classic rotisserie chicken seems to have progressively shrunk in size.    Anyway, I wanted to write a review because they have a new offering, their poutines. Tried the Greek one and they are massive! Covered in Swiss chalet sauce, garlic aioli, lemon, chicken and lettuce, they look daunting. Taste wise, they were okay, but the fries got soggy fast. The slight lemon taste was refreshing. However, be careful as the chicken they topped it with still had tendon/muscle. So, it's not the best poutine, but definitely one of the biggest I've seen. They cost approximately $13.75.    Also tried the wings which are petite in size, a bit salty, but has a nice crunch. The dips were tasty, both the ranch and the honey garlic.  Comes in two sizes, ten piece or twenty piece.  Wings are all right, but really small.    Young waitress who served the bar was very nice and accommodating. Some staff from the main restaurant will come by the bar area to watch the game for a bit, I guess for some extended work related tv relaxing benefits.    I also wanted to write this review because of my concern with respect to sanitation. There is a smell.  Washroom is not kept in good condition at all. Rancid smell in there. never had an issue with a Swiss chalet before, except this location. They definitely need to keep their standards higher. They need to clean this place up or I'd have to check out a different location in hopes their sanitary standards are higher."}
{"text":"I know a 2 star is low, but it is what it is.  Made a 6 person reservation for 5:30.  Server was nice and polite, but did forget to \"set\" the table. (put out the wrapped silverware. (not a big deal). Food came fast (which kinda scares me - microwave?).  I know this location is a little tired looking. So...low marks for the location. But lots of parking and easy to get to.  The food is where all the stars were lost. This is prime dinner hour, and my food looked like it had been sitting in a heater for the day.   They had a deal. Buy a Rib meal and get a free piece of chicken. Sounded good.  I ordered a half-back rib combo with fries, coleslaw and a soft drink.  The ribs were old and dry. The sauce was dried out on it. Not good.  I didn't eat the chicken because I wanted it for lunch the next day.  The fries were undercooked. I hate that.   We did order apps - spinch dip and chips. It was on the level of something you'd get at the grocery store. That's not a bad thing. Just very basic.  I didnt see the price as it was a treat, but I'm sure it was not cheap as the rib meals are expensive and someone else opted for it too.  The little things: The wifi did not work properly even though it is promoted. Not sure what was up with it.  Honesly, go the extra 10 minutes to get to the other locations in the area. The Dundas and Shorncliff one was good, and the Royal York and Bloor is much much nicer (given the area)"}
{"text":"My husband and I were driving around aimlessly looking for somewhere to eat when we saw this little Swiss Chalet tucked behind the Keg. We really wanted something hearty and filling but without the expensive price tag. Voila! Thank god for Swiss chalet.   We waited at the front for a looooong time and there was a girl filling up the front food counter but she didn't acknowledge us at all. My husband asked her a question about their hot sauce (I know, So random but he loves his hot sauce) and she had no idea what kind of hot sauce they had. Turns out, it's their in house hot sauce that they use (in case you wanted to know about their hot sauce situation).   Our server was super friendly and even brought my toddler a toy when he seemed restless. She brought him an extra plate and a covered cup with water and a straw. I love it when the servers are so thoughtful!   The  food was pretty mediocre. It came out in 5 minutes, which tells me that it was probably heated up or they had it ready under a heat lamp. Everything kind of felt \"limp\" but it tasted okay so I was cool with it.   Overall, the place seemed clean and it had some cute little Easter decorations. I would come back just because the server was awesome!"}
{"text":"I always get delivery from this location.  The delivery drivers are fantastic.  Hardworking, always with a smile. Now I love fried chicken! But I find that KFC is just too greasy and imho their fries suck.  So I was really happy and excited to try the crispy chicken from Swiss Chalet. In short I loved it! It was very crispy and moist, but not greasy at all.  I hope they add this to the permanent menu.  I would order it all the time. My only disappointment was with the chalet sauce and the French fries.  The chalet sauce was cold.  Not room temperature but cold.  The French fries were cold and hard.  It didn't seem worth making an issue over.  But that is why I only order from Swiss Chalet once or twice a month.  There is always something off. Last month I was shorted 2 of the 4 cans of pop I ordered.  Now they were nice when I called and credited me with 4 cans on my next order (this one). But I don't want to be continually calling and complaining .  That is why they only get 3 stars instead of more."}
{"text":"Hair in my rotisserie chicken sandwich . Gross!!!!! They did replace it with a whispered apology , but they still presented the bill in full. Not what I expect from Swiss chalet."}
{"text":"Chips were delivered freezing . Burger tasted like it was left In Greese for two weeks and heated up.  Never ordering from there again"}
{"text":"Dreadful   Food came warm not hot  Fries tasted old  The beef tasted dry   Their famous chalet sauce is disgusting (my opinion)   Really was the worse meal in Canada so far"}
{"text":"Good food, remember coming here and it wasn't so bad just some minor issues."}
{"text":"So i placed an order for delivery tonight and when they delivery driver got to the door he said his debit machine wasn't working and he had to go to the store first. I asked him if he could leave the food so it wouldn't get cold and he said that he couldn't leave it. he said the drive to the store would only take 5-10 minutes and that the food will still be good when he gets back from the store. I said \"no, that's okay, I'll get a fresh pizza instead\". After the driver left I called the store to complain about the inconvenience and his reply back was \"okay so you don't want the food?\", I said \"well I wanted fresh food\" and he replied back with \"okay then bye\" and hung up the phone. I was shocked that he didn't have anything else to say. It was a bad customer service experience. But if you want good food then think about ordering Domino's because I just got a pizza from there and it was way better that the crap swiss chalet could ever make."}
{"text":"Service = 2 stars at most  When you have to keep tracking your server down to get refills, etc and you can't find them that's not a good experience. Especially when there were only like 5 other families in this huge place dining.  Food =  4 stars  What can I say, I'm an ex-canuck and grew up to the wonderful and unique Swiss Chalet dipping sauce.   This location restaurant is HUGE. Very nice inside, large and new compared to many other locations.   I would dine here again for sure. But I hope the servers get some training before than."}
{"text":"Great place to eat with family and kids, the place is always quiet even when is full. The food is very tasty, my all time favourite are the ribs. The only thing I don't fully like is the attention, both times I went to Swiss Chalet there was only one waiter so the service was a little slow.. but nothing to worry about, you will still receive your orders correctly and the food will be hot when you get it ;)"}
{"text":"Food is serviceable ... Order accuracy and delivery is poor. 75% of the time they send the wrong order, or miss items all together."}
{"text":"Came in on a Friday night for dinner at this swiss chalet location, it was busy so I expect the food to be hot because usually when the restaurant is packed with customers then the food usually comes out hot and maybe fresh. Me and my boyfriend ordered half rib and quarter chicken combo. The chicken slightly salty but the taste was good and hot, on the other hand....ribs were not only cold to the bone but dry as hell, couldn't even finish one before I have to down a cup of water. Anyway, if you come here , the best bet is to order just the chicken. The ribs were so disappointing."}
{"text":"This location is not closed...Went here with a coworker who used to go to Swiss chalet in the States long ago. It was a nostalgia thing more than anything else. That being said, it wasn't bad. I had the beef and she had the chicken. The chalet sauce/gravy is interesting and tasty.  Service was ok, but we got there 30 minutes before closing which may have contributed. My coworker was very happy and recounted stories from 20 years ago about it being a family staple to go to a Swiss chalet and everyone apparently would be wearing Swiss clothing. That is not the case any longer by the way."}
{"text":"My favourite Swiss Chalet location!  I've been going here on average once a week since the store opened and I still love it.    In my opinion, the quarter chicken with fries is still their best option with great value for your money but they have added a lot of good items recently and there are plenty of other excellent dishes they've had for a while.  For example, they have chicken wraps and sandwiches as well as the ribs which are delicious.  While I haven't tried them yet, they also some pastas and prime rib that you might want to try.   In terms of appetizers the chicken soup, perogies, and chicken wings are great and all worth a try.  If you're looking for something sweet, the pecan pie is great as are the mini donuts.   The servers are always fast and nice and the restaurant is clean and still looks pretty new.  Say hello to the owner Dan if you see him,  he's nice and usually around the restaurant.  So overall this is a great location definitely worth trying.  I know I'll be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Service was very friendly. Ordered the burger d cheese and bacon meal with fries. Everything tasted very good and was well worth to reasonable price. Will visit again and would recommend."}
{"text":"Service is fast. Fries are crunchy. Serving size of dark meat chicken (dine-in) is bigger than take-out chicken size. Servers are friendly. This is my go-to Swiss Chalet location.   68 of 100"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time to celebrate Thanksgiving lunch with a couple of my work friends on the Friday before Thanksgiving.  This is the Swiss Chalet that's closest to work, so we picked this one.  On their website, there was no information about a Thanksgiving special, so I was surprised when I found they have a Thanksgiving special when I went, so I was glad they had that.  When we went around 11:45 AM the place was quite empty, but as soon as noontime hit, the place got very busy very quickly. The place is big, and there were lots of seating.  Cleanliness is consistent, restaurant is very cozy. Service is so-so, and the food is great as always."}
{"text":"Came to Swiss chalet on family day. I had the two can dine coupon for 21.99 that came with 2 Quarter Chicken dinners, 1 appy + 1 dessert.  We got the pierogies and cheese cake. Everything was very tasty.   The only thing that I find is; the chicken is always redsish/pink inside. I'm no chef but it looks a little undercooked!"}
{"text":"Both food and service is always great at this location. We've been here several times and have never been disappointed. The one thing that surprised us was that the server knew her 'usual' customers and recognized that we were new to town. Now maybe I'm gullible but hey, I'll take it! My fave is the coconut cream pie, it never disappoints.  I will say that since half of the restaurant has been converted to Harvey's the foot traffic has increased. Which isn't bad for business per se but it is disruptive to seated patrons on the other side. It is quite noisy during lunch and after school with the teens and pre-teens."}
{"text":"Hey, it's Swiss Chalet.  Ribs are hit and miss.  Sometimes great, sometimes not good at all.  Chicken is usually good.  Signature seasoning with Swiss Chalet gravy. Love their fries though, fresh cut.  Good fast comfort food, rarely disappoints"}
{"text":"Got take out from this place.  The take out door is located at an awkward place... you have to walk where the cars exit the drive thru to get to it.  Luckily we went earlier than normal dinner time and did not get run over.  The take out did not take too long.  If you are there for take out, be sure to ask for butter for the buns, ketchup for your fries, forks, knives, and napkins because they do not give them to you.  Swiss Chalet fries are normally not bad but there has got to be a way of not making the fries soggy when having it for take out.  Perhaps they should not have placed it in the same bag as the chicken!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here ever since the restaurant was open a few years ago.  The food is decent but it is Swiss Chalet afterall, so it is not gourmet food by any stretch of imagination. I consider it a small step up from having fast food.  The servers are good most of the time and I don't think we ever have anything big to complaint about this location... or else we wouldn't come back time after time.  Once thing that they never have is hot water in the washrooms, which is odd and quite uncomfortable to be honest.  I don't know if they know or they do it intentionally to save on water heating bills."}
{"text":"as a quasi-American who just moved to Canada, I was craving some turkey on Thanksgiving and decided to give their baked chicken a try. Ok it's not quite turkey but hey! I tried their family pack - a whole baked chicken, half a rack of ribs, 3 packs of fries, cup of corn and chicken wings and everything was fantastic. A team of 2 wiped out the food meant for 4 - it was THAT tasty. Although the ribs are not Texas-great, they are pretty phenomenal for Toronto. And they deliver! Must try place."}
{"text":"Made order by phone.  Seems simple enough.  You would think.  Asked specifically to pay with debit, and the delivery guy came without the debit machine!  Luckily, my friend had cash on hand, but that was honestly an inconvenience.  Might I add that the 'red velvet cake' we ordered tasted more like black forest cake. Just dyed red.  Not ordering from this location again."}
{"text":"First time in a while that I've ordered since they screwed up on our online order.  I ordered today and it was alright but I felt as if the quality has gone down abit. The rice had much left to be desired and the sauce was a little watery.  Oh well, there are plenty of places nowadays where you can order rotisserie chicken."}
{"text":"I gave swiss chalet a lot of chances through my years from age 18 till last month. It was just not satisfying.  I always asked for delivery from Swiss Chalet. And while the amount of serving is massive, I never have the stomach to finish it.  Their food is bland, the sauces and gravies are just disappointing. I don't even blame the branch, I think it's swiss chalet itself is the problem. Their food just doesn't taste all that good!  I recommend people to just go to Cristy's chicken or Mary Brown's, if you're going to get fat off of chicken, you might as well do it with flavour."}
{"text":"Can I give it less than one star? Restaurant screws up every time we have ordered. Don't waste your time here, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This was one of my strangest experiences in a restaurant. We were greeted by a hostess and shown to a booth. I made a quick trip to the washroom and returned to find that my friends had asked for a different booth. I seated myself and took a look at the menu. Minutes went by and then the hostess came to ask us if we had been served. The restaurant was not full, there were 2 servers besides the hostess and maybe 4 tables occupied. Our hostess returned to tell us that she would be our waitress and that she would return when she had her apron and book.  She was very friendly and apologetic. There was a special on for 2 quarter dinners with 1 appetizer and 1 dessert so I opted for that with one of my friends. We waited quite a while and the hostess waitress came back and asked us if we had received our appetizer. She apologized for the delay when we answered in the negative and we could hear her telling the kitchen to make our appetizer a priority. About 5 minutes later the appetizer came and she served it telling us that the rest of our food would be here in less than 3 minutes and to gobble up the appetizer. We were pressed for time so didn't really mind getting everything at once. The rest of the food didn't get there till 10 minutes later and in 2 stages, the salads arrived first and the hot food about 2 minutes later. The food was up to Swiss Chalet standards. We rushed to leave and my friend went to pay but I had to look for the server to tell her to pack up my dessert. I received a blank look and had to remind her of the special. The strange thing is that the other two servers who were working seemed to be dedicated to the few tables that they had. From observation it looked like the hostess was related to the owner/manager who helped serve us. This is the slowest I've ever received food at a Swiss Chalet and the confusion as to who was doing what was very strange. Swiss Chalet is Swiss Chalet so the food is what you expect but the service was the strangest even though the girl who served us was doing her best. The poor organization is what got this the 2 star rating."}
{"text":"one thing that ALL the swiss chalets have in common is: super duper slow service. like why do they need to take so long when fries are not fresh and chicken is rotisserie?? seriously you just cut and serve.   anyways, standard swiss chalet food nothing to comment on. i like their gravy, salty and delish! what made my day was that a 9 year boy next table was asking for a piece of pie for dessert and he's like \"im sharing the pie with my dad, can you pick the biggest piece for us?\" awwww!  p.s. they no longer take the spc card... argh!"}
{"text":"Don't go. I love Swiss Chalet but this outlet served us cold food, had rude service, and high prices. I had the chicken Caesar. The lettuce was mostly wilted, chicken was ok but cold. My dc had the wrap, that was completely cold and when she complained, they tried to microwave it. Total bill $35. Fast food is supposed to be cheap, tasty and fast. This place is none of those."}
{"text":"Never have I ever taken 20 minutes from when I start the paying process to the end. Our server let 1 of us pay and then would go do a bunch of different things before coming back to allow another one of us to pay.  The whole meal was him being rude, ignoring us, rolling his eyes at our requests. It was ridiculous and he seemed to talk down to us because we were all younger and maybe seemed too nice to say anything.   It was a really frustrating experience that we would tell him or ask him something just to have him ignore us and have to ask again 2 mins later.  Bad experience overall."}
{"text":"I was contacted by the owner and he acknowledged my issues. Same as the staff lovely to deal with. Due to the actions of the Owner I will be returning to this venue for food."}
{"text":"Swiss Chalet used to be my boyfriend's all time favourite restaurant, however I've always kinda disliked it. I was even more disappointed to see that they took out fish and chips from their menu. Our server told us the removed all the good items, thats sad to hear that your employees don't even like your food.   I ended up getting the butter hot sauce quarter chicken with seasoned fries and garlic beard. And my boyfriend got the half chicken with a salad and garlic bread as well.   Food quality has gone down, A LOT. Even my boyfriend a proud lover of swiss chalet said not only has the portions gotten a lot smaller but the taste is not there.   I know the fries are the same as New York fries and harvey's not they were not good; they were crispy but not hot. Also the garlic bread it came to me cold, and rock hard. I told our server and she apologized and brought us two new orders of them. You had to eat them quick or else they'll become that rock hard, cold bread again.   I mean Swiss Chalet has been around for a while, and they were good before. But I guess you have to cut corners somewhere to make profit. Our server however she was one point! Giving us great service, too bad the food could not meet that."}
{"text":"HOW TO LOSE A CUSTOMER THE SWISS CHALET WAY - have customer place an order for delivery and have them 1 hr. 10 min. for order - have order arrive with food squished, sauces spilled, food dried out and inedible - have customer call to complain, have order replaced with customer waiting an additional hour for food to arrive - have customer service rep tell customer she will speak to store about credit due to inconvenience and have rep promise to call back customer - have customer service rep not actually call customer back as promised and do nothing about bad service and even wource food."}
{"text":"One of the best Swiss Chalet franchises - and trust me - I've been eating here all my life.  The servers are over the top friendly, and make you feel right at home.  Even the manager came over and asked how my meal was.   They actually care here, even during their busy lunch rush.  Thank you Swiss Chalet!"}
{"text":"Dry, flavorless chicken. Sad they are still trying to ride on that sauce of theirs. Would much rather go to Safeway across the street and buy one of their chickens and a package of dipping sauce I can make in the microwave. Better, more, cheaper. Sorry, swiss chalet, but it's kind of inexcusable to have sub par food in a place like 130 ave where food is at an abundance."}
{"text":"This was possibly the worst Swiss Chalet I've ever been to.  Service was UNBELIEVABLY SLOW! Got here at 1:30pm, ordered by 1:35pm, food doesn't arrive until 2:40pm... 1 hour wait for fast food... Just outrageous!"}
{"text":"The Swiss chalet in Canada is similar to Dennys/ Chili's.  I had the ribs with rotisserie chicken with veggies. It had a decent taste but very commercial. The serving staff offered help from the start and the waitress explained the menu well."}
{"text":"Swiss chalet used to be good. Went in to give it another try cause my buddy didnt want to spend lots at magic spot. Tried the 2 can dine for 15 which is a stupid price if theyre gonna be serving what i recieved. Chicken was horrible tasting, no flavour, my ceasar was disguisting. Tipped my waited 20% because he actually looked after us, feel bad for him to serve such shitty food. Grab some new chefs ya bozos."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favour and order from a different swiss chalet. Its been 2 hours and they still havent arrived. Put me on hold for 10 minutes. Idiots."}
{"text":"Not great, but not actively bad. Just meh. Food was bland, but edible. Staff was not surly, but not overly welcoming, either. I had rotisserie beef, mashed potatoes, stuffing, gravy, and mixed vegetables: broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots. My husband had a pasta dish with chicken. It was all okay, but nothing to write home about. And I have no idea what the little bowls with half an inch of liquid were for."}
{"text":"1/4 Chicken with a side of veggie medley was pretty good but I didn't like the dipping gravy. Not sure what's in it but it didn't taste like chicken gravy."}
{"text":"I never realized how much I missed Swiss Chalet. I love the ambiance. Reminds me of the childhood memories I had here. I liked the dark meat with fries ( they give you more compared to mash )"}
{"text":"I've lower my standard and Swiss Chalet still failed to meet them.   The service was absence in more ways then one (clueless to what we just ordered and hardly around to ask for a refill for drink), most of the food was lack luster (by Swiss Chalet standards). The chicken (the item on which they hang there hat in) was dry. Like surface of the sun dry.   The burgers for the kids where over cooked to the point where it was only a \"burger\" do to the fact it was in-between two buns. The salad was put together with the care for a Bull in a china plate shop.   The only thing redeemable where the ribs. A 7 out of 10. Too bad everything can't ribs.  Seriously I wish everything in the restaurant was ribs, from the people to my drink which needed to be refilled. That took a half an hour to do.   In a word boo! In a paragraph(s) see above."}
{"text":"Everytime I come here, the food is delicious, even the fish and chips. The servers are very friendly. I recently had the chipotle chicken pasta and it was amazing. My boyfriend had to finish my last 2 bites because I was so full. He DEVOURED his half chicken dinner. I feel like people should know that if you order mashed potatoes from most inexpensive restaurants or bars, OF COURSE it's going to be instant. It's a money and time saver. Duh! Get the fries, they're better. Or even a baked potato! I haven't had their take out but it's always better to just go and dine in there. Anyway, 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Visited with my mom and step dad for a quick lunch in the area. They chose Swiss Chalet as they thought it would be decent.  First of all when I walked in, I noticed there were food scraps all over the floor and the restaurant was overall fairly messy. The water glass the server handed me was so dirty, it was gross. I asked her to replace it and she did not look surprised at the state of it. Not a great sign.  Food was ok. Took a very long time to arrive. It also took a really long time for the bill to arrive and I was almost late back to work for a meeting.  Would really suggest going anywhere else if in the area."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery online yesterday. Delivery man was really rude and doesn't speak proper English. I received the wrong soup with no tableware. The quarter chicken I ordered was not fresh and taste wired. Not going to order anything again from swiss chalet."}
{"text":"Roast beef and shrimp was ok as the shrimp tasted very good but roast beef was so-so.   Half rack ribs was quite lukewarm and tasted like microwaved leftovers. The meat was soft and did taste good however it is not better than frozen marinated ribs from big-box stores which you oven-bake at home.   Our orders were around $20+ per person. If you can find buffet places like Dragon Pearl, Dragon Legend or Spoon & Fork in the gta or Wind (if you are in the Niagara Falls area) then you may consider these instead of this Swiss Chalet resto."}
{"text":"We were out in Oshawa checking out the University.  On our way back to Willowdale, we decided to get something to eat.  Driving along Taunton Road we saw Swiss Chalet, so we decided to get lunch there.  It was around 2:20 p.m.  Where we entered,it was the take out and there was no entrance into the restaurant.  It was kind of odd, but we found the main entrance on the south side of the building.  We were seated quite quick, only one other party of 4 was there it seemed.  Very quite and we both ordered the 1/4 chicken.  Mine with mashed potatoes and my partner,  with rice.  We also asked for garlic bread instead of the bread roll, as the bread roll is like eating a rock.  The meal came in a reasonable time and it was delicious. The two complaints were that the garlic bread was hard as a rock, it must have been left over from the lunch crowd two hours ago, and the fact we were seated about 3 tables from where the staff was now having their lunch.  I didn't take much notice but then being in ear shot, hearing about their customer experiences, I did not enjoy that.  The restaurant was pretty well empty, why place customers next to their staff having their meals where we have to listen to their customer complaints??"}
{"text":"Most people complain about the size of the chicken.  It has been the same for a number of years, so complaints haven't changed anything.  It does taste good but from what I have heard, they do add lots of salt under and above the skin.  Not too healthy, but it does taste great.   The waitress was a bit unfriendly and didn't respond to my friend's jokes and didn't engage in any conversation we had with her.  I ordered the quarter chicken dark meat and with mashed potatoes and I mentioned I'd like a slice of garlic bread rather than the \"door stopper\" hard bread roll. I gave a nice tip, but no response."}
{"text":"Whenever we order Swiss Chalet, it is delivered from this location.  The delivery is always prompt, hot, and the order has always been correct.  I don't like the regular bread roll, as it is always hard and not tasty. It would be good for a door stop or a book end though, so I order a slice of the garlic toast instead.  It is soft, with a nice garlic taste, quite delicious.  The 1/4 dark meat, with mashed potatoes that includes the Swiss Chalet Sauce and sauce for the mashed potatoes is always devoured quickly.  My husband orders the same, except instead of mashed potatoes, he orders the vegetables.  He is not fond of the Chalet Sauce, so I finish that up.  For others like myself, you can buy Swiss Chalet Sauce in powdered packages at most grocery stores and there are always some in my cupboard!"}
{"text":"I don't even know.. 2 weeks we have ordered from this lication! And both times our order has been totally wrong! I don't even know how this happens"}

My boyfriend ordered the 1.5 Back Rib combo with dark meat with coleslaw. The coleslaw was excellent! just the write amount of dressing. I ordered the spinach chicken salad with chalet dressing. My chicken was moist and very flavorful. We both shared a side order of French Fries which are always excellent at Swiss Chalet, especially when dipped in their famous Chalet dipping sauce. For desert, we split the pecan pie. Next time, we may just even order 2 slices! it was delicious! (the right amount of sweet after a hearty meal).

{"text":"Ahh swiss chalet a reliable stop for tasty rotisserie chicken, great greasy fries, and decent ribs.  Long a family favorite for takeout, they don't have em on the west coast so when i'm in Toronto I usually try to stop by.  Also this location serves alcohol which is always nice.  The \"world famous chalet sauce\" is basically a mild bland gravy so you should get your chicken with bbq sauce, it's a nice thin tangy sauce and a much better option.  The only reason I can't give them 5 stars is that they no longer have the same rolls from my youth.  They used to have these shiny, butter brushed, super soft , split , toasted dinner rolls that were a perfect way to make your own bbq chicken sliders, but alas they've been replaced with standard dinner rolls so my chalet trips will never be the same"}
{"text":"Here tonight it's unusually busy here but the staff are still there for us and the food was made adequately fast plus tastes great as always. Prices overall as expected vs other restaurants these days so no complaint on my behalf although they did run out dishes somehow lol.   Overall I'm satisfied, came here cuz my parents love their senior special."}
{"text":"Would expect the presentation to be a bit better. I order the chicken parm Sammy with Caesar salad and plate didn't seem full. Would expect more salad to fill the plate more. But main disappointment was the chicken. The actually breaded chicken was not warm at all when I took my first bite. The cheese on top was a bit warm but I assume that was because they put it under the broiler to melt, however, the actual chicken was not warm whatsoever. My boyfriend also got the chicken parm Sammy with fries and he too also said his chicken was not warm whatsoever. Very disappointed and will not eat at Swiss chalet. Food to order should be hot and fresh."}
{"text":"Food was way below par. I don't understand how Swiss Chalet can still be in business. It lacked seasoning, food was dry and tasted old. Had order 2 pounds on wings and the wings were absolutely tiny and dry and deep fried to be completely dried out, and to top it off there was not even enough sauce covering the entire wing. Pesto chicken with pasta was disappointing to say the least. Not enough pesto, chicken was small and dry and pasta had no taste. Customer service was bad, waiter lacked common sense knowledge and experience. Train your employees."}
{"text":"If you ever around the area for a sit down and want some excellent customer service. This is the place, nothing special out of the ordinary. The staffs are friendly and attentive, the menu is huge for different craving, ranging from chicken, ribs with various sides to pick from. Their famous sauce for dipping is perfect for any meats! If you want a quick and relaxing meal, this is the place to be. Always a great spot after shopping at the Markville Mall!"}
{"text":"This place is so corporate. Even the gravy comes with a business card. I visit this place only for 1 reason to keep family peace. It is one of my step-daughter's favourite restaurants, and my wife is pretty partial to it.  So, screwing my courage to the sticking point, a few times a year I venture to Swiss Chalet. What a treat it is to finish the meal and leave. This is not what rotisserie chicken should be.  A quick review of the field would have place the late lamented Kenny Rogers Roasters at the top of the pile of commercial type restaurant. Except Kenny was forced to fold them. Then there was St. Hubert who attempted to conquer Toronto. Now that was good 'dirty' chicken. But alas, they did not last. And more recently the BEST rotisserie chicken was available from Sam's Club, but that too is now gone..gone...gone.  I think that Swiss Chalet must such a degree of influence in the corridors of power in Canada that they are engineering the demise of my favourite rotisserie chicken providers. I think, along with Tim Horton, that they run a parallel government that plies elected officials with intravenous gravy fixes to get their way.  It is not a surprise that the parent company of Swiss Chalet serves a lot of food at Airports. Now they can send their chefs to 'cut their teeth' serving their yummiest gourmet creations, in those venues. I don't know, but I have yet to have had a great airport meal...wait except for Skyline Chili 5 ways in Cincinnati.  And now they are foisting on the unsuspecting hordes, lunches of all you can eat...but thankfully the chicken is not included in that deal! Phew!!!!  Its clean, corporate, staid, dull, noisy, but I go there a few times a year."}
{"text":"So the chicken people have discovered beef now that the price of beef is skyrocketing. So lets offer a roast beef dinner. Who will know any better because our customers only can recognize chicken! The new rotisserie roast beef dinners look mighty fine in the photographs spread all over the restaurant and the menu. To bad they aren't related to whats on the plate. A decent enough amount of thinly sliced fatty beef swimming in ersatz gravy. Bend down close to the plate and you can hear the refrain \"boil in the bag dinner\" The bottomless glass of soda pop is really just an overpriced single serving because the server just can't be bothered! My waitress, walking by my booth, instead of asking how my dinner was, simply walked by with both thumbs up and an inquiring look on her face that reminds me of the stupid blond in the Maxwell House Keurig Pod commercials. To add insult to injury I am invited to complete a 4-6 minute survey on my computer. Their computer is soooo slow the survey takes almost 30 minutes, as long as my meal! For that I get 50% of an appetizer on my next visit. Anybody want the 50% off code: GS103550803!"}
{"text":"This place has no reason to be still open.  The very worse service.  Expect a 2.5 hour dinner because you have to leave the table to find someone.   Close this place down.  Went twice (months apart and sat in different areas ) and got the same treatment."}
{"text":"Came here for take out.  Service was good, food was hot.  Portions were small but overall not as bad as some reviews.    I am not a huge fan of Swiss Chalet (because my roasted chicken is better) but my mother and brother asked for it.  A rare Family dinner get together.  Coupons arrived in the mail the day before so even better.    My baked potato was a little dry and over baked.  But not a big deal.  Family was happy with their meal."}
{"text":"We rarely go to Swiss, but the experience at this location overall was disappointing. First, my wife ordered a healthy option, with a 'vegetable medley.' The vegetables came cold and raw. When I mentioned this, Susan insisted that the vegetables are raw because they are 'fresh.' I pondered if they were fresh from the ice block downstairs or from the microwave? Why would she respond like that instead of saying she would fix the issue? My wife then sat there for quite a bit of time before she got a replacement. When she asked for a diet coke, she brought an iced tea. Why all the hate?  When I asked for utensils for my son who wasn't provided with any, Susan then said 'fork or spoon?' Then she dug into a wicker basket behind us and said 'here is fork.' Not sure where this animosity when coming from. We are good hardworking folk.   Finally, asked for the bill, then waited ten Minutes while Susan seemed to avoid our table I fear of another complaint?  Don't think I'll be heading back there!"}
{"text":"A bit run down , this Swiss Chalet was a bit worn down, with shredded seats, drab interior which was made up for with a good helping of food and excellent service. A sodium lovefest of quarter chicken and roast beef was served with the traditional fixings of fries (a high caloric treat). Notably, the roast is a bit pedestrian and not a specialty, but overall may be worth a try. It may not be as fresh and the taste may be from frozen, but combined with the chicken wasn't too bad.   Service adds the extra star: as it was my wife's birthday (yes a bit cheap for a bday dinner) the servers all came by and sang happy bday with a comped pie and ice cream. What an amazing surprise to cap off a good and relatively inexpensive meal. Highly recommend this location over the Hillcrest Mall in terms of service and quality!"}
{"text":"Took a while to get seated, wasn't busy but just short staffed. Was served by a lovely waitress. She was polite, kind and very courteous. She kept checking on or table to see if we needed anything else. We presented her with a coupon at the beginning and usually wait staff loses interest in you at this point, she remained consistent with her demeanour. Great service, restaurant and food were ok. Would return because of her service."}
{"text":"Orderee pickup and the food was not ready when it said it was and the girl didnt know what she was doing.  I had an apple pie with my order which was clearly just taken out of the fridge/freezer . It wasnt warmed up or anything"}
{"text":"The food was OK, the service was not bad but entertaingly not good.  Allow me to expand my story.  Our waiter, Sam, was friendly, but, possibly slightly absent-minded.  My friend's drink was given to me, and vice-versa.  My friend's meal was given to me, and vice-versa.  The napkins my friend asked for were put in front of me.  Our check and credit card was taken to the back, orders were taken from some tables and delivered to others, and about 8 minutes later Sam looked at our table, had an \"oh crap!\" look on his face, and brought our check.  Honestly, nice guy, just a little absent-minded.  We tipped 20%, just for the fact that we were laughing (not at him, just at the situation.)  Oh yeah, good chicken!"}
{"text":"I literally ate at this place once a week for two years. Never had any problems with the food or service. Food was always made fast and got what I ordered.   Swiss Chalet's Double leg dinner can't be beat. The fries, sauce, chicken and buns are always perfect. This meal doesn't just taste amazing but it leaves you full and satisfied. Plus a great price.  I would eat Swiss Chalet everyday if i could."}
{"text":"The introduction of Rotisserie Beef Brisket to the menu was both a surprise and a departure from their usual chicken or ribs offering. I had to try it, so I ordered the 7 oz and subbed the potato out for a salad.   The beef was pretty good, a lot like eating a beef dip sandwich without he bun. Veggies on the plate were the usual, a bit soggy and flavour challenged.   For $15 it's a bit pricey, but a good alternate if you don't want chicken."}
{"text":"Cara Foods, the caterer to Air Canada owns great restaurants but Swiss Chalet is not one of them. I recall the chicken here being tender, moist, and good. Lately, it has been dry, emaciated and unimpressive.   Sure, it is not Milestone's but lately it is not even KFC. My Quarter Chicken dinner was dry and surprisingly crunchy--either it had been under the heat lamps for a long tanning session, or made an appearance from yesterday's service.   Mary Brown's is across the street, and is both consistently better and less expensive, if you don't mind deep fried versus rotisserie grilled. Based on this meal, Mary is my girl."}
{"text":"Busy place on a holiday. Excellent service. Servers are so busy but would never forget your order."}
{"text":"Twice in one week? This time we ordered it for lunch at work. I used the online ordering system for the first time and my order was delivered from this location.  I was really quite pleased that my order was accurate and delivered on time. This time I tried the Rotisserie Chicken Club Wrap with fries. It was really good however, I think next time I'll opt for a salad of some-sort, the fries were a little too much. I was surprised at how filling the wrap was. Quite delicious."}
{"text":"The good thing about Swiss Chalet is, there's very little variance between restaurants. The service is quick and the food is good. What more do you need?  I happen to love their chicken and their ribs but on this night, I had a 'two can dine for $14.99' coupon for their chicken dinner.  The restaurant is clean and well laid out and the service we received was great. I would have preferred the skin on my chicken to be a tad more roasted but it didn't suffer in flavour.  Just a side note: I guess since we're close to Thanksgiving, they were also offering Pumpkin Pie with Whipped Cream for $4.49 and Butternut Squash Soup for @2.99... they both looked delicious!   Every year I look forward to the festive meal with stuffing and cranberry sauce but I wasn't aware that they offered these treats at Thanksgiving. Huh."}
{"text":"I felt it was time for an update considering that I eat in at this restaurant far more than I use the drive-thru.  The service we receive from the wait staff is nothing short of excellent. They're quick, efficient and accurate. The quality of food is consistent and always delicious.  There are many things I love about Swiss Chalet but I have to say, the one thing that really stands out is that they have the nutritional information all laid out in a pamphlet that you can pick up as soon as you walk in (it's right near the podium where you wait to be seated).  I believe it was recently passed that all restaurants with 10 or more locations will have now have to provide this information but I really like the fact that Swiss Chalet is ahead of the curve."}
{"text":"This is the Swiss Chalet that we typical go to since it's the closest to us. Of course we had to get in at least one more Festive Special before the holidays were over so we stopped in here the other night.  I had completed a survey from one of the orders I placed for work and was given a code for a free soup, salad or perogies. We opted for the perogies.  They were served with a cajun style dipping sauce that, quite honestly, provided all the flavour. The perogies themselves were just cheese filled (or so it seemed... definitely more cheese than potato though) and were rather bland. I don't think it's a dish I'd order if I had to pay for it.  Although I have to say, I learned a very important lesson this evening... I DO NOT have room for perogies AND a Festive Special!!! Ugh.  The Festive Special was as good as any other Swiss Chalet but I think what makes this restaurant stand out above all other Swiss Chalet's is the service. The wait staff are fantastic."}
{"text":"Came in for some takeout.  The takeout line is actually at the Harvey's attached to the sit-down section of Swiss Chalet.  Got the family meal thing - which is a pretty good deal compared to getting four quarter-chickens.  The floor was excessively sticky throughout, though no issues with ordering.  It came quick, but the fries were cold and hard, and the chicken as usual was excessively salty.  Food quality really needs to be addressed.. Definitely a meh experience."}
{"text":"I've had my fair share of Swish over the years and this is a good spot.  My fav is the chicken soup and it's really good here. The staff are nice and friendly so that always helps.  Not all swish's are like this."}
{"text":"I like this Swiss location.  The food is like any other Swiss but the service was top notch.  I've been to others where the service wasn't great but I was impressed with this one.  Coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Went to Swiss Chalet for a last minute dinner with the fam. I dislike this location as I find the waitress's to look grumpy like they hate their job. I avoid this location at all costs but one time I came here and had surprisingly good service so we just sucked it up and went to this location because it was more convenient. We got there and it the temperature seemed a bit cold and it also was fairly empty. Our waitress Grumpy Grumps, came over and didn't crack a smile and dropped our menus. She may have muttered \"hi\" but I felt like I was inconveniencing her.  We ordered our meals and I asked for extra sauce but she never brought the extra sauce when she delivered our meals. I figured I'd just ask when she comes to check up on us. She never ended up checking on us and even though there was only about 5 guests in the whole restaurant along with other waitress's she never asked how we were with our meals. I already sopped up my fries with gravy and was waiting to get her attention but she was pre-occupied. So, I had to walk over and ask her if I could get more sauce. Again, I was apprehensive in asing because her demeanor seemed like I was bothering her.  The chicken was ok but it didn't taste that fresh and the fries were not golden but more pale and soft instead of crispy. The best part of the meal was the coffee  and toffee caramel sponge cake.  This was more of a \"Always so 'Meh' for so Little\" experience"}
{"text":"Swiss Chalet has upped their game!   They have some awesome new stuff on the menu that I unfortunately never tried but do plan to once I go back. They now have spinach and artichoke dip (and I'm a huge fan of that everywhere else)!  My boyfriend and I ordered the two quarter white chickens with fries. The portions were big and the price is affordable. Even the wine is reasonably priced per glass. I usually try to not eat all my fries but they were so fresh and delicious I ate them all!  Clean environment and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Very disappointing meal in deed, my chicken was undercooked ribs were tough. Told the waitress that my chicken was undercooked, she agreed right away and sent the manager over, then we noticed my wife's chicken was undercooked the manager argued with us saying it was cooked and we were wrong. Being in foods for 25 years I am pretty certain what under cooked Chicken looks like, they did Comp our meals, But having to argue it's ridiculous never going again. When your restaurant has made a mistake apologize make it right and move on. Never ever blatantly tell the customer they are wrong it was bleeding ridiculous. Just to add I went on and found 2 inspection reports that show they have been noted about taking accurate temps at this location. I have since filed a formal complaint with The Peel Board of Health about this location, I feel this had to be done before someone gets really sick"}
{"text":"Went for my birthday to Swiss chalet and I got my dessert free ,the staff was very nice and sang for me. It is always a good experience when I come to this location. The staff was  very attentive and like always enjoyed so much.Thank you for the free dessert."}
{"text":"Poor service. Slow to clear tables behind us. Washrooms look rundown and were out of paper towel."}
{"text":"This Swiss Chalet location is usually my go to place when I am just not hungry for Dufferin Malls food court choices. Today I so happened to not be hungry for anything at the mall food court and so opted to come to Swiss Chalet with my sister and see if the Quarter Chicken Dinner would suffice. When we arrived there wasn't anybody at the hostess stand for about 3-4 minutes. The hostess finally arrived and we were lucky enough to get a booth for two. After browsing the menu and seeing they had new fried chicken options I decided I would give the fried chicken on a kaiser a try. This sandwich came with a fried chicken breast, lettuce, tomato, fried french fries that were fried into chips and a pesto mayo. Our server took 15 minutes to get to our table and get our order. I opted for no pesto-mayo as again..I am THEE plain jane! Time went by and our server popped by our table after 10 minutes to let us know the pop machine was leaking and she would be by with our drinks soon. Not a problem for us!  30 minutes passed and our drinks came...tasting like water and the flattest pop of life possible. After 10 more minutes of contemplating just getting water, asking for another round of drinks and watching others taste their pop and wait for their disgust face as well - our food arrived.   We asked for two new pops in which our server was kind enough to replace as she was understanding that they may be flat still. My chicken sandwich wasn't terrible however the french fries shaved into chips were a little weird and overwhelming with my already side of fries. At first I thought it came with bacon and I kept looking for it however I couldn't find any. The funny thing about my sandwich was that it was a chicken breast sliced in the middle so when I flipped my burger over to eat it, I could see that my chicken breast was sliced which made for a very interesting and funny concept of a fries chicken sandwich (I took a pic but it didn't save! shucks!) Once we were done our server came by and took our plates asked if we wanted dessert and then immediately went to grab our bill.  We didn't get our little jars with warm water and tiny pieces of lemon to wash off our hands, there was no little candy at the end with our bill which was disappointing. I can see that this location has a high turnover rate because their are always new servers and hostesses, they also don't seem to schedule a lot of servers which can leave service to be awfully slow and lack the customer interaction you would get at other restaurants. I don't think that there should only be 2 servers for the entire restaurant working at a time. It not only overworks the servers but the little touches that make the experience at Swiss Chalet end up being missed.   I probably will return to this location however I know what to expect when I come here.."}
{"text":"This Swiss Chalet location is actually an express location and although I have reviewed a restaurant location before and gave them a poor review this review will be the complete opposite. First off..I can't believe that an \"express\" restaurant has provided some of the freshest Swiss Chalet I have ever ate. The chicken is always moist, the fries ALWAYS fresh and even the sauce tastes better. Maybe it's because the menu isn't as extensive and maybe it's because they don't have to plate anything, but this location is the absolute best Swiss Chalet location hands down.   The cashiers are very friendly, I ordered just fries today and was surprised to see it came with their dipping sauce on the side (extra bonus). The wait wasn't all that bad either as I have purchased fries from Harveys just two kiosks down and have had to wait 10-12 minutes just to get fries.   I truly recommend this location if you want a healthier choice and some very fresh food."}
{"text":"Waiter was not helpful. Food unsatisfactory.. If you are in downtown Toronto, there are many different (and better) options to choose from IMO"}
{"text":"Swiss Chalet is Swiss Chalet you know what the chicken tastes like you know what the gravy tastes like you know what the bomb fries taste like my problem with this location is the wait is very long I never dine in it's always take out or drive-thru and I'll be sitting in the Drive-Thru forever waiting for my food that's the only complaint I have with them their taste is consistent with all other Swiss chalets and the food is always hot and fresh"}
{"text":"Never been to Swiss Chalet in 6 years and finally ended up here on a Friday night and surprise surprise the service was pretty much the same as 6 years ago which was horrible. Greeters don't greet, just stare at you until you ask to be seated. After finally sitting down, we waited another 39 mins on a slow evening to be ask what we wanted on the menu which was ridiculous. Only great part of the night was the Swiss chalet secret sauce and the diet coke I long waited to have."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to a Swiss Chalet in a long while, and after eating here with a friend, I can see why. There were hardly any vegetarian options, and not being that hungry, I opted to get the cheese perogie starters. The insides were very bland in taste, but there was so much paprika on the outside shells, the balance was so off! However, the pesto pasta that my friend got came in a hefty portion, and he said that it was filling.   In terms of service, our server was unfriendly; she was very unhelpful with the menu, and seemed to be confused by the questions I asked about the dishes. Additionally, it took a good 10 minutes to get her attention when we were ready for the bill. She was inattentive, which dulled the experience for both my friend and I.  Verdict: Personally will not be coming back, but there are quite a few options for omnivores!"}
{"text":"Went there tonight 7pm not that busy, hostesses brought me to my seat, sat there for 10 minutes waitress focused on table next to me visited them 3 times. I got up a left. When to Boston pizza. Never again."}
{"text":"Food is hit or miss. Staff are Nice. needs to be a bit cleaner. But it is an okay place to go if you are looking for a place to eat."}
{"text":"Working offsite and away from your usual area food options can be generic or strictly limited.  For the most part our group of coworkers decided to choose swiss chalet, and with the cold snowy weather....for some reason our thoughts were in sync when deciding on a food option. thankfully Swiss Chalet came to the rescue, the place is very clean, the staff was very attentive....how do i know...... I asked for Lime with my water and voila! there was lime, most people just bring lemon. lol...  Onto the fares! keeping it light and healthy I opted to try their Rotisserie spinach salad with mandarin oranges.  Firstly, the presentation was bang on beautiful ;) the portions were more than enough.  At first it can be overwhelming, but again its salad :)  this salad is an overal 4/5, since the oranges were not too sweet, however the vinegarette served did add more sweetness to the dish."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've come to Swiss Chalet, so my family made an objective to come to a newer location in Markham for Saturday night's dinner.   The place is brand spanking new! clean, comfy, spacious and well planned out with plenty of booths, and tables.  Our server was very friendly, helpful, and attentative to our requests.  The menu overall looked the same with a few added things to their menu.    Rather than their usual half rotisserie chicken I opted for their BBQ rotisserie served in a flat bread with garden salad served with a raspberry vinegarette dressing.  The overall presentation was satisfying, and the portions were enough.  The only drawback being my flatbread was slightly burnt, nonetheless the meal was overall satisfying.  The portions are always more than enough, and as most of us know, there's always room for swiss chalet fries..yum.   Swiss Chalet has continually been consistent in its food and service....and hey if you're ever hungry after your meal, you can always hop onto the otherside of the building where Harvey's is lol."}
{"text":"I'm going to give this location a middle-of-the-road rating because of a slight lack of consistency from other locations. Sometimes the chicken tastes under-flavored and the skin is a little under-done. Still good, but you'd consider it an off visit. Considering the fact that the prices are not inexpensive at Swiss Chalet, if you're willing to pay for what you get, you should get what you know and expect every time."}
{"text":"The food is fairly consistent for Swiss Chalet but the service is very obviously lacking. It is immediately and constantly apparent that the staff couldn't care less."}
{"text":"The first table we sat down at had a greasy floor. So we asked to change tables. The new table had sause like splatters on the window. Not good at cleaning. Apart from the window. The service was not bad, but the staff was friendly.   I got 10 hotwings and they came in different flavours, but the server did not ask what flavour I would like. So I was given really spicy ones. The server assumed I wanted \"hot\" hotwings when i sayed \" 10 hotwings\" After we were all done I wanted to pack up my wing I didn't eat, our server told us \"I will get you a box\"  sayed that 3 times before we ask another server for a box."}
{"text":"I've never really been a fan of Swiss Chalet, but moreso because of the portions. The food isn't that great, but the it's rotisserie chicken, as long as it's not too dry it can't be too wrong.  Been here many times but usually I get takeout. Takeout is pretty fast.  I don't understand why the white meat is more expensive than the dark meat. It comes from the same chicken, the cost of the chicken is a standard price. They cut up the same chicken.  They have these new pasta dishes, not that great. It's bland.  Stick with the rotisserie chicken, it's not that big so I usually get double leg for dinner and a quarter chicken for lunch.  Why this is a 2star, the service wasn't that great. They were understaffed for lunch; had to wait multiple times for the bill. Got awkward conversation from the waitress."}
{"text":"Terrible service. No one greeted us and waited several minutes to be seated.  The place was empty.  First thing I hear from the waitress is \"what do you want\".  Upon taking the tables order the rude waitress turns her back on me and walks away, as I looked to the menu to point to want I wanted.    Disrespect rude staff that are lazy and uninspiring over priced food.  Save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"The only thing I've ever gotten is the West Coast salad, and it's pretty good.  Nothing special, but it seems healthy and tasty.  It is a little on the pricey side for a salad (~$13), but I haven't found any place better yet.  I like how they package it, so it's great to-go.  Service is always good; I always get take-out."}
{"text":"I just left the line up at this Swiss Chalet because I was asked $18 for a chicken wrap!!! It's outrageous, and I spent my money elsewhere. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Not used to dining in. The portion for the quarter chicken of my companions actually seemed smaller but it may just be an illusion as the food was on an actual plate than a takeout box. I ordered the 1/3 rack rib and 5 wings plate with a side of poutine (extra $1.99). The ribs were good. Fries weren't as crispy as I had liked and the whole plate just seemed microwaved. A bit disappointed as it was only around 5:30pm."}
{"text":"Was excited to visit the place n the menu also looked exciting . After we got our order we were disappointed as the food was dry n portions were small . Doing more research online gave us the insight that the food comes semi cooked from the base kitchen in frozen state and they finish the cooking here . Lacks freshness ! The concept would be a hit if they cook at site !"}
{"text":"Tonight was the third time I have eaten here and the third time I have not enjoyed the meal. Tonight I ordered a 1/4 chicken, white meat with baked potato. Easy right?   After waiting 1/2 an hour I received a 1/4 chicken dark meat. When I moved the skin back, the chicken was not cooked. Trying to get the attention of the waiter was difficult. He finally took the plate back, replaced it with the white meat, which I had originally ordered, and new potato. Now I had no fork or knife. Had a further wait for cutlery.    This time I will not be back. No fourth chance!!!!"}
{"text":"Just visited the takeout at this location. Excellent customer service. Thanks to Jenna and the manager Patrick for outstanding service."}
{"text":"This not a reflection of any specific location or even of the food or service ive ever received at any of the numerous toronto locations i have been in my life but rather a scathing review of the phone ordering system. CaraCara corporation you plainly SUCK! Your policies and cheap money hungry owners are ruining the simple joys of eating out. You push and push towards an online or app ordering system so you can get rid of the call center but then your app and online ordering system are the worst. I just wanted to pay for and have food delivered to my sick mom who lives 1.5 hrs away from me on a worknight.....i was told no. First the app would not let me order and then your phone agent would not allow me to pay for the meal over the phone like any other takeout place would. The call itself was extremely frustrating and painful and in the end i cancelled my order. Sad to say but youve lost a long time customer over stupid policies that protect no one but your corporation and your owners bottom line."}
{"text":"Went to this location on a Friday night with the family. Ordered the quarter white chicken with fries. The food came pretty quickly however if was mediocre. The chicken was dry, and the fries were somewhat overcooked, and it seemed as though there were small pieces of fries on the bottom of the plate covered with a few whole fries.  This didn't make any sense?? Really felt ripped off with the fries. The chalet sauce was lukewarm.  I was really disappointed with the food.  Bottom line quality of food is not good.   Now moving onto the service, very very poor quality of service. What is the manager/owner thinking when he hired some of these people, does he want to lose business? The server was an older lady, it almost felt as though we were a burden to serve. Had to remind her twice to bring us water. Then she reminded us that they would be closing soon!! I thought then why the heck did your hostess seat us? We still tipped her, but she didn't deserve it. THE SERVICE HERE WAS APPALLING!! My advice to the owner: Hire better servers and staff, especially if you want your business to last, restaurants are popping up around every corner and you have to be competitive with your quality of food and service, or kiss your business goodbye!!  The place wasn't very clean either, pieces of food on the floor and seats,  I used the bathroom there and it was freezing cold, not sure if they are trying to save on electricity or what??  Really not worth the $55 bucks we paid for 4 people. I would NOT recommend this restaurant, save your money go somewhere that actually deserves your business."}
{"text":"Got my Swiss on at lunch.  For about $10 you can get a quarter chicken with a side and a roll.  Its decent food for a decent price.  People rave about the chalet sauce..but  personally never got why people like it....I don't mind it..but I certainly don't crave it.  They have some new items on the menu- some pasta dishes..which I haven't tried.  They also had some butter chicken dish which I tried before and wasn't impressed...but after all whatdo you expect from Swiss Chalet.  It felt like they just shredded their chicken and dunked it into Patak's butter chicken sauce.   Every once in awhile I satisfy my craving here...and that is god enough for me."}
{"text":"Came here with family friends I ordered 1/4 dark meat chicken. The food was average. However, our waitress was super duper annoying. Its not like her services suck, she was okay but she was very disruptive. She kept cutting off our conversations more than 3 times. I can totally understand she wanted to make sure the food and everything was okay it is fine asking for the first time.  When I was still eating and talking she came again asked if I was done?!! Helloooo could you not see i was still eating? Finally I was done and she came again asked if we wanted dessert, again cutting us off during our conversations.. we declined desserts and she cleaned the table I was hoping she could just leave us alone..BUT NOOOOOO she came back right away with bills and asked how we would like to pay. The restaurant was empty I could understand if it was busy but it was not.   She was just very annoying, we definitely did not enjoy our lunch there it was very annoying."}
{"text":"A - List. Recommended. Best priced dinners in the city. Service is prompt and friendly. This place is a bargain."}
{"text":"A - List. Recommended. In the bargain category Swiss Chalet does it better than most. Great Food, Refreshing Beer In Cold Glasses, Friendly, accurate, attentive and prompt service. The premise is new, clean and bright. For bargain hunters, this is among the best sit-down meal service you will find anywhere in Calgary. Parking is tight. You may want to park in an adjacent lot. The walk will do you good."}
{"text":"Walked in on a Monday evening with 3 work colleagues we should have realized by the empty parking lot some thing was up. Ordered our beer, that came fast. Ordered our supper chicken and ribs their specialty. It took an hour to get our dry chicken, and fatty ribs.   Never again"}
{"text":"This Swiss Chalet is tucked into an office building in Hoggs Hollow just north of the subway. It's a decent restaurant. The parking is mainly underground and really awkward--narrow with sharp turns. Other than that, it's a Swiss Chalet."}
{"text":"The chicken and ribs were pretty tasty yesterday. However, the server initially served me cold mushed potato that I didn't satisfy, but she switched a hot one after. Overall, the experience for me was average."}
{"text":"I wanted Swiss Chalet and knew that there was one on the corner of Spadina / Bloor. Little did I know that when I walked in - it was mainly a take-out delivery spot with 3 high top chairs for quick eating. Didn't matter, I was getting take out anyway.  I'm not lying when I tell you I LOVE SWISS CHALET. It is my go-to comfort food and it is always consistent every time. It's been quite some time since I last ate it but I had no doubt that it would not disappoint. Sadly - my expectations were a whee bit high.. both on the food and the service.  There was no one at the counter when I walked in and waited several minutes before anyone showed up. I was watching the cook in the back as he continued to prepare his next order leaving for delivery. The girl was super nice and efficient but I had gotten a little impatient. The store smelled of major BO which made me want to leave as quickly as possible and the space was run down and dirty.  When I finally got home and hoped to enjoy the awesome quarter chicken dinner, I found that the white meat was rather dry, than the usual juiciness, even if it was white meat. The corn (side dish) was also dry, and over cooked - pretty sure it was microwaved. Surprisingly, the chalet sauce seemed rather salty (maybe it's just my tastebuds), but overall... a sub par dinner that I had high hopes for.  Maybe it's time to stick with dine in and dark meat........and ribs next time :)"}
{"text":"I will preface this by saying, this review represents this particular location and not the chain, as I generally enjoy the occasional Swiss Chalet order quite a bit.  That said I will never, ever, order Swiss Chalet again while this is the location serving my area.  My wife is vegan and so we ordered their Vegetarian Burger for her, and the Chicken and 1/3 Rack of Ribs for me.  After ordering online I realized that my phone number was not current and so I called customer service to update the number.  Customer service indicated that the number had been updated and they would call the restaurant.  About an hour later the delivery girl arrived, and the poor girl had the wrong number, our unit is not numbered and she actually managed to track us down still, so we of course gave her a reasonable ($8) tip for the trouble.  I excitedly unpack my food and think, mmm chicken and ribs while my wife goes to get her burger ready for consumption.  The party pretty much ends there, not only is the burger beef, and not only did customer service fail to update the number, but after eating the ribs, the chicken, and some of my french fries, I break open my dinner roll and the accompanying sauce to dip said roll and find not the usual yummy sauce, but this jello like substance posing as a dipping sauce.  I called customer service, and ended up receiving a $12 credit for the mixed up order, but I was so furious that we decided to order from elsewhere for her.  Fast forward about 6 or 7 hours, and I am sick as a dog in the bathroom, I mean seriously I couldn't decide which end to put on the toilet, it was that bad.  The next day, more of the same.  I am so put off of this restaurant (location) that merely walking past it makes me dry heave.  I give this restaurant the, I'd rather eat what comes out of my dogs butt award."}
{"text":"Our regular office birthday lunch place.   The small chicken pieces are dried. The gravy is a thick, velvety coat of regret. The roast beef sandwich was a mistake.  But it's nearby and the people love it. Who am I to dissent to a rather fun, colleague time?"}
{"text":"Verbal assurance from the manager that all the Chicken is Halal, except for the wings. I tried the chicken dinner special with came with a chicken leg & thigh, fries and chicken soup (or salad) with a bun. I also tried the sweet potato mash on the side. Everything was very good. Our server was a little slow (I think she was new), but other than that it was a very good experience with good food."}
{"text":"Not the first time dined here but this time disappointed me. I ordered rice with shrimp and quarter chicken. The portion was smaller than usual. Chicken was dry and not very flavoured. Shrimp was a little spicy. And that was it. No flavour lunch."}
{"text":"I have to admit Swiss Chalet is one of those places where when u have a craving for rotisserie chicken you can be sure to get your cravings met,well at least for me... I probably order from this place every other month and they are pretty consistent with their food. I would give them a four star if it hadnt been for the fact that the fries are not always fresh tasting, good, but sometimes taste like its been reheated 30% of the time. Not that bad considering. I love the double leg dinner. Thats usually  my order. Make sure when you place your delivery order make sure you mention 40 minuts or its free. One time the customer rep did not mention that and they said it was not free because the sales rep didn't say it was. Also write down the time its supposed to come."}
{"text":"This evening I went to the take out counter at 8pm.  I ordered a 1/4 chicken with fries and a extra bun. The cook in the kitchen had a flossing pick in his mouth. Taking it out of his mouth playing with it putting it back in and making our food. I asked the girl at the counter to eat the bun he had put in a bag after playing with his flossing pick. She wouldn't eat it? Let me tell you I don't want it either. She didn't offer to exchange my bun nor my order. I'm so disgusted right now.  I made sure the other guest heard what I thought of this. No supervisors overlooking what's going on?!? All I have to say is yuck!!"}
{"text":"Recently renovated and much better. They didn't have their liquor licence so we would have had a glass of wine since we lived close. Standard Swiss Chalet.   In general the chain isn't what it used to be. Their ribs are terrible now, and nobody wants roast beef. Really they just don't."}
{"text":"The service was horrible. I ordered using the Ritual app. I waited at the Ritual pickup sign and was ignored until I said excuse me. I was given my order but it seemed like an inconvenience to them. On my way back to work I noticed that the order was wrong. I went back. The man was angry. Won't be going there again. It is true that the sauce does not taste the same."}
{"text":"Nice chicken and rib dinner with the family tonight. Saved $4.57 on a $90 tab thanks to a 15% off Yelp checkin offer.   Wife and I had the rib special which was a free quarter chicken with a half rack of baby back ribs. Reatha had the crispy ribs. All three of us had dessert, too.   Service was excellent. Staff were very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Food: 2/5 ordered the chicken wrap with a side Ceasar salad, the salad was drenched in Cesar sauce, and I only got the \"ends\" of the salad. Also got the spinach dip as an appetizer and there was literally 15 small size pieces of nachos. The dip was delicious though.   Overall: customer service here was horrible, the waitress was full of attitude and felt like she was \"throwing\" down our plates instead of placing them. Will not come back to this location"}
{"text":"Typical Swiss Chalet location.  Fast service, easy to get in and out during a lunch hour.  Biggest difference?  We swear that the majority of servers have been here their entire careers, since the time of 'waitresses' and the freaky Swiss-styled costumes.  They know the menu, operate efficiently and are no-nonsense."}
{"text":"If your wanting chicken for lunch like I was I would suggest sitting In for your meal.  If you decide I'm going to go to pick up my order don't!  Is like walking down a back lane to get your food from a sketchy trash can...  also don't do the drive throw because if your like me and used the take out door you might end up hitting someones car with the door like I almost did."}
{"text":"This place is suppose to be a master at chicken products. But I was very disappointed when I was served frozen (yes, hot on the outside. Still frozen inside) chicken fingers. This is not acceptable for an establishment that has been here for that many years.   They have completely lost my business."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with the family on Easter Sunday, staffs are rude and very unaccomodating, you know the feeling when they are only there for the pay and not to serve the customers. We're never coming back to this store, EVER."}
{"text":"Not a full service Swiss Chalet. It's a Swiss Chalet/Harvey's. You order both at the counter. If you sit on the small Swiss Chalet side they'll run your food out to you."}
{"text":"Consistent quality with other Swiss Chalet's, absolutely delicious! I've only picked up food from this location, but that's mostly due to my dislike of the atmosphere these chains have. It's not cozy, and the staff are often hasty with you. The lady I ordered takeout with was nice enough, but I often feel that Swiss Chalet is very lacking in their easy and fair customization options. For example, it's difficult to upgrade from a quarter chicken meal to a half chicken meal for a coupon. It should have been a 4 dollar difference, but I ended up needing to buy another meal (just the chicken itself was a dollar less than the meal, bad deal).  I don't blame the staff, but I definitely don't get that feeling that Swiss Chalet particularly cares for their customers. At least the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"For a large food chain I have always been impressed with how fresh Swiss Chalet's meals taste.  If you have a coupon you can order ahead, just don't mention the coupon like I did or they won't take your order for some reason (only applicable if using a coupon without a takeout code). They've perfected their system so much that when I called in I'm pretty sure I reached a call center, which I found strange.   They're so rushed they got my order wrong, I ordered two plates that included 1 mashed potato, 1 fry, and a whole grain and white bread roll. I ended up with both a mashed potato and whole grain roll. They were still really good, but definitely a place where you should double check your order for takeout.  The atmosphere never sat well with me, but I was never really here for the atmosphere. The chicken is fall off your fork good."}
{"text":"Tried this Swiss Chalet location for the first time last night, they had an awesome deal I just couldn't say no to, a coupon for: Deluxe Dinner for 2 for $20! A steal of a deal.   One thing I thought was awesome is their franchise website, you can set-up delivery or pick-up with ease online and even enter coupon codes in their checkout system. I even got to choose my desired pick-up time, great system for maximum convenience! You don't even have to enter payment information, you just pay when you pick-up.  I'm also on a strict diet right now and I was surprised to learn that they had some pretty reasonable options, especially the chicken. Basically all protein and pretty minimal fat and carbs, usually eating out is a huge hassle to fit items into my macros but here it wasn't too hard. Again their website really made this part easy, super simple to pick items and calculate the total nutrition! Impressed with this for sure!   So we picked out the items we wanted online, very simple and easy. You can even select if you want utensils and condiments online! This meal included x2 quarter chickens dinners (includes side and a roll), x1 appetizer and a slice of pie. Unfortunately I couldn't do the pie because of my current diet :'(.   When we went to pick-up I was surprised to learn they have a dedicated pick-up entrance adjacent to the kitchen, great idea and logistically efficient! Overall super impressed with how seamless the ordering online to picking up works out. The food was ready on time as requested online and she included the utensils and condiments I requested online. Upon un-boxing everything at home I noticed some things were wrong though, I don't know why I put so much trust in this part of the takeout process as things usually always go wrong. I had a whole wheat bun instead of the garlic bread I ordered and they also forgot one of the Garden salads (not sure if it was the side salad or the appetizer salad as we ordered the same kind)... My bad for not checking before leaving, but I'm still big on the restaurant doing their part here and I'm docking them -1 for order accuracy. I didn't make a fuss over it given the deal and good process otherwise. For a sec I also thought they forgot croutons as the nutritional guide referenced these, however there was a discrepancy between this guide and the actual menu so I'm not holding them accountable for that part. The food we did get though was good and met the usual Swiss Chalet wholesome type dinner you'd expect, I definitely enjoyed it all and it was fresh/warm! I even tried a small bite of the pie which was good as well. Swiss Chalet is not a classy 5-star dinner but if that's what you want then you shouldn't be ordering here, it's a step above fast food, affordable, wholesome and family oriented.  If it wasn't for the missed salad and garlic bread I'd give them 5/5 as everything else met my expectations and the take-out process greatly exceeded what I'm used to. I'll definitely give them another go though!"}
{"text":"I went to this Swiss Chalet for their signature rotisserie chicken. I like the flavour of their sauce and the tenderness of the chicken. It's a shame that the fries were moderately burnt, which made it taste less than optimal.  The service was fast and friendly on a weekday lunch hour. I was barely settling into my seat and the food arrived already - it was even faster than some of my experiences at fast food places like McDonald's!  All in all it was a decent experience, just could have been better if the fries were not burnt."}
{"text":"5 stars for the service I got the other day.  I often go to this location b/c I work nearby on occasion.  After I had finished eating, I realized I FORGOT MY WALLET!  My boyfriend was at home where my wallet was and I asked if he could pay over the phone with my credit card.  The manager recognized me from coming in all the time and said not to worry about it and I could just pay the bill the next time I come in!  I couldn't believe it."}
{"text":"This place is a shadow of its glory.  On the weekend, only two sections are open, maybe 3 but that's pushing it.  They are always short staffed.  Came here tonight and waited 20 minutes to get our order taken. Could have at least acknowledged us while we were waiting and trying to make eye contact while she bustled by us.   We were miffed at waiting so long (15 minutes into waiting, she said she'd be right with us, while she tended to the other three tables being friendly to them).  We were just about to leave when she finally came.  Food took a while, but when it did, we had to wait for everyone else to get theirs.  And gravy was nearly forgotten, so we had to go and ask to remind.  At no point were we checked up on, nor did she even ask how the food was.  Food was very salty and mgr was indifferent when we informed her.    Give this place a hard pass.  It's a matter of time before it closes up.  You can't justify keeping a restaurant this size open if it's considered \"busy\" when a third of the restaurant is open"}
{"text":"Service : 3.5 / 5 Environment : 3.5 / 5 Food & Drinks : 3 / 5 Price : 3 / 5  Overall : 12.5 / 20  Comments - overall experience was decent in all categories (food, service, environment) \ - can'y really go wrong with Swiss with their chicken, and this location is up to par with typical big box restaurant chain."}
{"text":"I love going to Swiss Chalet during the Festive Special, I do not know why but I am addicted to the stuffing!  I go to the Chalet of the Swiss how often I can while the festive special is being served, and then I have to wait another year for the stuffing to come back!  This location is convenient for me, it is tucked away so not very many people probably know of its existence. I do know that they do a good lunch business from the office workers which the Swiss Chalet is located under.   The waitress's here are all very friendly, I have never had a problem.   However on one of my trips to this location I saw the kitchen staff moving the garbage dumpster outside the building and that kind of turned me off so I drove away, luckily I saw that before I went in and ordered food. I sure there is someone else who could move the dumpster... You can only hope they washed their hands after wards!!!  Eek!!"}
{"text":"When it comes to Swiss Chalet some locations are better then others. What makes this location a better one a server named Denny. He will always get your order right and he is so friendly. He keeps on top of the pop refills and always has a nice big smile on his face! If you go to this location ask for Denny is he is working."}
{"text":"Great new location here, everything is just so new and fresh! Swiss Chalet isn't exactly gourmet dining, and the food is at times on par with McDonald's usually...But its still a nice little place to check out here and there to grab a bite to eat, especially when hungry. The chicken alone is really quite good, and coupled with the special dipping sauce that they have, it makes a killer combination, it really does. The servers here are not the greatest, the food mediocre, and for this particular location there is so much seating, and its so open that it almost has a negative effect on the location...It makes it seem as though there isn't many people in the restaurant, and that its not very popular because of all the empty seats, at least that's the way I see it. The servers here are slow, and took forever to even give us the bill last time I was here, like they took so long I was about ready to just leave without paying...It was ridiculous, yet I still tipped...But I really won't be coming back here anytime soon, if there's another option available I'll jump on that before ever checking this place out again."}
{"text":"Love this Swiss chalet - besides the always great chicken, fried and awesome sauce - this one comes with an outdoor patio - which is great for sunny summer days. They have done a great job of sheltering from the traffic - my only recommendation is to add flowers and stuff to make it look and feel more like a patio.- and they should promote it :) It is a great local place.  Ok - worst service today - out on the patio at. 430 and the restaurant is vacant - yet I have yet to have my lazy-ass server come and check on me - after 35 minutes -  zero service equals zero tip and zero incentive to come back - what a shame - I used to love it here - hoping management sees this posting"}
{"text":"This location always has great service and many of the servers have been there for years.  It's more \"neighborhoody\" then others.  Can never go wrong with their lemon merange pie :)"}
{"text":"Swiss Chalet! One of my favourite \"homey\" restaurants and this one did not disappoint! My sister and I came here for the 2 quarter-chicken dinners for $15. Our waitress was fantastic and extremely sweet. The food came fast and it was delicious and fresh! The chicken was juicy and hot, my salad was yummy and my sister's fries were crispy and hot. And that gravy....mmmm that gravy, I could drink it ^_^"}
{"text":"Been here many times, and love the service. Child friendly is nice and any concerns we had with our food, the manager came and spoke with us sincerely. A bit pricey, but their service makes it great."}
{"text":"Two weeks ago, we decided to grab swiss chalet for dinner because We missed their chicken and fries. After we were sit, we waited for twenty mins, and no one came to us. We just left the restaurant.   This time, we think it might be better if we do delivery, so that we can get the food we want without getting ignored in the restaurant. To be honest, the food quantity has gone down. They didn't even get the order right. They got one of the side and the drink wrong. Also, missing one set of utensils. Don't know what they are doing.   The sauce looks less than usual. We won't go there, or even order online from them again. I still like swiss chalet. I have tried the one in DT location. It is much better than this location."}
{"text":"Where to start? Well my Fiancée, a friend an I arrived here on a quiet day at around 430pm. We were greeted by the manager of the establishment fairly promptly and he even took our drink orders, he told us that our waitress will be with us shortly. About 3 minutes later she approached our table and asked what we would like to drink, when we told her that the manager took care of the drink she seemed very shocked. We received our drinks fairly quickly but we were then left alone and ignored for about 25 minutes before we could even order. She took our orders down  and said she will be back shortly with our food. Well I guess everyone has a different version of shortly. 45 minutes go by and still no food in sight, we asked the waitress what is going on, very flustered she tells us it is coming out now. We asked her to have it to go in this case as we now do not have time to sit down and enjoy our meal. I also asked her if she can provide us with pop to go seeing as how we paid for them and since they it so we can not eat there, this at least was done by them. Now as for the order itself, we got 1 double leg dinner with baked potato, 1 half chicken with baked potato and 1 half chicken with fries and extra challet sauce. What we got was 3 double leg dinners 2 with baked potato and 1 with fries, and no extra challet sauce. Thank God I know that not all Swiss Challet are like this because if they were I would never go to one ever again. I can not even give a star for food quality because let's face it it doesn't matter which SC you go to it will taste the same. As for the service here I wish I could go to 0 stars! AVOID THIS LOCATION!!!"}
{"text":"Hmm not a fan of this swiss place. I had the chicken from swiss chalet usually I have better chicken. This time not really . salad was not fresh and seemed old so I am not a fan of it. Servers omg where do I start they have old servers like come-on hire something younger. Servers were not bad but I would expect something better for the eyes. Over all I hated the place Cuz it did not meet my expectation of swiss chalet and I am not a big fan of swiss chalet in general as nothing is special about them. Their special dip is ok."}
{"text":"Decent place, I came here the other day with friends to grab some chicken. I end up getting the shrimps which I liked. They were tasty I got them as an add on to my friend order of chicken for 5 bucks. i am not a big fan of swiss chalet chicken as I had many better Rotisserie chicken better than this. the place was empty and the theme of swiss chalet is always dressing and I donot like. But I came with friends so i end up having to come here."}
{"text":"Complete GARBAGE. I've had frozen chicken dinners that tasted better than this slop. The food (and service) here just isn't all that terrific.  I honestly fail to see what the attraction is with this place and don't know how they stay in business.  All part of the CARA Foods empire, the same nitwits that also own Harvey's, East Side Mario's, & Kelsey's.  I wish we had a Popeyes close by... Avoid this food unless you want to spend the night visiting the porcelain god.  Absolute pig swill."}
{"text":"My review may be completely biased because I love the food here so much that I once worked here part time while working a full time job. I simply cannot get enough of their sauce (which btw, the one you make at home? not the same -_-) and as such, if I am out of ideas for dining option ,this is the place for me. I particularly enjoy going to Swiss Chalet with my ONE friend who finds their sauce unpalatable (WTF?!) because it leaves more sauce for me. If you've done something that requires me to forgive you, having an abundance of their sauce and chicken + buns in your hands, will increase the chances dramatically.   I AM UBER HAPPY FOR THIS RESTAURANT opening at Dufferin Mall. There was Boston Pizza, which I tried and wasn't too thrilled- and because the ONE restaurant in that mall wasn't satisfactory, it also reduced my shopping trip hours also because food court food only takes you so far. I think my eyes just about popped out when I saw it was a Swiss Chalet - at last, one opened near enough to me that I can walk over to. I was sad to see a few of my staple locations close down - so this one opening was a great relief that it will continue to be in business, and I will be in close vicinity. There is one thing I LOVE about this location - the service is quite good - which is not something I say often - but they are as it should be, as it were in the old days. They are friendly, prompt, accommodating and well-humored. I mean, so often servers at restaurants are friendly but they aren't really interested in having a conversation with you; well, they do here.  I have been to this restaurant about 5 times? which is not many times - but the hostess remembered me and initiated small chat; so did the waitress(apparently she served us a couple of times) and remembered that I like extra sauce and even included an extra bun for me, ending up in BIG BROWNIE points in my books. I mean, I regular various restaurants and food joints a like, but only two places remember who I am or what I like - this being the only franchise location. Granted,I don't expect them to, of course, but it's uber flattering that my patronage is appreciated. I hope they stay there forever. If it was a doll I would hug it, squeeze it and call it George."}
{"text":"Just doing some take out tonight. Hickory chicken flat bread and chicken wrap. Always fast take out and fresh."}
{"text":"Nothing like a bowl of swiss chalet chicken noodle soup to make you feel better when you're sick.   Service was fair & meal was standard decent food."}
{"text":"I get delivery from this place once a month because my wife likes it and it's the only Swiss chalet in Georgetown, but in the last 11 months of living here they have NEVER got the delivery right. NEVER! I'm starting to think they all sit there and laugh on how they are going to mess with me this time."}
{"text":"We had great service with a wonderful waitress tonight named Anita, she was checking up on us regularity asking for refills and if there was anything we needed. The place was pretty busy and she was tending to everyone very well. My food tasted amazing, I got the chicken pesto penne which I get everytime and this time it was probably the best, chicken was done great and everything was perfect temperature when it arrived. The renovations look great too!!"}
{"text":"Wasn't too hungry because I had a large breakfast, but the service was there. I just had a bowl of soup. Which at 4 bucks is a pretty good deal for a bowl of soup at a restaurant. Get free water and a nice bowl of soup for 4 bucks isn't bad. My friends got the pot pie and the quarter chicken deals. Overall, the food is standard chalet food.the service was good. No problems. If you are still hungry, then drop over to Harveys and get a burger.  The only thing I wish is that you could order a burger from Harveys while eating at swiss chalet so you have options. Who wouldn't want a chalet chicken with a Harveys burger?  Well, maybe they will change this eventually."}
{"text":"Swiss Chalet is overpriced.  I'm on sale for 150 billion if anybody is in the market for their own Blake and believe me when I say I'm under-priced.  Their food is average.  The gravy is sweet and shouldn't be and their chicken is alright.  I always try to get there early in the day as the chicken is still pretty fresh and juicy.  Overall, it's okay but good if you're desperate for a filling meal, but there isn't really anything extraordinary to be found there."}
{"text":"I've always been a St.Hubert type of person, but since they packed up and left the GTA a few years back and I don't feel like driving 4 hours to the next closest one, I sometimes drop by Swiss Chalet.  Now, despite the fact that they are such a distant second, Swiss Chalet is usually not that bad. Their chicken is juicy and the fries do have a certain cache or appeal to them. The sauce is also oddly appealing.  This location however, is lacking. For starters, the service ranges from very slow to completely indifferent. I used to work in the building this is located in and they typically got 50-60% of the orders our lunch group did for take out, wrong. And these weren't large orders where it would be easy to forget something, it was typically 1-3 people ordering. The service in house is equally as bad (one time hostess basically told us she was too busy and to seat ourselves, she wasn't able to. It should be noted the restaurant was empty at this point. We walked out), it is slow as it gets (lunch hour was always a challenge to get back to work within the hour), and sometimes the chicken was kind of dry. Not always lousy though, I have been there and had good dining experiences, but they are too far and between each other to warrant going back.  Not worth the trip!"}
{"text":"One of these days I'm expecting to read in the news that all Swiss Chalet restaurants have closed up. They're an odd restaurant. A lot of people love them, but they're the type of chain restaurant that seems to have a client base just based on them being there. If they up and disappeared one day, no one would notice or care.  Don't get me wrong, I like Swiss Chalet. It's good. It's pretty tasty, the fries despite always being kind of soggy are enjoyable for some reason and the chalet sauce is actually pretty tasty. This location in particular is not bad. I've been a couple times and service is always fairly punctual and the food hot and arrives quickly.   The atmosphere isn't really there, and frankly, I wouldn't expect it to be from a Swiss Chalet, although this location in particular is fairly cavernous. Maybe make it a bit more like Baton Rouge, although they themselves are also fairly cavernous at times.  Pretty much what you'd expect from a Swiss Chalet. Not bad, not great. I go because every now and again, I get a craving for rotisserie chicken."}
{"text":"Admittedly the quality of the product has dipped over the last 10-20 years but i still order relatively regularly as it's quick easy chicken.  I ordered on Saturday night and received an email advising my order had been placed. I waited for 2 hours and my food never came. I sent a message that night and received an unapologetic response the next day advising that their call centre had closed and that they attempted to call my phone number.  I had advised that all previous correspondence that was with Swiss Chalet had been received via email, including order receipts and order tracking, yet no correspondence was sent advising that my food would not be coming.  By midnight i was stuck with whatever i had in my fridge and ended up microwaving swiss cheese and bacon (!!!)  No resolution has been offered at any point and no further orders will be placed by myself."}

{"text":"The place is terrible! Every time I go there they make a mistake! They can't keep my order straight even when I order online and give them my telephone number today they tried to charge me $104 for a $38 order! The other times I go for take out they don't know how to use the cineplex card to pay for the order or they have a deal with CAA for 2 can dine for $15.99 and they don't understand it. It takes me 30 mins or more to get an order that was ordered online and not because it isn't ready because my food was cold when I brought it home and I live 5 mins away by car. It is absolutely ridiculous. I can understand the odd mistake but not every time I come there! Today was the last straw never coming back!"}
{"text":"I often eat at Swiss Chalet, and I have to say, it's always been what I expected, the service is usually fast, the food is served fast, the food quality is consistent, and drinks are always replenished, so I am always satisfied and happy! My recent experience at this location was great, the Asian server we had was full of energy and was making jokes and was on her game! I accidentally asked for a kids menu as I used to come here a few years ago, and she cracked a joke and said no, I just then realized my sons are now 14, and 15, no more kids menus. It's always a great and simple experience and the quarter chicken w/fries hits the right spot for me everytime!"}
{"text":"I come here often when I'm alone and craving grilled chicken,,it's usually quiet on weeknights, the chicken is always made to perfection,,well according to my taste buds, and the fries and chalet sauce just complete the dish, love the food, love the sauce, and service is good most of the time, can be a bit slow depending on servers but the servers are always good, love my Swiss chalet experiences!"}
{"text":"The old reliable. Double leg dinner with coleslaw for myself. Same dinner with salad for the gf. No surprises here. Service is quick and efficient.  For FIRST TIMERS, Don't drink the lemon water, its not a sauce. Its for your hands, not the salad. Lol lol"}
{"text":"Three words for this branch  Disgusting, Disgusting, Disgusting. I cant believe that Cara foods have not taken away your franchise and closed you down for tarnishing the name of Swiss Chalet.  I moved into the area about two years ago and having since in the past been spoiled by possibly one of the best locations ever Dufferin and Apex shoutout goes to you I move downtown and tortured by this one location.  Both the wife and I love Swiss Chalet, its not really a guilty pleasure except for the fries and is better than Pizza if you are not in the mood to cook.  I have way too many stories to tell regarding this location but except if you love receiving french fries that have been scooped off the floor or other peoples plates that they have left behind this place is for you.  I have ordered countless times in hope my complaints would get me better food however complete hits and misses. I have been given free meals, replacements dinners etc etc because at first I would give the benefit of the doubt than like everyone else could not believe i was charged $40 for absolute muck in a box and complained all the time. Sometimes the fries were soggy, old or the best not even there like the driver ate them on the way over.  Stay clear of this location, do not order delivery but honestly i think its the location as the mall its in is very sketchy and they probably let randoms be the chef for the day.  I had even resorted to desperation by begging the Swiss Chalet operator to let  me receive deliveries from another location and was told no.  Be warned do not order."}
{"text":"Regular food. No big deal but cleanliness is an issue. I don't understand why they wipe down tables with wet cloths and leave it wet for you. DRY THE GID DAMN TABLE PEOPLE!!!!  OMG!!!! Loud birthday from the staff. Strike 3. I'm out of here. Not going back."}
{"text":"I'm giving 3 stars only because the customer service was excellent. I don't know if the quality of the food has gone downhill or if my family and I have just spoiled yourself with home bbq'd beer can chicken, but really the only good thing I can say about our experience here was that our server (Ashley) was very friendly and attentive to our dietary restrictions. She deserves a raise and a customer service award!"}
{"text":"Love how some of the reviews are about Denny. He truly is an exceptional staff member and this location is so lucky to have him! I've heard so much praise about him from my friends and he certainly did not disappoint. He was always on top of orders ensuring we have enough of everything, telling you all the deals and specials, and overall very friendly. If you go to this location enough and order the same food, he'll probably know what to get you right away without asking haha.   The food is decent. If you ask me the food is just your typical Swiss chalet food if you get their regular chicken and legendary chalet sauce.   Lots of space in this restaurant considering we went on a Friday night. Surprisingly, it wasn't so busy and I felt like our group was pretty loud. Service was excellent and I def would not mind coming back to this location again.   FYI, if you pay with gift card, don't forget to tip as you can't pay tip with the card. Don't forget your scene points card if you have one too. Denny will remind you :)"}
{"text":"Cool, first to review Swiss Chalet.   Another regular every time I visit Canada. The food is good and it is nice that they have a full bar which was a surprise. Good options for take out as well. They have a solarium area which is convenient.   Surprised to see all the awards that they have won and are displayed near the entrance. A solid 3!"}
{"text":"It different here.You order here at counter you let them know if it for here or to go.Food is good. The employers are freindly.You find anything like that"}
{"text":"One of the worst Swiss Chalet out there. This location keeps going down hill on my every visit. No one cares about the quality of the food or guest. Tables are always sticky, dirty, dark burnt oil tasting fries and Dark meat soo dry like its been sitting in some warmer for hours, cant even chew it. I'm surprised this location is still open. Don't waste your hard earned money here."}
{"text":"Popped into Swiss chalet. When I'm feeling off, I was bred to eat at Swiss chalet.   To make a long story short, it took forever to place my order. Took even longer to actually get my food. When I asked for the bill, it took the longest.   Food was good - standard Swiss chalet food.   But the service was slacking big time."}
{"text":"I didn't like this place at all. I blame my friend for taking us there. The drinks option were limited. The food weren't that good. Customer service was okay. They need to hire younger and more energetic employees.  We ended up packing all of the food and gave it to a homeless person who was sleeping ..the first homeless man refused lol!"}
{"text":"This location is the closest one to my home so I went there tonight to use up the last of my gift card(s). I ordered the Double-Leg dinner with fries, to go.  Once again, I was truly disappointed with the tiny size of the chicken - a leg and thigh is barely larger than the cup of sauce. I kind of expected that because of my last visit. This time, however, the chicken was salty, overcooked, and very dry. This should not have been served.  Thankfully, I now have a zero balance on my gift card and no obligation to return!"}
{"text":"lol no one here is to take out my order ; was at pick up. Seems like understaffed and don't care! Lol"}
{"text":"Food is typical Swiss Chalet but this location is dirty.  A trusted friend worked there briefly & was disgusted with the attitude behind the scenes.  Dirty.  He told us to go to the employee entrance & you could see the grease build up around the door. Food dropped on the floor was put back on the plate & served.   Our family used to enjoy Swiss Chalet but, after we heard that, we've never had it again."}
{"text":"There were three tables in total aside from ours on the afternoon that I came in, and one had already been served their food, so it was not busy in the slightest. Server took our orders hastily. We waited around 10 min for one starter, and another 20 ish, maybe longer, for our mains. The table next to us, however, which had the same amount of people, got served at around the same time as us and they came in at least 30 min after. My mom ordered ribs so that might've been part of the reason, but everyone else had pretty regular menu items so I can't imagine why they were so fast with one table and so slow for ours. I ordered a veggie burger and it arrived almost cold, fries were crispy but also not really warm. Upsetting."}
{"text":"Swiss Chalet used to be a popular dining spot where you received good value and good food.    On this occasion I placed a delivery order.   Everything seemed under-sized, even the chicken.  Garlic toast side order is basically appears and tastes like a half-wedge of 10 day old pizza crust.  Caesar salad side, wilted and uneventful.  I feel as though my intelligence was insulted when they can charge $45 ($3.50 delivery & tax included) for two double quarter chicken (Legs & thighs, assembled) with a bit of processed potatoes and a bun packaged in an abundance of assorted plastics weighing about the same or more as the contents.  You can see how driving profits at the expense of a great dining experience has won over here.  I won't be ordering from Swiss Chalet again.   Maybe they are just so busy they have to raise prices and reduce quality to meet the demand.  I think there are plenty of better choices out there."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the nicest Swiss Chalet restaurants I have been to. Our server, Honey, she was great. Very attentive and catered us quickly. Our meal came out hot and delicious. I ordered the Chicken Pot Pie with House Salad as the side. It was perfect and dreamy. Excellent job overall."}
{"text":"Food was alright, didn't get what I ordered but I was hungry.  Our server was nice, but you could see a lot of the servers around just moaning and complaining it was really uncomfortable."}
{"text":"We dined at this Swiss Chalet on New Year Eve.  I was surprised that it was opened, even more so for how busy it was.  I ordered a rib and wings combo.  The ribs were tender and meaty.  The spicy wings put many pubs to shame.  What really pushed the rating to 4 stars was the enthusiastic, effective, efficient and friendly services.  A waitress wore a warm smile working the evening shift at Swiss Chalet on NYE?  THAT is a 4-star attitude."}
{"text":"This is my neighbourhood Swiss Chalet.  It is quite busy during lunch hour on weekdays and all day on weekends.  Myabe it is just me, but I think the chicken is just a little bit more salty (in a good way) than the chicken at other Swiss Chalet locations.  I always find the chicken of other locations too bland, so this change in taste is good.  The services is usually friendly.  The interior is standard like other locations.  The place is clean usually.  On the evening I visited last Saturday, I saw a guy who I believed was the owner or the manager making rounds every now and then to ensure things are okay.  What more can I ask for?"}
{"text":"Was feeling hungry for ribs, but didn't know any place close by. Go tin my truck, started driving just looking for a place that had ribs. Just about to drive past Denison when I spotted the Swiss Chalet sign. I've tried their chicken before I'd never had their ribs.  The rib sauce is a little sweet for my taste but the ribs... toothsome.  Ha, finally used that word somewhere!  The place was nice and food was good, but service was sloooowww."}
{"text":"It's a Swiss Chalet, so you know what to expect. We visited the SC at Rutherford/Weston Rd and it was packed (no parking in their tiny lot) so we decided to hit the one on Highway 7 (since we were headed that way anyways). We arrived and it was fairly quiet. We were seated immediately. Server was over fairly quickly and we ordered, all 4 of us opting for the quarter chicken dinner, white meat, with variations on sides.  Food was out in a reasonable time and was hot and cooked to perfection. Our waitress was very good. We were in and out in about 30 minutes."}
{"text":"Not bad, but didn't blow my skirt up...  The chicken was tender and juicy, but I could have skipped the extra charge for the honey garlic. If there had been dipping sauce to match, it would have been a different thing altogether.  Fries were good."}
{"text":"Ah, we struggled to think of a place to grab a quick dinner that wasn't along our usual path. Swiss Chalet..Bieber stated that if he could fly somewhere and eat it would be back to Canada for a 1/2 chicken dinner at Swiss Chalet. Save your ticket - the meal was so so...chicken was drying out around the drumstick, but regardless the Swiss Chalet sauce and fries are always good. The atmosphere is the always obvious - the more chronologically advanced  and grumpier than ever crowd - if one had low self esteem this would not be the place to be a server as most diners are rude. The strategy here is get in and get out quickly."}
{"text":"Let's just say there's a reason why there are such LOW ratings for this Swiss chalet location - and boy do they live up to it! Earned every subtraction of a star - if I can give zero I would.   I'm almost ashamed to say I've been here a few times. My last xperience before this one was bad, it took everything in me to not be short with the unprofessionally immature waitress that tabled us. But I figured I will let it pass since my family actually enjoys Swiss chalet and this is the closest location to us.   However, our most recent experience has made us realize driving to Any other location will be better than going back here. The service just got worse. It was the worst sit down experience I've had in any food establishment much less a respected chain like Swiss chalet. The waitress was a nightmare and the manager (I later realized) is just as bad. Our party had 4 kids and a few adults,  all of which ordered their individual meals. The kids ordered drinks with their meal but only two arrived.. no re fills.. and the other two never came, even after reminding the waitress. I suppose she forgot. The kids who ordered chicken never got the Swiss chalet gravy.. apparently according to the manager, it's this locations policy to not give chalet sauce to kids... unless this location puts alcohol in the sauce, I don't see why this location would be so particular. Every other Swiss chalet location if been to in years have given sauce.. like why is this even an issue? Oh, and the cherry to top it all off? This location doesn't give treats OR desserts with kids meals. Even if the kids menu promise these aspects of your meal, this location chose to disregard their company's policy and follow their own. No drink. No toy/treat. No dessert. That'll make the kids want to come back for sure.   The adult meals came next. They got sauces, haha, nice to be \"of age\" i suppose?? The chicken was burnt. Like black edges burnt. my friend didn't eat it and we just left it on the plate. After the waitress insisted the chicken was fine, we asked for the manager. Her immediate response was that the manager was busy and will come later. Fine. When we followed up with our request, she said she already spoke to him and that everything was fine. We won't need to address the manager since she spoke to him already. We were going no where with this service and had enough trying to reason with hot air balloons.   Never again. If you plan on going to Swiss chalet, please do yourself and your guests a favour and DO NOT COME HERE."}
{"text":"I wouldn't go any of their restaurants. Menu card is poor and chicken they serve you can get from metro store is similar. I would expect better quality. While I was sitting in the bar it took nearly 10 minutes for bartender to ask if I would like to order anything. I would assume most of appetizers is pre cooked and they basically just warm it up."}
{"text":"Horrible service!!! Do not order take out from this location. We ordered the family pack meal with wings as take out and when we got home we realized the order was missing the wings and bread. We called the restaurant immediately and they agreed to deliver what was missing but the food arrived 1.5 hrs later!"}
{"text":"My father loves Swiss Chalet so he requested we go for dinner this Friday. The food was good, they have lots of new menu items now and everything is reasonably priced. I had only ever gotten takeout before but will chose to dine in more often now."}
{"text":"I love rotisserie chicken and how it's prepared here at Swiss Chalet.  The price has gone up over the years, but quality has been pretty consistent throughout all the locations I have been too.  I like the chicken and shrimp here the best.  The sauce and seasoning they had for the occasional shrimp promos were amazing.  The ribs and chicken wings are ok, but overpriced for the quality.  I remember loving St. Hubert as a kid, same as Swiss Chalet but I liked their sauce much better.  Unfortunately they are no longer in Toronto area.  Since then Swiss Chalet grew and has become a very successful family restaurant.  Take-out and delivery is available also, website is easy to order and can use online coupons."}
{"text":"We ordered through Skip The Dishes and were hoping Swiss Chalet would be worth all the hype (at least, people say the chalet sauce is really something special). I ordered the 1/4 rotisserie chicken with a whole wheat roll, a side of mashed potatoes, and an additional side of corn. My husband got the chicken pot pie with a side of poutine, a whole wheat roll, and an additional side of chalet sauce since his meal didn't seem to include any. This is what we got for ~$42.00...!!!!   The chicken was alright. No real complaints- it's fast food chicken. The mashed potatoes are about the same as KFC, with similar tasting gravy. The corn was boring, pre-frozen. They gave me a white roll instead of whole wheat, but I ate it anyway. My biggest gripe was the chalet sauce. What's the deal with this stuff? It tasted like chai in way. Like a strage, nutmeg-y chai sauce. It was really odd and not good. Nothing tasted right when dipped in it. I don't understand.  What we recieved in the bag of food was the sauce that came with my meal, the sauce that secretly came with my husband's meal, the extra (small/4 oz) side of sauce my husband had ordered, and an additional BIG container of sauce that we did not order and hopefully did not pay for.  I cannot understand why I read so many reviews about this sauce tasting amazing, and descriptions of the flavor being different from what I tasted. I would rather drench my meal in donair sauce or proper poutine gravy.   Speaking of poutine, this was really disappointing. Fries were squishy, gravy was too thick, and the cheese was entirely melted and could hardly be tasted. Just...nope.  I cannot justify eating here again, so...I'll just keep wondering why people return. They are expensive and not very good. I'm really bummed that we spent $42 on this. I could have got the same thing at KFC for like... $15."}
{"text":"First, let me say, I LOVE SWISS CHALET in general.  I frequent many locations but...I have tried this Swiss Chalet at least 3 times and every single time, THEY FAIL.  The chicken wrap is gross, smells weird and has undercooked bacon in it.  The fries have been awful everytime.  Other Swiss Chalet locations are good but trust me, AVOID THIS ONE!!"}
{"text":"This store is proof location is everything. Bad service, long wait for food. Much better places to eat downtown."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all.  My chicken portion was as big as the scoop of stuffing i had on my plate (refer to photo).  Quality going down, in my opinion..This is all that I can say of this place."}
{"text":"I wouldn't normally write a review about Swiss Chalet because what can one really say, that hasn't been said before. I happen to like their chicken and they have been consistent for the past 20 years I have been eating there. And my ratio of eat-in to take-out is usually 20% eat-in, so the take out area is important for me.  At this location, they have a giant TV over the back of the POS terminal with no menu or useful information. The menu is posted on the side wall and is hard to read. The area is very small so what you end up with is a long wait time, while people try to decide what they want, and a packed small take-out area. I can imagine wait times at this location exceeding what the normal Swiss Chalet provides in terms of take-out service."}
{"text":"Came here a while ago and I totally forgot to write a review but here goes.   This is really big location maybe the biggest one Iv been to yet. It was me and a big group that came to eat here on a Sunday. There was not enough staff working on a Sunday that being said the service was slow, very slow. And the location is very big so you would think that they would have more staff working on weekends.   I think that we waited about an hour to say the least for waiting for our meals. We were all very hungry and craving that good yummy rotisserie chicken so bad. Ordered the half chicken with the side of a caesar salad. It was really good while I picked on my friends fries too. I picked the wrong day to eat healthy! The salad just wasn't cutting it on a very hungry stomach. The food was good though, no complaints there. Even though the service was lacking, the food was delicious. I probably wouldn't come back unless i really had to and I had a smaller group to come with."}
{"text":"Ok so I always like to give restaurants a lot of chances but this Swiss chalet is not the best the service is so bad that if you come in with a group( like I did) expect to wait a long time for you to order and get your food, the service is so bad that you will never see the server again other then when you place your order. When I was there we had got our food and my aunt had found that the chicken had blood in it which it was raw yes I said RAW we told the server and the server began to say oh that's how it is if it's coming from the bone NO! It's raw we know when something is raw the server took it back angry and didn't even want to listen to us so we asked for the manager I have to say that the only good thing is the manager is very nice and professional about everything but this is now my third time in here and there is always a problem with the food or the service my advise is retrain everyone and your food staff cuz they clearly can't handle the fast pace food industry"}
{"text":"This place ruins my childhood with this franchise...  The rotisserie chicken is pretty good and standard and tastes the same in every swiss chalet since I was a kid, but by good god is the service one of the worst I've seen in the food business.   On every occasion I've come here something terribly goes wrong for example: -Without a doubt you will be waiting at the door to be seated for at least 5 minutes even though the place is empty. The time for the server to come and take your order VARIES, sometimes it can be as fast as less than a minute or you might be kept waiting for 20, who the hell knows? The last time I came here was the absolute last straw, and will no longer give it second chances. I ordered the parm sandwich and my husband got a classic burger. When I ordered my parm sandwich, the waitress did not tell us it will take an extra long time to cook it and we ended up waiting for LITERALLY 30 MINUTES FOR OUR FOOD. After about 20 minutes I asked the waitress and she, in a condescending attitude, told me that the chicken parm takes a long time. During this eternal waiting, we got a total of 1 refiill and our cups were left empty for pretty much 25 of those 30 long minutes. By 30 minutes I was getting pretty pissed and I sternly told my waitress that it has been way too long and we will be leaving if it does not arrive. She quickly came back with the food and tossed it at us, at this point there was so much animosity between her and us. While my food was great, my husband's burger tasted like it has been out on the counter for 3 days. The patty was stale, tasteless, and burnt, the cheese has been sitting on the patty for so long that the edges have become hard, and pretty much it seemed like they took a burger that's been made and sitting there an entire day and microwaved it. We asked the waitress to take it back, paid for our food and left.  The attitude and deficiency of our waitress' personality and attitude was so entirely off putting that it made our entire (already awful) experience just that much worse. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Very poor service, waited over an hour for our food to arrive. Chicken was dry, the french fries were much greasier than shoud be accepted and the ribs were tough and flavourless. Servers did not care that we waited so long and would tell us to speak to the manager if we had an issue. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Worst Swiss Chalet location that I've been to.   The four of us were seated down by the hostess and were told that our waitress would be with us shortly. Waited 15 - 20 min and we still did not know who our server was, nor did we even have any drinks.  When we finally ordered, ate, and decided to pay, our server came back with the credit machine as we all had to use cards. Even if we had to do individual bills, I do not think she should have taken so long to come back for each person to pay. We waited for approximately half an hour just for everyone to pay because she kept leaving and coming back around 5 - 10 min later in between each person. The worst part is that she had the nerve to take the machine and hand it to another table just because they only had one bill. It would have been more efficient if she just finished up our payments and let us leave, instead of having us to wait for her.  Overall, the service is terrible and the food is only mediocre. I will not be going back to this location."}
{"text":"This is the location closest to my home, so it's the one I use.  If there were another close by, I'd switch.  The service is OK, and the food is usually acceptable, but the washrooms (downstairs) are usually out of soap.  I've complained three times, and each time they say they will correct the situation.  Is it too much to ask that the soap dispensers be filled every morning, and checked throughout the day?  A restaurant should take issues of hygiene seriously, especially one of this size."}
{"text":"3 of us went, on a Friday, around 5PM, chicken pot pie and 2 order's of 1/4 chicken.  Food was hot, timely to the table, but the service, horrible.  Had to repeat/correct our order with associate, had to change plates when they came to the table,  never checked with us during the meal (I was out of drink near the beginning of the meal).  It's rare that I get to Toronto, but in future, won't see me here.  4 stars for food, 2 stars for service, avg. = 3."}
{"text":"Been to a Swiss Chalet anywhere else? The food is highly consistent and mainly something you don't have to worry about at any location.  And that is the case here.  What is unique about this location is the staff.  They are extremely personable and make for a enjoyable stay.  If if like or love the food, make sure you make a concerted effort to stop by this location to enjoy the food and enjoy the lovely staff."}
{"text":"I don't expect much when I go to Swiss chalet. After all its a fairy simple straightforward menu. But I do have an issue when the food ordered is subpar for something that is dished out on the regular. Fries not fresh, drinks not taken or served within 10 minutes of sitting down, simple requests for sauces, kids desserts, big fails. Restaurant was not busy. We had a child with severe food allergies, but yet server could not answer questions or get the right answers. In fact, I think she was caught by surprise and lacked concern. At time of writing, they are promoting fried chicken. If u call fried chicken with a heavy batter that was overcooked. Not juicy, not crispy. It ain't fried chicken. Pls stick to your simple menu. It's a simple formula and it works, which is why I don't get how awful this restaurant chain is. As for this particular location, not coming back. And pls can somebody tell me when they stopped the finger dip in lemon water?"}
{"text":"I tried the rotisserie beef at Swiss Chalet tonight. They should stick to chicken. The beef was bland but they serve it with horseradish which gives it some taste. And while the beef was over cooked, the vegetables were under cooked. If you go to Swiss Chalet have the chicken. It's what they are good at."}
{"text":"Definitely come to the restaurant and don't order in. The portions and overall quality are better!   This is your average swiss chalet. The service is nice, thought the general atmosphere kind of feels like seniors home dinning.   We got the spinach dip as our free appetizer (which was like the stuff you get at the grocery store, good but definitely not too pretty), and two half chicken dinners. Our server was super friendly and comped us my club soda because of the wait time for the food and because she said they didn't charge for water.  Wait for the coupons, they're a great deal, and sign up online to get a free appetizer! I'll definitely be back with my coupons in tow."}
{"text":"Really good place for quick food.  Great service!  Ordered the chicken club wrap and pouting frys and the came out quick and were delicious."}
{"text":"Shortly after writing to the Swiss Chalet headquarters about this incident, I received a call apologizing for the inconvenience this had caused.  The individual on the other line also informed me that they would be sending the manager to extra training classes, which I am grateful for, because truly, he needs a lot of work.    I appreciate the fact that they've addressed this issue in such a prompt manner and mostly, for their apology and for that, I've improved my rating."}
{"text":"Absolutely hate this Swiss Chalet . Ordered from here numerous times && they always take OVER an hour &&a half to bring the food  , which by then is cold && you have to fight with them to send back out warm food but it almost doesn't make sense be it comes cold again ! Fries always taste stale && the manager is a douche . Ruined it for all Swiss Chalets"}
{"text":"Do not order delivery from this Swiss chalet...  Basically what happened was.  1. I order double leg meal.  2. Meal shows up 2 mins before the 50 min time.  3. Meal is cold as ice... All of it including the sauces  4. Call restaurant to ask for compensation for how cold it was. Because I Barely touched the food.  5. I am told by the manager that I cannot get my money back all he can do is send new food or give me 5$ coupon... For more food. The manager even had the nerve to say it was my fault the food was cold. And on top of everything I asked him if I order from you then I should be basically expecting my food cold? He responded with yes now do you want a new order... (I kid you not)  6. I try to refuse both the manager tells me it's either that or I get nothing. At this point super turned off from the food but don't want to be ripped off so I take the new meal.  7. Delivery guy shows and demands the old food back. I give him it outta the garbage.  8. Call the customer service reps for Swiss chalet.  9. Service rep calls him and gets the same attitude and rude behaviour as I did. She even tells me how shocked she is by how rude he was.  10. The service rep now is contacting the gm of the area to go over this managers head and she was very sweet and nice. Very apologetic and helpful through the whole experience.   I do not condemn Swiss chalet as whole because I eat there all the time but this Swiss chalet has no respect for its customers. Do not order from here unless you are more then ok with ice cold food. Whoever that manager is he most certainly should not be working there!!! If I could give zero stars I would!!!"}
{"text":"Food : 2/5 - Generic, low quality food. The chicken and pork ribs were dry.  Value: 2/5 - Pretty expensive actually, for the food they serve.   Can't really comment on ambience/service since it is a chain.  First time in S.C. Will never return. My \"friend\" strongly recommended this place. He has permanently lost my respect."}
{"text":"\"Swiss Chalet is all about real food made fresh by real people...it's slow roasted to perfection\" as per Swiss Chalet Website.   Well let me tell you...perfection for this Yonge location means toilet time!  WAIT STAFF So I brought my own bags for my takeout b/c I like using reusable bags.  I told the cashier this and said she could put all the food in my bags. She forgot and put my food in swiss chalet bags. Ok...so she forgot. No biggie.  We ordered the family pack with ribs. I was thinking..hmm... maybe I should check to make sure that everything was there.  Checked the bags and she forgot the ribs. It might have been able to understand if the place was super busy but it wasn't.   FOOD So we had take out. A friend bit into a fry and it was rock hard. But mind you, it was only ONE fry. So we continued eating.  Swiss Chalet didn't give any butter or ask me if I needed any utensils etc. so people were again a  tad disappointed.  About an hour later, one person had a stomach ache. They thought they ate too much. And then the next person had a stomach ache. And finally, my stomach started cramping and I spent the next hour in the bathroom.  And damn...I was in pain!  So I don't know what happened. The chicken didn't appear undercooked. Maybe the staff didn't clean their hands. But I don't want to think about why we all got sick.   SICK RATING : 3 1 (just a little sick) to  5 (Emergency, I think i have a parasite)"}
{"text":"We had a horrible server that didn't want to seat us where we wanted to sit because it had two extra chairs.   The pasta was tasteless and watery. We will not be back   The owner contacted me but didn't care to apologize."}
{"text":"I've been to Swiss Chalet a lot.  Ever since I was a toddler, I've been coming here with family.  My dad used to work here as well before I was born and it seemed like the best place for food.  Years have passed and it's almost like they don't care what they slop on the plate as well as not caring about how they slop it on the plate.  Today was super underwhelming because I wanted to see what their Thanksgiving package was again but it was pretty disappointing.  The staff were totally unaware that we walked in to the restaurant and we had to ask where staff were.  Confusing.  Hopefully they start putting more care into these chains because some locations are so much better than others.  There's no consistency."}
{"text":"I have been dining at Swiss Chalet for more than 50 years. It was always a family favourite restaurant. In recent years, the food quality and value has deteriorated. The last two times I dined at Swiss Chalet, the chicken was terrible. It was over cooked and very dry. Both times the restaurant was not very busy, so I assumed it had been standing for a long time under heat lamps after being removed from the rotisserie.  I had ordered the combination chicken and ribs meal. The ribs were okay. After finishing the ribs we asked the server for the finger bowls because our fingers were so sticky. She told us that Swiss. Chalet no longer provides finger bowls. We asked for wet wipes but wet wipes were not available. We were told we could wash our hands in the wash room. There are many other restaurants that serve much better barbecue chicken than Swiss Chalet, so I won't be patronizing Swiss Chalet any more."}
{"text":"I got dragged here by my white friend (because let's be honest, white folk are the only folk who enjoy Swiss Chalet's dry, bland ass food), and was - SHOCKER - disappointed. Food was blah as expected. My friend's mom sent her burger back because it was burnt. Service was DREADFUL. I had to ask three times before I got a water with no ice (at the end of my meal), and our server disappeared for lengthy periods of time.  Quelle surprise!"}
{"text":"Very tasty rotisserie chicken. I had 1/4 white and my wife had dark meat meals (with a side dish and a roll) for $15.99 with a coupon. Also offers BBQ, steaks and ribs."}
{"text":"This review is based only on their veggie burger meal. If you are vegetarian (vegan), your only possible non-egg and non-dairy menu option at Swiss Chalet is their veggie burger, but be sure to specifically mention your preferences or you might  find your veggie burger topped with cheese and mayo :)  The veggie burger itself is kind of dry but the portion is alright, usually comes with a side of fries but you can ask for salad. You may not be happy with the dry texture and bland taste but they do offer Tabasco sauce and I'm always thankful and appreciative to have AT LEAST one vegan option on the menu!"}
{"text":"This is our local Swiss Chalet and we've been here at least a dozen times. Great value. Friendly staff. Relaxed atmosphere. Delicious wholesome food. Reminds me of my childhood.  I'm surprised to read all the negative reviews. My only suggestion is to not order too far astray from what Swiss Chalet specializes in: chicken. I order the quarter chicken meal with white meat with either Caesar salad or fries on the side. I've been pleased every time.  It's also seems like an especially great place for a family on a budget to bring kids."}
{"text":"Me and my brother got the 2 can dine for 14.99 special and it was awesome. We took it for take out and it was very speedy. Awesome place to eat been loving this place for years."}
{"text":"I had lunch there a couple of days ago with my boyfriend. We both picked items from their festive menu. It was great!  We both enjoyed our meals. The food came out quick. The service was great as well. Completely forgot her name but she was the sweetest server and made sure our needs were tended. I would definitely return and recommend this location to anyone"}
{"text":"The great thing about Swiss Chalet is that they are very consistent.  This location appears to be fairly new and yet the food is just like the \"Swiss\" my ma Nd I used to go to... LOL  Here for lunch and it is busy, always a good sign."}
{"text":"I went to this location today and was absolutely appalled by the service. After being seated, the server did not ask for our drink orders, and decided to ignore us for 15 minutes before even placing an order. She left 3 extra menus on our table after ordering even though there were two of us. The chicken I ordered was dry and clearly old, And we didn't even receive the lemon water you normally get after a meal there. she disappeared for another half hour while we ate so we couldn't ask for additional service. All the other servers were obviously trying to avoid eye contact with tables that weren't their own. And to top it off, while paying for our bill the server had the nerve to take my gift card I was using to pay with and while punching in the cost, blatantly asked me what her tip amount was! Please save yourself and don't spend your well earned money here."}
{"text":"The service was great. Ask to sit in Robert D s section. Even caught a Pokemon while dinning"}
{"text":"If I do visit a restaurant franchise, the one in Calgary my family and I most frequent is Swiss chalet.  This one in particular is a favourite of mine; the sauce at this Chalet makes the chicken and the fries divine.  The other Chalets are sometimes hits and misses and this is the only reason I go to Chalet, for the sauce, so it better be up to par.  There is a nice combination of Chalet chicken and Barbeque Ribs that I order with a side of Cesar salad (my guilt) and fries.  We always start our meal with Crispy Dry Ribs and The Garlic Cheese Loaf, then share a pastry at the end of the meal, sometimes Pecan pie and other times Baked Apple Pie Crumble with ice cream.  Service is always excellent, the damage of the bill reasonable and of course the décor is the standard Swiss chalet paper cut design which I have no comment about."}
{"text":"So, I've been to a few Swiss Chalets by now, and mostly the service is pretty good.  I am not sure if it was just a bad night for the waitress, but her bad night became a not-so-awesome night for us.  So, it was a pretty busy Saturday night, but we were seated promptly. Waitress cruised by to take our drink order, and we ordered pierogies. Seems fine so far. Time passed, and she comes back by to deliver ... egg rolls.  \"I'm sorry, we ordered pierogies\" we said, and this is where things went downhill. Time passed. A lot of time passed. She silently brings the pierogies. She silently brings our entrees, and then pretty much ignores us for the rest of our meal. No checking up on us to see if our drinks needed refilling (I had water and I was really dying of thirst.) And then at the end, she left us with the credit card terminal, and never stopped by to pick it back up.  So yeah, not the best experience in the world."}
{"text":"Lee and I had the day off, but he wanted to meet and have lunch with some of his coworkers so they could meet me, and this was the place that everyone could agree upon. It's close to his place of work, and has a food range that satisfies everyone.  It's a bit older and dingy and stale looking inside. It feels like it is overdue for a facelift. Service was pretty OK: we got our food quickly, although they forgot my poutine and I had to ask to have it added. It wasn't really bad, but it didn't really stand out either."}
{"text":"I've been to a few Swiss Chalets since I have been making visits to Canada, and this is one of the nicer ones. It was really busy when we went in, pretty much packed to the gills, but there was no wait.   Service was pleasant, the food is pretty much the same you'll find at every other Swiss Chalet. This location is nice and clean, perhaps a little bit noisy.  Overall a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"This is a Swiss Chalet. There are many like it. But this one is mine.   Ok, maybe not mine. However, we did end up here for a lightning fast dinner just before a class in the same building.   If you have not been to a Swiss Chalet before, it is magnificently plain. It screams ordinary in a manner that only the chain can. Don't get me wrong. I like it. But you have to expect basic good chicken that is the same every time and that consistency mixed with a certain \"unlavishness\" is great.   I had the quarter chicken white dinner with fries. My wife had a chicken sandwich, dark, with fries. Both were as we have had before and satisfied our hunger in a very unexciting but delicious Swiss chalet way.   Come here for a good rotisserie chicken and ribs. You will get good service. You will not pay a lot and you will never be thrilled or disappointed. There is something to be said for steady goodness. And that for me is three honest stars!"}
{"text":"I like Swiss Chalet - check my other reviews.  There's a few of them out there.  My big problem is, this Swiss Chalet?  The service is pretty close to non-existent.  I don't ask for much.  I just want my water glass full, my sodas refilled, and my order taken quickly.  Maybe there are some people who like to sit down and talk for a while before ordering - but I am not one of them.  I want to get my food ordered, and on the way.  It's rare that I'm not hungry by the time I roll in.  Mind you, at the end of the meal, I don't want to feel as if I'm being rushed out.    At this location I've had to wait a while to order, and then when the food does come - it comes alone (without a refill of the drink that had been emptied in the interim.)  It's not like the waitresses don't get to your refill when they notice it - it's just that they're rarely around to notice.  I don't blame the wait staff (although there have been some occasions where they've walked right by.)  More often than not, I assume it's because they under staff.  I have no basis for this, it could simply be that the other locations I've been to over staff.  This seems to be the calling card of modern Swiss Chalets...  Still, I'd rather my dessert wasn't served with the bill.  At least make one more round before dropping that off.  P.S.  Parking was ample."}
{"text":"Key Feature: Rarely busy.  If you're out in the west end of Toronto, and feeling a large burger, fries, and coleslaw for the low-low price of 8.99, then why not stop by Swiss Chalet.  As always, Swiss Chalet offers you a tasty treat, and you know what you're getting into, before you're there.  Not to mention, a dipping sauce for less than 30 calories?  What a treat.  The only downside is, they often over-cook their burgers here, removing the delicious juicy texture you may be craving.  They're not hard brickettes, but they're not what they could be (and are at other locations.)  I hear the chicken is good here too."}
{"text":"Mirroring other reviews, the service wasn't the best.  But it was still a Swiss chalet.  That's becoming a bit of a problem though.  The quality of food is going down hill, and the white meat premium is going up in price.  It's not what it once was.  The fries, slathered in chalet sauce, though?  Still a winner all day long."}
{"text":"Key Features: Best cooked Swiss Chalet burger in the GTA  Yeah yeah - so there was that one time on Mother's Day when the waitress messed up our orders, gave us cold food, and was an all around, less than delightful server - but I tell you what - years of being fantastic will help me look past that.  There's one reason to come to this Swiss Chalet - and I'll tell you what it is, their burgers.  I don't know why the other Swiss Chalet's in the GTA can't cook them properly (and believe you me, I've searched around) but this place - they put a patty on a bun that is so juicy, you'd think it was cooked straight off of a George Foreman grill (if you believed the hype about how well a George Foreman grill can cook burgers.  Which I don't.)  The point is - don't think of this Swiss Chalet as a chicken join.  Think of it as a burger joint.  Now, I don't want you to go there, have the one time they're not cooked to perfection - because as I said above, I - too - had a bad experience once.  By 90% of the time, there's nothing more that I would want from my meal.  It's an all around treat.  And a great place to kick back with grandma, and talk about life, and all that comes between it."}
{"text":"Decent food.  Took 45 minutes for food to arrive.  Will go to Swiss Chalet again, but likely a different location."}
{"text":"What can you say about Swiss Chalet. It's consistent, delicious & fair prices. Had 1/4 White with fries."}
{"text":"This was my first eat-in at this restaurant (take out before) since it opened. I was with my crazy family as well which did not make things any better!   This is not a bad place. Swiss Chalet food is always consistent. I ordered the Festive Special which came with stuffing & cranberry sauce. It was tasty as usual & no complaints on the food. What I ordered & didn't get was \"crispy fries\". I order these all the time & they never deliver! Our waitress \"Stella\" was a bit surly but she may be able to chalk that up to my crazy family. I'd eat here again based on the consistancy of the food alone."}
{"text":"Dinner here. 1/4 Chicken (White) w fries. Ordered it on-line & went to pick it up. They had the order wrong. Missed an order of fries & Spring rolls. This was roughly 1/4 of the order!! How can a restaurant miss a quarter of an order & still call it correct?? Food is consistent but the Chickens are turning into Doves their sooo small now!! What's up Swiss?"}
{"text":"What can u say about Swiss Chalet. It's decent, it's clean, it's consistent. 1/4 Chicken white with Fries. Always good."}
{"text":"I've been to this SC a number of times over the years. The food is always good but never great. The service is always good but never great. Place was busy but not overly so. On thing i did notice is the size of the Chicken. They used to be a decent size so you could actually leave SC mostly full. Now the chicken are the size is a small Dove. I think we ALL know what happened there."}
{"text":"Swiss Chalet is one of my favourite restaurants. I know that for the most part I avoid chains, but for what you get for what you pay...it's not bad. 1st time I've eaten at the SC. Lunch for me today. It was surprisingly good. I had the Teriyaki veggie stir fry. It was hot, filling & decent for $13.99. What more can I add...nothing."}
{"text":"Once I got here, the server was running the whole restaurant. She finally came to us and sat us down in a smelly corner which other customers were complaining about. Once we got moved, there were three servers sitting on guest tables on their cell phone and inattentive, they were past their breaks but not helping the poor server who was actually working. For an hour, they were sitting there doing nothing. It was two of the eastern European servers that were sitting which made it look so pathetic. It's sad to see the owner has no regard for such an esteemed restaurant that is going down the drain. The staff needs to be replaced with a more motivated workforce rather than people who get paid to sit in a guest table and rip the owner's pockets for money."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a very unsatisfying experience today. We had gone to the new location on the south side of Lawrence thinking we would have a great meal and service as all Swiss Chalet locations are known for. The place was not busy, because it was late lunchtime. I thought ... wonderful, we can get our lunch quickly. The manager was preoccupied with a staff member, but realized and acknowledged we were present and awaiting to be seated. But from my observation, I had a sneaky suspicion that there was inadequate staff. There was no one tending to customers at the front entrance.  She had directed us to a location in the restaurant that had comfortable booths to sit in, but was obstructed by a wall with a tiny opening. She had promised that a server would tend to us as soon as possible. It was situated at the very back wall where it is difficult to see us and easy to forget. My wife and I had already decided what to order. I had the coupon for $12.99 double leg dinner, and my wife wanted to order a rotisserie Caesar chicken salad. I then noticed that people that were sitting in the more visible areas had their orders taken. I thought we were next. We waited and waited- watching others receive their orders.  There was a couple with a child that were seated next to us, and were shocked that we got up and left. I had decided to drive to the Scarborough Town Location. What even pissed me off even more is that I had forgotten the coupon for the promo I wanted at the Lawrence location, and was not granted the opportunity to enjoy the deal. It wasn't the waitresses fault- I can totally relate as I worked in food services before - but some consideration should have been given by management when I explained the scenario to the waitress. We were in fact at the Lawrence location @ 1:00pm and left @ 1:45pm without being served. We then arrived at the Scarborough Town location at 2:15pm and promptly served @ 2:30pm.  Bottom line is that my wife and I miss the ambiance of the previous location. I believe it was run very nicely by Greek management if I'm not mistaken. It had a very nice family friendly , accommodating feel, and the staff were more receptive and service was A+. I wholeheartedly agree with Reid E.'s assessment of this \"new design\". We were once loyal customers of the old location. If this is the direction Cara foods is taking, creating cookie cut designs of loud decor, and forgetting what brought Swiss Chalet to the top, I would rather have St Hubert's resurrected from the 80's and pay patronage there instead"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Swiss Chalet in a long time so I decided it was time for a visit!  They happened to have a quarter chicken honey garlic special which came with your choice of sides, coleslaw, garlic toast and a choice of soup or pie. I opted for the loaded baked potato chowder instead of the pie and it was a good decision. The soup was very hearty and it wasn't overly salty which I find to be the issue with many restaurants' soups. The actual chicken was glazed perfectly and it was very tender.  I have to say that Swiss Chalet is one of my favourite chain restaurant. I think it's better than Joey's which was nearby at Markville mall."}
{"text":"ZERO STAR SERVICE!  Horrible delivery service.  Late cold, rude dishonest driver.  Dinner should have been free due to lateness. I didn't know this, so he took the money and pocketed it.  When I called to complain the meal was cold the call centre told me it should have been free.  The driver shouldn't have taken my money in the first place.  He was trying to steal from me and the store.  When he brought me back my new meal I asked for the $4 tip I gave him back.  He laughed at me and left.  The store manage was suppose to call to deal with me.  1 week later still haven't heard from him.  Sent an email to Swiss HO which is Cara Operations..  Five days later I haven't heard from them.    Apparently Swiss doesn't concern itself with good customer service.  If I were you I'd think twice before buying Cara product, which is Swiss, Kelsey's, Montana's, Harvey's or Milestone.  Apparently if something goes wrong Cara won't back up their products or service."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place out No recommendations  Had their chicken quarter wth fries Nd gravy was ok not very good  For appetiser tried chicken spring roll was really sad with honey sauce  Absolutely tasteless  For the dessert had the coconut cream pie  Which was superb To die for and a must try The service was excellent!!! The servers very polite and gracious  Loved the decor ambience service  Food was not really good  May try something else the next trip"}
{"text":"Honestly, it was just sad. back ribs and wings combo and a side order of \"fresh cut fries\"  Fries: soggy, not salted, no flavor, seemed stale.  Now, all you really have to do is deep fry fries, not that hard, so at this point we should have been worried.  Wings: tiny, shriveled up, looks-like-they-bought-microwave-oven-wings-and-poured-muck-on-it wings, (of course, no flavour - not like BBQ sauce anyway  Ribs: Smelled rotten. Tasted rotten. A cup of muck to cover the taste on the side.  Never again.  (also what the hell is that website UX)"}
{"text":"Growing up around the area, this Swiss chalet has been our go to when we crave the Canadian staple. This place is always busy and hard to find parking. I find this store very inconsistent and sub par when compared with other locations. The servers often forgets condiments, utensils etc and is slightly rude at times. The white meat is guaranteed dryer than your cafeteria chicken. Side veggies always frozen and plated like prison food. Every time there leaves a lot to be desired, but people still go cause of the prime location."}
{"text":"Honestly, walked in and walked right out, after about waiting for 15 minutes, the waitress comes up takes our drink order, wait let me rephrase that, partially takes our drink order and while my girlfriend was telling her what she wanted, the waitress ups and goes and didn't come back so naturally we left the establishment. If she had to get something since she could of just said, excuse me I need to do something and we would of gladly waited. This isn't the first time this has happened. Asked for a manager and of course the manager isn't available. Called the customer service line and got no where either. We aren't looking for hand outs, just wanting to give feedback on how to fix these issues. If you go there don't expect great service."}
{"text":"It started with the Swiss Chalet ordering campaign, advocating the consumer to try something different that pizza.   So I did, and the first order went okay (Sept 17th). The food arrived semi-warm, and without utensils. It wasn't a complicated order, a veggie burger, salad, some fries and sauce.  The following week I was stuck at work last nights and didn't have time to cook. (Sept 24th) So I ordered again. Same thing, not a complicated order. Again, the food was not warm when it arrived. It took over 40 minutes to get here, and my fries were missing. Being a mild-mannered consumer I took it with stride, called the Swiss Chalet customer support hotline and advised them of my missing fries. I didn't mention anything about the cold food, didn't want to cause a commotion. I also didn't want to inconvenience the story by having them drive back out again for an order of fries. So they added a credit to my order.  The following night (Sept 25th), again, late night working, I knew I had the credit so I decided to order online. Same non complicated order. I realized afterward I couldn't use my credit online, so I forgot about it. It arrived, after 40 minutes, and again, undesirably cold. I put it in the microwave to heat it up.  The next day, against my better judgment, I was set and determined to use my credit. Ordered again. This time not only were my fries missing, my food cold, but the order was missing salad dressing. My mild-mannered Canadian attitude was gone. I called, told my story, and 30 minutes my fries arrived. Not surprisingly, cold.  (October 15) was the last night. Food was cold. Burger was burnt. Toppings looked like they were thrown on by an elephant. Salad dressing and condiments missing. I called the Swiss Chalet customer support line and the woman answering the phone began to raise her voice and give me attitude. She offered to connect me with the store manager. I asked, why do I need to speak to the store manager that is why I called you.   That was her only resolution, for me to speak with the store manager at 9:00 on a Saturday night. I am sure the manager has nothing better to do at that time, and would be more than accommodating about the situation. I know it sounds petty, but after all I've dealt with, I'm done. Over $130.00 spent on orders. I tried to be an accommodating customer, but I'm done.  Over 50% of the orders were missing items, 100% of the orders we cold, and not once did I get a genuine apology or remedy offer for their mistakes. Then received a message back from Swiss Chalet, telling me I was contacting the wrong department for complaints. Yeah, I don't think so. If you can't manage your internal customer relations, that is your own problem.  \"Thank you for contacting us regarding your order.  Because you indicated in your comments that this was an online/phone take-out or delivery order, you will need to contact our Delivery management team at 1-866-439-0439 (Toronto 416-439-0439) to have this matter properly investigated and resolved.  Their hours of operation are:  10am to 10pm EST (Monday thru Saturday) 9:30am to 9:30pm EST (Sunday)  Thank you again for sharing your feedback with us.

{"text":"I should of followed my gut and walked out when I was saw at least 7 tables uncleared from the previous customers while we were being seated, but I thought I would give them the benefit of doubt.  To me, multiple tables with uncleared plates from previous customers screams bad management , which likely leads to bad service and food.   After being seated i waited to see just how long it took from the tables to be cleared. It wasn't until a manager came in yelling At a bus boy and forcing him to go To the tables did they finally get cleared.   A few minutes later our waitress came up and took our order, which was a smooth process.    Drinks were served timely and from there everything seemed ok. That is until the food came...  Orders were delivered for several people at our table with the explanation that they were \"out of dark meat\" (chicken) and that they would give them white meat (chicken) at no charge. At no time did the restaurant  even consider the customer may not have wanted white meat and they just assumed we did.  4 people who had the order of chicken all said that the chicken was very dry and old tasting.   I ordered the \"ultimate bacon cheeseburger\" which was far from ultimate.  Picture a frozen meat patty cooked fast and burned on the edges.  This is what Swiss Chalet considers \"ultimate\", it seems.   The fries were soggy and bland.   If the bad food wasn't enough, the service lacked any focus or care.  After our food was delivered, we never heard from our waitress until after I went to the kitchen to ask for some follow up on some additional needs at our table.  While in the kitchen I asked for some \"Ranch\" (which was a follow up on it never being delivered when our food was given to us). The waiter who I spoke to nodded and said he would he get to us soon.   A few minutes after sitting down our waitress comes up to us and tells us they are \"out of ranch\" . Not 10 seconds later my waiter i asked for the ranch brings to our table! I can't make this up!  The waitress, looking shocked , didn't understand how that happened!  So she goes and finds out what happens and then has the nerve to come back and try to justify to us how she thought they were out.  At this point we are all flabbergasted and the blatant mismanagement and poor service.   So, after we finish with the \"food\" , multiple people at my table ask for the dessert that was included with the chicken dinner special. Guess what? They are out of that too!   So, we asked for vanilla ice cream for an 8 year old at the table, and well, they were out of that as well. They only had chocolate.   At this point we finally had enough and asked to speak to the manager, to his credit, gave us a 20% discount off our order for the \"inconvenience \"   We left and this is never a place we will likely return to , at least this site anyways. I can't remember ever having such a poor experience in a restaurant. From the frozen overcooked food, to the bad customer service and seemingly Overwhelmed or incompetent management .   Multiple major issues exist with this restaurant. Patron beware."}
{"text":"Both my mashed potatoes and chicken were bland. The chicken leg wasn't cooked all the way, there were some pink parts when you come closer to the bone.  If they don't know how to properly cook their chicken, maybe they shouldn't keep up with their business.  Waste of time and money."}
{"text":"The special sauce tastes terrible. Mashed potatoes are mediocre. The chicken isn't cooked properly and it was dry. Enough said. Do not waste your time and money."}
{"text":"Awful - will rethink Swiss Chalet as a whole after seeing how bad this location is. Serving old dry chicken to try to turn a profit.  This has happened on multiple occasions... If I could give this place 0 stars or negative I would"}
{"text":"Was at this location on July 3, 2017 around 7pm. Our server Shirley was awesome and provided great customer service. The male manager, on the other hand was rude, condescending and honestly needs more training on good customer service.  Food was just ok- ordered the full rack ribs and it was dry and lacking in flavor."}
{"text":"Food Quality: 3/5 Service: 2/5 Parking: 5/5 Kitchen Speed: 4/5 Dining Area: 3/5 Value: 4/5  I've always been a fan of the quarter chicken meal.  Its (usually) a quick and easy dinner at a reasonable price.  The dining area is quite dated but acceptable but the service is REALLY hit and miss at this location.  Sometimes you get a server that prompt and helpful, sometimes you get the bitter person who doesn't give a crap whether you enjoy your meal or not.  Now every restaurant is capable of having a good night when things go to plan but its the nights when things go wrong that a restaurant's management can show what difference good management can make.  That didn't happen for us.  We called ahead for pickup.  They have a central call center that the number directs you to but the system was broken so you couldn't reach the call center.  So we called the restaurant to place an order and they REFUSED to let us do so.  Something about having to call the call center and they didn't care if the system was broken.  Way to show agility management staff.  Nothing like blindly following a broken process to show those management skills.  Who cares about client service anymore anyways?!?!  The food (once we got it) was fresh, well cooked, and tasted nice."}
{"text":"Staff are rude. When I took too long to eat my chicken, they went to me \"You are not going to eat your chicken?!\" And then as I left, the same waitress playfully teased me saying \"You can stick your hand in the blender.\" Finally, when I complimented her mug, she didn't listen and thought I was asking for her name, and repeated it over and over again. I was a regular there and the same waitress sat me down, she just out of no where put words in my mouth and assumed I wanted two iced teas. She was like \"two iced teas?\" You just don't get so comfortable and unprofessional like that. Very poor work ethics. The fries are mushy and not fresh. The only reason I'd give it two stars is because they are fair in the pricing. Would recommend you try another Swiss Chalet."}
{"text":"This is my favourite location for takeout. They are so efficient and always get my order right. The quality of the food is excellent as well!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing, consistent taste every time I visit. I highly recommend the ribs. Sometimes I go for the full rack, other times I go for the half rack. If you want the best of both worlds, go for the half rack with chicken combo."}
{"text":"Back at this Swiss Chalet and the prices are slightly higher, but still inexpensive compared to the marketplace overall. I had the Quarter Chicken.  What would you like on the side? Fries or salad or vegetables? I chose vegetables on the side, which meant broccoli and cauliflowers.  White or dark meat? White please. What type of bun do you want? Whole wheat please. What would you like to drink? Which sparkling water do you have? San Benedeto.. OK good. So far, so good. The food was standard Swiss Chalet, came with side sauce i.e. gravy and the bun was accompanied by one container of whipped butter. I am not sure if Swiss Chalet has stopped serving the water and lemon, but we did not receive it. The food was good as is usual at Swiss Chalet  And now about the waitress: She was loud and brash. I am OK with personality and zaniness, but with all due respect and not at all to be ageist, but she was acting like she is running a horse and bogey show or is in charge of beasts at a rodeo. she was so brash about everything. So you WANT the special??? FINE!  We asked to be moved to a booth on the other side of dining section and she felt It is NOT MY SECTION (so??) And so it went...  It is not that I expect any smiles or super duper fake happy waitresses, but at times I thought she is going to devour us or chop our heads off if we interact with her any more!   Finally, the complimentary Wifi worked perfectly and there was plenty of parking there, which one cannot say about the rest of Hillcrest Mall, which like all other malls has been so overbuilt that finding parking, getting in or getting out has become a chore."}
{"text":"It is Swiss Chalet! So I had the quarter chicken, but for a twist went with the shrimp & chicken on rice. The rice was clearly of the packet/dry/whatever variety, but the shrimp was nice (five of them) and the chicken was as good as always. I chose white meat and do not regret it. Service was neither fast nor slow. The price was right as two of us paid no more than $40 including a beer. The portions are not the largest with the plates getting smaller and the bun being on the plate as well, but frankly it was enough food at the end of the day. Finally, the waitress, who was doing a good job and had a personality, strongly recommended we recommend her on the online recommendation form for which we receive a coupon of something. The lady at the entrance and behind the counter by the door looked miserable, but given how our hostess was the waitress the actual hostess made little impact on us. Parking spots where available."}
{"text":"The service us horible my children got cold food and all of us got food pose Ning never came there since"}
{"text":"I tried something new from Swiss Chalet the other day and it was great.  So, I ordered delivery from work and instead of a sandwich piled with beef I got one with a few crumbs of overcooked beef, and watered-down soup.  Past problems have included other examples of chintziness and hair in my food a couple of time in a rows.  The food quality here compared to other locations is night and day.  Unfortunately you can't choose your delivery locations, so I stupidly keep giving them another chance.  No more, which is unfortunate because I usually do like the food at Swiss Chalet.  Something is just terribly wrong with this location the past couple of months.  If you are craving something from Swiss, I would highly recommend trying a different location.  Avoid avoid avoid."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying I haven't had my Swiss Chalet fix in over a dozen years as I've been living in the states for several years now.   I was breezing thru Toronto and staying at a hotel by the airport and ordered takeout/delivery service from this location. I had a half chicken, fries, and an extra side of cole slaw. The taste is just as I remembered it from many years ago. Fall off the bone chicken, cut fries (not that frozen crap), and that chalet sauce!!! I could drink that stuff. So delicious.   Next time back thru Ontario the mighty Swiss Chalet will be officially back in my dining rotation. Best. Chicken. Ever."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Swiss Chalet a lot but I was not exactly impress by their food at this location. For lunch, I ordered the pasta (chicken linguini I think) it tasted too creamy and not enough spices ; the garlic bread that came with it was soggy even though it looked toasted. My friend ordered the burger with fries, the burger was good and there was a lot of fries but the fries was soggy too! I was quite disappointed.   The only great thing was their customer service the waitress was very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I order from here often, I don't know what restaurant my food comes from but it seems like it's very badly prepared, always one thing missing, are used to call and complain now I'm writing it, it seems they just don't double check the orders before they go out, last time they gave me the wrong slice of pie, the corn was dry it was part of some Canadian meal deal, other times they have forgotten my drinks or small things like utensils or the buns, I'm not a big complainer in fact most of my reviews are good about every place so it's disheartening for me to have to write a review like this, I don't want another five dollar voucher from you, I just want my order prepared right, maybe they think people who are ordering out care less but we actually care more as I don't have time every night to cook my own meals as I have a very busy schedule, so when ordering I just wanted to be like when I eat in the restaurant... I could a gave one star but I wouldn't do that, I hope these tips can help the restaurant improve their delivery service, my postal code is M6S5B3 so please talk with whatever restaurants in charge of that and get them in to get it right, I don't think I will be ordering here for the next little while, at one time I was ordering up to three times a week and every time there was something wrong"}
{"text":"I ordered for pick up from this location recently through Swiss' online ordering system. As for getting to the restaurant, you have to make a turn in at an intersection and drive a bit through a plaza to get up front but they have time sensitive parking for take out right in front which is really convenient. I was greeted immediately at the take out counter and my order was already packed up and ready to go. It was a really quick in and out process. If I had to critique anything it's that the fries get a little soggy because they leave the take out containers inside a warming bag so if you want your fries crispy, you should probably eat in or opt for a different side. The containers themselves are actually vented so you're good on that front. Also I think the sauce is a little more watery than I remember which makes it a little harder to get the maximum amount of delicious sauce onto my chicken and into my mouth. Other than that, no complaints!"}
{"text":"Decent place, my family always comes here to achieve the \"Canadian experience\" .   Ambiance-This is a typical Swiss chalet location.   Service- really quite slow, but our server seemed to know a lot of the other customers(good sign)  Food- How you'd expect it to be"}
{"text":"Ehh, this place is just ok for me. I've been here before but a few people in our party wanted to try it out since this restaurant is a popular chain in Canada. We didn't have to wait long at all. Our server was really nice.   I ordered the honey buffalo chicken with mashed potatoes and a side salad. I never got my salad until after I received my meal and that was because I had to ask for it. The chicken was really good but not tender and juicy as I would expect. Anyone that orders chicken gets a little cup of sauce to go with it. I'm not a fan of it but other people at our party liked it. My mashed potatoes were good. Everyone liked their meal. It was ok, not great. Prices were decent and it's in a good location. Nice to try but I wouldn't come back here again."}
{"text":"Been going to this location for the passed five-plus years and it's a fantastic place to go for a meal.  It's never jam packed so it's unlikely you'll be ever waiting at the door for a seat and you'll usually be able to get a parking spot pretty easily.  The inside's very clean and it looks like just about any other Swiss Chalet.  The food itself is VERY consistently good.  I've gone fairly frequently and got the same, good quality food each time (no, not super high end, but I'm okay with that).  I usually like getting the quarter-chicken, white meat with fries or a poutine.  The fries on their own aren't fantastic but having the gravy or Swiss Chalet sauce makes it a lot better anyway.  Their appetizers are really quite good too - Garlic Cheese Bread, Wings, Soup - though many of them are a little on the pricey side.  They used to have an appetizer called Dry Ribs but they seem to be gone from the menu, which is a shame because they were really good too.  During the winter only, they also have Chicken Chowder Soup (it's basically a creamy soup with potato and chicken in it), and I highly recommend giving this a try - I always get it if they have it.  The staff are fantastic.  Most nights, the manager will make sure you are enjoying your meal and the waiter/waitress always do a good job to make sure you're satisfied with everything.  Since I've been going here so often, I can usually tell if someone's new and they are always amazing - so this place must train them fairly well.  If the wait's a little longer than usual, they let you know and if they bring you something wrong or off, they're happy to change it right away (I tend to get fries rather than a poutine - easy fix).  They always bring you warm lemon water to put your hands in just before you're done your meal so that's always nice too.  All in all, Swiss Chalet's a fantastic place to go for lunch or dinner.  Low wait times for food, fantastic staff, good and consistent food quality and a pretty calm environment is their recipe for success!"}
{"text":"Its Swiss chalet..does it need a review?"}
{"text":"Don't order for delivery. They constantly make errors, resulting in at least one person not eating what was ordered or short supplied. Although they offer to correct the error, who wants to wait another 30 - 45 minutes while the rest of the party finish their meal! Don't order a beef and veggie burger at the same time, they don't mark which is which. One literally has to open the burger and take a bite of each to find out which is beef or vegetarian, as they both look the same.  I truly believe they send out their day-old or cold baked potatoes out on orders for delivery. The potatoes in the restaurant taste freshly baked."}
{"text":"I had a late lunch today at Swiss Chalet.  I live near the Dufferin Mall and have been there about a million times but haven't been to this restaurant before (I usually eat in the foodcourt if I'm hungry).  I was seated right away ... but then had to wait about ten minutes before my server acknowledged me and came over to see if I wanted anything to drink.  I knew what I wanted and ordered right away what I have been ordering lately at Swiss Chalet ... a half chicken dinner with corn. It's Weight Watcher friendly (just seven points!) and it was good. The corn was previously frozen but hot. The chicken was a large serving and hot and tender. The roll was warm and the sauce had a nice bite.  After my meal arrived, my server was quick to ask me if I wanted a refill on my pop (and yes, I did)."}

The chicken was hot and tender.  The roll was warm and the sauce (Nadya gave me two but I only used half of one) had a nice bite.  Nadya was friendly and nice and took good care of me."}

The corn was previously frozen and warm. The chicken was a large serving and hot and tender. The roll was warm and the sauce had a nice bite.  The plate was greasy when it arrived so the cook could have taken more care in plating it.  So our food was worth going back for but the service wasn't great.  We weren't offered refills on our drinks when our glasses were empty (as with other Swiss Chalets) and our finished plates were left on the table for a long time after we were done (I was tempted to move them to another table)."}
{"text":"I had lunch at Swiss Chalet in Oakville on Wednesday and had their delicious Cheesy Chicken Bacon Penne.  I was with a client so it wouldn't have been appropriate to blog about it.  And since it was so good, I did want to blog about it so I went to Swiss Chalet for lunch today, which is near where I work at Yonge Street/St. Clair Avenue.  I ordered the Cheesy Chicken Bacon Penne ... and it wasn't as near as good as the one I'd had in Oakville.  What a disappointment!  It was supposed to be topped with melted cheese and it wasn't.  There was a bit of cold grated cheese on top so I mixed it in with the hot pasta and it melted ... the one in Oakville was sooooo cheesy.  I guess someone either didn't know what they were doing or put it out too soon.  There was a little bit of chicken and some of it looked funky (a funny colour so I put it aside) ... the one in Oakville had chunks and chunks of tender chicken.  Finally, there was a some bacon in it ... the one in Oakville was loaded with it.  The portion was so big in the Oakville location that I couldn't finish it.  This is apparently a new product that Swiss Chalet is offering on its menu.  I would have thought they'd have more quality control.  The good news is that since it wasn't very good, I won't be tempted to rush back again and again to have it.  Thania was my server.  She was fast and efficient."}
{"text":"My colleague, Steve, and I had lunch today at Swiss Chalet.  I'd had the Cheesy Chicken Bacon Penne for lunch.  I'd had it there last month and it was delicious ... cheesy and loaded with chicken and bacon.  It was so delicious that I had it a couple days later at the Swiss Chalet near where I work and it was a disappointment ... it wasn't the same at all.  Though there wasn't as much chicken or bacon as the last time I was there, today it was very good ... soooo cheesy.  They need to work on their quality control, though, to ensure this dish is consistent in the same restaurant but also across the chain.   Steve ordered the Slow Roasted Rotisserie Beef Kaiser with cheese.  He said it was okay.  I'd go back for this pasta again!"}

I hadn't ordered gravy and though Edith brought it, I passed on it and focused on the Chalet dipping sauce instead.  The meal was good.  The potatoes were tasty and not salty.  The chicken was a good size and moist.  Though the servers seemed a bit frazzled when I got there about 12:30pm (there only a few tables of people), Edith seemed more focused after a while and took good care of me."}
{"text":"I had an early lunch today at Swiss Chalet.  I knew what I wanted and ordered right away what I have been ordering lately at Swiss Chalet ... a half chicken dinner with corn. It's Weight Watcher friendly (just seven points!) and it was good. The corn was previously frozen but warm. The chicken was a large serving and hot and really tender. The roll was warm and the sauce had a nice bite.  Lisa was my server.  She was really friendly and chatty (she too is doing Weight Watchers and we exchanged tips) and took good care of me."}
{"text":"Ordered from this location this evening through Uber eats and on the app it clearly states quarter chicken dinner with \"Two sides\" and a roll.  I don't really have an issue due to the fact that this is incorrectly stated on the app... But more so with who ever was on the other end of the phone.. I simply wanted to confirm if it was one side or two and the employee very rudely retorted \"no it's one side only !!\" Which leads me to believe that I'm not the only one who has called about this. (The app only allows you to select one, but says two) I told her okay that's no problem, just letting you know the app says two so ...  \"Well it's one!! It says one on the menu!\" After being shouted at I told her \"you're being very rude\" she argued \"No it's not called being rude..\"   Not going into it any further, but avoid this location if you strive for any customer service at all...  All this for a coleslaw ?  Should have went with pizza tonight LOL  ..  Let's hope they don't spit in our food now .."}
{"text":"Swiss Chalet food chain style restaurant. Have had both positive and negative experiences. Today was not so positive. I ordered the spinach chicken salad. The vegetables were not as fresh as they could be, my mushrooms were not washed properly...... Still had some bits of soil on them. My mum had the ribs which were cold when we told our server, her Manager only took 15% off our bill. Not the best customer service......,however our server was nice and did her best, not her fault. Won't go back."}
{"text":"I've often frequent Swiss chalets in Vaughan, but this place is by far the worst in terms of service. We walked in and there was nobody waiting to seat us. Which is fine, so we waited. Once seated, it literally took us 20 minutes before a server came to ask us for water. So we raise our hand and gesture a server to finally come, instead he looks at us and walks away. The service here is disgusting. The server who served us was Jay who was nice. The other server who was Glenn is the rudest person i've had the displeasure of meeting.  When our food finally came, I ordered an appetizer platter, the Baka Chicken  and the Quarter Chicken dinner. Of course, our order came back wrong and we had to wait even longer for our food. I have no words to describe the appalling service and lack of customer service at this location. If my girlfriend did not convince me to stay I would have walked right out. To add insult to injury, the couple behind my girlfriend was seated after us, yet they received their main course before we even received our appetizers. Best part was, when we received our food I found hair in the rice.  Location: 7700 Bathurst"}
{"text":"Ordered some take out $50 worth  Saw the delivery guy down the street 20 min later he was at our door with cold everything  Chicken sandwich cold chicken with bone to plain pieces of bread :( Spinach dip with soggy chips  Fries soggy gross  Chicken and ribs cold not edible  Baked potato was cooked enough to eat  Garvey and Swiss sauce cold  We ordered at 8:36 pm received food at 9:31 pm  We will never order from there again  Very sad that this happened  Pissed about the waste of cash"}
{"text":"The new menus from Swiss Chalet look really nice. The Swiss Chalet service was great, however I am not a fan of the food. The food was just typical and nothing unique. I ordered a quarter chicken (white meat), medley vegetables, and it came with a bun."}
{"text":"I moved into the area on Saturday, and have already been here 4 times.  So convenient and so delicious!"}
{"text":"The service is a bit slow. The food is good, the prices are fair, the decor is to be expected (they really could do something better with some more imagination), but it is the slow service which annoys me abou this particular location. It is not bad service or rude service - that would be worse. Just slow during off peak times and really SLOW during peak times of the day. The staff just seem to spend way too much time idling. Takes forever just to get your order in. Wait time for your food is normal for a sit down restaurant, but if you want to order something, ask for the bill, request water, etc then expect to wait awhile for it."}
{"text":"Went to the Swiss chalet/Harvey's restaurant at Yonge and Eglinton for lunch. This location has been here for years and serve both Swiss Chalet and Harvey's food. It is decorated in the typical fast food style.  Had the double leg entree for lunch. It was the typical Swiss Chalet meal. The service was slow, but it is always slow at this location.  The restaurant was clean including the washroom."}
{"text":"Was here to enjoy the weekend dinner. Loved the rotisserie chicken meal and enjoyed the chicken rolls from the starters. Overall good food and great service!"}
{"text":"The nicest Swiss Chalet I've been to! From open to about 3, the customers are mostly elderly ladies (and a few men) from the neighbourhood. Many are regulars, as the waitresses will call them by name, tell them to go sit in their \"usual\" seats as they are vacant (instead of chauffeuring them there) and gossip a bit every once in a while. Once 3 hits, in come the high-schoolers. Not bad, can get a bit noisy. And come 4:30/5, in come the parents and children for a weeknight dinner out. Again, for me this isn't  problem, but if you're looking for a nice quiet meal, visit www.swisschalet.com and order out (unless home is noisy too). The chicken here is one of the best (people will come to this location from further away JUST for the chicken). The waitresses are all very nice and sweet (almost motherly). The food is pretty good, the caramel pecan cheesecake is (almost) to die for. Overall: a nice place to grab their spinach salad, and maybe dessert."}
{"text":"This is still one of my favourite Swiss Chalet locations. I've been here quite a few times since it's been renovated, never a disappointing experience! Staff is always super attentive and quick to come if it even looks like you might have a slight issue, as well as re-filling your drink as soon as it's empty!"}
{"text":"We really regret eating here... The server was grumpy and smelled as if she bathed in her perfume, at the end of my salad my salad actually tasted like her perfume!!!  We were given small, dried out portions... Our server never checked on us and never offered refills on our coffees. She was an older lady who could hardly understand us. It seemed to exhaust us after being here.  Disappointing since this restaurant is on the same street as our condo..."}
{"text":"Was something going wrong today? It was our first time trying Swiss chalet. Cold gravy soaked sandwiches... Gross.  Bland chicken soup requires much hot sauce to enjoy. Slimy tortilla in my wrap... What!, why?  The topper is their \"famous\" chalet sauce?  All 4 of us tried it, and it was a no, no, no, no. It tastes of fermented applesauce, corn starch, watery dirt. The sauce is down right disgusting. Did someone mess up the recipe?  Lacks any good flavor.  We left very disappointed."}
{"text":"Worst service....I ordered the new poutine dish.  It was great but the service was really bad!!!!! Will keep going to our favourite location on Dundas/Shorncliffe.  Nearly empty and a couple waiting for 7 mins to be seated...yes we timed it!"}
{"text":"I have had a lot of mixed experiences at Swiss Chalet.  For example the location at Kingston Road/Brock in Pickering should be shut down.  Howevet this location in Ajax is great.  It is what you expect from Swiss, nothing special, but unlike others it is consistently good.  Takeout is fast and the servers in the dining room are attentive.  If you want a good lunch that is fairly quick, this is the best spot."}
{"text":"I like Swiss Chalet but the two times I've come to this location I have been disappointed.   My fist time was with take-out of a chicken and ribs combo.  The chicken was very dry and the ribs were burnt.  Literally burnt,  I could not eat it.  The second time we dined in as a family member requested to eat there.  Once again, the food was dry.  Two people at my table sent their food back.  Even the waitress said that wasn't unusual there!!!!  Never going back to this location."}
{"text":"I just had one of the worse restaurant experiences in memory at this place.  I had never been to a Swiss Chalet before but I thought it was a cross between Boston Market and Dennys.  But it's actually so much worse.  The food quality is so far below McDonalds that I was shocked by how much I paid to consume it.  The chicken was a shriveled husk of bird parts, the mashed potatoes were apparently made from powder, the salad was a clump of chopped iceberg lettuce, and the apple pie was a sugary heap of goo.  In addition, the place was dark and uninviting, the server was slow, and the hostess sat down at a table near me because the place was slow and switched between reciting her Spanish homework and singing along with the crappy music piped into the place.  I will NEVER go to any Swiss Chalet restaurant again because just eating a protein bar outside in the cold is better food with better service."}
{"text":"Service was unbelievable! We had to wait 10 miutedm to be seated, desoird 4 waiters walked by our sight. BetkjB that, the waiter took more than 10 minutes to get to us. Definitely do not recommend!"}
{"text":"Unbelievably unhappy staff, the lady who sat us while we were standing kind of sort of clean the table."}
{"text":"My bf and I's go to Swiss!! We always get amazing service. Food is always on par, but the lighting in some booths are too bright. It started to hurt my eyes after a while. I think this is my fav location in Mississauga although I used to serve at a diff location."}
{"text":"We wanted a quick lunch to go from the north bound 400 service center. We picked Swiss Chalet. We were served by a surly young lady who didn't make eye contact. We ordered two chicken sandwiches, 1 white, 1 dark meat. No salads , no fries, just sandwiches. The total was pennies short on $30 !!! We were in a hurry and I just paid and WAITED for the food. The amount of packaging exceeded the amount of food. The sandwiches were both a mix of white meat, fat and grissle. This is a text book of highway (400) robbery.  Never again!"}
{"text":"Personnels sympathiques. Qualité des plats équivalent à la restauration de masse. Frites a eviter absolument. Ce n est pas un endroit indispensable."}
{"text":"Food poisining from undercooked chicken....need I say more?  The manager, Judy, promised a free replacement meal, but I can't bring myself to go back.  Soooooo sick."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner recently and it was just bad from start to finish. Service was slow and distracted. Had to ask for cutlery, napkins, straws, etc. Drinks and appetizers eventually arrived but we ran out of time, so we paid the bill anyway and left. The server was apologetic but our experience here was awful. Won't be returning to a Swiss Chalet any time soon."}
{"text":"I order from the on-line app.  I then follow-up with the restaurant (please remove skin).  They are always so polite and my orders regardless of any requests have always been 100%.  I want to also state that the food is always fresh and hot.   The drivers are always polite.    Just wanted to say \"Thank-you\" for the awesome service.  5 stars ++++"}
{"text":"Husband and I stopped in for dinner after a long work week, no desire to cook and a craving for some rotisserie chicken! We did take out because dining in just takes so much more effort!  We ordered the family meal deal which comes with a whole chicken and four sides (we like deals and we like leftovers). Overall, everything was great! The chicken was nice and fresh, the sides were all fresh - and I've had some not-so-fresh sides from Swiss chalet before. The food came quickly, and they were very safe in preparing the food in a way that kept the possibility of cross contamination (of gluten) down. Even the buns were placed in a separate bag. I see this location has less than stellar reviews but honestly we had a great experience and will definitely return when the mood for some Swiss chalet strikes again."}
{"text":"After swearing off Swiss Chalet for over a year after a bout of food poisoning from the location right near the 401, we decided to try it out again and see how we faired.  As it was the holidays, the festive special was on and of course, that's what both of us ordered. Seeing as how its Swiss Chalet and this experience wasn't much out of the ordinary for what you'd expect at a SC, I won't really comment much on experience. The food was what was to be expected, the fries, tasty as always and the chicken, okay but nothing special. I have an issue with it when I get chicken that looks like it could have used a bit more in the rotisserie - the outside should be golden and brown, not flabby and fatty. The chicken was the worst part of my plate, everything else was good though!  The location itself is clean and the service was friendly and prompt. That being said, I don't see myself coming back to Swiss Chalet as a regular occurrence. Nothing wrong with this location but the food doesn't hold the same appeal it used to."}
{"text":"Located just east of the area known as \"Food Court\" in Whitby, this Swiss Chalet is a busy one. I came here with my boyfriend for dinner a few weeks back after deciding to give them another try after a horrendous drive-thru experience (in which I had to go back in three times for them to get our order right).   This location is definitely frequented by families and in past, we've had issues with screaming children ruining our dinner experience; this time, no little ones (at least not loud ones) but it was still busy for a Tuesday night. We were seated right away and our server came over after a bit of a delay - we could see she was busy but we've been served by her before and she's a very attentive server and took the time to apologize, so we didn't mind the wait this time.  We both ended up ordering the fall special, a 1/3 rack of ribs with a quarter chicken and one with spicy fries and one with regular fries. Our server brought our drinks back right away and our food was out pretty quickly. I've had the ribs at Swiss Chalet before and they're pretty good - they're not ribs like you would get at a Montana's or a place that specializes in bbq, but they're pretty damned good just the same. The chicken was good, the skin was a little mushy for my taste and frankly, the ribs were good enough that the chicken got the shaft and most of it was left on my plate. I got regular fries but I did try some of my boyfriend's spicy fries and they were pretty good. I'm not sure I would get a whole order to myself though, only because the regular fries are soooo good - why mess with a good thing?  Halfway through our meal our server brought drink refills without having to be asked and actually apologized for bringing me a refill when I wasn't done my other drink! I was happy to have more though and we didn't mind. Once we were all done, she brought our bill right away and we were done. We've had a lot of issues at this location (and others as well) with waiting on servers and bills - this time all the timing was pretty good and it all worked out okay. One kind of icky thing... when she dropped off our bill, my boyfriend opened the billfold on the table and then a dead fly dropped down from somewhere on the ceiling into the bill. We both commented that if that had happened during our meal, it would have been massively gross. Perhaps they need to work on sweeping off the light fixtures and ceilings every now and then.  Overall, Swiss Chalet is generally on par and is the exact same experience every time we go. We'll keep frequenting this location and hope we keep getting our favourite server!"}
{"text":"I had a horrible experience at this location yesterday. I went for dinner with my brothers and we each ordered the Festive Special as well as a side of wings. I asked for a multi grain roll three times and when our meal showed up very late, I received a white roll. My brothers asked for extra chalet sauce, that did not arrive until 10 minutes later when the food was almost completely eaten. My brother was eating wings and we wanted to ask for extra napkins but we couldn't find the waiter. The tip of the iceberg was when after paying for our meals we had to ask for our Lindt chocolates which the waiter admitted he forgot about. The restaurant wasn't busy. There was no excuse for this horrible service. I won't be returning to this location. I will go to the one on Dundas in the future."}
{"text":"Best looking swiss chalet! Great food and service. We got back regularly. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I had a bad experience once where I had to report it to the manager.  Since than, going has been awkward when the server is working... we would get ignored or glared at if she was not our server.  Food is as expected.  Sometimes portions is smaller... never more LOL"}
{"text":"Below average. It's Swiss chalet. The only real expectation is that it tastes the same throughout its franchise. The chicken pot pie was just bad. Tasted kinda like plastic but with a mushroom flavour. It wasn't good at all. We also ordered a double leg dinner and it was alright but the mashed potatoes were cold and powdery.   It was sad. Thankfully, the brownie sundae was good. It saved the night, but they should really look into keep their food warm and consistent."}
{"text":"I tried this place a few years back while on vacation in Toronto with a buddie of mine that lives there and she recommended this restaurant to me. I think I had some chicken dinner with mashed potatoes plus salad. It was good and the service was  nice. It will be sometime before I ever return to Toronto but next time I'm there I will eat at SC"}
{"text":"The chicken portion seems to get smaller...hmmm.  The fries were hot, the chicken warm, and the service was ok.  Pricing appears to be getting higher with each updated menu.  I still enjoy the taste and don't go back as often as I was did.  The check was just over $50.00 for the three of us. One glass of  water, one soft drink, a tea, one appetizer and three entrees.  Will I be back? Of course."}
{"text":"Not bad! I had chicken pot pie which was full of meat and delicious. My wife had a chicken, stuffing, mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce, pumpkin pie meal only for 12.99. Very friendly staff"}
{"text":"While in the GTA visiting family, my Mom and I were out shopping and we decided to stop at Swiss Chalet for lunch.  When we arrived, one of the servers seated us pretty much in the North Pole section of the dining room where no one else was, so my Mom asked to be seated by the window.  She pretty much hands me the menus and said, \"Sure, go ahead\" and walks away.  All I'm going to say is I'm glad she wasn't our server!  Looking through the menu, they had a unique menu offering than what I've experienced back home in California.  If you're familiar with the resto, \"Boston Market\" it's pretty much a sit down version of it.  My Mom and I both ordered their Quarter Chicken Dinner, which wasn't a bad deal for just under $9.00 each.  The chicken was good, typical rotisserie style and flavorings.  Other than that, it was just a basic, no frills meal.  Our server was a little scattered all over the place going from one table to another so it was hard to get her attention.  What pissed me off was that while our server was struggling, I had a bird's eye view that first server who tried to seat us and she was yapping it away with whom I'm guessing was the manager, just about the entire time we were there.  Enjoy the yapping and the lack of tipping, lady!  On our way out, we ordered my Dad a Cheeseburger to go.  When we brought it to him, he said he enjoyed it very much.  Hmm, well it did smell quite good in the car ride back!  Overall, Swiss Chalet seems like a nice spot for a standard, inexpensive meal."}
{"text":"As far as service and family friendliness goes, this Swiss Chalet is one of the best. We've been several times now, and we're always impressed by how upbeat and attentive they are, especially when young kids are at the table. The food is your standard Swiss Chalet fare. If you like their chicken and potatoes--it will quickly arrive as expected. The kids options are plentiful, and there is a treasure chest toy to end their meal.   I've also ordered from various SCs in the area through UberEats. This is the only location where there are never hiccups.   I find it odd that there are sub-par reviews for this location. We've never had anything but positive experiences at this Swiss Chalet."}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan of Swiss Chalet. Although I must admit the service is fast and the food is fresh and consistent. I had the chicken Caesar salad this week and I must admit it is quite good. The chicken breast is warm and juicy and the salad is tasty.   My husband tried the rostisserie beef it was tender and much better than expected.  The prices are reasonable too."}
{"text":"Last visit to Swiss Chalet was the second worst meal I have had at Swiss Chalet .That is since I first started going to Swiss Chalet many years ago probably 60 years ago .Found my meal disgusting and could not finish it . Manager was good but that was the Second time I Had a bad meal there but will never eat there again"}
{"text":"I will NEVER go to SWISS CHALET Again!  We ordered the family meal with the ribs, and it was terrible.  It was most likely under a heat lamp to long, our chicken was burnt and the ribs very dry.  Feeling ripped off, we called and spoke to Ram, and he told us he was sorry and granted us a $25 credit toward another meal.    Well, when we decided to cash in on the credit today, the female manager told us no Ram works there, and rudely told us there was nothing on file, as if we would make this shit up, who does that? Especialy not for $25?  Come on?  Furious, we told her where to go. She even went the extra mile to call us back and insist it was not her store that it was one in Whitby.  When we know it was this location - my credit card statement says Ajax..  I guess, she was seeking an apology and it was more important for her to be right (which was the bigger issue I guess) than my initial complaint about the food.  What a response?    Terrible experience - food, dining, and customer service.  Good Luck!"}
{"text":"So I AM just getting back to the states from my recent visit to Toronto area, I have to say this place, Swiss Chalet honestly I received the best service ever in the dining world.  I have never seen a team of workers work so efficiently together.  I could tell there was excellent service from all the team members I could see at least.  This was a location near where I was staying in Mississauga.  Rico Vetrone, was the franchise owner and we happen to chat with him also at the bar there.  I asked a question if this place had any stores in united states. He said no, but a few other countries also have it.  I guess you can look at the design of the place as a super upgraded sizzler. Just the layout looks like a sizzler, like I said though a sizzler that is owned by Diddy and tricked out to look somewhere cool. I had the ribs and chicken combo and it was excellent.  Had a microbrew there they said they had just received. It was excellent as well.  If you are in the Toronto, Mississauga area, check out this particular Swiss Chalet. It is known to be one of best locations of the entire fleet of stores there."}
{"text":"What can I really say about Swiss Chalet that you don't already know? I only get the Quarter Chicken dinner, (white, with fries) but quite often the quality can vary from location to location.  This location served the tastiest version of that classic dish that I'd had in years! The chicken was huge and juicy, the fries were perfection and in abundance, and it came out fast.  I've seen other reviews of this location that are pretty hard on it, maybe I've just had good luck here. I also think SC is one of those places that are best had in the restaurant as opposed to having it delivered.  I was so impressed by this meal that it lead me to write a review about the restaurant, so that should tell you something. I come to this location often, and it's consistently great.  The servers are friendly, the location is 'traditional' Swiss Chalet. Parking is a little tricky in front, but there's a larger lot in the back. I'm looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Server was great but the overall experience was absolutely terrible. Floors dirty, slow service, food came out cold AND wrong! Didn't have time to wait another 40 minutes for another one so I just ate my side and left. Skip!"}
{"text":"Worst service/food ever. Some waitresses do their job well, however some are slow and couldn't care less about you. I went there with my friend and ordered my favourite pesto penne for the first time at this location, and to my surprise it was disgusting. Vegetables missing and dry!!!! asked waitress to bring it back to add more sauce and my vegetarian friend to at least ADDD some vegetables to her pasta.. as it should have already. Her pasta came back with raw vegetables and mine came back colder than the original. We decided to just eat it and not complain since we already waited 40 mins to get our pasta and we were starving. As my friend was finishing her meal, she found a piece Of chicken in her vegetarian plate. We spoke to a manager and told us that he would take the pasta off the bill. He comes back with the bill and says he only took off our app salads, as we still need to pay for the pasta. We asked to speak to the 'boss' which then a woman came to help us. She said we already ate our pasta and there's nothing she can do. It's just absurd that the manager said he would take it off our bill, then comes back and says something else. After a few minutes of arguing with the female manager, she finally agreed to give us a discount on the pasta (which is what we had an issue with- not the $2.99 salad that she took off our bill). She comes back with the bill and somehow the debit machine charged me 4 dollars more than it should have.. which she then refunded me. After a waitress comes back with only 3 dollars, at this point my friend and I were FURIOUS. My friend threw around some swear words and the manager threatened to call the cops. Maybe if you were doing your job right, we wouldn't have to throw a fit.   All in all, save your money and go to a different location."}
{"text":"Establishment was pretty empty when we went in today. We dined in and had to wait 5+ minutes to be noticed and seated. Food was average and came out pretty quick. Overall it was ok server wasn't very outgoing."}
{"text":"The service at this location is hit or miss. My most recent visit was fantastic though and the food was pretty awesome for Swiss Chalet. The spinach dip was very well done. Fresh and cheesey! The roast beef sandwich was also fantastic. My partner had the quarter chicken and was very happy with his meal as well. My only gripe was the fries seemed like bottom of the bag, ends. I wasn't too thrilled about that but luckily the dip had mostly filled me up. I'll be back."}
{"text":"We came here for take out. The restaurant seemed pretty empty. Take out is pretty fast. Service was fine. The take out clerks were friendly & efficient. However I found the size of the chickens small. It would probably be cheaper to get a couple of whole chickens from Loblaws than here. The only thing special about Swiss Chalet is their sauce & I can do without it."}
{"text":"When attending University activities, this restaurant was always the first options for take out, and it never disappoint me. ;)"}
{"text":"I am sad to say this place is terrible. Other chains are quite different.  I came a few months ago and was starving. So I chose this restaurant.  After waiting for a half hour for my order I asked for  the chicken wrap.  When I bit into my food it was very cold and it had bones. I almost choked!  I was mortified. How could they make this mistake???  Very slow service as well.  I wont be returning."}
{"text":"It's a regular franchise. So food is the same at any Swiss chalet. I came to this location before the dinner rush. The restaurant was half empty and they had enough staff working. I stood by the \"wait to be seated\" area for 5 minutes and then went up to the path where the waitstaff would be walking around to serve their customers for another few minutes. It's amazing how there was no hostess or any waitstaff even looked at the entrance to see if any customers were waiting. Truly disappointed and needless to say I'm not coming back unless I have a lot of time to waste."}
{"text":"Take out  I do a walk up order ask for the bog1/2 deal on pies. We don't have that. Off I go to order online to pick up my food, frog really, minimum pickup order for pickup how can you have a minimum pickup charge??!! Is 8.50 the pies are 8.43 are you friggin kidding me!?!? Fine, added a dipping sauce went back in line to get my food, still saved $2 through this ridiculous process...  Pies were good..   11/29 dine in Service was awkward, I had one lady at first and then I got Monica 1/2 way through... Monica was great, very friendly very attentive... I only go back due to convenience... thank god I got Monica in the end, otherwise I'd be ranting again."}
{"text":"I order the chicken pot pie like I always do. The pastry top tasted wrong and almost burnt. The rest was okay and the staff was very friendly but it is not as \"classy\" as the other Swiss Chalets I've been to."}
{"text":"First festive dinner of the year turned out great! Hot food and fast and our server was bang on. Thx"}
{"text":"My mom and I went on a day that was busy and seemed understaffed. It seemed understaffed because it was hard to get someone's attention, either they were busy doing something else or not visible to us.  I got Full Rack of Side Ribs with Sweet Potato Fries. The ribs were okay and the fries were good but I amount of dip for the fries wasn't enough for me.   My mom got the Chicken Parmesan Burger and it wasn't that good, just plain.   Everything was just okay and tolerable."}
{"text":"Consistent food but service wasn't great.  They reminded us several times they would be closing at 10 pm.   We felt rushed and pressured to leave."}
{"text":"If you are a fan of this chain, avoid the Erin Mills Location...I had take out here today and was very dissapointed. Undercooked chicken and over cooked fries sums up my entire lunch. Nothing worse than seeing pink when taking your first bite. I would have taken my meal back but I only have 30 minutes for lunch."}
{"text":"would give a 0/5 if possible. ordered takeout, got there at 10:01 and were locked out, waited 15 minutes in the freezing cold until the last customer left. they had our take out ready, we weren't greeted and definitely didn't here a peep of an \"i'm sorry\". i won't be returning."}
{"text":"We came at an in between hour just after 3:00 pm admittedly but we stood in the lobby for some time & hostess never came. We liked seeing a sign with daily deals eg. Monday $7.99 Seniors' 1/4 chicken dinner special. Wednesday was Family Special, 2 adult 2 kids' dinners, but my 2 kids are now legally adults though still at home; there are NO specials for families with adult age kids! ;_; Oh well. Waitress finally noticed us at the table & got our orders. From then on everything went well, except the sour cream arrived a little late after I got the baked potato with my chicken dinner. Will come again to this Swiss Chalet location & try some more of their daily specials."}
{"text":"If you want Swiss Chalet & you're in this area of Downsview, DON'T come here. Go to the Dufferin- Lawrence location, the customer service there is much better, I'm serious! We have had it dealing with Keele-Wilson, they don't care at all about customers. We have been there in person & had delivery, the delivery is the worst ever. Today we ordered chicken pot pie, caesar salad, Pepsi Next (cause they offered it online & we wanted to try it), 1/4 chicken dinner & baked potato. The chicken pot pie arrived broken into pieces & lukewarm : ( The caesar salad was tasteless & bland. They sent regular Pepsi instead of Diet Pepsi, didn't even phone and ask us what we wanted! To top it off, we weren't even able to speak to to a CSR and complain. The only phone number on the the receipt is for an automated customer service survey! Swiss Chalet you suck!"}
{"text":"We all know what Swiss Chalet is about, so I'm rating this against other Swiss Chalets rather than other places in general. This one has excellent staff , fast service and consistent food. The only reason I'm taking away a star is because it could use a little love in the style department. Some of the newer Swiss Chalets actually are aesthetically pleasing. This one is a little dated."}
{"text":"You know that saying, \"you don't know what you got till it's gone?\" Well that's how I feel about Swiss Chalet. I moved to the States around 10 years ago, and I crave Chalet sauce to this day. And those dry packets you get from the supermarket are not a suitable replacement.   I once had a chicken just as good as Swiss Chalet's... but that was at a fancy French restaurant called Lumiere, in Newton, MA. It did not come with delicious fries, a roll and dipping sauce. And it was much more expensive than a quarter chicken meal (white meat).  Alas, I have to wait for my spring or winter trips home to enjoy the comforts and flavours of my favourite Swiss Chalet. I like this location because it is close to the gigantic AMC movie theater on Winston Churchill, and Sheridan Mall (where I get my Laura Secord fix). It's a treasured ritual that my Mum and I share. And someday I hope to have my own daughter so that we may carry on this tradition. *sniff*   It's also got a really nice staff, fast service, take-out counter, lovely bathrooms and fun game room for the children.  Go there because it is an experience that can turn any vegetarian. Also, if this place ever closes down, by god I will LOSE it and blame you for your inaction!"}
{"text":"We were just here but we left because we were waiting for awhile ( 15 mins ) nodoby came to the front to greet us and give us a table. I don't care if they are busy if they see people waiting in the front , they have to atleast greet us and let us know how long we have to wait to get a table not make us look stupid standing and walking around  just to get your attention. I've been to other locations before and they were all nice and this is the only location that doesn't seem to care about their costumers. I would never come here again -_-"}
{"text":"We had decided to come here for dinner because we've never been to a Swiss Chalet. After coming here, I don't think we'll be going to another one! The place was empty when we got here. It looked nice and kind of reminded me of TGI Fridays in the US. Daughter ordered the chicken and shrimp dinner which she thought was ok. I ordered the Rotisserie Chicken Caesar salad and hubs ordered the Spinach chicken salad which we thought were ok as well. The reason why we weren't paying attention to the food was because there were a lot of flies where we were sitting. We got turned off with that. No matter how good the food tasted didn't matter because we were distracted by the flies."}
{"text":"Very fast service and the waitresses were friendly and quick with the orders. We had 17 people in the party. Proportions are still small and getting smaller every time we come."}
{"text":"Some things never change and l was not disappointed with my meal here. Moving away the closest chicken l have had that resembles Swiss Chalet is the rotisserie chicken from Costco. So coming home had to include a visit here. This was our Sunday lunch place. After church Dad took the family here for lunch. It's been years since l have been here but it was like coming home. We got the family meal deal. A whole chicken, ask them to cut it in quarters, 4 sides, 4 rolls, chalet sauce for under $30.00.  A great deal for tender juicy chicken. Add ribs if you like or wings as a side. They even have dessert. We ordered take out and l could not believe how fast it was. No more than 5 minutes, all boxed up and we were out the door."}
{"text":"Stay away! Very dirty floors and carpets and smells like a barn."}
{"text":"Frequent this location as it is very close to work. Generally quick service with standard high quality menu items. Colleague found long black hair 3/4 thru his chicken salad. Pointed out to waitress after she was clearing the table(no mid meal check in).   Poor very brief apology with no good will offering or visit from the manager. Salad remained on bill"}
{"text":"We went to many swiss chalet restaurant but this is probably the worst because we order 2 racks of ribs they where hard &dry the bun was so hard I could play catch with it. The only good about the place was the fries  how I know because Charles Ingalls & his Side kick Muzaaa didn't talk just chew & swallow like they didn't eat for days LOLA.  This will be  last time here."}
{"text":"I was looking for a quick bite on the healthier side and despite the horrid reviews I decided to come here. I'm going to keep this short and sweet. The service average and the chicken and whole grain roll tasted good. My vegetables did not look fresh especially the cauliflower with multiple browns spots. My salad was brown and wilted and not just a few pieces. 14 dollars for quarter piece, side, roll and a salad is decent but not worth it when the food isn't fresh. I'm pretty certain I won't be visiting this Swiss chalet till these issues are addressed and I see multiple yelpers witness improvements. I would avoid this location.  Ps the taco supreme salad from Wendy's is 100 times better"}
{"text":"Most chain places offer standard fare with average service. I find Swiss Chalet to be one of the better chains but each restaurant can be so different from each other.  This one in particular has been getting progressively worse each time I go.  The restaurant is large, open, and fairly clean. The menu is comfort food. Roasted chicken, fresh cut fries, ribs, and some salads to appeal to the health conscious. My most recent trek here was really poor. The service was ridiculously slow and forgetful even though a third of the restaurant was full. They forgot my friend's request for ketchup and my tea. The chicken quality was subpar. It was bordering on being dried out and it was the size of a deck of cards. I'm guessing that is ok for portion control but I remember the white meat sizes were closer to 3 deck of cards. The chalet sauce is a good old standard and the fries were hot and crispy.  Yucky chicken and poor service... I'll pass on this place."}
{"text":"1 hour later and no order taken yet .... even when they're told ahead of time that a large sports team was coming after lunch hour.  Honestly terrible compared to other restaurants that handled us during a dinner rush.  Found out that the manager mentioned the restaurant could handle the large group ... and the moment we arrived, she barely got one person an hour before we arrived.  Wut?  The restaurant maybe clean but the severe lack of service and organization just made us swear off Swiss Chalet.  In a quick summary... it's a homey old style family restaurant that reminds you of an old steak house from the 90s.  As for food, simple heavily salted fried food.  It has a bit of grease so if you're looking for healthy options, this is not the place for you. Actually, safe to say, it's not for anyone.  In the end, it took over 2 hours of late orders, missing dishes, and forgotten drinks to finally leave.  Best part of the experience, seeing the doors as we exit."}
{"text":"I've been to a few other Swiss Chalet's before, but I'd have to say this location is the best. Why?  First of all the staff are genuinely friendly. They actually remember my face and always give you a warm welcome. Most of the workers are asian so maybe that's why, HA. But still, it's nice to not feel like a nuisance when you go into a restaurant.   Second of all, the food. I usually get the Quarter chicken dinner (dark meat). It's inexpensive and filling. The white meat is drier so I usually go with dark meat since it's more tender and juicy. Also I can't forget the chalet sauce. I know some people either absolutely hate it or love it. I'm in the middle. I used to hate it (yes, guilty) but now I'm liking it more. With the chicken is my usual side, a nice salad with greek dressing. If there was one word to describe this place it would be comforting. It's like an asian restaurant (with the staff) but serving good ol' traditional american food with a ''home-like'' atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Sorry Swiss Chalet, but now that I'm all grown up, your food just bores me to death.  If you don't like chicken - you are doomed to find anything on the menu to eat.   I went for the double leg combo  with veggies. The legs were a lot smaller than I remember and there wasn't a lot of meat after you take away the bones, skin and grisly bits. The veg had clearly been microwaved too long. The white roll with whipped butter was probably the highlight of my meal.  What saddens me is this cost $17 with tax, tip and a diet coke. I could have bought 2 delicious Korean meals for that price.  Our server was great for the first 15 mins we were there, but she pulled several disappearing acts when we wanted to order our meals and when we wanted to pay.  Argh."}
{"text":"Worst swiss chalet location ever!!  Came here during lunch time on a weekday and it was busy, but the wait for food was ridiculously long. Waited at least 30 mins for our food to arrive. Tried their new crispy chicken. The batter was flavorful but when I got into the chicken meat there was chicken blood. For sides I ordered their Mac and cheese and Caesar salad with dressing on the side. The waitress didn't tell me they ran out of Mac and cheese until she started bringing the food out for my coworkers...??!?! I said I'd go with fries instead. My plate then came with Caesar salad, but dressing was not only mixed in but also drenched in sauce. I was rushing to get back to the office so I didn't have time to send my food back. But the salad, I had to ask for a replacement or else there'd be nothing else from my meal that I could eat. Awful. Essentially I paid $15 for fries and a side salad.    I was rushing to get back to the office so I didn't bother complaining about my horrible horrible experience.  Never come to this location."}
{"text":"Love the variety on the menu and kids had a great choice . Was so disappointed with the food . Ordered myself the thanksgiving dinner and they were out of potatoes and pumpkin pie :( I asked for a baked potato with chives but didn't come with it , the chicken was half pink and really wasn't nice. Although I did help my kid eat his meal as I was starving ha ha . Kids enjoyed their food . Husband had beef dinner which he didn't like as beef was full of fat and he couldn't have potatoes either . Staff were all very helpful and did a great job so that was a bonus ."}
{"text":"Ordered the Family Value Pack (6 legs meal), and then took it home to find out they gave me the Family Pack (whole chicken meal). This doesnt work when trying to feed 4 adults and 2 kids.....  Needless to say, we won't be back"}
{"text":"I don't want to write an in depth review of Swiss Chalet, because I figure most people know what they serve and are more just looking for a location rather than knowing how good it is. For those that don't, you must not be from Canada :), so I will lay it out like this; Go there for the chicken (maybe the ribs), their chalet sauce is what people remember about it (personally I love it), and they are extremely cheap for a decent meal. Why I wanted to review this place is because I have had some spotty service issues, but in the end the situation has been rectified. Depending on the server, some of them are really good, while others you don't see in between ordering, when the meal comes out, and when they clean up. I have complained about the service on their survey that you do online that comes with a confirmation code on the meal receipt. When I have complained the manager was quick to respond to the survey and offered to help rectify the situation. It's hard not to get mad when you are not being served to your expectation, but unless its consistent, I like to give places another chance. If the manager is willing to go the extra mile to keep you as a customer, I can appreciate that."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and was disappointed.   I'll start with the only good part, which was service. Our server was hospitable and constantly checked up on us to see if we were enjoying the food. He would go out of his way to ensure we received the best dining experience possible, which we greatly appreciated. However, we will not return as the food was horrible!!!   We started with the four cheese spinach dip, which was quite bland. The ratio of the dip to chips was also very very off (we had A LOT of leftover chips). My girlfriend got the veggie burger and it was extremely burnt. The fries were good though. I ordered the quarter chicken and half rack. It was the smallest half rack I've ever had, and it was all bone. No meat whatsoever. Both meats were extremely dry too. Did not look like what it was advertised in pictures. At all.   Too bad the food wasn't good or else I would come back here whenever I'm craving their specialty gravy with chicken. Kudos to great service though."}
{"text":"Have not been to a Swiss Chalet for over 2 years and it was as I expected...amazing!  I had the festive meal (quarter chicken with stuffing, fries, and cranberries). Dipping sauce, also amazing. And a roll. The only thing wron with this is that we did not receive the chocolates and the free meal coupons!  Otherwise the appetizer spring rolls were good and the pieroggies too.   There us enough parking but the lot is shared with a plaza if stuff as well as the neighbouring Harvey's. The Harvey's lot is a little cramped if you go when it is busy. Getting in and out of here is pretty easy. You can go back onto Keele or St. Clair."}
{"text":"Swiss Chalet dipping sauce. Check. Quarter Chicken. Check. 1/3 Ribs. Nope. 1/2 Ribs! Free upgrade during the holidays! I ate it all. It was wonderful. $15.99. Always a solid place to eat."}
{"text":"So the rotisserie chicken is good. It has shrunk over the years, but it's still good. Mainly still good because of the dipping sauce. The swiss chalet dipping sauce is totally amazing and cannot be duplicated. Yes, you can get the powdered do it yourself mix (for those of us who do not live in Canada) but you need to experience this for yourself in person. You can dip everything in this. Meat, fries, bread, you name it. You can do it. Anyway, you can eat in or get take out. It all tastes good. They also have sandwiches and ribs. A Canadian staple."}
{"text":"Awful. Do not go here. Ordered take out, took 30 min. Place was empty. All the staff on their cell phones. So disappointing."}
{"text":"They must use the smallest chickens they can find.  Maybe they're using budgies.  Fries were made palatable by dipping in the sauce.  The bun was stale and came with one butter.  The best part was the ample parking in the plaza lot."}
{"text":"The only good thing in this location is the service. The chicken is getting smaller and smaller in these 5 years. And the prices is getting higher and higher. The food quality is going down to the drain. Even buy one get one free is not worth the money."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Swiss Chalet for almost 2 years, try their Christmas Chicken/Rib combo....not bad...with scratch card included in the combo"}
{"text":"Okay food at Swiss Chalet.    I came here back in April and had the Rib + Dark Meat Chicken w/ Poutine Combo for $22 post-tax.  The poutine was decent."}
{"text":"So we celebrated my sons birthday here last night and I got to try their new dish to $16.99 a pasta, fried coated with garlic bread. It was a big meal and I ended up giving half of it to my aunt and even had a take home lolzz.. let's get to the taste, aesthetic appearance is appealing, smell is appetising;however, the pasta is spicy for me and I'm not a fan of spicy dishes..all in all I'll give it a 7/10 because the chicken and garlic bread was okay.My son also had fun is it worth the money? Well if you love spicy pasta then yes and you can share it!"}
{"text":"A great Swiss Chalet location.  The staff are friendly and the food is tasty.  Don't listen to the previous bad post about this restaurant.  It was written when the place first opened and as far as I can remember Swiss Chalet has never served pizza before.  I wouldn't trust their comments.  A good family restaurant or a place to take out. Yes it's more expensive that a \"bird at Sobey's\" but worth it."}
{"text":"Service is great. The prime rib is non edible. I took one piece and spat it out. See attached photos. It was like sliced and appears to be baked or put into a microwave. I blame myself for ordering prime rib at a chicken joint. Shame on me. Azz would not describe the prime rib."}
{"text":"The Swiss Chalet on Queens Quay delivers non-edible food. If you order past 9:00pm they deliver the chicken that has been sitting on the rotisserie all day; dried out, hard skin and burnt.  The chicken was shrivelled and I could take the chicken and knock it on the table from how hard it was. This is the third time I had it delivered like this from them- and each time a formal complaint was made. Nothing changes. Management clearly have nothing under control over there, and the quality assurance of their food is garbage.  Kedurah Mayers, General Manager, you need to step up or step out."}
{"text":"I can't complain at all about this swiss chalet location. Everything goes as you would expect from a swiss chalet chain. Friendly staff, good service and decent food. Nothing bad, nothing wrong, but like a lot of other chain restaurants... there is nothing that stands out.  You know exactly what your getting from swiss chalet and this place does just that."}
{"text":"We have eaten at other Swiss Chalet locations many times and were expecting the same decent (not amazing, but pretty good) food we usually get.  This location was very run down and dirty (food splatter on the walls, dirty seats and table). Our chicken was so dried out that even the chalet sauce couldn't hide the texture, and the fries were dried out, hard and over salted.  Our buns were so hard that we didn't eat them, and instead laughed at the noise they made when we hit them on the table.  We had to cancel our plans to shop after eating at this location because all three of us ended up being very sick.  We will never return to this location."}
{"text":"The Best Swiss Chalet! (we go here when visiting my in-laws)   Always on the ball, salads always crisp and fresh west coast salad is amazing at this location (at least it has been for me, other locations has been wilted), quesadillas always crispy and not soggy, fish n chips nice and crispy.  They are always very busy."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite on my way home with my boyfriend and everything was pretty typical. Our server was quiet but pleasant however did not offer or bring refills. Didn't bother asking but the food was great. Service was quick and within a good time frame. Will be back for more quick bites."}
{"text":"Swiss chalet always forgets something when I order for delivery. I suggest that they have someone recheck the receipt and the food before it is delivered to make sure everything is there. I don't want to have to call the restaurant again telling them they forgot something. Other than than, Swiss chalet is one of my favourite restaurants"}
{"text":"Frankly the whiners do not give this branch justice. This particular branch has the best quality chicken. Unlike other branches this one cooks their meat (is not pink) but doesn't overcook. The staff are all very friendly and will bend over backwards for any and all special requests.  The manager is exemplary and is driven to have his team provide top tier service at all times. The passion that is shown by his team is what other sites should strive for. I use this branch as a benchmark and it has never come off short of my expectations. Out of all Mississauga, this is hands down the best quality food, the salads are crisp and fresh, the pirogies are cooked to perfection and the ribs are fall off the bone extra ordinary.  Highly recommended for all families, the gems worth the trip for any that have a desire for dishes that are a cut above the rest of the chains.  This comes from one that has been a steady customer for well over a decade."}
{"text":"Swiss Chalet I assume is Swedish for mediocre food and mediocre service... if that sounds good than you should come on down to this location!  This is Swiss Chalet so my expectations were set accordingly. The restaurant was empty and you could tell that the food had been sitting under a heating lamp for way to long. Mass producing fries to accommodate their all you can eat promotion has severely effected their quality.  Our waiter was abrupt, snippy and inattentive. My friend ask for a refill on his Pepsi and he rolled his eyes and let out a rather ridiculous sigh.  When it came to the cheque, he charged us a different amount on our credit card than what was listed on the bill. He pointed it out to us and then seemed flustered and annoyed that there was a discrepancy of $0.50."}
{"text":"World's slowest Swiss Chalet. They orders are never correct or on time. Even if you call ahead or order online it's still late. Then food some times looks like it's been tossed around."}
{"text":"This by far is my favourite Swiss Chalet location, they're fast, friendly and efficient.  I don't have a ton to say about them, because I'm primarily a takeout customer and 100% of the time it's ready as soon as I get there or even earlier. And when I had issues with the app, they resolved it instantly. Their customer service is amazing.  The only flaw is getting there, because you have to go around a gas station and it's a bit awkward, but it's worth it.  The food has always been perfect, fries aren't soggy, chicken is always moist, wings are perfect. That's all I really order, but it's always good, so why order anything else.  Short-no waits, good food, nice staff. It's a great Swiss Chalet."}
{"text":"I don't normally go to any Swiss Chalet, but my SO has gotten me into going occasionally. Generally I enjoy Swiss Chalet, I'll get the wings or the salad. However this location, we've been to about 6 times now and it's always a long wait and I feel like I'm being interrogated by the person on cash.  In terms of food, it's been relatively consistent with the chicken. Moist, cooked well. But the fries have also been consistently soggy, which isn't something anyone looks for in fries.  It's been a few times now that we end up waiting 20 minutes longer and this most recent time the guy was waiting 30 minutes. Not to mention they've been rude and unapologetic about the slow service. This will be my last time at this Swiss Chalet. I'm not a fan of leaving negative reviews, but I've gone to this location enough and had enough experiences to not leave a positive one."}
{"text":"The Swiss chalet on west drive is crap. Every experience we have had there is terrible. I love Swiss chalet but the servers here at this location are rude and mean. I always go to the Bovaird or Airport road locations when I want Swiss Chalet. Don't go to this one service is 0 and food maybe a 1 out of 10."}
{"text":"It's Swiss Chalet so what do you expect, its the same everywhere.  I don't agree with Connie that Ontario's are any better than the rest of Canada.  I moved from Calgary and the chicken tastes the same here and there.  This location in particular has great staff and the restaurant is always clean.  The last time I was in getting take-out their debit machine was down.  When I came back with cash the manager had given me some free apple pie as an apology for my troubles.  A fantastic way to keep a customer coming back (too bad the apple pie was terrible though)."}
{"text":"I like to hit up Swiss Chalet once in a while as its a nice alternative to something fairly quick that isn't a burger. This location has a drive-thru which is handy to pick up dinner on my way home from work. The food is always consistent though the customer service leaves something to be desired.   For an almost fast food establishment I really can't complain about much."}
{"text":"I wrote another review on a different Swiss Chalet location on Eglinton.  I wanted to point this one out because it is just a good but the service was especially tremendous!  We were travelling back from a hospital visit and I was upset and tired.  I was ready to break down.  The waitress was just lovely to me and checked to see if I was okay.  She ensured our food came quickly to order and came back to check on me.  I cannot tell you how that act of kindness brought me back!  The food was great and much needed.  The kindness and great service just made it that much better.  I am sorry I did not get her name because I would be singing her praises.  Looking forward to another visit to that location and hopefully I will see her again!"}
{"text":"I generally like Swiss Chalet in most locations because you know what you are getting and it is pretty consistent.  I especially like this location because I have always had good meals (of course I must confess I am addicted to the quarter chicken and seldom try other items).  The service is good and the food is tasty.  The takeout is fast and consistently good too!  I have good memories of this location back when I took the Go Train.  I would be tired and hungry and this location is across the street from the Go Train.  It was convenient.  So this location is near and dear to my heart..... oh!  That reminds me, I should also write a positive review from the O'Connor location!  They have been great too!  PS.  Kudos to their young staff member who patiently dealt with a unhappy customer.  He constantly complained while waiting for his takeout.  She and the other staff replaced his order to ensure it was hot and were very diplomatic despite his poor behaviour.  They managed him quickly thus making it easier for the other customers who were waiting for their orders.  Bravo!"}
{"text":"I love Swiss Chalet and am helpful they tend to be very consistent.  I notice that this one had a bar area.  We didn't use it but it does look rather nice and I don't often see that set up in a Swiss Chalet.  The service and the food was very good at this location.  We enjoyed dinners.  They are fast with either sit down or takeout dinners."}
{"text":"Food is quick, service depends on the waiter. Affordable food however they don't have sweet potato fries or deep fried fish fillet anymore."}
{"text":"This is the nicest Swiss chalet I've been into- well lit,  nice decor. Once I walked in there was a chef talking to the customers so that's one impressive sign. Manager gave me a the spc deal for free app even though they don't accept it anymore. Coconut shrimp was amazing. Better than frozen ones I've had in other restaurants.  The wait was a little long,  they were low on chicken.  I didn't made the wait,  it just means I'm getting it fresh!  Quality of food is impressive.  Service is a little slow tho"}
{"text":"In comparison to new Swiss Chalet branches, this location is mehhhhh. Although in chained restaurants, they all follow the same recipe and ingredients, but when food is made with care, you CAN taste the difference. The best one I've had I previously reviewed, located in Yonge and... 19th?  I am a regular at Swiss Chalets, but for the first time I decided to be adventurous and try their new featured honey-garlic special. I think swiss chalet is running out of ideas on how they make their chicken. It's really nothing speical, although I would recommend smothering the speical chalet sauce with the honey garlic. For specializing in rotisserie chicken, Swiss chalet is a monopoly, because they know this, they don't really put much effort into innovating their flavour... I guess the honey garlic would be a good baby step.   Swiss chalet use price strategy to position their product to go against their competitors :\"always so good for so little\"... for $15 a meal, it is inexpensive if compared to other big-chained restaurants like Jack Astors, but $8 can get you a whole darn chicken from Loblaws."}
{"text":"We've all eaten at Swiss Chalet.    Most of us will agree that the food is quite decent, price is affordable, and decor is so/so.  I feel this is generalizable across all of their locations.  However, I truly truly feel that the service varies above all other factors. This particular restaurant at the corner of Burloak and QEW has treated me and my family with the best service of any location we've visited.  Trust us, we've been to many different Swiss Chalets and to this particular location at least a dozen times. And we've had great service at this location at least a dozen times.  Not sure if their staff training program is different, or just lucked out with excellent staff, but I'm impressed!"}
{"text":"I don't frequent Swiss Chalet that often but just could not resist the $14.99 Dinner for 2 Special.  Food was quite standard, at least it did not go downhill over the years. Green Side Salad was quite fresh but if you are a big eater, you can probably ate the dinner for 2 all by yourself.  Service was though friendly and attentive even our bill was not too big.  And it is right next to Harvey's. One can pick up a burger if still hungry."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this Swiss Chalet's location for years.   Good for a quick meal. Nothing too fancy. Service is a little stiff but quite attentive.  I would stay away from the ribs though, the last few times it had been really dry. The chicken though never disappointed.   Over the years, I can see the size of my chicken growing smaller...... Maybe one day I can eat a whole chicken by myself."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite chicken places.   We have chicken cravings once a month! The chicken soup is always on my order being very generous with the ingredients.  Farzi is my favourite waitress here. She treats you like family!"}
{"text":"Came here to fulfill my once every 2 months craving of Swiss Chalet Chicken. The restaurant is pretty large compared to some other SC restaurants I have been to.  The product is similar to the others in the chain so no surprises here.  Our favourite is the chicken soup and the double leg dinner with lots of fries.  Parking is easy because of the huge parking lot.  Decent value.  Will be back in 2 months!"}
{"text":"This place is nothing special. Better than the Swiss Chalets downtown. You go to the counter here, order, and they ring you up as it's an express location. The facilities were clean and it sizes of the chicken were slightly bigger than the downtown ones."}
{"text":"The nostalgia of eating at  Swiss Chalet brought back so many great memories of growing up in Niagara Falls, NY and heading north of the boarder for all kinds of activities.  Having been removed from that part of the world for over 20 years,  going back on a work trip put Swiss Chalet at the top of the must stop list.  Entering the front door the aroma coming out of the kitchen brought all those memories to the forefront.  I was quickly seated, by a friendly server in a corner booth.   I ordered the quarter chicken dinner with a side salad and veggies.  The meal came out quickly and was everything I remembered it to be.  The rotisserie chicken was well cooked and well seasoned and well presented.  Don't forget the sauce .... Chalet sauce that is.   There is nothing better to dip your chicken, fries and even veggies in then their Chalet sauce.  Thank you for the wonderful memories Swiss Chalet, old and new!"}
{"text":"This is a very typical Swiss Chalet, worthy of the praise and criticism that such a statement entails. The food is very much on par with any Swiss Chalet across the province and thus is, in my opinion, a bit bland and boring but cost effective and provides a good dining atmosphere for families or groups of friends.   The plus side of this particular Swiss Chalet is that the staff here is actually more friendly than most. I like all of the people who have served me. In particular, there is a delivery driver (I don't know his name but he's a middle aged man with grey curly hair) who is very friendly and awesome! The service staff, though friendly, is oftentimes a bit lacking in service but never lacking enough that my whole experience has been ruined. However, it's typical that at least once per trip there will be a minor inconvenience such as an empty ketchup bottle, a forgotten order of chalet sauce, an incorrect condiment on a burger, etc. Never anything big, but always something small.   If you need a quick place to get a decent meal at an affordable price, this place is good for you. If you're looking for something special, perhaps consider looking elsewhere."}
{"text":"The ribs are good but not that impressive. The service are too bad and I can't figure out how could they let such a sulky woman work here. Sigh..."}
{"text":"I'm from the West Coast so Swiss Chalet is new to me, but I can't understand what the big fuss is about. It's basically the same as Denny's. I went to this particular Swiss Chalet a while ago and it was pretty disappointing. The staff were super nice but the  food tasted like it was plastic and microwaved. No thanks."}
{"text":"Since it is right around the corner, decided to give this location a try as I was in the mood for some rotisserie chicken.   First off, there was a wait to be seated sign but no one came to seat us. Eventually we just sat ourselves after waiting for about 4 or 5 minutes. Secondly the service overall was a bit slow and lackluster.   In regards to the food, it was fine, but the only other Swiss Chalet I've eaten from in First Canadian Place, is substantially better. I don't think I'll be back to this location - too many food options in the area - maybe take-out here and there."}
{"text":"This is a Swiss Challet Express store - it just happens to have a couple of tables in the back. For neighbourhood folk its perfect, though we catch the occasional \"tourist\" looking for a full-service restaurant... which this isn't.  There's no table service as there aren't any waitperson's. Convenient, as there is no \"tip\" button on the Interac machine :-)  But, what they do have is that extra good swiss pidgin n' juice that all Canadians have come to know and love.  It gets better, and greasier. They have free Wifi  Oh, and the driver's that mingle. They're nice folk."}
{"text":"Got to the restaurant with a few friends at around 1pm. Wasn't too busy. The waitress took a long time to get to serve us. We eventually got served, and I ordered the quarter dark meat chicken dinner with seasoned rice pilaf. When the food came I was surprised to see such a small portion. I tried their \"signature\" dipping sauce and was not impressed. Although the chicken was moist, the meal overall was salty. The service was also sloppy. The restaurant didn't appear to be too busy, yet it took the waitress forever to give us the bill."}
{"text":"Wildly inconsistent. Worst experience recently is that our order took nearly an hour and then half our delivery order was missing so we called the driver who gave us the direct phone number for the store (which isn't available online, ridiculous), and we were kept on hold for ten minutes. Called from another phone and got a reply right away so they were clearly trying to ignore the issue. They said a replacement order would  be sent in 15-20 minutes and it took nearly another hour. Quality is inconsistent, they have lost our business."}
{"text":"Came here with a large group last weekend, had a mediocre experience. The food was fine and the portions were quite generous, but the reason for the 3 stars is because of the service.  The restaurant was by no means busy, yet our food came out quite slow and it was difficult to get a hold of our server. I figured that since we had a large party, the food would come out together and may take longer--which was fine. However, when ordering take out to go at the end of the meal, it took upwards of 20 minutes for one quarter chicken dinner come out. Not only that, it took at least 10 minutes for the server to give us to-go boxes when asked.   A redeeming moment, however, was when my meal came out without the bread and I was given a couple slices extra.  All in all, I wouldn't have mind coming again if it wasn't for the wait."}
{"text":"This is a fine place to have a rotisserie chicken fix. It's close to home and there are usually no lineups. I have no complaints."}
{"text":"The staff is friendly and they always have a smile but The chicken at this location is very dry you need a lot of soda or beer to wash it down.   I don't know if its because its a Harvey's/ Swiss Chalet  Also the floors are VERY slippery"}
{"text":"Good decent food. Crispy wings were extra crispy and their quarter chicken is decent. I liked the gravy but not a fan of the Swiss chalet sauce."}
{"text":"This place has been around for quite sometime.  My boyfriends parents took us here right before we flew out of Canada.  To say the least, the service is phenomenal!!!! The servers were so cute and nice and VERY catering to your every need.    The food was good- fresh and unique.  I had the chicken and it was delicious and moist.  Great deals on beer as well with your meal! I will def. be coming back the next time we are in the area!!"}
{"text":"I love rotisserie chicken, I mean who doesn't?   But they are great at overcooking it to death, on a real consistent basis, at any of the restaurants, not just this one.   The legs are almost always overcooked to the point where the me to is dried up and cemented to the bone.   They have yummy chicken soup and nice spring rolls as appetizers.   But if the chicken is overcooked, I mean, why would you come back?"}
{"text":"A family restaurant have been always busy during the weekends. Service is good. It won't disappoint you if you have friends or families gathering. Won't break the bank. Lol."}
{"text":"I went here last night for a quick dinner after a day of moving.  It seems like this location does mostly delivery, as their dining room looks rather empty but their kitchen was very busy packing up food. I was there with my parents and stood at the entry for a while to be seated.  The person who appears to be the manager noticed us a couple times and after looking at him in the eye he told us to help ourself to any table. I grabbed a few menus and went to take a booth -- what lousy service!  At this time I already know that this server will not get a tip. Later to my mom's horror she saw something disgusting in the kitchen (the booth where we sat  had a clear view into the kitchen) -- it was a good thing that service was so slow for us to notice this: There was a worker who was rinsing plates over the sink and wiping them with a towel. No soap, no scrubbing, no steaming hot water, just a quick rinse and a wipe from who knows what kind of towel or rag they were using!  I saw it too and we quickly ran out and went to the sushi restaurant next door where the service was quicker, so much friendlier and the place was clean and hygenic, unlike the Swiss Chalet.  I will never ever dine here. No wonder why they do mostly delivery and take out business."}
{"text":"Used our buy 1 get one free quarter chicken dinner meal. Tasted ok, nothing special. Service was wwhat-evver!  Don't really want to come back here again."}
{"text":"Prices are a bit high for a fast food restaurant. Service is great, relatively still cheaper than eating at a fancy restaurant but also better service than Mcdonalds. Would still recommend. Expect to spend about 20 bucks per person there if you are looking to feel full with a drink or two."}

{"text":"I had to settle for commercial Poutine and it was quite yummy!  Me and my cousin were craving Poutine but did not want to get stuck in the traffic from our hotel in Markham to the more established Poutine restaurants located closer to downtown Toronto.  BTW, traffic in Toronto is absolutely horrendous, and this is coming from somebody who works in NYC!  NYC traffic is quite bearable compared to the logjams in Toronto.   So we drove to at least there places around our hotel only to try out this chain restaurant, which luckily had the famous dish on the menu.  The best aspects of the poutine was how the cheese curds melted ever so slightly from the warm gravy smothering the entire dish. Creamy yet salty this medley of cheese and gravy was delicious.  The fries were solid, if not unremarkable.  I would think the more specialized Poutine restaurants would have higher quality fries which would just put it over the top.  Overall Swiss Chalet's Poutine was good.   Now I see what the whole hype is about!"}
{"text":"The new location on the south side of Lawrence uses the \"design\" being rolled out everywhere. The result is way too loud. All hard surfaces means you cannot hear the person across from you. After 10 years, our regular Friday night crowd won't be coming here much more. :-("}
{"text":"The service was slow, waitress was friendly and nice but didn't seem like they know the menu and forgot few items. (Kid's drinks, utensils and side orders).  Food wise my 1/4 dark meat chicken was over cooked, dry and was bitter.   I probably would prefer go to Galito over Swiss Charlet.  It could be the location but over all, I was disappointed and price wasn't that cheap."}
{"text":"What can I say? It's a Swiss Chalet. It seems they haven't changed their menu much in 10 years and it shows. The food was alright. I got the quarter chicken (dark meat) with poutine. I still don't see  the appeal of the Swiss Chalet sauce but the chicken tastes good without it. Poutine was good too although some of the cheese curds were still cold because they didn't put enough hot gravy over it. Service was okay."}
{"text":"I come to the Hurontario/Eglinton location often, as its right by my house and there is always 2-can-dine coupons in my mailbox! The servers are always friendly and the food comes out quickly, I have no complaints! The only thing I've noticed is sometimes the staff are hard to wave down."}
{"text":"I think this review can stand in as representing the breadth of my Swiss Chalet experiences. As the saying goes, if you've seen one you've seen 'em all, and few restaurants deliver as high a level of impregnable homogeneity as Chalet Suisse. In fact, that's part of its appeal.  Swiss Chalet came into this world roughly the same time my father did. Like my father, it's a mainstay of suburban life and a lousy inclusion on a first date. Unlike my dad, they produce millions of gallons of delicious savoury sauce per year, and are owned by Cara foods. Swiss Chalet also lacks my dad's trademark moustache and cynicism.  At Swiss Chalet one orders the quarter-chicken dinner with dark meat a multigrain rolle and one side. I personally think it's foolish to get anything but a baked potato, but the choice is yours to make. I have wrecklessly experimented with other options on the menu, with varying degrees of success. Chicken pot pie, bad. Ribs, OK. Pierogies, decent.   Anyway, stick with the chicken. This is a solid kid-friendly place on King street west. It's usually packed with octogenarians around 5pm, if you're into that kind of thing.  Obligatory Title Pun: SWISS: two points.   Menu Readability: Prices ending in 99. Need I say more?  Need to mention: You can buy Chalet sauce if you are so inclined.  What this place teaches me about myself: I must admit, I'm a sucker for the Festive Special."}
{"text":"Wow, now I definitely understand what the previous reviewers meant about this Swiss Chalet location!  To begin, the service is extremely slow! This must be the slowest service I have ever received at any restaurant that I've been to this year. Despite my waitress being kind, she kept forgetting items such as our water, straws, napkins, etc. We had to constantly try to call our waitress and at one point we actually had one person go look for a waiter to help us. It was pretty ridiculous.  However, the food was really good! I got the chicken and shrimp plate and wow it exceeded my expectations. This plate comes with a piece of quarter chicken, shrimp pieces, rice, a bread roll and the Chalet sauce.  The only reason I gave two stars was because the waitress was nice despite giving horrible service and the food was really good. I won't return to this location again, but I would definitely get the dish I got again at another Swiss Chalet location.  P.S. I also tried the 1/2 rack ribs and mashed potatoes, it is also really good!! Definitely wasn't a fan of the honey garlic wings (felt like it was store bought and just dipped into the sauce)."}
{"text":"Popped in last night for a quick bite. It's great to go in, get a decent meal and be out in less than an hour. Two of us popped in and we ordered the new, honey garlic quarter chicken combo. $11.99 gets you: soup (choice of a chowder or their signature chicken) or pie; quarter chicken meal ($1.50 extra for white meat), side dish, slice of garlic bread. The meal itself was great....chicken was moist, sauce on top of the chicken was pleasant enough (although the additional sauce you get on the side is a tad too sweet), the fries excellent (and hot!), garlic bread was a disappointment. All in all,  great meal for a great price. Our server (who was also the hostess and bus person) was friendly and attentive. She was excellent. Don't remember her name, but we were there on Jan 28,2013 @ 8:15pm...she was working in the bar area. FANTASTIC !"}
{"text":"If I could rate something lower than a single star, I would rate this zero. I've been to Swiss Chalet approx. 15 times and have never sent food back. Today, I had to. Two of us wandered in and I ordered a quarter chicken white meat, with fries. My dining companion ordered the roast beef on a Kaiser.  We waited a normal time frame for our meal to arrive, but when it did, I was totally grossed out. My chicken was pink on its edges....and when I peeled the skin back it was completely off-putting. The meat under the skin was mottled pink...blotches of red and pink mixed across the top of the meat. I was totally grossed out. Not sure if it was still uncooked in spots, or whether it was a very poor quality cut, but it was totally gross. I'm surprised a staff member would even bring it out as you could see the colouring even without peeling the skin back. I flagged down our server and she came over and had the gall to say \"all our chicken is cooked thoroughly\". I told her that I didn't care...I wasn't eating it and that I never said it wasn't cooked. She quickly changed her tune and said \"of course I'll take it back\". She brought over a separate plate for me to put the meat on....and off she went. She returned a few minutes later with a chicken I was expecting originally.  My friend said his roast beef was \"excellent\", but after seeing my chicken breast, he said that he'd never return to this location again. Service was average. Our server was adequate, although her initial response to my concern was way off base. Don't think I'll go back, unless I need to lose weight and need a bout of food poisoning to shake those few last pounds. Yikes !"}
{"text":"Was on the east end of town decided to try this swiss chalet.. they dressed it up nice. But that's it.  Food was bland Appetizer sent back as the chase loaf cheese was not melted... Second attempt at appetizer was burnt.. (charred) Didn't bother with a third attempt... Chicken was dry.  Wife had a chicken sandwich... no mayo (asked for extra) We won't be hoping back to this location. Green lane location is always good"}
{"text":"Got stuck and this place was close to the hotel. Now I know that Swiss Chalet isn't fine dining but normally they fill the void like some reliable suburban tradition.  This was just plain bad.  -Wasn't acknowleged upon entering by employees sitting at table facing us. -every aspect of our super easy orders wrong (except the water) -grease on seat we almost sat on -uncleaned spill on the floor for entirety of our visit -tiniest chicken I've ever seen (see photo)  ..but the paise de resistance was when my wife saw a mouse run along the inside of the window.  I should have known... The attached Harvey's served me the worst lunch I've had in 20 years just 2days earlier..  don't eat here.  Note to owners: do yourself a favor, close this place before the city does it for you.  I think this is my first 1 star,.. I've written hundreds of reviews.  Like idiots, we tipped btw. Why?!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say that my experience at Swiss Chalet was not the best.  Not only did we have to wait for 30 minutes to be seated in an already empty restaurant, but we watched groups come in after us and be seated before us.  I even went to the bar to ask for a glass of water while I waited, but was not served there either.  I was almost to the point where I wanted to yell at someone.  Thankfully, I'm patient enough.  Once the five of us were finally seated (and shoved into a four person booth, I might add) the service was extremely slow.  We were not immediately asked for our drink orders, and contemplated ordering our meals along with our food.  Sadly, we didn't.  What should have been an in and out experience took almost more than an hour and a half.  For a company that prides itself on fresh, fast service, we were not satisfied.  After the food was finally brought to the table, I found my meal to be delicious, but very simple.  One piece of bread, some chicken and a bunch of gravy was satisfying enough, but not enough to make me want to go back.  My whole party was very unimpressed with the service and quality of food.  I understand that the restaurant may have been a little under staffed that day, but that's no reason to completely ignore a table... there wasn't so much as a nod in our direction to suggest they would be right with us.  All-in-all, a pretty terrible experience makes me think I probably won't be going back to Swiss Chalet anytime soon... or at least not to this location."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner since we got gift cards.  Food is ok but the portions have gotten smaller.  Our waiter was super nice and even gave us an extra toblerone bar."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday evening and ordered the rib and 5 wings combo. The ribs came out bland and dry, and the fries taste as if they had been deep fried In stale oil. The wings were some of the smallest wings I have ever seen - about the size of a small lemon wedge. My meal was supposed to come with coleslaw, but it wasn't on the plate. The server tried to help by offering extras, but more crappy food wasn't going to fix the problem. Overall, a disappointment and a ripoff. Stay away from this location. There are plenty of other locations with better/more consistent food and service."}
{"text":"This location is very consistent. The food always satisfies and the waiting staff has been there forever, which, to me, is a sign of good management.  Try the hamburger -- it's a secret favourite!"}
{"text":"This particular Swiss Chalet has gone downhill lately, seems like they hired a new cook.  I've ordered from them plenty and normally have no problems with food quality or service. With all casual dining places, I'm more than willing to forgive the odd little hiccup - but my last few experiences are really starting to put me off.  I ordered delivery for my boyfriend and I a few months ago, the order arrived quickly but the driver only gave me one bag when there were two meals in the order. I mentioned this to him and he said I had to pay my bill and then call the restaurant to get it sorted out. I do so, he doesn't take the other meal back. Other meal had included a poutine and there was gravy all over the place. I called the restaurant and the woman I spoke to was very helpful and quickly dispatched a replacement order, which was complete. While both orders were delivered quickly, we were definitely hungry at this point. My boyfriend cuts into his chicken and it is almost raw it's so undercooked. While we could have called the restaurant again to let them know, since this was the first time things have been less than perfect we salvaged the chicken from the other meal and were fine.  About a month after that, we order delivery again. We do get the correct orders in a reasonable amount of time, but my boyfriend's chicken is so dried out it's hard around the edges. He did say it was ok when he got to the middle, but compared to my chicken (which was moist and juicy like we normally get from this location) it was not up to par. I did call in just to report it, didn't want a replacement at that point.  We decided after that to start eating in the restaurant, so we could take care of any quality issues right away.  We went in a few weeks ago and both ordered chicken meals. Again, my boyfriend cut into his and it was extremely dry. Mine was ok, but not as good as I'm used to. The waitress was excellent in taking care of it and replacing it with a better piece of chicken.  I really hope this location gets its act together, they used to be one of my favourite places to eat and now I will only go there if I have no other options."}
{"text":"I'm American. Never heard of this place before but gave it a try. Service was so terrible that I had to write a review from my iPhone. Took three asks to get a soda. Chicken was dry - sahara desert dry. Thank god for ketchup, which covers all sins."}
{"text":"The worst food and service I've ever had from a swiss chalet. Me and my friend have ordered from here a dozen times and every time we get stuff on our order we've requested not to have like bacon (religiously cannot eat bacon) or we order the chicken club kaiser, get charged for it and receive the rotisserie chicken on a kaiser instead upon delivery (which is cheaper than what were paying for). This has happened wayyy too many times and I've officially given up on this location. This past week our work ordered it and I thought I'd give the chicken club wrap another try as it has been 3 weeks since the last time I ordered from there (again trying to give them the benefit of the doubt) but the wrap looked like it had left over scraps from peoples lunch dishes not to mention that I bit into a BONE! There were so many bones!! I didn't want to waste my time calling and complaining either because a few times when a mistake was made on our order we were told to leave the food as is and the delivery person will pick it up and delivery us a new order... so instead of letting us eat the sides in the meantime we had to starve for another 20-30 minutes until they got the order right. Oh yeah! And one time when this happened my friend got charged 2 times on her credit card and it took nearly three weeks for them to refund her the money. I'm sorry but I love swiss chalet so we keep trying to give this location a chance but I finally give up!"}
{"text":"Rob & I have only eaten here once. I believe it was close to Father's Day, so they had a deal on chicken dinners, exclusively for dads. Surprisingly, they gave it to him anyway, depsite the fact that we don't have children. He got his quarter chicken meal, and I got pork ribs, which were chewy and hard to eat. I think they were about 90% fat (shouldn't expect any less from pork, I guess). The best part was dessert: surprisingly, their menu offered a caramel ice cream sundae, so we ordered that & shared it. It was deeeelicious :d Aside from being harder to get to when not driving (we took CT), the reason I gave this 3 stars is because--depsite the fact that the restaurant wasn't overly busy--I got the impression the waitress was hurriedly trying to rush us out of there."}
{"text":"Don't have any of these in the states but growing up in Nfld I've always loved their food!   Simple and completely casual dining with almost a \"home\" feeling. Unlike any other type of franchise because their crowd and waiters are just too kind. Portions are large, place is simple, and meal quality is just superb.   I haven't ever ordered anything besides the chicken and fries with chalet sauce but the flavor is mesmerizing. It's like sitting at home with a plate of chicken.. you just can't stop.  Only have been served by 2 waitresses on the few occasions I have stopped by but they are the best!"}
{"text":"Food took over 45 minutes and it staggered in one dish At a time. The wrap was dry and bland, no dressing for my salad. Service was slow...it was awful"}
{"text":"Absolute brutal delivery. I have had the unfortunate experience of delivery from this restaurant several times, each time hoping for a better or different result. My food is always cold, takes forever for delivery, is missing items or under cooked. If you call to complain, Swiss chalet will say \"we will rush a new order out to you ASAP\" which then takes at least 45-1hr. So really, not asap. On our most recent order we had 2 side orders or fries, both were pretty much RAW. Made the phone call to complain, they said they'd rush new ones out. Almost an hour later the fries arrive...EXACTLY the same. There have to be lots of people that see these items go out before they leave the restaurant, as a manager or a line cook or anyone else who sees this, how do you allow this to leave your restaurant and therefore reflect on you? It's terrible. Given the choice I would choose a different restaurant for delivery or anything, any time. Extremely disappointing."}
{"text":"Swiss Chalet Kick'n Crispy Chicken (Fried Chicken) is here, for a limited time!   Good sized crowd out to try the Crispy Chicken. While the blend of seasonings is nice, the best part of the Crispy Chicken is how juicy it is.  Good portion sizes at this location. The Chicken is marinated for 24 hours."}
{"text":"Never will I ever - eat Swiss Chalet again.  We placed our order at approximately 6:30pm over the phone and were advised it would be ready within 20 minutes. When we arrived at 7pm, we were alarmed to find a woman yelling at the manager for placing her order an hour earlier -- and still not being ready. This should have been our warning. The take out section of the restaurant was packed; naively enough, we stood in line anyway to pay for our order -- $70 worth of Swiss Chalet. The cashier advised it would be a 5 - 10 minute wait...  And so, the waiting commenced. After 25 minutes, the woman who had been previously yelling at the manager, left equipped with her order.  40 minutes go by...we still haven't received our order. I wait in line again to inquire about the status of our order; the cashier states she'll go check...when she returns, she's accompanied by the Harvey's manager. (As this location is shared between the two.) She advises that there's FORTY ORDERS ahead of ours...what? We'd been there already 40 minutes, had put in our order well over an hour ago...and there was HOW MANY ORDERS BEFORE OURS? For a take out restaurant? A fast food option? She then further adds insult to injury by saying: 'there's nothing I can do.' Annoyed, I walked away to reconvene with my boyfriend who had made idle small chat with some other people near by: some had already been waiting 20 minutes themselves and were mortified that we'd been there for almost an hour. We wait an additional 20 minutes before my boyfriend decides enough is enough, he wants a refund.  My boyfriend has the patience of a saint, and knows yelling solves nothing. He casually empathizes with the cashier about how hectic the store is at the moment and that it must be another one of those long nights. He understands stores can get busy. He tell's the cashier it's getting late and he's growing more and more hungry so the fact that there is still 40 orders ahead of his just simply isn't going to be the solution for the family this evening. The cashier calls over the Harvey's manager again so she can authorize the refund. My boyfriend welcomes the manager, introduces himself and kindly repeats his empathy for the stores traffic. The manager is now much calmer since my boyfriend isn't tearing her a new one, but he is asking why Swiss Chalet has set such terrible customer expectations... \"the phone rep told us it was going to be ready for 6:50pm, we're here at 7, we're told it'll take another in 5 - 10 minutes, now over an hour after it was supposed to be ready you're telling me there's 40 orders AHEAD of us?! This how now turned into a terrible experience for both me and you\".   The managers seemed taken abackk, and so were the surrounding customers... He had a bit of an audience going at this point courtesy of his diplomacy. The manager nods and says \"yes, sir, I understand customer service and what setting customer expectations is all about, this is fast food, people shouldn't be waiting more than 20 minutes\". My boyfriend replies, \"I'm not sure you do understand, because if Swiss Chalet would have told me it was going to take an hour in the first place maybe I would have shown up at the right time and I wouldn't be here asking for a refund now. The least you could have done was be transparent with me when I came into the store with the situation and offered me an alternative solution, if possible.\" The manager is now trying to defer the attention by stating that she's specifically the Harvey's manager and that the Swiss Chalet representative works exclusively on the dining room side of the business. WTF?  So the conversation has now seemed to have hit a dead end and it's time to issue the refund. The manager hands my boyfriend cash, and he breaks into a fit of laughter (combination of tired, hunger, and this place is a joke). \"but ma'am, I paid with my Credit Card, and that's about $30 short!\" The manager now decides to explain that this is the only way she can issue the refund. My boyfriend is still laughing \"did we not just connect over setting customer expectations?! When were you going to tell me that you couldn't refund me with the method that I paid.\" The other customers who were waiting with us are now are all in line waiting for their refund. The manager apologizes, gives him the full amount in cash and inquires \"is there anything I can do to make this experience better so that you may return in the future\". My boyfriend \"do you have any food?\". She doesn't even bother responding at that point, reaches for a business card writes her name on it and proceeds \"I'm a little busy right now, but if you call me tomorrow I can issue you a credit for your next visit, just please don't call head office\".  At that point, we folded up the receipt (which she wasn't going to give to us)  even after we stated: \"but you processed my credit card!\" and made our way for the exit - leaving behind six other furious people looking for refunds, too."}
{"text":"Great food and great value? Not really! What happened to their chicken now?  I ordered two leg dinner.  They've gone smaller.  Fries were oily, soft like they've been sitting there for hours.  My order came in raw inside.  How can they not cook small chicken properly?  I told the waitress and she said she can have them cooked more.  My husband's order were perfect and not red inside.  She took my plate and re-grilled both chickens legs.  I got them back tasting like the greasy grill and dry. I didn't eat them and said just pack them.  No one wants to eat them at home so they went in my green bin.    They look so good in the picture.  Plump big and juicy...beautiful fries. But in reality, a total disappointment. After all, I didn't get good value for my money.    When I receive Swiss Chalet coupons in my mail, they go straight in the garbage."}
{"text":"I can only say Swiss Chalet at its finest.  My son and I arrived for lunch a little early, just before 12 noon, and I think we hit Gold..... we both  like Swiss Chalet, always did, and I've had lots of different kinds of food and service there. But at this new location in Airdrie - it was perfect!! Chicken was just prepared, fries were to die for delicious - and to think I almost got a salad. Our server was there at every point to see how we were doing with our meal and if we needed anything else.  Full brownie points for Swiss Chalet at this location. We will be back there lots."}
{"text":"I must echo Tiffany's review: this \"express\" Swiss Chalet location was filthy. The floors were especially disgusting and none of the tables were cleared. I mistook a customer for an employee rigorously wiping down a table and chairs before sitting down. I should have done the same.  On top of the grime uncharacteristic of a Swiss Chalet, the menu board did not have all of the typical items - it was a pared down menu with only the basics. Not sure if it's because it was a 'no frills' location or because they don't have a full kitchen facility. There is no table service - you order at the counter and take it away yourself. That is, provided you're able to secure some space at the counter in the first place and elbow one of the drivers milling about out of the way. There needs to be a better division for customers ordering vs. employees picking up orders for delivery. This was a terrible Swiss Chalet impression, and I expected more from The Beaches as there isn't another one for miles.  Also, did you know that a plate of Swiss Chalet fries (mmm) contains 544 calories? Yeah."}
{"text":"This is the best of the Swiss Chalet locations and it's because the servers really care. There are a handful of longtime servers that will recognize you from visit to visit and remember what you usually order. You can't really say that about most large, chain restaurants, can you? Anthony and Nicholas have perfected the art of customer service and it's a real treat to be served by them.   Swiss Chalet is a fairly typical experience from location to location, but this busy restaurant in the theatre district regularly exceeds expectations. Expect a long wait at lunch - if I'm dining with a group we usually adjust our visit to an off-peak time because the wait times can be long!"}
{"text":"Love this location.  The service level is very good.  They are quick and nice.  They are also organized.  There is always deals, suggestion is sign up for email deals.  No printing required, just have it ready on your phone.  The quality is consistent with the Swiss Chalet standards.  This locations is an Express location which has a nice dining space.    Refill on sodas available.  You can also order in advance and pick up or get it delivered.  Another good Swiss Chalet experience."}
{"text":"Was here about two weeks ago on a weekday evening, so it was slow. Normally the quality is standard but on this visit, the pasta dish tasted terrible and the chicken spring rolls were cold and came late. We ordered the kids dishes when we first sat down in order to get them fed sooner, but they forgot to put the order in and instead the kids food arrived when ours did.  They forgot my wife's water and needed two reminders.  Normally a bit more on the ball during lunch, I'll stick to take out in the evenings."}
{"text":"quick service at this location, but rather small portions.. especially the fries.  I have received bigger portion of fries from different swiss chalets..  as with many swiss chalets this location is full of old folks.."}
{"text":"Average Swiss Chalet, building is old just take a look around and you'll definitely notice it.   Overall food was average, server was kind of quirky which made the experience a little more enjoyable. I got a Rickards Red but the beer had gone flat or something so it wasn't very good.   Got the two can dine deal, as well as a spinach dip. Overall not bad experience nothing to really complain about."}
{"text":"Went for a last dinner with the family before heading back to NH in the morning. Usually make at least one pilgrimage to a Swiss Chalet when we are back home and have been to this location before, PY (Pre-Yelp). Not a stellar experience, this time, sadly.  It was great that the place wasn't too busy. We easily found seating for 8 people. Problems started when the waitress brought drinks. She took two of four big glasses off her tray, then reached across her body to pull out straws. People at far end of the table said they saw the tray lean forward ; a glass of water and one of Pepsi took a dive, as if in slo-mo. Most of the liquids hit the table, floor and seating, but my mother-in-law and I got splattered. The young lady apologized profusely. We were left to find new seating on our own. Again, good thing place wasn't too busy and there were options.   A team of at least four crew members came with cleaning materials. Another server came to our new location, offered an apology. But we had to ask more than once for cutlery and napkins for everyone. No sign of a manager. Ok, we didn't make a fuss. Ordered our meals.   Everyone who had the standard quarter chicken dinners were happy. Burgers were said to be good. One person had a stir fry and was quite pleased. Another had her favorite Tuscan linguine. I opted for spinach and chicken salad. Passable. The chicken breast on top was very dried out. God knows how long it had been sitting under a heat lamp before they found a use for it. They forgot the tortilla strips. Dressing was vaguely similar to the chalet dipping sauce. Our server brought one person a soft drink refill without being asked, but didn't bother with my niece, whose glass was also empty.   When the bill finally came, we had hoped that at least a couple meals would have been comped for the earlier incident. Apparently not. My M-I-L will probably have to get her lamb shearling coat professionally cleaned, as some Pepsi dribbled on it. At least my clothes and coat can be washed, so no cost to me. It was just uncomfortable sitting on a damp pant leg.   Our brother-in-law is going to contact the restaurant, talk to a manager and file a complaint. We felt there should have been some sort of recompense, and it's very disappointing that a manager never came forward at the time, assuming one was in the building. Onus shouldn't be on the customer (we understand, accidents happen) or on the staff who don't have full authority to make such decisions. Perhaps we shall stick with takeout next time"}
{"text":"This is a great Swiss Chalet location and delivers the quality expected of this chain restaurant.  This a fairly new location and follows the current style model, it is clean, efficient service and a good value for the quality of food available."}
{"text":"Tried and tested menu and met the expectations of a chain restaurant. SC is known for their rotisserie chicken and it rarely disappoints. The lighting is way too bright at this location so be prepared for the lack of ambiance."}
{"text":"Not one of the better Swiss Chalet locations available.  This location is old and shows it, it was not the most clean and the servers seemed disinterested in being there.  The menu is the same as every other location but it sure was not the same stanards I would get at other other locations I have been to.  With 3 other locations within a 5 minute drive i would recommend the drive."}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend and we each had rotisserie chicken and fries. The fries were absolutely perfect! The only problem is that it's an out-dated restaurant, so booths feel like they're super close together. It felt like we were eating in a cafeteria! The quality food made up for the sub-par atmosphere. Our server was kind and friendly."}
{"text":"I have been to this location a number of times and the service is always awful. There is nobody to greet you at the door and it can take several minutes before you are noticed. The service is always slow so I've learned to order the specials. Today though was worse than ever. I ordered an appetizer and two specials. Half an hour later I didn't have our appetizer. It shouldn't take that long to get food at all - we should have already finished our appetizer and have received our specials by that time. We flagged down the waitress and she said she would check on it. She came back and told us it would be ten more minutes before the appetizer was ready. Forty minutes from order to food? Sounds to me like the order wasn't put in at all. Normally if I have issues I talk to a manager to get things straightened out. Today that was not an option. You didn't get the order wrong. You didn't forget something on my order. You forgot the whole order. I had got up and left. I will not be going back. If you really want Swiss Chalet find another location."}
{"text":"I ordered roast beef with ribs .. the roast beef has an after taste and the ribs were cold .. the french fries were really good thats why i gave 1 star .. otherwise i would v given ZERO stars .. the table beside us commplained coz they got there order served cold, never ever goin back again .. thanks for nothin !!!"}
{"text":"Dip & Win is on now!  Kinda like Roll up the Rim to win.    Order the sauce with their famous chicken, YUM!!  I had the double-leg dinner with a multigrain roll and their creamy coleslaw.  Very generous helping of the coleslaw on a romaine lettuce leaf.  Chicken and sauce go hand in hand.    Service is always good here."}
{"text":"I like this Swiss Chalet!  It's big, clean and they have a mixture of booths and tables and chairs.  The booths are more comfortable than the older Swiss Chalet restaurants like the one in Crowfoot.    The service was pretty good.  The food was delivered quickly and tastes good.    I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Ever since my delivery started coming from this location I've gotten cold food, burnt ribs, chicken with skin torn off, cheesecake with too little sauce and just overall disappointing dinners. I kept passing it off until tonight.  After an hour our food finally came, they forgot the Chalet sauce. So I call customer service immediately and ask them for the sauce and to replace my fries as those go cold the fastest.   They took an entire hour to come back (I live 5 mins away!) and another follow up phone call. The representative literally told me she had no way of contacting the driver as it had already been sent out.   When the driver came, he just shrugged like we didn't just wait 2 hours to eat cold food we paid $100 for.   And their $6 slice of cake was tiny with . Never ever ordering from this place again."}
{"text":"Ordered for myself and my son through skip the dishes. I got a ribs meal and my son got pizza. The ribs were gross.. I don't even know how to describe it.. mushy would probably be the best word . I also found what looks like an eye lash in my potatoes (photo below). I will not be ordering from here again. I used to love Swiss Chalet food but this has completely turned me away from anything they have on their menu"}
{"text":"Don't bother with this dump. Food is cold, takes forever to get to the table, wait staff can't be bothered to do anything, and management couldn't care less when its brought to their attention. Then you're contacted by someone in 'management', who does nothing but offer petty lip service, no resolution or apology, then doesn't return message when they find out you paid cash, i.e no electronic record, so no interest in following up."}
{"text":"Roast beef was dry and overcooked.  The wifi was blocked behind a password (SSID: Swiss Chalet Guess), but no one seemed to know the password.   Only gave two stars because the staff was super friendly.  Corporate needs to make sure this location is better run."}
{"text":"I just picked up a family pack for dinner and when I opened the food at home, the chicken was obviously overcooked. The wings were completely black and inedible, the dark meat was hard on the outside. I was close to making the trek back to return the meal but the family was hungry and didn't want to wait.  Now anyone looking at the chicken could tell it was way overdone and someone had to cut it up and packed it in the container. If their staff is so uncaring about quality, what does that say about the restaurant?"}
{"text":"Had to pick up an item on behalf of a friend.  What stood out was the service that came from the women behind the counter.  I had asked for a \"hot chicken sandwich with peas and gravy\", which wasn't on their take-out menu.  Anyway, she really knew her menu - something that I've noticed ppl in other fields don't necessarily.    Would everyone working there fit this one person's people skill level? Probably not, but it'd be great to run into this kind of competency again.  A 4 for the person who helped me figure out the best meal choice today, a 3 would be for any other person who works there.  ~~~other feedback: Food was good, and came with everything needed - sour cream apparently had chives already *inside*.    Prices for take-out tended to be about $1+ cheaper than eat-in.  My friend ended up having the hot chicken on a kaiser, with a baked potato, and seemed at least satisfied with the meal."}
{"text":"Ordered ONLINE delivery service for my husband late this afternoon.  Food arrived in very good timing; both myself and my husband were impressed with how quickly the order came.  Two chicken legs were the main course.  Once he started to have the chicken, he got up to actually compost the chicken.  He,  an omnivore, typically never does this with meat-based dishes. He couldn't, however, continue eating it - the taste of the chicken had been compromised, the cut wasn't a good one.  There went our dinner meals.    Myself, I had just a side baked potato.  Plus some other homemade options, so I wasn't relying on the same chicken/meal.  We had high hopes for tonight's meal.  High but realistic.  I ended up calling SC's take-out/delivery number and spoke to someone in customer service.  Two choices were offered - to get the very same exact order again, although we'd have to get back into the compost bin to dig out all the chicken bits to give in exchange.  Or to receive a $10 credit.  My husband will never want the same chicken leg order again, so we opted for the $10.  Yes, we'd recommend other options from SC, but absolutely definitely not their chicken legs."}
{"text":"Pink chicken anyone?   Ordered a quarter chicken dinner; my chicken was pink. I was so turned off, I couldn't eat it.  I just wanted a refund. The manager was away , so  I left my number for him to call me.  The Owner called a few hours later and argued that young chickens are pink, it's normal to have a pink chicken. Owner was rude, aggressive and disrespectful.   2 days later, the Owner called me at 9:25am on a Sunday morning to argue with me about the pink chicken. I asked why he called me so early on a Sunday morning, he said it was within Business hours.  The restaurant doesn't open until 11am.     I felt harassed and will never eat at this location again.   Overall, two thumbs down."}
{"text":"Rarely ever get to go to this place but there food is great! I love eating there and I recommend to get chicken every single time you go there. The place is a bit rundown however, and the furniture is a bit worn out. The price is also a pretty big stretch as well. But it would be great for smaller families and outings with friends! This place is a solid four stars."}
{"text":"Went here with my husband and his brother on a Sunday afternoon Feb 12th. There were barely any people there, yet it took a while to get our food and get served. My husband and his brother used to work at a Swiss Chalet when they were in high school so they were very surprised it was taking so long. My husband ordered wings. The server spilled the extra BBQ sauce on my husband and some went on the wall. She thought it was funny but my husband was pissed. Later we heard her giggling in the back about it with the other staff. Very unprofessional.   I got a quarter chicken dinner with fries and the coconut pie was very good.  Pierogies to start which burned my mouth and tongue.   Overall, slow service at a non-busy hour. Server was not very good, but good food.   They contacted me about this experience and said they would message me about it, then never followed up."}
{"text":"Service isn't really good, but isn't the worse I've seen in my eating days. The only thing keeping me there is the food."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly. That's the only reason I'm giving two stars. The new location is terrible, and I'm always missing something from my order. Notice as soon as I get home"}
{"text":"Got the quarter leg dinner with corn and steamed veg. The chicken was tiny and the veg/corn were quite bland. The chicken was quite salty and luckily I got dark meat because I can't imagine how dry the white meat will be... Service was quite disappointing but understandable as there was only 1 server on the whole floor ... even if it's not busy, you need more than 1 server"}
{"text":"My favourite location for my favourite restaurant. I definitely recommend this location to a lot of people."}
{"text":"So disorganized and very slow for an \"express\" location! Not only did our order get lost in the middle of a few orders (wasn't even that busy for lunch), there were other customers complaining about wrong orders. Ended up in the express area for over half hour.  Might as well have just dined in..."}
{"text":"Consistent with all the other Swiss chalets in terms of food quality. We ordered take out and some items were missing from our order. We called and spoke with a manager and she basically just asked for my boyfriends name then hung up. We weren't sure how much was credited and not that impressed. However the next time we ordered again the girl on the line was extremely helpful and we had no issues finding or using the credit."}
{"text":"The service wasn't the best, our server wasn't very kind. The food tasted off, the special sauce that came with my burger tasted like a herby cinnamon gravy. My bun was cold and the fries tasted old."}
{"text":"My Friend loves Swiss Chalet, and always wants me to go with him. I finally did. (I've previously been to a Swiss Chalet on Vancouver Island.)  My Chicken came (I got the 2 pieces of dark meat and mashed potatoes) And it was really slimy and gross. This wasn't the terrible part -- what is with those mashed potatoes? They tasted like they were instant mashed -- and I'm pretty sure they were. They also gave me a huge portion of gravy for the tiny portion of mashed potatoes -- what a waste. Redeeming quality of the meal -- the coleslaw wasn't bad.   The one on Vancouver Island has way more class than this one , I'm not sure if it's because this one is downtown Toronto? Needless to say, there is no excuse."}
{"text":"Called the 1866 # for delivery couldn't even hear the guy let alone understand him. I was told told I couldn't have a loaded baked potato and fries with my half chicken dinner I couldn't help but laugh and hang up. Called again talk to someone else, then I was told that they couldn't deliver to us that we aren't near a Swiss chalet I can literary stand on the deck and see them. What a mission to get food so I drove down there just to be disappointed with dry bland no good food!"}
{"text":"I don't like the processed chemically taste that is Swiss Chalet, but we came here for an extended family meal, and other members of the family like to eat here.  The restaurant is very busy, which always amazes me. Fortunately the gravy comes in a separate dish, which means that if you mistaking try it, you haven't ruined your entire meal by smothering it in the horrible after-taste.  After a poor experience in a Swiss Chalet in Windsor I was reluctant to come, but did so for my family. The experience at this one has done nothing to change my opinion of Swiss Chalet. Hopefully I won't have to endure it again."}
{"text":"The worst restaurant I have ever been to. Expensive for the crappy food burnt fries. The fish was not fresh - powedry. Will never go back!"}
{"text":"So before I begin I must say this is Swiss Chalet. The food is always consistent, in this case it means good. The decor is as always dated and not very appealing.   On this visit the food is exactly what we expected but the service was great.  The server was attentive and accommodating. This is the type of service that would make me come back again and again. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Ok, I seriously I would never have come here had I not had both kids in soccer that day, plus a birthday party to attend later and a killer migraine earlier in the day.    Seeing how Swiss Chalet just opened up in my neck of the woods I figured, hey, what have I got to loose?  It is just chicken.  Correction, salty, greasy, just ok chicken that I could have easily purchased from a nearby Safeway or Superstore for about $7.00 for the entire bird.    It happened to be moderately busy in there but not at half full capacity by any means.  We got an overly exuberant waitress, who was nice and all, I prefer the more mellow laid-back type of  waiters but to each his own.  We placed our order, as well as the kids meals (BTW the kids menu is this mish mash of combinations like pizza and fries, or chicken and fruit, strange, but nothing I would serve to my kids but let it slide since they were hungry)  We both ordered the quarter chicken dinners, I had corn and hubby had mashed potatoes.  We started with a Ceaser salad that was fresh and good.  Fries were over done and blah, mashed potatoes were not creamy, and had a bitter aftertaste which I found odd, I think they could have been instant potatoes.  Corn tasted like something you would feed cattle; tough, not seasoned, and really corny in that it wasn't sweet like some Green Giant Niblets but some bulk generic grade C product. Chicken was alright, but nothing worth $10, actually, you could get a better meal at Christy's.  The waitress did forget our butter for the buns and their pride and joy, the dipping sauce.  She brought the sauce in one hand and a hand full of of butter packages in the other and plopped them on the table, how classy!  I guess they were out of plates as well as small teaspoons that I requested for my little guys ice cream.  After we finished our meal, our overly-excited waitress was on her dinner break, bitching to another staff member about her crappy job.  So it took her a while to ring us up but whatever, I'm not coming to this place anytime soon so I didn't loose my head.  If you are looking for a good quick roast chicken fix, try Christy's ( Review to follow) a bit cheaper, better sides and chicken has a better flavour. Or better yet, get a bird from Sobeys or Superstore which are near by for a better bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Honestly so unhealthy and \"cheap\". The fries are deep fried twice, to get their soft interior yet crunchy crisp exterior. The sides; mashed potatoes, rice, veggies are literally microwaved and thrown on your plate.   The chicken. Sooooo salty. And the skin? Literally just full of fat. And don't forget about the watered down sauce.   Pair this with crappy service. Who wants to eat here?"}
{"text":"This was my worst restaurant experience ever. Ordered the crispy chicken and what I got were two over fried inedible bricks and some stale fries. I showed our server who went to speak to the manager and all they offered was 5$ off and the manager didn't even come to apologize or try to make things right. Don't waste your time or money here."}
{"text":"I am a true Swiss Miss. My friends Gray B and Matt M and I enjoy calling Swiss Chalet \"Ethnic Food,\"  and we order it to my door on the regular. Couch for one? Right this way, Miss W...   After an hour of the \"where are we going to eat?!\" dance and a few giggles with another fan of the bird n' sauce, we decided to walk through Dufferin Grove park (beautiful, gotta review it soon!) to the Sufferin' Mall and follow our noses to the sweet, sweet scent of rotisserie .  We started with the pierogies, which are only OK and cheap and hard but cheddar filled and tasty enough. We then moved on to the classic quarter chicken dinner with fries and extra Chalet sauce.    In Chalet Sauce Canada trusts. You know the drill, friends.   PEPPER'S PISSED about this location because the Dufferin Mall is just so horrifying."}
{"text":"Putting a Swiss Chalet under a maternity wing, where super pregnant people are forced to go every two weeks, should be criminal. Unfortunately, Toronto doesn't operate under prenatal law, thus I down *the* sauce on the regular from this location.   Their take out section runs like a well oiled machine. I guess that's what happens when you grease the wheels with chalet sauce."}
{"text":"5/5 for our server Mark! Meals were consistent with what you expect from Swiss Chalet... No surprises there... MENS BATHROOM WAS HORRENDOUS! Ownership needs to look into this ASAP! Definitely not an exaggeration to say that this was the worst-smelling washroom I have encountered in my lifetime! All in all great experience with Mark, not-so-great experience with the restaurant itself."}
{"text":"How much I miss the Swiss Chalet sauce and Chicken in California.   Weird though is sounds this is the first place we go to when we are in Canada.  There is some cult thing about the fries dipped in the sauce and the melt in your mouth chicken.    Nothing beats Swiss Chalet.   I think they need to expand to the USA."}
{"text":"We are grew up on Swiss chalet growing up.  The taste of the sauce the bread and ohh the chicken.   Unfortunately Ontario is different than Alberta.  Alberta Swiss chalet fries are not As good.  Felt like they were fried in fish oil as the fries had a smell."}
{"text":"We waited for 20 mins before we got service. And then the orders were all mixed up. Call me fussy, but the cauliflower had a rather peculiar green spots on it. I passed on the veggies.   I love Swiss Chalet, but this location didn't inspire any confidence."}
{"text":"What just happened?  You really need to make me feel unwelcome and horrible to receive a  1 Star from me.  It just happened today. After wanting to try Nando's and not wanting to wait forever for a seat, we decided to go to Swiss Chalet. Sat with one of the servers we have seen for years...I do mean years.  She was there for almost a decade and we've been coming here for almost 17 years (including when the old location was on Weldrick and Yonge.) One not so advertised specials is a CAA deal. Two quarter chicken dinners for $15.99 - a saving of $3.49.  It's not much but why not take the discount if you're ordering it anyways - right? We have a new account from CAA.  For now, we have a temporary card + an account number in the event we need their service.  We ordered the deal and a couple of other meals. Before we even got our drinks, the manager came by demanding a card or the account number.  He did not even introduce himself and was aggressive.  We were told that the deal can not be processed without proper information.  Not a problem, however, he was loud, rude, and implied that we were trying to pull a fast one to save $3.49 by using a temporary and invalid card.  We were lectured and embarassed in front of other patrons and uneasy staff.  I, basically, said to forget it.  I was less than impressed. Nonetheless, we were forced to save face.  We called CAA to get the full account number, and requested that he try again.  This time, no problems - however, no apologies for his strong tactics. The family night was ruined.  In the world where family time continues to shrink, and as kids grow up, nights together become challenging, no one should have the right to ruin it.  There was no need for him to show up and push his attitude around.  Normally, these things are handled by the server and there was no need for his interference. I paid the bill, and totally tipped the server her fair share, why penalize her and the staff for his attitude. On the way out, I requested to speak to him.  In no uncertain terms, I made him understand that customers are key to a business.  Especially someone who has provided patronage for 17 years.  For a Saturday night, prime time dinner hour, this place was not even close to full.  What do you think happened?  We really should have waited the 20+ minutes at Nando's - a busy night speaks volume about how customers like a place."}
{"text":"I've been going to/ordering from this location since I was a kid but it is getting worse all the time. Tonight the driver mixed up our orders, we called as soon as we realized the mistake. The driver returned to take the other person order and gave us a bag that had been torn open and told me that the other customer was angry with ME, and it was my fault(?!) The Swiss Chalet helpline told us they would send a new unopened replacement. Long sorry short (4 phone calls, assured multiple times that the order would arrive monetarily) I finally got through to the local store. They told me the driver said he dropped off the replacement already... (WHAT?) and that I could not have a refund but if I insisted I could come get it myself. SO GLAD we tipped... So insane. Totally absurd 2-hour ordeal. Eat anywhere else."}
{"text":"Lemon merengue pie was grainy, soggy and half frozen.  This is the second time we've experienced issues with the desserts here. Last month we ordered the apple pie and had to send it back as there was a big chunk of hard gelatine in it. Manager was great with us as even though we didn't make a big deal about it, she gave us 2 free dinners for next time which we are here for tonight.  Chicken a hit, dessert a big miss for freshness."}
{"text":"This is a hybrid swiss chalet Harvey's which means you can get chicken with awesome onion rings. Oh yeah!  I've never eaten in, I ve always taken out or did the drive thru. Oh I forgot to mention the drive thru. Don't go if there's already someone there. You can get stuck behind someone who is ordering something from the chalet Swiss that takes a while to cook. Just go in, they have a bench for you to sit on.  There's a large -ish parking lot surrounding the building. It can be busy because there's a Starbucks and some banks. But don't fear, its part if a giant smart centre type place so tonnes of parking. I think there's a bus on Major Mackenzie but I feel its probably best to drive  Why I like this location you may ask? Why it's because they have never messed up my order. I have always gotten everything I have paid for and its been warm, fresh made, and tasty. I've been to others that were pretty lax on their Swiss chalet standards. Not these guys. Nice!  Maybe I'll sit next to you on the takeout bench one day!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location forever because it's close to home and somewhere we can go as a family that everyone can agree on.   The service is always fast and friendly and the food is good. I usually get the same 2 things- either the quarter chicken white or the club wrap with either a salad with house dressing or mashed potatoes. They're also good with substituting because I always order my wrap without cheese or tomato. Also shout out to their chicken soup it is freaking amazing!!   If you're looking for something fast, yummy, relatively cheap and a good portion size, you can never go wrong with some chalet swiss!!"}
{"text":"I only had about a 30 minute lunch break but thought to grab takeout from this Harvey's & Swiss Chalet location as I had a gift card. The line only had one person in front of me. I ordered a quarter chicken dinner with coleslaw and they had it ready in about 6 minutes.  My only issue is that Swiss Chalet accepts the Scene card and the cashier didn't ask me if I had one. I mentioned it to the cashier while ordering and he said I could get my points after the transaction. The transaction went through and I asked about my Scene points and he said he couldn't give it to me anymore. Um, excuse me, what? I mentioned that it was HIM who said he could still give me the points. I think he then talked to his supervisor and they were able to give me my points, yayy."}
{"text":"I'm Canadian, which means before moving to the US, I ate in many many Swiss Chalets. On a recent trip to Calgary, I was looking forward to my first Swiss Chalet meal in a long time. This location was the closest to my hotel, so off I went.   Service was terrible - the worst I've ever had at a Swiss Chalet. The waitress approaches and the first thing she says, even before taking my order, is a loud, rude comment about my physical appearance. Of course the family in the booth beside me literally turn at once and look at me to see what they can see.   My first thought is to get up and walk out, but my Swiss Chalet craving overtakes my anger. The waitress then proceeds to provide NO service. The food comes fast so one star for that. But her method of checking in on me while I'm eating is to quickly walk by my table while saying 'everything good?' without slowing down, stopping or waiting for a response.   At this point I've had enough. Another waitress is sitting at the table behind me, folding napkins onto cutlery. I turn around and ask her to call the manager over. She walks off, and returns a few minutes later saying the manager is busy and I'll have to wait. I wait....5 minutes....10 minutes.   Suddenly someone approaches my table. It's my waitress. She asks why I want to speak to the manager and what the problem is. Apparently cutlery girl gave her the heads up! So I tell her what she said was rude and made me uncomfortable, and that the rest of her service was lacking too. She apologizes and asks how the food was, clearly missing the point about the rude comment. Cutlery girl then appears beside her to join the action, so I once again ask for the manager. Cutlery girl again tells me the manager is busy but I can go talk to her in the takeout section.  Over to the takeout section I go. There are five other people waiting there, presumably for their meals. I stand at the takeout counter for about three minutes before I am acknowledged. It's the manager. At this point, I'm fuming. I introduce myself as the customer who wanted to talk to her 10 minutes ago. She makes a nonsensical excuse about having to wait for her husband and tells me to go ahead - in front of the crowd of customers standing all around me. I point out this may not be the best place so she motions for me to join her at the kitchen doorway.   There I relay my experience, explaining how unacceptable the comment was, and how bad the service, including having to wait 10 minutes to speak to her. More apologies and a promise to talk to the waitress later.   I leave with a bad taste in my mouth that even Chalet sauce cant disguise."}
{"text":"Came here at around 1PM, was hoping to avoid the lunch time rush. I avoided it alright, but service was terribly slow, took forever to place my order, took forever for me to receive my food, and took forever for me to get my bill and of course took forever for the waitress to bring the machine around for me to pay my bill.   I don't get why the service was so slow though, it wasn't busy, there were only a few tables.  Aside from that, the food was pretty good, I ordered the double leg with fries, the plate was filled with fries, the sauce as always is very good and never enough, but if i ordered extra sauce, there would be too much sauce, maybe if their sauce bowls increased by 25% that would be a perfect fit!"}
{"text":"So my wife loves Swiss Chalet's rotisserie chicken and overall this restaurant has done that fairly well. The fries are often cold and dry but we order delivery through the app so that is almost understandable.   Where my understanding stops however is right there. I'm a hot chicken kinda guy and almost every time they screw something up. I've had dark meat when I paid for white, I've had bread that was so hard and stale it felt like I came out of a toaster, I've had a bones in the chicken sandwich, I've gotten my order without gravy and a few other significant screw ups on a simple order.   I have complained to corporate and they always refer it to the store where I get the usual apology and we'll offer you a complimentary meal next time you come in. Which we never have or intend to.   Today though I thought I outsmarted them. I ordered a chicken pot pie. I know this shit is pre-cooked and frozen so they can't screw it up right?   WRONG.  This was delivered just like this photo shows and it smells like vomit. It must have soured or something because I couldn't stand the smell much longer than it took to take the picture.   There's another Swiss Chalet closer to my house that is serviced by UberEats and I may give them a chance but I'm officially done with this one. If I could give zero stars I would."}
{"text":"For a Swiss, this one is good... you're basically getting sit down fast food but I really enjoy it here... been a few times and only had good experiences.  Chicken  always fresh(as expected) and service always good..."}
{"text":"Leo and I don't go out to eat together alot.  Since I can't put 0 star 1 is what it gets. I was looking forward to this eating out with leo. It was an awful experience for both of us let me count the ways: 1.) It took them a long time to sit us. 2.) When we got sitter it took a long time again to get our order. 3.) When leo ordered for beer he wasn't given the choices. 4.) The food that we ordered was the rotisserie beef...it wasn't that wonderful. 5.) The server was so much in a hurry that the service was so lousy. 6.) When we were done eating, we were waiting forever. I asked the serve to bring our bill...and she said yah yah yah...and she served other customers, went to the kitchen...and did forgot all about our bill... 7.) Lastly...DIRTY..DIRTY...DIRTY 8.) There were only 4 servers for the whole restaurant which is 1 server for 3 rows long of tables  Our date night was a disaster...we were in and out of there so fast."}
{"text":"Food is good but service usually slow and crappy.   The decor in this location is odd. All these random old knick knacks and framed decorative moldings. Not sure what Swiss Chalet is trying to become but it was fine before.  My nephew got a Shirley Temple. They are usually small (at least when I was a kid they were) but his was huge. Nice to not have to get refills.  Desserts are surprisingly good and you can get seated quickly. If only service was quicker and better.  The new crispy chicken is good but only for a limited time. Worth popping in to try.  They served us in weird phases, first the entree, then the sides that went with it, then Chalet sauce, then condiments - each time going back to the kitchen and taking 5 minutes to come back.  Granted we were a group of 8 but it still seems like there was a better way to serve the good.  We had to go looking for the waitress to get the bill. She was taking too long and we had to get going."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner tonight. We got excellent service from Katarina. She was very attentive, polite, smiling, and took care of the kids very well. The food came out hot and was served within a reasonable time. We had a good experience."}
{"text":"I ordered the half chicken dinner, my daughter the 2 mini beef burgers and the wife chicken ceaser salad.  My chicken was over cooked and hard not juicy. My daughters burgers were good and the wife's salad was delicious"}
{"text":"I wanted to try Swiss chalet as it has been a while, so I opted for the same half chicken dinner with gravy on the side. The waitress was excellent, how ever the cook was a disaster, fries were under cooked and cold, will not be returning... Remember when Swiss chalet was good."}
{"text":"I don't think you can have a more quintessential Canadian dinner than having a quarter chicken with fries. This is particular location is near and dear to my heart as I've been coming here for years with my family. Unlike some other locations service and food quality is consistently good. The staff here are always cheerful and friendly and most have been working here for years!  My obvious selection for dinner tonight  Quarter Chicken Dinner (white meat) w/ fresh cut fries, chalet sauce, & a dinner roll. Chicken here is always cooked perfectly with that crispy skin, those fresh cut fries come out piping hot & golden brown piled high and that chalet sauce I could just drink it by the steaming cup full!  The food here is soo simple yet comforting, even those plain white mashed potatoes with the dark gravy or a baked potato with sour cream, I can't help but feel at home when I'm eating here.  Plus they bring you that warm lemony water in a bowl to wash your fingers in so your prepped and ready to tackle to that dessert menu.  And don't you dare forget about dessert! Whether it be an old fashioned Sundae topped with whipped cream and a maraschino cherry, Slice of that creamy Coconut Cream Pie or the Double layer Carrot Cake with rich cream cheese icing you won't be disappointed.  What really drove us to Swiss Chalet this particular night was to try there Winter Feature dessert  Red Velvet Cake w/ raspberry and chocolate filling topped with cream cheese icing I really hope they keep this as a standard on there dessert menu because it was sooo gooooddd! The cake was soo moist and the slight tartness of the raspberry filling and the surprising fudgey chocolate layer made for an out of this world delicious take on red velvet cake!  Swiss Chalet you do no wrong in my books and thanks for keeping things lively with your seasonal offerings however your standard fare keeps me and many always coming back!"}
{"text":"This is your standard Swiss Chalet.  It is pretty big and bright inside.  I thought I would break from the norm of getting chicken and try the ribs.  I was disappointed.  The ribs were chewy and the baked potato was over cooked and very dry.  The service was slow as well and there weren't that many people there, so I'm not sure why the food took so long."}
