{"text":"Once voted as Montreal's best pizza, Coronet still is one of the top 5 in the city. The sauce has a certain sweetness to it. I love that they still do it the old fashioned way - one pizza at a time (not sure if they toss them in the air...hmmm). The edges are all fat and uneven and they put rolled dough in the center when they deliver."}
{"text":"I really like the pizza here. The dough is nice and fluffy, and they're very generous on the cheese. My go-to pizza place in Ville Saint-Laurent. It is a bit pricier than the average pizza joint, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"So we were in from Toronto and ordered a pizza from here, and loved it. It is a delightful \"mom & pop\" kind of place, where the food tastes real, and the people who work there are friendly. We picked up, and the food was great.  Reasonable prices, fast.  All around, i'm a fan."}
{"text":"Their pizza is meh and overpriced. It's better than Dominos or pizza hut but that's like using McDonald's as your taste reference for burgers.   I thought the 1st time I tried their pizza it might have been just a bad day for them given the ratings in Yelp. Nope..2nd time is just the same.  There are much better pizza places in Montreal but not in the immediate area surrounding this place.  I tried their pastas which were pretty average. Average as in home made without any effort into the spices etc. Their tzatziki is good."}
{"text":"Many years before moving to the borough of St. Laurent I was aware this place was voted the best pizza in Montreal by both CFCF TV & CJAD radio, so when I had the chance to try I was not disappointed. Not sure when if opened, but the fridge they keep their ingredients looks like a well-working relic of the industrial age, as time has stood still, not in a negative, but a very old-style welcoming. I have two other restaurants for pizza within close proximity to this, each has their own merits that keep me returning."}
{"text":"Homey d√©cor, friendly staff, decent prices. A nice throwback Greek family-run restaurant."}
{"text":"great gourmet pizza!!! lots of topings and lots of cheeze.sauce is great and a little bit sweet. dought is yummy too.  try their special pizzas with onions and sausages on top of an all dressed  20 bux plus taxes for a medium all dressed and a bit more for the special,but it's really worth it!!"}
