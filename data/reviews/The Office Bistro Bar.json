{"text":"Wow, what a disappointment. It was over 10 minutes after being seated before a waiter asked what we wanted. 
We were there at lunch time but there was no lunch menu. We had to pay dinner prices at a Bistro! 
The fish & chips cost $15.95 and when they came there wasn't even a side of cole slaw. The tartar sauce was thousand island dressing, what's with that? The waiter said that's the only kind they had. 
The fish had a very strong flavor and the batter was an 3/4 of an inch thick all around. 
We won't be back."}
{"text":"Grew up in Ohio but moved away a short while back. Was back in town for the holiday season and had been to the office so decided to try the office bistro 12/26/16.
Food was delicious - had Baked Lobster Mac & cheese (recommended by server- glad she knew the menu/food). Drinks, good. Atmosphere was pleasant. People were friendly - specially our server -service was prompt...no complaints (thanks Carrie!) Would come back when visiting."}
{"text":"Totally disappointed in the new menu!  This has been a family favorite restaurant since opening and the new menu removed some of the best items. The Chicken Saltamboca, the Cuban sandwich and the burger selection are gone - HUGE mistakes!  These have been staple items since The Office opened and main reasons for us to keep returning.  My wife and I eat here about once a week and these great dishes must be brought back. The location, staff in the bar and the drink menu are fantastic! The Office has been 5 stars for our family since it opened - the new menu with none of the classic favorites drops the score. Please bring these dishes back."}
{"text":"Ate there the first time tonight.  Took the bartenders suggestion and ordered the ham and brie with apricot preserves.  It was not only loaded with the overly sweet preserves. the ham was kind of chewy and the brie had a strange sour after taste. I gave half of my sandwich away and my friend came to the same conclusion.  Not saying I would not give them a second chance but I for sure would stay away from anything with brie, ham, or preserves."}
{"text":"First time in an area that I will be back to and I end up here for dinner. Appetizers are normal travel fare but are up a notch..... Try the cheese and meat plate and it is above most! Not a complaint from my seasoned travelers on dinner and a very good selection of adult beverages. Service OUtSTANDING! Will go back on next trip into town and see if I can give them 5 Stars."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to check this place out for our 6 Month wedding anniversary in January 2013 as it is close to our house and was pretty new to the Falls. When we walked in, I thought the interior was beautiful. We were seated right away. However, being impressed by it ended there. When it came time for eating my food, I was NOT impressed at all. It definitely lacked any sort of flavor, was very bland. The prices were not worth it, and the interior of the restaurant is very deceiving. I expected better food. I don't think I will ever return."}
{"text":"Friday we were excited to try your new menu. Every menu item sounded new and delicious. Our lunch was a bit off the mark. The office burger was properly prepared but the toppings were rich and sloppy. The veggie burger was dull and mushy I would not order that again."}
{"text":"Was there yesterday for lunch.  My friend and I both enjoyed our meals.
The one problem was the service, and they weren't that busy.  I don't believe it was the server, rather the kitchen.  A server can't serve what isn't ready.  When the food was finally delivered, it was hot and had not been sitting under heat lamps, thus the feeling the problem was in the kitchen."}
{"text":"My hunny and I finally got a chance to visit the Office Bistro in Cuyahoga Falls and I was very impressed (or just really hungry). First things first the service was amazing! Our server was Nick (yes I remember his name lol) and he was Johnny on the spot. We are watching what we eat and Nick went to the kitchen and got an estimate of the calorie count for out and was actually happy to do so. As a matter a fact he offered (surprising right). I had the calamari which was delish and a lobster salad. My hunny got smoked mozzerella cheese and they had some typle of sauce on the plate was magnifcent and he also got a salmon dish that was also very tasty. So if you haven't noticed already I am a big fan and will definately go back. If you decide to go, ask for Nick :)"}
{"text":"First time at The Office for dinner and unfortunately probably the last. We ordered the walleye,  pork chop,  and skirt steak. Walleye was cooked perfectly, fennel sauce tasty, veggies and potatoes we're okay. Pork chop presentation was beautiful,  but that was the only thing that was good. Chop was so  tough, almost inedible.  The skirt steak could have been good only if the kitchen knew the correct way to cut the steak. Beans and rice were tasteless  The restaurant had only 2 other occupied tables so there was no good reason for the poor execution,  great presentation though. Service was just okay."}
{"text":"Any specials? Menu pricing was differnt than our check pricing (in the wrong direction).  Blackend chxn mac was flavorless.  Salt and pepper would go miles. Cole slaw was pure mayo.  Where was the acid?  And the s+p?  The Cuban was tasty. Luckily prosciutto is salty. Czr salad needed, what else? Salt and pepper!  And maybe some anchovie in the dressing. Croutons seemed like they came from a bag. They were good.  The drinks ( beer and margarita) were good.  But I don't go out to dinner just for the drinks. Saurcraut balls and crab dip were good. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Just had a perfect dinner here. The food was amazing and the staff including the manager were very prompt and professional. Looking forward to eating here again. Will probably try eating here for lunch during our next visit."}
{"text":"Long time resident of CFO, returned for visit and now proud to have a good fun restaurant to visit!  Thank you The Office.  From Chicago now, BTW."}
{"text":"We went to the office this weekend and had a horrible experience. Our waiter Jason was very slow and had to apologize twice for \"disappearing\" on us. He was clumsy and forgetful. He had to come back to our table numerous occasions to clarify what we had ordered. Not sure why he didn't just write it down?!?! I ordered the strip steak and it was tasty but my mashed potatoes were cold and tasted like instant mashed potatoes. For the price, I would have expected better quality.  Someone else had to prepare our bill for us since jason had \"disappeared\" again.  We were dining rather late and the place wasn't very busy and much of the wait staff was gathered around the bar. We received a short apology but no compensation for the awful service. I will not be returning to the office."}
{"text":"Went there with friends after a Kentucky Derby party. When I spend $60 on dinner for two, I prefer the food be edible, and portions large enough to not still feel hungry after I've eaten. The chicken breast in my wife's chicken saltimbocca was tiny to start with and so overcooked that a third of it was inedible. Same with my lobster mac - dry and overcooked, and a small porion. We've been to the other location for brunch a few times and liked it, but this dinner was a disaster."}
{"text":"Sad and disappointing! Entered the establishment at 12pm. Hostess started to seat me but took a call. I seated myself in the bar, at the bar.  Good bartender.  Served me a reliable iced  tea right awsy. The salmon burger i ordered arrived 26 minutes  later.  Not the best. How can something be burnef and undercooked?"}
{"text":"Great food from the french dip to the blackened scallops.  Great for a night out with friends or with the wife.  The owner is a great guy and always friendly, something you don't always see these days."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful time here! The drink prices during happy hour great. I met a couple of friends that were on from out of town. They were impressed with the service and menu. And the desserts were amazing. I've heard rumors of the brunch at the Akron location being pretty off the hook. Can't wait to try it."}
{"text":"Have gone several times before and loved it, but this was definitely an off night (hopefully!).  Cheese bites were greasy, blueberry BBQ steak was stringy, cheeseburger was raw inside, pesto pasta was floating in oil, cantaloupe in the mozzarella appetizer was so hard you couldn't get a fork in the melon ball.  We'll go again because it's usually great, but not last night.  (Also mentioned a bday at time of reservation and nothing was done until we were offered free dessert after the waiter saw the raw burger...!). Waiter was very pleasant!"}
{"text":"I have tried this place a few different times and am disappointed every single visit. I wouldn't waste your time.... Sorry."}
{"text":"Great drinks and food. Fantastic service. I went in for the first time a week ago and will definitely be going back. Every item my group ordered was delicious! The cucumber mojito is one of the best drinks in town and the Parmesan truffle fries are amazing. Our server, Carrie, was a rockstar! She was on top of everything and a had a great personality."}
{"text":"My friends, family and I have been to The Office twice now and I feel its time to review. We have sampled at least 10 meals between us and they have all been excellent. So far the favorites are the lobster mac and cheese, ahi tuna, the mussels with linguini and the stuffed pepper appetizer. Their drink list is great, with something for everyone on the menu. ( The win-win is my favorite drink, delicious!) It's now one of our favorite local places to have a date night, family dinner or night out with friends. They have a fire pit outside that's perfect for fall evenings!"}
{"text":"After first opening my wife and I had some awesome meals there. The ahi tuna ,ribeye steak, and scallops were fantastic. We recommended the restaurant frequently. After a bit of time we finally went back, and there was a different menu. Definitely a downgraded menu. No bread with our salads or meals, or while waiting obnoxiously long for our orders to be taken. The only steak on the menu is a 10oz strip for 24 dollars.... Let that sink in...... I ordered it rare; it was medium at best with the outside edges completely gray. 1/2\" thick at best. This is the kind of steak that wouldn't be welcomed at golden coral. A real chef would be embarrassed to have this on the menu. It was covered in gravy.. Who the hell eats a steak like that? I don't remember ever having such a bad experience based on food alone. What a shame that this place has fallen so far. They will not be in business much longer without a serious chef's advice. We will not be back until we hear of major changes."}
{"text":"Made the mistake of coming back because some friends wanted to meet. We had reservations for a party of 12. Waiter told us that we couldn't have the 4 most popular menu items because they were reserved for some private parties. When taking drink orders, one of our group was in the bathroom. His wife ordered him a drink and we were told that wasn't allowed. Keep in mind we are all in our late 30s. Fuck this place"}
{"text":"This place was great! I was visiting a friend who lives in the area, and they wanted to take me to dinner. We had an appetizer, a few cocktails, and the special of the night. Everything was excellent. What really topped off the night was the service. If you go to this location, make sure to ask for Carrie. We were there on a Monday night and that's a sure night that she works. She was friendly and funny. We sat there and talked to her for a good hour. She was the one who suggested a lot of the stuff that we got because I couldn't make up my mind. She knows what's good and made our time there very enjoyable. If I lived closer, I would go back every Monday just to talk to her because I haven't had that type of serves in a long time."}
{"text":"We always host our corporate events at the Sheraton, but we wanted a new spot! The office is a year old, has a modern fresh clean decor, and good food. We rented the private room for 35 people and had a great time. The crew was very hospitable and efficient. We will return!"}
{"text":"We stopped by today for thanksgiving lunch. It was great!!! The servers, cooks, everyone very polite and professional. 
Food was great, home made turkey and ham and great selection of sides. Plus desserts!"}
{"text":"The ambiance is the best at this location and drinks and service are on point. I've been here three times and each time I come out having a good time!! :) to the point that Iam planning to have my bday dinner here."}
{"text":"Slow/poor service, food is overpriced.  Pretzels w cheese are pretty awesome though."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, timely service, great feel. Overall relaxed atmosphere. Friendly patrons, tv at bar with sports and nice bistro next door. Excellent service!! Next to river front with park across the street and a great Sheraton a walk away if you want to tie one on..which we are in the process of doing. Back to the task at hand."}
{"text":"My Husband and I recently went  for our second time.   Our first visit, we had Cubans, and I tried a couple of the speciality Martini's.  The Cubans were very average, and the martini's were nothing special.    Our second visit, we had the sausage stuffed peppers, which were good, but nothing special.  We each had a bowl of French Onion Soup, which was straight out of the microwave and to hot to eat for quite a while.  The bread in the soup  turned to mush, and the soup was very sweet...then, we each had a wrap, anticipating that we would bring home half for lunch tomorrow, but did not even have them box the leftovers .. My Husband would not even try my vegetable wrap, it looked so unappealing, , and it was .  I tried a couple of Martini's again...still average... Our bill was close to $100 dollars, pretty pricy for average..."}
{"text":"First time here and definitely not the last. The parking is a little sparse there, but not too bad. I got a martini, which I didn't even know was actually a martini until I ordered it. It was called \"the write up\" and it was good. I'd love to try more of their drinks. There was a huge party there while we were there, so our waitress was very nice and advised us that we would want to make our selection fast so she could get the food in before them. It still ended up taking a while but we didn't mind too much. They give bread and I got a side salad with white French (not as good as other white French dressings I have had, but not bad) and I had the apple bacon burger while my boyfriend had the Ohio dip. He food was delicious, and if you go online before you visit, you can get a coupon sent to your phone for 10% off."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this place for the 1st time last night... We were highly impressed!!!
We started with the sweet potato appetizer which comes with a brown sugar maple dipping sauce, I feel I could have made a meal just from those because they were amazing!!
My main dish was the steak Marsala pasta and it was to die for.... The pasta was cooked perfectly and the egg on top was just runny enough to mix with the sauce...my only complaint was that I could have eaten 2
platefuls but my body would have overloaded on carbs!!! 
My husband had the pulled pork tacos and said they were very yummy and he would def. get them again!
My only true complaint was that the website said its special for Tuesday was the pulled pork tacos for $5 but we were charged full price at $7... We didn't complain or say anything while we were there and truly don't care about the price now. We will def. go back to this place and I look forward to trying more on the menu!!"}
{"text":"Drinks were great.  Got \"the intern\" and loved it.  Also tried their hummus and just went crazy for it."}
{"text":"The food was good. We had the lobster mac and cheese and the ahi tuna. Atmosphere was nice, although the fake fire playing on the TV was odd. The only issue I had with the night was the cost of the draft beer. $7.50 for a 4.5 ABV Jackie O's Firefly. That's nuts. It's only 3 bucks at Jackie O's tap room. If they want to gouge people on beer prices, they need to include the prices on the beer list. That was sneaky."}
{"text":"Tries too hard to sell sub-par food."}
{"text":"Good but loud.  When for a small get together and had a hard time carrying a conversation with someone more.than one.chair away with the noise.  Food was good though"}
{"text":"If anyone in management or ownership of The Office reads this BE ADVISED-- this place closed without notifying us and refunding our deposit for a rehearsal dinner!!!!  Definitely NOT COOL!!  A lawsuit is pending. Shame on you"}
{"text":"There was nothing amazing about our recent visit to THE OFFICE.  The misses of the trip seemed to far outweigh the hits.  Service was ok.  Food was pretty good though we did have to send back onion soup that was served luke warm.  We went for Sunday Brunch only to discover that the brunch menu was about 4 items.  We all just opted for sandwiches & soups off of the regular menu.  The biggest hits at the table seemed to be a bowl of chili and the french fries.  I would like to go back to try the dinner entrees.  I'm thinking our experience of underwhelm was more related to start-up issues of the new location.  While none of us in the group are freeze babies, the restaurant & restrooms were startling cool/cold."}
{"text":"I went here a couple nights ago with a bigger group, we let the server know that we were just getting drinks, and only one person was getting food. We were told that he would get drinks and then come back.... 30 minutes later I was able to place a food order.... 30 mins after that I got my meal.  I ordered fish tacos.  This was the biggest disappointment of an excuse for fish tacos I have ever had. Mostly cabbage, there was maybe two bites worth of cold salmon thrown on two tacos... I was not impressed at all. My water was never refilled for the two hours we were there. I am not in a hurry to go back."}
{"text":"Staff is attentive and the food is ok for the price.  I had ordered the hamburger which came rare instead of medium.   Fries were ok.  I had ordered the cheesecake and found it to be different than other cheesecakes I have eaten in the past.  This one seemed to be half whip cream topping and the other have what I took to be the actual cheesecake.  It was still good but different from what I was expecting.  I did notice the bill did not add up correctly.  (The tax and subtotal added incorrectly and made our bill more expensive.)  I brought this to the attention of the manager on duty who said he would fix this."}
{"text":"If it is possible for a restaurant to stand you up, I think that is what happened to our table of 3.  There were two other tables filled when we were sat by the hostess.  We sat.....and sat....looked around....and sat. We sent one from our group up to the hostess stand to ask for service.  The hostess apologized and said she would find someone right away.  We sat....and sat....looked around....decided to go next door."}
{"text":"I've had dinner at the Office Bistro twice and was not impressed.  I don't find the atmosphere attractive... the main dining area is big and the tables etc are kind of old school.  The bar is ok but again the food was only ok.  I had the Cuban sandwich and it was bulky, too much meat not enough pickles etc.  The fries were good... they need to step it up with Burntwood around the corner...  Don't think that I will go back."}
{"text":"We recently held my mother's 90th birthday dinner celebration at this lovely spot right on front Street in Cuyahoga Falls. It was an easy walk from the Sheraton Suites where we were staying. The food was delicious. The service was superb and the use of the private room made it just perfect! The management and staff bent over backwards to make sure we had everything we need."}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner here this evening. Ahi tuna was tasty and nicely presented. We also had the sauerkraut balls which were different and good! We arrived late and the service was quick and efficient."}
{"text":"The salmon was AMAZING! I was so sad when I finished it. We got the Asian lettuce wraps for a starter and they were awesome as well. Our server was friendly and checked on us enough without being overbearing. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Awesome place!  Love the bar and the expanded menu!  Beer, martini, and wine list is awesome!"}
{"text":"Had dinner with my family on Christmas Eve. It was not very crowded and the servers were extremely friendly but our meal, beginning with our appetizers were extremely long in being brought to our table. The meal took even longer and most of the entrees were literally both cool, not warm as well as soggy. 
In addition, the server actually brought bread to the table only after the entrees were either completed or not finished. Completely disappointed and my wife even called a few days later to express our frustrations with a meal that was well below our expectations and they did not even have the courtesy to return a phone call to a customer who's bill was in excess of $ 250 for that night. 
Coincidently, friends of our had dinner here on New Years Eve and experienced almost the exact same results from the start of their meal to the finish. 
It's certainly unfortunate but it does appear that this type of results for dining here have now become the norm rather than the exception."}
{"text":"Our waitress was absolutely amazing. Really good drinks. The mozz  bites were amazing. Burger was a little undercooked, but all around a really nice restaurant."}
{"text":"A Mediocre experience to say the least. I got the Cuban sandwich and they forgot the Swiss cheese and the excuse was they have a \"new chef\". My fries were soft and it was just ok. The appetizer was the best thing and even that was texturally weird. Cantaloupe balls, mozzarella balls and prosciutto  with mint glazed. Very weird so weird at least the bathrooms were clean and they had a large beer and cocktail menu. Overall a sad experience and really hope they step up their game because downtown cuyahoga falls is growing and they don't want to be left behind."}
{"text":"We made a reservation because of the sauerkraut balls and because it was walkable from our hotel but I think we all left with stomachaches and were happy we didn't get a full lunch. When we got there we decided that we would do a bunch of \"shareables\" (appetizers) and some soups and salads for lunch. The menu made everything sound amazing but when the food came out the sauerkraut balls were really the only thing that was really good. The Brussels sprouts had a weird aioli that took away their crispness. The calamari made me feel nauseous and didn't really have anything special about it, our fault for getting calamari in a land locked state. The pretzels left little to be desired and the artichoke dip was bland. We had ordered one salad and a soup that never came which we counted as a win because we were ready to go. The staff was nice enough but with the food only being ok we won't be coming back. Their beers were good so maybe a late night drink would be worth the trip."}
{"text":"Horrible service being told by a rude bartender that they weren't sure if we should even order food due to poor new management!"}
{"text":"I've love going here for lunch or dinner, but their happy hour is just a good deal. Marie is just a wonderful server. I would always request her to wait on our table because she is just wonderful! I will always come back!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AWESOME!!!! So classy and a great atmosphere! The eclectic and rustic vibe is romantic and calming. The general manager Rick and bartender Dario were so nice to us! Please eat or get a drink here, it's a must see :) have fun and enjoy, thanks again!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Two and a half stars. Been here a couple times. Perfectly adequate. Nothing particularly standout or noteworthy, they serve up decent food at decent prices. Avoid the wine by the glass if you can. Their bottles are relatively cheap for what you get ('08 Silver Oak Alexander Valley for $68?? Do they know what a bargain that is?).

Their cocktail menu leaves a lot to be desired. Every manner of vodka mix imaginable, but no (or very few) whiskey cocktails. Guys, get with the times.

They have a huge screen with a grainy CCTV view of the falls.  Not really sure what the point is, but it's huge, garish, distracting and out of place. If you don't have a river view, don't try to fake it."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere! Liz, our waitress was fantastic and personable. The bartender made a mean martini and the hostess was adorable."}
{"text":"The Bartenders were entertaining, lively and refilled drinks quickly. They were great as a team during a very busy night."}
{"text":"If you change your menu, you should also change it on your website. The old menu was much better than the one they have now. Also, there should not be that much fat on a steak being served in a restaurant. The staff was very friendly and helpful, however we will unlikely return unless there are changes to the menu items and quality of food."}
{"text":"Came in for a few cocktails and this little short lady was behind the bar yelling at people in front of customers... it was very rude I think her name was Arlene ... I could tell the employees were very perplexed by her demeanor if this is how this place is ran I will not be coming back"}
{"text":"I had lunch here for an event last fall, and it was very good!  We had a relatively large group and a pretty short timetable, and they handled both factors with ease.  The macaroni and cheese was delicious, and I'd definitely order it again.  I had a taste of the bruschetta and fried mozzarella appetizers, and both were very good as well.  Others in the group enjoyed salads, but said the sandwiches were only okay.  For full disclosure, I didn't pay for my meal, but I got a look at the menu and prices seemed reasonable.  The building itself was very pretty, with big picture windows and the river just across the street.

I'm not very familiar with Cuyahoga Falls, but I'd happily make another trip to The Office if I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The Office is a bit nicer and upscale place (a step up from casual dining, but no tie required). They had some pretty good cocktails including the Paid Vacation. I got the house salad and buffalo chicken flat bread, but I enjoyed and would recommend. Nothing made me immediately start to plan my next trip, but that's okay I'd still go back in the future."}
{"text":"Wow, went for Mothers day and was a real disappointment! 

The brunch special came with 2 greasy eggs, 2 greasy pieces of wonder bread and 2 greasy pieces of ham. The strawberry and orange slice were the only edible items. They told us they couldn't do poached eggs ( can't boil water).

We ordered and 2 other tables came in behind us, they got their food quick (different server) we waited 45mins for the cold egg plates.

Terrible service, the server didn't come back to our table in the back room after taking or order... and the manager brought out our cold food.

Neither of us ate the Waffle House-like breakfast and paid $30 for the worst food ever!

Pass on this place, the combination of bad service and terrible food is awful."}
{"text":"I would like to give this restaurant higher stars because of their food.  We had many different options on the menu and we all throughly enjoyed the food.  The tomato bisque was yummy, our mom wanted to have everyone try it!  Our server was very sweet, but service was slow from the bar.  Could have made much more on the tab with faster bar service.  Overall, food was very very good!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I recently dined at the Office with another couple for my birthday. I had heard good things and was thrilled it met (and exceeded) my expectations!

The food was great (scallops) and it came out very hot (always important to me). My husband had a buffalo chicken wrap that was spicy and gone before i got a chance to try it. He said it was very good.  The menu was perfect for us b/c I am more of foodie than he-He could get bar food and I could go for fine dinig. 

The drinks were also creative and amazing. I had the intern which was a martini involving basil and grapefruit juice. Really good! We had a few others that were great too. 

We will be back! Beats the terrible chains in this area anyday!"}
{"text":"Great interiors package! I love the variety of lighting, the fixtures, the finish materials & the layout- all very important to me.  They all blend to creative a lovely ambience.

The service was exceptional! Took my daughter here after her middle school band concert.  We ordered the stuffed peppers appetizer & split a reuben.  We were very happy with the presention and taste of the food.

I have been to the orginal location several times. I live smack down in the middle of both & would like to give more business to the new location.  I even contacted them about a private dinner party for my upcoming wedding.  

Great for groups.  The bar seems lively.  Make a reservation if you don't want to wait!

Valet & street parking!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this place is classy and elegant, and the prices are not astronomical, but the food -- a kind of clever spin on classic dishes -- can be a tad hit-and-miss, and the staff is equally hit-and-miss. Still, if you're looking for a romantic little nook along the river, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I've been here a total of 4 times and each time I leave not impressed.  It has the look and feel of a restaurant you would find in Chicago or New York City but the quality and variety of the food does not match the price.  The appetizers and entrees cost too much, especially for lunch and for the quality.  Their French Onion soup is suppose to be really good.  I've had better at Panera Bread.  There' s barely any cheese on it.  The wedge salad was delicious.  For lunch, they were slow to bring out the food.  We waited forever.  The menu doesn't have a lot of variety to it.  You would be better off going down the street to Moe's or something."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, lame service.

The vibe of the place itself is cool, especially on winter nights with the fireplace lit. The bar area is nice, and a cool place to hang out even if you don't end up getting a table-which is a process in itself.
We had reservations for 7:00, walked in to a rather large party waiting before us, but that was it, 1 party. Then a couple tailed in behind us, and another, and another, 2 of which didn't even have reservations. Now the only reason we made reservations to begin with is because of what I've heard around town, they were definitely recommended by everyone I talked to, so I did. If I knew it wouldn't have helped, I wouldn't have made them.

We waited probably 30 minutes, the whole lot of us in the lobby, and eventually the big party got their table and cleared out the waiting area to us and the three other couples. Now, like I said, we were definitely there first, but apparently no hostess cared. Not to mention when a hostess calls your name, she will literally just quietly sound your name. The only way I knew someone else was being called for their table was because one woman was standing pretty close to the desk and she was the only one that could accurately hear her. I was pretty certain she called our table, (since no one else got up either) and by the time we got to the desk, another woman and her husband took our reservation! So we waited some more...and then the next couple (without reservations) went on. Then finally the last couple went on, and we were there, alone in the lobby, the only ones with actual reservations, and we were the last to be seated (45 minutes after arriving mind you).

The food itself was fine, the ahi tuna for our appetizer was good, my lobster mac and cheese was actually quite appetizing, but my boyfriends meal-mediocre. He ordered the some chicken pasta dish-with no seasoning, no taste. Oh well, we live and we learn.

We compared this restaurant to Crave in downtown Akron, very similar styles. The Office had a significantly smaller selection though, Crave has much more to consider, and better service and food as well!

Bottom line is, there are better options than this place. Looks inviting, but the service and food is mediocre. You can get better in the area."}
{"text":"The problem with so many of these New American cuisine restaurants is that they try to be inventive with their menus too much. It's much better to stick to well done staples than over season and over cook.  I ordered the lobster mac and cheese and the amount of food I got was not befitting the price. My boyfriend got the ahi tuna and it was overcooked. In hindsight we should've sent it back but it should never have reached the table overdone in the first place. In addition I only saw the server three times during our visit. The food and quality of service did not reflect the price I paid."}
{"text":"Food is exceptionally upscale and overpriced, and the menu is pretty limited. However, the interior is beautiful and there is a cool option to sit outside by a gas fire. The food I did order was phenomenal!

Great spot for drinks, not so much for a meal."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar and had an appetizer and a drink. The appetizer - crab dip was fair but the service was nonexistent. Bartender was busy taking selfies with the cute gals at the end of the bar. We might of had another drink if we could of got the bartender's attention."}
{"text":"To write an accurate review, I would be required to dine and enjoy the food. This didn't occur.

After waiting 45 minutes for a table to become available, (our party of 6 was the only group waiting) we had to ask the hostess if we were going to be seated at the recently available table. To our surprise, she informed us that we wouldn't be seated any time soon as the kitchen was backed up. I can actually understand this situation. What I can't understand is why we were not told this earlier in our wait. I am still baffled at the circumstances and completely dissapointed. What was supposed to be a fun night out with friends turned into a terrible situation.....At least we had something to talk about."}
{"text":"Very unimpressed!

I had the veal scallopini which was awful.  Veal should be soft and tender, yet this was so tough I could barely cut it with a knife.  It was so chewy I felt like I was eating taffy!  I'm surprised I didn't get food poisoning from this disgusting meal!  It was overpriced for poor quality food.  Everything we ate there was extremely greasy (floating in grease!!) and extremely salty!! Save your money, don't go here! 
I definitely do NOT recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Went to the office tonight for dinner. This is my wife's favorite restaurant and she was apprehensive when she noticed that the menu had changed. Well, we found out that they had hired a new chef who had brought their own recipes. I was hopeful because it looked like the new chef had added some Latin flavored to the recipes. Once we received our food we were both disappointed. The food was cooked perfectly but there was no flavor and the presentation left something to be desired. Not sure if I will continue to return."}
{"text":"Food is great!  Location is great as well, servers aren't as attentive as they should be."}
{"text":"I have been to the office for lunch a couple times. Salads and stuff and it was okay. We just went for Easter Brunch today, and it was horrible. I should have known because it was easy to get a reservation and it was half empty the whole time. We waited 10 minutes for service. Some of the hot food on the buffet was cold. The bagels on the buffet were hard and not cut in half. They had lamb with no mint jelly, amd chicken fingers with no condiments. When we told the manager the food was cold her response was 'it should be warm its in the chafing dishes which keeps it warm'. It was a very disappointing brunch, and not worth the $27 a person. We will not be back."}
{"text":"This may have been one of the most disappointing places I have been. I heard great things and it completely let me down. We tried a couple burgers, chicken sandwich, lobster mac and the calamari. The calamari was the only thing I would even call decent. Everything else was way over cooked and dry. The waitress knew nothing about the food or drink menu. They have an impressive beer menu, although they didn't seem to have any of what we wanted in stock?  I live 3 minutes from this place and I will never return."}
{"text":"Grew up in C. Falls and was recently back visiting family.  Decided to check out The Office as I've heard good things about it.  Stopped in for drinks & appetizers.  Good selection, although a little pricey.  Had a fantastic server named Carrie.  She was friendly, knowledgeable of their menu and made great recommendations.  Will go back again the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Glad to see a new Office in Cuyahoga Falls! This one has a ton of space, which makes it a nice dining option - though they fill up quickly, so be sure to book a res. I appreciate that they use OpenTable for reservation-making, which is rare in this area. 

The Office's menu is large & varied, with something for everyone, & their staff seems very willing to make changes, substitutions, etc. to accommodate dietary needs (I;m allergic to mushrooms, my friend is on a weird diet, stuff like that). The food isn't necessarily anything to write home about, but it's very good - classic, reliable, tasty, comes out quickly.

They also have a great drink list, more interesting than most bars in the area (especially Falls bars!) I find the prices manageable & the drinks usually delicious, though the bartenders aren't necessarily known for being friendly or attentive. My major complaint is that The Office closes at midnight, which means last call comes around 11:50. I was hoping for a better bar scene in CF when The Office & Craft opened, & while they've certainly elevated the options, most weekend nights still end in a local dive bar for me (love you, River City) because I'm still not old enough to retire before midnight."}
{"text":"I was a huge fan of this place. Usually great beers on tap, and always a good drink menu to go towards. I've tried numerous dishes there, and always hard to decide, until the new menu. To say the least, it's horrible. Prices are way up, and selection way down. I had the chicken tacos, and I would have to say probably one of the worst dishes I've ever had. Absolutely no flavor to them. I will not be a returning customer if this continues. Service is always great, it's a shame what they had to do to the menu."}
{"text":"Expensive and just blah. Two beers and two desserts was $26. We had to ask about the desserts as they weren't on the menu and their taste wasn't that great. The service was acceptable, but for a busy Friday night with a festival going on, they were surprisingly empty."}
{"text":"I foolishly assumed that a menu item called \"Grilled Chicken Caesar\" in the salad column would be a Caesar salad with grilled chicken on it. Nope! It's a chunk of cheap grilled lettuce lightly drizzled in Caesar dressing with a piece of burnt chicken next to it and this weird cheese wafer thing. What a joke!"}
{"text":"I mean, it looks like a nice place to have a bite to eat and grab a drink. As a local I gave it a number of chances, I didn't even want to be impressed, I was just looking for a new bar to hang out in.  Instead I got an undercooked burger the first time.  A measured watered down Screwdriver the second.  A few good miller lights the third visit ( you cant mess that up). And on my final visit ever I was served a dirty martini.... with water in it.... water... because i'm not one to complain I drank a few more beers with my friends and then left.  If management reads this I would recommend that you encourage your bartenders to consider using alcohol in your drinks. If you're from out of town and reading this, don't bother. You might as well eat and/or Drink at the Sheraton or MOE's."}
{"text":"We go from time to time and sit at the bar. Food has been consistently good. Never had it be slow or bad like other reviews say. Bartenders are always friendly and attentive. Gets busy. Better than other restaurants around. We like burntwood tavern too which is close by."}
{"text":"the grilled chicken on a pretzel bun and the hummus was outstanding.  the french onion soup was ok, the bread was a little hard and not enough cheese.  the food did take an hour to get to us.  really the only reason we will be back is because of our server nick, he deserves a raise!!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed by The Office tonight. I thought the menu was overpriced, food was mediocre and service was average at best. It took 30 minutes to get a burger and 2 tacos on a Wednesday at 830pm which was mind boggling. 

I ordered a medium burger which came out medium well/well done. On a positive...the fries were good. 

My wife could only eat one of her two tacos as the chicken was dry and overdone (could have used sauce). 

Sadly I was expecting much more from The Office but it did not hit the mark. The space itself is beautiful they just need major improvements in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Well, I guess this place has closed so there's not much need to continue. That explains why it was always so empty when I'd go in. Service was 'meh'. But the Sauerkraut balls were da bomb dot com"}
{"text":"Ok...what?! I am really confused by the reviews here.  I am going to outline this so it's easy to understand. 

Decor/ambiance - 3.5 stars. Looks a bit trendy, but nice, clean and warm feeling.  

Beer - 3.5 stars. They have a nice craft draught list and bottle selection. But the first two beers I ordered they didn't have.  Doesn't matter how good the list is if you don't have it. 

Food - 1.5 stars.  Nearly inedible. I ordered the steakhouse burger medium. Was waaaay past well done.  It tastes like burnt beef with A1 sauce. That was all.  The cole slaw was pure mayo. I tried the lobster Mac and cheese and I got 2 pieces of shell in my mouth. The lobster was brutally overcooked as well.  The calamari was the only edible item I tried. It was at least cooked decent and seasoned.  I tried the chicken sandwich too - same deal, overcooked and flavorless. 

Service - 2 stars.  They never told us the specials. I had to ask.  No idea of the menu or items on it.  

I will not be back here.  I feel dirty by giving it two stars and not one. If you are required to go against your will, sit at the bar, get a beer (if they have it) and have an app.  But please eat your dinner somewhere else."}
{"text":"I was so excited when this opened up as i had heard such great things about their other location. I have been here on 3 different occassions, it is super loud inside, the servers were hired i think because they are good looking not friendly, and the prices for cuyahoga falls are way off the mark. I'm sorry, but a $5 beer and $12 drink, this is cuyahoga falls, not cleveland. The service is really my biggest issue.  I can go accross the street for the same prices to the Sheraton lounge and be treated like I am the only customer in the room.  At the Office, last time the waiter couldn't wait to get us out of there, he kept bringing the bill, and rushing us, barely made eye contact and was frankly awful. He kept handing us stuff then running away, again like we were keeping him. We had arrived at 10pm on a saturday for late dinner and drinks. The time before that we ordered a bottle of wine, it was a decent brand Geison Savignon Blanc, not high end not low, and it was a twist cap as more wines are moving to that, corks are unpredictable, and he asked us if we wanted to smell the cap and shoved it right up to my face. Then walked away. The time before that, they were put out that there was a group of 10 of us on a Tuesday, it wasn't busy at all. One would think they would be excited for the business.  Instead we had an indifferent host us seat us with an indifferent server, and it was early.  i really had no clue what was wrong.  I used to bartend for many years, and so did a few of my friends, we tip really well, it's odd that folks just assume to act a certain way. We dressed and looked nice each time, i really didn't get it.  I think they need to revisit their qualifications for hiring their staff."}
{"text":"We've been to The Office many times - love the atmosphere and the food. A huge change has taken place though - desserts were down to cheesecake. WHAT? You've had some wonderful desserts in the past - different selections that were fabulous. We took my son's girlfriend there for her birthday - what a disappointment - her pork chops were inedible. The hummus was so thick and dry it wasn't worth eating - no flavor either. We couldn't even get her a fabulous dessert for her birthday. What's up guys??? The menu has changed so much - everything seems simplified - brought down several notches. Even the martini selection is less. The special on Friday night was bbq - really? The Office special was bbq????? It's not summer - it is February. Plus, that's not the type of food you serve. The restaurant was not busy when we left around 7 p.m. You managed to change something that was not broken - why? We loved this place - it looks like we're going to have to find another favorite. The servers here are exceptional, too. Friendly, professional, just top notch. What a shame."}
{"text":"If your wife is a princess like mine, be prepared to shell out some big money for dinner.  The prices are actually very reasonable, but my wallet is looking forward to going back there sometime with a friend, and not ordering several courses.  The food and service were both fantastic.  There aren't enough fine dining choices in Cuyahoga Falls and this is a welcome addition to our food lineup.  I really got the impression that the staff here are giving 110% to impress the customers and our city."}
{"text":"had lunch at the office in Cuy. falls for the first time today. Oh My, it was terrible. They do not know how to make french onion soup at all. The wings were ok, but not crispy like we asked, and the salad was good but had only ONE type of lettuce, the bitter kind. Our waitress had a filthy apron on and it was only 11:30, the hostess was dressed poorly,  and their was DUST on every chair rung in the place. I was amazed how dirty it was for as busy as it gets. I will NEVER go back, certainly not worth the money. 6 wings for 10.00,  NOT  Beaus in Fairlawn is so clean and good, I will continue to go there"}
{"text":"Good service.  Great food.  Good atmosphere.

Walked here from the hotel across the street.  We ended up seated in a booth in the bar area, honestly, it was just a little loud, but I wouldn't have really even noticed we were in the bar.  I thought it was pretty busy on a week night for dinner in what seemed like a pretty empty area post 5pm.  I was impressed with our server's ability to make recommendations based on what they were interested in/feeling.  I had the Sesame Crusted Ahi Tuna.  It was delicious, but I was surprised that it was served cold, I obviously missed word 'chilled' in the description.  They also had a good mojito special."}
{"text":"Can't say I was terribly impressed.  Nice decor, interesting live video on a big screen TV of the river that's about 50 yards away from the restaurant.  The food was OK but not great, not worth the money.  I had the steak with frites - steak was nothing special, and the frites were no better than Five Guys.  Wife had the scallops, which were good, but nothing to rave about.  House salad had a nice house dressing.  Service was slow, which we didn't mind as we weren't in a hurry, but it also wasn't attentive - no asking if we wanted water, or another drink, we had to initiate things like that.  Might stop back some day and give it another try, but not in a hurry to."}
{"text":"We were looking for somewhere to try in the Falls area, this looked like a nice option from the outside.  We (2 adults and 2 kids) stopped in for a weeknight dinner, no wait so we stayed.  The ambiance is fine, Appears its trying to be more upscale but the videos of waterfalls were....interesting?  

Our food was OK, not terrific - but my husband's in a particular, a veg entree (ragout) with beans, was NOT good - beans were hard/undercooked, rendering it mostly inedible.  Kudos to our server, though, she was appropriately apologetic and comp'ed this entree.  

Not impressed, likely won't need to come back given other options."}
{"text":"Went to this location on a Sunday evening so there was no wait and we were waited on promptly. Our group had several appetizers but the calamari was by far the best. I had the salmon salad and should've  asked for dressing on the side. Wait time was appropriate, drinks were great, and food portions and quality was worth the visit. Final tab was a bit steep to make this a frequent stop, but worth a date night out. Great atmosphere and additional bar in back."}
{"text":"Me and a friend went to the office. They used to have the BEST wedge salad around!! Recently, they changed the menu and It had FUNIONS , a fried egg, and ranch dressing. So not a typical wedge salad. Next time I'll be sure to look out for the obvious unfortunate items on this salad."}
{"text":"We were staying across the street for a wedding and ventured over for lunch. We say at the bar and had some drinks and lunch and had a chill soccer watching meal. The stuffed pepper appetizer is amazing and I highly recommend the Dog Fish Head Peach draft. Not too sweet but a very nice summer beer.   The bartender was great and we had an overall very good experience."}
