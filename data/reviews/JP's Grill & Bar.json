{"text":"My 4 stars is based on the food. My 2 coworkers and I had the jerk chicken today for lunch (Friday, got there at 12:30) and we all found it really good. Maybe because we had to wait 45 minutes and that anything at that point tasted good :P And there weren't that many orders ahead of us. Coworkers had the oxtail on a previous visit and raved about it. Food is good but slow and service is nice and friendly. Atmosphere was your cozy neighbourhood pub. We would go back for the food and will call ahead of time and place an order for pick up ;)"}
{"text":"The only good thing I have to say about this place is that the lady at the bar was very, very nice. Other than that, the food was disgusting.

Two of my colleagues and I went one Friday for lunch as we heard good things about the jerk pork and jerk chicken. We ordered four jerk pork entrees (one to take back to my other colleague). Upon paying, the lady at the bar said that she better go and check that they have enough. She came back and told us that there was enough for three so my colleague ordered a jerk chicken to accommodate the rest of us.

We waited a good 30 minutes for the food. When we got back to the office, we noticed the chicken was a teensy piece of thigh. The jerk pork was saturated in salt and the portion was about 4 onces (2 onces fat). I just threw mine away as it was so gross. All of us felt super bloated all night from the salt or MSG."}
{"text":"I will never be back on a Monday for \"seafood mondays\". While the food is always good, the service is horrendous. Your meal might not even get to you. It has happened to me and others I know many times. Just this past Monday I made a $100 plus order, waited about an hour to pick it up. After waiting 20 minutes for one of the girls to check the kitchen for my order she came back to tell me I have to wait another 3o minutes for my food. I walked out. That's my 3rd time walking out.
Their kitchen isn't ready for \"seafood mondays\" meaning it needs an upgrade, because it can't handle the amount of orders that's coming in. More servers with better attitudes would be good to.
As much as I love their food, the experience I always get from there is no good. I always leave there in a bad mood."}
