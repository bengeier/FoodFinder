{"text":"I live around the corner from this place and was desperate one day and decided to give it a try....it is delicious!  It is now my favourite shawarma place.  The chicken is not fatty and is flavoured very well.  The tomatoes are ripe (so rare), they don't skimp on toppings. I get the small chicken shawarma salad and they pack it with lots of veggies and lots of meat for $5.  Their sauces are also delicious!  Check it out you won't be dissapointed.  They make their own homemade bread (white and Whole wheat) and many flavours of bolani too.  Owner is always there and very focused on providing a good customer experience."}
{"text":"I really wish this place would open again. It was the best shawarma place in east york. Everything was always fresh and the owner took being clean very seriously! Farsad (the owner) was a great guy and his food was amazing. I hope he opens another place in the future."}
{"text":"We stopped by at this place randomly, and were definitely not disappointed! It had a big sign saying \"new management\" out front.  Everything looked fresh, they even make homemade bread, prices very reasonable, friendly staff, the owner was very kind and helpful, the shawarma's were delicious, and they were made quick. The owner was very appreciative of our business."}
