{"text":"This is a great break from all the sports bars in the area.  They do a great job with spices and if you like spicy go for any dish made with green curry sauce."}
{"text":"Food has generally been great. I do feel it is pricey and they would do a lot more business if they lowered what they charged (my entree was $21). I ordered pick up and asked for rice noodles instead of rice and it was a three dollar upcharge for a tiny portion. They did not tell me it would be a three dollar upcharge when I placed the order and you think when I brought up the issue when I picked up the $75 order that they would have said \"do not worry about it\" but they exchanged it for brown rice. I will be making more Thai food at home using rice noodles that cost $1.29 for an entire bag. The food is very good."}
{"text":"Best oriental restaurant we have found. We like the two \"best\" oriental places in Charlotte on occasion, but Thai House has now replaced those without question.  We have been three times.  Each visit was better than the last.   House Fried Rice is cooked and seasoned to perfection and my wife, who lived in Singapore, swears that this food equals what she had there.  We will certainly be back very soon."}
{"text":"The best Thai food that I have found in Charlotte!  I have dined on multiple occasions and I have never been disappointed.   The environment is always comfortable and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"I dint like the starters! But the fried rice was very good ! It had unique taste ! The starter was not fried  properly! And they don't respect customers well! A smile will do !"}
{"text":"We moved from DC areas and we just wanted to try out this place. Food is delicious  and I think Pad Thai & curry are great. We will be back"}
{"text":"My wife and I were frequent diners at the Thai House's university location when we both worked in that area so we were delighted to discover that they were opening a new location close to home. 
It is located in a small strip mall behind Starbucks on W. Catawba Ave.
We stopped in for lunch yesterday to see if they were as good as the other location and we were not disappointed. All meals start off with a complementary bowl of soup which is always very good. Both of us ordered our favorite Pad Thai, \"Thai style\". Make sure you order it this way! It is a bit different from the traditional Pad Thai on their menu. It is served with bean sprouts, sugar, red pepper flakes, chopped peanuts and a lime wedge all on the side, so you can add as much or little as you like according to your taste. In my opinion, this is the most flavorful dish I have had in any restaurant, anywhere! I love it that much! Oh yeah, they serve it with one of the best spring rolls you will ever taste. Always crispy on the outside and full of flavor. 
Do yourself a favor and try them out. I know I will be a regular from now on."}
{"text":"Awesome Thai food... The best around.  Yellow Curry is great!  My wife and I love Thai food and were hoping a good restaurant would open in Cornelius, and now it has.  We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Some of the best Thai in Charlotte. Massaman Curry is amazing. So glad they opened a location on my street!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend their Chicken Pad Thai, extra spicy! I called in a to-go order that was ready in 10 minutes. It was still piping hot when I arrived home. Perfect combination of spice and a good amount of chicken. As an avid lover of Basil Thai, I am thrilled to find a local Thai place that is right on par!"}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and my husband and I went and it was the best Thai food we have ever had. The staff is so so nice. It is crazy clean and it's just a really nice atmosphere. The food is very affordable. It's decorated so nicely. We will definitely be back soon! Well done!"}
{"text":"I didn't like there pad thai was too sour the only thing that was good is  their curry."}
{"text":"Ordered Thai Iced Tea, Green Papaya Salad and Spinach Chicken Pot Stickers. The iced tea was exceptional, but the papaya salad was way too spicy and wet. I've had better green papaya salads in other thai restaurants and was hoping I'll get to taste something similar here. And the pot stickers looked like wantons, I wanted something like dumplings/pot stickers. But otherwise, food is good, just that I've had better and hence, average rating."}
{"text":"Great food, reasonable prices... Had several dishes and everyone from my party was very pleased. Will definitely be back when in Cornelius!!"}
{"text":"Great service & food! Since moving to NC, my family has struggled to find good restaurants, particularly Thai food. Glad we found Thai House! We will definitely be back again.

My party ordered a bunch of different plates & shared family style. We started with a family favorite, Tom Kha soup. It was excellent. It was served without any spice in it, which is irregular, but not a big deal. We added several spoonfuls of sriracha, until we got the desired taste.

The rest of the meal consisted of Thai sweet & sour with chicken, red curry chicken, pad Thai with shrimp, & pad eggplant krapraw with beef. Each individual dish came with an egg roll. Everything was delicious! Each dish tasted fresh & full of flavor.

The bill was rather high, but that is not unusual with Thai restaurants.

Service was excellent! We took a while to finish our meal, & stayed till after closing. The staff was nice enough to stay open, & let us finish our food with no pressure to leave."}
{"text":"Small quaint Thai eatery in Cornelius w/very nice decor and extremely clean...we got wind of it via Groupon and loved it...I had the shrimp paid Thai and it was nothing short of amazing...he's not usually into Thai food but had the royal Thai curry and loved it...also the wait staff was very accommodating and professional..we will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here 4 times, and have always been very pleased! The first that caught me when I walked in was the decor. It's beautiful inside and the environment was relaxing. The service was top notch, my water glass was never less than half full, and everyone was kind.  The food is amazing! My favorite Thai food in the area. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Lunch is great! Pad Thai is on point, Kai Cashew is a favorite, and the curries are amazing.  The only problem is I order the same level of hot/spice, but it comes out different every time.  Half the time it's not spicy at all, half the time its way too spicy."}
{"text":"I'm going to rate this place based on Thai food specifically, because overall I'm not huge on Thai food, but this place was pretty good. We came on a Friday night around 8. It seemed to have been steady most of the night. 

We were seated promptly and our service was good. She kept our drinks full the entire night and was friendly. 

I opted for the yellow curry fried rice. This was fried rice that came with yellow curry powder, egg, carrots, sweet peas, and onions. I chose pork as my meat preference. It was pretty good overall. A very big portion and I left satisfied. The other two members of our party got pad Thai and the other got some kind of noodle dish. They both enjoyed their food as well. 

Like I said, I'm not a huge Thai food person, but if I had a hankering, this would be the place I'd go in the area. It was tasty and left me satisfied."}
{"text":"Such a great atmosphere for date night! We had the sweetest, most attentive waitress named \"Siri\", and they had the best Pad Thai we have ever had. So glad we found this little gem!"}
{"text":"Really upset that this place has 4 stars.  Very misguiding. Staff was sweet and the place was clean for the most part. 
The one star is for the food. We ordered cashew chicken and yellow curry with chicken. I'm not sure what we were served but it did not taste like chicken. And ever since my first bite my stomach has not stopped turning. 
When the server came by she didn't ask how our food was but asked if we wanted boxes since we hadn't touched our food and the plates were 99% full. After we told her no she just took the plates and brought our check. No questions like \"was everything okay\".  Nothing. 
On top of that their prices are out of line. $14.95 for curry... which is premade sauce and some vegetables. Really really disappointed in the $30 we wasted here tonight."}
{"text":"This place just blows my mind I just thought that coming here was the coolest thing in the whole world the staff was great the food was good and I enjoyed everything that they had to offer I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here on a whim opting over our usual choices for Asian cuisine in the area.
We wish we hadn't. 
I asked for sparkling water (listed on the menu) and was told that they didn't have it. Our server replied we have tap water, would you like that? I asked if they had bottled water and she smirked and said no. I don't even feed my dog tap water out of Lake Norman. There's a freaking nuclear power pumping god knows what on a man made late with zero natural current. No.
I kindly opted out and got a tea.
We ordered the Potstickers always a go to for us everywhere we go. These were the worst we've had. All spinach barely cooked, couldn't really see or taste any chicken and the sauce was way too sweet.
We decided to ask our server for recommendations and I decided to go with her recommendation of the Namprigpao. My husband got the yellow curry. 
They came out extremely quickly. Less than 5 minutes.
I gave 2 Stars bc my husbands curry dish was decent.
It all goes downhill from here.
The Namprigpao was probably one of the worst dishes I have ever been served in an Asian Restaurant.  I took 2 small bites and could not force myself to fathom continuing on.  It was filled with grease and so sicking sweet that I could've mistaken it for a dessert.  
When our server came back to check on us after the dish sat in the center of the table for a solid 15 minutes, I told her I couldn't eat it and that is was incredibly sweet.  She said 'Oh', walked away and never came back.  There was no 'sorry, would you like something else?'. Call me crazy, but at any restaurant I've ever worked at that reaction would've had me in hot water.
A few minutes later what I assume to be the manager came over to hand us our bill and see if we wanted a box.  I told her no and she took my full plate of food away.  We looked down at our check and they charged us full price for it!  Unreal.  I'm not looking to get free food by any stretch, but I did not eat my dinner.  I could understand if there was a dent made. When she came back my husband inquired about the charge and pointed out that I did not eat the food that was recommended by their server.  This is where it gets good. She rolled her eyes, snatched the check along with his credit card, rang it up while screaming at our initial server in the middle of the restaurant in another language, slammed it back down on the table and walked away.  
Our minds were blown.  I have never been treated so poorly in a restaurant by their staff in my life! We looked down to see if we were still charged for the dish and saw that it was at least taken off, then booked it the heck out of there. 
We will never go back here. Ever.  Save yourself, your wallet, tastebuds and your dignity and follow suit."}
{"text":"We usually eat at the one at university city.  Groupon brought us to this location.  We are a big fan of their pot stickers...not at this location...tough and chewy.  Next shrimp tempura...again tough and chewy.  Decided to lower our expectations about our entrees...pleasantly surprised.  Shrimp with eggplant delicious-sweet basil yum!  Shrimp and snow peas the freshest I've had in a long time!"}
{"text":"Very good food and served it fast.  Service not the best.  They forget the appetizer and just kind of put the dishes and food on the table."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by the Thai house in Cornelius for lunch today.  We both had pad krapraw.  The meal was great and the service was too.  If you are looking for Thai food in the Huntersville  / Cornelius area, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Pad Thai is awesome tonight! The Kang Mas. Curry is also spectacular! Seriously,  best Thai around! I have been going to the university location for over 13 years and recently moved to lake Norman! So glad they have a location here now! Must try this place!"}
{"text":"Posted hours til 3pm for lunch. Open sign was on. Walked in and they without even a greeting the girl up front said we are closing in 15 minutes, take it to go. We walked out. My parents used to own a restaurant. Customers were always welcome to come in during posted business hours, we never refused service. Seems like a bad business practice to me."}
{"text":"This new location is a great addition to the Thai House family.   The food is delicious and fresh. The  appetizers were great, especially the fresh rolls with shrimp and the chicken satays. The green papaya salad is fantastic, and can be ordered hot or mild. Curries and noodle dishes are great. The staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"This is one of the only Thai places I have found that is close of food you will actually get in Thailand. The staff is friendly! Pad Kee Mow, Pad Thai, and Rice Soup (obsessed) are all amazing. Order the Pad Thai \"thai\" style for a brown sauce. The only complaint is the heat is inconsistent, it just depends on who is working that night. 4 stars is generally full of heat and delicious, on occasion it has been on the mild side. Not to worry though, the staff will bring a little bowl of fresh chopped Thai chilis to spice it up if needed.  This has become a once a week habit, and a nice surprise in suburbia."}
{"text":"We come here twice a week for this flavor train of food. Absolutely the best Pad Thai I have ever had. And the Staff always treat you like family"}
{"text":"Writing this review a few days later as I was traveling after the  Valentine's Day but I just had to let the owner know and I hope he/she reads this. 
We are regular at the cornelius location. I would say my husband and I meet up for lunch at Thai house once a week in between work. We tried to do the same for Valentine's Day but also tried to include our children this time, my twins are 2 and they were with on their way with the sitter to meet us at the restaurant. When we went in it was full obviously it was valentines so we expected that. After a few minutes 2 tables got free, a booth by the bar and a two people table also by the bar. The hostess, AOM (her name) without greeting just took us the two seater table and went away. I even asked her for the booth but before I could finish my sentence she just walked away. We sat down and waited for 10 mins. I saw her in the meantime give another couple the table. 
My husband tried to walk up to her to request for the bigger table whenever it got free and are familiar with the staff and their faces as we are regulars. AOM without even listening to what he had walked up to the server just said, \" Sir please sit down in your place, we are busy. \" 
My husband was taken aback and felt very conscious. I gave it another try and my kids had also arrived so I waked up to the bar to ask the man, don't know his name to please call another server to help us with a situation. We were willing to wait. The other server also gave us a rude response and said we should have told them before sitting down. 
At that point we just left. One more lady who had walked in with us also had a similar situation and was made to sit at the bar, she left too. 
Should your staff not ask how many people table we need before seating us? I intentionally came early so I could place the order for the kids before they arrived hungry. 
I expressed my disappointment to AOM as we have had a similar server experience with her in the past but we didn't want to quit on a place because of their employees. 
Employees don't care as much as the business owner. 
Anyway, we ate at Huntersville at Thai sushi 101 and had a great Valentine's Day with our family. 
We didn't let the poor experience rain on our day. But this is something the business owner should be aware of as she mentioned respect is big in their culture, so is in ours. I'm asian too. 

Rating 3 as food is good, but not the experience. 
No respect for customers, forget the regular customers. People go out to eat to enjoy time with family and friends. If you can't cater to that need why should one come to you? There are other places in town."}
{"text":"I stopped into have lunch at the Thai House at Lake Norman.  What a treat!  I ordered Pad Thai and it was the best I've had.  Service is friendly and  quick but definitely not \" fast food Thai.\"  I will go back."}
{"text":"Pad Egg Plant Krapraw with chicken was fresh and yummy. My first time here, but it will not be my last."}
{"text":"The interior was completely redone, and the food was delicious.  The BBQ duck was great."}
{"text":"Very happy each time I come here.  Great steak salad this time, so good I'll try to duplicate at home.  Have had lemongrass tofu and other dishes and have been happy with all."}
{"text":"Excellent service and high quality food.
We ordered the steamed spring rolls, chicken pad Thai and unsweetened ice tea. The ice tea was better than some Starbucks teas. It was a fresh blend with a hint of Jasmine. A nice compliment to our meal."}
{"text":"We go for lunch at least once a week.  They have a very good soup that is served prior to all meals.  Service is great."}
{"text":"A. MAZ. ING.  so yummy.  Both of us had seafood dishes.  Very generous portions.  I had red Thai curry-house special.  I had #1 spicy.  Yum.  Hubby had the Royal Thai dinner w green curry.  It came spicy so be sure to say if you want less spicy.  Staff is super friendly and on point.  Will be back."}
{"text":"SO FRESH! Excellent food and tremendous service. I highly recommend. We had pad Thai and yellow curry. Some of the best I've had. :)"}
{"text":"Greatest Thai in the area, recommend the green curry, duck all prepared to perfection with enormous flavors, the freshest herbs and quality. Service is on point, quick and attentive without being overbearing. If you love Thai, you will love Thai House"}
{"text":"The first time I ate here to the latest the food is always on point, good service, nice atmosphere. Enjoying sampling the menu."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch on a Tuesday. Place was quiet, clean & nicely decorated. Our server was prompt and efficient but not exactly friendly. 

The soup starter served with the lunch special tasted like canned chicken broth with frozen peas & carrots and two tofu cubes. Def not made in-house. 

The red curry was super salty and had an odd smokey flavor I've never encountered before. Even more odd, it didn't taste like curry. On the plus side, the level of heat was good - not too mild or hot. 

The Thai Sweet & Sour was more like a Chinese stir fry. It was tempura chicken fried with some ordinary, undercooked veggies (carrots, onions, bell peppers, tomatoes) and then covered in sweet & sour sauce. 

Another server came by towards the end of our meal and refilled my glass with water which would have been great if I hadn't been drinking ginger ale. 

I got the impression that this restaurant buys a lot of prepared and/or frozen foods from restaurant supply stores and then tweaks it for their menu. 

The food was ok, but I'm disappointed we didn't get any Thai food at Thai House."}
{"text":"We go to the university location all the time so we are familiar with their offerings.  I think that the good was not up to the same standard as the university location."}
{"text":"At one point when I first moved to Charlotte I was eating here about once a week. Pad Thai and Pad Krawpaw are flavorful and delicious. If you're not in to spicy food, make sure you tell them \"no\" or \"lite\" spice. \"Medium\" spice can be a little heavy handed, so make sure to specify on anything you order.

The soup they serve during brunch hours is also amazing. It's a plain palette cleansing soup, but I love it."}
{"text":"Fantastic meal. Kind service. Thai style pad thai & chicken curry were fabulous. Also, the steamed tofu spring roll if you want apps!"}
{"text":"Food is good, but u must arrive 1.5 hour before the closing time. Kitchen closes at 1 hour before closing time. If its closing time you HAVE to leave. Else host will stair at u and ask you to eat fast!"}
{"text":"Came here because in the mood for Thai and visiting the area.  We had to wait at the entrance to be sat down, it felt a bit long.  Then got the booth closest to bar.  ... brb"}
{"text":"My mother and I wanted to talk and have a nice dinner for once away from family and we ordered one dish as we were not as hungry. Now I will say I'm frugal when it comes to spending - Though I usually leave a 20-30% tip anywhere I go. We ordered, but the chicken and vegetarian options were the same price. Since I like chicken, and my mother is vegetarian I asked if they can do the Chicken on the side, he said \"no problem.\" 

We get our dish with Chicken inside. -_- We tell the waitress and she fixes it.... We had our doubts that they just picked the chicken out and gave it back.... Which they did. 

At the end I went to pay - (with still a 23% tip). I told the man the experience I had and he replied with \"People usually get two dishes when they don't want Chicken.\" I replied: \"I had asked if he could do Chicken on the side.... You should have said no.\" He again replies with an irritating answer: \"No one's ever asked before so I didn't know.\" Again I reply with \"You should have said no. I could have lived without the chicken and your attitude.\" 

I regret giving them a tip. Their food is SO NOT worth the prices they're charging. I've been to much better Thai places than this who have reasonable prices for the same quality of food and better service. 

I go to the gym almost everyday right next door and I will not be going to Thai house anymore."}
{"text":"Great quality Thai food with natural flavor. No MSG. Very good service.  The location is a bit hidden in a closed Bi-Lo strip mall."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for lunch and enjoyed a delicious meal. Very clean,  complimentary soup, good lunch menu although short. I had the pad Thai and it was superb. The presentation was exceptional and I appreciated that they put my bean sprouts on the side without request.  That way they are crispy and not soggy. The chicken was perfect size and not greasy. And lunch came with a spring roll too (also fantastic). The spice was perfect,  not just red pepper flaked everywhere. Love it! I will be taking the wife here for dinner."}
{"text":"Amazing food, service, and ambiance! Best Thai food ever! The iced tea has steeped jasmine in it, delicious if you're into trying something new! We ordered Red Curry, Larb Salad, Cucumber Salad, Pot Stickers, Fried Spring Rolls, and Mango Sticky Rice and they were seriously all five stars!!! New favorite Thai in the area- oh and all fresh house made ingredients with white meat chicken!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant. My fiance and I decided to try and it was amazing. We've lived here 3 weeks and have already been here 4 times. My favorites are the Pad See-see and the Green fury with brown rice. My fiance has tried 4 different meals and loved them all. The staff is very friendly also!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Service is friendly, food is fresh, they get you in and out quickly. It's good solid Thai food, not gourmet but very good."}
{"text":"My wife and I frequented the Thai House in Charlotte when we lived there. We finally tried the Thai House here in Cornelius and we're pleasantly surprised as to the excellent food and service. The seafood dishes were excellent!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch just over a week ago on my 30 minute lunch.  Over all, the experience was just okay. I got a table straight away and the speed of service was good.  The waiter remembered my lemon for my water (a plus) and the soup that came with their lunch service was good.  It actually was better than a lot of other restaurants as it wasn't just broth with a random carrot or two floating in it.  I selected cashew chicken for my entrée.  Definitely sweeter than it should be and absolutely no heat and minimal spice.  It had some components of traditional Thai cashew chicken dishes I have eaten, but it was more akin to Chinese food than Thai food flavor wise.  On a positive note, the do offer 10% off your first order if you download their app.  They almost always have a Groupon available as well, but it is for dinner only.  I so wanted to L-O-V-E this place as it is right near my job, but alas the hunt continues for great Thai food in Cornelius."}
{"text":"Wonderfully prompt and friendly service, excellent food, and a chill ambience.  I hands down definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"It was good. I don't know if I would say great but it was good, plus it was local. We usually go up to Thai Thai cafe in Mooresville but wanted to try this new place.  It was a little pricey but the food was tasty. The best in Cornelius to be sure"}
{"text":"Stopped here with my family while traveling over the holidays. We were pleasantly surprised. The food was absolutely delicious - from the soup to the pad Thai to my Thai tea. The pad Thai had that wonderful smokey flavor with the perfect amount of tanginess. We highly recommend."}
{"text":"Best thai food in town! Ive had several great tofu options! Make sure you get thai hot! Pad prik king"}
{"text":"So far it's only been to-go food from Thai House but I have to say that all's well with every order.  The two mainstays have been Pad Thai, either shrimp or chicken along with Red Curry beef.  The rest has been some appetizer experimentation with Tod Mun and Golden Shrimp.  

All of it has been good although the Tod Mun had some flavors that were not my faves but it's definitely one of those, \"It's not you it's me\" deals as there are some Thai tastes that don't sit well with my palate.

Online ordering and the spice levels have been on point.  When I've picked up the to-go, the dinning room looks cozy and I'm willing to bet the service is good based on how the take out has gone at the bar.

All in all a nice Thai food option in LKN."}
