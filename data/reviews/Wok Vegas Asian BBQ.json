{"text":"Food was not worth the price.   Overcooked brisket that was too tough to chew.  No beverage unless from a bottle.  Employee stated fountain service broken and she had to manually add ice.  No idea what that meant.   Restaurant itself needs cleaning.   Recommend you don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"Horrible.  DONT GO.  Wouldn't serve water.  Even when asked and shown the law, that it's required to serve water if you serve alcoholic beverages.  Mary, the front lady \"she just works there\", and isn't required to know or follow the laws.  She was however able to bait and switch the sides on us.  Like the other reviews mentioned."}
{"text":"I was staying here at the Stratosphere and went to the \"retail\" floor to try to find something good to eat. After walking a while I stumbled upon this place and since it was rather HIGH priced I reasoned that the food must be of high taste and quality . I was wrong ! Once I received my \"to go\" food I walked back to my hotel room and opened up the box . Completely repulsive . All that was in my plate was some mushed up beef (I ordered Mongolian beef) with some half cooked vegetables piled on top of some bland steamed rice . Seriously , I can't vouch for the rest of the food but the Mongolian beef was disgusting. I didn't even get to finish my meal . $14.02 gone to waste. You can probably get better tasting food at the McDonald's further down this lane."}
{"text":"My family and I ate here tonight. It was $12.95 each for two orange chicken meals. I have paid $7 bucks for an Asain meal and received more and was better quality food. There was about 10 pieces of chicken, and a plate full of bell peppers and onions. Very disappointing. Once we but into it, the rice was watery, overcooked and underseasoned. The chicken was chewy. The dish was overall extremely underwhelming. Save your money and eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Stay away!!! I ordered 2 entrees and a side of steamed veggies; and this is the result. Apparently, they add the side to the entrees and then charge $34. If you're walking by ....just keep walking"}
{"text":"This place is very dirty. Workers there are very rude. I DONOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE.  I order $100 worth of food. One of workers there were giving me attitude. I don't understand what that lady was even saying.  Food was freaking gross. It was dry and some of them were uncooked. I REALLY DONOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE. Horrible horrible place."}
{"text":"no good   no  good  bad  bad  bad  $17.20total       just Five small pieces of chicken is  $12.99  noodles is $4  too  small   nogood"}
{"text":"This place RwOks!!! 3 for 3, best Mongolian Beef in town! Piping Hot! Can't beat it. Great place to grab a bite to eat in between comedy show, Wok Vegas is right next to LA Comedy Club on the mezzanine level of the Stratosphere casino on Las Vegas Blvd."}
{"text":"Worst teppanyaki ever.  Tried the chicken and shrimp and per the menu is is chicken breast and shrimp grilled to perfection. Comes with seasoned veggies.  I paid $24 for this combo and chicken breast was Thigh meat, the shrimp was heavily salted and peppered and not even cooked. The veggies were soaked into vinegar not lemon. Was seriously disgusting.  When I asked to have remade with chicken breast and no vinegar on my veggies the lady at the counter got upset. They tried to tell me they do not have chicken thighs and used lemon. They kept telling me I was incorrect. They took the box back and said they would remake, them I was told they only have chicken thigh left no breast.  I asked for a refund and that was a process. I would not recommend anyone eat there and pay their extremely high price for such poor and not even fresh food."}
{"text":"A little on the pricey side but its Vegas and everything is a little more pricey, other than that its really good coming through for those drunk munchies ;) took a little while though like 15 minutes with no one in front of us but it does taste fresh so that's a plus."}
{"text":"Worst Asian restaurant I ever been too. Too expensive for its taste and quantity. I always stay at Stratosphere but I would never ever go to this place. Not recommended to anyone..!!"}
{"text":"Who ever heard of tough brisket. I ordered a brisket platter as opposed to a brisket sandwich, and it actually came on a slice of white bread. With some crappy over cooked corn on the cob. The brisket was actually tough and slathered with way too much barbecue sauce. It's literally the worst barbecue I've ever had. Never come here and discourage anyone from coming here that's out in front."}
{"text":"I walked by this place and decided to come back and give it a try. Now, I can't speak for the Asian cuisine here but I can attest to how good the BBQ is. A friend and I both got the rib and chicken meal with waffle fries. That was some of the best damn ribs I've had in a LOOONNGG time! I don't know what kind of voodoo magic they put in that pot, but the ribs fell off the bone with ease. As far as the chicken goes, I don't know about everyone else, but I like mine a bit crispy almost burnt around the edges to get that good smoke flavor and that's exactly how they do it. Chicken is chicken so I preferred the dark meat since it doesn't dry out like the breast, but oh man it was still good. The waffle fries weren't too special, just like any other, but my mouth is still watering from those ribs!"}
{"text":"Can't decide if you want Asian or barbecue?  This is a good place for you!  They have a nice assortment of appetizers and sides for both the Asian and barbecue parts of the menu, and the same for the entrees.  They also have a nice selection of beers and the Las Vegas staple of the frozen cocktail drinks.  Prices are reasonable, but if you are looking cheap eats, you're in the Strip, you're in the wrong place!"}
{"text":"Chicken teriyaki came with rice period it was very rated high price but what do you expect for the stratosphere. Not a lot of food options is one of the good ones."}
{"text":"This is the greatest Asian restaurant I've ever eaten in. Great service, nice people and fair pricing. When in Vegas make sure you Wok Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"Interesting to see mixed reviews on this place. The noodles are what set this restaurant apart and the food is delicious! If you are here it's a must try.  As for the price...what do you expect? You're in one of the casinos and it's reasonable fast food."}
{"text":"Good alternative for food without leaving the hotel. My husband and I were hungry and he heard great things about their ribs, so we tried them out.  Located on the 2nd floor (retail level) walking around the floor to the other side near the theater, is Wok Vegas Asian BBQ.  We arrived to an almost empty restaurant/food court. The cashier was happy and eager to take our order. My husband ordered half a rack of ribs and I, shrimp stir fry. Our orders took maybe 10 minutes to make. Piping hot we received our orders.  Overall, my husband enjoyed his meal. I was surprised, because he is a picky eater and is really hard to please. He really enjoyed his meal. I, also enjoyed my meal. The vegetables were fresh and not covered in any think heavy sauce. Enjoyable!   Our only complaint was the diner not having trash cans to throw our plates away. I didn't feel right leaving our trash on the counter, but there was no other place to put them. ."}
{"text":"The color of the rice was off never seen it. It taste terrible couldn't eat it. The teriyaki chicken was so so sweet and hard. I paid $14.00 for some horrible food."}
{"text":"So all this time we've been waiting for the new food choice to open. First they say it'll open the end of 2015, then spring on 2016, then the first of June, and finally the end of June. All that waiting for that? Wow.  So it might look like a 50's diner, minus the roller skates and the annoying out of range singers, more than a Asian style BBQ. Everything is new and shiny, so no cuckorachas or giant rats like in Chinatown in New York.  But let's get to the food. You're going to serve up everything like panda express with the same veggies for most of the dishes (peppers and onions). The first thing I ordered a couple weeks ago was broccoli and beef, not Chinese broccoli, but the not in season broccoli probably from south of the boarder or somewhere in southern California grown broccoli. And being Asian, the RICE for Buddha sake, was Al dente! No, rice is supposed to be floral and fluffy, not hard. A week later, cause you know, I gave this place another chance, I ordered the orange chicken, which was superb in flavor and lightly coated, but this time I ordered chow me in. Again, the chow me in was hard, like the dry noodles at china town in plastic bags, dumped on the flat top grill and tossed with a dash of soy sauce, onion and bell peppers. So today, 6/9/16, I was hungry, well like always. I decided to try something new, but something familiar, Teriyaki chicken. I could hear the clinking and clanking of the metal spatula hitting the flat grill, my mouth watering, thinking yea, I paid about $12 after my discount, that I'll get a nice size portion, and you guessed it, 1.5 cups of chewy rice and what looked about 2 pieces of thigh meat cut into slices. With that price I could have went across the street to the $5 caf√© in the Aztec and bought a hefty portion of pad Thai and a soda and still had money left over to leave tip.  So since this place has smaller portions, expensive on price, even after the discounts, and no more BBQ, which we've all been anticipating for months, which they don't have anymore, correction, which they never had in the first place, I really don't think I'd be going back anymore.  Yeah, there's Asians-working, BBQ Americanized-brisket, like are you eff'n me, $10 for a sandwich on regular bread, not even a hoagie roll, or focaccia bread, or a rice bun, that doesn't include a side, nor a drink. Like the Italians in New York say when they've had enough of the bull shit, \"Gid Outta he!\" It's sad that we have plenty Asians who walk by the retail area and they don't even step in and eat!"}
{"text":"Totally get the low stars for this place.  While walking by, our daughter decided she wanted some egg rolls.  She was told it would take 6 minutes for them to cook so we sat down to wait.  After about 15 minutes, we went back up to see what was taking so long.  We got an apology and a free drink for waiting.  When the eggrolls finally came out, they were still cold inside.  Really? 20 minutes to fry up some eggrolls and they're still cold? It's really unfortunate because the actual flavor was spot on.  Looks like they really need to work on customer service..."}
{"text":"Food was not worth the price. Overcooked brisket that was too tough to chew. We had to wait over 25 minutes for the food to cook... Dear lord.... The Asian food is so salty and chewy noodles.... Not a fan..."}
{"text":"AMAZING! Great food, so cool that everything is made fresh. Definitely coming back here again!"}
{"text":"Food is not good! Don't waste your appetite. To be fair, we didn't try the Asian cuisine, but the BBQ was definitely not good."}
{"text":"So good. Fresh ingredients. Love it! Definitely will be back for more, like later tonight."}
{"text":"This place was incredible! Not only was the food amazing and tasty, the staff was super nice and helpful! I think the owner was there when I went, and he was so friendly and made sure that we had everything we needed. The choices were full of nummy num nums for your tummy tum tum, trust me! The menu was innovate and different, and I ordered the orange chicken. It was full of flavor an tasty goodness! The rice was fluffy and perfect. If you are looking for a quick tasty bite for a super great price, definitely check this place out! NOMS!!!!"}
{"text":"I wish i could leave 0 stars, unfortunately I can't. I went to the Wok on Wednesday June 20th, at 300pm. Whomever the worker was that day and time was THE rudest employee I've EVER encountered. I was honestly thrown off of how rude she was. I'm honestly still in shock. i grabbed a menu- walked away (about 10-15 feet away) to let them know i wasn't ready and need time. The lady YELLED \"WHAT WOULD YOU LIIKE\" I--- i stated i wasn't ready... then when I was ready, I headed over to the counter to order orange chicken, rudely, again, she said \"We don't have any.\" , moved on to order something else, after my order the lady said something, I didn't hear her due to the fact she was mumbling at this point, while looking down. I said, I'm sorry i didn't hear you. She literally screamed, and when i say screamed I mean screamed.... \"NAME\" straight in my face. It's not appropriate to talk to any guest like that as a worker, bad day or not. It's not Okay. I was extremely offended and SUPER upset. I told her she was so rude & i won't be ordering from this place anymore and walked off. Worse customer service I've EVER had. EVER. Never again will I mention this place to a soul or even walk by it."}
