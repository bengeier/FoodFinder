{"text":"Drinks are fabulous. Try the hand-shaken lemonade. Paella is the best I've had in Cleveland. (Though I have to admit I haven't had that much paella in Cleveland.) Hummous is ok, not awesome. Why I ordered this red herring of an item on the menu, I don't know. It's a bit of blandness in a sea of spice fusion. Guess I felt the need to go healthy. Black beans on top of rice are heavy on the pepper. Not my taste, but if you like getting smacked in the nose with black and chili pepper aroma in the steam, go for it. Great location. Wonderful outdoor patio!  A common thread runs through most of the selections, though I couldn't pinpoint it to one ingredient. As the talking heads on FoodTV would say, this place \"has a clear culinary point of view.\" Something Spanish with a little Mediterranean and a twist of Cleveland catering to a diverse university crowd. Except for the hummous and beans, everything I've ever had here has been a good balance of salt, sweet, and tang. Delish!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant in the case university area. Our fish was perfectly done. Service wa very good, but not perfect. Prices were pretty reasonable. Very enjoyable."}
{"text":"I've had many wonderful meals here. They specialize in Brazilian fare, and I think that's where the menu really shines. But if you aren't familiar with the cuisine, you might not notice. It's just great food.   For a stellar mixed drink, try the capirania. It hasn't tasted this good since I was on a beach in Costa Rica.  It seems like most of the restaurant seating is outside. So it's great for a nice summer evening. But if the weather gets bad, then the inside can get very crowded very quick."}
{"text":"njon recommended this place to us, and we loved it!  we sat outside in their cozy, sunny patio, and tried a bunch of their small plates, which were not only delicious, but very well-priced (3 for $18!  i could barely believe it!)  there were a couple small spots in the service, but overall, I loved the place, and would love to return.  thanks njon... for telling me!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food, I enjoy the servers. However, I am frustrated that both sergios and sarava refuse to serve my girlfriend because of a nut allergy. If a restaurant is at the caliber of both of these and as expensive, there should be no reason why they cannot guarantee her safety. This is something i sincerely hope gets changed. For this reason, I come in a lot less than I would since I cannot bring her. If L'albatros can serve her, Sergio's should be able to.."}
{"text":"This is a must-go every time we visit Cleveland. This is my mom's favorite restaurant in Cleveland and she still talks about the food on a weekly basis.  The steak is deliciously tender and the sides are so wonderful and unique.  Great location!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has closed permanently as of March 19, 2013."}
{"text":"Love this little gem in university circle. If you're around the area on weekdays, it's a wonderful place to stop in and grab a delicious lunch. If it's a nice day, the patio seating is great.  In the evenings you will definitely need reservations (maybe for lunch, too). It is a really small, intimate restaurant. I counted once, and though I don't remember the exact number, I believe there were less than 40 seats in the whole place, so it fills up quickly. But trust me, it's so worth it. With so few seats, the service is outstanding. It's a very open, attractive restaurant, too.  Now for the food. The cuisine is more Mediterranean at Sergio's, unlike Sarava which has a much heavier Brazilian influence. Everything I've had there has been really good, but a few of my favorites would have to be the Orichette pasta, which comes in a delicious creamy sauce (not really alfredo, but along those lines) with grilled chicken and these tiny little fried onion shavings. The flavors mix wonderfully. They have several great desserts. My favorite is the Coconut Butter Cake, but you can't go wrong with the dense chocolate torte, or really any of their dessert menu.  Strongly recommend stopping here after a visit to the museums or on your way to an Orchestra concert. The prices are much more reasonable than the Severance Hall restaurant, and the atmosphere is so pleasant and intimate. I definitely prefer this over the larger Sarava sister restaurant."}
{"text":"I came here once for dessert, so as far as food quality is concerned, i've only taken the dessert into consideration.  ambiance is really nice, way better than most restaurants i've been to in the non-downtown cleveland area. i also couldn't help but notice that the music there has always been good (you can hear it while walking by, not just going inside). no smooth jazz folks!  dessert is my 2nd to favorite meal, and i'd say it was good here, but i've had better. pretty simple and yummy... but then again, how can you go wrong with a white cake or flan (aka in sergio's lingo, \"coconut butter cake and brazilian caramel custard\") for what it costs i allowed myself higher expectations, but i'd give it another shot to try the lunch/dinner next time."}
{"text":"Food was pretty great!!  Vegetarian plate was quite flavorful and interesting.  Our server was about 14 years old, and could use a little more orientation/training, but overall it was a quaint, comfy place to have a nice romantic meal.  Wine list great, interesting and diverse beer selection--even a fantastic organic ale!!   Outdoor seating patio would be nice too!  It can get a little loud if you get a drunk party (like we had)...perhaps they could hang some rugs on the wall to damper the reverberations..  hehe"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on a Thursday night and the food was great.  I'd give it a 5 star except my main entree (the scallops) were a bit too salty for my taste, though they were cooked very well.  Appetizers of mussels and calamari were fantastic, where the calamari was some of the best I've ever had (just right balance of breading to meat).  Flourless Chocolate Cake dessert was also spot on - I think Sergio's is one of the only restaurants I've eaten in Cleevland that has this, so definitely try this dessert if you like chocolate.  Service was fantastic, and ambiance was nice too - not too loud so you can have a conversation but not so quiet that it's weird."}
{"text":"This restaurant is next door to the Glidden House hotel and provides room service for the hotel.  I had the steak which was awesome.  Fast service, too!"}
{"text":"Everything was prepared very well, but the food was lacking anything special to really put it over the top. I also didn t like sitting so close to the next table. The outside patio looked lovely and we may be back in warmer weather to give this place another try.  Ordered the goat cheese app (love that they use chevre frm lake erie creamery), pollo romano and hanger steak."}
{"text":"Sergio's is the best restaurant Shatangi ever worked in.  Sergio is truly a visionary and he and his family have invested much into the excellent level of service and quality and presentation of the food.  Awesome wine parings as well.  Sergio's proves that there's more to Brazi food than feijoada.  Shatangi told you"}
{"text":"Went there for Valentine's Day which didnt live up to the hype I decided to build in my head after lusting after it from across the street all year.  Also bear in mind... This was a set v-day menu.  Service was good. Glazed duck was good. But the apps were the crapps.  I am keeping this short because the menu wasnt reflective of the regular options I hope. I just am expecting more for next time with tapas.   But v-day was way far too subpar for such a wonderfully intimate space."}
{"text":"Since I had takeout from Sergio's, I'm going to rate them on food alone.  - Eggplant crisps: comes with lemon thyme dipping sauce; would be delicious had they not been made completely soaked with frying oil (I used a thick napkin to soak all the excess oil out); the eggplant is thinly sliced, heavily battered, and crisp otherwise - Beef tenderloin romana: the \"steak\" medallions were subpar; pasta was way past al dente; flavor of the san marzano tomatoes was mediocre at best (there was no tangy \"pop\")  I'm not from Cleveland, but if you want some more fresh/flavorful Italian food, I would look somewhere else."}
{"text":"Lackluster.  The service was beautiful (I was also well taken care of).  The food was a little pricey, which you expect for quality food, but I wasn't wow-ed.  The seating is a little tight, which added to the awkwardness of facing a couple sitting next to each other as I dined alone.  I'm pretty sure they called their coconut cake some kind of famous.  I would rather call it \"meh\".  You won't be impressed, and you won't be unhappy.  I'm not a Chinese diver, so I like my meal to invoke a little emotion."}
{"text":"I used to give out 5 stars more easily than I do now. If I had written this review last year it would have gotten 5 easily.  So for me to give it 5 now means something. Oh well. Now before I review the restaurant I will give a mini review on how easy it has become to make reservations using Open Table. This has got to be one of the 5 best innovations in restaurant history. I was able to get reservations for two on a Saturday evening on a night the Orchestra was playing. I made these reservations at noon the same day. WOW!   My date and I arrived a little early and were seated right away by one of the nicest hostesses ever. Our water glasses were filled withing one minute of being seated. Bread and menus came immediately after that. This is a restaurant staff that works as a team. I hate hate hate going to a restaurant where everything is somebody elses job. At Sergios everybody does everything, and everybody notices everything. Your water glass is never empty (something only this place and The Velvet Tango Room seem to get) and empty plates and used silverware are removed and replaced by whoever is closest to you when the need arises. Our server (besides being cute as a button) was always there when you needed her to be, but never hovered over us or intruded in our conversation. I can't say enough about the service. I am getting to the food and drink, I swear, but one more thing. Even the valet was amazing. These guys had you out of your car and into the restaurant in seconds despite having to maneuver a bunch of cars in the smallest space ever. Plus, they will let you leave your car there after dinner if you want. This is something they offer without even being asked.   We ordered a bottle of French Wine that I am going to get the name of because it was delicious. The wine list isn't the most extensive, but if they were all as good as this one then they don't have to be. We ordered the mussels as an appetizer and they were fabulous.  Fresh and tender and served with toasted garlic bread to soak up the broth.  And soak we did.  There was not a drop left. We both ordered the scallops which is, in my opinion the easiest menu item to screw up in the history of screwing up menu items. They are almost always either raw in the middle or cooked into rubber.  But when they are done right they are heaven on a dish.  These were some the best I have ever had.  Sweet and tender.  Little pillows of perfection.  The desert custard was a perfect end to a nearly flawless meal.  I really don't have a bad thing to say about Sergios.  It's a tad small and you have to basically climb a ladder to get to the bathroom, but other than that.....one of the best restaurant experiences I have ever had."}
{"text":"I had an early lunch with my good friend here several weeks ago. We both work in Univeristy Circle, and it was a really ideal meeting place. The parking is sufficient, and the staff is attentive. The seating is TIGHT... so close that you are nearly touching your dining neighbors. I definitely subtracted a star for that. We both got the BELT burger. Its HUGE, juicy, and perfectly done. In fact, I could barely eat half of my burger! I enjoyed lunch here and would definitely go back."}
