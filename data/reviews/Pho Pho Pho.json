{"text":"Got the pho, soup base was great...Not too salty, oily and not loaded with MSG. Cuts of meat were tender and really good. Would go back to this place again."}
{"text":"Excellent pho, very good broth. Place is relatively clean for pho restaurants in the GTA.  Service is good for a pho restaurant.  An excellent bowl of pho for a great price. I come here 2-3 times a week."}
{"text":"Very enjoyable dinner. As noted elsewhere this is the cleanest pho restaurant I have ever been to. I had the spring rolls with shrimp and rare beef pho. Both were fantastic and very flavorful. Service was good as a nice old gentleman took care of several tables. Priced right and well worth a visit. It wasn't very crowded as there was a mix of regulars and probably tourists on the way  to the airport."}
{"text":"Great value at a small family owned operation.  Visited it for the first time with a friend who is a regular and given my history with PHO (see review on Golden Turtle at Ossington) I decided to only try out the curry rice which was great.  The decor leaves a lot to be desired for but that isn't their strong point.  Price is definitely what they are selling you on.  And the staff seems family run and has a long memory...my friend had not visited in months and they still remembered and acknowledged him!   First time visit with a non-Pho dish was ok...I may swallow my dignity and try Pho next time to tell you all about...."}
{"text":"What a gem!! I stopped in for a quick dinner before meeting a friend in the area. As soon as I opened the door, I was greeted with the smells of delicious food. A great sign. A restaurant that smells great, usually IS great. A restaurant that smells like cleaning products... run.   I was really craving bun bo hue, but they didn't have that on the menu so I went with grilled chicken and spring rolls on vermicelli. As I waited for my meal, other patrons started coming in... a couple of men who just finished a construction-type job, a young family, a small group of friends. The owner seemed to know them all and joked with them as they entered. Another good sign.   The food came and it was exactly what I wanted (well, the second thing I wanted). The chicken was hot and tender, the spring rolls were crispy, and I would have drank the nuoc cham if they sold it in a can.   I can't remember what the cost was, but it was a very good price.   I will DEFINITELY return next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Love this place. Mainly because the staff is friendly, a rare quality in Asian restaurants. Pho is good. I usually have rare and well done beef. I have tried rice with pork and chicken. The meat is flavor full.  Missing one star cause decor is basic and bathroom is not so good."}
{"text":"Best pho I've had.  Maybe Im biased based on the great service, but really, I love their pho.  The owners are super friendly and have long term elephant-like memories.  I came here with my dad after a very long stint away, and they remembered me still!  They are so friendly, they don't mind giving you more soup for free.  Problem is, they don't bother staying open for dinner hours, which I guess makes sense since its located in the middle of nowhere.  I definitely want to go back!  Based on the stellar review, you may wonder why I only gave it four stars, well, the washroom is blah and the venue is also bleh."}
{"text":"I tried to pho noodles special here where it has a bit of different meats.  I find the place to be satisfactory.  I was looking for soup noodles on a freezing day and this hit the spot.     I won't consider this to be one of the best places for pho but it does satisfy a craving.  The broth was descent and the noodles was tender."}
{"text":"Awesome if you are north of the 401 and Dixie area. Only pho place around but they are amazing and friendly! Home style pho and FeiJaiApproved!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best pho places I've been to! Very favorable soup with a reasonable price tag - definitely would come again!"}
{"text":"Oh where to start? This is only my second time here today, but inside a week. I will be forever grateful to a colleague of mine who brought me here the first time.  The place is amazing!!!! The food is simply out of this world and the service is super prompt and friendly.  I eat more pho than many, but out of all I have ever had, this place is in the top 3, if not the very best!!  For my second time today, I have had their P18 special pho pho pho and the flavors, noodle to broth and meat to broth ratio is phenomenal. The serving in the Large bowl is probably more than most people can eat. Not me tho...I am a professional pho eater! :) I can do the large, even tho only barely. The broth is not too salty, which often is the case in other restaurants i have been.  Literally,  the only disappointing moment of every meal here is, when you can see the bottom of the bowl or plate, because that is about the same time when you're nearly finished this meal of outstanding flavors. This feeling of disappointment is quickly lost again to to comfort of knowing that it doesn't matter if you come back here tomorrow, next week or next month, this place will be there and the quality of the food be the same every time!!   I can only recommend this place to anyone, even if it means you have to travel in to enjoy it, the trip is well worth it!!  Well done pho pho pho....I'll be a friend of this establishment for a very long time...pho sho!! :)"}
{"text":"I come here semi-frequently.  It's the closest Pho place to my work.  it's ok - the warm soup is amazing on a colder day.  The staff here are really nice and service is great!"}
{"text":"Clean and fresh pho place   Large portions, cheap, and accommodating to changes.   I had a veggie pho, and they substituted the beef broth with just water for me."}
{"text":"Great food!  Great service....In and Out in no time even during busy lunch period."}
{"text":"Fast and fresh food, friendly service.  Find a seat, browse the menu, write your order on the slip of paper, hand it to the staff, look out the window, your meal appears, eat, pay at the counter, leave.  Pho is priced at $5/6/7 for S/M/L with a tasty broth and fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Like other has mention this place is located in a industrial area.  I ordered their special Pho because it gives me the chance to try everything especially the broth. If you can't make your special Pho bowl really good. You don't deserve to be open.   Taste was OK. I could taste the MSG from my first sip of the broth. Portions are smaller than what I am used to and I ordered a large bowl too.  Service is slow but knowing this place run by 2-3 people probably the owners. But the old lady had a sweet smile.  Overall not bad and considering the location is almost a middle of nowhere."}
{"text":"This place is great  Good noodle to broth ratio  Bad hours though   They close at 7 which sucks I'm surprised a pho place that closes before 9."}
{"text":"I read the reviews here and all I have to say is this place is very dirty! Beware! Have a look at behind the cash, into the kitchen when the doors swing open.  If you can't keep your kitchen clean what does that tell me? It tells me to stay away."}
{"text":"food 4/5 - nice bur regular Pho. solid  Service 4/5 - friendly, a bit empty space but accommodating.   Location 4/5 - near Hwy and main road. free parking  Price 4/5 - $20+ for lunch w/ beer.   Will be back.!"}
{"text":"I have tried pho in different parts of the city and I am glad to find this place tucked away between Brampton and the airport.  The portions are a good size taste and quality on par with others... it is a cafeteria style setting but it is not the decor that you are after, it's the tasty food..  I had the special Pho bowl and I could taste how fresh the beef was... and the soup was clear and tasty not too salty..   I also Tried a jack Fruit drink which was a good complement to the savory meal.."}
{"text":"The BEST pho I have ever had hands down. Staff was so friendly ! Can't wait to go back!!"}
