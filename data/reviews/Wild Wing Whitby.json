{"text":"If I could give a negative star I would. The service was crap!! We were the only group in the place an they couldn't get out food out. It took over 40 mins to get our orders. Don't come here when all the pregnant waitresses are working because they suck. The food was good but the service is shit."}
{"text":"Had a great time as always! I Had a double with poutine and they were superb. Love the classic wings here. My kids had a great time here as well. Also the fact they have Dr Pepper on tap! Server was great and fast."}
{"text":"Absolutely shit service, the place was DEAD and it took 50 mins for deep fried boneless wings and fries. Then we ask for it for take out where the server look 10 mins to put our as take away. I will never eat here again"}
{"text":"BIG tasty wings! A LB of wings will fill you up! There are iPads at every table and their WIFI doesn't suck! Ordered HOT wings and complained it wasn't hot enough - they brought me this \"Suicide Sauce\" that was EXACTLY what I wanted! The GAR-PAR fries are worth a try! Service was fast!"}
{"text":"Hmm...it was bad at all for us. I read the reviews and was skeptical but our experience was ok.  Food: 3.5/5, the nachos were delicious. The wings were ok. We got mystery, smoked thai, sweet escape and Chiquita something.  The sweet escape which was garlic Parmesan with honey garlic was the best.  The mystery dry rub was disappointing.  The spiciness of Chiquita was there but it had an off sour taste.    Service: 2/5, meh, it was hard to get a hold of the waitress  Ambience: 4/5, great seating and music.  Price: 3/5, about $20 per person which can be a tad high for a wing joint."}
{"text":"Fun place to go for chicken wings.  Wings are good, about 100 flavors to choose from.  The Oshawa location is bigger than the one in Whitby.  Be sure to try the GarPar wings."}
{"text":"Without a doubt the worst service in Durham. Sitting at the bar for them to \"clear our table\" as they proceeded to seat 3 other parties after we had arrived. The service never improved through the evening. Ne'er would I even think of going back."}
