{"text":"Several months ago, I joined a website called LunchClub.Net. Monday through Friday they send you emails offering discounts at local restaurants. Usually the discount is 15 - 20% or 2 for 1 entree. It's been pretty cool thing. You save money and discover new restaurants. Some are good, some are not so good and one is called Le Peep.

Le Peep is one of those unfortunate businesses affected by the current light rail construction. Because of this, you'd think they'd go more out of their way make the experience better. However, you'd be wrong.

The food and service were both pretty mediocre. Not horrible but not great or outstanding. I think the two times I ate there I had unremarkable sandwiches that honestly I don't remember much about. What I do remember is the service. It was slow. Particularly slow considering there were hardly any other customers.

But my favorite part was this. Want to know the secret ingredient of their Veggie Mix Soup?

{"text":"I gave Le Peep 4 stars because they have great smoothies!!  This is one of 2 breakfast places I frequent on the weekends.  They have been going through some tough times lately because of the light rail construction, so busy times are hit-or-miss.  Generally around brunch time on the weekends its not too bad, but every once in a while you will hit them at their busy time.  

Generally I get really good service at Le Peep.  Lately however it has been slow, bad, or not at all.  I used to see the owner there working every time I went in, but haven't seen her in several months, so I don't know if it was sold to someone else or what.  After I stopped seeing her there  is when I started seeing the servers come and go and the service get worse.

I find the breakfast food pretty good, and like I said the smoothies are great.  I have not had anything for lunch there.  I can recommend the french toast or the mini veggie omelet which is awesome!  They have pretty good coffee and their prices are reasonable.  To top it all off, they give you punch cards good toward free meals.  

Le Peep seems to be going through some tough times right now, but I'm sticking with them for my weekend breakfast and I recommend them to anyone in the Central Phoenix area looking for something better than your other choice.....IHOP."}
