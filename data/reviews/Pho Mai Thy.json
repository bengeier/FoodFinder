{"text":"Quite big of a restaurant for a vietnamese place. Price is quite decent when paired with the generous portion. Big menu w lots of choices too. My sate pho was very flavorful but not too spicy, and the grilled meat on vermicelli  was well marinated. Would recommend this place if you want a nice Vietnamese dinner with good ambience and alcohol :)"}
{"text":"Wow, such a great hidden gem. I went here on a Sunday and the food is amazing and seems a bit more authentic than the handful of viet place...and the price is so reasonable! The service was amazing as well, the lady there was such a hard worker! And so friendly. 5/5 totally recommend"}
{"text":"Their Pho is too sweet and salty
 No size options their size.is too small for me. What I really liked there though is their weekend special - shredded pork pork chop the egg cake on rice. Delicious. Again too salty for my taste but that egg cake thing is not easy to find in Calgary Vietnamese restaurants."}
{"text":"Excellent sahty rare beef soup
Not just with chili sauce, more of a brown beef style broth.
Clean and friendly."}
{"text":"As this place opens longer, the food is getting better. Great service and clean. Good food and good prices."}
{"text":"Ordered a Bun Bo Ga Tom. No herbs, no sprouts. Nuoc mam was too sweet like sugar water. Not authentic Vietnamese food at all."}
{"text":"Went here to try their food and I regret coming here. Their banh hoi tasted horrible. The vegetables are not fresh (black edges), meat was tasteless and small. They advertised shrimp and they replaced with Vietnamese sausage. I definitely will not be coming here again."}
{"text":"I was pretty sad to see Saffron Mantra go but was excited at the sight of a new Vietnamese restaurant.  After reviewing the online menu I decided to check the place out with my family last night.  They've done a great job renovating the place - it looks much nicer and less of a bar/pub (whatever it was before Saffron Mantra).  I was happy to see some low carb options and got the grilled beef salad with a side of wings.  My family ordered a variety of rice/noodle dishes with the usual rolls as appetizers and thought everything tasted good but with portions on the smaller side.  I appreciate the large variety of items on their menu and would definitely be back to try more things.

Note: they are doing a 10% off promo until Dec 15 for their grand opening!"}
{"text":"Bad service. Almost pretentious. Food is delicious though, so if you don't mind feeling judged your whole meal I'd say it's worth a visit."}
{"text":"Hubby introduced the family to this restaurant that's tucked away in a strip mall by 64th Ave and Centre Street.  I ordered the deep fried salt and pepper chicken wings and pork spring rolls as appetizers.  The wings were seasoned well and the skin was beautifully crispy.  However, I wished that they could've taken the time to render more of the fat beneath the skin.      
   The spring rolls were amazing--they were served piping hot; a perfect combination of crunch on the outside and juicy pork on the inside. Watch that you don't burn your tongue!  
   Won ton soup with veggies and egg noodles: my son really enjoyed the light, flavourful broth with perfectly steamed veggies and firm noodles.  He was a little disappointed that there was hardly any meat filling in the wontons, though.
   Rare beef slices pho: the beef broth had great depth of flavour and the soup was served at the perfect temperature.  My son was having a good time tasting and comparing the broths in my soup and his.  Strangely enough, the side plate of the usual garnishes for pho, i.e. fresh Thai basil, bean sprouts, limes, never showed up at our table.  Well, it was 2:00pm and maybe the server was a bit tired...
   The prices are reasonable and there's a lot of items to choose from the menu.  I would like to try their banh xeo and banh hoi chau on my next visit!"}
{"text":"This is a new Vietnamese restaurant that just hit the food scene not too long ago. The location is where Saffron Mantra used to be. Let me start with how impressed I am with Pho Mai Thy. The menu is the most extensive I've seen in the area without having to go to International Avenue for similar specialty items such as fish in a clay pot, banh hoi and canh chua. The pho broth is much more flavorful than Pho Thanh on 64th Ave, the ingredients are fresh and the service is quite quick. The servers speak Vietnamese and Chinese. They even do a stamp card system where if you get 10 stamps, your 11th meal is free. This is my new favorite Vietnamese restaurant and in my opinion is the best in the area."}
{"text":"They're (relatively) new, but I couldn't tell, because the service was friendly and efficient. Each time I've gone I tried the lunch special, which includes one of the vermicelli or soup (pho) main dishes plus one shrimp salad roll and a can of pop, all for less than $10. The place is clean, and the high ceiling makes it feel especially spacious--the main dining area is sizable and can accommodate large groups."}
{"text":"We decided to give this place a try because it had a decent vegetarian menu and was close to our house.  We tried the vegetarian spring rolls, a vegetarian vermicelli dish and the vegetarian noodle soup.  All of the dishes were okay, not a place I would go out of my way to go to; Rau Bistro has more flavour which isn't that far away.  I would come here again out of convenience."}
{"text":"Came here with the hubs at around 1pm on a Sunday. Our friends had recommended this place as they are currently running a 10% discount until early December as a \"grand opening special\".

We were promptly greeted at the door by a crowd of other waiting customers, and the cashier. He told us it would be a thirty minute wait for a table for two (there were LOTS of empty tables when we got there... all dirty though). We decided that it would be okay to wait it out, during our wait we could see people (multiple tables) grabbing unused tea cups and cutlery from other tables so that they could eat... apparently the servers forgot to bring any to them prior to serving their food. Eventually a table did get cleared for us within ten minutes so that we could get seated.

The menu here is quite extensive, much more than some of the other pho places in the area. Attempting to place an order after we had decided what we wanted was quite an ordeal. We got the attention of the first server which said he would be right back to take our order, but after 5 minutes had passed, we knew there was no hope in having him take our order. Sadly, I then had to wave and frantically get the attention of the other server. I had originally wanted to get their \"vegetarian special noodle soup hue style\" which the server had stated was available, but after waiting thirty minutes for the food, it turns out that it was not so. 

In the end we settled to get their pork spring rolls, vermicelli with lemongrass chicken and bean sprouts, rice vermicelli - steam with grilled meat combo, and an avocado shake. When the food did arrive, it was FABULOUS! I was provided quite an elaborate set up for my steamed rice vermicelli, and had great fun making little rolls to eat. We did have to remind the servers quite a number of times to bring us tea and the avocado shake we ordered though. The avocado shake could use some work, as it was quite icy, and had very little avocado taste to it at all. The portion sizes for the hot food was great for the price. 

I think that with a little bit more experience, this restaurant could be something great, but at this point in time, the service still has lots to be desired.

Update: I've had a whole lota take out from here recently and it's fab every time! Highly recommend C38 super tasty and great bang for you buck. Loved having their thick noodles as well. Portion size for that was a bit small but it was something you don't typically find at other pho places."}
{"text":"Went on Friday night and had a wonderful meal. The only downside was the wait for the take home boxes and the bill."}
{"text":"This is a decent Vietnamese restaurant that can compete with the busy place a few minutes away.  They have ample space and are pretty quick.  I ordered the sate beef pho and was quite happy to hear they used the peanut sate sauce.

The sate sauce could've used a bit more flavour.  I ended up needing to add hoisin sauce which defeats the purpose of having sate to begin with.  The staff are very friendly and guess what, they understand you and don't rush you (like the other place).

I've been here twice so far and I have only tried their soup dishes.  Each time I was impressed but not wowed.  Their prices are quite reasonable with spending about $10 each time.  I'll definately go back and try some rice dishes; perhaps it will deserve a 4-star rating after trying more things."}
{"text":"Great new addition to the Vietnamese restaurant options in the NW. The restaurant is clean and and has a extensive menu. It has speciality dishes from various parts of Vietnam such as Bun Bo Hue Bun (pork and beef broth) and Banh Xeo (Vietnamese crepe) that are not found all Vietnamese restaurants. 

The prices are on the low end when compared to other viet restaurants in the neighborhood. Especially right now for their grand opening, 10% off! My bun bo hue I ordered was flavourful but in my opinion lacked sufficient meat, only a few pieces. The banh xeo was very crispy and delicious but yet again only had 4 pieces of shrimp for a huge crepe. Overall, great restaurant especially for the price. Happy munching!

Ordered
1. Bun bo hue (flavourful pork and beef broth, lacked meat)
2.. Banh xeo (crispy crepe)
3. Pho sate (very delicious broth and dish)
4. Banh hoi chau (H81) - rice vermacelli with grilled meats (wrap your own kind of salad rolls, very unique dish and not offered everywhere. The meats are unique to Vietnamese cuisine and include fish and beef)"}
{"text":"This Vietnamese restaurant has a much more extensive menu than many I have been to.  The food is well prepared, service is quick and prices are good.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Love it. Price is right , service is tight, and food is delicious and authentic. Gone here lots and love it Everytime."}
{"text":"Ate at Pho Mai Thy for lunch today.  Easy to find.  It's in the same complex as the IDA Pharmacy close to 64 Ave and Centre St NW.  

We were the first to arrive.  We sat in a 1/2 booth and proceeded to look over the menu.  We decided on the following:
- Spring Rolls - nice and piping hot with the fish sauce dipping sauce
- Banh Xeo - Crepe with bean sprouts, ground pork and shrimp - eat with lettuce leaves, Rau ram, mint leaves and slices of cucumber.  Wrap the portion of crepe in your lettuce leaf and then pull off some of the garnishing leaves.  Roll it up and dip in the fish sauce.  Yum!
- Sate Beef Pho - delicious sate soup with a hefty bowl of pho.  Eat with garnishes like mint, cooked bean sprouts and lime.  
- Special Mai Thy Pho - all kinds of goodies in this bowl of pho - quartered beef balls, beef, tripe - Add the garnishes as above.  Delicious soup.  Hearty bowl on a cold day.
- Rare Beef Pho - quite similar to the Special soup except it's got rare beef.

The wait staff was very observant and tended to our needs promptly.

Very good prices and a very big menu of goodies.  Lots of parking spots around the restaurant.

Will definitely be back!"}
