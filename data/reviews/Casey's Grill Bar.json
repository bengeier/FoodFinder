{"text":"Had a 4hr layover and wanted a QUICK bite. I was mistaken...this place is slow and servers really don't want to help you. First off, if you work in the airport, expect tourist!!! Who in their right mind would come here to eat and drink if they are not traveling? I don't even think it's possible to come here if you are local (you will have to get screened by customs to enter the airport). My vent is not about getting a table but really the servers and bartenders. They really don't want to be here to work and serve.  I see them chatting away with others servers, laughing, and eating. WTH!!!  You are suppose to be working so please, please work. I see a lot of customers getting angry cause their food wasn't ready or wanting to leave the damn place but the servers would not give them the check(cause the server(s) were chatting/eating). This was my first time in Toronto and if the people working in the airport are like this, how would you think tourists, like myself, would feeling about entering your city ever again?
P.s. The server ID on my receipt is 2066  hope the manager/owner of the institute find this server and give her a word or two about customer service."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  Server was rude and service was slow even though there were very few customers. I waited for a while at the table then left when no one came to take my order."}
{"text":"The poached eggs were overcooked, the hash was undercooked, my companion's order was incorrect, and the server was suffering from laryngitis or some other condition that left her unable to speak above a whisper.  I'm just hoping I got away with was a seriously unsavory $50 breakfast for 4 and not strep throat."}
{"text":"As far as airport restaurants go, this one really is A-OK. Service was friendly and quick, food wasn't astounding, but it was good and the price wasn't too horrible. I went here to kill some time during a long layover and having been up since 4am, needed more than a muffin from Starbucks. They didn't rush me out and let me sit and have a cup of coffee.  

I went for the Casey's Classic breakfast, which is your standard eggs over easy, bacon, potatoes and toast.  The eggs were a little on the runny side, but not enough that I was bothered. Not a bad spot to eat when you're facing a four hour wait at Pearson and you don't want to sit at your gate."}
{"text":"Had breakfast. Food was cafeteria food on a fancy plate, with a single fresh piece of fruit to make it look nice. Service staff obviously didn't want to be working, it took me 15 minutes to find my server to take my payment when I was done, after 2 managers told me they wouldn't take my payment. It was edible and tasted alright, but I definitely won't bother next time. Especially if you're in a rush, don't even think about it."}
{"text":"The Toronto airport doesn't offer a lot of choices unfortunately. When I got here two friends were waiting and thank goodness one of them shared his food with me or I would have gone hungry - the service was the pits. I did manage to get a Bloody Caesar eventually. My friend's had celery in it, mine didn't. It wasn't very good either. The three chicken wings I ate weren't too bad at least."}
{"text":"When in Canada, you pine for poutine. Stuck in Terminal 1 for a connection, our options were limited. The ability to add pulled pork to our poutine drew us into Casey's. They offer a familiar modern diner feel, with TVs and a bar. Didn't take long for the poutine to arrive, piping hot! Decent portion to share between 2 people. Fries are on the soft side, hardly crisp at all. I have a feeling they smothered them in cheese curds, gravy, onions and pulled pork, then gave the whole thing a spin in the oh-so-fancy microwave. On the plus side, free soda refills."}
{"text":"Really good for food at an airport, but not really good. Part of the Casey's chain with a reduced menu size and inflated airport prices. The food is good, just not special. I imagine that most items are frozen and cooked by short order cooks. The service was friendly and very good. I eat here every time I am in this area of the airport, and will go back again."}
{"text":"I am always finding myself at this Casey's while waiting for a delayed flight as I have all this time to spare and was given a voucher, sometimes its worth $20 and sometimes $30. On the plus side, this is better then airplane food so might as well sit and enjoy all the extra time I was giving.

Service always seem to be slow, I couldn't imagine trying to eat here and have to catch a flight without being delayed that's for sure.

The menu is limited though, has most of the items that any other Casey's carries,  just smaller and easier entrees on the menu.

The food is average, the whole chain is average. I would prefer this to airline food any day. I usually have leftovers for my long flights too!

Also, Casey's is located in Terminal 1, International Departures."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food... Service is consistant and prices are in line with quality of food."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for breakfast on my way out of town. The food was passable, but nothing special. The service was slow in comparison to other airport restaurants that I've eaten in - usually they know that you're going to need to catch a flight and are super speedy. Fortunately I came early enough that their slowness didn't affect catching my plane. 

Service was polite and helpful. Eggs benedict were passable, but no better than standard diner fare."}
{"text":"Despite the less than stellar reviews, gave this a try since I didn't have many other options.  For airport food, not bad at all.

I had the poutine (because why not, in Canada?)  It was pretty good, though not the best I've had.  Service was friendly and fairly efficient.  Prices were only a little high; what do you expect in an airport?  All in all, I was satisfied."}
{"text":"I was catching a flight to Vancouver yesterday and had lunch at Casey's.

The menu is reduced from the other locations, which makes sense.  I ordered chicken fingers and fries.  The coating barely stuck to the chicken, my plum sauce has been dipped over onto my fries and the fries were boring.

My server, Vlad, was very unengaged ... he obviously didn't want to be there.  Not the spot for him to be at a busy airport.  When he was serving the people at the tables on either side of me, his butt hovered over my table/meal.  Ewwww!  He should have instead stood behind them, not between the close tables.

He perked up a bit when it came time to bring me my bill.  Too late, pal.  I tipped him accordingly.

I usually eat at one of the take-out restaurants closer to Gate 43 but thought I'd try a \"real\" restaurant.  Never again!"}
{"text":"After a flight delay, I had to stay in Toronto for the night. If it wasn't for the $30 voucher I would never eat here. This place is equivalent to an Applebee's or TGIFridays in the states. I ordered teriyaki chicken bites  . Service was a bit slow even though there was barley anyone around. I do give them some pointers for having somersby! It's a danish cider, having lived in denmark for 8 months I really missed danish food and drinks, it was nice to see that elsewhere somersby was served."}
{"text":"Yuk! AVOID this place. First, the Fiji water bottle on the table is just waiting for you to open it so that they can charge you $5.99. That's what our waiter told us! And, there is no price marked on it. Second, they say their food is fresh, but when I asked for my burger without salt, I was told all the food. Ones from the basement and it's all pre- seasoned. And you can bet it's loaded with salt. T bird, when I decided that they could not  possibly ruin a piece of fish, I was told after I had ordered it, that it would be covered in flour before cooking it, even though there was no mention of this on the menu. Do we wonder why so many people are obese and that Diabetes is now so prevalent? This place certainly contributes. It was just impossible to find ANYTHING healthful on their menu. Toronto? This is just like the worst of these places in the US and I'm tired of finding this stuff on restaurant menus, especially when they pretend to be better."}
