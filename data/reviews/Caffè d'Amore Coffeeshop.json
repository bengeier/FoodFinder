{"text":"This café is amazing!! The cold brew coffee, the maple lattes....WOW I'm making this my everyday coffee spot. It's just so great!"}
{"text":"I wanted to make sure I gave this coffee shop several chances before writing a review. I've gone there approximately 8 times and have always had the same type of experience. Pros: OK coffee, great cookies, cute place. That's it. 

The first time I went, it was the first day they were opened. I ordered a cappuccino. The barista handed me my drink and said, \"Whoops. I wasn't paying attention and made a latte by accident.\" I took it anyway, but was shocked that she didn't even ask if that was OK. Every time I've gone in, I've felt like an inconvenience to the barista. One sat on her phone while I stood there waiting. Another said literally nothing and just stood there looking at me. I've gotten one friendly \"hello\" from one of the baristas, but that's it. Would it kill any of them to smile or say, \"Hey, how's it going?\" It's not an inviting atmosphere and only one barista seems even remotely friendly. Finally, I went in one more time and was utterly disgusted at the smell. It smelled as though a toilet overflowed and a pack of dead animals were piled up behind the counter. I was so disgusted and don't even want to know how a coffee shop (usually one of my favorite smells) had the ability to smell that bad. 

I'd love a good coffee shop down this end of LV and would even take a mediocre one. But, the unpleasant baristas and unwelcoming atmosphere is enough to make me drive to 6th Ward for coffee."}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere, and delicious coffee. The employees are welcoming and the little bookshop conjoined is perfect with a warm mocha."}
{"text":"I loved this place when they opened, but the hours kept changing, and the chairs are really uncomfortable. The coffee was really good. I wish there was more consistency in hours, and more space, because I live close by. Music was really great when I was there."}
{"text":"I stopped in here while waiting to meet someone to sell a dress to. She worked around the corner and I live a few blocks away. I got there early, which is my MO for most things. So I perused the menu and settled with a lavender lemonade which I know from experience I'm a huge fan of ANYWHERE. Seriously lavender lemonade is my go to drink in the warmer months add some alcohol and we are SET. Unfortunately no alcohol this time but it was divine! 
The staff was friendly and let me sit at the counter after I had ordered my drink \"to go\" and then decided to stay she didn't seem annoyed. 
The decor is adorable and welcoming and the bar set up is great if you want to get work done. I'll definitely be back this summer! They had great music playing too!!"}
{"text":"Great coffee shop!  Has everything that you would want - delicious coffee, cozy space, nice people, good music.  The kind of place that makes you happy that you live in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Decent spot. Felt a little bypassed and rushed but maybe they were understaffed or something. Tasty chai. Good traditional scone. Will be back."}
{"text":"Delicious coffee, adorable ambiance, and right next door to a local bookstore? Can't beat it. I had been inspired to make the trek down Butler to visit Caffè d'Amore from a coworker's tip and was treated to a perfect hot cup o' joe: plain and simple black drip coffee that was rich and slightly sweet without even a hint of bitterness. Even if the coffee hadn't been delicious, the way that it was served--Mason jar (which you can BYO!) tucked snugly into a knitted sleeve--was enough to merit a return trip. I enjoyed sitting at the counter and lingering over my coffee to the barista-curated Spotify over the speakers (Wolf Parade and the Dodos on that particular afternoon). Seating for larger groups is on the limited side. I look forward to coming back to try some of the espresso drinks."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the affogato here, and the fact that the shop is attached to a bookstore. It's a great place to enjoy a coffee, get some studying done, or read. The only drawback is that there isn't that much seating in the coffee shop. I have never had issues with it because I'm fine sitting at the countertop, but for people who need a whole table, during peak hours that might not happen."}
{"text":"I was sooo excited to try this place out.... and you probably are too cause I mean look at all these good reviews. I hate to possibly pop your Caffè d'Amore love bubble but I didn't have a good experience. The coffee is extremely over-priced to begin. Now I'm used to paying more for a cup at a smaller coffee shop because you're getting better quality and duh it tasted better than Starbucks. However my Iced Soy Vanilla Latte tasted like weird chocolate milk and my sister's Iced Almond Milk Latte tasted like \" a burnt bagel\". Paying $12 for milk and a bagel is not something I'll be doing again anytime soon. Another thing I was disappointed about was the lack of Vegan/ Gluten Free treats that they label as being accommodating to. I was there around 9 am, prime time for Coffeeshops during the weekdays, and the only thing that they offered with no dairy was banana bread. This wasn't a slice for a dollar or a small loaf. It was a smashed ball shape smaller than an 8 ball for pool and cost $3. I didn't end up purchasing it, but maybe call to see if they really have the options they advertise as selling. I sadly will not be back again."}
{"text":"This coffee shop is a great place to take a break from your 9-5. I love that local offerings are everywhere and that they make a strong effort to be conscious of the environment (compostable items bin, recycled paper cups, discounts for using reusable cups/ mason jars).

This isn't a candy shop, so you won't see mile-high whipped cream mounds and sprinkles and sauce on top of your drink. The drinks here are carefully and simply made. No gimmicky \"limited time\" flavors, but there are earthy seasonal favorites like lavender in the summer, maple in the fall/winter.

The baristas here are friendly and efficient. I don't know any by name. I like that none have ever tried to upsell me on my purchases. 

The only downside is that the drink sizes aren't large enough for me. I nurse a coffee or tea for a couple of hours, so I need at least 24 oz to get me through the next task.

Check it out if you're on this side of town."}
{"text":"I certainly found my new go-to coffee shop in Pittsburgh! It's located in the milder area of Upper Lawrenceville, so you're not fighting for parking spots or seating. It's a pretty active place, but not crowded (perfect).
The venue is great: it's very open and well-lit with big windows and multiple front entrances. Not sure this would be the best place to work, but there's outdoor seating and quite a few indoor spots.
There's also a bar there, which means you can chitchat with the very friendly staff and talk to the nice clientele. It's also worth mentioning there's plenty of reading materials and local event cards so you can see what's going on in the area.
Drink menu was extensive. I only got a standard drip coffee, but it was very tasty and it was served in a mason jar (very unique).
I can't wait to go back again and bring a friend or two--or I might just go back and chat with the baristas!
Great venue. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My new fave coffee shop.  It's in Upper Lawrenceville.  Really great place to chill, do computer work, enjoy the totally good playlists.  Ball Jars as coffee cups.  Hipster but norms would still feel welcome.  Sandwiches are tremendous.  Next- door and attached is Nine Stories Bookshop.  Super indie, but again, norms would enjoy the collective ennui (I mean that in a totally positive way)."}
{"text":"This is a great little coffee shop in Lawrenceville with great people! I'm a tea drinker and the selection is very good loose leaf tea. The hot chocolate is a favorite of those I've gone with and others have said how good the coffee is too. There are a few outdoor tables on the sidewalk  to enjoy. The only downfall is the indoor seating is pretty limited so going to do work or read might be hit or miss.

The connection to the book store is lovely - great to see two small businesses in one location!"}
{"text":"The coffee bar is actually set up as a bar and each barista (at least the ones I know) are all super friendly and intelligent- great conversationalists! And they are super passionate/nerdy about their coffee.  

Warmth in both the interior decoration and the staff = A superb place to have a cup a joe"}
{"text":"I love this place! Very friendly staff, awesome decor, and great coffee. My coffee passport lead me here and I got a maple latte and a plain bagel. The bagel was hard to chew and had a very different taste. Latte was delicious and served in a glass mason jar."}
{"text":"Neat little coffeeshop attached to a cozy bookshop. Got a Guatemalan Geisha pour-over brewed with a metal filter. It had some really clear tasting notes of cherry and woody flavor. However the tastes got muddier as the cup cooled and the brew method left a lot of fines in the bottom of the cup. Might try another pour over if we make it back. 

Intrigued by the shrubs offering, but ended up going for coffee. They were selling local artist/craftspeople work that looked really cool."}
{"text":"This place is super cute, and the woman working was so welcoming and personable. They have food as well as coffee drinks. I chose the vanilla latte and it was DELISH. I'm an avid Starbucks drinker so this was a good change of pace. The only thing i wish is that they had larger size cups!!"}
{"text":"Very probably one of the best kept secrets in Pittsburgh, which adds to the charm. 
  I love the overall vibes of kindness, and the coffee is fantastic. Definitely go here."}
{"text":"A nice relaxing local cafe with good coffee.  I love the latte in a mason jar. Feels great on a cold day such as today.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I'm a fan. This is a wonderful little third place. The staff is top-notch, the coffee excellent, and the eats delicious. I really appreciate how well-lit the shop is, too. 

My favorite thing here, though is the shrub--if you don't know what I'm talking about, you should check it out. The strawberry rhubarb shrub is the gateway drink. It's sour, sweet, and fizzy all at once. I want to drink it all of the time, truly."}
{"text":"Coffee. Books. Lavender lemonade. This place is adorable, the drinks are good, and I love the reading selection in Nine Stories. Must visit."}
{"text":"Super kind, helpful staff and delicious coffee and tea. The barista recommended the Kenyan pour over coffee and it was amazing. Great flavor. 

There aren't a lot of places to work but there are about 6 spots at the bar and a booth at the back. They also have free wifi.

My only complaint is that someone was either pressing or blending juices behind me and it was extremely loud. I didn't mind the loudness because I had headphones. In addition, the red juice was splattering everywhere and even got onto my computer. It would be nice if they put up a guard so that the juice (which stains) doesn't splatter."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to check out caffe d'amore for a long time and finally got around to it.

When you come in, there's immediately a chill atmosphere and the mason jar theme is pretty cute!

There's a good assortment of drinks and baked goods--the chocolate chip banana bread is a good choice

The lavender lemonade is amazingly refreshing, not so overwhelmingly floral flavor either!

Not too much seating, but if you want to study, your best bet will be the table out front, if it's available.

Make sure to check out the bookstore that's in the adjoining space as well!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here yesterday with my wife for our morning coffee.  We had both been past Caffe D'amore before but neither one of us had ever really noticed it.  However, it was on the Pittsburgh Coffee Passport and so we decided to head out and visit it.  It's located right on Butler St across 54th St from Cure.  The inside of it is warm and friendly with the walls painted both red and brown.  There is a bar with seating for about 6 or so and a couple other of tables both inside and out.  For my coffee on this morning I decided to try a maple latte while my wife went with the americano.  On my very first sip I thought that the coffee tasted a little bitter but it was almost immediately corrected by the maple and made me wonder if they did this on purpose.  Even if it wasn't on purpose it really worked well here and I enjoyed the maple sweetening the coffee and milk.  We also decided to order a pear, blue cheese and bacon on brioche while we were here which was made for Caffe D'Amore by the 52nd street market.  The sandwich itself was really good and was dominated by an abundance of blue cheese which both my wife and I loved.  Meanwhile the pear gave it some sweetness while the bacon added some salt to the sandwich.  Last but certainly not least was the brioche which had a nice and crunchy exterior and soft interior.

The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  My wife and I both enjoyed the coffee and the food."}
{"text":"I love to stop here for coffee.  There's an awesome little bookshop attached, where you can look around while they're making your drink.

The Ethiopian Amaro Gayo is my favorite coffee...it's tart and fruity.  You can get it ground up to take home.  Try a shrub spritzer...definitely not a typical soft drink.

They also have very good decaf coffee."}
{"text":"Cute place. Good coffee. Knowledgable and nice baristas. What more can you hope for? 

I was pleasantly surprised (who am I kidding... I practically yelled) when I discovered that they sell Om Nom Bake Studio sandwich cookies. For those who are unaware: Om Nom has the best sandwich cookies ever to exist in the history of all the universe. I believe they also offer some real sandwiches (of the non-cookie variety).

So far, I've only tried their matcha latte and a pour over and both were really great. They use Deeper Roots Coffee and I'm a new fan. I got a bag of the Guatemalan beans for home consumption and wow - it's delightful. 

I heard a lot of talk about the maple latte that's on the menu (made with real maple syrup). So I'll have to try that next time I'm around."}
{"text":"Came here on a beautiful Saturday morning and was met by a cozy little cafe! 
Definitely not your cookie cutter cafe, the shop was adorable and had a wide menu of drinks as well as savory and sweet treats!
Only drawback was that they don't offer soy milk for their drinks. However you are able to BYOS (bring your own soy)"}
{"text":"I love this coffeeshop!  Sarah the owner is awesome!  The coffee is top notch beans from Cincy and always fresh tasting. Love her decorations - eclectic and American.   Try the shrubs out too - great mixed with a cocktail or soda water."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this tiny coffee shop located in Upper Lawrenceville. They usually have a special of the day. Today it was mocha. I opted for the Ethiopian blend which is a medium roast.

The coffee comes as 8 oz or 12 oz and you can opt to have it in a mason jar. Should you wish to purchase the jar for $1.00, every time you come back with it you will receive $.25 off your next cup.

My coffee was indeed very good and I noticed that they are environmentally friendly. Many of their baked goods now come from Chateau Cake and cakery over on the Northside. Twice a week they get vegan donuts from Relish.Their tea is supplied by Dobra teas located in Squirrel Hill. Other beverages including hot chocolate are for sale as well.

The counter lady explained to me that their coffee comes from a roaster in Cincinnati, Ohio named \"Deeper Root.\" The business shares space with a neighboring bookstore called \"Nine stories\" but they weren't open yet as of my visit. They have counter top and a few table seating available.

Among their other products they sell \"shrub\" syrups in mason jars for mixed drinks. Free WiFi is available and if needed you may use the gender neutral restroom located in the bookstore.

I am truly blown away by the fact that they make use of everything including composting, recycling and other environmental friendly material. I did not stay for lunch but they get their sandwiches from the 52nd St Market a few doors down.

Free parking is available in this end of town. This is truly an amazing place to visit and great location without having to make the long trek to central Lawrenceville for coffee or tea."}
{"text":"I love trying out new coffee places, so I was excited to give Caffè d'Amore a visit. The shop itself is small but really cozy and quaint. There is a bar with stools as well as some other seating, so it would be great for catching up with a friend or doing some reading with a nice warm beverage in hand. 

I decided on an Americano and was pleased. It had the perfect espresso-to-water ratio, so that the espresso flavor was still robust and not too watery. I barely added anything to it (just some cream to mellow things out), which shows they're using high quality espresso that can stand all on its own. 

The guys working were both friendly and relaxed. The whole atmosphere is calm and quiet, and I can definitely see myself spending more time here in the future."}
{"text":"Very cute cafe! I could sit here all day with a latte and a good book. The space is small but there are a few tables and counter seating. They push the envelope a little with their drink menu which I love. I had to try the ancho chili mocha which is a twist on Mexican hot chocolate. It's got a very thick texture and powerful chocolate taste with a hint of chili to give it a nice kick. I can't handle anything remotely spicy so if it's safe for me, it's safe for anyone. They also have a great selection of donuts and pastries to satisfy your sweet tooth. 

The staff are also amazing! My barista went through the menu with recommendations to help me find what I would enjoy the most. I will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"I always appreciate a coffeeshop that has a great tea selection, and Caffe d'Amore has it! I love that they also offer teas from local Hillcrest Farms, number one because it's local and number two because it's good! I tried the Earl Grey and it was fab! 

Glad to also know that they carry almond milk, but I feel like with independent coffee shops, that's becoming the norm. I'm also obsessed with their lemonades. They had one last year that was lavender and I craved it! I can't wait to see what concoctions they'll come up with this summer!

I have to note that the employee was one cool chick. She was friendly to us, yes, but a homeless man came in that seemed to be not in his right mind, but very harmless. He was just talking and talking and she was so nice to him. She gave him her own clementine, which I thought was very sweet. She was just so patient and kind, and it was nice to see.

I like the bar set-up to work from more than the small table in the back (it's the only table in the place). It was a little awkward to have two computers at, and when we added a third, it was a bit much. I know it's a small place though, so I'm happy to stop in and grab some delicious tea or lemonade and work from the bar myself!"}
{"text":"A hip coffeshop with a relaxed yet cool atmosphere.

I really enjoyed my maple latte. It was $4.75 for 12 oz which was a fair price. It came with a pretty leaf design too! The mocha was delicious as well. 

The baristas were both super friendly and cool. 

If you get your drip coffee for there, it comes in a mason jar with a knit cozy. You can keep the mason jar for $1 and then every time you return with that same mason jar you get 25 cents off of your drink. This would be great for regulars! 

This cafe is tiny but there are 2 tables with chairs and 4 bar stools at the bar. If you can snag a seat, it would be a great place to chill and chat with friends or do some work. It's connected to a tiny local bookstore which doesn't have too man books but they have some literary totes and tee shirts that would make great gifts for your book loving friends and family.

Great coffee, great atmosphere, great service,  and overall a 5 star place!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place. Has the Lawrenceville ambiance. Small cool business. Lots of cool tea options and support farmshares. Almond milk available!"}
