{"text":"Red velvet was good, snickerdoodle sucked tho. Cold and hard as a rock. Lady wouldn't even let me switch it. They were closing in 30mins. Talk about customer service. Never going back there Smh"}
{"text":"What am amazing find!   Thanks to Yelp for the reviews.   Wonderful spot to meet up with friends for coffee and cupcakes.  Never mind the coffee shop next door.   The cake, cookies and cupcakes are beyond delicious.  Nice relaxed atmosphere.   Would be nice to have some music playing, but the food makes up for it.   Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I have been dreaming about the cupcakes and cookies that I bought the other day.  I am making another trip here very shortly as should you!"}
{"text":"I love this spot! They have the best red velvet cheesecake!!! They have friendly service as well."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried a few things from here today and didn't care for any of them. The NY cheesecake was very dry and burned dark brown on top - it also was overpoweringly almond flavored. We also got a vanilla cupcake, but it was so dry it crumbled apart when I removed the wrapper. The red velvet brownie was the last shot and it, too, was very dry. We like to shop locally owned businesses, but we won't be making a second visit here."}
{"text":"Awesome service. Delicious cheesecake! And several treats and sweets to select from. I love the warm feel and cozy atmosphere. I'll definitely be ordering cookies and passing by when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I expected fresh cookies and a cupcake that was not dry! The cookies taste as if they were frozen. I honestly should have went to Whole Foods for cookies. I really had high hopes for this place."}
{"text":"Red Velvet cheesecake and cupcakes are on point! Very moist and will leave you wanting more. I work close by this bakery and I'm always in here buying something. The Lemon bar is delicious as well!"}
{"text":"Incredible service and great cake! Ordered a birthday cake and it was done exactly as I had imagined.  Cake decoration is this much art as it is cooking, and I have to say they did a great job for a great price. I ordered a strawberry cake with a somewhat complex design, and the result was perfect. I also greatly appreciate the friendly service."}
{"text":"Got a dozen assorted cookies and brought them home for the family as a surprise treat.  Not one was worth eating, even my teen son took a bite, shook his head and spit it out.  Cookies were flavorless or overly dry.  The sugar cookies tasted bitter, like baking powder.  I never thought someone could mess up cookies this badly, and stay in business, but apparently I'm wrong.

Store looked great, and I had decent expectations.  Sadly, will not be back, not even to try the intriguing \"boujie\" cakes.

After the great cookie debacle, it's just not worth it.  Yuck.  :("}
{"text":"Sent cookies to a friend in the hospital.  He told me at least 5 times how much he loved the cookies.  They were very friendly and easy to work with as well."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. When I walked into the bakery, I didn't see anyone at first. Then, a very friendly employee came out. There were lots of delicious-looking treats. I chose a slice of almond cake. I am not sure if this just wasn't the right thing to order or what but it was the driest piece of cake I have ever eaten. It was crumbly it was so dry. Especially for the price, I was extremely unimpressed. I would be willing to try it again after the good reviews, I just have to be convinced that the quality of baked goods is better."}
{"text":"One of Charlotte's best kept secrets. I see some of the bad reviews and all I can think is that maybe they came in on an off day, and that happens when it's a family run business cranking it out every day, in my opinion. But I've had some of the best treats ever there. The Nutella brownie is to die for, and pick a cheesecake or a cheesecake brownie and you won't regret anything other than the scale the next time you step on it, because you will keep coming back. The fact that they deliver until midnight is just dangerous and I'm mildly angry about it. Doesn't hurt/help that they have a Philly Cheesesteak place right next door. #onestopshop Go get some. I've already talked myself back into it."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my visit here! 

If you are craving something sweet, this place will definitely hit the spot. They have cupcakes, brownies, cookies and much more! 

The staff was very friendly and upbeat! I decided to go with a red velvet cupcake. It was moist, and delicious. The cream-cheese frosting paired perfectly and I really enjoyed all the flavors. This was one of the best I've had in a while. 

Oh and they also have a rewards card and after the 10th item, you get a dozen cookies free!"}
{"text":"The brownies are awesome and the lemon pound cake.it is a plus that they remain open until midnight. It is the perfect time for a sweet fix."}
{"text":"The worst baked goods I have ever purchased.  Cupcakes dry enough to use for exfolient. Cookies that literally taste like nothing.  Hiw can a ginger cookie have NO FLAVOR??  Save your money."}
{"text":"Consistently good and the service is great too! 

I've ordered the peanut butter brownie, cheesecake brownie, and red velvet cake; all of which are moist and taste great! 

It's a good place to stop for any sweet and the prices are reasonable too!"}
{"text":"I love all things sweet and baked, and it doesn't take much to make me happy.  Unfortunately, competition is stiff in Charlotte with all the bakeries and other sweet tooth spots that I would have to rate this as just meh.

I stopped by after seeing them at the Sweet Tooth Festival and thought we'd give them a try.  It was around 9pm on a Thursday.  The girl working there was lovely and was very helpful, but the selection there didn't impress me.  The cupcakes seemed small and overpriced and a lot of what I wanted to try wasn't available.

We ended up just getting a salted caramel truffle and a salted caramel cupcake that they sell for cheap for being baked the day before.  They were both just OK and seemed like things I could make myself.

I did get a free latte after checking in on the yelp app.  Unfortunately the girl admitted she hadn't yet been trained on the latte machine, so I said no problem.  I'll come back another day."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like sweets?! Once I found out about this new bakery I made a special trip over. Finding the pay $6 for $12 deal through Yelp made it that more enticing...

Once inside the shop, I found it to be welcoming with a comfy seating area with a few table and chairs. The glass case was filled with fun looking pastries. They serve bagels, cheesecakes, eclairs, cookies, and cakes. They also have WiFi for the customers. Great location off of South Boulevard and across the street from the Scaleybark LYNX stop. 

I ordered some cookies ($6), bread ($8), and a couple of cheesecakes ($3.50 each). However, once I got them home, the cookies were hard (as if they were over baked) and the bread was dry. I quickly called them to see if they bake daily and I was told the bread is baked every Friday and supposedly the cookies are done daily, if not the night before. They also freeze their bread. The baker was very sweet, but asked if I tried rewarming the bread to freshen it up (not what I had in mind). However, she offered for me to return next week to get a fresh batch or to come back and pick out something else with store credit. Instead, I just wanted them to void my transaction and save myself the trip back...but to do so, they asked if I could return to get a refund...and so I did.

I think there is a lot of potential in this cookie shop. Although, they could easily make a few changes to make for a better experience:
1. Train staff to be knowledgeable of everything. For a small shop, It is disjointed to hear the employees say, \"I am only the ____. I don't know about ____.\"
2. Have prices on everything. I had no idea the bread was $8.
3. Don't ask for email addresses without saying what it is for and leave it as an option for customers to give. I felt pressured to give my personal email; I get enough ads, I like to be selective. 
4. Make sure the product is of high quality, especially because of the prices they are charging. I think of Cake Boss...he checks what goes out and says, \"Each time something goes out, it has my name on it...it better be good.\"

Lastly, the owner and staff were not aware of the Yelp deal and I felt the confusion. While the owner and staff were nice, sadly, I had a disappointing experience. I really wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"I am SO glad to have found this super sweet (no pun intended!) family owned bakery :) When I finally got over the sweetness of one of the owners (Tracy), I went ahead and purchased the $5 for $10 yelp deal! It was a BIG help, but I still went over budget......waayy over budget :( Which is okay with me because im a lifelong fan of mom&pop shops, and if anyone, they deserve our business. Sometimes you just want a familial touch, not some multi-million corporate flair with corny frills.

Honestly, I dont have a single sweet pearl in my mouth, but little sister does and so we decided to make the trek (quite a distance from my place). I got the Hershey's chocolate cake....Ahhhhmazing with cold milk, carrot cake for my mom, which was inhaled within the first few minutes ;) it was a round personal, almost palm sized treat that mom said she LOVED! Sugar monster got a gorgeous cupcake, as pretty as it tasted :D I also got a teddy bear (homage to build-a-bear, I was told for my niece and a baggie full of assorted cookies. I recommend the oatmeal raisin and snikerdoodle.

The treats dont stop there, too many to state---as you can tell, my essay......I mean review is already a booklet! Do pay a visit to this comfortable and home-y sweet salon, which is also a coffee house! Fair trade coffee. Oh! And the most memorable feature of this visit was admiring all the artwork and paintings that were done by the owners children, and getting to know the history behind the bakery. Very sweet :)

p.s: tell them the girl with the cane sent you ;)"}
{"text":"I had seen this place listed on Foodie Call multiple times and was always curious about it. So while I was out running errands I found myself driving down South Blvd and decided to stop in. The lovely woman who I gathered owns the bakery was extremely nice and took the time to explain her business, all the items she had in stock, and even to say what items they make but didn't have at the time. I decided to get the lemon cake, a nutella brownie, and the chocolate chip cookies. I also got one toffee cookie to try. I ate the toffee cookie on my way home and it was very good. None of it lasted in my house long so I'd say it was a hit but here's the breakdown as I tasted it... The chocolate chip cookies were obviously homemade however the formula isn't my favorite. They are really great cookies but you know how everyone has their own favorite type of chocolate chip cookie and this isn't my favorite way. I like pillow soft slightly underdone cookies. This were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and a thin batter cookie. Still great tasting though and I'm sure perfect for multiple people. The lemon cake was my favorite, but I have a weakness for lemon butter cream. The cake wasn't too dry which was a huge plus and the butter cream was well made however it was a little too buttery for my tastes, there were times I could literally taste just butter. I know that makes it sound bad but really it wasn't, it was delicious and would be perfect with a tad less butter. The nutella brownie was probably my least favorite as much as it pains me to say it. I may need to have my head examined but it was just too sweet for me lol. Chocolate brownie, with chocolate chips, and chocolate frosting!! I mean yummmy right!! That is the type of brownie you take two bites and save the rest for another day lol. Overall loved trying this place out and I'll definitely have to stop in again soon especially since they are open late and well you can get delivery. Can't really beat that!!"}
{"text":"After reading Candyce B's review (I always trust her judgment), I had bookmarked Kai's Kookies and when I found myself over that way today, I decided to stop in.

Located in a small strip mall just across from the Scaleybark Lynx stop (heading away from uptown on South Blvd, you can turn left onto Scaleybark and then make an almost immediate left into the shopping center if you can't do a u-turn at the South Blvd/Scaleybark light), it was a cute little shop full of sugary sweetness.

Priced as you would expect a small cookie/pastry/cupcake place to be, the selection was quite good.  Lemon bars, several different kinds of pound cake, cupcakes, cookies in many flavors - there was something for everyone if you are looking for a sugary treat.

I purchased a key lime cupcake which had AMAZING key lime flavor.  Sometimes these cupcake joints stick a piece of neon green candy in a vanilla cupcake and call it key lime, but the flavor really packed a punch in the icing, it was delicious.  The cake was pretty good and the icing wasn't grainy at all, it was well balanced and good.  I also purchased a dozen of the snickerdoodle cookies and they are YUM!  Soft with a very slight crunch to them, the sugar and cinnamon was well balanced.

The gentleman that was working (I am thinking he may be an owner based on his knowledge and demeanor) at the time was incredibly friendly and pleasant, letting me know about coupons that would be appearing soon in the Explore Your Hood coupon book for Ballantyne/Blakeney (which is my hood).

If I find myself in the area again and craving a treat, I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Just stopped in to try out the cupcakes at this place. Bought 4 different kinds and a caramel cashew cookie. The cookie was great but the cupcakes were horrible. :( They were so dry. I tried each one thinking it would get better, but it didn't. I may go back to get a cookie, but I am staying away from the cupcakes."}
{"text":"This place is my go-to for a sugar fix. Great service, nice owners, and amazing tasting treats! 

I love the chocolate chip cookie cupcake. 5 stars.

I also love the convenience for cupcake pick-ups for my co-workers' birthdays and business meetings. They are one of the only bakeries around that will accept AMEX-- awesome convenience factor."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with treats that are available late, late and until midnight!  

I was impressed with the friendliness of the owner. She was both effusive and patient when we stumbled in for our sugar fix. 

We sampled several cupcakes. A little too cold from the refrigerated glass showcase. The coldness just detracted from the fresh bakery feel but shoulders above any grocery store cupcake. I would be back for another late night treat and maybe a coffee this time too."}
{"text":"I stopped in here today after seeing ads on group discount sites. I was impressed with all of the choices including cupcakes, handmade chocolates, cakes, and cookies. I tried a sweet potato cupcake that had the most amazing frosting. I also indulged in a red velvet cupcake, which I have yet to find a true version of here in Charlotte. This one met the mark. This was true red velvet cake, not chocolate cake dyed red like most I have tried here. The frosting was a perfect buttercream with a pecan garnish on top. I can't believe I have never visited this place before. This is a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Okay  so I  seem  to  have  become  addicted  to  this  place. There are a few inconsistencies  I  need to point out though. First is that  like  other Yelpers  have  noticed  this bakery has three different  names. The name above  the  front door, the name on the receipts  and the name on the emails. They need to pick a single  name  and stick with it.
The second  inconsistentcy  is that you don't  have  any idea what's  available  from day to day and if it's moist or dry. You might think  that  I'm  only talking about  the cake being dry, but oddly I've  also  experienced  frostings  that are dry as well. So it's really  hit or miss when you visit.. I've sampled almost  everything  they have and I  think that I'll  stick with what's  been  proven  to  be  good.
The carrot cake and the Hershey chocolate cake were excellent. My friend also enjoyed his cupcakes."}
{"text":"Excellent Cookies!  As the Man says!  \"Made Every day\"!  This was my first time and I enjoyed Four Cookies!  They do have Cupcakes and other Treats too! 

Chocolate Chip!  Tastes as good as Mom's!  

Toffee!  Fantastic!  Lots of Soft Toffee!

Peanut Butter Very Nice!

Sugar Very Good!

They have some Tables inside so you could stay to eat if you wanted!"}
{"text":"Stupendous Coconut cake hideout... If your a coconut cake fan...run, don't walt to Kai's... no disappointment allowed."}
{"text":"Walking into the place, you're not really sure what you're getting into. The shop is older, has a stale smell, and horrible interior lighting. 

However, aside from the desperate need of an interior makeover, the baked goods are delicious. We tried the brownie cheesecake, and a slice of cheesecake; they were delectable. The cheesecake recipe is not the traditional New York, fluffy kind, it's more dense and not as moist, but still really good. We also tried a cookie, it was just your average cookie though. 

I would recommend it based off of what I've tasted so far in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Tried the toffee cookies and they were stale!  I was beyond sad.  

Fortunately the other half of my one pound purchase was peanut butter cookies and they were PERFECT.  Soft, crumbly and crispy all at the same time.  Also bursting with flavor.

Also....THEY DELIVER!!!"}
{"text":"I haven't found the best part of this bakery yet.

I bought some chocolate chip cookies that were on the small side and a little expensive, but not \"out of this world good.\"

I can feel the owner's dedication and I want to give this place a few more tries."}
{"text":"I recently needed a corporate gift that was quick, easy and still personal. I found out Kai's did cookies with my company's logo on them and was so excited!  The process could not have been easier - I just emailed my logo and two days later I had delicious, soft cookies with my logo on it!  The icing was perfect too - just sweet enough but not overly so. 

And since I have an incredible sweet tooth, while i was picking up stuff for work, I also got a slice of the almond pound cake.  YUMMY!  Dense and rich and fantastic.

This place is in a nondescript shopping center so it is easy to miss, but do yourself a favor and check it out!"}
{"text":"Above and beyond service! I live in Washington and placed a delivery order of cupcakes through GrubHub for a friend's son who just had surgery. The folks at Cosmic Bakery called me and offered to include a card and personalized the order. Truly exceptional service!!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of this place. They are open until late. I was too early to catch the Megabus from Charlotte. I happen to find this place accidentely, as the place next to it, Eaglespeak was about to close.

They got good coffee, muffins, and desserts. I had a cup of coffee on my way to catch megabus on Friday late night. I went back again on Monday morning after my trip from Washington DC. This is good and have comfortable seating. 

Overall a nice place to pick up some coffee and desserts."}
{"text":"Delicious cookies! Thanks to the Yelp discount I was able to purchase multiple items at a low price. Very reasonable prices. I recommend the snickerdoodles, chocolate chip, peanut better, toffee coconut, and cashew carmel. The cookies have a crisp outside and semi-soft inside. I across got a slice of the orange mango cake. Yummy as well. The staff was extremely nice and patient with me. I will definitely go back!!!"}
{"text":"I feel badly having to write this review. I really wanted to like this place. I'm all about giving local small businesses a try. First of all, the owner needs to decide what the name of her business is going to be. On the Yelp app it's called Cosmic Cookie Bakery however when you drive up to the store on the outside it says \"Bake me a Cake\". The selections in the display were sparse, IMO. I was looking for some treats to take to work for some colleagues but was looking for something gourmet (you know, not your average cookie and in a cute box). All I could get here was assorted cookies inside a plastic clamshell container. My fault for planning at the last minute and not shopping around. I ended up only giving out some of the cookies and kept one. Taste wise they were nothing special.  I will say that the owner (Tracey?) and her employee were very nice, friendly and helpful. This might be a cool place if you're just craving something sweet but I won't use them again for gift giving."}
{"text":"A friend/business associate invited me to the place next door, but I decided to pop in to Kai's to see what they had to offer.  Quite a bit.  There was an array of cupcakes, slices of cake, half-empty cookie jars (great for the owner--bad for me because I wanted one), fruit truffles, bars...you name it.

I brought a bunch of stuff home to try, which included:

1 oreo cheesecake
2 mango truffles
2 strawberry truffles
1 pumpkin cupcake
1 strawberry cupcake
1 zucchini bread
1 sugar rush ;-)

I was pleased with mostly everything.  The truffles were a delight with bits of real fruit in each one. I prefer the mango to the strawberry, but both were still good.  The cupcakes were also good but my gripe about all cupcakes I've eaten is that they're over frosted.  This one was too; sometimes less is more, but the cake was moist and that's the most important part.  The zucchini bread was delicious--my boyfriend and I both ate that.  The Oreo cheesecake is still in the refrigerator--I wasn't too thrilled with that (and neither was he--that's why it's still in there).  I can't really describe it but it just didn't work that well for me.

Overall, however, I like Kai's and will return when I'm back on that side of town. The owner is a very nice lady who'll you enjoying meeting whenever you stop in."}
{"text":"Great cute little bakery. Stopped in to warm up and it just smells amazing. Perfect latte, a red velvet cheesecake brownie?! How is that even possible?!  Everything was delicious, what a lucky find. Friendly couple running the place, well worth the stop."}
{"text":"Ordered through grub hub and never got my food. Had to cancel my order and get a refund. This was going to be my first time trying this place, and now will be my last."}
{"text":"The only place I found which serves very nice cookies and coffee and is open till midnight. Can't miss this."}
{"text":"Stopped in to get a couple of small treats for a friend and myself. I got a chocolate on chocolate cupcake and a piece of almod pound cake. 
The girl behind the counter was sweet. 

The chocolate cupcake was moist, but nothing remarkable. 
The poundcake however, was dry and hard. I liked the almond flavor of the frosting (not overpowering), but the texture of it was a little grainy. 
I wouldnt get anything from there again."}
{"text":"Ordered the \"Dead Head\" cookie sampler from GrubHub. This sampler consists of 12 assorted cookies of any kind, baked to order, a pint of milk, and ice cream. I paid for delivery, and got a call 30 minutes later saying the delivery driver was not in that day, so I opted for a refund.

A week later, the same deal happens but I opted to remove the delivery fee and drive down instead. The solo employee there was kind, so I can't take off points there, but the overall experience was a let down.

First off, once I arrived to pick the order up I found out they baked the wrong cookies, claiming that the previous shift's baker did not inform her of the correct order. Because of this, half of my order was not available when I went to pick it up. What was a dozen assorted cookie flavors became 6 chocolate chip, 6 peanut butter cookies, and 2 of some other kind thrown in for free to make up for the hassle. I do not recall what the name of the extra 2 were, but there certainly had little to no flavor at all, tasting mostly like plain cookie dough.

The other cookies were alright. The chocolate chip cookies had way too much chocolate, all clumped at the bottom of each cookie (see the pictures) and the peanut butter cookies were pretty good. Overall they were all baked for an appropriate amount of time.

The ice cream was just a pint PET chocolate ice cream, and the milk came in a plastic cup in a bag (good thing I noticed that before I threw the bag in the passenger seat, I would have assumed it was in a sealed container since it was in a folded bag).

We did decide to buy a brownie, which was easily the best thing we had from there. Solid, moist, tasty, and overall worth the $3.50 it costs.

Overall, this was a $6 meal that costed us $24. I would not recommend buying the \"Dead Head\" sampler from here. Individual cookies were a dollar, so that wouldn't be a bad idea if you were just stopping by, though. I'd highly advise either baking your own or buying cookies from a grocery store instead, because the value just isn't there for this place.

Lastly, this business has about 3-4 different names, which is misleading and unprofessional. Online they are referred to as \"Cosmic Cookies\" in some places, \"Kai's\" in others, and the sign outside of their shop read something along the lines of \"Take A Cake Bakery\". I see potential here, but they appear to not have their business together, which means I likely won't be using them for cooperate catering or custom cakes in the near future."}
{"text":"Just horrible! The young man let me in and after hours. I was surprised that there was no music no t.v. on. Just quiet akward! Anyway the carmel latte was disgusting! White mocha was  just ok. BUT THIS DAMM OREO CHEESE CAKE! The worst ever! I was a cheesecake not half of a marble cake.  With the nastiest homemade oreo fluff ehhh. Just nasty! Dont bother to waste your time."}
{"text":"Delicious food at very reasonable prices! Atmosphere really relaxing. Staff very knowledgable about products, all of which are homemade.
Highly recommend the Banana pudding cream cheesecake and the Carrot cake."}
{"text":"Upon entering in this location after finding it on Yelp, when I was craving for something sweet after dinner nearby, I was hesitant and thought this can't be that good. 

They had jars with an assortment of cookies, a variety of baked brownie, and such. So I only ordered a few cookies because I didn't want to turn around and walk out empty handed. 

I drove off and tried one of the cookies; lo and behold I had to turn the car around and order more cookies and even tried a few brownies as well. Everything was fresh and delicious. 

I will definitely  be back,  if I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"I've visited this bakery around 7-8 times and usually really enjoy it. There's a great selection and the desserts are yummy! However the past few times I've visited, I've noticed the portions are getting smaller and the taste has gone down a bit. I visited this evening with a Yelp coupon and was pleased with the price, but when I got home and sampled my treats I found them to be a bit lacking. When I was at the bakery I remarked to the cashier that the red velvet cheesecake I have purchased every time I visit was clearly much smaller than usual. She told me it's the same size it's always been.. I also purchased a lemon brownie and I've also purchased it before. Today it was very chewy and hard and kinda tasted like nothing. I purchased two red velvet cupcakes tonight as well, the icing tasted off and there was an unusually small amount of it. I will try again, in hopes it was just a bad night."}
{"text":"This place is cute and staff friendly but the baked goods leave much to be desired. Dry flavorless almond cake and a average lemon bar. 

This place reminds me that I should start back baking again. It's not good at all."}
{"text":"Tried the cupcake and cookie.... I knew it wasn't going to be good when I mistakenly turned my cupcake upside down it's container and the icing didn't move. The icing was stiff and the cupcake was dry and taste very generic. Never again! The cookie was okay, but still not good enough to return. And to top it off paid $8 for 2 frosted cookies and a cupcake!"}
{"text":"I found this gem! I have a new favorite place! The customer service was excellent, banana pudding cheesecake was BOMB (that means good... lol) and so was the carrot cake was delicious as well!!! Yummmmm!"}
{"text":"Cookies and cup cakes are delicious.  Very disappointed in delivery service.  Ordered cookies and cupcakes to be delivered to my husband at his place of employment.  Gave My home phone number and his office number.  At time of order stated if he was not there to leave order with reception.  Delivery window was 11:00 to 1:00.  Order was delivered at 1:20.  Two calls were placed to My husband's office one asking if he was there for a delivery, second call asking for me.
Did give my home number.  Twice during order I stated correct spelling of my name.  One L in Michele.  Card had two L's.  Owners reason this is how she spells Michele with two L's.  Reason for calls they were running late.  Had I been told this would be be a surprise, if delivery was running late I would NOT have placed order with this company.  Kai's Kookies will Will not discount delivery charge of $15.00.  Only offered me a credit for future orders, but did not state amount.  Product is excellent.  Do not feel Kai'a treated me as a valued prospective customer."}
