{"text":"I am a weekly customer of this frys.  I use the Bank of America located inside of it, and all facets of frys.  I prefer to shop here than at other stores - it has a good hometown feel to it. 

There isn't much that is special about the frys, it has a standard layout, no special features, maybe even a bit dated in its dsign - but they provide great specials, good variety, good bakery.  

I am there all the time - dig it."}
{"text":"Obviously Frys is always awesome and has great prices! I come here very often and love it. Prices are great and the customer service is super friendly. However, one of their employees that makes this store stand out and run especially well when she is working is Sally Joe! She remembers us by name, always in a great mood, and keeps the self checkout line moving efficiently!! My family LOVES her! 

Tonight we went for the 2nd time today haha and she was missing and you could tell. All the lanes were closed except self checkout and things were a mess. Non the less, I'll always shop at this location!"}
{"text":"Frys food on southern and mill.

Shop at this location weekly, and use to visit daily when we lived closer.

Has been remolded few years ago, still not as nice as rural or mcclintock stores.
Service is fair to good depending on who you have help you. 

Manager Roy and Bridget are great. 
Maria needs some cs classes.

Sally Joe is sweetest checker ever.

Dont go in from 11:pm till close as they only run self checkouts. About 11:15/1130 the company resets all computers so you have to wait for reset of everything.
Been like this for 5+ years, all good treatment and great experinces go out door when you wait half hour to buy a soda, with staff watching/taking pictures of \"longest line they ever saw\"
instead of helping customers.


Free wifi
Bike locks x2
Drive thru pharmx
Gas station \"frys gas\"
Managers will order items for you



Good or Bad CS?

Fair CS"}
{"text":"I do love Fry's in general, but not this particular store.  They redid the store, and though it is very nice, the customer service is still not where it should be.  This store is closer to me, but I go out of my way a little to go to a different store because the staff is nicer and it seems that the selection is larger."}
{"text":"Friendly , helpful , I always get a good morning and a good evening!  I live in Phoenix but work near by I rather gas up and shop here than the frys near me in Phoenix! The Only reason I don't give it 5 stars  is because often I've have to wait a very long time  to get assistance in the bakery"}
{"text":"Looking good after that facelift, Fry's. Hubba Hubba ;)"}
{"text":"This Fry's location is beautiful.  I can't believe how much effort was put into the decor...very impressive.  It is clean and streamlined.  Even though, I don't eat meat, my friend and I picked up some apricot rotisserie chicken and fried chicken for a gathering and it was a hit!  They also have a nice selection of desserts."}
{"text":"This is by far the cleanest of all the supermarkets around the Tempe area.  The deli items were fresh and reasonably priced unless you go with BoarsHead which will \"Boar\" a hole in any budget.  Deli staff had hair nets and mouth covers.  I like that.  The deli staff at  Fry's on 90th Street and Shea (Scottsdale) will actually have conversations with each other while they slice your meats not realizing that when you speak you generate saliva which then sprays onto the meats being cut.  I must reiterate that I like idea of the mouth guards.  Thank you management for enforcing this health code!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for awhile now and I think im going to stop. The \"cooked\" chickens coming out of their deli are sometimes completely raw on the inside and on more than one occasion i've bought their overpriced strawberries only to discover that the ones i couldnt see from the outside where completely rotten and covered in white mold. It doesn't happen all that often but seriously, Im paying money just to throw food in the trash because they dont know how to run a supermarket, disgusting."}
{"text":"This store is absolute trash in comparison to its counterpart on rural. Down from the store appeal to the employees who legot try to get out of working in any way possible. The butcher always trys charging to season things even though its advertised for free, the cashiers will even mutter things about you as soon as you walk away. I hope they learn from the other location. The only reason i end up here is because it happens to be closer"}
{"text":"I had never been to a Fry's before I moved here from CA, but I have to say. the prices and deals here are wonderful. This Fry's in particular has some of the friendliest customer service! I love that the employees can put customized pins on their aprons, it's great for good conversation at check out. They carry Boar's Head cheese and meat products in the deli and I always get a half pound of turkey for my sandwiches. It might be a little pricier than Wal-mart or Winco, but it is worth the experience!"}
{"text":"I have been here on a couple of occasions to buy donuts for my coworkers. Today I actually went grocery shopping here. I was very happy with their fruit selection and their customer service. I don't have a Fry's card but the lovely lady behind the counter gave me the discounts anyway. I will be going here again for my grocery needs."}
{"text":"love Frys
however have a concern
Bought ice cream Private selection Amaretto Cherry Cordial
got home, and no protection cellophance tape on the outside, so i thought ok, then it must have a protective layer over the top, nope none
is this normal,.because i THINK THIS is a bit scary...."}
{"text":"Ahhhhh Ghetto Fry's.  This is where I used to buy sandwiches with change when I was super broke using the self-checkout kiosks.  

Just recently, I had a bunch of change to redeem and I thought of places to hit up a Coinstar.  \"Ghetto Fry's,\" I decided.

This place is very, very strange.  I remember walking in one time and everyone looked scared.  I don't know how to explain it, but everyone sort of stopped what they were doing and looked at me with these blank expressions and I wondered to myself what was going on.  Was the place getting robbed or something?  Suddenly, someone screamed and someone else yelled out, \"There it is!\"  That's when I saw a manager chasing a bird with a broom.  The bird had knocked some shit off of some shelfs and caused quite a commotion.

If I had a nickel for every time I came into this Fry's location either drunk, stoned or both, I'd have enough money to buy myself and three of my closest friends Flinstone's Push-Pops.

The cashiers and the managers are all nice, but rest assured, if you shop here, you will encounter mutants.  And I do mean mutants.  The store itself is actually sort of depressing.  There are definitely normal people who shop here, like college kids and stuff but it seems like the place sort of wallows in its own self-pity.  If you shop here enough times, you WILL see someone in a motorized wheelchair absolutely furious with a cashier that they cannot buy alcohol with an EBT card.

It does the job, though.  If you live around here, their produce is fresh, they have good prices and you can get in and out relatively quickly because it's laid out pretty nicely."}
{"text":"While I reviewed them awhile ago as a 2 for lack of customer support in the late evenings and disrespect. Since then they have made leaps and bounds. As such proudly give 4 stars.

Previous issues...
*(Only self checkout, long line, no registers open, staff taking pictures of long line)
*(Removed bike racks)
*(Refused to look in back for product)
*(Debra and checker being rude)
*(Being on phone while working)

Currently they are on top of their game at the Mill location. 

*Open stands when needed and able to. 
*Order product not in stock
*Store non carried items so can still be purchased.
*Positive attitude's when interacting with.
*Cell phone use is down but not eliminated.
*Joins in with local events helping community.


Best Frys food in east valley!!"}
{"text":"Had a bad experience here with Debra. I politely asked her if she wouldn't mind opening up a register for me so I could checkout since all of the self checkout lanes were occupied. This was late one night when all the other registers were closed and many people were waiting to checkout. She looks at me and says \"What for?\". Now usually the customer should not have to explain themselves but I'm suffering from type 2 diabetes; my vision isn't like it was when I was younger and sometimes my joints and muscles ache and using the self checkout machine is difficult for me. I eventually got what I wanted but this experience has given me anxiety, and a fear of going back. If my family friend, John Flora were still alive, I know HE would make things right! What a shame!"}
{"text":"My kids and I do our weekly shopping at this Fry's location. The selection is great, the prices are reasonable, and the service is top notch (everyone goes out of their way to say hi to my kids)!"}
{"text":"Not anymore.

20 minutes to check out, as only the self-checkouts were open and available.  5 people cruising around in front of the closed \"person-operated\" registers but no manned register opened for over 15 minutes.   25 people waiting in line behind 6 who were at the self-checkout?

WTF?  

It's Sunday evening, too many people in line and whomever is in charge does not have someone open a register?

By the time I got to the self-checkout, the ice cream I came to get was pretty much a waste.  I paid for milk, OJ and broccoli, but left the ice cream.

While you are the closest to home, you are CERTAINLY not the best.  You have lost my business."}
{"text":"I found it funny that there are 2 Frys stores within a mile of each other. I've been to both locations often and prefer this location on Mill. 
They have a butcher counter, are \"remodeled\", and have the sushi counter. 

My biggest complaint is the smoking area is too close to the front door. If you exit the north double doors your 95% likely to get a whiff of cigarettes in your face. Plus it's weird to see employees out there goofing off or taking their smoke break.  

Employees are friendly at check out and the store is pretty clean inside."}
{"text":"When I was told we were going to Fry's, I thought we were going shopping for electronics (http://www.frys.com/).  So I was surprised when we ended up at a grocery store.  We were there specifically to get wine for our hosts for the weekend.  I was impressed with their selection and prices - very similar to what I am accustomed to.  I ended up finding a very reasonable Sauvignon Blanc that I will be stocking up back home for a daily drinking wine."}
{"text":"Yup, it's Fry's. This store doesn't seem as nice as the one on McClintock and Baseline and the parking lot feels more narrow but this location has a fuel center which makes it convenient if you have fuel points to use up. There was someone manning the gas station at a booth in the center that provided good service.

A friendly associate was there at the self check out who helped me out when I accidentally put in the wrong grocery code and it was no problem getting stamps from here too. I'll probably be back to this store more often to get groceries due to the fuel center and the fact that there's a bubble tea shop in this same plaza. : )"}
{"text":"We have shopped at this Fry's Food Store more often than we like.  The problem is when we're in the area it is convenient but we do go out of our way often to spend our $$ at other stores and only go here when absolutely necessary.  

Checkers rarely speak to you.  Baggers are on cell phones.  Staff is so involved in their conversations with each other that it's not unusual to go through a line and not exchange one word with the checker.  This is more the experience than not the experience.   It's got to have one of the rudest group of grocery store employees we've ever seen.  If you have a question or need to ask the checker anything at all, you need to interrupt the ongoing conversation first.

 A recent complaint of service to one of the young managers was no different.  He was rude and blamed the fact they had to have a union and couldn't do anything about the employees.  I do believe if they had good management at this store, the treatment of customers would also improve.  Training starts at the top and not from the bottom.  Maybe instead of staff change, it's time for a management change.

We find no problem whatsoever with food quality or shelves.  The problems happen on your way out of the store up front."}
{"text":"Linda in the meat department is extremely rude. I have had several bad experiences with her and so has my husband. She gets irritated when you ask simple questions about the meat or basically when you speak to her at all. She always seems to busy and it seems as if you are interrupting her. She doesn't have time to do her real job, which is help you get some meat or fish! I dread going up to the meat counter when she is there. This isn't just a one time thing, I wrote it off the first time as maybe she was having a bad day. But after the 3rd time I have had enough!"}
{"text":"Im giving it a 3 because I am sick of the crummy beer selection. Where the H is the Hefeveisen. At least get some Kiltlifter in there, there is a local brewery, who's in charge of the beer contracts there..this is TEMPE..and we do likes to get our drink on! But Im not giving it a 1 because the people that work there are so nice and they always help me when I mess up in self checkout (cause im in a hurry) but get held up juggling coupons, credit cards, cash back..but I'll tell you what, I LIKE putting my own stuff in the bags how and where and how many I like or do not like. Dont be squashing my bread and my salmon wants it own 2 bags and watch out for my tossed salad! They have great plants too."}
{"text":"We don't have Fry's back home in Pittsburgh, so this was a new place for me . Pretty much its an average grocery chain store, except they have a sister store with some nicer thing's, Fry's Marketplace. You have to get one of the \"Fry's Club\" cards if you want to save any money. I hate those cards, it means they jack up the prices and then offer you the real price if you had the card, ugh. Same scam everywhere. So when I do shop there, I generally only buy items that are on sale to club members and/or I might have some coupons too, from the Sunday paper. The last time I shopped there I got about $240 in grocery's and paid $160, what a savings just by using the card :D"}
{"text":"I buy trays of food for work every week from the fry's a block a way (rural /southern), but this store just found themselves a loyal customer. I called the rural/southern store to ask whether they sell a specific Gift Card and they told me to come in and check because they might have it.  I don't live close so I called this fry's and Amanda and Barbara took the time to check. I will be buying my trays of food from this one now.  Good customer service goes a long way."}
{"text":"Being from Cali the only Fry's we have is a Electronic Store. However Fry's in AZ is like an Albertsons or Ralps. Luckily i made it on Thanksgiving Day 10 minutes before they closed to pick up some pies to bring to our Thanksgiving dinner. Place was hectic, but i expected nothing less shopping for something last minute on a holiday."}
{"text":"We have been shopping at this Fry's for many years. I like the small town feel and it's nice to go where the customer service is friendly and they recognize us. On occasion they may not have an item because it is a smaller store but I can go to another Fry's for that.  I will continue to shop here as long as we live in Tempe.  
The prices are reasonable and the produce is excellent."}
{"text":"The new Fry's in the burbs are awesome, but this old relic is pretty bad. Ugly with a with a smaller selection, plus staff who pass you in the aisles (when you're obviously looking for something) without asking if they can help. If you're in this neighborhood, head over to the nearby Safeway."}
{"text":"I love the heck out of Fry's grocery stores,  even so I generally avoid this one. It's just a bit dingy and the staff isn't that nice. To add to that, the lady at self checkout broke my drivers license a month ago, and her response was to tape it back together and send me on my way. My following visit, the man at self checkout denied my broken drivers license and once again I was sent packing. Now I refuse to go there. I'd much rather go to the one on Rural and Southern. The staff is much nicer and the store is bigger and cleaner."}
{"text":"So after going back a few times looking for certain things...I've noticed a few more things. 
They often don't have what I am looking for. They have your basic stuff, but if you need anything even slightly out of the ordinary, they probably won't have it. Or they'll have it, but it won't be in stock.
A bit of an inconvenience, but a popular problem.
But I was more annoyed at the prices I noticed today. The prices, not for everything, but a few, are jacked up. There were some things where I know for a fact at other stores, sell for 98 cents. And at this Fry's cost $4!!! Seriously?!
I'm pretty sure it's cause it's so close to campus. Stores closer to college campuses tend to have much higher prices. 
So while the service here is phenomenal, if saving money is more important to yu, I'd suggest checking out another Fry;s farther from campus."}
{"text":"I really appreciate how they show their customer - appreciation. I get coupons for free stuff in the mail, I get weekly free stuff, I get low prices on the  items that I need most frequently , and weekly sales."}
