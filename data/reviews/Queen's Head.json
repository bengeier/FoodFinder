{"text":"We ordered 1lb wings and the shepherds pie to be delivered. Apparently they can't tell the wings from the legs since it was a mixture of the two. The shepherds pie was the most abysmal version that anyone could make. It's a blob of ground beef with a teaspoon of carrots/peas and covered upto 2 inches thick with mashed potatoes. First pie in history to not have been baked. This dish had definitely not seen the inside of an oven. Please start along this ground beef and mashed potatoes and do not insult the shepherd pie genre with this abomination.   Poor service to top it all off. Thanks for a great Friday evening."}
{"text":"Cozy, very casual and food was good. I had wings and indian poutine. Calamari was great. I like it"}
{"text":"horrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   The staff consists of a bunch of hungover unprofessional children with no experience.  Do not go here.  There are so many other places in the area.  Waste of time,  waste of money."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I'd give this place a 3.5  THE GOOD: Clean, friendly, and great selection of beers. The food is decent pub grub: wings, nachos and butter chicken were all tasty and well priced. If you're looking for artisnal food there are many other places to go in Leslieville, but if you're looking for a decent sports bar I recommend.   THE BAD: The TVs behind the bar are not strategically laid out. Some portions seem small (skimpy toppings on the nachos) and every time I finished my beer I had to ask for another (rather than the waitress/bar staff staying atop of it, which to some might not be a bad thing)."}
{"text":"This pub has become our local as it's literally around the corner from us so it makes stopping in for a quick bite a little too easy. I'm a big fan of the chicken wings, specifically the Thai sweet chili and jerk sauces, the standard \"hot\" doesn't really standout for me. I'm also a poutine fan and their Indian version with a butter chicken sauce is indulgent and worth it!  If you're in on a game night (hockey or football) it'll likely be playing on a big screen. They realize groups tend to watch sports together and have catered to this with several large tables. However you want to arrive early as tables fill up quickly.   I also want to callout the staff which have always been super friendly. And that was before we became regulars. They are prompt and do their best to avoid blocking the TVs while they work.   All in all, totally worth stopping by. And if you're into supporting local they've got Left Field on tap!"}
{"text":"This is a great British Pub. They've got a cool menu with curries. Had the tandoori wrap and it was great! Plus in the summer the pub is \"open air\" which is great."}
{"text":"Oh Queens Head, I really wanted to like you...but I'm afraid I can't.  Beer selection is odd, and food is very typical and kinda boring. With so many better pubs in the Beaches, this one could be easily forgotten."}
{"text":"11$ calamari app; 11$ lb of wings; Several types of poutine for around 8$.  Ceasar brunch special: 4$! Pretty typical respectably cheap bar.   When it first opened I was excited. Thought it would provide an alternative to the remarkably sleazy Dukes across the street. It did... Somewhat. Everything about this place is slightly less downtrodden than Dukes. But only slightly. And they don't have the AMAZING patio that Dukes has.   The staff here is cuter (why they didn't hire me,  I'll never know).  And one feels less like a coke addict here (you can feel in your bones how much coke has gone up noses in the washrooms across the street). There have also been less people shot here."}
{"text":"Not a review of the food.  Place was not what we expected.  Menu seemed very expected.  Food sightings on neighbouring tables were not pleasant.     We waited 5 minutes without being served before we decided to politely change our minds and fled.     Won't be giving them a second chance."}
{"text":"Stopped in around 10:30. Good place to go for a cheap beer. Not as busy and crowded as some of the bars closer to downtown, which is nice when you come with some friends and want to be able to chat. Typical pub food. Got the nachos - nothing to write home about. The staff here was friendly."}
{"text":"Good spot for beer, pub food and sports.  I've stuck to the basics on the menu (wings, burger, fries/poutine) and they are decent.  Good drink specials everyday and ample TV's plus a big projector screen.  Service is also nice.  A place I can easily find myself in catching a Raptors game on a weekday.  I've never been on a weekend, but imagine it can get a bit rowdy with dukes across the street."}
{"text":"Horrible pub!!! They don't put on  the volume for sports games and always show stupid stuff like women's soccer that nobody watches. No offense to women's soccer I support it but when everyone's watching something else you should give people what they want .. . don't show what you like all over the place. HORRIBLE!!!"}
{"text":"I want to show this place a bit more love than I see on other reviews, because I haven't had a problem during any of my half a dozen (or so - maybe more at this point?) visits.  We usually go on Wednesday nights.  The place usually isn't crowded, and they are always able to accommodate no matter how large the group.  The food is pretty standard pub fare, but the serving sizes are massive.  I have never once left feeling like my hunger hasn't been vanquished.  The club sandwich is really sizeable, and the fries are awesome.  I've enjoyed their all-day breakfast, and their thai green curry is a really awesome and hearty option if you're looking for something gluten-free.  The service has always been on point, and we've never had an issue with being ignored or not getting our food in a timely manner.  It's also a great place to watch a game, as there are TVs everywhere, not to mention a large screen and projector for bigger events.  All in all, it's not fancy, but it is consistent, delicious, and you will get your money's worth."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with friends on a Wednesday night. Service and food was good.  I had the burger and it was cooked nicely.  Beer on tap included Left Field, Junction and Beaus.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Queen's head has decent quality food and the portions are very generous. My favourite dish is the guacamole avocado burger: it's a homemade patty and the ingredients are fresh. I order it almost every time I go in. The other winner is the signature Indian poutine, and they have huge 1/2 price wings on Tuesdays (which are breaded and get soggy with sauce, so I suggest getting the sauce on the side or the Cajun spice).  The place gets really busy when Toronto teams are in the playoffs, so get there early enough before the games starts to get a table. The waitstaff have been consistently friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for this place to open since they put up their signage a couple months ago as the Eastender closed.  Unfortunately this place has missed the mark for Leslieville.  With pub food like McGugan's nearby I was hoping they would have raise their level higher than a chain pub.  All the food seems to be frozen from my account. So, you do get what you pay for. I knew as soon as I saw the prices what type of quality to expect.  They did not seem to have anything to set them apart. The wait staff was just ok, it took a while each time I was there to get a beer refill.  I went once for beers with a friend from out of town and back for dinner with my wife.  Neither of the people I went with were at all impressed.  I did leave two stars as the only redeeming quality in my opinion was the space. It was nice with the open garage doors on a summer-like September evening."}
{"text":"Good quality food with great atmosphere especially on game nights! I recommend the steak and calamari. Overall a place with elements of a great restaurant!"}
{"text":"I was a regular there. I've always gone back because their food is good. I had a very bad night there. I saw the servers drinking and they behaved very badly with me and my friends! Will never go back and would advice everyone not to go here and spoil their night"}
{"text":"OK. I was not sure about this place but decided not to judge it by the cover.   Is Queen's Head a pub, a sports bar (given the # of tv's) or an aspiring Leslieville hipster bar? All of the above it appears. Music was loud and annoying. Appetizer (from the sports bar part of the central kitchen brain) was terrible.   Pass this place up and go next door to Hitch."}
