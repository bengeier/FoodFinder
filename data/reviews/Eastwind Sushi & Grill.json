{"text":"2.5 stars. We've come here several times over the past few years and management is always different. This review is for   current management, supposedly 'original' management. 

I like that we no longer have to order and pay at the counter. We usually order calamari or calamari salad, katsu don.  This time the calamari was crispy but bland, the dipping sauce - no, thank you: tasted like mix of wasabi, tartar, and soap. Soy sauce saved the calamari.

Katsu don was super delicious and fresh. I was starving, finished mine and then went into a food coma. 

Staff was pleasant but the lower score is because: the place wasn't super busy (3 other tables, small parties 2-3 per table), and yet when we got there, our table was dirty - wiped away grease streak, 2 pcs of food laying on the table.

This place is closer to me than Tokyo Express...so I guess we'll come back."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for years, people are great and I've never had a less-than-excellent plate! Great amount of food in the bento box!"}
{"text":"I don't know why there are so much haters. I been to this restaurant for few times and I actually liked the food. My family ordered tuna sashimi, it looked fresh and it was amazing! Also they had all day express menu, i thought it was cheap. Don't listen to the haters!"}
{"text":"We went there years ago liked it and then they went bad but we felt they had gotten better recently until today. We ordered a roll and there was huge pieces of plastic in it. I guess the crab stick had plastic that the chef did not remove and then he made the roll and there was plastic surrounding each piece of crab with it. The server did not really care apologized and asked if we wanted another that we obviously did not! There may have been a manager there but was unsure as no one of authority came to talk to use about what happened. I am very disappointed about the lack of professionalism with this place. You fed my family plastic!!!! No apology. I am never eating here again!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love that the new owners are back!  Got take out sushi today. Spicy tuna and spicy yellow tail rolls were fresh and yummy!  I will continue to frequent this place."}
{"text":"The food & service are fantastic! My wife and found our new sushi spot. Sushi is fresh and the steak is tender & great!"}
{"text":"We ordered the New York Crunch, Philly, and ASU rolls. All were delicious and fresh. Attentive but relaxed staff. Panko shrimp also great. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite local sushi spot! The staff is always very nice and the food is so good! The New York and Sedona rolls are my favorite.  And my daughter really likes the Golden California."}
{"text":"1st timers and we will definitely be back!! The service was AMAZING and the food was PHENOMENAL!! Our rolls had soooo much flavor! 

The manager stopped by to check on us a few times and was very sweet! Great prices and nice atmosphere. The best part, food came out very fast!"}
{"text":"Super busy during lunch. They seemed short staffed but it was worth the wait. I had the express bento lunch B: spicy tuna roll, crunchy shrimp roll, miso soup & salad. Along with a tropical iced tea, total cost for lunch was $11.20......Great dining atmosphere....can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We found this gem of a restaurant in our neighborhood and were pleasantly surprised with the attentiveness of the staff and the quality of the food.
If you miss the lunch menu full of great prices, you will be happy with the same great pricing on the Happy Hour menu!
We ordered a couple different sushi rolls, the miso soup & salad (he enjoyed the soup and I the salad), sashimi beautifully presented and a lovely hot green tea.
Give them a try, you will be glad you did.

{"text":"Just stopped in for a quick lunch and decided to go for a Bento box.  It's quite a good deal.  For $8.95, you get miso soup, sunomono, salad with ginger dressing, katsu chicken, terriyaki chicken with rice, and a piece of salmon (there are other combinations to choose from, as well).  They also have other inexpensive lunch specials and terrific happy hour deals from 4:00-6:30 and 8:30-close.  While it won't have me running back when I'm craving good Japanese, it's a perfectly good place for a quick, inexpensive meal when in that area."}
{"text":"nice service and food...recommend happy hour and lounch"}
{"text":"I love this place especially for lunch! I always order the bento box. You get a lot of food for a good price and they are fast. There is a lot of variety in the bento so you can't go wrong. Then we came here for dinner and this time you order at your table. Service was not that good and forgot the soup that came with my order. The bento I came out different than the one I ordered and it is more expensive. So, I suggest this place for lunch only."}
{"text":"I got the Eastwind roll.  I figured their signature roll which was priced above the rest would be good.  It didn't taste awful but it wasn't very good either.  Aside from the so-so taste, the roll had such a large diameter, it was fairly difficult to eat like conventional sushi.  I'm used to the same quantity being served as 2 smaller rolls side-by-side."}
{"text":"The place is well kept and the food is okay. I'm writing this while sitting at the table that I've been snubbed at for 45 minutes. The waiters are all about serving... Nobody... Actually I think there's only two people working except the chefs. 0/5 would not recommend. Just go to Tokyo lobby or yen. This place blows."}
{"text":"When we first got there it took a while to get our menus, I am a little impatient though lol. The sushi chef ended up coming and personally taking our order which was nice. The rolls we got tasted amazing! The vibe was very relaxed. Blue moon on happy hour for $1.99 always a plus with me. The New York crunchy roll was really good, and the American ninja roll I believe it was called was very good! Overall we will be returning."}
{"text":"Enjoyable lunch specials and very nice presentation. I myself am partial to sashimi (not on lunch special but regular menu), and was impressed by the amount in the 6.99 order, 5 large thicker strips. I ordered a yellow tail and salmon, and would have definitely been better off with just one as it was very filling. My friend ordered a lunch special which had a roll and nigiri. It was fresh and delicious, I tried one of her New York Crunch Rolls and like the seafood salad light flavor, spicy mayo on the side gave it just the right kick. 

I definitely will be back, I have a Groupon which is good only after 3:00pm, wanted to come in and scope it out. I haven't had many things on their menu but will be trying out some new items next time.

This used to be another sushi place, but definitely has a whole new menu and plan. Definitely recommend to friends."}
{"text":"So glad the old owners are back!  It's like you never left.  A great neighborhood restaurant.  Love the food, the casual atmosphere and the great staff."}
{"text":"Good sushi, cool decor, and efficient service."}
{"text":"This place used to be a great inexpensive dive to grab a bite with friends. They got rid of table service, so now you must order food and drinks at a counter. What little staff that are still there seem to be inexperienced and nervous. Food quality has gone down yet their prices have gone up ruffly 35 percent. You are now paying Kabuki prices for no service, blah food quality, and a busted up environment. It's a real shame that this place fell apart."}
{"text":"I come here a lot for the bento lunch boxes. Always quick, cheap and consistent."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner here the other night and planning on stopping by tonight as well. We did not visit this place before bc reviews were so poor. I saw the \"opening under original owners sign\" and decided to give it a whirl. Staff was friendly and attentive, food is prices reasonably (awesome happy hours). Food was wonderful. We had a few sushi rolls and a beef dish that was spicy, like we like it! Bringing the kids next time for pad thai. Try it, you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Will be coming back! Came across this place based on recommendation from some friends. Seriously best sushi I've had in a while! I had the eastwind roll and dragon roll but honestly the eastwind was SO good. Service was great, very friendly and welcoming staff, you can tell they really care about their business. Would recommend to anyone!!"}
{"text":"Everything was awesome. Sushi chef was alone and slammed and worked his behind off and got everything out lickety split! Hamache Kama was excellent and enuf for 4. Sashimi platter was super fresh and didn't charge for substitutions. All around awesome!"}
{"text":"Reopened under original owners!!! The service was EXCELLENT, food was AMAZING! It's as though nothing changed. This has been my favorite sushi spot for many years, until ownership changed. The food and service is what originally brought me in, I'm so glad to be able to enjoy this place, once again!"}
{"text":"Great place, great prices! Clean, fresh & affordable. Favorite roll so far, Climax. Salmon sushi was so tender & the spicy Korean beef is excellent!"}
{"text":"We LOVE this place. JJ always takes care of us. Sushi is great. Service with a smile. And very decent pricing. Kind of our spot now :)"}
{"text":"The restaurant was empty at 6:30 on a weeknight. I was greeted by an expressionless employee and was seated. The chicken teriyaki was the worst I've ever had. Very dry slices of chicken with a drizzle of thin teriyaki sauce and a large rice portion. It also came with \"salad\" on the same plate which consisted of lettuce and a few grated carrots with some sort of sweet tasting orange salad dressing (French)?
There was loud pop music blaring from speakers which didn't mesh with the restaurants' ambiance. 
To be fair, they had a lot of sushi choices which I didn't try. But, unfortunately I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Original owners are back! The prices are what they were! It's cleaned up and uncluttered and a great place once again!"}
{"text":"I went there last night with my wife and we were not expecting much of this place, but to our surprise, it was probably the best sushi that we never had. The ingredients were so fresh and the rice was just perfect ( which is to me the most important part of any sushi )
As soon as we walked in, the chef and the servers welcome us very cordially. We also appreciate that the tables were well spaced. We were able to enjoy our intimacy, as well as the delicious food...we will be back for sure and more then once !

See you soon guys !!!"}
{"text":"Good food and service! Wish it was closer to my house! Went because I had a groupon, had like 5 different rolls and loved them all. Mexican Ninja, Las Vegas, Crunch, Golden Cali and Shrimp Temp."}
{"text":"I really enjoy going to this place with my buds to get some Sake bombers! The prices on alcohol cannot be beaten. 5$ for a sake bomber! Awesome! 1.99 Draft Stella! Great. But don't forget to order sushi because it is always good! The staff is very friendly and always welcoming! Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"I love this place, i go every week, food is great, nice and friendly staff. I recommend Bento B, that way you can try a little of different things they sell. 4 stars because i think they need improve their sushi ingredients. not a fan of sushi at this place."}
{"text":"Love this place. New management and the sushi quality has improved. Excellent lunch combo for 2 under $20."}
{"text":"The rolls were not well prepared. the salmon sashimi was not cut properly (A little skin was left on). On the plate with it was a bed of lettuce that looked a little old (probably due to the sauce they put on top). Also on the menu they stated they had beer and sake but their liquor license was revoked. They couldn't serve it. Finally while eating, they were cleaning tables, which I appreciate, but all I could smell is bleach. Overall I will not be going back to this location."}
{"text":"Arrived around 3pm, we were the only table there. Nice and cozy environment, The food is good, service is very friendly.  Sushi rolls are OK, some rolls are kind of pricey without Groupon. Their $12 dinner Bento is a great value for people like me who like to try many different items. Will go back for sure for my favorite Bento! 

5 STARS for friendly service and Bento."}
{"text":"Disregard the negative reviews of this establishment, it is hands down one of the best Japanese restaurants in the Phoenix area. The prices are amazing, their lunch specials are awesome, and the family that owns it is from Japan, giving testament to the restaurant's authenticity. Eastwind is a great place to enjoy a healthy meal for cheap. I usually get the salmon bowl, which is perfect for eating clean. Two fresh salmon filets, a healthy portion of broccoli, and rice. All for $8 bucks. Additionally, I love the restaurant's atmosphere. The music is always at a respectable level, and is typically Jazz or Japanese composition which I sincerely enjoy, as it complements the reading material that I bring with me. Whether eating alone or with friends, Eastwind is a GREAT choice for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Excellent place for a quick bite of Japanese flavor when out and about.  Decent service, with great outdoor patio.  Although it is a little noisy being next to the street, has heaters, and trees over your head and it is just very green.  I almost always run in to a friend there on Friday nights, which is good.  The shrimp tempora is great and so are there California roles and the miso soup is an essential for me; ) I would add more items from the menu, but it is a good size. Great atmosphere there, and your food comes quickly.    Excellent place for a quick bite of Japanese flavor when out and about.  I can't remember if they seat you and you are severed by a waiter now if you go to the counter and order now."}
{"text":"I have tried a variety of rolls and salads at Eastwind and each one has been a delight.  Fresh, flavorful and reasonably priced it had been our go to sushi place in Glendale.  Service had also been excellent! Try it, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"You can do takeout or eat in. Their happy hour isn't bad cheap beer and some good sushi. Crunchy eel roll is bomb as all hell! Service here was speedy and knowledgable. The large portions they gave were also a plus. So overall if you like sushi and want to try a new place I say give it a shot for sure."}
{"text":"Great sushi spot in Glendale.  Always the freshest fish, lots of unique rolls and fantastic service."}
{"text":"The sushi was stale, old and gross. There are no waiters, customers have to order at a counter, get there own drinks and serve themselves."}
{"text":"Long time lovers of this place. Deserves more respect! Excellent sushi, wasabi could be hotter for me. Good but different poke salad, and sushi rolls excellent.  Great happy hour menu, but after 7."}
{"text":"Not only was the Sushi amazing the service was too .... we had a great time here today !  Saki bombs....Vegas Rolls ...Salmon Sushimi... everything was 5 star .... we will be back !!"}
{"text":"This place is the worst!!! All i can say is that. Don't eat here . It is filthy dirty inside I had a teriyaki bowl. Chicken teriyaki ,with all white meat the rice was totally overcooked and the chicken was hard. The service was absolutely horrible it was dark and  dingy.l  truly can't understand why i stayed in this restaurant . 
I knew I shoulda left I only hope I don't get sick."}
{"text":"The new owners are running this place like a slum landlord. Worried now that this food will make us sick. We used to come here frequently, and the quality and value was very good. We had not been in several months, and came in tonight, ordered our usual chicken teriyaki, ginger salmon dinner, hamachi sushi. WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS PLACE? First, they have raised their prices about 25%!! That was a shock, but... More importantly: the food quality has tanked to disreputable levels. Clearly the food purveyors have been downgraded. The chicken was dried out, inedible, tasted old. The salmon was now the cheapest farmed color tinted salmon. Even the rice was hard and dried out. I took a chance and ate one piece of hamachi. They have lost their liquor license, lost much of their staff. However, the two staff members that served us tonight were warm and caring. They deserve to work in a much higher quality environment. This is a case study in how not to run a restaurant. Whoever has bought this place has no  respect for his patrons. Stay away."}
{"text":"The rolls were great! And very large and filling. We had spicy tuna, booty booty, and the crazy horse. All were amazing. We went the day after Christmas so it was pretty empty so our servers gave us a lot of attention. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  We sat at a table instead of bar/counter because we brought our kids. We ordered the summer rolls from appetizers. Las Vegas roll from sushi menu. Curry rice and chicken pai thai from entrées. Everything was really good. The pad thai is delicious. They have a couple chicken options (teriyaki and breaded) for kids. But if your kids are super picky about trying new things this probably isn't the place for them. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, our server was really nice and attentive and all of the food was on point! From the squid salad and miso soup to the many sushi rolls we ordered, EVERYTHING was really good! Tip: the rolls are large and plenty stuffed so bring an appetite!"}
{"text":"I agree with the current rating of three stars. Came here with my wife and two small children for our weekly sushi dinner. First off, just a warning, if you have small children, bring your own crayons and activities. They do not have any. The Sushi came out fast, but was mediocre.  The female waitress seemed like we were a burden to her. I get it, it's cool for 20's year olds to act like they don't care about anything, but come on, step up your game. The happy hour prices were ok, best value I found was $1.99 Kirin draft. There are a handful of sushi joints around this neighborhood, I think I'll go try a different one before heading back here."}
{"text":"My son and I eat here at LEAST one a week. Ever since they lost all their staff (and liquor license)and jacked up their prices, this place turned to garbage. My food tonight went from paying for it, car ride home, my garbage. Absolutely disgusting. What happened to this place!? The owner was even there! Before I could open the cover on my soup, all smelled was the spoiled spinach. The soup tasted completely sour. My son's chicken(?) had the texture of jerky and had to have been pretty old. The edamame was Brown and looked as though it had been frozen, boiled, refrigerated and boiled again. I'm disgusted. I've always stuck up for this place. Never again. I will never return. Years of a constant customer gone. Well done."}
{"text":"Not sure why so many bad reviews. The sashimi I ordered was good and huge. I would not say it is the best I have had but it was well worth the $12 spent."}
{"text":"Decently priced. Service was good. We tried sushi rolls only no entrees. We got an Arizona roll, golden dragon roll, Sedona roll, Mexican ninja roll and the booty booty roll. Arizona roll was kinda bland. We were told it was the spiciest roll on the menu but it was definitely not hot at all. Milder than Taco Bell mild sauce.- thumbs down. Golden dragon was a California topped with salmon. Thick cut of salmon. Fresh. Thumbs up. Sedona roll was my favorite. It had the most flavor and was a fresh roll. Mexican ninja was okay. I don't think I'll order that again. The booty booty roll was bland in my opinion. My boyfriend enjoyed it though. Definitely worth the try."}
{"text":"I was there the other night and the whole place had a dirty musky smell. I was so grossed out and almost walked out but I was so hungry I decided to stay. The food has gone down hill and tastes extremely cheap! The food I had tasted like rubber! Half the things you ask about on the menu the server doesn't even know and what I was served didn't even come with what the menu said and had to order it. I used to really like this place but cannot get that smell out of head! I will not go back."}
{"text":"I got the bento box. It was only $8.50.  What a deal.  So much food, soup and salad too.  Boyfriend got the sushi great price but I have had better. Still great value.  Food came out in minutes and service was fast and friendly.  Definitely be back."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi! Went last night due to a Groupon we had. The waiter was great and did advise that they happy hour prices were not applicable with the groupon deal. We were very happy he explained that first and not be surprised later on. We had the rainbow roll, spider roll and ASU. All of the rolls were perfect. We get rainbow wherever we go so that we have a consistent way to rate each place. They were fairly fast at serving the food and were always there to fill drinks. Even their wasabi seemed better than other restaurants. I would definitely go back as it was worth it even without the groupon. I found the prices to be in line with other sushi places."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. Great lunch specials and a huge menu. Lot's of sushi specials. Fast service and a great lunch staff. Will definatley be back. Best kept secret in Phoenix. Express lunch service during the day and wait service in the evening. Several wines to choose from, also Sake and Japanese beers. Good happy hour specials 3 to 6 and 8:30 to closing."}
{"text":"I wish I could tell you about the service here, but we didn't receive any. I was there for 43, but who's counting, minutes and after the initial drink order they never returned. We just left and they thanked us and asked us to return, which we never will. Good news we found a gem right up the road at 67th and Bell."}
{"text":"We had a really bizarre experience here. We asked if they had a high chair and the hostess said she didn't know. My husband managed to find one. We asked if they had milk for the kids, again we were told \"I'm don't know\". Then my husband ordered a drink, but they did not have much at the bar and we were told they were out of a lot. The waiter was really nice and tried to make us comfortable, because even he knew how awkward it was. The hostess brought over a plate of food and set it on the table- we hadn't ordered any food and we were still looking at the menu. There was only one other table of people in the entire restaurant at dinner time which I also thought was odd. We ordered and then the hostess brought us another plate-again not something we ordered. We decided to go. They were nice, but really had no idea what was going on. Part of dining out, is paying for not only the food, but the experience. We probably won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is so close to home and work.  It deserves 3.5 stars based on the one visit I made.  Food was good and priced reasonably.  We'll be back asap, I'm sure."}
{"text":"The food what we received of it was pretty good.The service however was just horrid we kept looking around for a camera thinking we were being punked .   When we arrived the waitress told us she had been awake since 4am and it went downhill from there"}
{"text":"We have been going to Eastwind for years and have always enjoyed it. I'm not sure what has happened recently (I heard new management? ) but it has been going down hill fast. The final straw was when I went in on a Sunday evening to order a simple teriyaki chicken bowl and was charged over $12! I asked why and was told the \"bowl\" is now a lunch menu item and dinner is a \"combo\" with a salad. When I got my to go order I had to ASK for the salad (after all I did pay an additional $6 for it). When I got home I saw that all the SMALL (4\" × 4\" container)  salad is was only lettuce with lots of bad celery- I took two bites and threw it out! The chicken was also just blah.  So disappointed.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Sushi and service here are always great, but the new sushi chef takes it over the top! Delicious rolls and really good yellowtail sashimi! I'll continue to be back here often!"}
{"text":"I have to say this could be the best sushi in the valley. Amazing staff, excellent fresh sushi and just down right awesome.  They have a variety of popular rolls but they also have the uniqueness we all look for in a family owned Sushi restaurant.  The poke bowls are OUT OF THIS WORLD."}
{"text":"We use to come here often but have not been awhile.  Came here with couple of co-workers.  The place is under new ownership.  We order few happy hour sushi to try, not a big fan.  The wait staff was very friendly and kept checking up on us to see if we need anything."}
{"text":"The prices are great but service was awful. I had fried rice and specifically asked if it had onions she said no, it was full of onion. And peppers? Yuck. Couldn't get a drink refill, waited forever for a check. Meanwhile the two girls up front were just talking amongst each other. What a bummer I wanted to like it all but didn't like the food or service."}
{"text":"The sushi here is pretty good. I ordered a garden salad, seaweed salad, gyoza steamed, pork egg rolls, shrimp tempura roll, rainbow roll, tootsie roll and the California crunch roll all to go! It was not all for just me!!!
When I ordered, the pork egg rolls were on happy hour and I didn't get charged for them. However, somehow during the ordering process and numerous read backs, I somehow got 2 tootsie rolls ordered. Whatever. I paid and left.
So the seaweed salad was on point. The garden salad was huge!!! I expected one of the small to go containers to have it, but it was the large one!! Came with the typical ginger dressing x2. The gyoza was pleasantly good. The wrapping was cooked well and wasn't too thick. You had the option of fried or steamed. Pork egg rolls were good. The other sushi rolls were good as well. 
Some obvious hiccups, but I would go back."}
{"text":"I love this place. I live nearby and has never been in before a month ago. Now we go once a week. I love the udon!"}
{"text":"Fresh, prepared sushi. Absolutely love the crunchy roll, california roll with soy paper instead of seaweed. They may charge a bit more, but it is so worth it as it melts in your mouth. 

Since I am not a fan of the dinners, I am rating the overall a 3. If it was sushi only, It would be a 4 star."}
{"text":"I have never been to this place before. I saw it on Groupon and decided to give it a try. I noticed the Groupon said \"not to be used during happy hour\" so we went at 8:00. Turns out, Happy Hour is 4-closing. Unfortunately, we ended up paying full price for a meal that was 25% off \"during Happy Hour\". Other HH items include select rolls discounted and the remainder \"roll\" menu is 10% off. All draft beers are $1.99 all day. 

My friend and I went on a Friday night. The restaurant is hidden from the street and a little hard to find. The place was pretty full but seating was available. \"Sit wherever you want\" a server said as she walked by. 

We ordered two rolls, as an appetizer, and two entrées. I was disappointed with the Vegas roll. I won't order it again. The other role, Philly, was pretty good. I ordered the curry rice for dinner. The dish had just the right amount of spice (maybe too spicy for those who don't like hot/spicy food). Unfortunately, the chicken was fried. I don't believe it said that on the menu or else I wouldn't have ordered it. The fried chicken was cut into thin strips and there was a lot of it. It was served over rice. The curry was a mix of potatoes and carrots. This is a good dish, if you don't mind fried. My friend ordered the teriyaki chicken. The chicken was grilled and served over rice and a small side salad. (I will order this next time.) Both entrées were big enough to split, especially after having the appetizer rolls. 

I may dine at this restaurant again, now that I know their happy hour is 4 to closing."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! A must go to! Really nice bar area! Very clean environment. Located off of Union Hill and 59th."}
{"text":"I've been here three or four times now for lunch. Absolutely delicious!  Very good service, and a great atmosphere!

We usually stop for a late lunch, so it has never been busy when we're there. They greet you promptly at the door. You have the option of a table or sitting at the bar. We enjoy sitting at the bar. You can watch as they prepare the sushi rolls. The inside is warm and inviting. It has an upscale look, but yet very relaxing. 

Every visit the service has been great! Our order taken promptly, refills on drinks and food prepared in a reasonable amount of time.

So far, we've had the Lunch Bento, Bento C, summer rolls, and several of the sushi rolls. Everything was fresh and delicious! They have a lunch menu with quite a few lunch specials and a happy hour menu that starts late afternoon. 

This has become one of our new favorite lunch places!!"}
{"text":"The original EastWind is back! The great food prices & higher quality ingredients are too. I'm not going to lie, I was pretty disappointed at the previous ownership change. The prices were outrageous and the food tasted off, so I stopped going. Now that it's back to the real deal, I definitely recommend it as a casual dine in or take out. The bento boxes are the best deal if you want a variety."}
{"text":"Food is good when they get your order right.  Customer Service is awful!!!!  I used to be a regular customer, but thet last four times my order was wrong and they did nothing to fix it.  The girl just said oh well maybe next time.  Oh well, there will be no next time!!!"}
{"text":"Eastwind never disappoints. The happy hour prices for appies are ridiculously low! The tatsuta chicken is the best chicken nuggets I've ever had. Their gyoza- pork potstickers are consistently tasty and set the bar very high for all other potstickers. The help is unfailingly polite and makes me feel like part of the family."}
{"text":"My dish (Salmon teriyaki & vegetable tempura) left a little to be desired quality wise and they don't cater much to substitutions. \"We don't do that here\" is what I was told. I don't eat shell fish or chicken or meat so I had to get creative. The place was clean and the sushi chef was nice. Probably a cool place for regular folk but prob not for picky eaters like myself. Three Tv's by bar help pass time and they definitely will keep your water filled :-)."}
{"text":"Here again and no complaints.   The white tuna and salmon sashimi is up there with Nobu.   Ahhh....nom noms...back to my food"}
{"text":"The original owner is back. Some good menus are gone, like Nagasaki Sara Udon and Ten-Don (Tempura Bowl), but the quality and price are back.

One of our go-to Japanese places. We are really glad!!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat sushi, quick service... the crew Paul and herson always welcome us with a smile... We are very happy with this place"}
{"text":"So over this place. Used to love it and it just keeps going down hill. The woman who takes orders could careless about the customer, they forget to get things for you like they say they will. My friend and I stopped going because quality of food has gone down, and they don't allow as many modifications to food as they used to."}
{"text":"Good sushi and noodles! 
Bento box is huge and amazing
Nice and friendly staffs ! 
I will definitely be back !!"}
{"text":"Service was great.  Ambiance is spot on.  Food was amazing.  Each roll (and we had several) were all great.  We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I don't know why others are complaining about this place. I live a mile down the road and come here once a week. Get the lunch bento, it's ten bucks, and fantastic.  The assorted sushi platter is 13 bucks. I've read others review that this place is expensive. If you think 13 bucks for huge  strips of fresh fish is expensive please stop eating sushi. I've been to far more expensive places for sushi, and the quality and price are some of the best."}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday and the chef was awesome. The service was really good and food was mouth watering. We had the caterpillar, spicy salmon, crunch, and angry tuna. All very delicious!"}
{"text":"It had been awhile since I'd been to Eastwind.  The last time I ventured in here, it was more of a fast-casual concept, with ordering at the counter.  This time, I was guided to a table and given an actual menu.  I purposefully chose my visit to align with their happy hour times, and I'm glad I did!  I ordered two rolls: Shrimp Tempura and a Spicy eel roll.  The eel was really interesting: cream cheese, jalapeños, and delicious eel (I asked for extra eel sauce, too! Yum!).  It was tasty, but it could have used a little less cream cheese.  The shrimp roll was the definite winner, but it was a fairly standard preparation.  I appreciated that Eastwind leaves knives and forks on the table, and don't make you ask for them like so many Japanese restaurants do! 

I'm sure I'll be back for another happy hour, but probably wouldn't venture here to pay full price."}
{"text":"This place is legit, a very standard sushi bar. When I go to a sushi bar in Arizona, I the closer it is to expectations the better. I don't want too much innovation so a traditional place like this is great. Good atmosphere and the only part I want to be non-traditional, not excessively loud but still sociable. Overall5/5"}
{"text":"I love sushi and once in awhile we decide, out of the blue, thats what we are craving. We have other places that we would normally hit up based on whether or not we are at work or home but one night when the craving hit, we tried to go to out local sushi spot and turned out they were closed that day. We decided that was a perfect opportunity to try someplace new and jumped on Yelp and discovered Eastwind. I really had no complaints. The service was great, the food was great and the price was great. Was it top of the line spot? No, but it surely hit the spot and have made a point of returning a couple times since. Great variety and really good happy hour deals too!"}
{"text":"Not as good as when it used to be Tokyo Express... I don't care for the sit-down style it has now. It has become Scottsdale-ized... which is a bad thing"}
{"text":"Love this place always clean,  great service my favorite place for happy hour. Chefs special brought out to us as a surprise- wonderful crab/red snapper and cream cheese bites"}
{"text":"The food is always fresh & reasonably priced. Try one of the great Bento Boxes for a quick, nutritious lunch! I have been coming here for years and it's never disappointed me. Try Eastwind, you'll like it, their portions are great and you definitely won't leave hungry."}
{"text":"There are some upsides to this place, such as decent lunch and happy hour specials and friendly wait staff, that make this an acceptable destination for a quick working lunch or a 6 Sapporo / sake, edemame and California Roll dinner. Anything more than that is sure to dissapoint anyone and everyone with an even remotely refined taste for Japanese cuisine. The sushi, sashimi and specialty rolls are generic and uninspired. The attention to detail, care in preparation and harmony of flavors - that generally make Japanese cuisine so special - is altogether absent. And the freshness, or lack thereof, is downright concerning. All of this is especially disappointing because this is such a good location and space for a quality Japanese place."}
{"text":"I work nearby so I was hoping for the best. 

Uncomfortable bench seating.

Bizarre order at the front protocol.

The place smelled like old people and looked dirty and unkempt so I knew off the bat that I wouldn't order any raw fish.

If I could give zero stars, I would. 

The shrimp tempura roll was somehow gross due to the rice not being cooked right and the crab tasting fishy. Yech 

The Pad Thai was downright DISGUSTING.

I'm
Not sure why. Too much fish sauce? COLD TOFU on top that exploded with cold water when you take a bite. (SO freaking gross.). The shrimp tasted freezer burned. I didn't eat it and they didn't charge me thank god.

Oh boy. This place is bad. I feel bad for the nice guy who took my order."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and tried it out with some friends. I can report that they have good food and great service! We were all surprised at the selection of sushi they had. More then then what we normally see. One of the great things about Eastwind is that they have all the ingredients listed for each sushi item. It really helped our friend who has food allergies. Very impressed with how thorough they were by adding this to the menu.

They have amazing service. Once we got our food order in things came on quickly. We even got complimentary miso soup and an orange with whip cream for dessert. Our server was great. She kept checking to make sure drinks were topped off and if we needed anything. She even helped us take a group picture.

There is tons of parking in this strip mall area. Only a few stops in front of the restaurant but more further out.

I definitely recommend people to try this place out. Their sushi is awesome and the service was spectacular!"}
{"text":"Ordered yellowtail, seared tuna, red snapper, and albacore sushi, none of it looked bright and fresh like sushi should be. Tried lobster roll and Sedona roll, nothing special, we only ate a few pieces of each. Used groupon but then they had to adjust all the prices due to happy hour. Had better experience when it was M Sushi. Will not return. Not a good choice for people who enjoy real sushi."}
{"text":"Six of us came here on a Wednesday night around 7:30. We got seated right away since the place was pretty empty. The \"happy hour\" is from 4pm to midnight... so they might as well say that's the regular price. On top of that, there is always a 10% discount for some of the rolls. The drinks were cheap too. Good service. Decent sushi."}
{"text":"Eastwind is a delicious Japanese restaurant with a great sushi menu and a fabulous happy hour!  I've been there twice now, and I can say that it's been great both times.

The service is prompt, friendly, and thorough.  I've twice ordered the veggie tempura roll, and both times I was asked if it was okay that there was cream cheese in the roll.  This is actually a great question to ask!  Some vegetarians don't eat cream cheese (or might miss it on the menu), and it's certainly much easier to be informed of that ahead of time than to be disappointed and upset later on.

They actually have a fairly extensive menu for vegetarians.  Vegans would be considerably more limited, but with some creativity, it can be pulled off.  Vegetarian-friendly items can be found in every section of the menu, from apps to sushi, noodles to soups.

Last night I had the veggie tempura roll and the vegetable egg rolls, which my server confidently assured me had no meat in the sauce or roll itself.  Both were delicious!  The egg rolls were so hot that I had to hold off on eating them for a few minutes, but I appreciated the freshness.  Filling was fairly standard for a spring roll, but it had the hearty egg roll exterior that I've missed for so long.  The sweet and sour sauce was different, but really quite good.

The veggie tempura roll was thinly sliced, slightly warm, crispy, and tender all at once.  One of my favorite rolls at any restaurant, and it's reasonably priced, too!

My friends enjoyed their dishes--one got a roll, the other a noodle dish.  The restaurant overall seems very accommodating to various needs and requests.  When my friend who ordered the noodles asked if the spice could be toned down a bit (the last time he got the dish it was much too spicy for his taste), the server said it could, and then explained how the spice would be toned down and how the flavor would be altered.  The result was apparently quite good.

I'm a fan of their happy hour, but it looks like they have some decent lunch specials, too.   A must-go if you like Japanese cuisine!"}
{"text":"Not too shabby!

When I'm working in Phoenix, I come here at least once to eat. Its not the BEST Japanese food, but to me this satisfies my asian hunger. 

I always get the Nagasaki. I love the crunchy noodles with the sauce on top. It's the best with some vinegar on top. Also this is like the only place that serve Mugicha (Barley tea). Mugicha is one of my favorite teas! Its nice to have a cold glass of mugicha on a hot Phoenix summer day. For all the newbees out there, please do not drink mugicha with sugar... japanese tea is not meant to be mixed with sugar!"}
{"text":"Although we have been regular customers of Eastwind, that changed approximately 2 weeks ago.  My kid and I went to get some California Rolls and it took more than 25 minutes and 5 complaints to 3 different employees to get our food.  It's not like it had to be cooked.  I even yelled out my complaint so everyone in the restaurant knew how upset I was.  When the food was delivered, it was almost thrown at us.  

I asked to speak to a manager - but there wasn't one available.

That is one restaurant that I will no longer frequent. Go there at your own peril."}
{"text":"Be aware.. The Happy Hour menu is a lie! My husband and I had come once before on a Groupon to try and had a good experience, so we came back today. We ordered 2 rolls, 2 beers each, and the chicken yakisoba. The HH is 1.99 drafts, a selection of rolls on special and all others at a 10% discount and on the menu it says pan fried noodles 25%. There is an \"expiration date of 12/31/14, but in my opinion if they don't cover it it's probably still applicable. When we got our bill only the beer was on HH and the rolls were not. When we asked the server to correct it she asked which part and we said all of it... 
She returned and just gave us the 10%. When we asked about the noodles she just giggled and says sorry it's expired. I mean get a sticker or sharpie it out if it's really not an option. 

Food is NOT WORTH full price, nor is the service. They have NEVER had more than 3 parties there when we go, so I feel like they should do what they can for business.. Unfortunately we won't be back.

Moral of the story: CHECK YOUR BILL and ask to check it's really part of the HH. What a shame."}
{"text":"If you like Seafood tacos and burritos this is the best sushi you will ever have!!!  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Decided to try something other than sushi combo for lunch today.

I was thinking of getting the spicy korean beef noodles, but my buddy ordered that - can't order the same thing...so I was looking at the chicken katsu noticed it came with rice, or, in the Don Katsu Bowl (or something like that).  That was chicken katsu with a basted egg on top of it, with onions and rice.  That was a nice way to dress up chicken katsu!

Ended up liking that better - will have to come back and try some more of the other-than-sushi dishes."}
{"text":"New owners, new name, and a new menu. 
Friendly server and we enjoyed the rolls!
If you were ever turned off by the previous regime, come back and give it another shot."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! The service is always wonderful and the food is amazing. The servers here have always gone above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of. This is by far my favorite sushi restaurant that I have been to. I used to live close to this restaurant and have since moved. Whenever my boyfriend and I want sushi, we make the drive to come back to this restaurant because anywhere else we try to go just pales in comparison."}
{"text":"Three really delicious sushi dinners at Eastwind. Fish has been fresh and tasty. Service has also been excellent- pleasant and attentive. Great specials allow you to experiment with multiple rolls. They always include miso soup to start and palate cleansing orange slices after the meal. Watch the spicy tuna- it is very spicy."}
{"text":"First visit here. Very attentive service and the sushi are very good. Price is reasonable and a Bud light draft only costs $2.50 during happy hour. Happy hour is from 4pm to 8:30 pm Monday through Thursday. 4pm to 9:30pm on Friday and Saturday."}
{"text":"Always excellent food and service, especially the Orange Zest Chicken."}
{"text":"Not a great experience last night at Eastwind. I'm going to start this by saying that I've been eating here for over 20 years, when it was Tokyo Express and now Eastwind. I was a customer weekly when I lived closer, now it's every 60 days or so.

We went for dinner around 8:00 and it took way too long to get seated in the half empty restaurant. We were seated next to a family that must have been friends or family with one server, as she was constantly at their table. She was there while we were waiting and obviously saw us before finally showing us to a table.  Our server was a guy that must have been new, as he seemed very nervous and didn't know the menu.  

So we ordered the sushi sampler for me and the Korean beef and a veggie roll for her. I got the sushi, but not the salad and soup that it comes with. The veggie roll turned into an egg roll. Everything came at once, and the server didn't make his return until we were done. After consulting with server #1, he took off the egg roll and our drink. Guess that's supposed to make up for it...."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to get dinner to-go. Very affordable and wonderful food.

Our favorites are the Tokyo Chicken Salad, Yaki-Soba with tofu, and the Chicken Teriyaki bowl. The sushi is just so-so, but as is most sushi when you order to go.

I've never eaten at the restaurant, but from what I see when I pick up the food it's a little dark and uninviting. Their wine list is pretty weak, too - so that's why we always do take out and eat it at home."}
{"text":"Been going here for years and absolutely love it. Very reasonable prices and overall good sushi. Their happy hour is amazing!! If you're looking for a quiet, dependable and cheap place for good sushi this is your place. I usually get the southwest roll (I think), it's the cali roll with sake and avacado on top, absolutely delicious :) Toss it back with some great sake bombers and I'm a happy girl."}
{"text":"Somewhere between A-OK and \"Meh, I've experience better\" lies Eastwind.  It's average fast-ish Japanese food that is ordered at the cash register and brought to your table.  The atmosphere is alright; more like a regular sit-down place than fast food (a plus).  The menu is pretty varied, with plenty of vegetarian options.  

I ordered the Teriyaki Lite lunch combo, which consisted of a bowl of white meat teriyaki chicken over rice, an 8-piece California roll, and a side salad.  They let me have a seaweed salad with it instead of iceberg lettuce, which was nice.  Only $7.20 for all that food.  My co-workers' pad thai looked and smelled pretty good and they seemed to like it.

I suppose Eastwind is a decent spot for an inexpensive lunch with co-workers."}
{"text":"If you like Cherry Blossom in Central Phoenix, you should thoroughly enjoy it's counterpart, Eastwind. Eastwind is one of my lunch go to spots because it is delicious, fairly-priced (you can get some of the same dishes as Cherry Blossom for cheaper) and has a friendly staff. 

My list of must tries is simple. If you like Japanese curry, you gotta try the curry, rice and chicken katsu dish; it's fantastic and filling. The udon noodle soup is next on my list and is especially good if it's chilly outside; and I can't forget to say how good it is with shrimp tempura added to it. The best part about it is that it doesn't feel heavy or bog you down after eating it; you leave feeling re-energized. Last but not least is the lunch bento. Good lawd, it's scrumptious! Think of it as a sampler of sorts: you get your fish, your katsu, some miso, a salad and some rice. For $9 that's a lunch that'll fill you up and keep you full the rest of the day (unless you're not human of course, you pesky alien, you).

Go here, eat the food, be nice to the staff and be prepared for a pleasant experience. It's a great place for a small group if you're into good atmosphere and Japanese cuisine."}
{"text":"While the pad Thai was tasty, the service ruined the meal. We were not welcomed by anyone and there was no assistance about the menu or the restaurant offered. I brought my mom here while she was visiting from Australia... McDonald's would have been a better choice. I'll never eat here again!!!"}
{"text":"Decided to call ahead seeing their hours weren't consistent on here vs. google maps. Said they closed at 10 so we decided to go in and order takeout seeing it was 9. Walked in and looked at a menu, the staff just stared at us and did not help us at all. They were already mopping/doing closing duties and no one helped us or acknowledged us. Definitely not impressed with the new management."}
{"text":"Love the place food is great. Sushi smells like seafood from California. Good service and friendly place. 
I recommended this place to any sushi fanatic."}
{"text":"I've been here several times but this time I roll up and see a big sign that says under new management. I can tell you that the change is very noticeable. I was very impressed by the sushi, atmosphere and the kindness of the waiter and waitress here. I'LL BE BACK!!"}
{"text":"Great place for Japanese takeout or a quick inexpensive meal.  This is not a place where you will get super quality meal.  I am rating this for what it is.  

We live around the area so this is our Japanese takeout place.  You can call ahead and in 20 minutes will have your meal ready to go.  

They recently turn this place into a sit down restaurant in stead of counter order.  If you have kids there is a window where they can view the guy/gal making sushi/sashimi.  This is great if your waiting for your food (takeout or sitdown).  Works for me most of the time.

Would recommend if your in the area and need a quick meal."}
{"text":"Favorite for over 6 years! Hand rolls are my go to in general besides just sushimi and it's on point."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time for happy hour and was really please with the food and the staff. This is my new favorite sushi spot"}
{"text":"Pretty standard sushi and teriyaki bowls...  Good and enjoyable and a place we eat at once in a while.  Super friendly staff...  you order your food at counter and have a seat... they bring the food to ya when its ready.  Very casual but a good choice for lunch.  I usually get a combo of teriyaki chicken with california roll... hubby likes some sort of noodle dish but food is good and is delivered piping hot. Nothing spectacular but it is good.a"}
{"text":"This place used to be a great place to eat...what happened? It's is tacky inside, sushi chef is hidden by printed off signs advertising sushi rolls, and the food was terrible. We ordered our standard order of teriyaki chicken and yakiniku beef. Our cost increased 50% and our food was terrible. You can tell they are trying to save money and skimping everywhere. I'd suggest to stop buying printer ink and go back to the old ingredients. Majorly disappointed as the old Eastwind was delicious. Bummed."}
{"text":"Living in the Seattle area, we eat a lot of sushi. I am finding myself becoming, not so much a sushi snob, but instead having higher expectations when I am I'm Arizona and eating sushi. 
This place is really tasty. Prices were on par with other sushi restaurants in the area. Decent size rolls. Great happy hour options.  My 3 year old loves edamame.  During happy hour, I think it was $2. 
My friend had a Groupon for them (can  not be combined with HH specials) 
I love that it is kinda tucked away in what looks like a business complex. An abundance of parking, which is awesome.  Southeast corner of the intersection,  tucked behind the CVS. Overall a really filling, tasty meal. 
They even had little clips for kids to attach to their chopsticks."}
{"text":"After a year since my last visit, and noticing the new signs saying the original owner is back I decided to give this place another go. It's safe to say the place is back to how it used to be. Prices are about the same, though it seems portion size has shrunk slightly, but most importantly the food tastes like it used to."}
{"text":"for what it is, it is excellent. Definitely a second tier type sushi place. Excellent shrimp tempura. Noodle soups are hard to find in Phoenix and theirs are solid (although the champon is overrated IMHO)"}
{"text":"Lunch bento box was great. Big portion! Service was quick and friendly. The restaurant looks clean and good ambiance. Thumbs up from us."}
{"text":"My mom and I love their teriyaki bowl. My dad enjoys their shrimp pad Thai and my sister loved their Philadelphia roll. We don't dine in, we do take out. They are always fast and have rarely made a mistake on our order. My sister who is a vegetarian wishes they have more options for her, which is the only negative."}
{"text":"Good sushi! Clean friendly atmosphere, nice happy hour prices and selection. Quiet ambiance which makes it very relaxing."}
{"text":"Solid four stars from me. Not perfect, but really good. It seemed evident that all of the employees involved were really trying hard to make the experience good, and the food was really good, as well. 

The waitress seating us was very polite and friendly, explained the Groupon rules (paid $14 for $25, doesn't pay for Happy Hour items) and took our drink orders. (Kirin on draught for $1.99 oh yeah!) 

However it took a while before anyone came back to take our food order. The menu only had a few entree selections but had two full pages of sushi to pick from. It would have been really helpful if the sushi menu had photos. We ordered two entrees - the spicy curry chicken and Korean spicy noodles. The noodle dish was fantastically flavored but the curry was good but not exciting. We also ordered the Sedona sushi roll which came when we were halfway done our entrees. The roll was fabulous - piled high with good stuff and flavorful on its own without having to add the wasabi/ginger/soy sauce combination we usually pour on. We would have preferred to start with the roll as an appetizer - not wait until we were half stuffed on our entrees. That said, the portions were very hearty for what you pay and two entrees plus a roll for two was a bit overindulgent.

The atmosphere is really cool - dark with Asian decor. Not very large, and surprisingly the place wasn't packed on a Friday night. We were given a choice of a table or sitting at the sushi bar - we picked a table but might pick the bar next time to watch the chef work. Everything seemed really clean. Even the bathroom, which are so often overlooked in restaurants, had an okay atmosphere.

Upon leaving, I think every employee in the restaurant made an effort to wish us a good night. Even the guys in the sushi bar yelled goodbye on our way out the door. It's that little extra level of service that makes a customer want to return. And we do."}
{"text":"Eastwind Sushi is somewhat Pan-Asian Cuisine. Prices are very reasonable and all the  food I tried so far was tasty.

This time we tried a spicy tuna roll to start with. I will say the tuna was cleaner tasting than what you can get from NOT ALL but several near by sushi places. The sushi menu had mostly rolls with cream cheese or rolls that were deep fried so I had a salad for dinner.

I had the Spicy Thai Style Beef Salad. My salad was big and tasty. It didn't remind me of Thai Food but it tasted good and the beef was tender. I thought it was a pretty good salad and I think it ran about $7.99?

My husband had the Korean Style Hot and Spicy with Beef. The food seemed fresh and was flavorful. 

For me this is more of a stir fry place or salad place and your opinion may differ.

I thought they were deserving of 4 stars because of the clean tasting tuna, low prices and everything I tried so far tasted good."}
{"text":"I ordered my usual (at most sushi restaurants I go to), spicy tuna and shrimp tempura rolls. Both tasted fine, but they were mostly filler, cucumber strips inside the spicy tuna roll 50/50 split and imitation crab inside the shrimp tempura roll. Plus it was $2 more for the lunch special than other restaurants. However they do offer soup and salad with the lunch portion which may justify the higher price."}
{"text":"Eastwind is great!  If you are looking for good, fast, and cheap lunch or dinner this is the place to go. They have awesome lunch and happy hour specials.  They have a large menu that includes sushi. I like how you just walk up and order and they bring your food to you.  Also the lunch waitstaff is suuuuper friendly and nice."}
{"text":"I went to Eastwind for happy hour with my book club. The sushi menu was tasty, not huge but enough of a selection to cover the basics. The service truly friendly. This place can accomodate big groups and has a great regular menu - I am excited to try it again. This time for dinner."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for a quick lunch. Ordering is kind of awkward and then don't seem like they care. We found plastic in the salad, and the rice tasted fake. Small portions of meat and overpriced for what you get. I wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch takeout today. Amazing service and such a cute place! I was given a to go cup of iced water as I waited. Again, service was amazing! I ordered salmon sashimi and a spicy salmon roll. Sashimi was generous with 5 pieces!!!! Everything tasted fresh and was so good! By far one of the best sushi places I've tried in Phoenix. Prices were great too! I'll definitely be ordering lunch from here again, hopefully a sit-down! I recommend !"}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place!!! I live in Cave Creek and drive 45+ minutes just to come here! I can't imagine how anyone could complain about the food here, but then being in the industry myself I know people will literally complain about ANYTHING. Seriously you can not beat these prices either. I don't know why they aren't busier but I'm so happy they always have a seat for me! Just tried the Sedona roll (in photo) for the first time and WOW. The lobster hand roll was worth coming back for and I had it again... Did not disappoint! I wish I could stuff more in my face. Yummo!! The two young men who helped us were so sweet also. People who are complaining about service maybe should try doing this job themselves. A little patience goes a long way people!! I love this place!"}
{"text":"Eastwind is back!
I've seen the Under New Management banner for a week now and decided to give it another try.  I am so glad I did.  The veggies were fresh, the rolls were delicious and the miso was just as I remembered it.  I will be back during happy hour to try it out again soon.  So glad it's back!"}
{"text":"I had to look this place up because of the disproportionate amount of violations on January 15th 2015 compared to other restaurants on the list. I've never been to the restaurant but 9 VIOLATIONS is a little excessive. Meh...I think not on trying this restaurant!

{"text":"Went here on a weekend around 7. No hostess was around so we found someone after waiting to be seated and asked if it was okay to sit down. The girl didnt seem to want to be bothered and said to sit wherever. We sat down and a gentleman wiped our dirty table off for us which was already set with chopsticks and napkins. The rag he used to wupe the table was sopping wet, and he lifted each napkin up setting them back down on the table. They all wound up soaked because he did not dry the table with a dry rag. So gross. Then we waited 10 minutes without anyone acknowledging us. They were not busy. We left!"}
{"text":"Since new ownership, this place is horrible. Customer service is non-existent, with the daughter behind the counter not even greeting customers or saying Hello. Only given 2 soy sauce packets for 3 meals (after asking multiple times for it). The restaurant was very dark and gloomy to go with their extremely rude employees. Will NOT be back.....EVER."}
{"text":"Ordered ramen for pickup and everyone here was so nice.  They didn't have the specific type of ramen I wanted so the server asked me if I was willing to wait so they could do their best to make it the way I wanted it. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Ughhhh... ick! Check PUH-LEASE! This place is empty, which merits suspish in the first place. 
The atmosphere just feels dirty and dusty.  It's dark and dingy and that does not do well for bacteria.
The staff wasn't too helpful either.
The food. Disappointing. It just wasn't good and I can't put my finger on why. Far from fresh it felt. So yeah. It's all i can say about this place."}
{"text":"It's fast Japanese food and it's done pretty average.  We only went there because it was close and supposedly cheap.  But after we added everything up, the lunch tab was pretty hefty."}
{"text":"These guys have a good thing going and they work it like no other! The food is amazing, affordable and the service is perfect! I have been a long time patron of Eastwind (and Tokyo Express before) and can't say enough about it. You might not get as much of a kick out of this story but I do...

This one time at Eastwind... Michelle and I placed our order, filled our drinks and took a seat. A few minutes later a couple steaming hot plates of food were gently placed in front of us to enjoy. I dug right in and Michelle began adding some of that orange spicy stuff to hers. After a couple light mixes of her fork, she noticed something black just under the topping on the rice. After further exploration, she pulls out a metal screw.

Now, I stop for a second here to mention the open environment at Eastwind. The entire kitchen and Sushi preparation areas are fully visible from just about anywhere in the restaurant. As well as all of the tables are visible and within earshot of a fairly well spoken voice.

Just as Michelle pulled up the screw and showed it to me, the lady at the main counter looked up and uttered a very noticeable \"Oh!\" She rushed over and profusely apologized, whisking Michelle's food away (with the screw) and offering to take mine as well. I declined and watched her walk away back to the kitchen. Within a minute, we hear a shout from the kitchen. One of the chefs holds up a fry pan and the infamous screw, showing us where it came from (the handle). Then he holds up a large garbage can to show us, sets it down and drops both the pan and the screw into it.

By this time, the rest of the people in the restaurant had figured out what was going on and, seeing the chef drop the pan, began to laugh and applaud. We felt the same way. It was a simple mistake but it was dealt with elegantly and thus adds to our long list of reasons of why we love this place.

Of course, to add to the experience, we not only got a replacement meal very quickly but both of  our meals were completely free. Needless to say (whatever you think of my experience), I think there was no better way to deal with the situation and hold true to our loyalty.

Eastwind is more than a restaurant, it's a tradition!"}
{"text":"One one my brothers' favorite Japanese places. Bento boxes are cheap and come with a TON of food."}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi for the price! Great atmosphere and friendly service! Booty booty sushi is great! The spicy salmon was a little to creamy for my liking, but my friend loved it, so different strokes for different folks I suppose!"}
{"text":"It was ok, but not really worth going to considering all of the better Asian / Sushi restaurants in the area.  Our server also smelled HEAVILY of cigarette smoke - not exactly and appetizing scent.  The sushi was ok, as was the seaweed salad.  The Pad Thai though was not very good.  Honestly, this is a place you are safe skipping out on!"}
{"text":"This place has changed hands a few times, but I hope it stays in business. Their Chicken fried rice is terrific! It's too bad that they don't know how to market their business."}
{"text":"Eastwind is a regrettable experience which sushi enthusiasts should avoid. This most recent incarnation of this Asian restaurant model is a significant downgrade from the quality delivered by the previous owners. 
Looking for a small meal, we ordered three rolls: spicy tuna, spicy yellowtail, and a Philly roll. 
The spicy tuna was passable, but the oiliness and lack of freshness of the spicy yellowtail was appalling. The color if the yellowtail was darker than I had ever seen before. The salmon in the Philly roll was drab and lacked freshness/flavor. 
There is no alcohol available at the moment, so you are well advised to head to the supermarket for sushi and Japanese beer for a better experience. 
From an ambiance perspective, the place seemed dingier than I had remembered, with a two story ladder visible to many of the diners. 
Eastwind used to represent decent sushi and fish/veggies/rice at a reasonable price. It no longer delivers that level of value."}
{"text":"I came here for Father's Day. This used to be one of my favorite restaurants and I never had any complains, but today. We came in, and ordered our food. The restaurant wasn't packed like usual. I got a cup to get water but then juice came out. My dad told the cashier who answered \"oh we don't have any more water.\" wow.  We get to our table and we didn't need to wait awhile for our eel sushi which was mostly just rice. My dad received his curry  rice....Worst presentation and not appealing. My sister's order comes and the waiter's fingers were black and dirty was touching her rice and tempura. I asked him if they had new management and he said it's been a month. So that explained it. I feel bad for the owner.. I wouldn't be surprised if this restaurant closed down.  It is so obvious that the employees hate their jobs. Nobody smiled except one lady. They were rude and just looked real unhappy. I saw the cashier talking down to the Japanese cook. Anyway so they close at 8pm today and a couple comes. I asked if they were the owner and they weren't. I told them it was because if they were I wanted to tell them about our experience. So anyway after 15mins, the lady stands up and says she didn't get the right order, that her dish tasted like they put vinegar in it and that  they forgot her order and when she asked about it the cashier said it was because they came in late. She ended up asking for a refund. I am never coming back to this restaurant ever again."}
{"text":"Looking for a place to eat lunch and saw a review here saying the original owner is back. They changed management several times and didn't know which one...

I used to come here a lot when it used to be Tokyo Express... It was always quick, inexpensive and decent food. Great place to come for a quick lunch. Food quality was similar to food court at any highway rest area in Japan. Then, they went through renovation and changed to Eastwind. Food still tasted the same but with slight price up, still reasonable.

Around 8 years ago, food quality became inconsistent, I ordered chicken katsu don several times and it became hit or miss. Such a basic food to cook but couldn't produce the same taste consistently, I quit coming here all together.

After a long hiatus, I tried their katsu bowl again and tasted what I remember, back to decent again. Miso soup on the other hand, I tasted hondashi, a bit too much of instant dashi, I could be wrong but that's what I tasted. For some reasons, it also tasted sweet. I don't understand, but it was only $.50. No complaints for what I paid.

This place is quick, inexpensive and decent food for the price you pay. If I happen to be in the area, I may come back again."}
{"text":"There are two things here that I love that you can't really find anywhere else. The fried rice and the hakata ramen. I know you can find fried rice everywhere, but their's is just ... different. The ramen is my absolute fave ... I find myself craving it all the time. The service can leave something to be desired sometimes, but all the servers are very nice and you can usually tell they're trying. Nice little neighborhood place. :)"}
{"text":"The sashimi and nigiri is fresh and tasty. Great place. Nice interior. Friendly, great service. Affordable pricing. Variety of menu items. Compared to other nearby sushi restaurants, this one is the winner. At the time of this review, I've been 4 times in one week. $9-14 with decent happy hour pricing and extended happy hours."}
{"text":"The decor inside is on the upscale side; prices are rather high for the area, like 2-3 times more than Sushi Catcher or Fresh Wasabi for the same quality. My boyfriend had the pad Thai and said he liked it. I wouldn't mind coming back here for the entrees, but I'll pass on the sushi. Service was average; nothing above and beyond."}
{"text":"WARNING **THEY ARE PRIVATELY OWNED NOT BY TOKYO EXPRESS** have come to this location for YEARS! I have always been very pleased with the food and the service. This time, it was HORRIBLE. The Manager Jung, was extremely rude and not at all helpful. This place changed ownership a few months ago which means smaller portions for more money. Sue was the ONLY saving grace of this place. I will not return to location as well, I will advise friends and family to do the same. The regular bowl for Teryaki Chicken used to fill me up with left overs for approximately $8.10. Now the \"plate\" is 10.00. Imagine only 6 medium sized strips of chicken with 2 huge scoops of rice. Fill half of the plate with the salad and thousand island dressing and the other \"half\" with rice and chicken. The food quality tasted the same but amounts were different. I requested why this change took place and the manager Jung said \"Eastwind has ALWAYS served on plated with half salad and have ALWAYS charged $10.00\" Not only was I upset about the amount of food for the price, I was now extremely upset at the tone and way Jung spoke to my family and me. I do not recommend this location any longer but should you go... Ask for Sue. She is a sweetheart older woman that ordered me another bowl to say sorry for the way her family member Jung treated my family during this visit. We came from Anthem and feel this just is not worth the drive any longer. Steer clear folks if you were a regular at some point... not at all the same."}
{"text":"Once again craving sushi/Japanese food but since Iron Chef didn't met my expectations I decided to go elsewhere. Eastwind was farther away from me but I decided to try it out.There was no old fried food smell, already a plus. I can't eat raw fish yet so I usually ordered eel rolls. Also got the shrimp and veggie tempura. The Caterpillar roll was not my favorite. I hate when they fill the rolls with fake crab, plus it didn't tasted freshly prepared. The tempura on the other hand was delicious! Light batter, not oily, with 5 pieces of shrimp and several vegetables. Gyoza was pretty good too. I'll definitely drive a little farther for Eastwind."}
{"text":"My husband and I considered ourselves regular customers, but not anymore. We learned the owners changed last month and we've noticed the change. The servers are not very experienced and have a lot to learn about customer service.

There must be a new sushi maker because the California roll we ordered looked awful. It tasted okay, but there was something off about the presentation. The couple sitting behind us also had a problem with the California roll. We both ordered the Tokyo Chicken Slaw and it took forever to get to our table. The chefs must still be learning how to make all of the dishes.

We like going to Eastwind because of the location and the food. Now we'll start going to Cherry Blossom more often for our Japanese fix."}
{"text":"I have eaten here multiple times and expect much better than my visit today. The person taking orders seemed inexperienced, plus he didn't know what was in several sushi rolls and had to actually open a menu to check. Since their lunch menu has changed, I ordered the chicken teriyaki with brown rice and the California crunchy roll. The Cali roll's crab filling seemed dry, and the teriyaki sauce left something to be desired. 

A few hours after lunch there  I began to feel nauseous, sick and feverish. I had chills and fought nausea for a few hours before it subsided. 

I think this place has gone downhill even though they have tried to make it more upscale. The prices have gone up, but after my experience today I can see that the quality has not followed suit.

For $10 I would have rather had a sushi roll from Fry's at Tatum and Shea."}
{"text":"This was some of the worst sushi I've ever had, especially for the money. I could barely get it down. The place is dumpy and depressing inside. All around terrible."}
{"text":"Employees are nice, friendly and polite.  Food isn't that good.  Place is clean and quiet."}
{"text":"I have gotten take-up food at this place twice within the past week. The food was ready within 10 minutes, and both times it was great. i really like their yakisoba and pork egg rolls. I highly recommend this place, and I'm not always easy to please!"}
{"text":"So I've been to this location a total of three times, and my first impression was that it was a pretty legit sushi place. Their lunch specials are convenient and the rolls are not by any means bad, the food is fine if you need a quick sushi fix. I went here with a friend during their lunch hour today exactly for that--a quick sushi fix. However, I left with utter disgust and a face of disappointment. Halfway through our lunch, the waitress (I think she's the sole waitress there as I've never seen any other server and the place is always empty) approached our table and asked us if we could pay beforehand as her shift was almost over. This was fine, and so we did as we continued our food. When she came back to give us our cards, she blatantly confronted me about how I \"never leave tip\" and lectured me about her hardships as a server that has to split tips with the rest of her employees. This was complete nonsense, as I left a cash tip each time I had come to eat there previously, usually left under the plate. Anywho, I was going to leave tip but decided not to after experiencing a sense of unprofessionalism. Do not recommend and will not be coming back. Go to Yen's for your sushi fix!"}
{"text":"I'm only giving it one star because i have to! LISTEN LOUD AND CLEAR NEW MANAGER/OWNER - THIS PLACE OFFICIALLY SUCKS!  I have been going here since it opened at a Tokyo Express (and had been going to the Camelback TE since it open). Don't know what this guy was thinking when he took it over than \"Oh, how can i provide the worst food and expensive prices\". Well you succeed. The staple of this place is terriyki chicken and rice - it now swims in sauce and you must pay a dollar extra for brown rice (she did not mention that to me when she took my order). The small salad was $1.20. Now, by small I mean TINY  use to cost 50 cents... he achieved his goal there. My daughter had fried rice - now we have had fried rice there dozens of times but this Mensa member decided that making it spicy, adding peppers and onions would be good....NOT! And seriously - the decor - OMG!!! it  looks like Goodwill threw up. i will never ever step foot in that place again! BARF!"}
{"text":"I come here all the time! It's the epitome of a neighborhood sushi place: quiet, fast, and cheap. I always get the tuna roll (force of habit) and last time I got the typhoon roll. It was so good I decided to review.  

Great for the money!"}
{"text":"I've been eating at this location since it used to be Tokyo Express. Then I saw East Wind change ownership/ concept several times going from casual counter service to sit down/waitress service to what is now between the two. I've also seen the menu change several times as well. Right now, the menu is pretty good. The price decent. The bento boxes are served all day and big enough to feed two people or one hungry man sized man. No more barley tea- upside down frown insert here. 

Came here for HH/ dinner w gfriend and son. Service extremely friendly. Even after I complained that the fried calamari was so over fried that the calamari was like rubber and the breading almost burnt. The waitress was very nice and told me she would bring me another order. Although, when she brought the new order, it was still just as burnt and overcooked as the first order. I felt a bit like I was in twilight zone or candid camera . . . I looked at her then I looked around to make sure that I was not getting punked. Lol. It was pretty funny. 

It didn't bother me since the waitress was so nice about it and I had plenty of other food to eat. Maybe she was trying to send me the message fried food is bad for me . . . 

My gfriend had the ramen which she liked and her son had the Vietnamese spring roll which looked really good. I think I will order that the next time I'm in there. 

I've been coming here for years and prob will continue to do so . . . I think though I liked it best when it was the casual incarnation. 

It seemed like for whatever reason, the food tasted better then."}
{"text":"Disgusting, gross, unedible.....I've never been so disgusted by food in my life. Ordered a simple tuna roll, the roll had a really fishy smell and the avocado was hard. One bite, threw the rest away, wasted my money but at least I didn't get sick! 

The staff was very nice and friendly but I'm not going there for that!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in town and great happy hour specials 7 days a week!!! Our go to date night spot"}
{"text":"New ownership has this place going downhill fast. I predict a closure within the year. There are five different menus plastered ON the counter and on the window where you USED to be able to watch the guy make sushi. The lights and TV are turned off over one of the dining areas because \"no one sits there\". I didn't want to say it's because they don't have enough business. I'd write a longer review but the AC is turned off for some reason in late May and it's getting uncomfortable."}
{"text":"The ASU amd Crunch roll were delicious!  Will definitely return. We always go to other sushi bars in the area, however, when we couldn't get a spot tonight we came here.  Very nice place,  great staff. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"As an Uber driver, I was passing by looking for fast food.  Saw Eastwind Sushi was open and thought some miso soup would be good.  Lunch menu included a bento box.   Very nice miso soup with an assortment of dishes which makes bento so popular.  

So much better than McDonalds.  

I pass through this area of town frequently.  Eastwind Sushi is in my GPS Favorites now.  I will be back."}
{"text":"This little gem is one of our favorite finds on this side of town! Love their sushi, their prices and their happy hour specials! Staff is always courteous and polite and very attentive! Love Eastwind!"}
{"text":"Pretty much all the sushi options are \"spicy tuna\" which was immediately troublesome, considering \"spicy\" is what they do to fish that is no longer acceptable to serve on its own.

Seaweed salad was old, lumpy and rancid, I sent it back after one bite. No apology or attempts to make it up.

Soy sauce bottle was nearly empty, and absolutely filthy.

Second climax roll is over sauced, and the seaweed sticky and old. Cucumber is dry and extremely unpleasant. I was also served the tiniest glob of wasabi, not enough to last the whole roll. I gave up after two bites, for fear of an upset stomach.

I left after canceling my check. The waiter would not bring me the manager, and offered no apologies, yet again.

I would not even recommend this restaurant to somebody I hated."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch, at 3pm, there was no one in the establishment except us until another couple of patrons entered 15 mins after us. We were sat immediately but disappointed that the waiter attended to the other table before ours (which we had a larger party, including children) we ordered the angry tuna which was amazing and the bento box A, the bento box was a little disappointing. It came with chicken. Steak, salmon. Miso soup, salad, edamame, rice and some other batter fried items, the only thing I enjoyed was the soup and salad and salmon, the other items seemed like it was frozen and thrown in a pan."}
{"text":"Eastwind is a hidden, or unknown gem, even though it has been here for 18 years.     The food is excellent: very fresh and very authentic Japanese.   Although it has a reputation for being a more or less fast food restaurant, don't let that fool you.  It has a  very good with a very interesting menu.  Have a little patience and give Eastwind a try; you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This review is mostly for the service. We went there for a late lunch. Our waiter took forever to take our order and get out drinks, the soup was luke warm to cold and our drinks weren't refilled. We told him about the soup and didn't get a new soup til almost the end of our meal. It also took forever to get our check. However, the sushi was delicious, but there are plenty of other food sushi places with much better service."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is so great, especially the specialty rolls and their pad Thai! The service is always excellent when I come here too. Everybody that works here is sooo nice. I highly recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"Eastwind is under new management & is excellent- we had a large group & everyone enjoyed their food! We had a variety of salads , salmon,sushi & bento box- definitely worth trying again!!"}
{"text":"I ordered an eel roll off of their happy hour menu and I was really impressed. It was like 4 bucks! Good mix of quality and price. I will be back here for sure."}
{"text":"Go over and see summer ask her about her beautiful oranges grab me a drink get some sushi what a great place to have a good time"}
{"text":"Came here and was pleasantly surprised by the food, service, and prices. The place itself could use a makeover, as it even has Christmas decor still up and it's June!  But the food is very good; had some sushi and a dinner salad.  The family that seems to run the place is very attentive and friendly. I wasn't at all disappointed and would go back."}
{"text":"Tried this place with a Groupon deal I had . Walked in to a empty restaurant which is fine but always makes you wonder why ... The sushi looks amazing when brought to you , but in my opinion has way to much sauce on everything and masked out the taste of the actual sushi , tasted more like mayonnaise to me ( which I hate ) .. The rolls I ordered are similar to rolls I always order at any sushi place so I know this place is just extra mayonaisy . I probably wouldn't come here again but if I did I would only order the tuna sashimi  , that tasted amazing !"}
{"text":"ouch they went WAYYY down in my ratings,

service was horrible, it took 10 minutes to get seated and it wasn't busy and there were empty tables everywhere... server took 15 minutes to get us waters, server forgot what i ordered and didn't even remember my soup till prompted that my food should come with it. (20 minutes after everyone else got theirs)

food under cooked, they served some of the steak strip cooked black and blue style...

food served COLD, not hot, not warm..but.. COLD!! gross

wasabi is the crappy powder kind"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! Been going here ever since I was little. The bento box is the best!"}
{"text":"Yikes! I take back my last updated review. They changed ownership and it's NOT good. :( 

No more wait service. Instead you awkwardly order at the counter.

Prices have gone up drastically! 

Pretty much the same menu but it tastes different. Not nearly as flavorful. My sushi roll was quite sloppy. 

No booze! Booooooo. Supposedly they are waiting on a liquor license but if I had a buzz I probably would have been much more forgiving of the experience. 

I will still give them 2 stars because the counter guy was nice and the food was edible. But it was a bad experience... Usually when my husband and I hit up their happy hour we pay under $25 for tasty nibbles and a few alcoholic beverages. This time our bill was almost $40 for similar items but not as tasty but without the booze and without table service. Boooooooo!"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi place my wife and I have been to since moving to Phoenix. 

The servers were attentive and kind. 

The food was good and the price was on point. 

They have happy hour from 4-9:30 on Friday and Saturday.... can't beat that! 

Overall good experience, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday night.  Unfortunately the place was pretty empty because the food was excellent.  Good chicken Katzu and solid sushi at a great price."}
{"text":"This place gets 3 stars instead of 2 stars from me based on they offer nice sushi combos(sushi with a soup, etc.), which most sushi places do not offer such combos. This means you get what would cost around 12-15 most places for around 7-9. Unfortunately the old saying you get what you pay for does apply in this case. The sushi is passable on quality, but the selection is pretty limited and basically just mak zushi (rolls) style. This is probably because rolls are the easiest to make ahead of time as they hold up better in the fridge, but storing them this way can lead to rice being to mashed together or drying out. The salad I had was low quality lettuce and nothing I would want to have again. The miso soup was decent. On the positive, the staff is very friendly, quick service and they have some interesting ice tea like barley tea. They also offer grilled entrees that again have combos for a good price. The chicken katsu is pretty good. 

The breakdown- if you want a quick, low cost combo with a couple sushi selections on your plate, this is the place. Of course good sushi takes time and should be made fresh so you will sacrifice on quality."}
{"text":"The speed of service wasn't what most of the negative reviews mentioned; the server however could have been more knowledgable when it came to the menu/pricing/substitutions, she was nice though. You get your money's worth with the lunch special and the fried green tea ice cream was great. We didn't order drinks but the prices seemed fair. Nice atmosphere in a nice area."}
{"text":"Nope. 

I ordered a Philly and a crunchy California roll. Husband ordered a bento style meal that included some chicken katsu, teriyaki chicken, some sort of steak, ginger salad, cucumber salad, and a California roll. I was thrilled at the size of my Philly roll when they delivered it to the table. Until I took a bite. My mindset did a downward spiral from \"We're always coming here!\" to \"There's no way I'd ever want to finish half of this.\" Husband tasted each item of his bento box and was pretty much set to go get food from anywhere else. Ultimately, I ate my crunch roll, but couldn't continue with the Philly and got my money refunded without a word from the manager.

I used to like it here for an inexpensive roll or two with a beer, but the new ownership has cheapened the name. Many items on the menu are no longer offered, which is to be expected, but it's time to print out a new one. Happy hour is still expensive... and that's just for food because they don't offer alcohol. And maybe it's time to take down your Christmas tree?"}
{"text":"We love this place for a quick dinner. The prices are totally reasonable and the food quality is really good. The waiters take good care of us and we go back all the time. Regular sushi restaurants can be very expensive Eastwind is not and again the quality is great, their menu is varied and the beer is cold and not overpriced. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"This is the deal and a very honest review no BS but the truth.  I have gone to Eastwind for years and the food was always decent.   Fast food sushi and a good place for lunch.     Well the place was just purchased by a new owner and the guy seems to not give a crap.  Never once has he come over to the table and said how's your food etc.   The people are not very friendly , and this is the honest truth.   I have been there about a dozen times since the new owners purchased it and they have not gotten the food order right once.  I order the same thing every time  a teriyaki chicken combo and a Mitzu soup with a drink.  One would think the soup would come out first but nope.  It all comes out at the same time and the last few times the food has been cold along with the soup.  Do they EVER APPOLIGIZE nope.  They really don't care and if they don't care I will find another place to go.  They just lost a two to three day a week customer.  Today was funny they forgot to bring my food out after waiting 20 + minutes.  They double delivered an order to the guy next to me.  Another table had to go up and complain three times to get their order.  It's like a circus of errors and comedy."}
{"text":"This place is dirty and the staff couldn't even speak to me except to ask \"for here or to go\" and to tell me my total. No hello, your welcome, thank you, nothing. On top of that, the sushi want very good and they don't serve beer or saki."}
{"text":"I am a sushi lover and this place does it just right! 
Not only are they extremely affordable but the happy hour is phenomenal! From 4-6 and 8:30-close their sushi rolls are about 2 bucks and saki bombers (ichiban beer and warm saki) for only 5 bucks! 

The cherry on top is definitely their A+ customer service. They are always friendly whether you are dining in or just taking out. 

I recommend this place as the #1 Japanese restaurant in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Party of 9. It took 2 servers 15 min to get us drinks. Then they gave us paper to write down our order instead of doing it themselves. We had our checks before someone in our group had their sushi. Won't return to this place."}
{"text":"Great visit! Very nice bang for the buck. Bento boxes are awesome. Nice flavor, a little salty (like my tongue is burning from the salt), but good. -I kept eating it - Sushi rolls are way better priced than I have seen in our area. We will be back"}
{"text":"Took 15 minutes to take an order.
Staff was very rude.
And here is fake Japanese restaurant by Korean owner.
I recommend to go to Sakana restaurant near here.
There is real Japanese restaurant by Japanese owner."}
{"text":"came here for their happy hour tonight and was really impressed with the rolls here :) really good sized and perfectly made !   the sushi chef personally came over to our table and took our orders, he was really nice and helped us with suggestions. he also checked on us to make sure we liked the rolls :) I'll be coming back for sure"}
{"text":"Adequate but not crave-worthy for my taste and weird discussion on phone -  when ordering--basically person on phone seemed to be completely unfamiliar with menu or ingredients"}
{"text":"Just moved back to this sound of town and it's been awhile. Was very happy to see you guys are still there. My son and I have been coming in several times a week. He sticks to his Las Vegas rolls but I've been experimenting.

I love the shrimp tempura, spring rolls, and several types of sushi. Love it here!!!!"}
{"text":"Locals rejoice!  Eastwind is back under the previous owner! Gone is the serve yourself counter, nasty 1-star food and terrible service!  They just reopened, the wait staff are a little inexperienced with the menu, but offered excellent service.  I had two hand rolls and yellowtail sashimi And they were all EXCELLENT!  The yakisoba was perfect, and the veggie udon with buckwheat noodles was very tasty!  We were regulars for years, but stopped going after the management changed.  We are glad to say we will be back soon!"}
{"text":"We went for lunch and had really good sushi, the fresh wasabi was definitely a nice surprise. Me and my daughter don't mess around when it comes to sushi, so the sashimi  plater was perfect along with the Booty  Booty roll and Eastwind Roll. Oh yeah, also had the Chicken Coleslaw  salad. Our eyes were bigger than our stomachs. 

Last, who serves 1.99  drafts?  They do and you have your pick! I think we might become regulars. 

Oh yeah, there is a Groupon out there as well. 

Everyone was so nice, next time we are sitting at the sushi bar."}
{"text":"Its been a while since I have been here, but I don't think I've ever been disappointed. I got the simple beef salad, and it was huge and filling. I also shared the California rolls with my friend. Quick and easy. The décor could use some updating, but good food."}
{"text":"Came for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. We were the only people in the restaurant. We ordered the lunch special of two rolls and one beef teriyaki bowl special. Good prices for the amount of food compared to other sushi restaurants. Husband enjoyed the teriyaki bowl and was surprised by the amount of beef in it. I enjoyed my philly roll and booty roll. Ordered mochi ice cream for desert and it was cut beautifully. The orange in the middle was a nice touch and delicious!"}
{"text":"This is a great lunch spot since they are quick, have lunch specials and are consistently delicious.

In addition to a large Japanese menu, they have several Chinese dishes. The sushi is made to order and its preparation can be viewed via a large window up front. The lunch sushi specials are more than enough food for one person: Miso soup, large salad, two kinds of rolls.

The decor is pretty and tasteful without being too cliche. There are three dining areas: elevated with bench seating, front room with high tables and an outdoor Arizona room.

The pricing can be a little high ($7 lunch specials), but is reasonable considering the quality and consistency."}
{"text":"Eastwind was pretty good, but not the same kind of dining experience as at Cherry Blossom (they are run by the same company).

Eastwind is casual.  You order at the counter and they deliver it to your table.  The food was very tasty but it didn't have the same fair as Cherry Blossom.

I would go back.  It's good for a quick meal... but if I was going out with friends I would go to Cherry Blossom instead."}
{"text":"Great find. My favorite place now on Glendale for sushi. Fresh and well prepared as well as very good service. Also the complimentary miso soup is very good and the deserts are great."}
{"text":"Food was average, not bad at all! But the waitress(asian skinny lady), confronted us on not leaving a tip. Keep in mind my first time here, and kept the conversation on for 15 minutes. Just felt like it was not the correct way to handle this, as a business! As tips are not required.. and I was gonna leave a tip in cash, but since she said that.. we decided not too, as wasn't professional at all. Won't come back!"}
{"text":"The sushi specials at happy hour are worth giving this place a try.

located on southest corner of tatum and thunderbird next to kinko's."}
{"text":"Great happy hour and reverse happy hour. They have something for everyone here! If I don't get sushi I usually will get a noodle dish, the Korean Spicy Beef is amazing!"}
{"text":"Never again!  This place is a mom and pop fast food catastrophe.  Sushi this is not.  Do not have sushi at this place.  I dont know how this place has survived.  The location must be keeping them alive.  Im sure locals dont eat here.  I am usually a fan of mom and pop restaurants but these people are in desperate need of help.  I am not here to give restaurant advice to restaurants.  I am here to warm people of bad food.  You've been warned Do not eat sushi here it is not good, fresh or worth it."}
{"text":"Great sushi and friendly staff. They remember what we drink whenever we come here for our weekly sushi."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for lunch weekly now for awhile and I just love this place. The staff are helpful and friendly, the food is tasty and plentiful and the price can not be beat! Just a really good place to eat and not spend a fortune."}
{"text":"Came during happy hour.  Prices are great!  Wish they had hard liquor but I'll get over that. Was looking forward to a dirty martini .  Tried about 6 different things off the happy hr menu.  All were really good especially for the price. I've had better and better presentation but also paid lots more.  Atmosphere is nice and relaxed.  Wait staff especially our waiter ( Roger ) was amazing! Friendly, helpful and great sense of humor. Can't say I'll be back as I'm from Austin; just here for spring training baseball .  But customer service excellent and if I lived here it would be a regular."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sushi places! The service is always so good and the food is amazing! My family and I love coming during lunch time for their specials, the miso soup and salad are very delicious. My favorite rolls are the New York Crunch roll and the the spicy California roll, today I changed it up and got the shrimp tempura roll and I think this is my new favorite! The place is very clean and the decor is so cute!"}
{"text":"We had the best experience. Came in late, 9pm on a Saturday. Waitress was very friendly, very prompt. It was happy hour, which was awesome as well. We ordered salmon puffs, spicy tuna rolls, Japanese ninja roll, and orange blossom roll. Everything was delish, the orange blossom roll was phenomenal. I never came before the management change, this is my favorite sushi spot in AZ so far. I thought the tables, soy sauce bottles and tables were exceptionally clean. Bravo!"}
{"text":"The staff there are completely and utterly rude. I work across the parking lot of the restaurant, I always order an egg roll for pick up, due to having a short amount of time for my breaks, etc. Today I called just like I usually do, I had to call 9 times before they answered their phone. When they answered I believe he greeted me with \"what?!\" and I said, \"excuse me?\" and he said \"stop calling. Come in to order, we are busy!\" and hung up before I could say another word. So I take my break, go to the restaurant and they have all of about 4-5 tables, nothing close to busy, they are just lazy. I order my ONE egg roll. Two other families walk in and are ignored for about 10 minutes. The families are finally sat after about 15 minutes when they had open tables the entire time. I WAITED 45 minutes for an egg roll. Was not apologized to or anything. It took that incredibly long to get one egg roll made, when I know those are frozen and just need to be thrown in the fryer. 

I get back to work and there is chaos and havic due to me being 15 minutes past my scheduled break time. I had to wait to eat my food, therefore it was cold AND  they made me the wrong egg roll, it has meat in which I am a vegetarian and unable to eat it. I did not have time to leave and go get another one and god forbid I call them and ask them to have a new one ready. They cannot even understand you when you speak to them because they barely understand simple English as well as them being \"too busy\" to take pick up orders. 

This is not the first time this whole hung up and come in to order thing has happened either. I definitely will avoid coming there again at all costs."}
{"text":"It had been awhile. But we are regulars again. The sushi is tasty and fresh, the adult beverages are cold and the staff is on their game."}
{"text":"Another great visit, this team rocks. Great service, great food, and the best Houston roll in the U.S. they added a fresh wasabi sauce that compliments... no, completes the roll!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for years, it had a bad spell with a different owner and the original owner is back... And the restaurant is back to its greatness!  I love this place, you can't beat their prices for the quality of food.  Restaurant is clean and nicely decorated.  Great lunch specials and happy hours.  One of my favorite go-tos."}
{"text":"Well, beer was not so cold. Soda was flat and the server said, \"he's been telling his manager that for like a month. And I guess they just get too busy to change it??\"
Really??? The Restaurant was empty on a Friday night.!! 
Sushi was ok, nothing to write home about. 
Will NOT return"}
{"text":"Great place for decent sushi and tempura. Friendly staff and always courtesy service. Menu is just the standards yet no complaints. Good happy hour and always enjoyable when dining there."}
{"text":"We are so glad the old owners are back! This place really went downhill with the previous owners. It went from being a staple for us to being a place we refused to go to. Now, the food and service are up to par again!"}
{"text":"Great family and we have been long time customers. Very inventive and good service. Love watching basketball too!!"}
{"text":"I went there the other day with my son.  We were seated promptly and there were 2 other tables seated,  so 3 tables total and 2 servers and 3 visible people in the kitchen.  It took them 25 minutes to check on us after we were seated and ask for our order.  Literally 25 because my son watched a whole episode of umizoomi and started another. Its not like they were packed or busy.  The miso soup tasted watered down.  The sushi was ok tasting. I feel like i wasted my money going there. Don't plan on coming back."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with the amazing choices, quality and prices. Very friendly staff. We went for lunch and there was no wAit. Love the spicy tuna and spicy salmon. Nice touch: complimentary desert of oranges and whipped cream"}
{"text":"We are so glad that the new (family) owners have assumed management of the daily operations. We had prompt service and great sushi!
The happy hour (4-8 pm) specials are a great deal.
Thumbs up for the food and service!"}
{"text":"I feel bad for this place, I just ate a chicken bowl and my stomach is gurgling, not a good sign. When i was here 5 years ago, the food was great. Now its basically teriyaki bowls and sushi. Things are more expensive now, rivalling Stingray, which is worth the price. The atmosphere is cluttered with obnoxious signs everywhere in bright colors, the menu is glued to the counter with plastic covering it. I felt like i was in Tijuana! The counter help even called my order to the kitchen in Spanish! Not a good sign. There were also three TV's with three different things playing...At least they have China Mist tea. It is the only thing worth ordering, sorry to say."}
{"text":"We came to this place and it's really nice on the inside. It's dark and it has good style. I really liked their Las Vegas rolls a lot. I do recommend them we win and use Groupon and got a good deal we spent $25 worth of food and got it for $15 so I suggest always look on Groupon for deals like that"}
{"text":"I went to eat lunch with my coworkers since it was a short walk across the parking lot and did I mention the fact that I love sushi?
We walked in and I immediately noticed the decor and the cozy ambiance. Our waitress greeted us, brought us to our table and took our drink orders. The lunch specials were reasonably priced. I ordered the tempura shrimp roll (which were more than one bite), the spicy tuna roll and fried calamari.  The spicy tuna roll had just enough heat and the tuna was very fresh. The calamari was fried lightly and the Wasabi mayo sauce complimented dish. I gave the restaurant a four rating only because I felt the calamari should've had a few shakes (yes, just two) of salt and pepper. I will definitely return for another meal in the future."}
{"text":"Formerly known as \"M sushi\", Eastwind has some pretty solid offerings of the raw fish variety. Service was solid and the atmosphere and decor top the average stripmall sushi place.

Unless you like things very spicy and extremely capital H capital O capital T, order the honey wings to start off with, because the hot wings ain't no joke! I like it hot & this made me uncomfortable. These were food challenge order of intensity hot wings. Adam Richman should be eating these on the Travel Channel.

I was quickly able to cool down the fire in my grill with the tuna sashimi. Cool. Tender. Amazing. Kudos to whoever does the buying at the seafood market because the tuna was melt-in-your-mouth good. Just the right amount of bite to it and the flavor was outstanding. It was also a really large portion for only six dollars.

The crunch roll and spicy scallop roll - also pretty great. So was the yellowtail roll with scallions. Salmon skin hand roll...I'll skip it next time due to too much nori overwhelming the rest of the ingredients. 

No doubt I'll be back here the next time I want a sake bomb and some sashimi."}
{"text":"I have been dining at Eastwind for years. The return of the old owners resulted in a correction of inflated menu prices and small portions. I really love that East when does not charge me extra to sub vegetables for rice in my teriyaki chicken bowl. The California Roll portion in the lunch special teriyaki combo is almost too much to eat! The salmon lunch Bento is a fabulous value. Everything is prepared to order, special requests are no problem. I think the staff is super friendly and bend over backwards to make sure that special requests are accommodated.  Today's visit was no exception; everything was prepared exactly right, high quality and fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"If I am dead tomorrow, it is because I received fatal food poisoning from Eastwind. The quality goes up and down with each owner change. Recently they hung a banner that proclaimed the new owner was back--well apparently the last owner took all the good knives. The lemon slice on my sashimi was completely dried out on one side, and the other side looked like it was sliced with a rough piece of cardboard. But reader--I ate anyway. :/ Aside from the preschool-level of knife skill, it tasted okay--not great, but I did sign on for discount sushi, ya know? All was okay until I got to the last piece of salmon sashimi, which looked like it had been stored in open air beside the lemon. It was slimy, disintegrating, and had the scariest whitish film on it that I could scrape off with my chopstick. 

I can already feel the shits coming on."}
{"text":"Got in around 4 pm , happy hour was nice surprise. Food is nice but sushi little bit expensive and taste little bit plain. Or maybe it is just Las Vegas roll didn't taste the way I like it and got used too. Soup was good . All together nice place with good service and atmosphere. Will come back and recommend."}
{"text":"Have been here multiple times and I continue to come back. It's a great atmosphere and the food is great (especially the dessert /aka: pallet cleanser). Love this place!"}
{"text":"Great food, prices are better than most places, and they have $2 draft beers. Happy hour is 4-close. Service was very good. The chef came by to check on us. My boyfriend had the Rainbow Roll, which he gets every time we go for sushi. He said it's one of the best he's had. I had the ramen soup. The broth was very good. I liked the noodles also. The pork is cubed and doesn't taste seasoned, but overall, I enjoyed the soup. The Maguro was good, great price. We can't figure out why it isn't busier here. The only thing we can figure is that it's a little hidden. We'll be coming back though."}
{"text":"My boyfriend, friends and I love sushi. We eat it often and all over the valley.  We always take others recommendations and can never find a place that has our favorite or best of all under one roof. Well ladies and gents.. We have found it!!!! East wind in Glendale has the nicest sushi chefs, great service and best food! Happy hour everyday starting at three. Get the second climax was awesome!"}
{"text":"There are very few restaurants that truly merit a 1 star review. Most restaurants have a redeeming quality. If the service is poor, sometimes the food is cheap. If the portions are small or the food is bland, oftentimes the prices are low.

Eastwind has no redeeming qualities. 1 star across the board.

Service: They have an awkward \"half service\" policy where you order at the counter and have your food delivered to your table and taken away when you leave it there after a few bites. Maybe there are some cultural norms I'm missing but the service is very abrupt. I was the only customer in the restaurant and after around 10 seconds of looking at the menu I was granted a scowling \"What you want.\" Later she delivered food to the table without a word or a smile. I felt a sense of genuine antipathy, like she would have enjoyed stabbing me in the eye with one of their unwashed forks.

Food: I ordered the Korean Beef platter. I read in a previous review that they failed some health inspections in January so I figured beef was safer than seafood. The plate sure looked delicious, but the first thing I noticed was that there was a paucity of beef and a plethora of noodles for a dish with \"beef\" in its name. Then I speared a chunk of beef and...ew. I'm a frugal shopper, so I frequently pick up 50% off \"manager specials\" at the grocery store for same day cooking. It's a risk, but typically you get a great deal on a perfectly good cut of beef. Occasionally I get unlucky though, so Im very familiar with the flavor of turned beef. The beef at Eastwind wasn't even manager's special plus a few days. It was plain rotten. It's the kind of beef that you find in a Cormac McCarthy novel that the protagonist, starving, downtrodden, maybe considering cannibalism, would still pass on. It's currently turning in my stomach. I hope I don't have to leave work early.

Decor and setting:
All the signs of a place slowly going to shit. Clearly this used to have owners that cared, it no longer does. The bathroom has that old piss smell you normally find in public bathrooms in a park, or back allies behind the dumpster at a dive bar. I used the urinal, it doesn't flush. Like I pulled the handle, and just nothing. I didn't wash my hands, because the sink looked like I probably would have picked up more germs than I would cleaned off. I doubt the new management has cleaned it once since taking over, and they're in dire need of a plumber. The menu is covered in blackouts and price changes, clear signs of a restaurant on the ropes and either too cheap or lazy to reprint. Christmas decor is still up, as is Thanksgiving decor.  Lightbulbs are out everywhere, and the equipment to change them sits in full view of customers gathering dust next to the fountain drinks. The kitchen is also in full view. When I was walking out I saw the chef messing with his cell phone, the cord resting on cutting board where my rotting meat was just cut.

I had maybe ten bites, comes out to a dollar per bite. Left the rest in the table.

This place is just the worst.

Pros: literally nothing
Cons: literally everything"}
{"text":"This place is cute, affordable, clean, and tasty. I would recommend this place for a quick lunch since the service is fairly quick and has a simple menu. Or you can bring your date here for a cute dinner date. The place is a fairly quiet place, and the lighting is very nice."}
{"text":"This was my first time visit. I'm the pickiest person especially when it comes to food that I have to eat. But no regrets. I had very delicious food on my table and amazing customer service. Denys was our server. This guy has great hospitality and unbelievably cool sense of humor. Thanks a lot. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm a little in the fence about posting this review cuz I'm trying be selfish about telling everyone about this joint..  I just don't want nobody else coming to this place and making it busy so I can come here at any time and be seated immediately..

We're Cali OGs so we're used to decent sushi joints and this place is as good as some of our favorite sushi places back home..  it's never busy up in here so there's never a line and the service is always on point..  and the food........ bomb af!  That's what they should name a roll - BOMB AF  Holla at me if you guys do!  I'll try it!"}
{"text":"Great jalapeño poppers, had the Rainbow roll and the ASU roll, both very good. Very yummy sauces. Very attentive service and nice intimate setting."}
{"text":"I used to go here years ago. My son recently got into sushi so we went for the first time in a long time. I used to get the tokyo chicken salad. They have renamed it. It is now called the tokyo chicken slaw. Still yummy. And very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"We came here with a Groupon. Looked a little sketchy from the outside, but it was pretty nice on the inside. I had a Vegas Roll and my son had the orange chicken. Both were really tasty, and the portions were generous. 

Our waitress was very friendly and attentive.

We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Eastwind since it was Tokyo Express years ago.  I love this place although I never eat the sushi.  I love their miso soup and their teriyaki chicken.  It's always consistently good.  My boyfriend usually gets the bento box which he loves and allows him to sample a variety of different foods at once."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing!!! The food, the service, the environment, I loved everything about it! The eel and salmon were so fresh and the \"booty booty\" roll was out of this world. The staff is very welcoming and very friendly. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We tried Eastwind for the first time last night. The sushi was delicious and the service was great. But about an hour after eating I became sick. I won't gross you out with details but I had all the symptoms of steatorrhea. If you love sushi as much as I do please read this article about Escolar fish. This is what I think its from.

https://globalseafoods.com/blogs/news/escolar-it-is-no-accident

I don't think I can go back no matter how good the food was....sorry Eastwind Sushi."}
{"text":"This place really went downhill in the last few years. We will never go back. Found a much better goto sushi place headed a little further south down Tatum."}
{"text":"The former owner is definitely making positive changes.  The Teriyaki combo was tasty.  I am mourning for the days of lunch time fast casual where you could order at the counter and affordable lunch combination meals.  Yes, the prices have increased by a few dollars.  I think there are more affordable Asian lunch options nearby that will be my first go-to, but I will keep Eastwind on my list."}
{"text":"The sushi here is top notch. The size of the nigiri for the price is unbelievable. The one thing I don't understand about Sushi in the Phoenix area is that every place I have been to uses shredded imitation crab meat in their California rolls. To add insult to injury they always want to add mayo to the meat. It gives the roll a sick sweet flavor. With all that said I wouldn't take away a star for that since everything else was exceptional. The only reason this doesn't get five stars is because of the service. I don't blame the wait staff I just think they were spread too thin. There were only two waitresses for the packed Friday night service. I hope that the owners will add some additional folks...or maybe someone was out sick. Either way this won't stop me from coming back"}
{"text":"Sometimes reviews can be misleading or outdated, so please read carefully...I don't know what happened or why the original owner sold one of their three locations, but for whatever reason they did.  If you went to Eastwind after the previous \"new owner\" took over and had a horrible experience, you are not alone.  If you live in the area you probably saw the desperate signs practically begging for business after most of the regulars stopped going.  I blame the previous \"new owner\".  If you heard about the 9 violations discovered by the Maricopa County Environmental Services department in January 2015, again blame the previous \"new owner\".  

But please know this:  the original owner has returned and brought Eastwind back to glory.  The grand re-opening was on 8/6/2015.  So I would simply ignore any reviews prior to that date and let them start fresh.  Because it's SO MUCH BETTER.  The prices are slightly higher than I remember from back in the day, but the quality is definitely there.  They even had fresh wasabi!  You have to ask for it and there's a minimal charge, but it is worth it.  The menu is huge and has something for everyone.  Full table service is back.  They lose one star for the service.  My server did not know the menu at all and could not answer even the most basic questions, but I hope that will improve with time.  

Welcome back Eastwind!  You were missed!"}
{"text":"Good food here.  Very similar to Toykyo Express food.  Champon is delicious. reasonable price and quick.  Im a fan."}
{"text":"Not that best sushi I've ever had, but pretty solid nonetheless. I came here with the girlfriend on New Years Eve after seeing a Groupon offer and ordered a seaweed salad, Tokyo chicken wings, unagi (eel) roll, lion king roll (cooked salmon with eel sauce), and Vegas roll (tuna with some cream cheese with a fried coating on the outside). Restaurant itself was on the emptier side (probably only 5 or or tables occupied) and service was quick and attentive. 

Seaweed salad was a good starter - clean and refreshing. Tokyo wings were a GREAT deal - only $3.95 for 5 medium sized wings along with a side of salad. They came in two flavors - hot or honey-hot. We opted for a mix of both. The hot ones were pretty darn hot and came with a LOT of chili sauce on top (too much in my opinion). I'm no slouch with spicy food either so these are good for only those with good spice tolerance. I still preferred the honey hot as I liked the contrast in flavors between hot and sweet.

The rolls were decent - rice was a good texture and not too dry or mushy like you would see in lower quality Japanese restaurants. Unagi was fine, but the vegetable to eel ratio was a bit too high. I would have preferred to see a little less cucumber and more eel. Lion king was good and full of flavor, but if I had to be nit-picky, it was a little too oversauced which made it a heavy meal. Vegas roll was pretty good and had a nice fried crisp texture on the outside. This was my favorite of the 3.

Only complaints about the service here were 1) the unagi roll didn't have avocado (sushi chef must have forgotten) and 2) we asked for cream cheese on only half of the Vegas roll as my girlfriend doesn't like cream cheese. However, the sushi chef was very apologetic about his mistakes. A plus here is that the chef seems to hold a pretty high standard for ingredients. We saw him throw away a whole avocado that seemed to be pretty good shape from what we saw. All in all, the food was decent and I'd come back here again."}
{"text":"Came back for another bento box - this time the miso soup was really delicious!  Everything else was just as good as before if not better, even the salad dressing was better.  Still super cheap, still great.  Love it!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a quick lunch. We were hoping for bento box but didn't see it on the menu. We opted for lunch bowls (chicken and chicken katsu) and chose combo option to add sushi rolls.

The sushi was really good. Freshly made and the rice was cooked to perfection. The miso soup it came with was perfectly seasoned and came out hot. Really enjoyed them.

The chicken katsu bowl was exactly as anyone would expect. It was served over rice and the sauce was smothered over the katsu. Wish they had served the sauce on the side, so next time we'll remember to ask. 

The chicken teriyaki bowl had option of dark or light meat. I enjoy juicy meat so I opted for dark meat. However, it came out really dry and over cooked. I hope this is an isolated case. I will update when I get another chance to try it. 

Everything was really good except for the chicken teriyaki."}
{"text":"For a Japanese restaurant, it's a pretty good place and for a cheap price. Their katsu Don is so simple but it's done right with good amount of rice and chicken cutlet. Also, the sauce is good enough to flavor the rice itself.

Would recommend this place for a good quick meal at a great price!"}
{"text":"Really great sushi! I'm a Tempe native and happen to be on this side to visit family and found this place. We had the spider roll, and golden dragon roll, top notch! Seriously so good."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner with my spouse on a Saturday night around 7pm. It wasn't too busy when we walked in, but they had a good trickle of patrons throughout the evening and it had a decent crowd by the time we left after 8. We had heard from 2 sources how good their sushi is. Service was very good. We ordered 3 sushi rolls and my husband got pad Thai. Everything was delicious and reasonably priced. Probably some of the best sushi we've had in Phoenix and much better than the big-name sushi restaurants in Scottsdale we are used to going to. We will definitely be going back here next time we want good sushi. 
I gave it 4 stars because the decor/atmosphere was a little bland"}
{"text":"Overall good food, but don't expect good service. I've been coming to Eastwind for almost 20 years. I love the teriyaki chicken and side salad with ginger dressing. Truthfully I haven't had any sushi rolls here so I can't comment on those. What this place lacks is atmosphere (there's no music! and it's way way too bright) and proper service. It used to be the type of place where you'd order your food at the counter then sit and wait for it, similar to Pei Wei. Employees would check on you but it wasn't full service. Now, unless you're getting takeout, they ask you to sit and they'll give you service. The problem is, the server was *extremely* inexperienced. As soon as she handed me the menus she *immediately* asked me if I was ready to order. She had *literally* just handed me a menu. I heard her do this to every other table as well. I acknowledge she was young, but if you're offering full service when a tip is expected, you must have more experienced severs. When I later asked for a box, it was forgotten and I had to walk up to the counter for it. This place was totally fine the old way. Now I'm expected/forced to tip when it really wasn't earned. Next time I'll think about getting it all to go."}
{"text":"Yay new owners are back. Food is good again! Prices and portions almost too good - makes me feel bad a little."}
{"text":"This place was terrible.  Hubs and I had 2 hours to kill after we dropped the boy off to a Gracie Game Night within the plaza.  The food was not good at all.  The meat tasted old and that atmosphere felt dirty to me.  Service was good though, but I will not come back to this place."}
{"text":"Under new management which seems to be going well. Service  is very friendly. So many choices. Went with a bento box. We will be back."}
