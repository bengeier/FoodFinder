{"text":"They boast a simple, but original menu. The salads are delicious and good sized. It's a pleasant atmosphere with friendly service. Was not disappointed."}
{"text":"Really like the food and it is close to home. The bad part is how the servers rush you thru your meal. I have had them try to take plates that we were not finished with and bring the check before we could order another drink - and not a free refill. I wonder how much $$ they lose by rushing their customers out the door.... A little hospitality training would go a long way."}
{"text":"Neighborhood bistro with excellent food (homemade soups are the best!).  We also enjoy happy hour on the patio with beautiful views of the foothills!!"}
{"text":"This is a great addition to the neighborhood!!  Staff is friendly and well organized (unlike some other local establishments).  It would be nice if the location was a bit bigger, I expect that it will be very busy on weekends. I have had a couple of the appetizers, three different salads, and one if the sandwiches. All of them were tasty and a little unusual (in good ways). They have a decent selection of beers including my favorite Kiltlifter. The only slight negative is the lack of dessert options, but I know they are working on that..."}
{"text":"First off , my husband I and decided to try something new since this restaurant is close proximity to our home. We ordered dinner and wine. The chardonnay tasted like it was purchased t from CVS. Yet, we we charges as though it was a $50.00 bottle of wine..Absolutely, terrible. In fact,  it was recommend by the waitress.In addition every table had a candle and was lite, However, ours was not.. Ummmm Maybe, because we were African American.. Not to mention,the pasta dish with chicken was overcooked and bland...Then to top it off,!!!  Our car was KEYED BY SOME Redneck raciest  bastard!!!! Who does that in this day and age??!! Really, just some jealous idiot!! go get a job and by your own BMW... As for the dinner and drinks it sucked! We should have went  to the Livingroom in Chandler where there are classy people... Instead it costed us $550.00 for dinner!!"}
{"text":"Bomb food and great service! We ordered plenty of different food off the menu, from their green chili Mac n cheese to pesto grilled cheese and a couple different salads. Everything was fresh & tasty! This place has an awesome atmosphere and outdoor/patio area. I can't wait to come back when it's a bit warmer outside to sit outside!"}
{"text":"Not the same old lunch menu as so many places. I had a grilled sandwich. Forget the name but it had butternut squash and bacon. Delicious!!!  I have several vegetarian friends and know they would find many great dishes to choose from. Also gluten free people.    Would have loved to try their happy hour drinks but had lots of driving to do so refrained from alcohol. Close to my daughter's home so I'm sure we will return many times. Not a huge amount of ambiance. Just wonderful food. That's the important thing for me."}
{"text":"Nice place. Really nice staff and great happy hour! Love that there aren't any TVs and the music is decent. Great place for a conversation."}
{"text":"Thought we would try it out on the way home a couple of nights ago and fell in love with the cuisine. The dining exceeded our expectations by far, with friendly staff and dishes that are absolutely delicious. I would recommend this venue to anyone looking for a some healthy food with real flavor."}
{"text":"Great location, just far enough from the chaos that is Mill ave. Perfect place to enjoy a reasonably priced happy hour. Everything was very fresh and fast."}
{"text":"This place is great!  We have been here many times since it opened and have loved everything that we tried.  Tip~ the perfectly grilled cheese is the best you will ever have!  The bread is special and sweet and the cheese is brie........with other great stuff on it too.  The salads are great and most items are very healthy.  Great for lunch or a casual dinner.  Perfect Pear is perfect!"}
{"text":"Great fresh and delicious food. I was very happy that they have selection of gluten free dishes. Will come by on my next trip or passing thru Phoenix."}
{"text":"Hummus nachos are a great cool alternative to traditional nachos. Nice variety of sandwiches, salads and pasta dishes. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"We thoroughly enjoyed our first  visit to the Perfect Pear on Thursday night.  We ordered a variety of the offerings and were quite pleased.  We had everything from apps, to salads, to sandwiches, to entrees.  Everything tasted very fresh and the quality of ingredients utilized were impressive.  We did suggest a balsamic glaze for the original bruschetta, but otherwise, the cuisine was spot on.  We always order our salad dressings on the side, so there's never room for overdressing.  The food presentation was very nice.  We were happy with the wines-by-the-glass and the beer selections.  There was a robust crowd and it was clear everyone was enjoying their experience.  The music selection was also fine for us.  They have to try to please everyone, and that is a difficult task when you have a wide age range of patrons.  We liked the ambiance, and the wait staff and owners were very attentive to our needs.  The prices were reasonable, and we will definitely be returning again.  For it being their first week in business, we were quite impressed with the restaurant overall."}
{"text":"Service was alright. Slightly slow. Food was nothing too special. We got pasta and a sirloin sandwich. Pasta sauce was a bit too sweet. Also they blast music in the bathroom I dont know why. It's annoying. This place has mediocre simple food for cheap, it's a nice looking place. Don't go here expecting delicious food that's full of flavor. It's average quality give or take and all they have is sandwiches pasta and salad."}
{"text":"Here are just a few of the sentences that came out of our mouths throughout the meal:  This is the best grill cheese I've ever had in my life.   I would like to thank the chef for how good this sandwich is.   I have never had frys like this.  Boy this ambience is weird.   This place is amazing, do yourself a favor and stop looking at reviews and give it a shot. The food is incredibly delicious in the true sense of those words.  Your mouth will thank your stomach for having more room for each additional  bite.  Thank me later."}
{"text":"Perfect place for people who want vegetarian options. A neat place with nice vibes and chill surroundings. Make sure to have some extra time as wait times can get long around weekday lunch times. Very well planned menu with equal emphasis given to salads and pastas. The soup choices which changes daily are good. Finally they do some of the best Mac and cheese options."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant but do not get the Mac and Cheese, I'm pretty sure the sauce was Velveeta. The sandwiches, soups, and salads all looked pretty good though so I would suggest overlooking the pasta portion of the menu if you come here."}
{"text":"A fun place to go to try something new. The restaurant itself is cute and an experience in itself. The flavors were a little bland for my taste though."}
{"text":"Great food, big portions. Amazing atmosphere, a great place to bring a date. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Not usually one to order Mac and cheese at a restaurant ---- but on my heavens!!! So good! Love this place."}
{"text":"Just came back from lunch at Perfect Pear.  Our service was very good.  We were greeted right away, served water, and then waited an appropriate amount of time for our order to be taken.  Food delivered without much of a wait.  I had the 1/2 Tino salad with the 1/2 order of Tuscan Rigatoni.  Very good.  My friend had the full size chopped salad--excellent.  I would return again."}
{"text":"My parents found this place 3 months ago and have eaten here every week since.  They kept raving about it, so we finally made the drive from South Gilbert to try it out.  it was WELL worth the drive.  We can't wait to come back- and said our next date night will be here.  The food was so delicious and we loved everything we got.  We started with the focaccia bruschetta, and chose the Philly Goat and Perfectly Peared.  I preferred the Philly, but they were both delicious!  Then we shared Mediterranean Mac and Cheese (huge portions!  We split it, and I still took home half of my half!)  and the bacon jalepeno grilled cheese which my parents have raved about.  Both were delicious, had fresh unique ingredients, and left us full with leftovers.  The sweet potato fries were so so yummy too!  Nice and crispy how I like them.  They let us try the sweet potato fry sauce that was honey/brown sugar mixture, and it basically tasted like dessert dipping them in there.  We can't wait to go back and try everything on the menu!  Such a great place, we love restaurants that aren't chains!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, soups, and salads.... Very hearty soups and the salads aren't skimpy by any means with plenty of various toppings.   Gluten free pasta is also available and looked amazing though I haven't had.... Yet! :-) I will make this a regular stop."}
{"text":"Good food, sloooooow service.  Food is usually really good. I love a place that puts bacon on almost everything, haha! I do wish the happy hour/appetizers menu was...more exciting. It's all pretty bland offerings. Tasty, but bland. The actual entrees are wonderful though.  The one consistent downside: Sooooooper slow service - I've been four or five times now and Every.Single.Time you either wait a really long time to be waited on at all, and/or once you do order, your food/beverage takes an inordinately long time to get to you. I don't know if it's because they under-staff or if it's because the staff is just not totally on the ball, but even though we love eating and drinking there, we avoid going if we have any kind of time-restriction at all. A 30 minute \"let's have one drink before the movie\" can inadvertently take 45 minutes to order, drink the drink, wait for the check, etc."}
{"text":"I very much enjoy this place. We come here quite often and always have a wonderful experience. Staff is always friendly even when they are incredibly busy. I do suggest making a reservation if you have 5+ in your party especially if you are in a time crunch! A few times we have had to wait for a table, which has never bothered us, they are quite popular for lunch! Love this little local business what a great find!!"}
{"text":"This place has become my go to restaurant for salads, sandwiches and even pasta (which is better than an Italian restaurant that is run by Italians). Personally I get the New Harvest sandwich regularly and have not had a bad experience here, and the beer menu is pretty good too. The Tuscan flatbread is a pizza that is quite tasty as well.  The only negative we find here is the music on the deck is a bit too loud if one sits by the door and the Athena's Garden had too much pesto (there was enough for a few plates) the one time my wife tried it (at the next visit we asked about it and the chef may have been a bit exuberant with the pesto that day).   The most expensive items on the menu are $11.50 so the $$ price range is a bit harsh, but the quality is way better than one would expect for the money - love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Fabulous! The classic bistro interior suggests the menu will be as charming as the place itself, and it does not disappoint. Delicious food, sizable portions, sweet and attentive waitstaff. They offer a you-pick-two option at the bottom of the menu, which I appreciate, so I got a half pasta and half salad. Even with that, I couldn't finish either dish and had to take them home. The butternut squash rigatoni? Holy cow. The classic pear salad was perfectly sweet and tart and textured. My husband got the Sicilian sandwich--WOW. We chose this place from the Yelp reviews, and they do not lie. Even the music played all of my favorite artists--a total win in my book.   My only gripe was one of the hostesses. I understand modern fashion, but with her scattered, unwashed hair half-up in a non-ponytail and the T-shirt-dress accidentally showing off her rear when she bent over, and the lack of make up in general, she took the atmosphere from hip and casual to almost unprofessional--a far cry from the fashionable, laid back couture of her peers."}
{"text":"My friend and I walked to the Perfect Pear today.  We both had salads which were perfect.  This is a family business and NOT a chain.  Ahwatukee needs more places with some character and this fits the bill.  Great experience."}
{"text":"Food is creative, fun, on point for taste (almost always) and fresh.  Love the greekadilla, pork tacos, marsala sandwich and marsala pasta, and the Tuscan pasta.  The guac has come a few times with no salt, so we had to add salt and pepper.  The service is sometimes a bit off, sometimes they just have a bit of an attitude."}
{"text":"Excellent dining experience in a very cute atmosphere; nice patio as well.  I have eaten there twice and the food has been fresh and hot.  Our waiter was excellent; however (and this is the reason for 4 stars, not 5), the courses sort of ran into each other.  We weren't even halfway done with the appetizer when the soup was delivered.  Then we weren't' complete with the appetizer or soup when the entree came.  It was only mildly annoying and the server apologized profusely and blamed himself...wow...someone that actually takes accountability for something rather than blaming the kitchen.  Anyway...I will definitely be taking other friends to this restaurant and my tip for you that might try this place is to NOT miss the Hummus Nacho's as an appetizer.  I know it doesn't sound great...but it's a taste fiesta in your mouth and thus far, has been the best thing on the menu that I've tried."}
{"text":"My wife took me here for lunch. It was very nice. The food was delicious and service top notch. Also heard they got an award for Valleys best grilled cheese. Will have to try that on my next visit."}
{"text":"We've tried this place a couple times now & it's been an excellent experience each time. Everything we've tasted has been absolutely delicious. We love the combination of flavors in all of their dishes - if you like butternut squash, pears & bacon, this is the place for you. I highly recommend the green chili mac & cheese. Normally I don't go the mac & cheese route, but it's just the right amount of spice & an elevated dish like you'd expect from 5 star dining. Service is also quick & friendly. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Get the chicken club, sweet potato fries, and green tea. Enough said; best chicken sandwich I've ever had! Also a surprisingly long list of delicious craft beers are available. Great spot after a hike or just for a relaxing lunch!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place! My friend and I are always looking for new places to try & she found this place on Yelp. Got seated right away & the service was excellent . I recommend if you want spicy get their bloody mary. So good. We ordered the butternut squash tacos , ?pear salad and a pesto grilled cheese. Amazing flavors and great service . Can't wait to come back :-)"}
{"text":"If you are looking for that unique Foodie experience this place is a must try. This is our third time here and every time we leave not only full but Wowed.   Tonight's  menu   G-Ma's Mac & Cheese (( better than Mom used to make )) don't you dare tell her I said so :-)   Sicilian with Tomato Basil Soup,, man oh man better than Than Grandma used to make !!! We eat lots of soup but this is hand down the best ever !!  South Philly cheesesteak , one word .... Ok two , \" Momma Mia \"   Guy if you are reading this you need to get your crew here now !!!#Drives,Dives,andDiners    Highly , recommend"}
{"text":"This place is excellent! Came during a busy lunch rush during the week, but there was still a table open when we got there.   Had the Hummus Nachos to start out, which are served cold (and are a dish best served that way), which were excellent. My friend had the Sicilian, which I didn't taste. He said it was really good and not as heavy as he thought it would be.   I had the Pesto grilled cheese. Pesto is one of my favorite things in the world and this did not disappoint! After eating a ton of the Nachos, I had to force myself to only eat half of this sandwich to avoid food coma. Took the rest home and enjoyed it cold that night.   Can't wait to come back here many times and try more things on the menu!"}
{"text":"We love coming here, particularly for lunch.  It's fresh and much care is put into every dish.  The sweet potato fries are the best anywhere.  The soups are fresh and they have many different types of grilled cheese.  One particular is served on a pear bread that is amazing!  The kids menu is even good.  Not that substituted junk food many restaurants will skimp on when it comes to the kids menu.  Only one thing I would change is they serve an amazing peach/pear cobbler and the fruit is very skimpy.  It needs more fruit and less topping.  You kind of have to dig around to find any fruit.  Maybe it's because the time of year and they will add more fruit around summer.  Not sure... But this place is still a 5 star!"}
{"text":"An amazing find. Great food and super friendly service. The bacon jalapeño grilled cheese was one of the top two grilled cheese I've ever had. The sweet potato fries were on point. The beer selection was decent too. Also, the pear cobler is a must."}
{"text":"Wow, what great addition to Ahwatukee. The the service and food was very good. I enjoyed a Pesto Chicken Sandwich, my wife had a fantastic salad. They extended the patio which is very nice at this time of the year. We will definitely go back..."}
{"text":"The food here is good enough for a four, so I'll give four stars. Service gets two stars, because a not very busy waitress in the mostly empty restaurant wouldn't acknowledge my wife or daughter's need for a refill on their drinks until the check arrived after a long wait."}
{"text":"I love the food here (salads are amazing) and I am so happy to have this cute place tucked back in Ahwatukee. Service can be very slow so I usually only do when I know I have some extra time. One suggestion would be to make the soup a little thicker/creamier- a little thin for my tastes."}
{"text":"One of our new favorite spots!  Great service and excellent food.  Everything we ordered was very tasty and fresh.  My fiancée called the grilled cheese \"decadent\".  We also ordered the pear of tomatoes pasta and the perfect pear classic salad, both were fantastic!  Patio allows dogs and they even hooked us up with a water bowl for our pup."}
{"text":"Great happy hour (11a to 6p), great food (huge salads, fresh ingredients, house-made dressings, lots of options), decent if small beer selection; inconsistent service. On a slow Tuesday we received very attentive service indoors; on a busy Wednesday (1 day later) we sat on the Patio for 20 minutes before anyone took our order; we ended up ordering takeout.  Worth a trip but be prepared to wait if it's busy."}
{"text":"Amazing! Last night was the first time we ate there! Everything was so delicious! It's so fun getting to eat yummy gluten free items! I had the pesto grilled cheese on the gluten free bread and a taste of the gluten free GMA Mac n Cheese! Andrea was a server and she was fantastic! So friendly and so attentive! This is my new favorite dinner spot!"}
{"text":"Yelp delivers on this place.  We needed somewhere to eat and had to arrive 30 minutes before closing.  The service was very friendly and not rushed even though we needed to be there past closing.    We ordered the pear salad to share and they split it for us without asking, another plus for good service.   The salad was delicious and a great mix of ingredients.  For the main course we both tried different grilled cheese.  We decided on the butternut squash and the 4 cheese brie  (sorry don't remember the fancy names) .  They were both quite flavorful and I love their bread selections.  The food and menu are both worth your time.    The place claims to be a wine bar but I'm not convinced they have the right ambiance for that.  It's the old NYPD pizza place and while the place looks quite nice I'm not sure I think of wine bar when entering.    I'll definitely be a return visitor for the food alone."}
{"text":"Second time here and both times the food was great. Tried the Pesto Grilled Cheese and it was delish!!! I can't wait to try more menu items!"}
{"text":"Decent food - we had the Sunday brunch.  I was looking forward to the Big Country burrito but it's not available at the Ahwatukee location. The manager said the Tempe location offers some different menu items. I'm more of a meat and potatoes breakfast eater.  Perfect Pear is very nice, but I doubt I will go back.  It's more casual bistro than a true breakfast stop.  But the food was good and the prices were fair."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate at the Ray Rd & Priest, Tempe location yesterday at the recommendation of my daughter who highly recommended it. I had a hard time choosing between the salads since they all had such great combinations of fresh vegetables, but settled on Fall Leaves. This probably is the best salad I have ever eaten anywhere. Everything was fresh, crisp, and crunchy. My husband chose a great BLTA sandwich which was very well prepared. I am anxious to try their other menu items so we will definitely be returning to the Perfect Pear often.  We are so glad we found a restaurant with a flare for the unique!"}
{"text":"I've been dreaming of this place since I went there for the first time last weekend.  Creative menu, delicious food, and hip atmosphere. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and drinks.... And 2pm to 6pm delicious tapas!!! Daily happy hour is 11am to 6pm !! Perfectly grilled cheese is sooooo good ! Green chile dip was a great appetizer as well! Everything is fresh and tasty! Very extensive menu with something for everyone even the picky eaters.... You know who you are . Great atmosphere nice and clean with great music playing . You feel very peaceful while here so it is sure to not disappoint! .... Are you in the car yet? You should be! The owners put a lot of care into this place and it is obvious the second you walk in the door , service was pleasant and also fast"}
{"text":"Ate here with my wife a few days ago for dinner. The place wasn't that busy, so we thought it would be a quick eat. Nobody greeted us at the door so we sat at the bar. The bartender didn't acknowledge us and walked away, we sat there for 10 minutes before a server came back and greeted us. We were about to leave, but decided to give them a shot. The food was good, service was sub par. There's  25% chance I would come back for lunch."}
{"text":"Went there for happy hour, has great service and food/drinks were very good!  Ambience was nice!"}
{"text":"Went for happy hour, great food and wine! Nice and relaxing setting as well. Will be back!"}
{"text":"This was my third time here. A little disappointing this time. Apparently my server was more interested in her phone than refilling my iced tea. Had the chicken club. The ciabatta bread was dry and cold. Not toasted or grilled. Will be back but this time was not very good. Almost $27 for lunch and as I'm typing this my credit card is just sitting here waiting to be picked up. Where are you Elyse? Get off your phone and cash me out."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh. The Chicken Masala Sandwich is awesome. Started with a bowl of Cream of Asparagus Soup."}
{"text":"Wonderful new restaurant.  Great atmosphere inside and also has a spacious patio which will be perfect with the weather cooling down now. The entire staff was friendly and welcoming, and we received fast service with great recommendations on the food. Both our appetizer and my entree were delicious, and I can't wait to come back to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by for a late lunch/snack on a saturday. We were pleasantly surprised to learn that they had happy hour going on. We ordered a couple of appetizers and an entrée. The food was great. However I wish I could say the same about the service.  We were rushed out of there and I'm not sure why as the restaurant was not overly busy. The server was rude, abrupt and quick to tap us out after just 1 drink each. She was rushing us from the beginning and seemed rather irritated that we didn't know what we were having after just seconds of sitting down. About half way through our meal, instead of asking if we needed another drink she brought out the check (as we were still eating and had food on our plates!)."}
{"text":"I would totally recommend the bacon jalapeño grilled cheese.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"Yum, I love this place! The salads are huge! Many healthy options here. Peach lavender iced tea, pulled pork tacos, and house pear salad is great. Went twice in one week. Will be back! Just wish it was closer to home :) Check this one out of you want something delicious but healthy. Also very dog friendly!"}
{"text":"Still finishing our happy hour drinks. Had great food and service. It's not busy so I can't speak to how things are when it's \"slammed\" but we are very happy with our experience."}
{"text":"Excellent service.  Great food selection. More unique choices. Happy hour starts at 11am every day! Pretty covered patio."}
{"text":"Got to enjoy this place on a recent trip to Phoenix. It was one of the few restaurants open on New Years Day!  I had the house guacamole, the fall leaves salad wrap, and for dessert the apple &a peach cobbler. The guacamole was delicious and chunky, the wrap's dressing tasted a little off but I think that was just my personal preference for its flavor. But, OH MY GOSH. The cobbler was so so so fantastic.. I highly recommend it!   The atmosphere was also enjoyable. It's a quiet place, the wait staff were pleasant and attentive, and the decor fits in with its vibe. Overall, if I ever return to Phoenix, I'll push to return to this place. It's definitely worth a stop in."}
{"text":"Finally! A good, healthy bistro in the neighborhood that's not a sports bar! We had a late lunch for the first time there recently. I was pleasantly surprised....great service and the food was really, really good. Creative, fresh menu with lots of light options. Perfect for lunch or weekend brunch!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here with my family since the grand opening and I've always loved the place and  gotten the same dish. Tonight my family and I came in for our weekly family dinner and ended up wasting money and going home hungry. Tonight I received that same dish and It was served to me watered down and completely different. I rarely do this but I ended up a sending it back and I asked to bring it out in a to go box since my family had already eaten. I received it in a to go box exactly the way I sent it back. Cold, different and gross....although this time the water was drained from the pasta. Any idiot could see it was the same garbage I had just sent back. Anyway. I'm super bummed to say that I won't be coming here anymore. You couldn't fix my food and my wife couldn't even get the beer she wanted or a drink that didn't taste like cough medicine. Food sucked. Service was aaaiiiiight, and the ability to think quick and resolve a problem was completely absent. Bummed out and wasted money."}
{"text":"I would have liked to give Perfect Pear more stars, but just felt like I could not do so.   My friend and I went to lunch on Friday.   We arrive around 12:30 pm and did not get lunch until around 1:20 pm.  Yet the table next to us came in around 1:10 pm and got all their meals around 1:30 pm.   The food was great, but to wait almost an hour is just not acceptable.  I think I will return for lunch, but would hope management, knowing someone waited so long (Owner stopped by our table and apologize telling us we came in at the tail end of lunch) would have at least compensated the ice tea.   Also, the dining room is too dark and needs more natural light."}
{"text":"I wanted so badly to have a good experience at Perfect Pear because I went to the one on Chanler Blvd and had a 40 minute wait and could not give it a good review.   This time my husband & I went for lunch.   Place was not crowded and they had two servers.  I had a salad and honestly the greens were dripping with dressing.  The pears, sunflower seeds and quinoa  were non existant but cranberries were generous.  I left more than half of my salad and waiter just asked me if I wanted a doggy bag.  I told him it was way too wet, but got no reaction.   My husband had the Silian sandwich and said it was too salty and cheese over powered the whole sandwich.  His sweet potato fries were too hard.  We probably will not return.  Makes me sad."}
{"text":"What an amazing bistro! The staff is kind and attentive, the food is worth every bite, and their only dessert is the best cobbler I've ever had! We did the soup combo: mushroom & Brie soup with the Baja lime salad. My fiancé got the green chili with creamy mushroom Marsala.   Everything finger licking delicious!!"}
{"text":"Wow.  Will we be back?  You betcha we'll be back, and with others.  And the real good news is, we just moved real close to where we could actually walk there.  Nice job, owners of Perfect Pear.  You should have a less expensive set of house wines though.  Pita Jungle has you beat by a mile in that category.  Come up with a decent $3 a glass set-up and watch your traffic.  The lost leader wine will pay for itself real quick."}
{"text":"This place is fresh, unique, affordable and delicious! Perfect for lunch.  Get the grilled cheese with the pear bread!"}
{"text":"Best tacos in town! The waitresses were so wonderful, so friendly, all of them were the best not only my server. Such a warming atmosphere, I'm so glad I decided to eat at the perfect pear!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, great beer and wine selection.   A little disorganized at times, but it's never been so bad we wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"You can not go here just one time....looking at the menue, my wife and I will be back at LEAST five times, so we can try more of the menue.  I had the pear bread french toast and sausage (not on the menue)....very, very nice indeed....not sure who came up with pear bread, but bless them.  Wife had Southwest Philly (comes on a ciabatta roll), again terrific, especially with the sweet potatoes fries....The latter are hard to do well but Chris, the owner, has definitely figured it out, with just a touch of crunch.  Hey, we'll definitely be coming back to this local, excellent restsurant."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch with my sisters! We shared a couple different things and had more than enough food! We even had leftovers and that never happens!!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch or dinner.  If you hate pears, don't worry.  There is plenty on the menu for you.      Wonderful salads and sandwiches.  I could eat here every day!"}
{"text":"So, disappointing, I can't tell you. I live in walking distance and wanted for months to stop in. I finally walked in yesterday (Sunday) at around 4:00pm. Sat outside on the patio overlooking the parking lot and road. Ever since My Big Fat Greek Restaurant closed near by, I've been desperate for a consistent \"go to\" for noshing and drinks. Perfect Pear is a faux bistro with no bar, no charm and zero ambience. The restaurant smelled like smelly cheese - maybe cheap grated romano - so the patio was the escape. The menu offers typical easy-to-make, low risk, but high profit dishes. The drink menu is pedestrian and boring. No buttery chards and warm room temp reds. The waitress thought Pinot Gris was a misprint and apologized !?! So, the foodie in me already knows the pasta selections are embarrassingly ill conceived, so think American corporate like Chili's or Carraba's. So, what to do? Well, order something that few restaurants can screw up --- bruschetta!!  Trendy, high profit, easy with fresh ingredients. The Classic came on soggy focaccia, hardly toasted, with tasteless, off-red tomatoes with red onion and julienne'd basil (not torn). Then, (get this) topped with cheap-of-the-cheap romano cheese (see above). Any shot at being edible was ruined by the grated romano. The Chef must have zero culinary instincts or just doesn't care because there is no real competition in the area. Unforgiveable. The Lolita was actually worse. Please don't say \"avocado\" when you really mean a brown guac spread. We ordered the olives and pesto goat cheese. Why ruin pesto with goat cheese? The crostini with the olives was the best part of the meal. My partner reconstructed the bruschetta using the crostini and the edible parts of what was served. I marvel at new owners who seemingly don't avail themselves of the basic \"how to's\" and \"do's and dont's\" of culinary.   Please -- owner and chef -- do a dine around in Phoenix, take the entire week and then re-vamp your concept and menu. I'll be back in (3) months because I refuse to go to Native New Yorker. I'm serious.   Much luck.   D"}
{"text":"The food is fresh and very good.  The atmosphere is pleasant,  happy hour ended at 6 so we just missed the specials.  I would come again."}
{"text":"Perfect Pear just opened its 2nd location right up the street from me. I've gone in a couple times for lunch and enjoyed it every time. They have a good sized menu with something to please anyone! I'm working my way through the grilled cheese section, so good! The soup du jour last time was mushroom brie and was really creamy with a ton of mushrooms! Place is cute and service always pleasant. Hope they can keep expanding!"}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday about noon for the first time. Nice and welcoming atmosphere, very interesting menu.  Had the warm bree and bacon app, Bree and jalapeño melted sandwich , with a beef chili side.  The app didn't even look good, too much grease, and too much brown sugar on the whole thing, that I couldn't taste the Bree.  My sandwich had too much jalapeño's, big thick slices, again covering up the flavor of the Bree.  The chili side tasted like it came out of a can and had no flavor.  Maybe an off day ? IDK, willing to give it another try."}
{"text":"We were starving when we landed at the airport and were lucky to find this cute place on yelp! Food was fresh and delicious! We had soup, salads, flatbread and blt and all were so good! They also have really good iced tea. It was our waiters first day but he was so friendly and gave us great service! Everything was excellent!!"}
{"text":"We love this place...Food has always been amazing and fresh. Staff is ok as well but my most favorite thing is a short menue..For me when I eat out this means the restaurant usually does really well because they can be awesome at a few things rather than a whole bunch of stuff wich usually turns just ok or not at all.."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants for sandwiches. Well portioned, reasonably priced yummy sandwiches that treat you to an explosion of flavors! Been to 2 of their locations so far and came off wanting to go back each time. Great ambiance and courteous staff. Way to go!"}
{"text":"High quality sit down restaurant. The atmosphere at night is very beautiful and the food quite delectable. I hope I can come back in the future."}
{"text":"Not so perfect portions.  Ordered soup to go last night, the same as I have done 2 previous times, at $5 a pop you would expect a full container as per the previous visits, but no, under half the usual amount, it was clear from the mess down the side of the to go container that soup had been poured out.....  If portion sizes are being reduced and they are still charging the same price, we will not be back  Soup by the way, was excellent, what a shame.  April 2014 update : photo of half empty soup container was deleted by Yelp."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch...what a mistake. I got french toast which was raisin bread-not good raisin bread just out of the bag. Like Wonder Raisin Bread, no breakfast meat so they brought me bacon crumbles in a bowl...but no bacon in the place? NOT a good meal. Service was terrible almost like they didn't know they were going to open that day. Terrible disappointment."}
{"text":"My first time here & really enjoyed the modern rustic decor. The star is the food! I consider myself a foodie & the food did not disappoint! I had the wild chop salad with grilled shrimp. My daughter had creamy butternut rigatoni with added sausage. Yummy to say the least!"}
{"text":"Go to this restaurant asap. It's a great spot with seriously good food, and could use the support of the neighborhood. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Maybe the best lunch I have had in quite some time! Soups, sandwiches, everything was outstanding!!! 5 star for sure as well as great service in a great setting!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!!!  I wish I could comment on the food, but we never had the opportunity to try it. We walked in and were greeted by the bartender informing us to sit where we'd like. Well, we did so and waited 20 minutes without being acknowledged and even grabbed our own menus. Upon walking out, we were finally recognized by an employee saying \"oh sorry\" while another server sat texting on her phone. Above and beyond all of this, the tables were nasty and dirty."}
{"text":"This restaurant very suddenly became my *favorite* place to eat! The food is delicious and creative, and the service was fantastic. I'm already planning on hosting a baby shower there in the New Year. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Over rated place  My salmon salad wasn't great  And the salmon was so overlooked it was dare and rubbery like they microwave reheated cooked salmon.  The service was very slow too.  This is definitely not a 4.5 star place."}
{"text":"this is the best food in the area for sure, they have great natural ingredients, everything tasted great."}
{"text":"I went to the Perfect Pear Bistro because they are right around the corner from my home and I like to support local businesses.  Unfortunately,  I was completely ignored when I walked in even though the place was empty except for one couple at the bar. The bartender continued his conversation with the couple and barely seemed to notice me. The lady he was talking to motioned him to service me, but a waitress happened to be coming out of the back and finally acknowledged me and took my order. I sat at the bar while waiting for my order. I was never asked if I wanted a drink or acknowledged by the bartender, who continued. His conservation with the couple. Again, the lady motioned for him to service me and he disregarded her and continued his conversation. I sat for 20 minutes waiting for my food without so much as a nod from the bartender.  I have never been treated so uninvited by a place that wants me to spend my money. The only reason I am giving 2 stars is because the waitress was nice and the food was good. I hope it wasn't my skin color that made the bartender pretend not to see me."}
{"text":"Great place for healthier food and great ambiance and service. We have gone twice and both experiences were wonderful. They have a great variety of salads, which the perfect salad blend is an excellent choice. The salads are larger and have the right amount of toppings w/option of chicken of salmon on them. We also tried the bruschetta, which was ok. We were expecting them to be toastier or warm, but still fresh toppings. I hope they do well, cause this will be a regular place for us."}
{"text":"We went here last night to give it another go, and grab a few beers. The service was excellent and the food was great, with good prices as well. While there was still a mix up this time (wrong cheese in a wrap), the problem was promptly fixed- they even let us keep the mess up wrap and gave us extra fresh fries. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"This is the perfect place for family and friends to gather for lunch or dinner. Their menu is unique and fresh. The staff is always very accommodating and friendly. I have had several great meals here and the portions are generous. When looking for a new place to try-don't leave out The Perfect Pear!"}
{"text":"Almost. This place is an almost. It's almost really good. We have been there a couple of times. The menu looks good but the food never lives up to my expectation. They have been out of things several times. The service is ok and my toddler liked the sweet potato fries a lot so there's that. I'll give it another chance."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the good is very good, almost fantastic. We were greeted right away by the manager she even open the door for us then seated and waited 10 minutes for menus another 10 minutes for drinks and 30 minutes or incomplete orders. everything would be fantastic at this restaurant minus the service.  the teenage kids cooking in the kitchen do not pay enough attention to the tickets and food was consistently wrong it's unfortunate because it would be a fantastic restaurant."}
{"text":"Loved the menu; very interesting and creative combinations of ingredients and flavors.  Sat outside on the covered patio on a perfect day, and we tried a great salad, a mushroom-brie soup, and one of their famous loaded grilled cheese sandwiches.  All was delicious.  Highly recommend this for a casual, tasty experience."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast and ti was wonderful, I enjoyed a mimosa and some incredible pear French toast.  Service was very good, I will definitely come here again"}
{"text":"Food was excellent ( I got a quinoa bowl) and the service was also great. I will go back here again. They had a huge menu and this was my first time here so I am looking forward to going back and trying other things"}
{"text":"First time and have to say my friends and I will be frequenting this place often.   The menu is simple , straight forward and offered up some ideas for cooking at home with healthy ingredients.    Each of the items we ordered brought up the \"hmmm\" deep in our bellies.  For starters soup:  I had the asparagus and my friends had the thai chicken coconut Curry.   The asparagus was average with just a hint of heat.  my friends downed their soup with many \"hmms\" in between bites.     next I had the Cuban Sandwich which had great textures: crunch from the dill pickles and toasted marble rye; burst of flavor dijon mustard; and savory roasted slices of pork; melted cheese If I remember correctly pepper Jack.   one of my friends Had one of the grilled cheese sandwiches....great with soup on a Fall day.   My other friend had a green salad (choice of greens) with Quinoa, beets, you name it!   A fairly large portion at that...lunch for tomorrow."}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place. Heard so many good things from others who have gone. Decided to go on a Saturday at 5pm ahead of any night time crowd. Place was half empty and when we were seated, we indicated that we had to be out by 6pm so that we could get to an event. Setting expectations with the server ... Right? Started off with the server getting the drinks all wrong ... Not good. We ordered two sandwiches, knowing they could be made in short order, light fare and we could be on our way. Three refills later on my beverage which we had to struggle to get, and our sandwiches arrived. It was now 550pm. We immediately asked for the check. It was hard to find the piece of chicken on the ridiculously large ciabatta bread. Wow ... You can get a $9 sandwich here, just do not expect much on it.  We actually had to wave our hands in the air to get the attention of the server to take our credit card so we could get out. Which happened at 615pm. We would have been better off ordering from Dominos or Macdonalds which are right next door.  Up your game in a big way if you want me back. WAY too many other good places around to have to settle for an experience like that."}
{"text":"Solid dishes, nice wine selection.  Kids' Mac and cheese was homemade.  Sweet potato fries were very good.  For a signature dish, the pear salad was sort of disappointing, nothing special really.  Had shishito pepper, hummus, and buffalo cauliflower appetizers.  Solid in each case, but not exceptional.  Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant because we are new to the neighborhood and love trying new places.  A few observations, wine prices were terribly exorbitant.  At $10 for a glass of no-name Riesling, I just can't seeing myself doing that again.  My family ordered 2 kids meals with grilled cheese, I had the Perfectly grilled cheese (reminded me of a Monte Cristo sans the meat) and my husband had a plate of Alfredo, for what we ordered  $65 including tip just seemed over the top.  I think this place wants to have a high end feel, but the lack of a formal bar (bottles were huddled together on the serving line) and the male owner walking around in FLIP FLOPS, detracts from the high-end feel (think Postino's) that this restaurant wants to achieve.  A few suggestions for the owners (who I recognized from their picture in the paper): DRESS PROFESSIONALLY, and introduce yourselves as the owners so you can get constructive feedback from your patrons.  You'd think that the owners are embarrassed for anyone to know the place is theirs.  Next, move the alcohol behind the counter so you can at least PRETEND you have an actual bar, and please offer wine specials, most people (like me) like to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner and if that part of my dining experience is cost prohibitive, then I won't go to that restaurant for the food.  Next, turn the music down.  Dining is a social experience and if I can't hear people at my table, I'd rather just go somewhere else.  Finally, improve the customer service, your waitresses (and the female owner) dropped things on the table then ran off before we could ask for things like napkins, condiments, etc.  I thought this type of service was very unprofessional and makes me hesitant to return.  Overall, this place has excellent food.  I hope they can make some minor tweaks to their establishment so that they can hang around for the long haul and be a place people can go to in Ahwahtukee for a great meal!"}
{"text":"Perfect Grilled Cheese was amazing and worth a repeat  visit.  Chicken club lacked unique flavor and was average.  The BLT was great with the bread making the sandwiches.  Now for the sides: tomato soup was delicious and a perfect complement to the grilled cheese.  Shoe string fries were great, nothing not to like about them and the green pea salad in peanut sauce was delicious.  We will definitely return for another try!"}
{"text":"You had me at mac n cheese. In the name of all that is holy, the Mac and cheese. Traveled from LA in some part because we had heard that this place wasn't to be missed - and it wasn't. The goat cheese crostini appetizer was lovely, and both the chicken pesto and chicken club sandwiches were fantastic. But the Mac and cheese (grandmas and the green chili - we tried both) were unparalleled.   Service was excellent - friendly staff, seated quickly. Drinks refilled immediately. Food came up fast (amazing for hungry kids) and bill processed right away. We will definitely stop here any time we come to Scottsdale/Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! Super healthy food with lots of options.  The owner, Chris, is dedicated to quality ingredients and it shows.  Im vegetarian and highly recommend the \"harvest\" sandwich. The thai hummus is the bomb!!  Im told this place just opened 4 weeks ago.. Going great so far!.. Ill be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! It has plenty of parking and is fare enough away from Mill Ave to have a quite and more relaxing meal.  With plenty of delicious food options and an amazing happy hour, this place is a must try.  Their drink selection has plenty of local favorite and they have a nice list of custom cocktails. They have a great outdoor patio/courtyard, wonderful intimate indoor seating and with a nice bar to cozy up to."}
{"text":"I always take friends and family here when they come from out of town.  It's great food for a decent price.  If you're looking for finer food, you will have to pay more.  This is right in my price rage and seriously good food!"}
{"text":"This menu is ridiculous!  Rarely find a menu where you want to try everything.  We totally stumbled on this place for lunch and were impressed with service and food. My life partner, Melba, had a delicious salad and I had quinoa curry bowl which were all really good as well as the fresh guacamole. Great iced tea!  We can't find one negative thing about this place. Very very good job. Melba really loved the patio."}
{"text":"Wanted to try because of the proximity to home.  Staff was friendly but the food was so-so. I ordered a sandwich which, when I lifted the first half up to eat it, I found a bread tie underneath. Not the end of the world and they did comp my order. My unhappiness came from the skimpy portions and the high price. I actually ate when I came home."}
{"text":"Excellent food with excellent service!  We had lunch there today and thoroughly enjoyed it.  We both had the tortilla soup, which was really tasty...I had the sicilian sandwich and my wife had the strawberry fields salad...both were delicious.  We shared the humongous peach/pear cobbler for dessert and had to be restrained from licking the bowl clean...it was THAT good.    This restaurant has only been in its location since September but they've got a good thing going, so give them a try...you won't be disappointed.  They have a nice, varied menu of soups, salads, sandwiches,pastas and appetizers - something for everybody. Five stars from us!"}
{"text":"We don't eat here very often, but when we do, everyone is happy. I'm not big on cheese smells, yet the rest of my family loves to get the different cheeses, so we always get patio seating. I love their BLTA on focaccia. My young daughter likes the different cheese blend in the kids grilled cheese. My hubby is always trying dishes and has yet to be disappointed. Service is always good, and the ambience is cozy yet upscale."}
{"text":"The food was excellent! I had the jalapeno and bacon grilled cheese with the tomato basil soup. My husband enjoyed the green chilli mac n cheese. The atmosphere was family friendly. We  will certainly be back."}
{"text":"This place had a cute vibe and delicious food. The portion sizes were normal. I went on a Friday night and had no issues getting in. The service was great. No complaints here!"}
{"text":"Great food. Hubs had green chili Mac n cheese, to die for. I had an amazing strawberry fields salad. Super good! Met the owner, great guy, stopped and talked to us for a bit. Good wine and drink list and best part, no tvs! At all!! Not super intimate,  just nice to focus on good company and good food!"}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant! Atmosphere is great and a super courteous staff. This has turned into a weekly brunch stop for us, the pear bread French toast is literally the best French toast I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Incredible restaurant.  The food was awesome, as was the service!  Had the Brussels sprouts, a salad and a pesto grilled cheese.  The entire meal was flawless!  Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I loved my server and I loved the food even more! The only complaint I have is that the restaurants ac seemed a little too hot.. I noticed they had space fans around the restaurant but all it seemed to do was circulate the hot air. I am still willing to give this restaurant another shot but maybe in the fall or winter when it's not so hot."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in yesterday to get food to go.  The bread on the perfect grilled cheese is fantastic.  We also tried two salads and both were great."}
{"text":"This is a cute small restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating.  Their menu has a variety of options from salads, sandwiches, to pasta. Based on the reviews I was eager to try this place to see what it was all about. I ordered the Baja like salad. The presentation was nice, all the colors of the rainbow on my plate. As for flavor, it was just okay. The dressing didn't have much flavor and as the name might suggest, I didn't taste much lime. My friend ordered pesto Mac and cheese which I tasted and it was good although I didn't taste any cheese. It seemed more like a pesto pasta dish than a Mac and cheese pasta dish. Overall this place is just okay. I would probably return if someone wanted to meet up there but unlikely that I'll go back on my own"}
{"text":"The restaurant is a delight. Creative menu, nice ambience, and good prices.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Awesome place! First time here and I loved it! Got the cauliflower in spinach dip for appetizer, amazing! Rigatoni with sausage also knocked it out of the park for me...great size portion for very decent price. Service was fine but food and price  makes it a 5 star easily! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"So thankful for Perfect Pear! It is a go to for our family on busy nights. We can always count on the consistency of the food, and there is something for everyone, including our gluten-free little one."}
{"text":"Completely underwhelmed. Stopped in for lunch and it started off badly with a long wait because the hostess seemed totally confused - she didn't seem to know if she should be bussing tables or seating customers, all the while the line was growing out the door. When our server finally got to us I asked for iced tea to which she replied, \"We don't serve plain iced tea.\" No apology, no alternative. Okay, so then there's the food. I ordered the chicken club and it was flavorless. The chicken didn't seem to be seasoned at all and the bread may as well have come from the local grocery store. Last, was the overall cleanliness - the tables could use a good cleaning and the floors were quite filthy. Can't say I'd recommend this place."}
{"text":"The food was delicious!  They have a scrumptious twist on some classics. Ambiance was nice and casual. Went in the afternoon but looks like it would have a nice ambiance for a \"date night\". We had the Brie and Bacon as an appetizer. It was a small serving but delicious. It probably seemed smaller since it left us wanting more."}
{"text":"Such a gem! Service was impeccable, food was superb and the atmosphere was cozy and inviting. Everyone in the family found something delicious on the menu, we all ended up sharing bites. Cant wait to go back and try Brunch."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant. Went before performance at Gammage. Service was impeccable throughout the evening. Soup specials - tomato basil and mushroom Brie  were superb. Wraps were amazing - spicy southwest chicken was fixed to order. Servings were more than ample. Great price point. On tap red ale was smooth. Will do re runs to this fine place!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a local amazing restaurant to support- you need to check out the Perfect Pear Bistro.  The minute you step into the quaint establishment you are greeted with friendly people, soft music and an atmosphere that invites conversation and great fresh food.  Whether you're looking for a sandwich or salad or pasta, the food is fresh and good.  No TV's at this establishment- you actually get to converse with the person you're sharing a meal with.  The owner stopped by the table and genuinely wanting to know about our experience.  Even if you don't like in ahwatukee- it's worth the drive.  Let them know Debbie sent you."}
{"text":"Yummy food for eating healthy. The peach cobbler is absolutely delicious and I'm sure you'll clean the plate."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed drinks here last night. The pear martini is wonderful, not too sweet, very fresh tasting.  The appetizers were good too although they wouldn't let you order happy hour tapas (even at a higher price) when it wasn't happy hour so that cut the appetizer list down. Overall service was good too.  The only critique I have is that the outside patio area is really blah, awful metal chairs and bright lights, the inside is quite comfortable though. I'll definitely go back for the Pear martinis and flatbread."}
{"text":"Ate here twice for Sunday brunch. The food is excellent. The portion size is right for the price and the presentation is colorful and fresh! The atmosphere is simple and clean and very pleasant. The menu consist of a variety of salads, sandwiches, pastas and grilled cheeses! It truly represents it's name because pears are in a lot of the dishes and offers what a classical bistro would sell. To top everything all off they brew there own speciality iced teas....oh ya and the service is excellent as well!"}
{"text":"LOVE every single thing I've had on the menu here. The food is so fresh and I love the bistro ambiance that they have. We have always had great customer service and it's one of our favorite spots in town!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, quick and friendly service; nice, clean atmosphere. Enjoyed the variety in menu options and food was delicious. Healthy, hearty and good!"}
{"text":"I was referred by a co-worker, we work just around the corner and always looking for new lunch spots. We went to their new location on Ray and Priest.  I ordered the bacon & jalapeno grilled cheese to-go and it was so delicious. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking to try something new and flavorful."}
{"text":"Great food, great happy hour, good wine selection and fabulous pear martinis!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food and value.  A couple of things that need to happen:  they serve pasta dishes but don't provide bread.  They have no dessert options at this time.  I will be back when these are corrected."}
{"text":"Bacon jalapeño grilled cheese is the best thing ever. I kept meaning to try this place but never actually did until today when I found myself stuck home with a sick child. I ordered via Door Dash and it was amazing. I can only imagine how good it will be when I finally make it there in person!"}
{"text":"We came here for an early lunch.  Service was excellent and we loved most of the dishes.  Nice to have a cute local spot!"}
{"text":"Wonderful healthy place for lunch. Great for meetings or just to enjoy a break from the office."}
{"text":"I love visiting the Perfect Pear everytime I visit the Chandler, AZ area. Sometimes, two or three times. Lol. I love the grilled cheese with jalepeno and bacon, the Brussels sprout salad and the Tuscan Rigatoni. They have a combo deal for 1/2 soup and salad, or 1/2 pasta and salad. Really delish and affordable. Service is a little slow at times."}
{"text":"First time eating here, ordered a takeout meal and had \"ciabatta\" bread on the side. Worst ciabatta bread I've ever had. It was like paper, tissue paper. Jimmy John's uses nicer bread for their sandwiches. As for the pastas, they were okay, my boyfriend added chicken to his Mediterranean Mac n' Cheese and had to spit it out because it was too chewy. I had the butternut squash pasta and it was alright, wouldn't get it again. Portion size was huge, good for the price."}
{"text":"Decided to give this a try today.  Not disappointed at all.  The Signature and Perfectly Peared Bruschetta was very fresh and a great blending of flavors.  The Perfectly Grilled Cheese Sandwich was delicious with the spiced pear bread.  The staff was very friendly and attentive as was Chris, the owner.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. There is so much variety at Perfect Pear. So far I have tried the \"Perfect Grilled Cheese\" and the \"Cabo Spicy Cobb\" wrap and both were delicious. The service here is excellent and is a perfect place to grab a bite to eat in the East Valley. Looking forward to exploring more of the menu in the future."}
{"text":"I ordered a quad city philly from perfect pair. It was a delight to have. The cheese dip appetizer was also something I would order again. Ambience was good; perfect pair could serve as a quick bite to get with your friends or a fancyish place to take your date. I would come back here for lunch and dinnerZ"}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious! We had butternut squash tacos and butternut squash rigatoni, both fantastic! Great sangria, and the pear cobbler was heavenly."}
{"text":"This place is small so I feel bad righting this review but the service was not good. The food was also mediocre. I went because the menu looked really good but I was just disappointed by how it actually tasted. Good concepts, just not well executed."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch for a work meeting with 5 others. It was noon and was quite busy, but we were still seated quickly. We ordered three different appetizers: the guacamole, green chili cheese dip, and spinach dip. The guac was really good. The dips all came with a large amount of tortilla chips, cucumber slices, and crostini bread.  For my entree I ordered the peanut coconut curry quinoa bowl. It was a very large serving and was heaped full of fresh veggies. There was cooked cauliflower and broccoli on top and my only problem was that the pieces were quite large and difficult to cut in a bowl filled with other items. But I really enjoyed the dish. The curry sauce was a little spicy, but not too much for my taste. I thought about requesting the recipe since I liked it so much.  I had enough food leftover to save for another meal.   By the time we left, there were quite a few people now waiting for tables. It seems to be a popular lunch spot for a lot of professionals, probably due to its closeness to several business parks. I will go back again in the future."}
{"text":"Fantastic.   Flavored iced teas are great.  4 cheese sandwiches  and one beef 'Sicilian\".  All excellent.   We all took home half a sandwich --so they are big servings.  The sweet potato frys are to die for.   Service was excellent and they sent each of us home with an Iced tea.  Definately a repeat."}
{"text":"Man I really want to like this place as soon as you walk in the door you're greeted very nicely decorated as a bistro should be nothing fancy just nicely done server was right to the table getting drinks and good at answering questions on the menu service was great as well started off with their quesadilla which was caramelized onions and some other stuff can of beans and a side of I think was chipotle ranch all is really tasty so a super excited for the grilled cheese a cinnamon pear bread and and Brie cheese and I do love cinnamon bread and Brie cheese but took one bite it was so disgusting I don't have know how to explain it how to train my wife for her rigatoni that was horrible too it was so acidic cuz I can meet my stomach sour going to get the taste out of my mouth for hours horrible the waitress try to fix it but by that time I was just grossed out but excellent customer service and really good quesadilla only reason why I'm giving him 3 stars would probably be too and a service was bad over in definitely one but rarely he not eat my food even if I don't like it never go back for sure"}
{"text":"If I had to eat only one thing for the rest of my life, it would be their peach and pear cobbler. It is served warm with vanilla ice cream. It is seriously delicious!"}
{"text":"My favorite go to place. Found them when I first moved here and was over hungry and starving Order a bunch of menu items way more than I could eat but all were great My favorites are the Perfect Pear Grilled Cheese and Perfect Pear Salad My favorite is the Priest location in Tempe Always great service and get the changes I need made to my order"}
{"text":"My wife and I visited the Chandler location for dinner.  We found the food delicious and the restaurant very helpful in accommodating our dietary requirements.  Staff was professional and friendly.  There was so much to sample on their menu that was tempting.  Very tasty grilled cheese sandwiches and soups.  The Pear martini was addicting.  We would go back for more at the first opportunity to sample other dishes.  Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Nice place for lunch. The green chile bisque was delicious and their salads are consistently good."}
{"text":"Perfect Pear is a very welcome addition to Ahwatukee!  They have lots of vegetarian-friendly and fresh, healthy options; they also have plenty of tasty carnivore options.  I went for lunch on a Sunday, and I'll be going back for happy hour as well as more lunches.    The patio was a perfect place to sit on a sunny afternoon, with plenty of shade available.  Service was excellent - attentive without being annoying.    I had the olives & pesto goat cheese appetizer.  I've never seen an app quite like this, and really enjoyed it.  The crostini were crisp but not too crisp, the pesto and goat cheese were fresh, and it has a very generous helping of assorted olives.  I also ordered the Wild Chop Salad on the spinach and kale mix.  It also included dried cranberries, feta cheese, cucumbers, roasted red peppers, pears & sunflower seeds.  The roasted red pepper slices were much bigger than any other component in the salad and didn't really fit in with the rest of the dish.  I put them aside and ate them separately - the rest of it was tasty."}
{"text":"Needed a quick stop to fuel up and this really hit the spot.   The environment was very pleasant with great outdoor seating!   Menu was very expansive and allowed you to mix and match some of the options to get the perfect \"pear\".   The ingredients were very fresh and complimented the dishes well.   Our party stayed mainly on the salads and the pastas and all enjoyed their selection."}
{"text":"Had a very nice lunch here! The service was great!  The Beer selection was really good and server was very knowledgeable about the beers so we liked that as we are craft beer people!  The menu had a lot of great choices and we really enjoyed our food.  My son's Mac and Cheese was delicious!  My other son thoroughly enjoyed his chicken club with sweet potato fries.  My husband and I each had the pear cob. His in a salad and mine in a wrap with a side of broccoli salad.  All were yummy. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I don't think I've given a 5 star review in a mighty long time but my goodness I LOVE this place!! I've been twice. It was love at first bite but I didn't want to be deceived so I decided to give it another try before writing my 5 star review.   The first time I dined here I had the Quad City Melt and the soup of the moment. Delicious! The Quad City Melt was soooooo good. I stopped in today for lunch and ordered the Fall Leaves salad with red onions and dried cranberries. Holy crap!! Try it!!   Happy hour is served daily from 11am - 6pm. Do not skip the red sangrias and the peach Margaritas, by far some of the best. $6.50 a pop, regularly priced at 7.50 and 8.50.  They feature a lunch combo (1/2 salad and 1/2 pasta, 1/2 salad and soup but you can't order a half sandwich and half salad). That's the only bummer for me, besides that. It's by far one of my favorite spots for lunch!! Oh ... if you want to add chicken to your salad know that it's baked, no or grilled. I'm not big on meat in my salad but if I do I prefer it's grilled"}
{"text":"I really like this place. A great happy hour! The food is intelligent and tasty! I will be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Tried again, no different. Plus too my fav wine off happy hour. Didn't like what I ordered, no biggie I ordered it but server said nothing. Was hard to order additional drinks or food I liked, service needs work"}
{"text":"This plave is perfection.  The good,  the drinks,  the staff.  Wonderful.  We always have the nicest waitresses who joke and chat with us and the peach mimosa is incredible! Love this place"}
{"text":"Our first experience with the perfect pair bistro was Valentines day dinner. We had never been there before it was raining and we were looking for a great restaurant. Percent we go every other week or so and it's always a fabulous meal! We're always so surprised and delighted with every meal. If you're looking for a healthy fresh delicious food the perfect pear bistro is one of our favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"this isn't about the food. my family didn't make it that far. if you have children, skip this place. it's not family friendly; no high chairs, they had to dig kid menus out of the dungeons. beyond kiddo accomodations, which is fine we can live without that, the manager was audibly and visibly put out by our toddlers crayon on the ground.picking it up with a loud sigh and throwing it on the host table (instead of returning it to my child right next to him).  having been seated for a while with out service plus a rude manager expressing his displeasure with our children, our family left. they might have the best food in the world but what they won't have is my money. there is nothing acceptable about treating customers so rudely."}
{"text":"COME TO THE WEST SIDE! My best friend and I wanted a salad after trudging through IKEA. I had the chopped salad with the pesto vinaigrette, my friend had the perfect pear salad. Both were fresh and delicious and the pesto vinaigrette was wonderful. We really need you in the Arrowhead area!"}
{"text":"Finally a gluten friendly restaurant.  Pleasant staff and nice atmosphere.  Check out the harvest sandwich or the half and half deals."}
{"text":"Nice place for a quite, relaxing lunch. Small but effective beer offering. Top shelf noshes."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a quick Saturday afternoon lunch as we were in the neighborhood.   I was impressed with the great service.  We had two different salads (the Baja lime and the autumn), both with chicken added.  They were delicious!   Looking forward to a return visit."}
{"text":"We love Perfect Pear Bistro!   Their salads are so fresh and delicious.   The pasta is also a huge hit.   It's a favorite for carry out as it's usually ready in 10 minutes or less.   Favorite salads?   Baja Lime and Fall Leaves."}
{"text":"Amazing staff and food. Black & Blue  Brussel sprouts are yummy! Tried the pasta dish Rosemary Cream and will definitely order that again!"}
{"text":"This bistro was delicious and the service was excellent.  My friend and I split the Fall Leaves salad and the Perfectly Grilled cheese.  The grilled cheese was served on spiced pear bread and complimented the sandwich perfectly.  There are many other items on the menu that looked really good as well.  I doubt you could go wrong with any of the choices.  Will definitely return to this restaurant in the future."}
{"text":"This was a random find for me when I was looking to expand my horizons past my typical restaurants.  It was a bit of a drive for me and it was located in a bit of an odd area, but it was very cute when I walked in!    They had a huge selection of items on the menu and is definitely a good place to go if your group has a wide selection of food opinions.  I got the flatbread and it was very tasty.  It was a bit small so if you have a large appetite, I would recommend order something else as well!  Overall, Perfect Pear Bistro was pretty tasty and cute, as well as reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, timely service, good food. My husband and I split the chicken pesto sandwich, it was a pretty decent size and delicious! I would definitely give this place and other menu items another try."}
{"text":"I had the most Amazing strawberry salad here. Everything was fresh and flavorful. The salad was a bit on the pricey side but it was worth every penny. It was huge and enough for either two people or two sittings. You wouldn't be disappointed with eating the food here. I did not dine in, I did a pickup order. So, I can not necessarily speak to the type of service they have."}
{"text":"Got take out from here when I was staying at a hotel nearby. Omgggg!  I got the 1/2 pasta 1/2 salad with the fall salad and the rigatoni butternut squash pasta. The portions were huge!!!  Everything was fresh and amazing!  All that for only $14. The ambiance looked super charming and I can't wait to go back and dine in. Highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Opted here for the berry and quinoa salad.  The salad was good and the quinoa was chilled which provided for a balanced tasted.  Ingredients tasted fresh and delightful."}
{"text":"Our family went on Valentines Day for lunch. The place is nice and cozy feeling, although the temperature inside was a bit cold for us.  We ordered the hummus appetizer which was good, came with a lot of vegetables, could have had more crostini instead of so many vegetables.  We had an order of the perfect pear flatbread which was very good, the Mediterranean mac and cheese was tasty, the mushroom melt which was good, but needed more cheese and mushrooms, and the kids mac and cheese.   They were out of the butternut squash which was what we were going to order. We noticed the tapas menu which looked very good, served 2-6pm, so we will have to come back during that time."}
{"text":"First of all, how quaint is this patio?! Aside from the sounds of the cars driving 10 feet from your ears, I feel like I'm transported out of Arizona and into some adorable country side restaurant. Huge plus that it's pup-friendly too. This is my second time here and both times my husband and I ordered the Pear Mule - not too sweet, not too strong...it's juust right! Last time I got the Harvest Sandwich which was major noms, but this time I hit the jackpot with the Peanut Coconut Curry Quinoa Bowl. I think this would be great as a wrap as well. This will pair well with the colder temps in the upcoming months. I've got my eye on the Baja Lime and the Berry Avocado bowl for my next visit. Overall, if you want a cute place to eat clean I would highly recommend this place. Both times our bill was around $35 for 2 meals, and 2 drinks. (Happy hour the pear mule is $6.5 compared to $8 for the regular pricing)"}
{"text":"I love this place! Their butternut squash fall salad is amazing! Also love the ambience. Service is good. A bit pricey, but worth it."}
{"text":"The Perfect Pear is a chic/casual restaurant with a modern vibe. It's a smaller space, but filled with cute decorations. I ordered the pomegranate mojito and the G'Mas mac & cheese with Italian sausage. Both were delicious! I would recommend this to others who are looking for an easy, yummy restaurant. I will still be back!"}
{"text":"Everything was excellent. I had the green chili Mac with chicken and the spinach dip. Great presentation, excellent flavor, and friendly service. A trifecta that will get me to come back."}
{"text":"I wouldn't say this place is GOOD for kids (as the page description says), as its your typical quiet bistro, not a Peter Piper, but there were a lot of families in there with young children when we went. I attribute this to being within the Ahwatukee area which is bustling with young families.  Service definitely did not have me writing home, but the food was pretty good. I likely won't come back, because it just wasn't my vibe, but that does not affect my rating.   I came here with the hubby for restaurant week, so our food included appetizers and meals. The quesadilla was good- but the dipping sauce was absolutely fantastic. I don't know what it was, just that it was awesome!   As others mentioned, the jalapeño mac and cheese was a classic, with a kick. Portions weren't huge, but we had appetizers so it was fine. I ordered an cranberry/apple salad and it was good as well.   Overall, cute spot; I won't drive the 15-20 minutes it takes for me to get there, but I am glad I tried out a new place for restaurant week!"}
{"text":"The food is so good and so fresh here. I love this place and the atmosphere is always chill. They have a great beer and wine selection too. The staff is friendly and patient. Went with my aunt and she could not decide on anything and our server was very patient and knowledgeable on the menu."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try out Perfect Pear Bistro for a while, so I was excited when my friend agreed to give this place a try with me after it opened up in Tempe! It wasn't very busy when we went on a weeknight after work. They had some happy hour drink specials so we each ended up getting a Pear Cider to start off with. There were a few different food options on special as well, but we opted to order off the menu for dinner.  I ordered the Chicken Pesto sandwich with french fries and my friend ordered the 1/2 salad (Pear Cobb) and 1/2 pasta (Tuscan Rigatoni). The salad came out & looked really good. It was pretty large too for a half salad (completely missed the chance of snagging a photo)! My friend said the salad was good & the pasta was just okay. As far as my order goes, I thought the sandwich was okay. The ciabatta bread wasn't toasted which I wish it would've been and the chicken was a bit dry. I actually picked it all off so that was a miss for me, I wouldn't order it again.  There were quite a few interesting options on the menu though that I'd be willing to give this place another chance. For now though, three stars!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! You just can't beat a good gluten-free-friendly place with SO many options. Great patio. Great happy hour. The Cuban was so so good!! Definitely eat here!! :)"}
{"text":"I have driven by this place numerous times and decided to stop by.  It was pretty good.  I ordered the Cuban with out cheese.  (did not have lactose pills.) The French fries were good too.  I will come back and try something else on the menu.  The service was good too."}
{"text":"Intro: We were just passing through on our way to a New Year's Eve EDM event and needed food and a bathroom break.  Pros: -the bathrooms are amazing and super clean and smell great. -the ambience is also amazing. Lovely hip decor. -menu is incredibly diverse and for those with a desire to taste unusual things  Cons: -They completely forgot our order of fries with the sandwich. Since we were just passing by, it wasn't feasible for us to drive back for it. Be sure to always check your order before you leave. -the mushroom soup was too salty for me. Tasted like a condensed version or something. Otherwise it was pretty good but I had to drink a ton of water with it. -the chicken sandwich was very ordinary and didn't seem to live up to the enticing description on the menu according to my boyfriend. He ended up throwing it out.   Overall: It's a bit out of the way so I probably won't come back. Considering all the wonderful reviews I'm thinking maybe I could've ordered better tasting things. Regardless it fell short of our expectations."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants!!! We love this place. Great service and food. Also a nice place to relax. So many great vegetarian options that taste amazing. The hummus nachos are the best!!! I hope they open up more locations soon!!!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. The food the ambience the service all a five-star. Next time we're in Arizona we will be coming back here. If you're looking for a trendy place with great food and a great vibe this is the place."}
{"text":"Beautiful spot with awesome food! The place is decorated wonderfully and everything on the menu looks wonderful. I had the half salad half pasta combo. I wanted the asparagus soup but they were out. The servers were very nice but slow and forgetful. They left the door open on a cold, rainy night so we were freezing but we enjoyed our food so much!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food at this neighborhood spot and (used to) come for happy hour often with my ladies. The patio always has a nice vibe, with guests and their doggos hanging out with a glass of wine despite it being a million degrees outside.   On my last visit, my card was charged an additional 9$ (assuming the server tipped herself). I didn't tip on the card because I left cash. I did email them and the manager did respond promptly asking me to give him a call. But eh, it's 9 bucks and by the time I saw his email, I had been out of town for a week. Didn't seem worth it to call. I just doubt that I'll ever go back. It left a bad taste in my mouth and I hope the server realizes losing her job isn't worth such a small amount of money. Any respectable establishment has their servers go through their receipts at the end of the night in order to avoid any potential mistakes like this.   There's too many cool places around the valley that also have delicious food to bother coming here again and receive lackluster (and either dishonest or careless) service. Looking back on all my experiences here, the service is the one thing that stands out in a negative way. This was my first time sitting at a table, but none of the bartenders are ever friendly or even behind the bar to be helpful. Where do all the servers disappear off to?? The atmosphere is nice and the managers on duty always seem to be engaged with what's going on in the dining room and I really appreciate that as I come from a restaurant background myself.   The food IS tasty though, and I was looking forward to trying everything on the menu at some point... All of the appetizers are wonderful. On our last visit, my friends and I all got different pasta dishes. If you do go, I'd recommend the Mediterranean Mac & Cheese - I ate every stinkin' bite. I remember the Creamy Mushroom Marsala being extremely flavorful and delicious as well, and I don't particularly even enjoy mushrooms!"}
{"text":"A small group of co-workers went out to celebrate Lindsay O's 29th birthday (yay!) over lunch and we decided on Perfect Pear Bistro. This place is exceptional!  As soon as we walked in and I saw how full the restaurant was, I knew it must be good!  Fresh, cute, and inviting surroundings. Amazing food. I went with Pacos Pear Tacos - the chicken was so flavorful and tender and the bacon pieces were the best compliment. The pear pico they topped them off with was perfectly spicy and delicious- the pear adding nice texture and brightness. They also used pear in the black beans which was so unique and so good!  The rest of the party went with versions of the grilled cheese and salads. Based on the presentation, I'm sure the flavor did not disappoint!  I'm so excited to have found this gem!"}
{"text":"Great food! The menu has its own unique twist and so very good! My kids and I enjoy this place! Love everything about it. Only downfall is the patio is very small."}
{"text":"This bistro will actually satisfy your hunger unlike other modest lunch spots it offers more than the lighter fare of soup/salad/sandwich combos. The pasta dishes steal the show..go for Athena's Garden and add a protein (you won't be disappointed with their spinach dip either ;)"}
{"text":"Great service, comfortable ambiance, a wonderful place to meet up with friends for a long \"catching up\" lunch.  The Curry Chicken soup is \"to die for!\""}
{"text":"I really love this place - Especially for the 1/2 & 1/2 options when I'm feeling particularly indecisive. The salads are wonderful (though a better proportion in topping:lettuce ratio in the half size.)  I really like the Perfect Pear Classic salad, the Wild Chop salad, and my new great love the Pear Blossom salad, pears, almonds, yellow raisins, quinoa, feta, and mint with a poppyseed dressing.  I've tried the Mediterranean Mac & Cheese (roasted red peppers, caramelized onions, arugala, feta and cheesy pesto) as well as as the Creamy Mushroom Marsala pasta (caramelized onions, mushrooms and roasted garlic), but my favorite is the Athena's Garden pasta (zucchini, arugula, caramelized onions, sauteed mushrooms, and garlic basil sauce) as the garlic flavor is quite strong and delicious. I really like that gluten free pasta is not extra and you can add a protein, salmon, chicken, sausage, etc., on to most things.   Service here has always been great and very attentive."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch place! Buffalo chicken tacos were so filling and tastey! The chicken Marsala pasta dish was also well received by my coworker. My other coworker also had the butternut squash tacos and loved them! There was no food left on any of our plates. Would definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First time here and I'm impressed. The food is fresh and tastes great. The atmosphere is clean and modern. This is a great lunch spot."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely fantastic. The food is delicious, the patio is lovely, and the music was subtle but really set the tone."}
{"text":"The perfect pair is a great blend of chic and delicious. Green chili Mac was bomb as was my wife's perfect grilled cheese. We both got the pear mule and it was great! Our server Taylor was helpful and nice. The interior reminded us of our usual places in Portland. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"We have driven by this place for a long time and never tried it. Based off other reviews we were expecting decent food and slow service. That's not what we got. Food was very, very good. Pasta was cooked just right and servings were huge. Service was also excellent. It was Friday night and the place was pretty crowded. Sat down at 7, had appetizers, salad and dinner and we were paying our bill by 735.....now that was fast. We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Brunch at perfect pear was awesome!!  I loved the pancake that tasted like cinnamon  YOU WILL LOVE IT!!"}
{"text":"I came here with my daughter for a leisurely Saturday lunch, and I must admit,  we are very impressed. The food is very fresh, portions are large, and the wait staff extremely attentive!  I think I may have found my new lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Cute place.  Good happy hour.  Nothing really special but I would go back again if in the area."}
{"text":"Really awesome restaurant! My boyfriend and I tried this place out for the first time yesterday. The menu was filled with unique, (relatively) healthy, and yummy-sounding entrees. For an appetizer we got the olive and goat cheese dip wit crostini (which we definitely recommend!!) I had the \"Perfectly-Grilled Cheese\" with pesto and he had a house salad wrap. Both dishes were very good! The only negative thing I have to say about this place is that when we visited, it was very quiet and the ambiance was slightly awkward because of that. The restaurant/patio deck itself was gorgeous but the fact that the background music kept getting turned off/down was a little off-putting. Other than that it's a great restaurant and we will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Thanks Yelp for helping me find this awesome restaurant! The menu has lots of things to satisfy everyone's palate.    My friend and I tried a few items and they were all extremely tasty - butternut squash soup, one of the grilled cheeses, one of the salads.  The use of pear bread on the grilled cheese made for a unique and satisfying sandwich,"}
{"text":"This place is THE BOMB! I have eaten at their other location in Ahwautukee and loved every bite in each location!  We ordered the buffalo cauliflower and it was just okay; I would never order it again.  The shishito peppers were yummy with a bit of a kick.   I had the 1/2 salad 1/2 pasta combo so I tried the spicy Cobb salad with mushroom Marsala and OMG my tasted buds were in heaven!  My friend had the 1/2 & 1/2 combo too with a regular Cobb salad and the butternut rigatoni - it too was very tasty.    It was PACKED at lunch time so bring your patience if you come during lunch hour as there was a line out the door.  Despite it being busy, we had great service.    I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing! Had the new harvest sandwhich it was great. The family had bruschetta and strawberry fields salad and they loved it too. Service was off though. Only reason for the three stars. Not very tentative. Ran out of my drink for about 20 mins and then he finally asked if we wanted more after we ate. Lost about four dollars because I would have loved another orange blossom! Overall great food but short staff both physically and attitude. The girl staff was great though! Hopefully if I come back the service will be more cognitive. Also no military discount?!?! Shoot give at least 5% for those who served. Definitely need to fix that lost a star there."}
{"text":"This place was excellent and the experience started with our very awesome server Petar.  He was attentive but not overbearing.  I had the Perfectly Grilled Cheese with sweet potato fries.  We had 8 in our party and everyone got something different. Everyone enjoyed their food.   We were there early on a Saturday (4 pm) and it was pretty empty.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Had the Cabo Spicy Cobb today- great flavor and veggies are farm fresh!  Service was great as well- I asked for no onion/cilantro- no problem.  Great place!"}
{"text":"We ate there several times and THE food was very good. Three weeks ago we went back and ordered the Bruschetta specifically Bat a Bing..... They removed the garlic and it was soggy.....we departed very disappointed. How or why would anyone remove garlic form a Bruschetta......... .I'm done"}
{"text":"I am amazed by this place! Everything on the menu looked fantastic! The portions are big and the food is mouth watering! The service is exceptional! I totally recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Such a great restaurants for a vegetarian their are tons of options I had the vegetarian focatia sandwich with corn soup and it was amazing. The French fries also look great. I can't wait to go back again"}
{"text":"I just love the food here, it's a greatMenu. Everything tasted fresh I love the grill cheese sandwiches"}
{"text":"Met some coworkers for dinner and I specifically asked if the cheese sauce was real or fake cheese.  They said real and wrong.  I ordered a Cuban sandwich and bowl of tomato basil soup.  The Cuban came on marble rye bread and was not done on a panini press.  Tomato basil soup should be more than tomato soup with a little bit of basil sprinkled in the middle ffs."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place! A friend suggested it for dinner on a Wednesday and we arrived around 7:30 to a mostly empty restaurant, but it was full when we left! I had the butternut squash tacos with caramelized onions, quinoa, feta and a cream sauce because that just sounded so interesting they had to be amazing or terrible. They were amazing.  Absolutely order these! My friend got the Mediterranean salad and I had a few bites. It was fresh and interesting.  I can't wait to come back and sit on their cute patio!"}
{"text":"From the moment we entered the staff was very nice opening the door for me & my friend. Our server was friendly, and answered all of our questions. I ordered the green tea which was tasty & refreshing. For lunch I ordered the grilled cheese sandwich and it was good on the pear bread."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot.  Close and convenient.  Fresh and friendly.  Attractive and affordable."}
{"text":"Impressed!! Very friendly and exceptional customer service. Environment was quiet and relaxing. Food and wine was delicious as well."}
{"text":"Kids and I dropped by after we found it on yelp. We had a good experience. I found plenty of healthy choices. My hard to please children each found somthing they liked and ate on the kids menu. The wait staff was nice and helpful. Food was served promptly drinks were kept full. The clever name brought us in cu and we left happy and  satified. We will be back."}
{"text":"Came with a friend and it was packed! Great food and cocktails. The pear mule takes the cake and the salads were filling! Definitely going back again!"}
{"text":"1st time coming to this place and loved it. As soon as you walk in you feel welcome and everyone is very nice. We had the guacamole app which was very good and you can taste how fresh it was, had a little to much red onion but still very yummy. My boyfriend had the chicken club sandwich and I had the BLT which were both amazing. I also had a pear martini and he had a cucumber mule. I wasn't a fan of the cucumber mule but he liked it and said it was fresh and would be awesome when it gets hot out here in AZ. Overall this place is awesome and we will be coming back to try some of their other items"}
{"text":"Waitress took forever, didn't take any of our plates after we ate all of our appetizers, she just moved them and squeezed our entrees on the table. I didn't catch her name but she was really rude and didn't get my mother's order correctly. We were the only people in the place. We got some weird hot pepper starter and did not like it at all. Entrees were ok, I really wanted to like this place but I will not be coming back. Overall food was ok but the service was terrible."}
{"text":"Sorry very inconsistent salmon was once under cooked and then over cooked Take out orders lost and wait staff had poor attitude.  On good days food is good They need to be more consistent and change attitude when they make mistakes"}
{"text":"Love the pear! Hard to choose a favorite dish. Great menu. Have visited both Ahawatukee and Tempe locations several times."}
{"text":"Our first time trying this eatery. We are from a different city with not much variety and we were looking forward to trying to spot. It's conveniently located near the freeway in a business park. We went on a Sunday and there was a ton of parking. The menu is pretty extensive and creative with pear worked in creatively in most dishes. The six of us each got something different and everything was delicious from sandwiches to pasta to salads. I had a mushroom pasta that was so creamy and earthy. The wait staff was great and did a good job with refills and removing empty dishes. We ordered two deserts to share, lemon cake with fresh strawberries  and peach cobbler. They were fresh and hit the spot and the server brought enough spoons for each person. The decor had modern Farm house feel with chalkboard, salvaged pieces and white tiles."}
{"text":"Perfect Pear has been on my list of places to try for a long time, because it always comes up on my Yelp suggestions and has awesome ratings.   We got here just as they opened, so we were seated and brought our drinks immediately. The service was really great, with our server very attentive and friendly. Added bonus, super comfy booths.  The food, however, was just fine. My chicken coconut curry soup, was good; I just feel like I didn't get very much for the price point. The fella got the pear cobb with salmon added. He said that the salad itself was pretty good, and liked the vinaigrette, but the salmon was very lackluster. It seemed like an oven-roasted salmon that was a little too cooked and not seasoned with anything. Not terrible, but not worth an extra $5 to add to a salad. Just seemed a smidge pricey for decent but not amazing food. ,Afterwards I asked a friend who lives nearby, and she said she feels the same way about it.   Also, as a side note, they do not have a separate breakfast menu despite opening at 10:30. Not a huge deal, just a little weird.  Overall, the experience was totally fine, just not mindblowing, like we expected based on the super high ratings. We might be back for happy hour or something, but it probably won't become a regular spot."}
{"text":"The food at PP Bistro is great. Always fresh, and succulent. Who would have thought a salad place could be so versatile. The only weakness here is the service. Tho the staff tries to be nice, and do what they can; during the lunch hour they seem to get a bit overwhelmed. It's as if they are not prepared for a busy lunch rush, and as a result are forced to either dissuade people from having lunch there, or worse, not serve to the level of expectation. I mention this because my colleagues and I went there of course, and undoubtedly so, they told us \"yea you might not want to stay here if your on break\" in which I could appreciate the concern but it came off as if they didn't want the business. I'd rather make that decision or come to that conclusion myself, not be told as if I'm being told to leave.. Once again, the food and prices make up for the laps in service, but it's unfortunate that they are lacking in that particular area..."}
{"text":"Just moved into this area from not too far away and was looking for a great local place and I found it. Great food, excellent selection of wine and beer. Love to support local business."}
{"text":"Been there twice and so far the food I've had there is awesome. Not only is the food good but they have good beer choice. Tacos and the quesadilla with chicken are defiantly worth getting again."}
{"text":"Great! This place really has it all! Located near ASU, but with PARKING and a great patio! The food is great! Salad greens are always fresh, the grilled cheese is amazing and the Peanut Curry Quinoa bowl is a must try. The service was top notch especially for a large group during lunch. They have a bar and best thing this is a locally owned restaurant. Check them out!"}
{"text":"It was my first time here, it was a quiet Monday evening inside the restaurant.  The atmosphere is nice, and the menu is a mix of Quesadillas, Salads, Sandwiches and Soup.  They had a pretty good drink list, I ordered a Riesling that was $6 and was pretty good.  They had 3 soup options, we ordered 2 of them, a vegetable beef and the Bean and Ham, both were very tasty and a bowl was $5.  For dinner they have Soup and Salad options, which is nice, I ordered the BLTA and it looked great when it came out however the foccacia bread it was on was pretty bad, I ended up with a BLTA salad.  My dining partner had a Tinos salad with beets, hazelnuts, goat cheese and chicken which cost an extra $3.  We will likely go back but I wont order the sandwich again, they have pretty interesting salads, so I will go with that and the soup."}
{"text":"This was a cute spot. The best this was the pear mule! Sooo good  so refreshing.. really like the appetizers too."}
{"text":"We are new to the neighborhood and are so excited that we found it. The service is exceptional, food is amazing (the BLT is delicious) and the vibe is good too! Go check it out, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I pass this place frequently and always say \"I need to try that place sometime\"   Tonight was the night. I love the vegetarian and gluten free options offered on the menu. I had the roasted butternut tacos and they were delish!  I will definitely be back to try some other items. I was happy to see that they have a patio.  My favorite way to dine especially with such amazing weather right now. I look forward to returning"}
{"text":"This has become one of our favorite places for lunch. The sandwich selection is excellent, the pastas are delicious, and the salads are fresh and creative. Our service has always been excellent, friendly staff, and the manager of the restaurant, Chris, seems to be around a lot to make sure the place runs well. A great selection of music is always on.  Some particular favorite entree sandwiches are The Sicilian and The Chicken Marsala. A favorite pasta dish with great flavor is the Athena. The salads are fresh and creative, and the perfect pair is a good combination of soup, salad and/or pasta.   They have had a weekend where they feature live music. I hope they do more."}
{"text":"Great location in the foothills, good food and service. Management is very attentive and professional. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Came here today for a work lunch and it was awesome! We were able to reserve a table and order our food ahead of time because we have a short time for lunch. Everything was awesome and service was perfect."}
{"text":"I had a pesto grilled cheese, with sweet potato fries.  The presentation was picture perfect, and the flavor was sublime.  It was marvelous!"}
{"text":"First time here the other night on Friday. No wait for a table great beer selections, they have amazing grilled cheese! Next time I go I'm trying a different one. Sweet potato fries are on point! Our waitress was awesome the atmosphere is casual which was nice and wasn't very loud. It's not super close to my place but it's worth a small trip to go again!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite restaurant in Ahwatukee!  Been coming here for years and the food is always amazing!  SO good, and always adding new items. Love having healthy, delicious food options so close by!! Perfect for families, friends, couples and takeout!! Staff is always super friendly and attentive!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I try something different every time and haven't had anything I don't like yet."}
{"text":"Have heard lot about this place. Just wanted to try when i was searching for a place for dinner. I'm always open for Italian food, Me and my buddy ordered creamy mushroom marsala pasta with chicken and creamy butternut rigatoni with shrimp and salmon. They taste ready good, especially creamy mushroom marsala which I couldn't take a picture of it but really taste flavorful I highly recommend to try that."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! GREAT food, vast selection and so many gluten free options!!  the flavors are unique and DELICIOUS!!  I highly recommend Perfect Pear.  P.S. Try the Pear Mule!!!"}
{"text":"Very nice, clean, and friendly establishment. I came in with a friend for lunch on a Tuesday.  Service- 4 stars We sat at a high-top in the bar and was greeted by a server immediately. She was very friendly and answered all of our questions, and gave us recommendations.  Food- 2 1/2 stars We got three entrees and shared everything- pasta was good, fries were great, and the chicken sandwich was exactly what you would expect. Nothing was amazing.  Ambiance- 2 1/2 stars-nothing really \"Peary\" about the joint. very clean, but had that cliche' hipster feel everyone goes for these days."}
{"text":"Yay!! I'm a fan! I love Perfect Pair Bistro, I really wish I had one near me.  The menu is simple and healthy, easy to understand.  Happy hour wine, beer, and small plates are fair, all priced around $5, and even offered on weekends! Happy hour on cocktails are still sorta reasonable at $7.5 considering they don't skimp too much.   I've come here for an occasional dinner with my girlfriends who live in Awhatukee.  The first time I ordered a soup and quesadilla, both were so good! My most recent trip I ordered a soup and salad, again- hit it out of the park.  While these seem like easy orders, the taste and delivery is fresh and unique -- for example, my bistro salad had toasted hazelnuts, goat cheese, and a homemade vinaigrette dressing -- so different from the regular, stale, franchised taste of Paradise Bakery or Panera.   The menu is so simple to read with plenty of options. A section for sandwiches, grilled cheeses, pastas,, salads -- wide variety, but all listed separately in categories under same price.  The 1/2 and 1/2 mix is the way to go in my opinion to get a wider range of what's offered.  I cannot wait to explore more of the menu.   I've been here twice and i love the menu, ambiance, and concept for a casual bistro with great wine, beer and drink offerings. I deduct a star based on service.  Both times have been a Saturday, 6pm dinner, and we all felt rushed, despite plenty of open seating. We were a small group of girls catching up, chatting, having fun, and we were given our bill before being offered another glass of wine, or dessert, etc. This is an excellent opportunity for the staff to showcase more of the restaurant's talented menu selections.    All in all, I'll be returning.  But I just wish the service was a better part of the overall experience."}
{"text":"This restaurant is filthy. Tabletops so sticky you must keep your arms off the tables and struggle to raise your glass off it. Restrooms are dirty. Floors are filthy. Wait staff is not attentive. Sent glass back with floaty things in it. Food lost its appeal."}
{"text":"Don't forget this place for take out too.   Picked up some salads to go from here. I need to do that more often. They have a great selection and it was just what I needed on a summer night.   Delicious!"}
{"text":"Food was very tasty and in large amounts perfect size to share. The Sicilian sandwich was delicious which I recommend"}
{"text":"I've been in the Valley for over 9 years and couldn't believe this was my first time coming here. Super cute spot, great for happy hours. Great cocktails and Mac n cheese! I definitely would come back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I love going to Perfect Pear when I am craving a delicious salad. I have tried a few of their salads, but my favorites are the Perfect Pear Classic and the Pear Cobb. I also recommend the Creamy Mushroom Marsala with Italian sausage and if you go during happy hour you have to try the goat cheese and pesto tapa. Happy Hour is everyday from 11:00 am - 6:00 pm! You can't beat that :-) They have a quaint patio and nice bar area. The only down side is I am rarely greeted when I arrive and the \"hostess stand / \"to-go\" area isn't clearly labeled so the first time I placed an order for take out I was a bit confused as to where to go to pick it up. Other than that it's a great casual place to go."}
{"text":"I liked this place a lot! We tried the south of the mountain quesadilla and the red peppers inside were really good. Also the sauce was delish. We also tried the pear tacos - bacon, avocado, and sauce were very good. Lastly happy hour gives you $2 off cocktails so we tried the peach margarita (loved it) and the blueberry mojito."}
{"text":"Super food, great family friendly environment which works for those with kids, those on dates or those just chillin'! Macaroni was great, and the grilled cheese  was super good. Owner was nice and introduced himself - servers paid extra attention to our kids. Overall great place and great addition to Tukee!"}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely delicious! There is such a broad and interesting menu that it is hard to just choose one thing! Everything tastes freshly prepared and the happy hour prices are pretty decent! The staff was very friendly and pleasant. The only issue I had was the waiting. When my party first sat down it was several minutes before anyone greeted us. After that it was many more minutes before we got our beverages. The appetizers didn't come for about 25 minutes. The entrees also took a long time. After we were finished eating it was quite a while before our server came back to give us the check. Other than the time issue, everything else about this place was perfect. The decorations inside are beautiful and it is a peaceful and relaxing ambiance. I definitely would recommend this place to everyone, but if you are in a rush, you should probably choose a different restaurant."}
{"text":"Green chili queso dip came out lukewarm, on the verge of being cold, and so did the tomato basil soup. I have the original grilled cheese and the bread was soggy from grease."}
{"text":"I had the Mediterranean salad and Athena pasta and hubs had the chicken club and green chili cheese dip .... My selections were excellent ... Salad was not over dressed and the half size pasta was huge and I took some home. The chicken club had great flavor only down fall that took them to 4 stars was the chicken was over cooked and dry. Cheese dip was excellent .... Chris (owner) was very friendly and comped our sandwhich which we returned in the form of a tip to our server. These gestures go a long way in our mind and we will return and give the place another chance for sure."}
{"text":"I've had apps, soups, sandwiches, salads, and pasta and have yet to find something I didn't love. Healthy, fresh and flavorful food served up in an open, airy dining room. Crispy grilled cheese sandwiches with bacon are pretty awesome. The salads are creative and seasonal, quesadillas are delish, and the green chile mac & cheese is the bomb!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, everything I try is amazing! Perfect pear grilled cheese and pacos pear taco, splitting plates w my mom to try more... Def yumm!"}
{"text":"Came in tonight with friends and wasn't happy with the service we got at all. From the moment we walked in at 7pm we didn't receive prompt attention a party of 5 should have. We asked the the manager finally to please be attentive. The waitress rushed our service and 2 hours later the dimmed lights turned on to ask us to leave. I moved into this area and was excited to eat here, but sadly I won't be back. Food seemed ok and the Pear Bloosom Martini was ok. I think the overall service ruined the experience.  The experience above was actually for the location in Ahwatukee. Tempe has been awesome the last 5 times I've been in. They certainly have earned 5 stars"}
{"text":"I love this place. Good food, good service, good atmosphere. I almost always get their Brussels Sprout salad."}
{"text":"The Perfect Pear is the perfect dare.   I got pacos pear tacos and they tasted like a rainbow of flavor. Seriously the perfect summer choice!   I didn't have the chance to get a beer off of their happy hour but it's probably one of the best deals in Phoenix. If my memory serves me right it is about 3.25 a glass.   I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Food was amazing, high end(prices are not), delicious, interesting, fresh. Can't skip this place"}
{"text":"This place is my wife's new love. The pear cobbler is a worth the visit"}
{"text":"My new favorite place to eat! I can't tell you how much I love this place. I ate there three days ago, and I have not stopped dreaming about this place. I am so excited there is finally a place with amazing food, and for an excellent price."}
{"text":"Every time I eat here, I'm blown away at the simplicity of the deliciousness! This soup and grilled cheese cannot even be described! On my best day in the kitchen I could not even come close to it, and I way around la cocina! ;-)"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this restaurant, I like supporting local businesses.   Perfect pear did not disappoint.  Cute decor industrial country chic decor.   They have a full bar and large menu.   Hostess was vibrant and on the ball.  She greeted all that came in.  We sat near the outdoor area so we had a full view.        Picking entree was difficult, so many great sounding options.  I selected spicy pasta and added chicken.  I enjoyed it, just wish they would have included a piece of bread or crostini.  Friend had a steak sandwich with fries, she really liked it.  We did have the chili queso app, it was nice and warm with minced chilis and this tortilla chips.   I will be back when I am in the area."}
{"text":"A friend took me here for Valentine's Day and we started with drinks. I highly recommend starting off with a pear mule. We tried the Tukee pear quesadilla. I plan on going back just for this appetizer. I would have to say this was by far my favorite thing I ate there. My second favorite thing I tried was the chocolate Berry salad. It was delicious. I tried the butternut squash rigatoni but I will probably not get that next time."}
{"text":"This is not like the original on Priest.  The restaurant is super dark (the patio is actually brighter), our waitress was not friendly and rushed us out.  I also felt like they were not as family-friendly here, also no changing station in either restroom (for babies) and the food was not like their other restaurants.  My friend got a veggie sandwich that was soggy - yuck!"}
{"text":"My family loves this place!  Great gluten free options for the whole family, even ones that kids will like, and the atmosphere is great!  Sometimes the service is slow and there are no changing stations (for babies) in either restroom - the only downfall.  It is terrible having to change your babe on the floor.  But otherwise, great place!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The appetizers the asparagus grilled cheese the macaroni the Brie and bacon such great comfort food!"}
{"text":"Awesome place with no diversity in the staff...all ladies!  Those ladies can cook!   Try anything, all good."}
{"text":"I had soup and salad for lunch a few times and were not disappointed. Good amounts of toppings mix in my salad, and the dressing was really refreshing. The Brie and mushroom soup, was out of this world. I almost wanted to lick my bowl, it was that good. I will be back to try their sandwiches and pasta dish and happy hours!"}
{"text":"Came for a quick bite had a bad meal a year ago so finally decided to give it another shot. We we're the only table at 8:15 pm. Order goat cheese and olives app came with 3 broken dried pieces of bread (end crust and 2 not even whole). Next the entrees salad was fine but ordered the rigatoni with red sauce paid extra for chicken. We couldn't even find the chicken in the dish and the pasta was cold. 2 strikes you're out. The server was very apologetic and sweet but we won't be back."}
{"text":"Yum Yum Yum!  Mom and I split the signature salad and the Butternut Squash Tacos.  The salad may have been the best I ever had!  The hazelnuts are so crunchy, the dressing perfectly delicious, and everything just came together beautifully. The tacos were super tasty too!  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Had the lunch with my kids here and it was very nice as usually. Good service, good food, nice atmosphere. I had the Sicilian sandwich and creamy asparagus soup, my son had pastas from the kids menu and my daughter had mac'n cheese. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I like this place. It is a nice quick spot for a really great priced, yummy meal. The service is good and really fast and everything we have tried gets a thumbs up. One complaint, they do not offer tacos wrapped in lettuce instead of a tortilla. For a healthier choices focused place, I think that would be a nice addition."}
{"text":"This place has massive, delicious salads. One of our regular, go-to restaurants in Tempe."}
{"text":"Lets see it would be easier to list what I don't like about this place. Not open for all meals and 24 hrs. That's it. No really, the place is cute, well thought out, not over committed to menu, delivers repeatedly to your expectations, fresh, healthy ok I will stop. I like the owners to. Go to this place."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a group of 10 people. There was a Christmas party of equal size that just got seated. The wait staff and kitchen staff handled it and made it seem like they were not even breaking a sweat. The restaurant was full not n empty seat in the house. Service was fast and food was fantastic! My compliments to the staff!"}
{"text":"Really enjoy coming here for lunch. The options are amazing and the food is constantly delicious. They have a variety of options that range from salads to sandwiches to pasta. My husband had the soup there the other day and a so loved it. Great place!!!!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch last Friday , met a few friends there for my birthday  I ordered the the  Thai quinoa  curry bowl , it was spoiled! Smelled so bad , I ate some of it and I had an upset stomach for three days!  We sent the dish back and told them that it was spoiled , they replaced it with another dish"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner amazing ,great food great workers so nice ! If anyone is in Arizona this is a definitely the place to visit.they deserve more then 5 stars"}
{"text":"This place is great! Love the menu selections and prices were cheap for the quality.  Ordered the pear flatbread and southwest philly. Both were very flavorful! Not a fan of shoe string fries but there's were kind of like beer battered shoe string. Very happy they moved in to our neighborhood! Must try!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place and probably would have if my food had not been served half froze half warm.  I ordered a hot that bowl and when it was served some of the food was still froze.  My waitress offered to have it remade for me but when it came back out it had just been microwaved which I did not appreciate and was only now luke warm."}
{"text":"So, I have been a vegetarian for probably longer than you've been an adult, and just recently made the choice of being Vegan.  It's not easy, let me tell you.  Not in this culture.  But hey, that's okay because I found the Perfect Pear Bistro. They have a great selection of vegan and vegetarian dish. My husband and I wanted to go out for our anniversary and chose this place.  I loved it; it's In the beautiful foothills of my little corner of Phoenix (Ahwatukee) and I loved the modern, industrial decor.  We had a bottle of wine, my husband had some chicken pesto , and I had a pasta dish. Delicious!  Because it was our anniversary, we were served a rich, complementary desert.. Our experience was 5 star and  I highly recommend Perfect Pear Bistro."}
{"text":"After having been here 3 times now, I feel confident in giving my review.  The first time, my husband and I went alone.  It is a nice looking restaurant, not too big, and casual enough that we felt comfortable bringing our 6 and 3 year old kids back for the next two visits.  The service was good for the first two times we went, but a little slow the third (it was a Friday night and quite a bit busier).  I often gauge the level of service off how frequently the server refills my water (I drink a lot of it), and I didn't run out.  I also appreciated they had kids menus that my girls could color on, and provided crayons.  Overall, I really liked this place, and I will be back!  Here is a rundown of what I've had there:  Drinks:   Red Sangria The red sangria was interesting in a good way.  It tasted like it had pear puree in it (I could tell from the texture, not really from the taste), and just a bit of soda water, but was not at all sweet.  I believe our server said it was made with a Malbec.  The flavors really came together nicely.    White Sangria The white sangria was notably sweeter than the red, but had a similar pear-ness as the red.  I neglected to ask what varietal wine went into this one.  I definitely preferred the red.  Mojito I can't recall the exact name of the mojito I had, and I don't see the drink menu online, but it had cherry flavoring in it.  I love a good mojito, and this was not it.  The mint wasn't mottled at all, and the drink was served with a lime which was good, because the lime flavor in the drink was so faint, I question if that was the only lime presence within the drink.  After I squeezed the lime into the drink, it tasted a bit better, but overall, this was a big disappointment.  Appetizers:  Pesto Cheese Bread The Pesto Cheese Bread was ok, but nothing special.  It looked to me like they used the same (ciabatta?) bread they use for sandwiches to make this, as two of the pieces are noticeably thicker than the other two. I would have really like to see the bread just a bit thinner and toasted so it was just a little crispy.  My husband really liked this, but I think it is hard to make the ingredients that go into this taste bad.  Chipotle Cheese Bread This was very similar in construction as the Pesto Cheese Bread.  It is a little spicy, but again, nothing particularly special.    Entrée:  Perfectly Grilled Cheese The Perfectly Grilled Cheese was by far the highlight of our meal.  It is made on a sweet bread that is supposedly made with pears (think the level of sweetness from cinnamon raisin bread with pear instead of raisin).  That, combined with the saltiness of the bacon, pepperiness of the arugula and the creaminess of the brie is a fantastic combination of flavors!  We got sweet potato fries with it, and they were thinner crinkle cut with some seasoning on top - pretty good.  This sandwich is the biggest reason why both my husband and I keep wanting to come back!  I highly recommend trying this sandwich!  Chicken Marsala Sandwich We got this twice.  We really enjoyed this the first time around.  There was quite a bit of chicken on the sandwich and it was well trimmed.  If I had to guess there was at least one normal sized chicken breast if not two small ones.  There was also a nice quantity of mushrooms and onion in the sauce that was on top.  The right quantity of marsala sauce was placed on the sandwich and saturated the bread just a bit to soften it.  The sauce itself was very tasty.  The second time wasn't as good.  There was probably about half the amount of sauce, which really made the whole thing taste very dry.  We also had the normal French fries which are shoestring - very crispy and well-seasoned.  Kid's Meal They had a nice selection of options for kids.  My girls both liked the chicken fingers - they were crispy and made of real chicken.  There were 5 chicken strips with the kid's meal, so next time we are going to have them split one meal."}
{"text":"The good - the food is mostly innovative and very tasty.  The service was impeccable as is the atmosphere.   The bad  - I ate with two other people and one person's meal was very disappointing.  She had some kind of a flatbread thing with cheese, macadamia nuts and some other ingredients.  As with all our meals the ingredients were very scantily spread around the dish.  Particularly noticeably on all our dishes was the lack of sufficient cheese.  The cheese used was very, very minimal, almost to the point of not being there at all.  For the price charged for each of our meals I thought there should a larger portion of ingredients on each of them.  including  my sandwich, a steak and cheese.  Lots of bread and not much meat at all.  I felt the quality of the food presented would warrant about $30-35, but our out the door bill was about $50.  Probably won't go back.  Shame, because the taste of the food is pretty good."}
{"text":"This place is in the top 5 favorites.  My friend and I meet once a month for lunch and this was our first visit.  We will be back!  Thank you, yum!"}
{"text":"I've been to the restaurant in the Foothills of Ahwatukee. Food is good. Service is excellent. Limited choices but they entrees are deliciously prepared. Nice outdoor sitting on cool afternoons and evenings."}
{"text":"Leaving four stars only because of an incident at the end of the night. My fiancé and I got to the bistro around 8:00pm! Super cute place and a large menu of appetizing foods! Good drink menu too, the Pinot Grigio was delicious! I got the Cuban with a side salad which was impressive! Not just lettuce and dressing! Food was so good! A family with an infant got in at 9:00 and the waitress told them they close in 15 minutes and that there was restaurants open on Mill. Everything was great up until this point. The restaurant closes at 9:30 per their website. I found this extremely rude and unprofessional coming from a restaurant background we always served up until we closed. I was surprised and disappointed. This place was pretty awesome for our first visit!"}
{"text":"Three big issues: Cork in wine glass Wrong pasta order came out  Hair in salad   Service...not great"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place! The food is always delicious no matter what we get! My absolute favorite is the harvest sandwich. The peach and pear cobbler is also to die for! If you are a local or visitor, this is a must try! The owners are really nice and always stop by to see how your meal was."}
{"text":"First time at Perfect Pear Bistro. Arrived at 4 PM on a Saturday and there were three other tables full. More filled up as we ate.   This cafe is close to the movie theater, which is great.   I ordered the Bacon and Jalapeño Grilled Cheese. The bread, nine-grain, was nicely grilled with Romano cheese on the outside and cream cheese on the inside (think jalapeño popper). The Sweet Potato Fries were equally nicely cooked. They were cut thin with a crinkle pattern, for extra crispness. Good seasoning as well. It was well thought out and creative: a really good mix of flavors.   My kids got a Quad City Melt with seasonal fruit (watermelon, feta and seeds) and a Chicken Marsala Sandwich with fries. Both were excellent combos, with savory 'shrooms and meats tucked inside the fresh bread.   Our service was spot on, knowing that we were catching a movie. She was efficient and effective.   I recommend PPB to anyone for a quality, creative meal with good service and many gluten free options."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch while traveling for work. We got greeted and sat right away during lunch. We all got food and everything very quickly. I had the chicken pesto San which and fries- very good! The other guys also got different meals and they all looked good. This place was definitely a good stop!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and drinks! The chicken Marsala sandwich, philly goat flatbread, salads, and jalapeño bacon grilled cheese are fantastic! Great atmosphere and service! Coming back as much as I can!"}
{"text":"I love your bistro and the menu is great. I'd give you five stars but there was no cider on tap and you did not have Kettle One or Sky Vodka. Please stock and you'll have a loyal customer.  Thanks."}
{"text":"Fabulous fresh, healthy choices... so many it was hard to choose! We enjoyed everything & are sure to return often. Our server, Chelsea, was very nice."}
{"text":"Delicious healthy food options, and a nice beer list to boot.  Portions are not huge but very satisfying. Service didn't blow me away but it was friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Just finished having a delicious lunch. I had the pesto grilled cheese with sweet potato fries and hubby had the Southwest Philly with fries. Everything was yummy. For sure we'll be coming back for there awesome happy hour."}
{"text":"After driving past this charming little place for a few years, my husband and I finally decided to check it out for our date night. Don't be put off by the name like I was- they do have light and healthy options but they can also throw down some amazing mac and cheese dishes and bacon is one of their staple ingredients. The scent of caramelized bacon was actually the first thing I smelled upon them j entering. Loved the interior that has a very modern look and a wall full of live plants (I'm a plant lover)...We started off with the lavender honey martini (I forgot the name) and it was heavenly. The perfect combination of flavors and was definitely not watered down, which was nice. My hubby ordered the iced green tea and went through three servings of it because it was so good. To start, we ordered the bacon and Brie crostini which came deliciously melted in a bed of caramelized sauce. We also had the g-ma mac and rosemary asparagus pasta, and both tasted great and the flavors were well rounded and tasted phenomenal! This will definitely be a regular part of our date night rotation."}
{"text":"Had dinner at this restaurant.  The food was good and Friday night was packed.  The staff are friendly.  The restaurant was loud but it is a good spot for a night out with friends.  I really enjoyed the tacos but  would have liked a third rather than 2 for dinner."}
{"text":"Wow. Great fresh and unique food at a great price. Split 4 meals and they were all awesome! Can't wait to come back here to try something else."}
{"text":"Great food. Try the Grilled Cheese Sandwich....awesome. Local micro brews. Good service and reasonable prices. More kids then would have liked....but sat in the bar area and it was quieter."}
{"text":"loved the selection of salads, bowls , pasta and sandwiches.. excellent hostesses and wait staff as well! We went for dinner and the patio was super cute with the lights."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. Came in for happy hour and stayed for dinner. I had the Sicilian sandwich...excellent, my hubby had the spicy Cobb ... Also very good and my son had the chicken Marsala pasta. Portions are huge! Three meals plus three cocktails for $50. Reasonable, great service and great food. Not crowded. Definitely a best kept secret!"}
{"text":"Enjoying the end of a long week at the Perfect Pear with lots of friends celebrating friend's birthday. The atmosphere and ambiance are great! The appetizers, salads and sandwiches are amazing too!  HH is very affordable with $5 glasses of wine and beer. This is definitely a good option!  Try It out..."}
{"text":"Service was a bit slow but if you want a tasty \"heathy-ish\" lunch give it a try . I had the Jalapeño Bacon Grilled Cheese. A good twist on a grilled cheese!!"}
{"text":"This my fifth time here trying new dishes each time. I haven't had a bad meal or service yet.  Today it's really crowded and we had to wait a little bit to be seated but it smells so good in here I didn't mind."}
{"text":"Love this little local place. Adorable patio. Friendly staff, food is really good. The salads are great, the grill cheeses super good, lots of variety. I've never had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"Went in around 11:30am and there was no wait. The value is nice for eating. Got a pear grilled cheese which was interesting. The portions are large and you couldn't definitely split an entire between two"}
{"text":"This is a must try place! I have gone twice for lunch. The food is of good quality ingredients. The portions are a good quantity. The prices are fair. The service is also good even if they are busy.   The first time I had the the chicken bacon tacos. They were delicious. Great creation. The next time I had the chicken marsala pasta. Very good, I ate half of it for lunch and the rest for dinner. My husband had a sausage pasta and did the same. Whoo did not have to make dinner. The sweet potato fries are awesome. They have several choices of ice tea. Really refreshing.   Will be back to have some other items on the menu. It all sounds so good."}
{"text":"My friend ask me \"Where you you wanna eat?\". My reply \"Anywhere with a happy hour and GOOD food\". She took me here. Our server was amazing, (her named started with a J) everything she recommended, I was sold on.  My food was savory and I was SPEECHLESS, THE beverage program was AMAZING, I let my server pick my entrée and WOW I was impressed. I had the chicken curry soup (WOW. I know curry and that, I wanted the recipe), next my meal with sweet potato fries and a svory panini (her choice), I was speechless. I ATE THE WHOLE THING.  I HAD AMAZING SERVICE  I HAD GREAT FOOD  I HAD GREAT DRINKS AND BEER ( FOR A REASONABLE PRICE)  YOU HAD ME AT PERFECT. I'll be back tho.  Thanks.  I'm a server and I couldn't complain about a thing."}
{"text":"Service was fast and friendly. Free wifi. The Chicken Pesto Sandwich was FANTASTIC. Will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Delicious salads, soups, sandwiches...all tucked right here in the Ahwatukee Foothills!  Owners are friendly and attentive, the menu unique and tantalizing.  Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"When I used to go into the perfect pear I always used to hear the owners arguing and fighting. there bathrooms smell like a new born pig placenta with a slight aroma of mut droppings ive seen employees drink before and I don't trust them cooking my food I would rather be eating at fillaburtos... Let me also state that the BROCCOLI WAS AMAZING but that was about it. I love the broccoli more than anything. everything taste the same I love broccoli"}
{"text":"Yum!  This place is so good!  Like mules?  Try the raspberry mint, it is refreshing.  Followed by a 1/2 strawberry salad with delicious feta and a generous amount of bacon.  I was full, but when the 1/2 pasta dish came out I ate more.  The mushroom Marsala is perfect!  Decently priced, we ate and drank a lot for less than $50 for two of us.  I recommend doing 1/2 dishes because it's a lot of food."}
{"text":"Walking in I was pleased with the quaint and causal atmosphere. We ordered the spinach dip for an appetizer and it was to die for. After at least 15 minutes of excruciating decision making due to their mouth watering menu, I ordered the Sicilian sandwich with a house salad and it was incredible. The balsamic vinaigrette was quite delicious I might add. Would definitely come back for more!"}
{"text":"I liked this place.  Went with a group of friends on a Friday night for Happy Hour.  Got Michelob Ultra for $2.50.  Wine is $6 a glass.  No discount on mixed drinks.  I enjoyed the olives with goat cheese and crustini.  Great serving size and flavor for only $4.  Also had the 1/2 salad with 1/2 pasta.  Got the strawberry salad and forgot to ask for no bacon so I couldn't eat it.  The waitress did not offer to remake it so I just brought it home for hubby.  Tried the mushroom marsala pasta and it was the best part of the night..  Seriously YUM!  The worst part was that there is only one bathroom so we often had to wait for someone to come out of the ladies room to be able to go in."}
{"text":"Gets a little busy at lunch but it is worth it. I'm not much for salads but there isn't one here that I wouldn't love or recommend! Excellent atmosphere, service and food. Highly enjoy it!!!"}
{"text":"I have heard about the Perfect Pear Bistro in the other locations for quite some time, so we were excited to try out the newest location that is closer to where we live.  Great atmosphere inside and out (can't wait to go back with my dog and sit on the patio), friendly service and delicious and reasonably priced food.  We enjoyed the philly cheesesteak sandwich with fries and the mushroom melt with sweet potato fries - seriously yummy!  The menu is quite extensive and I think I would have been happy with any of the sandwiches, salads or pastas."}
{"text":"I'm really happy to have this place in my neighborhood. There's really no fresh, healthy food in Ahwatukee Foothills besides The Perfect Pear. Luckily, it's pretty good.  The salads are delicious---plenty of creative menu options to choose from. You can't get bored with these salads. The soups are also excellent.  I've been a little disappointed by the grilled cheeses; they are more like \"sandwiches that just happen to have cheese on them\" than like legit ooey, gooey grilled cheese. The pastas can be hit or miss (ie flavorless). But you can't go wrong with the soups and salads."}
{"text":"I don't give many 5stars but this place is well deserving.  I had the grilled cheese with Brie and bacon on pear bread.  We also had a green chilli Mac and cheese.  If you like Mac and cheese, do yourself a favor and get it....you will not be disappointed.  Kudos to this restaurant, wished they had one in Gilbert.   Will be back though."}
{"text":"Went to the Perfect Pear on date night.  I felt like I was going to pass out the food was so good.  We had the black bean dip, Pear cobb and Pesto chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries.  To start the black bean dip was great perfect amount of cheese the gauc was chunky and a perfect flavor.  The pear cobb was excellent all the flavors matched perfect.  Pesto chicken was amazing the texture and flavor was a great match.  Last the sweet potato fries...  Well they were probably the best sweet potato fries I' ve ever had.   Drinks were very reasonable priced.  We will definitely be back.  Service was excellent and friendly.  Decorated nicely.  Great place!!"}
{"text":"This is the second time in 4 years we've come here. Better than I remembered. Worth a repeat again. Mac and cheese great. Fires tasty, and great salads. Very fresh.  Very impressed with beer list.  Was busy on a sunday, around luck time. Service friendly.  Atmosphere relaxed, casual place."}
{"text":"My dinner there tonight was very uninspired.  Perhaps I ordered all the wrong things?  Ordered from the happy hour menu -  *Red Sangria w/ extra fruit.... the extra fruit was a sliver of lemon and a sliver of orange on the edge of the glass.... a boring sangria if ever I had one.  *Olives & Roasted Red Peppers... these slices of red peppers appeared to be exact same as the jar I buy at Trader Joes.  *Hummus with Cucumbers.... a most boring hummus that I didn't even bother to finish  *Sweet Potato Fries w/ brown sugar dipping sauce.... the fries were fine but way over seasoned.  The dipping sauce was terrible.  I didn't taste brown sugar at all.  It tasted only like honey.  I asked for chipotle ranch instead to dip in and that was ahhh.  I won't be back.  To many restaurants to try... to little time."}
{"text":"Amazing. The iced tea to the quesadillas and chicken sandwiches! Just simply amazing!"}
{"text":"Last Friday night I met up with a friend who lives in the Ahwahtukee Foothills for a drink and light dinner. I was really excited to finally try Perfect Pear Bistro. This location isn't as busy as the Tempe location and that's nice on a Friday. It's also in a super lovely area. There is patio seating but it's still a little humid and hot so we opted to seat inside. We had just missed the happy hour specials which feature a tapas menu that looked interesting. I truly wished that those tapa offerings were available even when happy hour is over. As there are some great sounding tapas on that hh menu! I should have just hurried up and got here earlier ! The menu is a diverse selection of appetizers; pita flatbreads; salads; very interesting grilled cheeses such as a Jalapeño Bacon! Yum!! There are also good looking pastas and soup of the day using fresh ingredients. Today it was a Wedding Soup. You can definitely be healthy here and that's a nice change. Firstly, we opted to split a bottle of white wine. We took the recommendation of the waiter and got a nice Reisling. I would love to see a sparkling wine or champagne offered here. The waiter brought us our wine and just plopped it down on our table : no ice bucket!? We finally got that a few minutes later while ordering our entrees and having to ask. Cmon now. Our entrees were very good: mine was the Philly Goat Flat Bread. It was a flat bread of pita, carmelized sweet onion, goat cheese and mushrooms. It comes with Marsala sauce but I am not a fan and just asked that my flatbread be drizzled with a little olive oil prior to baking and that was no problem. It was super yummy and enough for a light dinner. My friend had the Creamy Butternut Rigatoni made with fat tubes of rigatoni , butternut squash, topped with bacon and walnuts and a signature butternut squash creamy sauce which was seemingly a little odd sounding but was creamy, and a tad but cinnamon and very, very yummy! We both ordered side salads to have prior to the meal. Hers came prior, mine came only seconds before my meal. Super pet peeve of mine. Great salads tho! The decor is industrial and nice. There is a small bar too and a great cocktail menu. Perfect Pear is a great place for this area as there is not really anything like it up in the Foothills. Everything was very good ... but the service from our waiter was well, anything but perfect. He just seemed annoyed with us and our requests half the time! Since I am a champagne / sparkling wine girl, it would also be perfect to add that to the menu. We did really like Perfect Pear and its definitely worth another shot :)"}
{"text":"Very accommodating for my gluten allergy and great happy hour! The servers were very knowledgeable about what items contained gluten. They even have GF bread! I'll definitely come back when in Tempe again!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I would have given it 5 stars but sometimes their day service is slow. The food is all a decent price and the serving size is huge. So feel free to share some of your dishes. My favorite thing to get is the mediterranean mac and cheese. It has pesto in it and it is amazing! Their happy hour for small bites starts around 2 and goes to 6. So take a chance on the brie and bacon as well as the pesto goat cheese."}
{"text":"This is the second time that I have eaten at The Perfect Pear and both times it has been a positive experience. I am attracted to their healthier more whole food approach. I ordered the carnitas tacos and the Greekadilla for the table and they were both a hit. The Greekadilla is a Greek riff on a quesadilla and I couldn't get enough. It came with some sort of cilantro lime sauce and we were almost fighting over the Greekadilla. Do not miss this.  The carnitas tacos were good but nothing special. I would order them again as an appetizer but as my main coarse.  I had the Cuban sandwich as my main coarse and it was very flavorful. It came on marbled rye bread which was a bit out of place but somehow it worked. I could give or take pickles but on this sandwich it makes it all work, leave them on."}
{"text":"My group was in town to watch some spring training games and we fell into the usual pattern of pizza, burgers. So I surprised everyone with the Perfect Pear, a restaurant that I had picked on Yelp, to change things up with some lighter fare. This is a great place for some soup, salads, sandwiches and pastas. We started with some hummus and pita slices. This could use a little bit of olive oil and seasoning but was passable. Also we enjoyed the starter of olives and pesto goat cheese, but beware that the olives have not been pitted so bite down gently.  I ordered the mushroom pasta with chicken and it was quite flavorful and filling. The wines by the glass list was nothing special but the Chardonnay that I had worked fine. The one warning that I would give is the grilled cheese sandwich; it had been over spiced with, I believe, cinnamon  and possibly nutmeg. This completely overwhelmed the sandwich to the point that you couldn't taste the cheese. Had it been my order I would have sent it back and I almost never send food back.  The PPB was a hit with our group. So if the menu sounds good to you and the pictures are enticing then I am sure that you will enjoy the PPB."}
{"text":"Trendy place with a very interesting menu.  What's not to like about grilled cheese options?  I stopped here for lunch.  I encountered fast friendly service.  Ingredients were fresh.....will come again the next time in town."}
{"text":"Arrived on a Weds evening and there were still a few 4-top tables available - yay!  There were only 2 of us but I need a little elbow room when I'm trying a place for the first time.  Service was excellent.  Our server was polite, attentive, able to provide insight on several dishes and even had some personal favorites which is always helpful.  She also laughed at our jokes which made her even more charming (haha).  Starter: Thai Hummous plate LOTS of veggies I would get this for HH next time with my chick friends who want to be healthy but also \"happy\".  Salad: Perfect Pear Classic was lightly dressed, very fresh, tasty.  Main Dishes:  I would prefer Shrimp with my Roasted Garlic Alfredo but I settled for chicken and it was moist and tasty and a good sized portion.  The sauce was light and flavorful not greasy or heavy.  Nicely done, would order again as it did not weigh me down!  My companion carnivore was a little disappointed not to see more \"meat\" entrees to sink his teeth into (in his world its not a \"face\" that make it meat - its a Hoof)  the owner allowed us to make a plea and appeared to take it under consideration.  Stay tuned for our next visit!  WOULD RETURN.  WILL RETURN.  Think Local, Eat Local, Spend Local."}
{"text":"I love this place! Their signature grill cheese, especially the jalapeño option is amazing. My all time favorite dish is the butternut squash pasta. They also offer fantastic cocktails. Definitely check out the Perfect Pear Bistro, it doesn't disappoint!"}
{"text":"First visit and it was great! I had the bacon and jalapeño grilled cheese with sweet potato fries. Yum! My husband had the Cuban sandwich and kept stealing my fries. The grilled cheese was the perfect mix of flavors, and just the right amount of jalapeño kick. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"First visit here on a recommendation and have to say OMG.  Menu is amazing and the food is even more amazing. Everything is fresh and tasty.  I can't wait to come and try another dish."}
{"text":"Excellent food and large portions!  Went for lunch last friday and had salad/pasta combo, was so much food, had to take the pasta home for dinner!  The bruschetta is ok, nothing like Postinos, but the bread is tasting and everything is fresh and creative."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood place. We love the soups and salad and I have a special place in my heart for the grilled cheese with jalapenos and bacon! The service is always attentive and the quality is very good. Great place for lunch or a casual dinner with friends and family."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this restaurant and I will be back to try more items on the menu.  It was hard to decide because the menu was pretty diverse and many items sounded good to me.  I went with a Quinoa bowl with strawberries and I enjoyed all the items and flavors of its ingredients.   I also felt that the portion size and price were right on.  Not only that, I felt the items were original and weren't the same as other quinoa bowls I've had elsewhere.  My only criticism is that I think different fruit should be used instead of the strawberries (like dried cherries or something) because they didn't add much flavor.  My dinner date really enjoyed his pasta.  There's something for everyone on the menu.  Service was good.  A small mistake was made on our order and was promptly resolved; no complaints!"}
{"text":"Was in the area and decided to give this place a try. Cute little lunch spot. The food is pretty good. I had a quinoa bowl with coconut curry and i was happy with it. Service is quick and decent. I'll definitely be back for more salads/grain bowls. Yummm!"}
{"text":"A great spot for lunch and dinner in Ahwatukee. The food there is great. They have good soups, sandwiches, pasta dishes, and salads. The pear tacos are probably my favorite thing on the menu.  They also have a very nice craft beer list. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Was really wanting to try this place. Food was delicious and was great at making accommodations for my gluten free, dairy free daughter. She got the Athena's garden (asked for gluten free pasta, and no cheese). We even double checked to make sure the pasta was gluten free after she started to eat because it was really good (is buttery but she likes that). We don't normally find great gluten free pasta. Service was nice as well."}
{"text":"I love this place. Everything is exceptionally good, as well as unique! My husband frequent this place, because of its reliability of deliciousness. Seriously, we have been there twice this week alone. We went for brunch as well one time, and were blown away all over again. We live very close Perfect Pear and whenever people come to visit us, we always take them there.   This place is well decorated, good music, and very clean. They get the food out quickly and have quick service. I could go on and on.   This place deserves 5 stars."}
{"text":"Was meeting my mom for lunch, and we found out our first-choice restaurant was closed. YAY - it meant we ended up here instead! I liked the restaurant as soon as I walked up and realized there were melons growing in the planter boxes outside. The dining area is attractive, with a pretty little outdoor patio. Our server was very friendly and prompt. There were several menu selections that looked good: sandwiches (including several exotic grilled cheese varieties), pasta dishes, bruschetta, quesadillas, and salads. I really enjoyed my Pear Blossom salad (pears, almonds, yellow raisins, quinoa, mint & feta cheese). The serving was pretty big and I worried about finishing it at first... that turned out not to be a problem at all! My mom's \"Greekadilla\" quesadilla (spinach,tomatoes,chick peas, feta, & pepper jack) was delicious. I was even impressed by quality of their coffee! I give this place a solid four and a half stars, might up-rate if they're as good on a second visit."}
{"text":"This is a charming and delicious casual soup/salad/sandwich/pasta place. I wish Yelp had categories for awarding stars ---  A four-star Flemings it is not; a 4 star casual spot, yes. The corn chowder was excellent, the salads different, unique, tasty."}
{"text":"Ordered the quad city melt and had to return it ,it had no flavor like eating unseasoned meat  then ordered the Bacon and jalapeño grill cheese which was better but still tasted like something was missing in the flavor area maybe needs a sharper cheese ..the waitress seem to take it personal when I has to send my order back Service thereafter was very cold"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere of this place. The food is great too, I would recommend coming here if you're looking for a healthier lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I did not see many pears on the menu, and it is a bit large to be a \"bistro\" but I will not hold that against you.  The menu is full of salads, melted cheese sandwiches and pasta, there are several interesting asps too and a few local beers.  The decor inside is a bit eclectic as this space has leftovers of it's predecessors.  A nice feature of the menu here is that most dishes here are vegetarian friendly, then meat, or fish can be added for a few $ more.   I oped for the \"Athena's garden\" A pesto linguine with a few veggies in it. It was light despite having a fair amount of oil. We also tried a salad that was well assembled and fresh.   The real winner for me was the creamy mushroom Marsala, There was cream but not an excess just enough to coat the pasta, The caramelized ions gave it a deep rich flavor and the mushrooms added to the textural delight.   If you are in the area and want a nice, good meal at a new local place give PPB a try."}
{"text":"Delicious goodness is how I'd describe the food. So far the greekadilla and the buffalo chicken tacos were oooh so delicious. I admit at first I was a little skeptical with the Greekadilla, so I requested hot sauce...oh, but the burst of flavor with that zing of spice was oh so....omg!!!...the drinks...amazing!!!....and both times I visited, the service was superb!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant with a very different menu! If you are looking for something delicious and a little outside of the box of all the other restaurants out there... this is the place! Yummy!"}
{"text":"If your menu has pasta as one of the mains it should come to the table hot, not lukewarm."}
{"text":"Really liked this place. Today was a perfect day for Patio weather. I ordered the greekadilla and thought it was perfect to share and was very good to eat. My friend ordered the tomato bisque soup but wasn't a fan of it. The wait staff were really nice and checked on us quite frequently. I saw a few other things on the menu that I'm def coming back for."}
{"text":"Have eaten here a couple of times - once for lunch and once for dinner. Food is excellent and reasonably priced and service was good. Can be a little loud for conversations because of acoustics, but overall a good place to eat."}
{"text":"Excellent, exceeded my expectations on all fronts!  Fantastic service, great ambiance, and delicious generously portioned food.  We had a South Mountain quesadilla then 2 combos...Tuscan Rigatoni pasta, Pear Blossom salad, Marsala chicken rigatoni with cream of asparagus soup.  Wayyyy too much food for lunch but we like leftovers.  This experience and the wealth of options on the menu will keep us coming back for more!"}
{"text":"My review isn't on the food of this business, it's on the customer service. I called on a Saturday night at 7:29pm and spoke to I believe her name was Sandra I asked if it was too late to place an order for pick up, she said pick up I responded yes she said one moment and put me on hold. I was on hold over 16 minutes and no one ever answered the phone, in fact I'm sure that if I stayed on the line I would still be on hold. But I am now writing this review cheers to wanting to try something new."}
{"text":"Love the salads with salmon. Asparagus soup is fantastic. Great kids meals.  Really like that it's locally owned!"}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times and have always been happy with the food and service. Beer selection is good, wine selection is decent. Ambiance and decor could use some updating but other than that I would come here any time for a good meal!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite restaurants. Everything is so fresh and tasty, yet healthy.  The sandwiches  are some of the best I've had. And the hummus nachos are a mountain of deliciousness.  The prices are a bit high, and I don't like how it seems to fall into the whole organic movement."}
{"text":"To start I had a cherry mojito and oh my gosh was that good.  I wish I had ordered 2 of those but probably best I only did the one even though I wasn't driving.  I had a strawberry walnut salad with spring greens. Fresh, crisp and satisfying. They have patio seating which is nice. Our server was very helpful in helping us choose our dishes. The menu is creative without being too far out there."}
{"text":"Brunch was PEARFECT!  The paradise in Tukee was awesome!!!!!!   Best place for brunch!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great service, decor, and fun menu. This new little Bistro is a foodies heaven.  Their 1st day had to be crazy but they got our order out in timely fashion and got the order correct.   For me: a Tino's Salad with their lick-the-bowl cider dressing. This comes with beets, goat cheese and bacon. All of which are delicious, but the tiny shred of beets would be so much better left BiGGER and the bacon was too hard to enjoy. Still, I'd order it again.   My friend: Chop Salad with their Greens Blend lettuce. Love the fact you can choose from Spring Mix or their Kale, arugula Greens Blend!   We shared: Olives with Goat Cheese & Pesto which was very tasty on crostini. Lots of olives come in a bowl topped with a delicious blend of tasty spread."}
{"text":"The food is really good, but we have come twice now and the service is very slow. We came for lunch one weekend and they wouldn't seat us at an open table because the kitchen was backed up. We came again on a Tuesday night and there was only about 20% of the tables occupied. We waited for about 7 minutes until I finally got up and asked the bartender for service. She was very nice, but again, extremely understaffed if you can't take an order when so few tables are busy. We will come again because the food is good, but we will ensure we have no place to be and we probably won't come as often as we would if service was better."}
{"text":"Dropped by for spinach dip and a drink. Good service and excellent food.  We have eaten here 4-5 times.  It is always really good.  I wish they would add just a sole burger to the menu. That would round out their offering.   Don't miss this place."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant for the first time when my father in law hosted his wedding reception there. They have so many options  and there is something for anyone. The staff was helpful even with a large group. They have many great drink options as well. Can't wait to try it out again."}
{"text":"Well, I was hoping for better.  I was pretty excited about this place opening up in my 'hood, and I met some friends here for happy hour.  The service started out on a bad note.  When we entered, there were four or five employees congregated around the front entrance, and all greeted us with a friendly hello.  However, once we sat down, our table wasn't approached for approx 5 minutes.  But, this place just opened, and I know new restaurants have kinks to work out, so I'll let that slide.  Onto the happy hour menu.  Happy hour only has discounted drinks, which disappointed all of us as we do enjoy discounted apps, etc.  We ordered a few drinks, two appetizers and one salad entree.   For appetizers we ordered the Tuscan plate and the green chili cheese dip.  The Tuscan plate was alright, though we would have preferred a mix of different meats and different cheeses maybe (it comes with a goat cheese, salami, roasted red peppers, olives and crostini) The green chili cheese dip comes with crostini and tortilla chips.  The cheese dip tasted very similar to velveeta cheese dip... which, luckily, I love.  Well, we all love.  But it's not exactly what I expect to be served at a restaurant I guess.    Camille H ordered the Mexican salad, and it was good- but overly dressed.    Now, the atmosphere.  Like many other places in this part of Ahwatukee, this place seems to be geared towards older clientele.  We all ended up commenting on the music situation, as it seemed..... well.... not very hip I guess?   I assume that the kinks with the service and food will be worked out with time.  However, I won't be returning unless the happy hour is revamped and the music selection is changed!"}
{"text":"My sister graduated high school recently and she wanted the perfect place to eat at! So we stopped in here before they closed and they were able to take us in! I ordered Spinach dip with chips and a chicken club sandwich which was amazing! The fries were way better than any fast food or other chain restaurant that I've tried!   As promised, I'd like to shout out Shauna's customer service! She sat us right away, had a positive attitude, and delivered the food quick! The chef cooked our food to perfection, we will definitely be back! Thank you for an excellent meal you guys!"}
{"text":"Great salads, and excellent service. I've eaten here twice now and both times were a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the Perfect Pear Bistro!  The atmosphere is awesome, the patio is a great spot when the weather permits, and the staff is friendly.  I've tried something from almost every section of the menu and I have not been disappointed. The salads are fresh, the grilled cheeses are unique, the sandwiches have some really great bread choices, and the tacos are SO GOOD.   One of the best things Pear has to offer is the selection of refreshing cocktails. I've tried most of the signature drinks and they're all delicious. Nike makes a mean mojito!  This is one of my favorite spots in Tempe!"}
{"text":"MY FAVE!   I'm so sad it took me so long to discover this place. Everything is delicious. I always have to take a friend with me so I can sample their food. I'm guilty of never having ordered anything else besides the Butternut Squash Tacos. YUM!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed with this place. The inside looks just like it did when NYPD was there, new paint and new tables. It's a small place so it can get loud. Menu was a plethora of choices and I chose the BLTA, blt w avocado. Super yummy and the focaccia bread was light and tasty. I love that you can choose sweet potato fries! Service was attentive and friendly. Will def be back!"}
{"text":"There's a reason I come here on the daily! 3 soups to choose from everyday, 11-6 happy hour with awesome small plates included, 1/2 and 1/2 options for soups, salads and pastas. Need I say more? Getcha self over to Perfect Pear Bistro!!!!"}
{"text":"This was a spot that a friend recommended while I visited Phoenix. I had the pear chicken tacos and they were AMAZING!!! The sauce and chicken paired very well with each other. The sweet potato fries were excellent too. I loved the atmosphere and I would definitely come back if I come to Phoenix again."}
{"text":"Had the G-Ma's Mac (Pic posted).  Couldn't stop eating it.  Friendly, attentive staff."}
{"text":"Ate there twice n loved what I ate. The salads are great the Cuban sandwich was delish!"}
{"text":"Pear Bistro is close to my hotel so I gave them a try. Their tea is delicious and rarely are appetizers better than meals but the Spinach dip is delicious! The Rigatoni was 4 stars but was still good but not the star of the show. Prices vary but are reasonable and they have some unique beers too. Service is fast and friendly! I recommend Perfect Pear Bistro!"}
{"text":"Food is alright. Nothing special. Service was EXTREMELY slow and our waitress was not friendly at all. My main complaint/concern is that the patio is overrun with bees. Customers were standing up from their tables to avoid them and trying to kill them. Told our waitress that bees literally flew into our food and water and she disregarded our comments and responded saying yeah the bees are pretty much everywhere here. Owners/management need to do something about the bee problem ASAP. Most likely will not return."}
{"text":"Very cool place.  We were road tripping and decided to stop in.  Their Pear Mule is delicious.  Also, definitely try their green chili queso.  I don't like spicy, but I LOVED the queso."}
{"text":"Really delicious food, excellent service and a great casual intimate atmosphere. Can't wait to come back and try more menu items. Great margaritas btw. My husband says hex ya to Perfect Pear Bistro!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. When you walk in you enter a large, warmly lit room with a bar lounge area to the left and the dining area to the right.   This is our second time here and a super friendly :-) guy greeted us at the door. He was the owner and a wealth of information. Have some pretty cool beers on tap so if you're beer lover worth a try!  Today I tried the McManis Malbec red. Very hardy an actually worked with the Greekadilla!  The Harvest sandwich came with sweet potato fries. WOW. So good.   We will happily be back and soon I hope."}
{"text":"The Pear Cobb Wrap and Southwest Philly were great! Loved the sweet potato fries! Definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Wine and appetizer  Wine lite and refreshing. Appetizer not good - don't go with the goat cheese and olives. The crostini was like eating flour from a sack."}
{"text":"Swung by this place due to teharu being too busy. The hostess sat us promptly and took our drink orders. They were all very polite and speedy with our orders. Portions were perfect and had a great fresh taste. Will definitely recommend and will be returning!"}
{"text":"Seriously amazing food! Our server/Bartender Chris (I think that's his name) was phenomenal, GET THE PEAR MULE it will change your life. We ordered the brie and bacon app, pear pico, pacos pear tacos and the mushroom Marsala and everything was amazing! We will definitely be back to try something new. (:"}
{"text":"Good food, good service & good wine. I have been here multiple times & u can't go wrong with it!"}
{"text":"I went with a friend for lunch on Friday about 12:30pm, the place was mobbed, extremely noisy and service was slow.  It was impossible to have a conversation.  I ordered the SOUTHWEST PHILLY, with  thinly sliced sirloin, sautéed mushrooms, served on toasted ciabatta roll, with caramelized onions & a green chili cheese sauce. This bread I would not call Ciabatta, it was just a soft roll that got soggy from the sauce. Totally a bummer, I barely finished a half and tossed the rest. My friend had an underwhelming salad - the BAJA LIME salad, that had dried corn, roasted red peppers, red onion, avocado,  cucumber, cilantro, feta cheese & quinoa... tossed with their lime vinaigrette.  The dressing was meager and the salad had little flavor.  I don't intend on returning, there are too many good choices out there!"}
{"text":"Had lunch on a Saturday with friends. I ordered a quinoa bowl with beets and squash. It was AH-maze-ING. I mean truly great. There was so much food on the plate, half of it got boxed up and went home for dinner. The texture was perfect as the dish was accented with sunflower seeds for a bit of crunch.   The menu had good options.  I'm always seeking heathy options and they did not disappoint.   My friend's dish came with sweet potato fries. I had to have a sample. They were so, so tasty. I only had two bites but I know they would be hard to turn down if I had them on my own plate. (Note to self, order a salad or a quinoa bowl to avoid temptation!)  Service was good. I asked for extra lemon for my ice tea and the serve brought back four slices on my glass. I thought it was cute. See photo.  We didn't wait too long for our food at all. It wasn't very crowded but many tables were full 1:00 p.m. on a Saturday. Prices are very reasonable for what you get.   The location is perfect with plenty of parking. Instead of heading to our usual healthy food establishment, I'm going to take my husband here.  I'm sure he's going to love it."}
{"text":"On a street covered with chain restaurants like Red Lobster and Longhorn, this place is surprisingly good find! The portions here are generous and the food tastes good. I ordered the spicy Cobb salad and paid extra for the chicken, and they gave a ton of chicken, which I loved. My sister ordered the quad city melt, which I tried and was also good. My mom ordered the Philly cheesesteak sandwich, which was average, and their potato soup, which was good, if not a little salty. My friend ordered the half rigatoni pasta and half strawberry salad lunch combo. Even the half sizes are pretty big and her salad looked like it had a lot of strawberries on it. Would come back again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for an early dinner, wow were we surprised.  Excellent service, terrific food and reasonably priced.  Gluten free clearly marked for those that needed.  Adult beverages are tasty and beer on tap."}
{"text":"I am so glad I found this cute place right down the street from my house, they have so many great options on there menu that can be made for many different food intolerances or preferences AND my husband even enjoyed his food which is a total win for me. They have a pear Moscow mule that was awesome. We've tried the Baja Lime Wrap & the Paco's Pear Tacos, seriously give those a try they're AMAZING."}
{"text":"Love this place! I ordered the shrimp spicy Cobb salad & it was so good & fresh! I'll sure to recommend this place to anyone who enjoys good food like I do! & service was fantastic!"}
{"text":"I ate here for my first time about a month ago and I was pleasantly surprised with their menu and how good everything sounded! It is very unique and not like anywhere around the area (I've eaten my way through Tempe it feels like). We are on the covered outdoor patio which was a very cute area with beautiful lights! The server helped us select a beer by giving us samples of the ones we were in between and did not seem at all impatient while we decided. The service was very prompt and pleasant.   The salads are very fresh and mixed/prepared well and they had a great pasta selection too! We did the half soup, half salad which was a great portion size. The pasta was a little bland and I expected more as far as flavor, but this would be the only reason I did not give them the full 5 stars!  I would definitely eat here again and would recommend this to my friends."}
{"text":"Went for an early dinner tonight with friends.  I had the butternut squash tacos - which were excellent.  As were the black beans!  My only wish is that there were closer to SE Chandler - we would definitely dine there... a lot!"}
{"text":"Sadly, this place has gone downhill in my opinion.  Used to be a favorite for my husband and I, for local and healthier food options.  Lately, we have noticed they have given less and less food for the price.  My husband ordered a chicken club and barely got any chicken on his sandwich and only a few sweet potato fries.  I ordered butternut squash soup and it looked like yellow water.  For $10 entrees, I expect a little more quantity and quality.  Will not be returning.."}
{"text":"This place is a waste of space. The food is OK, but pretentious without delivering. It calls itself a \"Bistro,\" which is supposed to mean a small simple restaurant serving simple dishes. This place is not even close. I despair of Ahwatukee ever supporting really good restaurants. The potential is here, but amateurs keep opening up places that either fail, or just can't deliver what they promise."}
{"text":"Love the creative menu choices here. I had some brie with bacon and brown sugar served with crispy breads for starters, then some kind of grilled cheese with jalapenos and caramelized onions along with what was probably the best tomato soup I've ever had. The vibe was cool and the service friendly and helpful. I can't wait to come back to try more items because so much of it looked appealing."}
{"text":"Hit this spot for lunch and yum!  Ordered the Buffalo Chicken Tacos with Sweet Potato Fries (Well Done) and nom...nom...nom!  Will be back to try some other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Firsts time here. The menu had a great selection. Mikayla provided great service! Answered all out questions and provided great suggestions after asking a few questions to see what we were looking for. Nice ambience, great happy hour with delicious and well priced tapas and drinks even on Sundays. Lots of vegetarian friendly options as well."}
{"text":"Very good. Stopped in got lunch and very happy. Bacon and jalapeno grilled cheese awesome and spicy. Sweet potato fries top notch."}
{"text":"Took our party of 14 immediately and did separate checks without adding the tip or a service fee. We were able to tip generously for the quality service and food.  Also, no extra charge for gluten free bread for the sandwiches! The food was delicious and well priced. It does get a little loud due to the small size and acoustics in the main room. Would definitely go back again"}
{"text":"We went here for lunch yesterday and the place is really cute, as others have mentioned.  Everyone in our party commented on how cute it was.  Everyone but me ordered a salad (and I ordered first... awkward...).  I ordered the mac and cheese which was ok.  Sauce was kind of runny but had decent flavor.  Not the best mac and cheese I've had but also not the worst.  I'd definitely try something different next time but will visit again for sure."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and there is always super delicious food!! My husband was dreaming of their peach and pear cobbler for months after. They have amazing flavors in every dish I've tried. I recommend grilled cheese sandwiches and happy hour appetizers!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite small restaurants in the valley! Perfect grilled cheese and peach and pear cobbler are the best here!"}
{"text":"called in a grilled cheese for takeout. it  didn't disappoint the food was great! the 9 grain bread was delicious so were the french fries. i'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"Great beer selection. Awesome soups and veggie filled options. I had the bacon jalapeño grilled cheese with caramelized onions and arugula on a nine grain bread. Insanely delicious. Happy hour everyday until 6, a nice little patio and friendly service also makes this place definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"This place has great food and a great happy hour! Plus a dog friendly patio :)"}
{"text":"This place has some of the best salads I've ever had. Large portions, very fresh, high quality food products in their salads. First visit and very impressed with the staff by being professional, Courteous and knowledgeable. The atmosphere is dimly lit with an outside patio under cooling misters, old time light bulbs, cabana type. The inside is relatively small but an old wood Caribbean feel with the same type lighting. I would definitely recommend this place. All I say is to be patient on the timing of food. Quality takes time, have a few drinks and time will slip on by, Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Love this locally owned bistro.  Food is always excellent, service is solid, and you feel like the staff is glad you're there.  Tonight I ordered the Perfect Pear Classic salad, a favorite of mine.   Greens are crisp and lightly coated with vinaigrette.  The dressing is so subtle that it appears there is no dressing until you dig in.  Then the delightful flavor hits your tongue, and it is yummy!  Pieces of fresh pear, Gorgonzola, red onion and hazelnuts fill out the salad.  Fabulous.  Hubby had Grandma's Mac and Cheese, his favorite.  It is a very generous portion of pasta, covered with a creamy cheese sauce and sprinkles of fresh bacon.  He cleaned the plate.  We split a side order of pear bread which is absolutely delicious.  Here is just a hint of cinnamon which gives it added depth.  No butter needed.  We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times. Everything I have ordered was delicious. Everyone I have been with also loved their food. I am from Chicago where there are many good restaurants. Out here it is so hard to find good places to eat. This is one of them. I will definitely keep coming back. The food is fresh not frozen. They use high quality ingredients. Everything on menu is good not just a few items. Worth trying."}
{"text":"Food was ok. I had the mushroom grilled cheese and sweet potato fries. The fries seems like it was fried in old oil ... Service was not the best considering there was no one in there when we were there. Probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Always serving me up with freshest grub. The Mediterranean Mac n Cheese . Great for lunch. A+"}
{"text":"Great place ! Great food (most importantly) , good atmosphere, and very friendly staff ! Their pastas are delicious ! Definitely recommending this place !!! Compliments to the chef !"}
{"text":"I couldn't decide what to order so I ordered several items, and I have to say that all of them were fantastic. I had tacos, salad, pear flatbread, and other items, all of which were superb.  Staff was very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"I think the 1/2 and 1/2 is a really good deal because their half portions are pretty big and it's 11.50.  Ive never tried anything else but I must figure figure full portions must be gigantic.   Love the chopped salad. I accidently ordered the cobb one instead once but that was good too.  Recommend chopped salad for sure.  My other 1/2 is usually a pasta.  The green Athena (sp) one is good,  mine was very oily though. Still good. My second time I tried the pesto mac. Im a fan of pesto but I didn't get a distinguishing pesto flavor.  I just tasted mac in a cream sauce.   The sandwiches are okay,  I've only tried one off of bfs plate and it was one of the grilled cheese. Good when dipped in tomato soup ;)  I saw a regular sandwich at another table and they look really hearty. I gotta say the accompanying sweet potato fries were bland,   serrated cut but really thick.   The 1/2 soup is not as a great as a portion.  They also differ depending on days but it's a good choice if you're not wanting to get into a food  coma like I did with the pasta/salad."}
{"text":"Finally got around to trying the Perfect Pear after driving past it every day of my life. Ordered a bruschetta and a red chili cheese bread for a starter. They were both fine, but I believe the weak link is the bread. Both items came on the same light, airy bread that may be better suited for other dishes. But I would have preferred something with more texture.   The Sicilian sandwich was flavorful, but was served on a focaccia bread that was wetter on the bottom than I would have liked. Again, they need better bread. My fries were battered shoestring, not homemade and were good.   Wife's jalapeño grilled cheese was tasty and appeared to be grilled on wheat. it was served with sweet potato fries, I believe from a bag. Which is fine, but she would have preferred something other than ketchup for dipping.   The service was prompt and friendly and the atmosphere was great. I like the look of the restaurant and it was comfortable and inviting.   Obviously, I'm a bread guy. Explore other options for breads, as their are many. And your menu will improve greatly. Regardless , I think I will be back."}
{"text":"This place was amazing....you have to try the gmas mac. Delicious! If you love grilled cheese then you must stop in for a yummy sandwich. Everything looks so good. I cant wait to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. We were seated immediately and the patio is lovely. Enough to get sunshine and enjoy the fresh air, but nicely covered so you're not scorched by the sun. The food was really good! I tried the Chicken Club and it was very flavorful and the sweet potato fries were crispy. The happy hour is nice too since it's daily. Would definitely recommend for a lunch out."}
{"text":"This place is packed during the lunch hour.  Outdoor seating goes last, which is what I prefer.  It's covered, shaded, and has misters that point 6\" out so you don't get dropped on.  (Love it). We had the watermelon black tea, refreshing. We ordered the classic melt with pear cinnamon bread, Brie arugula, and bacon grilled.  It was good.  There were some competing tastes.  We had the crinkle fried sweet fries.  They were think and crispy.  I thought it took a little from the sweet potato flavor to be that done.  But overall this was a good find and we are looking forward to trying more items.  Everything here is made to order."}
{"text":"What a cute place! Came here with the family and overall everyone was pleased. Kids loved their chicken nuggets and fries. Their Dad loves the grilled cheese he had (which was on a sweet pear cinnamon bread) and my tacos were pretty good. I wish there was more cheese and sauce on my tacos however. I was hoping to try the Bata Bing flatbread however but it was not on the menu. But overall this place was great."}
{"text":"I'm a fan because I love how refreshing and healthy their food selections are. I ordered from their happy. I ordered a flat bread, which tasted okay but my friend had their choice of two (soup and salad) which tasted yummy!!! I like the atmosphere. This place is good for small get together with friends or if you have that friend that is very healthy or you are choosing the healthy route try this place!"}
{"text":"Perfect pear was a good selection for lunch. I got the chicken club sandwhich which was full of chicken breast, guacamole,  blue cheese (which i didnt know came on it but was good), bacon, Red onion and tomato.  The aioli was yum with sandwhich selection. Sandwhich came with fries, sweet ir regular. My friends got huge salads and they both were extremely  satisfied with those.  I wish i had gotten salad too once i saw the fresh ingridents.  I would  come back here...only 4 stars as i think the waitress rushed us towards the end. I didnt seen the urge to clear our table as there were plenty of open spots."}
{"text":"We always enjoy this place. Nice and quiet, great happy hour menu, great salads."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place. I've heard really great things about this place but my experience here was way below standard. The food was good but was over shadowed by the terrible service. Our waitress was Lish and we had to flag her down for everything. Even just to take our drink order. She never checked on us once. The busboy was more attentive. Very disappointed and wish we had a better experience."}
{"text":"I have been here 4 times in their first 2 weeks. All of the food is delish! The happy hour is great. Good wine & beer selection. Love the salads. Can't wait to try the pasta. Patio is lovely."}
{"text":"Amazing. I am super picky with bistros but this one is excellent. Dog friendly , brought my pup. We got the bruschetta and pasta with some soup and salad. Excellent. The creamy mushroom Marcella pasta sooooooo good. I would recommend to anyone. Great place."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Trisha Yearwood - Perfect Love  Sunday morning when the menu comes Let's read it front to back and see what's going on Drink our coffee out by the patio and talk about the food That's running through our heads  When you serve me the way you do I can't help but Yelp right back at you  Yeah, this is at the Perfect Pear We're eating everything what the Perfect Pear serves We're all trying the Grilled Goodness It's just you and me at the Perfect Pear   Locally own and serving up some fun delectable food; Perfect Pear Bistro has my palates and food IQ intriqued!  From Roasted Squash Tacos, Green Chili Mac, and Quinoa Bowls, they definitely have fun in the kitchen with this menu.  I however can be a sucker for grilled cheese sandwiches and they seem to have plenty on the menu.  I shot for the Grilled Goodness; roasted butternut squash, bacon, caramelized onions, arugula, and four cheese blend on a crusted 9 grain bread.  Overall, a solid bite of grilled cheese with the extra ingredients like the crispy and saltiness of the bacon and strong earthy scent and taste of the arugula.  The roasted squash was mellow, but definitely provided and rustic sense to the sandwich.  My dilemma with the sandwich was it was light on the cheese, which I thought they could have added an extra layer.  The sandwich also came with side and I choose the fruit salad; which was good, but man the crinkle cut flat sweet potato fries were crispy to the bite!  Love me some crispy fries and thanks to my buddy that shared.    In the end, Perfect Pear Bistro had a fun menu and also afterwards I didn't feel like over ate.  Matter fact the menu made me feel lighter and refreshed.  I love their patio area which provided a brunch like atmosphere and while the interior was rustic and had an Arizona western like feel. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is one of my daughter's favorite restaurants. We tossed around ideas for dinner that night, and she really wanted to go to PP, so I gave in.  She can't get enough of the butternut squash tacos. I ordered the Quinoa bowl with roasted veggies and pesto. The food was hot; however, the bowl was SWIMMING in oil. The flavor of this dish is so strong and heavy. It definitely needed a LOT less oil and more quinoa to distribute the flavor. I told the waitress that it had too much oil ( you could see it and spoon it up in the bowl) and she acknowledged that the cook was brand new and didn't quite have the recipes down yet. But she did not offer to give us a discount or refund, or a free dessert which would have made me feel a bit better. I would not choose to go back here (although i probably will for my daughter)."}
{"text":"Yummy but pricey. We came for Happy Hour so the prices were reasonable. The butternut squash pasta was delicious- we nearly licked the plate. My cocktail was also great. We'll be back, but only for HH!"}
{"text":"Not sure if Perfect Pear Bistro was having an off night, or if I ordered the wrong things, or what... but it was not perfect and certainly not worthy of 5 stars. The menu is expansive and I only tried 2 items, so I can't say my experience is really indicative of what Perfect Pear has to offer. That being said, my friend and I both ordered grilled cheese sandwiches and thought they were mediocre. I had the \"perfectly grilled cheese\" and she ordered the \"bacon & jalapeno.\" The perfectly grilled cheese didn't have enough cheese, was lukewarm and the spiced pear bread disappointed. The bacon & jalapeno seemed to have one too many ingredients, although neither of us could pinpoint what should've been omitted.   The sweet potato fries were tasty, and the regular fries were good enough. Our drinks weren't too strong and were reasonably priced.   I'll give Perfect Pear Bistro another chance, and try a pasta or salad because I have to believe you other Yelpers can't all be wrong."}
{"text":"Great healthy food options! They have salads, wraps, sandwiches, soups and so much more. Good for lunch or casual date. Excellent house salad. Loved the Cuban Sandwich. Fun atmosphere with beautiful outdoor seating. Fast service."}
{"text":"My family and I stopped by the Perfect Pear on our way to an Elite Event and were a little pressed for time. I informed the staff and they were amazing. They took our order with eagerness and had our food on our table in I swear less than ten minutes.  I had the chicken club sandwich, my daughter had the Perfect Pear grilled cheese and my wife had a pasta dish (can't recall the name). My sandwich was great. So much so that my daughter forced me to share. I highly recommend it. My daughters grilled cheese was also very good. It had a sweet flavor I enjoyed but some may think different. My wife's pasta had spicy sausage and was ok but my daughters and I dishes were the winners. Overall, I was impressed with some very good food but even more impressive was the staff. They really went above and beyond. Great experience."}
{"text":"Met some family at the Perfect Pear and have had this Tempe location bookmarked for some time. I was hoping for a good lunch spot and was not disappointed. Interior had comfortable vibe, the staff was on point, and the food was good. For lunch, I couldn't  decide between the pear salad and the bacon/jalapeño grilled cheese. So what does one do in this situation? You get both. :) In all honesty though, I did split them with my brother. For the dishes, the grilled cheese was so good. Super flavorful and deserving of five stars. The pear salad on the other hand, had the chance at perfection but just lacked pear. For a salad and a restaurant for that matter to have the name pear in the title, I just expected bold pear flavor and as good as the pear was, there just was not enough in it. For dessert, the family ordered bread pudding and pear cobbler. Sadly, we were later advised that they were out of bread pudding. Bummer, given we were all excited to see it on the menu. With that, we added brownie instead. The brownie was just okay for me. Nothing to write home about. The cobbler on the other hand was killer. It had such awesome flavor, with what tasted like oatmeal in the crust and it was so darn good. Would highly recommend. Overall, a very good lunch that I was glad my family got to enjoy. Just missed the pear:("}
{"text":"This is a very good lunch spot with salads, sandwiches, pastas, flatbreads, etc. It's very clean inside and they have a nice patio weather permitting. All of the ingredients were fresh and homemade. The portion sizes were quite large for the price, making for a very filling lunch. The waitress was about average, as well as the speed of the service. The salad I ordered was great...butternut squash, goat cheese, quinoa, bacon, and chicken."}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab lunch during the day. It has the classic bistro look inside, and they have a wide variety of sandwiches, salads, pastas, and flatbreads. The service is about average. Our waitress did everything correct like this place usually does.   The salad ingredients were very fresh. I had the fall leaves salad with beets, goat cheese, salmon, squash, quinoa, and raspberry vinaigrette. All of my favorite veggies in one. The portion size is very good for the money.   The restaurant was busy around lunch time, and I can certainly see why. They do a very good job!"}
{"text":"The service and food here are excellent. I really like the atmosphere of the restaurant. The parking can get a bit tricky, however - so be warned."}
{"text":"Pretty good! I had the classic bruschetta and the goat cheese and mushroom bruschetta. Overall great experience. Wish they had more beer on tap but a decent selection of wine is to be found."}
{"text":"Good on point .. visiting from Las Vegas and fell in the love with the place and the food. Service was awesome to ;) its a must !!"}
{"text":"I love this quaint little spot on a side street in my area. The pear bread is so tasty and works well on any sandwich. They have a nice wine selection and even their cucumber water is refreshing. The staff is friendly and helpful and their salads and bruschetta are pretty great too. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I've been a vegetarian for the last eight years and can't say I miss meat much, but I really did love that whole buffalo chicken/blue cheese combo. Perfect Pear has hit the spot with their Buffalo Falafel sandwich. The falafel is moist, there's a good bread to filling ratio, and the spice level is just right. This sandwich is probably the most comparable (to buffalo chicken) vegetarian dish out there. I love that they've added shredded carrots and sliced celery. Genius idea! This sandwich will be my go-to anytime the hubby wants a burger from In and Out (across the street). My review is based almost entirely on food, as I ordered takeout. The place was almost empty on a Sunday night, so of course I was greeted upon entering and was helped right away. My reasoning for leaving the fifth star off this review is that I also ordered a kids meal to go and after reading the menu (can't be found online, you have to get a copy in-house) saw that it was supposed to come with a drink. I wasn't offered one."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try this place and today was the day! The food was AHmazing. We got three salads - pear Cobb, strawberry fields, and the pear classic.  All were terrific. The grilled cheese was good but the mushroom cheese sandwich was divine!! Their sweet Potato fries are tasty too. Their red sangria is tasty. Overall, a wonderful experience. We'll be back.   We are giving it a 4 star because our server didn't refill waters. Overall though- great experience"}
{"text":"This is the perfect lunch or dinner spot if you're looking for something calm, light, and easy. The menu is huge with a number of salads, sandwiches, and pastas to choose from; they also have a few southwestern options, and of course their grilled cheese menu! Order the sweet potato fries if you have the choice of a side with your dish. I've tried a number of salads and pastas here, and one or two sandwiches/grilled cheeses, and liked everything I've gotten.   The outdoor patio is beautiful, and there's always plenty of open seating. The indoor restaurant has a really nice atmosphere, too. Service is a little spotty - I've had both good and bad experiences, so just be aware that that component varies quite a bit."}
{"text":"I had the Mushroom Brie soup of the moment and the BLTA and had a hard time deciding which I loved more. My husband got to have the Pesto Grilled Cheese because they have a gluten free bread option! All around amazing. So glad we tried it."}
{"text":"We REALLY wanted to like this place because it's right down the street from us. It's a cute place, but the menu is very limited and the items we ordered were just ok. We tried the Philly Goat and Tuscan bruschetta. My husband enjoyed the Philly Goat, I felt like it should have been served hot (though I realize traditional bruschetta has a cold topping). The Tuscan was just ok.   Each of us ordered a salad as our entree. He the Strawberry Fields and I the Tino's. Both were underwhelming. We each opted for the \"perfect green blend\" which was mostly spinach. The salads were average at best; I've thrown together far better myself and the dressing on the Tino had an odd flavor that I couldn't place, maybe from the cider.  I would suggest that the \"Choose the Perfect Pear\" menu item allow for a 1/2 sandwich option, not just 1/2 pasta.  Because we want to support neighborhood establishments, we will try it again. I'll try the Grilled Cheese next time. Hopefully it will improve with time."}
{"text":"Love this place!   I've never had a bad selection here. Their salads are wonderful and the pastas are so fresh and unique. I love that they have a gluten-free option.  The prices are right for what you get. You could pay more at another restaurant but it wouldn't be any better"}
{"text":"First time trying this place. Very impressed with the food and the service. We will definitely return there!"}
{"text":"Found the Perfect Pear on Yelp.  Had time to kill for an early dinner before flying out of PHX. Server and bartender were super friendly and made great recommendations.   I had the lemon linguine with chicken, cherry tomatoes and parm, and the pear Cobb salad.  2 glasses of Chardonnay."}
{"text":"Sorry perfect pair. I wanted to like you, and there were some redeeming factors, but overall it was a miss. My friend has a gluten allergy so this seemed like a great place since they offer gf bread and pasta. I felt like being sympathetic so I also ordered a gluten free choice.  She had the jalapeño grilled cheese and I had the bacon mac.  Both entrees were very bland and uninspired in my humble opinion.    The pros are that the atmosphere is really charming and we really enjoyed the wine we ordered.  Our server was friendly and attentive as well; too bad about the food though."}
{"text":"The best salads in Ahwatukee. So unique and healthy. They aren't over-dressed, which is common. They also have a good beer selection and several wine choices. Their newly adapted happy hour menu is a winner as well. I recommend and will be back, for sure."}
{"text":"Good food, GREAT wine selection, and awesome atmosphere. The perfect pear bistro serves up lots of yummy Mediterranean inspired dishes and pastas with a Perfect Pear twist. The butternut squash ravioli is highly recommended!  A good spot for a girls night out, date night, etc."}
{"text":"We moved to Ahwatukee Foothills a month ago and have eaten here at least 1-2 times per week! Everything is FANTASTIC! Fresh, innovative flavors, a lovely cafe setting with outdoor seating with mountain views, great selection of local beers and a friendly staff. It's our favorite place in Phoenix hands down!"}
{"text":"Really good restaurant with nice list of salad option. Definitely would revisit yet would not get the Perfect Pear Martini, something was off with this. Everything was really fresh and super flavor."}
{"text":"The first few times were great, the nachos and the Sicilian sandwich are delightlful. However, the last experience wasn't the best. The waiter seemed to not care and made us repeat ourselves three times for almost every question he gave. Whenever we actually ordered, we asked for one thing to be taken off due to allergies. Luckily, my boyfriend checked prior to eating since the order was wrong. We kindly asked for it to be re-made and dish was half the size, cold, and lacking in taste. The check was given and without us asking, he walked away and bluntly ignored us the rest of the evening. Not sure if we'll be back due to this experience."}
{"text":"I visited this place a few times while in the area because I felt like it offer a healthier set of options than most of its surrounding competition.  Although I really dig the food, there's just something that is left to be desired.  Cant really put my finger on it, but it might just be me."}
{"text":"Very nice ambience as long as there are no loud people. The acoustics tend to echo with people talking loud. The food was very unique and tasty. We had the jalapeño grilled cheese sandwich and the perfectly grilled cheese. Both items were good. For sides we had the tomato basil soup and salad which were ok.  Customer service was good and the food came quickly.     If your looking for a spot to get lunch this is a nice place to go"}
{"text":"The food is always wonderful at this location. I have NO complaints about the food...however, the women's restroom-come on, it's gross!  It's dated and they halfway tried to improve it with a few paintings-which would be fine if it wasn't dirty.  Dirty bathrooms are a killer at a restaurant.  Perfect Pear-you gotta atleast get the woman's clean...I can only imagine what the men's looks like.   Tile on floor dirty, walls dirty, sink gross. Handle on door doesn't fit and there is a small hole you can see through to other side.    Food great-don't change a thing! But, please!!! Get the bathrooms clean at least...updated would be even better."}
{"text":"Great place to meet near ASU's Tempe campus. Lunch here with two of my favorite former colleagues from the college. Portion sizes were very generous and lots of healthy salad options to help me keep my New Year's diet resolution. I had the wild chop salad- filled with fresh veggies and a really tasty pesto dressing on the side. N and G both ordered soup/salad- large bowls of each. The waitress was really sweet, even went back to the kitchen to double check the ingredients for may dairy-free friend. We were there for two hours catching up and the staff never made us feel like we needed to rush out. Easy, free parking is another reason why I'll be suggesting this place next time I have a meeting with folks from the university."}
{"text":"Great menu selection with not run of mill chain choices. Good service. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I went here with my mom for lunch.  We both have never been to Perfect Pear  before and we were looking forward to enjoying lunch together at a new restaurant.   We came in on a Thursday afternoon around 12 pm and were surprised to see that the restaurant was pretty busy.  We were greeted right away by the owner and seated. Our server was very quick and took our orders and was very friendly.   The food was delicious and portioned well. My mother had the Quad City Melt and Greek side salad.  She liked the sandwich and was too full to eat her side. I had the Spring Linguini with chicken and it was good. The sauce was flavorful and i liked the amount of veggies that was included in the dish. I had too much that I has to take the rest home.  I saw other dishes served to other guests and the salads were huge and had a lot of yummy toppings.   The owner came by to check on how we were doing and we were pleased with how genuine she was with her service.  You could tell in how she interacted with each guest that she cared about how their experience was.  I noticed also that they have a decent tapas menu and a vast array of drinks, especially mules, for happy hour.  I plan on taking my husband there soon to try them out."}
{"text":"Really fantastic place. They're serving traditional American cuisine, nothing too crazy, but they're just executing it very, very well.  I had the B'L'T'A, probably the simplest thing on the menu, but it was great. And the sweet potato fries are noteworthy. Solid service. Clean, modern dining environment. Happy customer."}
{"text":"Skip the sandwiches and go with the Pasta.  The bread they use is toooooo salty.  Cute little place."}
{"text":"This place has delicious food and exceptional service.  I have been here for lunch a couple times and most recently a big Christmas party with over 20 people.  The staff was prompt, friendly and wonderful food.  Highly recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"**Vegetarian Friendly**  Great indoor and outdoor area. Also a great place for a large group. This place has such a flexible menu that everything can be made vegetarian. The have different soups each day, and usually at least one vegetarian one on the menu.   Tapas: Pesto Goat Cheese Crostini and Pear Pico de Gallo Perfect sized portions at excellent prices. The pico was a very different spin, but very refreshing.   Entree: Perfect Grilled Cheese The best grilled cheese sandwich I've had in the Tempe area. Try it for yourself!   The drinks are great too! Highly recommend the Pear Mule and Pomegranate Mojito.   PS: Happy Hour is 11-6 everyday at this location! The other locations are 2-6, so definitely maximize on this!"}
{"text":"**Vegetarian Friendly**  This place is literally a vegetarian's paradise. At least 70% of the menu was already vegetarian or could be made vegetarian. I did the half-soup and half-salad combo: Roasted Red Pepper Soup with Feta and Strawberry Fields on the house blend mix. I was hesitant about the house blend mix only because it had baby kale and I thought it would be too bitter. But it was perfect with the salad. The portions were generous and I was full far longer than I thought I would be.   The waitress handed us the happy hour menu but we were too early, but the menu looked delicious that I would go back in a heartbeat.   I cannot wait to go back. I've been dreaming of the menu for a week now!  PS: Didn't get any pictures of my food this time, I was extremely hungry!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and came out super quick. We told our server that we were in a hurry and she rushed it for us. We had the buffalo cauliflower, olive and goat cheese app, pear Cobb and peanut curry quinoa bowl. They were all delicious and we will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I always enjoy my dinners and lunches here. The service is excellent and the food is fresh and delicious. It is a great little neighborhood place!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome,  has this cute little hip and rustic feel. Awesome beer selection, super diverse menu.  Servers are super sweet.  Will make this a regular spot!"}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant! I eat wfpb and there were so many options it was difficult to choose. I ended up with 1/2 pasta  (rigatoni with butternut squash, no bacon)  and 1/2 salad (wild chop salad, no feta). I'm not totally sure how compliant the rigatoni was (could've had milk in the sauce) but it was all so completely yummy that I went home and started looking for similar recipes on Pinterest.  The meat eaters in my group raved about the food too. Excellent choice!"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic place to come if you're in the mood for a sandwich or salad. I live that they have a lot of healthy options. Their grilled cheese sandwiches are awesome and I love that they offer sweet potato fries. I've eaten here several times and have yet to order something I don't like."}
{"text":"This place is great ! Very knowledgeable and accommodating to my girlfriends celiacs disease . Our server Bryan was attentive without being annoying and all of our food and drinks were top notch !"}
{"text":"I don't write reviews often but I felt like this place was deserving of one. My pasta dish was delicious! I got the butternut squash pasta and it was divine. I'm not a huge fan of Oregano's and it was refreshing to eat some great pasta for a fair price. It ended up being $12 and it was worth it because of the quality and portion size. I'm really excited to try more stuff here."}
{"text":"My wife and I made our first visit.  She had tacos and I thought when they brought them 2 was a small portion.  I guess they were stuffed and it was plenty of food for her.    I had a salad and side....I believe it was the \"fall leaves\" and green chili Mac and cheese.    Very good food and we will go back."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, very reasonably priced, and plentiful. Service was excellent, and they are pet friendly on their patio. (Weather permitting in Phoenix, of course.) I look forward to many more meals at Perfect Pear!"}
{"text":"Love the adult Grilled cheese.  They had a Mac and cheese with chicken and it was amazing too.   I know it sounds like kids food but we asked the waitress what she loved and those 2 where what she recommended.  Was not disappointed"}
{"text":"Was so disappointed last night. We go often and generally the service is good and the food for the price is good. Not so last night. It was not over crowded, our server while pleasant enough was not at the usual quality. My Butternut Rigatoni came with linguine without my consent. It was also tepid. My husbands dish was also tepid. My butternut salad however was great!!"}
{"text":"The food here is still great, but the last 3 or 4 times we have dined in and (especially) taken out, the service has been poor. The staff has actually been rude, which is really surprising since they are never that busy. The food is still really good, so part of me wants to keep ordering from here, but the service really ruins it every time recently. Too bad ..."}
{"text":"Perfect Pear is a much needed restaurant in the Ahwatukee area. I've eaten there several times, both lunch and dinner, and each meal was delicious. The salads are fresh, and the pastas are yummy. My only suggestion is for a better wine selection. There's very few good restaurants in our area, so they might consider menu specials for different nights, and a karaoke night too. A wine tasting night would also be fun. I want this place to succeed, so fun activities might bring in extra customers. Let's keep this place in business!"}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant we chose for dinner and loved their salads. Great service and cozy atmosphere. Very reasonable on the wallet too."}
{"text":"This place is PERFECT! 'Punny' arent I? Was a little confused where to go in for my first time, found the doorway followed by a cute sunny/shady patio depending on which mood you're going for or what time of the day you decide to stop in. This place is pup friendly, which to me is a BONUS especially for my little Stella. The ambience was very chill and low key when I went, it could be a girly brunch or a casual but romantic date night too. To my surprise, it was happy hour so yes that's a thing here! I ordered the Raspberry mojito which most definitely added to my refreshing bites. For tapas we got the pesto goat cheese which was great! At first I was a little disappointed because we only got three little crostini breads to dip it in, but since our waitress was awesome she was on top of the game and offered more for our extra dip to not go to waste! We also got the cauliflower nachos which were interesting! I would have never thought to combine these ingredients prior to ordering this! It was interesting at first but then grew on me and ended up being a nice light snack. Afterwards, we ordered the pulled pork sandwich was also did not fail me. The dishes here, in my opinion are very unique and fresh. I love the chill vibes to the place and that I can bring my pup. Definitely explore this little hidden gem."}
{"text":"Loved it! Incredible combinations of food, flavor and flair. The menu has combinations of vegetables, pastas, salads. Sandwiches looked awesome. I had a pasta dish G-Mas cheesy sauce with bacon & sausage. Sheryl had a roasted squash pasta with bacon bits and arugula. Happy hour from 11-6. Tapas from 2-6pm. If you can bet here DO IT!"}
{"text":"The worst service ever.  Our meals were brought out 15 minutes apart for a party of three. Food was sub par. The attitude we were given by the manager when we brought this to her attention was to basically deal with it.  She also said bringing three plates together is \"heavy\" It's understandable that the waitress can't carry three plates, but you don't  bring two plates out and wait 15 min to bring the third plate. The manager did not apologize or even offer to take care of our tea for the inconvenience. She was annoyed and brushed us of. The place wasn't even busy, so there was no excuse for this type of service or should I say lack there of."}
{"text":"Every time we come, we come back!!! Great food, cool atmosphere! Such a wide selection of good healthy food."}
{"text":"Cute hippy restaurant with a posh feel. If you are looking for a nice atmosphere, perfect pear probably makes the cut!  Food overall is okay. I probably wouldn't come back here for more unless I was in the mood for salad.   What I had:  Baja lime salad - Huge salad with quinoa, beans, cucumbers, onions and assorted greens. My favorite item here, the lime vinaigrette was delicious and had me wanting more!   Mediterranean mac n cheese - pesto cream mac with sun dried tomatoes and onions. I didn't really taste any cheese so that kind of bummed me out.   My boyfriend had a sandwich with sweet potato fries. The sandwich was dry and not very flavorful. The sweet potato fries are worth it however."}
{"text":"Well where to start this place is shit.  The service was how can I say either bigot, racist, or judgemental.  Mainly because as a IR couple we came to eat.  First who the actual hell would pay to be seated at a crooked and lopsided table? No one.... secondly you sit us at the table that's still dirtier then the outside floors.  But that's fine because we did go else where and all us I did was cost your server 20% of our over all tab.... ohhh and if someone orders a craft beer that comes In a can Please teach your servers to bring said Can craft beer and a chilled glass... I figured this was basics but your servers and or hostess who then continued to laugh with your very weakly put together front of house then we moved tables behind us which wasn't even cleaned from the time we had come in or to the point of where the hostess had to come do her job... and everyone wants higher minimum wage??  thank god we saved our selves the stupidity of you folks messing anything else us we left and left the beer...: this should be on Hell's Kitchen can someone get chef Ramsey to help them?"}
{"text":"What a great little place this is. The selection of salads and quinoa bowls is incredible! The menu is filled with a little \"south of the border\", pastas, sandwiches and you can make any salad into a wrap.  I have not tried any of their sandwiches but am guessing you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. For my first foray here I ordered the peanut coconut curry quinoa bowl. What a knock out! It has the perfect level of heat in it to leave a little kick after every bite. They now have a couple different locations so I would go find the one near you and try it!"}
{"text":"Cute little place, patio too. I had the butternut squash pasta dish with falafel and it was yummy. Only thing was that the sauce kind of lacked in flavor and could've also used more sauce. My family liked their plates as well. Their menu is salads, pasta, quinoa. Service was alright. Will probably come back again for a lunch date and try their quinoa."}
{"text":"Perfect place to go if you're looking for a healthy, light meal! They have so many fresh, veggie-heavy options! Most of the dishes are vegetarian to start and then you can add a protein for an additional fee. I also love that they do half orders so you can try multiple dishes. I order a half salad (strawberry fields) and a half pasta (lemon linguini, with chicken added). Both portions were very large! I loved the salad, but I thought the pasta lacked flavor. I think I just picked a bland dish though. When I tired the rest of the table's food, it was delicious! Omg the sweet potato fries are huge! And the green garden quinoa dish was incredibly flavorful. I also loved the peach green ice tea!"}
{"text":"I went there today for the first time.  Between the 9 grain, pear bread and foccacia sandwiches, i spent forever trying to choose my lunch. The menu is fabulous. When the food arrived,  i knew it was going to be the first of many visits. Loved it."}
{"text":"I came here twice for lunch. I was hoping the second time would turn it around because it's such a cute little spot, but it didn't. Both times the service was very bad and the food is BLAH. Waste of money and won't be returning."}
{"text":"The Perfect Pear was perfect! The bacon & jalapeno grilled cheese sandwich was unique and delicious. Every bite offered an explosion of flavor. The fries were done just right, and did not require any condiments. The soups and salad were of high quality and very tasty. We need non-chain restaurants like the Perfect Pear in the metro. The service was great, too, and so we will return."}
{"text":"Oh My goodness!!! This place has the most incredible, healthy delicious food. I've consistently ordered the grilled cheese which blows you away. Go Go GO Get yourself some!!"}
{"text":"We love this place and go here all the time. Excellent salads. Friendly service."}
{"text":"Came out here for a couple of drinks with friends. I don't frequent this area often but I'm always down to try new places. For the specific area, this place is a little gem. I loved the décor and ambience of the place. It's definitely a place I would frequent if I lived closer to it. Drinks were amazing, the vibe was great, service was ok. Overall a nice experience."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to eat and checked Yelp as we were driving by. A great find. They have a fairly diverse menu but decided on the jalapeño and bacon grilled cheese  wow. Reminded me of a gourmet food truck grilled cheese. Had the green chili queso as well.  Do yourself a favor an go. I'll be back again.  The service was good if not funny. Try the patio, very nice."}
{"text":"Wasn't expecting much but the food here is really good. The pastas are delish. Only thing I would change is the decor, needs more consistency. It's modern but has older wall decor that doesn't work. But come for the food, not the decor."}
{"text":"The food here is so yummy! It is a favorite spot for my good friend and I to come chill for wine and snacks, or lunch on the weekends. Try the sweet potato fries!"}
{"text":"This place just opened...what a hidden gem.   Met some of my friends here for girls night. We ordered the sangria (red and white) we all loved it. I personally got the white and it tasted just like juice. So awesome!   The spinach artichoke comes in a bread bowl, what?! Sooooo good! We were pulling pieces of bread out of the bowl once we were done because it was that good! I definitely recommend it.   If you've seen any of my other reviews you know I LOVE chipotle sauce. Perfect Pear has chipotle cream rigatoni and it will change your life, haha. No, but really, it's super delicious. Not too spicy at all! Definitely enough for lunch tomorrow as well. Two meals in one, score!!   The atmosphere is super cute and modern. I don't suggest bringing little ones here, I know mine would have had a hard time there not breaking things lol.  Definitely recommend bringing a date or an out-of-towner here! What a cute spot! Can't wait to go back!!   Try it out!"}
{"text":"Love the menu. It can be difficult to find fresh healthy food done with a light but thoughtful touch--at a good price--in the Valley. I wish the thought that was put into the menu carried through into the vibe of the place. I drove a good way in rush hour to get to this restaurant because I really wanted to relax with real food and a drink or two. Sat on the brightly lit patio on the parking lot, which of course can't be helped, except maybe  for a nice potted shrub or six, but then the music is way too loud. Good music but too loud. And why would you have fake plastic plants on the tables of a restaurant that features the freshest, most interesting salads and tapas I've come across in a good while, when you can get potted herbs on the cheap at the Farmers Market? Odd mixed messages here. There is so little green space in the Valley now that I find myself constantly on the lookout for an oasis. This wasn't it, and I was disappointed. Love the Happy Hour. Love the menu. My Butternut Squash Soup and Brussel Sprout Salad was exactly what I wanted. I'll probably be back, but in hopes that the atmosphere will carry the same whimsical earthiness as the menu. If that were the case I would've stayed longer and tried more menu items."}
{"text":"Alright place, nothing to really write home about, a fancier version of other sit down chain-bistros. Decor is nice, chill, and quiet when we went on a Friday night even though there were other groups of people there having a good time too. Was kinda confused on why they sent out the soup/salad with the main dishes though... but I think that's just how the menu is setup? I ordered G'Mas Mac 'n' Cheese w/bacon on top which was good (can't go wrong with mac 'n' cheese though)! Their Iced Watermelon Black Tea was good too.  Service was slow when we went, but our waitress was nice~ if you're in the mood for a quiet place to eat by yourself or with your family, it's a nice place to go to in this very robust area."}
{"text":"Had a late lunch here on Sunday with my family.  The menu was very extensive and had lots to offer....very unique dishes and great combo options.  The grilled cheese and salad that I had were really good (jalapenos made it super spicy)!  Also, their pricing and specials were very reasonable.  I would definitely check it out if you are in Tempe for the day!"}
{"text":"The food was good, and I like that there are lots of options for healthy eats.   Service was poor, I had to flag down someone 10 minutes after we were seated. We were never given silverware, I had to pull it from another table. Waited a while for the check- all basic things but the staff was mainly chatting behind the counter.   I'll probably come back some time to give the place a second chance."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The food was delicious, the French fries came out hot and the service was fast and very attentive.  I split one of the yummy grilled cheese sandwiches and a salad.  It was better than I imagined!! We also loved sitting on the dog- friendly patio, overlooking South Mountain.  I'm excited that they have another sister restaurant in Tempe.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Service has always been great and the food is just as good! It's definitely a go to in AZ that has enough great choices to mix things up each time. Lots of great flavors!!!!"}
{"text":"Philly sandwich was super dry and barely any meat in it. Fries super small and they don't give you enough. Not worth the money. Alcohol is a decent price but no taps or bar."}
{"text":"Just went to try out this restaurant for the first time since moving to the area. Our server, I think her name was Christina. ( I couldn't hear her name while she mumbled it with a bad attitude ) literally just stared at us and was so cold. She had attitude when asked about the happy hour menu and just basically delivered THE worst customer service I've ever experienced within a time span of 2 minutes. I did mention to her that her attitude was ridiculous and was starred down by a cook. Needless to say my friend and I walked out and did not dine there. it's sad because the menu looked great, and my friend and I were looking forward to our first dining experience there. It was completely ruined and we are on our way to eat somewhere else. I'm sure the restaurant itself is awesome but it seems to me that the staff need some training on customer service. The only positive thing about our experience was the hostess. Not sure if we will be back."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise. The food was excellent and the friendly staff made it worth the trip. A return visit soon."}
{"text":"I really didn't expect this. I went to a trendy restaurant in California and you pay $100 for a price of lettuce and a bite sized piece of meat. The Perfect Pair served me a whole chicken breast in my sandwich, and a ton of carrots with the hummus. My server was very pleasant and I will come back."}
{"text":"Service is great! Food is good! As always! We ordered perfect pear salad, sandwich, with soup and sweet potato chips. Very good! Environment very nice!"}
{"text":"Love this place. We always want to come here having lunch. Their salad is very fresh, I always order Greek salad with salmon, my husband like that sandwich. We had hummus nachos before, so good!"}
{"text":"Cool spot. Great menu with tons of vegetarian options and most other items can be made vegetarian. Staff was nice and price is reasonable."}
{"text":"Their Mac N Cheese with chicken is easily my favorite Mac N Cheese in town, but every dish here is delicious."}
{"text":"I love the perfect pear salad! Definitely my go-to place for a nice afternoon with out of towners & friends!"}
{"text":"How do I begin this review. In walking into this establishment, I had a sense of sophistication due to the atmosphere. Beautiful interior, awesome customer service, smiling patrons sitting in an almost full restaurant on a Saturday night. I, along with my co-workers,  order a take out order on the way to the restaurant. The food came out in record time. Here's where it took a turn for the worse. I'd ordered the G Ma's Mac with bacon for $12.15. What I got as a watery, unappealing dish with so little bacon, I thought I was being punished. The bits I did get tasted like beef jerky. I tried calling the manager, and was told to call back tomorrow.  Military discount is offered, however, I don't  think  I'll  recommend this place."}
{"text":"Has a nice electic selection tending toward lighter fare. Perfectly Grilled Cheese has a good mixture of cheeses. Ingredients in salads are fresh. Reasonably priced.  Unfortunately the service when busy leaves something to be desired. We were billed for an item that was never delivered. When crowded the acoustics are rather echoey and loud. Some items don't contain all the listed ingredients."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was nice and food was delicious. The waiter was very good. However, I was not impressed by the owner's unappreciative attitude. He seemed to have cared less if you enjoyed yourself or cared you were even there. He seated me and ran my food out to me and was very unfriendly. He didn't even stay long enough to tell me to please enjoy my food or ask if he could get me anything else and didn't come back by to see how it was. I am a chef. I trained at Le Cordon Bleu and it is my dream to have this exact type of bistro. I would appreciate every person so much and be very attentive knowing Yelpers can make you or break you. He wasn't even cooking. He was just running the front of the house. For only being open two months I hope he reads this and improves his attitude. It's not all about the food. I really would like to see him and his wife succeed."}
{"text":"I happened to see the name of this little Bistro in a post in Facebook.  It did not disappoint.  They have an extensive menu without being overwhelming.  Soups, salads, sandwiches, and even pasta dishes.  They have a list of grilled cheese sandwiches that I wish I could eat because they sound delicious (I have sensitivities to milk products), but I just might one of these days.  We had the Tukee Pear, which is a quesadilla and it was just perfect.  I had the French Pantry, which was delicious and my friend had the Creamy Butternut Rigatoni, which I got to try and it was scrumptious!  For dessert our server recommended the Peach Cobbler, which was sweet and mouthwatering!  We went on a Monday night and were seated right away.  Service was friendly, although it was slow, but I have come to learn that good food takes time, and we had nothing but time when we went. :)"}
{"text":"So impressed by this place. We came on a Saturday night and arrived just before the rush. This place was packed! Food was great and servers were super kind and helpful. Enjoyed two cocktails, the pomegranate monitor and the mandarin mint mule which were both wonderful. The half salad, half pasta was absolutely delicious! It was definitely enough food to be filling. The happy hour specials are great. I took advantage of the cocktail deal, but the craft beer prices were super great. You can tell they're still settling in, as they're a newer place, but we totally loved the experience and will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This was my first time in. I wanted to give it a try after moving into the area. Kelsey provided amazing service and her smile makes the whole place feel comfortable.  Had a great chicken pesto sandwich, just got a little fatty on a few bites, but otherwise all was great!   It gets busy at lunch so don't expect a quiet environment for the tasty food."}
{"text":"Hot sandwich was served cold and when they \"reheated\" it in the microwave they left the ranch dressing on the plate so it was warmed up too when they brought the plates back....DISGUSTING! When we talked to the manager he did not seem surprised at all as if it was just another day. He did take the sandwich off the bill. Waitress never apologized and acted put out. Three of the four of us that ate there today have upset stomachs. So disappointed...this used to be our go-to lunch spot but sad to say we will be finding a new place for lunch."}
{"text":"We stopped in again on our way to the airport. My wife and I had the bacon and jalapeño grilled cheese!!! Oh my gosh it was good!!! happy hour from 11-6. Tapas menu from 2-6. We can't wait to eat our way thru the menu. So many great sounding items! Did I mention the wine was delicious too."}
{"text":"Maybe I ordered wrong but I wasnt impressed. The ambience is great, but they were playing EDM which didn't really go with the feel of the restaurant. I ordered the black and blue Brussels sprouts, marsala pasta with chicken, and kids quesadilla with fries for my son. When the appetizers came up, some guy who was helping getting food out to tables walked by and set some buffalo cauliflower (don't name of appetizer) and said something real fast and walked away before I could even tell him it wasn't ours. Less than a minute later my waitress comes with our right appetizer and I tell her about the mistake which she promptly removes. The brussel sprouts were cooked perfectly, but I felt like there was too much blue cheese so if I ever go back I'd ask for no cheese next time. My marsala pasta was extremely disappointing, while the sauce was reminiscent of a marsala dish, it was so watery and soupy, it didnt even stick to my pasta. My chicken was just ok, nothing amazing. I really love pasta so this was upsetting for me. My sons fries tasted better than the pasta. He seemed to enjoy his food. I highly doubt I would come back, I'm not sure why this place has such good reviews but I only stopped here because it was along the way to an errand I was running and had good reviews."}
{"text":"Just finishing my leftovers from last night's delicious dinner and felt moved to send out some virtual praise. Yes, the extras were that good. Here's the deal: for the price, the best pasta and salad place in town. Yes, there are more upscale restaurants, but for $11 total, I had a bowl of the following amazing salad--spinach, baby kale, arugula, with hazelnuts, diced pears, blue cheese, dried cranberries, and red onion, all lightly dressed and nicely balanced...AND a bowl of creamy mushroom Marsala pasta, which was rich but not overly heavy. The house wine was ok, about what you'd expect for five bucks. The service was cheerful and attentive. Overall, a nice local place, not pretentious, and very good at what they do. And yes, plenty of good vegetarian options. Hurrah!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here since it has open. Every time isn't always smooth but they do a great job trying to fix every situation...usually. Tonight we came to dinner, my son and husband. The drink I ordered tasted like cough syrup completely undrinkable, when I tried to order a beer they were out of the one I wanted and They couldn't get the tap to pour correctly on the second one I asked for. My husband ordered a pasta dish we order every time  we come. The sauce was straight water and it didn't look close to anything we have eaten before. I never send food back but tonight we did and instead of \"remaking\" it like we were told it would be all they did was drain the watery sauce and send it out again. My husband and I hardly ate our meal and took it to go just so we can throw it away. I don't like to complain because I always feel terrible but the staff couldn't even offer an apology. I paid a decent amount of money to not eat or drink a thing. We will not be back and I hope next time they can use this for customer service training. Thank you perfect pair for ruining our family dinner that we don't always get to enjoy."}
{"text":"Nice happy hour selections for both cocktails and appetizers.  We tried the Brie & Bacon and Pesto Goat Cheese.  For our dinner selections, we tried the Mushroom melt and Pork Taco.  Everything we selected was prepared well.  For me the Pesto was really nice, not overly greasy like some pesto sauces can be.  The grilled cheese mushroom melt was very crispy/crunchy like one would expect for a grilled cheese sandwich.  Greens in the sandwich made for a nice freshness to sandwich.  The folk that served us were very nice, from greeting us at the door to our waitress."}
{"text":"I'm here weekly for a group and service is always great! Always love the food and drinks as well. The salads, sandwiches, and appetizers are all delicious. I especially love the butternut squash tacos! Great happy hour specials."}
{"text":"Was in town for the Rock N Roll half marathon, and wanted a healthy choice. This was the perfect place! Amazing options, huge portions, fast service, and everyone at our table loved their meal. Can't go wrong here and anytime I am back in AZ I will def go back."}
{"text":"Decided to finally give this place a shot after their wonderful reviews! The food was ready in such short time and it tasted delicious! I had the creamiest Mac and Cheese (excellent portion size as well) I've had in such a long time!   The only thing I'd say stops me from giving this place a 5 star rating is the service. My husband and I walked in and we didn't know if to seat ourselves or there was a host, which there was one. After ordering our drinks, they told us our server would be right with us, which we browse through the menu and about 15 minutes later we had someone take our order and at the point when we were just waiting for our food, our actual server apologized and asked if we needed anything. They were probably short staffed that day, but the lack of communication was what had us waiting almost 45 overall in a restaurant that was almost empty.  I'll give this place another shot because of their amazing food and maybe it was a one time thing with the service, and would love to update my review, but it was a harsh first impression."}
{"text":"Great service. The mushroom brie soup was really good.   Chicken Club and Quad City Melt sandwiches were both yummy as well."}
{"text":"Poor service...I can't comment on the food because we didn't get any. My family and I sat there for almost 20 minutes and saw 3 servers pass by us numerous times without acknowledging our presence.  Meanwhile,  a group that was seated after us, was waited on.  We got up, told the hostess we were leaving because no one helped us and left. Awful! We won't go there again...we ended up at oreganos and were treated great."}
{"text":"Wow!  Super cute and trendy atmosphere!  Friendly and attentive staff. The Hummus nachos were amazing.  A little spicy but very flavorful!  The green garden quinoa bowl was bursting with flavor.  There are many gluten free options if that's a concern.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"So I finally made my way here today! I couldn't decide between the BLT or the chicken club, but I decided to order the latter. Unfortunately, though, I wasn't able to stay and eat due to a time constraint, but when I did eat it in my car (I was parked), it was SO GOOD. The chicken was tender and juicy, the aioli was on point, the bacon was crispy, and the bread was warm and soft; everything about it was amazing. I am probably going to go back tomorrow to try the BLT, but honestly, everything sounds SO good.   Oh and props to the server that let the bartender know I was seated at the bar! The bartender came over immediately even though she was swamped. Thumbs up on customer service!! :\")"}
{"text":"A new go-to spot!  Food: In short, amazing! Based on other Yelp tips and reviews, I ordered the Bacon Jalapeño Grilled Cheese. This was really flavorful, and a good combination. In place of fries I substituted the Mushroom and Brie soup, which was also very good. To be honest, I prefer the mushroom soup at Cafe Zupas because it has more mushrooms, but I wouldn't hesitate to get it again at Perfect Pear.  Cost: A little pricey but worth it it! My tab for the soup and sandwich (just water to drink) was about $12.50.  Service:  The hostess and server (Aja) were very pleasant, and service was prompt. And the place was ~3/4 full.  Atmosphere: Pleasant, although it was a bit noisy with the open spaces and music. Comfortable booth.  Overall: The menu is intriguing, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love their food!!! Very unique and very tasty!! Love their Mac n cheese and salads. Never had anything that I didn't love."}
{"text":"First off, I love this place and the owners are super sweet and it's awesome to have something different besides loco and native. The food seems more consistent for eat in than carry out. Ordered take out again and for the 2nd time, my order was messed up by the kitchen and I had no dressing for my salad. With a four month old at home, going back for a corrected order is just too much trouble. If the kitchen could slow down and read the orders, it would make a huge difference as the person taking the order read it back and it was correct. The food is yummy and it is a new place so there are kinks to be worked out. If they could get my order right, I'd bump this review to four stars. In this day and age of customer service being near non-existent, a little attention to detail and service would set this restaurant above the rest in our little neighborhood! Hoping for good things for this place!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, lots of healthy options, lots of gluten free options.  Generous portions, I couldn't finish.  Lots of beers and ciders."}
{"text":"Had lunch there today for the first time. It was a celebration for my taste buds! I can't wait to work my way through the entire menu. And to top it off my server was sensational!"}
{"text":"Tasty food and great menu.  Definitely prefer this location over University."}
{"text":"Perfect Pear Bistro was ... well .. perfect! Delicious food and a great atmosphere! They have daily happy hour from 11am - 6pm that includes great drink prices and a fun tapas menu. The menu is a mixture of healthy options and comfort food, so it's really great for anyone!"}
{"text":"This location is definitely better than the Ahwatukee  Foothills location. PP offers great salads and bruschetta."}
{"text":"If you are looking for variety at lunch, then this is your place. There are 60 combinations of salads and 50 combinations of pastas. You could choose a different combination of 1/2 salad & 1/2 pasta once each day, and it would still take over eight years to complete the entire delicious 3000 meal sequence!  Included in calculations: salad with choice of greens and extra protein (or no extra protein) as well as pasta with choice of extra protein (or no extra protein).  Excluded from calculations:  gluten free pasta option since a person would probably not switch between these (as well as any other potential substitutions).  Vegetarians have 200 combinations of 1/2 salad & 1/2 pasta which is still enough to keep you occupied for quite a while.   If you are not in the mood for salad or pasta, then check out the full menu for many other options.   Plus, the menu has many options that kids would enjoy.   P.S.  It has been a while since I calculated combinations (or, God forbid, permutations). If you find an error, please let me know and I would be happy to credit you with any corrections. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Amazing pairings that leave your mouth drooling for more! Highly recommend the fall salad, the lemony pasta and the best grilled cheese in town."}
{"text":"Decent place and ample parking space available. Cocktails are good and made strong:) fried chillies are tangy and salty .. Excellent place for happy hour as everything on happy hour menu is $5.00 not crowded and good service."}
{"text":"I am not a salad person, so you should know that when I say the salads here are nothing short of amazing, you can believe me. My favorite is the Baja Lime salad."}
{"text":"Brought a group to perfect pear of maybe 30 people. Gave them 24 hours notice of our reservation and gave our orders 24hrs in advance. I have never experienced more passive service in my life. The last person in our group received their meal TWO HOURS after we arrived at the restaurant. And not once did the server apologize for the service until the very end of the night. We received all of our meals in plastic containers and had at least 6 or 7 appetizers that never got delivered.   I've never experienced such horrible service in my life and the manager didn't even show his face to apologize until we had our check. I understand a group of 30 is large but don't commit to having us in your restaurant if you can't handle it.   My chicken didn't even have salt on it lol"}
{"text":"Great fresh food at a low price. Portions are right in line. Fresh made soups of the day. \"Mushroom and Bree\" is very good!!! Friendly wait staff. Great at atmosphere. My only complaint is that there are no after food mints or candies."}
{"text":"Not a family-friendly place...very \"business lunch\" feel...food was good but took a long time.  Pricey for grilled cheese sandwiches, IMO, but the bacon was thick, the fries were pretty good.  It was $75 for the 4 of us, and we just had pasta and grilled cheese...seemed like a lot for a lunch.  Service was friendly and pretty attentive."}
{"text":"Visiting from California and decided to stop off here!!! OMGGGG WHAT A GREAT CHOICE! Friendly staff, clean restaurant inside and out, DELICIOUS/HEALTHY/GLUTEN FREE OPTIONS.... Needless to say, I LOVED IT! I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Seriously the food is perfection every time I eat here. Awesome little bar inside too. Perfect unwind lunch spot. Must try the Marsala pasta with chicken!!!"}
{"text":"I work in food service and what happened today at perfect pair was completely unacceptable. I sat for almost 20 minutes after originally being seated without my table being approached by a server. The servers touched multiple other tables around us and even directly next us. I have no feedback on the food as i left after this incident but would definitely not recommend perfect pair based on the service alone"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good drinks, fantastic service and impressive gluten-free options. They can pretty much make anything on the regular menu gluten free which is uncommon however very appreciated. We go to the north Tempe location frequently and it never disappoints. The pear mule is a go-to complete with real pieces of pear in the bottom. They do take reservations, it doesn't usually seem to be necessary but that might change with spring training coming so it's not a bad idea. The decent prices are an added bonus."}
{"text":"We were so excited to come here because we had heard so many things. The food was amazing!! But the service was HORRIBLE!! We came at 11 am on a Saturday Morning (March 3rd) just as they were opening. I didn't even get the server's name as she was so hard to track down. She had brown hair in a braid. She never smiled, never told us about anything special being this was our first time, never stuck around for even one second after dropping off drinks or appetizers. We would have to constantly go find her to order more. This seemed very strange as there was only 2 other tables in the restaurant. One of which was also chasing her around for service!!  COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE!!! Maybe she was having a bad day but I'm also a server and bartender and that was no excuse. She needs to be completely re-trained."}
{"text":"What a great find.  We were looking for a place to dine al fresco and found this lovely place.  They had lots of options with healthy choices to eat.  The food was tasty and we had great service.  I would definitely return."}
{"text":"one of Ahwatukee's best  Love this place - try the BLTa"}
{"text":"Great stop for lunch.  They have a great assortment of options on there menu.  I have yet to leave unsatisfied.  I would definitely refer a friend"}
{"text":"Great food and environment.  Perfect spot for lunch.  Every person I have taken here has left satisfied with meals and service.  Try it out."}
{"text":"Fresh, healthy, delicious food! The staff is very friendly and the owners are awesome. Everything on the menu is delicious but there are a few things you must try if you come here- Creamy Mushroom Marsala Pasta, Perfectly Grilled Cheese,Wild Chop Salad,and theTuscan Bruschetta! Great selection of wine and beer."}
{"text":"I was visiting my hometown of Phoenix with my brother abd uncle and to pass the time on current ongoing traffic we stopped here to satisfy our dinner time cravings. I ordered the B.L.T with avocado and it was such a delicious sandwich I would try again. Waitress was kind as well as gorgeous. By the end of our meal I was deeply satisfied; taste buds amazed. This is just of many original restaurants I have yet to re-discover since I moved from Phoenix to Naperville, Illinois, and I have not had In-N-Out Burger in almost 12 years!"}
{"text":"First time here and I loved their Baja Lime Blend House Salad with chicken. I would like to come back and try their tacos or grilled cheese. My friend who had the tacos said where tasty!"}
{"text":"Cool place. Wife and I stopped by to grab a bite and a drink. She ordered the Cobb salad and a glass of sav blanc and I went with the 1/2 perfect pear salad with 1/2 mac n cheese dish. Added a local lager to wash it all down. Service up front was great. Our server was quick with the first round of drinks and taking our order. She kind of disappeared after that. We had other staff bringing a 2nd round of drinks and delivering the food.   Salads were divine. Fresh, crisp greens and full of flavor. I'd recommend the pear salad. The Mac n cheese dish was also delicious. A perfect blend of creamy and cheesy, served piping hot. It was an easy dish to finish, portions were perfect for the \"pick 2\" meal. The menu had some other tasty looking offerings so there's good reason to come back again. The restaurant was an old NYPD Pizzeria but owners did a nice job styling it to their own. It's what you see a lot nowadays with exposed ceiling, brick, black/white motif.   Wife and I will be back again."}
{"text":"Service was great, menu had a lot of great options, and it was very cute inside and outside. I had the chicken club with sweet potato fries, and it was just OK. I would come back to try other things."}
{"text":"Atmosphere good Food under cooked and under seasoned (way under seasoned) Has a lot of potential but the kitchen needs some direction"}
{"text":"Service was incredibly slow. Our waitress was prepping and cleaning between waiting tables, but for way too long. We had to flag her down several times. If I weren't there with my mom, I would have probably stood up and walked up to her, but I tried to be polite.   The bad service really overshadowed the food, which was actually not bad. We split the chicken club sandwich with sweet potato fries (extra crispy). I liked how the sweet potato fries were crinkle cut, which is a rare find. I thought the chicken club was good, but needed more chipotle aioli. I waited quite a long time for our waitress to do that whole thing that they usually do where they check on you not long after they give you the food, hoping I'd be able to request the extra aioli at that point. My mom was practically done with her food by the time we got the girl's attention.   If you order food, get it To Go."}
{"text":"We have now experienced Happy Hour, Brunch, Lunch and Dinner at Perfect Pear Bistro in its original Ahwatukee Foothills location and can't say enough good things about it.  Last Friday we tried the new location in Tempe, which features beer and wine ON TAP, and the same awesome menu as the Ahwatukee location. Every experience has been wonderful, the food is fabulous, the service is stellar, and there are still things on the menu I haven't tried. Phoenix diners, you have GOT to check this place out. While the original Foothills location may be a haul for some of you, the Tempe location on the SE corner of Ray and Priest is convenient for many of you! Check it out and share! This place is truly a gem and we hope it succeeds!"}
{"text":"We get takeout here ALL. THE. TIME. It's fast and so delicious. My go-to is the Cobb salad and if I want a little extra the mac n cheese."}
{"text":"Appallingly poor service. Food was outstanding. We ate at the bar and two bartenders were extraordinairily  condescending. We come here often and have always been amazed at the service and food. No one would clear our plates and the server would not bring the bill around. They were not that busy on a Saturday night between 7 and 8. Food and drinks were killer."}
{"text":"Great low key spot in the Foothills.  Awesome happy hour specials and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"We did a quick search for a lil lunch spot after trip down to Ikea.  Thankfully, the Perfect Pear Bistro popped up!!  We did a once over on the menu and it sounded good, so we headed over.  We were treated quickly and told we could sit anywhere.  Once we nestled up to a high top, menus were promptly set out and drink orders taken... two iced teas on this warm Saturday afternoon.  I tried the Marbled Cuban and my wife tried the Chicken Pesto sandwich, both ordered with Sweet Potato fries.  The meals arrived well portioned and prepared.  We both were taken back by the fries.  They were so good, were ordered more to go!  Thanks for a great lunch!  We will keep any eye out for more locations, hopefully a lil farther North...?"}
{"text":"Mouth Fist Manifesto:  this place is so good, it made me want to mouth fist myself to continue enjoying the deliciousness still clinging to my buttery, peary appendage.   Butternut squash tacos with quinoa, feta, grilled corn. Flatbread with pear, bacon, goat cheese, hazelnuts. Pear bread grilled cheese with bacon and arugula.   Pear Martini?  Check. Pear French 75?  Double check.   Locally owned and intimate. I just peared in my mouth.... and I liked it."}
{"text":"Very cool, rustic and intimate atmosphere. Great service, easy parking, good prices ($9-$13), food is delicious, unique and many healthy options as well. The 6 of us (ages 23-57) all loved what we got and had soups, salads, sandwiches, and a specialty grilled cheese. Oh their fries! Looked like they also had good tacos, quinoa bowls wraps and a good variety of beer and wine. We ate inside but they had a nice patio."}
{"text":"Have eaten here once and gotten takeout half a dozen times.  Food is always fantastic.  Service was solid too.  One thing missing from my local spots was some decent pasta and this place hits the spot.  Very friendly GM/owner that makes sure you are taken care of.  Genuinely looking for that feedback, which is the key to the places that stick around.  I hope it does.  Definitely worth a try.  Some of what we have had most recently are the Mac N Cheese, Chicken Marsala and a few soups.  All very tasty and quite rich.  You will fill up fast and have some tasty leftovers.  As a bonus they had some nice cocktails and a solid beer selection.    While we left before they performed there were some people setting up for music, so there is that if you are into a little live music while dining.  This has inserted itself into heavy rotation."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch and so glad we did! I had the Green Garden Quinoa Bowl and it was amazing! My hubby had a BLT with avocado and it was awesome. Nice beer selection, excellent service and we were able to sit outside on the patio - bonus!  Would definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"I am mad I didn't find this place earlier. The menu is unique but reliable in that everyone would be able to find something they love. The salad we got was amazing as were the buffalo chicken tacos. I loved how they also had small plates/tapas for like $3 each. The prices here are so reasonable especially compared to similar chains with lower quality food and higher prices."}
{"text":"I think Perfect Pear Bistro is so cute and fun! After looking at the menu online, it was easy for my family to agree on this restaurant. It is affordable and they offer a great selection of foods... I'm talking anywhere from pasta to tacos. It was a Saturday afternoon, not very busy, and our server was pretty on top of things!  I've been here several times and I don't think the food is the most amazing thing, but it definitely is tasty. The staff, accessibility, ambiance, and reasonable prices keep me coming back. Since I haven't found a menu item that I'm CRAZY about yet, I got a little creative with what I ordered. I asked for the chicken pesto sandwich but in form of a wrap with spinach and other greens bundled inside. VERY tasty. Loved the fact that they were able to make this accommodation for me. I have now found my new favorite thing and will continue comin' back for it!   Give Perfect Pear a try if you're looking for a quick, nice lunch or dinner fix!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I sat outside and had a lovely meal. The misters were peaceful as well as the ambiance. We ordered blueberry beers (recommend) as well at the pesto goat cheese and olives with crostini to start. Wow! The goat cheese and olives were so flavorful. Next we ordered the Cuban with half sweet potato fries half regular fries and the Jalapeño grilled cheese with tomato soup. Wow! Again so much flavor! I was really blown away by the food and menu options. The perfect pear was perfect!"}
{"text":"From out of town with a group of co-workers.  We each had salads with chicken added.  The salads were fresh and beyond excellent! The spinach dip was pretty tasty as well.  Prompt and courteous service too!"}
{"text":"Went to perfect pear because it was so close to gammage.  It was so good and very nice atmosphere. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! The food is incredible and the atmosphere is perfect! Can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"Solid review. Salads are well crafted. Cool looking decor. The potato soup is really good.  Overall I like the place and I look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp while in Tempe and was extremely happy that we did. Found the food service a bit slow for a relatively not-busy weekday lunch visit but once the food reached the table all that time was forgotten as our tongue entered taste bliss!"}
{"text":"A must try!!  if you like fresh food. I too rushed home to write a review but with a totally different take from earlier reviewer.  This place is great!  Love love loved it!  I will definitely be a regular here.   There were 5 of us that stopped in for lunch but told them that we were really short on time.  Top quality service. Great servers who know what they are doing.  The food was outstanding and I'm a picky foodie.  Loved the French onion soup with 1/2 strawberry salad.  The iced tea was so refreshing! They even willingly split our checks 5 ways and they even performed well on time.  We left just 25 minutes later, full and satisfied.  We hope this new restaurant does well.  Support your local small business:)"}
{"text":"Amazing place wish they served the mushroom bre soup more enjoy wine with my soup late night"}
{"text":"Hosted a bridal shower for my niece on a Saturday afternoon at the Awautukee location. The service was excellent, the food was fabulous and we had a great time overall. They made me look great!! :-)"}
{"text":"We have been going to the Perfect Pair once or twice a week since it opened. It is a great addition to our area and has quickly become our favorite place.  The food is excellent and the service is outstanding. The Happy Hour is great - first class wines for $6. Weekend brunch is a great value. I agree with one of the other reviewers - the grilled cheese is fantastic. We enjoy taking our kids and grandkids there. It is really a family friendly place."}
{"text":"I came here with my daughter for lunch one Saturday. We made it just before the lunch rush, so we were sat, and tended to quickly. My daughter ordered mac and cheese,  I had the mushroom masala pasta, and a bowl of the coconut chicken curry soup. The food was outstanding, the blend of flavors unique and delicious.  Portions were satisfying without being too big. Friends have been telling me to visit  Perfect Pear Bistro for quite some time now, and I'm glad I finally did. I can't wait to come back and try  more of their menu!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a business lunch when I was in town.  A nice little bistro with indoor and outdoor seating.  They were packed for lunch, and while we were seated fairly quickly, the wait staff was a little slow in getting us drinks and grabbing our order.  Probably not a place to grab a 'quick' lunch, but with how busy they were, it was forgivable.  Their menu has a number of vegetarian and gluten free items, and everything is freshly made.  I opted for their 'Perfectly Grilled Cheese', and it was a great spin on a classic grilled cheese.  Two thick pieces of their spiced pear bread gave it a slightly sweet taste countered by the bacon and four cheeses.  Not your average grilled cheese sandwich.  Perfect portion for lunch.  I would definitely stop back in."}
{"text":"We went for an early dinner with our 3 kids, ages 3,6, 9. Kids menu is good. We had guacamole and buffalo cauliflower. Both were delicious! Mediterranean salad was delicious and large. My husband had the mushroom melt and loved it. Grapefruit shandy beer was also yummy! Great ambiance, highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I got the Green Garden Quinoa Bowl and it is a large portion!  The veggies tasted so fresh and the pesto is delicious!  Our waitress was very friendly and when my friend asked for coffee to go, even though they didn't have to go coffee cups she went out of her way to find something to put it in!  The atmosphere was also great-easy going and nice for a casual bite to eat.  Although I didn't have any drinks, they sounded awesome-on par with current creative trends and they had a good craft beer selection as well.  Next time!"}
{"text":"They have five different grilled cheese sandwiches! And they are all very delicious! They rank in the following order:  1) Perfectly grilled cheese Also 1) Bacon & jalapeño (I can't decide which one is better. This one is gooey and has the perfect amount of spice) 3) Pesto 4) Grilled goodness 5) Mushroom melt  Also, the sweet potato fries are so good. I don't even like sweet potato fries and will always choose regular fries over them, but not at Perfect Pear."}
{"text":"Mmmm pear bread. My friend said it was so good that \"I want to marry this bread. We need to make this happen.\" Pear bread, perfectly toasted, meshed with brie+ four-cheese blend, bacon, and arugula. One of the best sandwiches I've had in a while! There was a balanced compliment of textures, from the slight crunch of the toasted bread, creaminess of the cheese, and cool crispness of the arugula. Flavor wise, it was equally balanced. The light, spiced pear taste went well with the smoky bacon and mild cheese.  There was a small hiccup with receiving our drink orders, but other than that service was great.  Definitely a place to go to again to try more delicious sandwiches."}
{"text":"Wow. Ok so even though I'm trying not to eat carbs, I ordered the lemon garlic linguini with shrimp and it has asparagus and I felt like I died and went to heaven. So being from the east coast where the food is amazing, this place definitely measures up. Right on Pear Bistro; you go with your bad self!!!!!"}
{"text":"Cute quaint restaurant. A few unusual sandwiches and salads. I ordered chicken marseille sandwich. It was dry and not much flavor. Service was good. No regular ice tea available."}
{"text":"I love, love, love the food here. I prefer this location to the one in Tempe, because it tends to be a little quieter. The Strawberry Fields salad is my favorite, and I love the pesto pasta. I have really enjoyed everything I've ordered here."}
{"text":"Good sized portions but nothing that's wows. Go for the salads instead of the sandwiches."}
{"text":"Dined alone after a business meeting in Tempe. Fantastic fresh and grilled veggies with cold quinoa salad, nice mid-price wine selection, and charming service. Very comfortable place to read and relax over coffee, too."}
{"text":"Good food, especially for vegan/vegetarian peeps, and there was a pretty sweet drink list. My bf was a little let down by his choice but he's a picky eater so I'll take his opinion with a grain of salt. I'd like to visit again to try some more menu items and see if I can find a favorite!"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch. It was a last minute decision that we were excited about, a little mixed on my feelings though. I got a the buffalo chicken tacos...they were good, although I would order something else  next time. Boyfriend got the marbled Cuban, it was really good. Our service was rather slow and non-existent at time for a very long period of time. This sucked because we sat at the bar for the very reason of quick service. They were literally having a meeting behind the bar with a lady with a folder and a pen discussing their payroll right in front of us rather than attend to us and take our order. I know this is a small place but please, hold these meetings on the beautiful patio or before/after hours and pay attention to your patrons. With that being said, the food quality was good, the portions were good and that about sums it up."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times,  and ordered different items.  Everything had been freshly made and delicious.  Generous portions.  Very nice selection,  good prices."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good! Got the chicken club with sweet potato fries. Both were very tasty and I love the cut on the fries. Server was very busy the entire time and treated us more like another table and didn't really provide anything special. Interesting decor inside but the bathroom was really dirty.  Worth another visit because I think they were on an off day but the food was on point"}
{"text":"I have never ordered a grilled cheese sandwich at a restaurant  but it a specialty here .  We also had the shishito peppers appetizer and the Fall Leaves salad.  Every thing was wonderful!  Glad there is a Tempe location."}
{"text":"I stopped by this new restaurant for lunch with a friend. They seem to specialize in signature grilled cheese but I think \"signature\" must translate into \"contains bacon\" as 3 of the 5 options had that as a key ingredient.   I had the bacon and jalapeño. It was tasty but fell short in the heat category and was a bit on the grilled but not crisp category. Service was prompt and friendly, but the music on the small patio was a little bit loud for a good conversation.   I will come back and give it a try. They do have happy hour from 11-6 pm which includes some featured tapas along with $5 wines by the glass"}
{"text":"Yay! A HEALTHY almost all vegetarian sandwich, salad, soup and pasta place! I have been here 3 times and I have loved almost everything I have ordered. My favorite was the harvest sandwich and all their soups and salads are amazing. The only thing I didn't care for was the guacamole. It wasn't guacamole at all, just a bunch of bland cut up avocado that annoyingly fell off my chips. I took it home and made \"real\" guacamole with it myself so it wasn't a total waste.   I love the atmosphere and the wait staff was very friendly. I wonder how much rent would be if I moved in?"}
{"text":"First time here.  It is great to have a restaurant close to home that serves fresh tasting food with great flavor.  Server was friendly and efficient.  Could not have asked for a better first experience.  Nice variety of Salad/Sandwich/Pasta. I had the  Amatriciana with Chicken.  Pasta was perfect and the bacon sauce had just the right amount of spice. I wish I could have finished the bowl.  Wife had the Creamy Mushroom Marsala.  Another excellent dish that delivers the savory/sweet of any good Marsla dish. Again, pasta was cooked perfect. I would recommend either of these and look forward to trying the other dishes.    I will definitely be back and pray locals recognize a good restaurant and help support it."}
{"text":"Not impressed. I ordered the quad city grilled cheese , sweet potato fries, black and blue roasted brussel sprouts and peach pear crumble al-la-mode. The bread on the quad city was soaked and the sandwich had zero flavor. Quad refers to the cheese blend; the cheese either absorbed into the bread or didn't exist. The brussel sprouts were supposed to be an appetizer. They arrived on a platter, it was huge. If I was shopping for brussel sprouts I would never purchase this many. They were hard and under cooked. They needed a few more minutes in the skillet. The peach pear crumble al-la-mode was sublime. I want more!  They had an extensive list of salads. I will try again and get a salad and the peach pear crumble al-la-mode. The service was efficient and curt. The server had no time for extra words or pleasantries.  She was prompt and polite when  refilling my drink. Overall the service was good, the food not so good. This rating is 1 star mostly for the desert."}
{"text":"Ok, lack fresh flavors they promise. I am sure at one time this was the shit conceptually. Now it is uninspired and running on fumes. Good service but flat food.   Bar looks sad"}
{"text":"Drove by and turned around to try this place out. Love the decor the have. Sat outside at night and with the misters on it was nice. We ordered a sandwich and a grilled cheese. Both were delicious. But the sweet potato fries were Delicious! Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Really good food and equally great service.  Their chicken pesto sandwich is amazing and I was very impressed with the crunchiness of their sweet potato fries.  Those type of fries are usually soft or soggy.  This place had really good ones."}
{"text":"Love, love this restaurant!  Food IS made from scratch and amazing.  Unique menu items as well as many standard items. Love their variety of macaroni and cheese specialty dishes.  Great happy hour; excellent prices, food and wine!  The owners are local and very friendly.  One of my favorite restaurants of all times."}
{"text":"My husband loved his Fall Leaves Salad. The service and all of the other food (and drinks) were very good. They serve the local Four Peaks beer including the Peach Ale. I had a raspberry mint mule that was really good as well. We started with a delicious roasted cauliflower with spinach dip off the happy hour menu. My wild chopped salad with chicken, which was not dry, minus the red onions was also really good as a wrap."}
{"text":"The table was sticky. If they wiped it down at all, they must have used a nasty old rag.  I had the BLT-A sandwich. Hard to mess up a BLT, but they did their best. Foccia flatbread is too heavy and overwhelms the rest. Plus, why would you use bacon crumbles in a sandwich?  Is it your intention to have all the bacon fall out all over the plate and your lap?  Really poor design.   At least the server was nice!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service and reasonably priced. I had a pumpkin martini and my husband had the pear mule. Both were good. I normally don't seek out for salads but I decided to get 1/2 salad and  1/2 pasta. Which I love that they allow this option so I  can try a couple different things. The pasta I had was spicy but good. The salad tasted healthy, of course, but was good with the chicken added. My husband ordered the pesto grilled cheese which was really good too. I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love coming here and we love the food... but tonight we came in for dinner and we weren't as pleased. I'm not sure if there was a different chef, but I always order the roasted sprout salad in a wrap but tonight it came out and there were no Brussel sprouts which is the reason I order it!! The wrap was also broken and was falling apart in my hand..... my boyfriend always orders the garden green quinoa bowl with chicken, and this time there was SO much oil.... it looked like a soup at the bottom of the bowl like there was probably 1/4 cup of oil at the bottom. We still love this place, but we were disappointed tonight."}
{"text":"I was at their grand opening in Ahwatukee and they have the most amazing food and the service and owners are wonderful.  A definite must try.  So happy to see they are opening in other locations."}
{"text":"Ambiance: Very subtle, well thought out to bring out comfort and ease to customers. The photo taken from the seat I was at could've been mistaken for a restaurant overseas. Service: Does not exactly have the A-game on. We got here at 45min before closing with only 2 other tables indoors. The water/wine girl ended up getting our order in and disclosed she was not confident if she could get it right. The salad came within a reasonable time, but the mains came right after before we could finish our salad. 15min before close, as I'm finishing my pasta, the server dropped off the bill without asking if we need anything else (more drinks, dessert, etc) Food: For the price of $12.49 and getting a decent sized salad and pasta at a full service restaurant, there's not much to complain. Not a full flavor, but was fresh. Definitely packaged  pasta was used. No fresh ground pepper or parmesan is offered. Table side salt and pepper is hard to come out. Grilled cheese was good with pesto and vegetables, but timing of food lost the gooey aspect."}
{"text":"Great little place. The patio is very quaint and enjoyable.  The service is wonderful everyone is very helpful. The food is delicious and there are great options to put salads into wraps, and mix and match items. The sweet potato fries and amazing.  Also great gluten free penne substitution in pastas."}
{"text":"Visiting from Alaska. Used Yelp to find our way. The four of us had fantastic meals from pasta ragitoni with gluten-free pasta, vegetable soup and salad, spicy pork tacos a and fantastic selection of beers to pair the meals with. This is a must try, reasonably priced and our service was outstanding."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS BISTRO...... Happy hour is phenomenal  Food is delicious Staff is exceptional  Ambiance works. Especially the bar atmosphere This is my NEW FAVORITE PLACE!!!!"}
{"text":"We had a fabulous meal here and, yes, pears were found in many items from my Moscow Mule, salad and grilled cheese. It was a delight to sit out on the patio as the sun was setting and the spray was on. Just wish we had found this place earlier in our trip instead of our last night in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Really pricy spent $45 for lunch no drinks. I think the food is good here and I like to support my local establishments but I can't afford lunches like this very often."}
{"text":"The restaurant is cute with a trendy decor. The waiter took a long time to take the order, so I had to go ask the hostess to get him.  I ordered the quinoa bowl and it was pretty bland and the squash undercooked and the avocado was not ripe.  My mom ordered a sandwich and sweet potato fries . The sandwich looked pretty good and the fries were good.  The waiter took my meal off the bill and gave us a $5 coupon for the next visit.  I am going to give them another chance and try one of their gourmet grilled cheese sandwiches as that looks like that is their speciality."}
{"text":"Went there with friends. Everyone felt the salads were very good. Two of us ordered the green tea but didn't like it. They promptly replaced it with another flavor. I had the Perfect Pear salad. I think it was supposed to have pears but when I was nearly finished I realized I hadn't run across any Pear. Maybe they forgot. It was very good."}
{"text":"I love the yummy food and just up the street from were I live everyone is so friendly and very kind"}
{"text":"Me my wife and seven-year-old son enjoy this restaurant. They have good food, great service and good options for kids all at very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Walked in to enjoy a nice relaxing lunch with a friend at 11:15am today. Only to be greeted by a unfriendly hostess with mostly empty tables on the patio. When we requested patio seating she offered us the one table in the direct sunlight. She was clearly annoyed with our request for a shadier table and told us \"Well, pick whatever seat you want!\"  Dishing up plenty of sass and attitude before we ever sit down is not a great way to welcome guests. She tossed the menus down on the table and yelled over her shoulder to another server \"I don't have a server for this table pick whoever you want to serve them.\"   We left before we would be anymore of an inconvenience."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch (2 adults & 2 kids). Great location, delicious variety of dining options and large portions. Friendly and speedy service. Looking forward to visiting again."}
{"text":"Cute cafe. We sat outside and patio had misters kept us cool. Had 1/2 pasta and 1/2 salad. Very tasty. My friend had full pasta and he enjoyed it. We had a great waitress and she was attentive and encouraged the peach pear cobbler which we shared. Would definitely go back"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Have no complaints about any of the 10 different things we tried.  Went there for my birthday. Great beer selection!  Pretty good service. Not perfect. But not bad. It was pretty empty in there, so really no excuse.  No military discounts."}
{"text":"Ok... my first visit here didn't go well but that seemed to be an anomaly.  Being a glutton for punishment (plus bored and hungry) I gave it another shot (and then a few more). Well... I'm glad that I did. The service was much better and the food was excellent. By excellent I mean that every meal I've had here was delicious and I would gladly order any of them them again.  It's genuinely good food and reasonably priced. The flavors are nicely balanced and if you like lighter, healthy fare then this is the place for you. The patio also has a nice ambiance to it.  Definitely worth a shot if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Wanted to love this place. We had the Cobb salad and veggie quinoa bowl. The salad was very good. We subbed out for goat cheese, which was a great decision. The quinoa bowl would have been great except for 2 major issues: there was SOOO much sauce and way too many kalamata olives. I am not exaggerating by saying there must have been at least 20 olives in the single bowl. If I go back I would make sure to say leave off most of the sauce and olives."}
{"text":"Cute place, can work for either a low key date night or a casual lunch. Love the salad/pasta combo option!"}
{"text":"Incredibly interesting menu items! Their pear bread they use for the grilled cheese it really good, and their salads are also well balanced and delicious. Generous portion sizes. Service was a bit slow, but I'm not knocking points because I think they were a bit short-staffed that night and because our waitress was incredibly accommodating: she even had a salad remade for me when I forgot to ask for some things left off. Really trendy and cute location, outdoor seating area is nice, shaded, and has misters."}
{"text":"Happy hour is good.  They gave Tapas which is good.  The Brie, Bacon and bread Tapes is a must have.  Service was great.  Everything came out fast and server was on top of everything."}
{"text":"Great salads and flatbread pizza. Happy hour from 11-6. Lunch was beautiful and so affordable. A must try!"}
{"text":"Good light healthy fare  I had the marble ruben  Marble rye bread pulled pork, cheese, and pickles.   I would have preferred more meat but i think they are trying to keep the sandwiches light and fresh.  The sweet potato fries where the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"Amazing food. With a diverse and flavorful menu, this restaurant has something for everyone and is priced affordably for healthier options. I got the hummus nachos to start and they were excellent as well as the New Harvest sandwich was very tasty. I highly recommend and cant wait to come back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is delicious and service is always great. I recommend any of the pasta dishes."}
{"text":"Delicious! Amazing salad and completely satisfying gooey, deliciousness in the grilled cheese! Can't wait to come back to AZ just to come here!"}
{"text":"Not sure why but we expected better from this place. It was our first meal on our AZ trip and it was disappointing. The staff was very unfriendly and impatient with us especially when taking our orders. There were a lot of options on the menu but no one in our party was particularly happy with the food. The pasta was average and needed more flavor. The place itself was cute but that was pretty much it."}
{"text":"Dined in and had food to-go at least 6 times and each time has been amazing! My girlfriend and I regularly get the tacos (Carnitas and Pacos Pear), which are loaded with meat and veggies.  If this place just had a better whiskey and Tequila selection, it'd be my regular spot for dine-in."}
{"text":"The service was fast and friendly. The food was fresh and delicious. And the price was right. This is a great new neighborhood restaurant. Happy hour craft beers for $3.50. I will be back often I'm sure.!"}
{"text":"Really tasty local bistro with lots of healthy options! I got the Fall Leaves salad as I love roasted butternut squash and beets. My friend got a Berry Avocado quinoa bowl with chicken added. Huge portions, fresh and delicious. We got there at 11:15am on a Friday afternoon and 15 minutes later the place was packed. Next time I visit, would like to try out one of the grilled cheese sandwiches and some french fries."}
{"text":"My 18 month old daughter and I ate lunch here today. The service was fantastic and the food was just as good. We sat on patio- the ambiance was great- my daughter loved the music. We'll be here often."}
{"text":"Loved this place. I take my car to the dealership over there and whenever I do, I make sure to have lunch there. Great food and great wine. ;)"}
{"text":"We love this place, we usually eat here at least a couple times a month. Their food tastes fresh, full of flavor and you feel healthy with the veggies they put in most of their dishes."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I stopped in here because of the positive yelp reviews and the Perfect Pear did not disappoint.  We all had grilled cheese sandwiches and soup which was the perfect comfort food.  Cozy little place with a nice patio.  Would definitely go back the next time I am in Tempe."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to get to Perfect Pear! It was lunch time, so as usually pretty busy. Took a few minutes to have the hostess greet us and then ask if we wanted to sit at the bar, since there were no tables, so we sat at the bar.  We were asked for our drinks right away and got then really quick. Our order was taken and food came out in a timely manner. I got the southwest philly with the seasonal side. It wasn't bad, it had great flavor, meat was cooked perfectly and the sauce was great!   My only issue was that it seemed disorganized. The person that took our drink order, was not the same as the person who took our food order, and then we had someone else ask if we wanted our check and brought it out. Everyone seemed to be working in so many different stations and not on particular ones. The restaurant needs to do get a little more organized to be more efficient.   Overall, a nice first visit."}
{"text":"Such a great little place! I went here a few days ago for dinner and it was amazing. The food is great, the staff is great, and the overall restaurants is awesome. I found their menu to be quite great in regards to the amount of items to choose from. I highly recommend going here for a nice date. It's definitely worth it."}
{"text":"i always pass this place and have been meaning to try it. Their menu looks so good, I was torn between a lot of choices. i finally settled on the perfectly grilled cheese- brie, four cheese blend, arugula, bacon on spiced pear bread. I love the sweetness of the bread, which is reminiscent of cinnamon raisin toast, it compliments the saltiness of the bacon and the bold flavor of brie. I also got the seasonal side which was broccoli tossed with red onions and cranberries in a sweet vinaigrette. The broccoli was crisp and refreshing but the vinaigrette made it a little too sweet for my taste. My boyfriend got the Chicken Marsala sandwich which was huge with delicious sweet potato fries.   I love the fact that their happy hour drinks starts at 11am and goes to 6pm, but its only about fifty cents off regular price. I will definitely be back to try some of their happy hour tapas (2pm-6pm) and pear blossom salad and green chili mac that I was eyeing last time."}
{"text":"We stopped here by happenstance on the way home from the airport, because I was starving and traffic was just not moving.  They have a tranquil patio that is also dog friendly.  I fully enjoyed the mushroom grilled cheese and a giant \"side-salad\".   For my dog, I requested a grilled chicken breast. It has been the best $3.99 that I've spent in a long time. He wolfed it down so quickly that I only got a picture of him and an empty plate!  As there were many other dishes on the menu that I would have liked to try, I'll just have to visit again."}
{"text":"Tempe's best kept secret! Stopped in for lunch on a Monday with a few friends. Brian was our server and he was awesome! His attentiveness to detail and friendliness will most definitely keep us coming back for more. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"This place just opened up next door to where I live to my husband and I had to visit and give it a go. We sat in the outdoor patio area which was super cozy, intimate and calming. Really cute string lights that hang over you as you enjoy a glass of wine while a great play list of music plays in the background. The food is great, good portions and quality, yummy selections. You cant go wrong. We didn't like one of the beers and the staff was nice enough to let us switch it out for something else. Very friendly, helpful staff. Love this place and we will be sure to return!"}
{"text":"Menu is very unique and diverse with seasonal touches. I came here with a friend for dinner and ordered the Roasted sprout salad over the house blend lettuce with salmon. It fell a little short of expectation.. but definitely willing to come again, maybe for lunch, and try something different. I would definitely recommend this restaurant as a lunch spot but not for dinner."}
{"text":"I've been there several times and the quality of the  food is like an elevator up and down I know the high school kids are trying real hard to cook the food right but I am done with this place in the foothills of Ahwatukee  sorry"}
{"text":"What an amazing restaurant. Great food! Not to mention the owners and staff are so friendly. Its the perfect little gem for the Ahwatukee Foothills."}
{"text":"I've had extremely good salads here. The salad dressings were especially great. I love the atmosphere and the shaded patio seating. The servers are friendly, too."}
{"text":"Great food and their happy hour is a good deal as well. Have come a few times and the food has always left me full and satisfied"}
{"text":"Oh my lord! Found this place on Yelp because I was in the Tempe area for a meeting. I ordered the quad city melt, with perfectly cooked roast beef, sautéed mushrooms, cheese, and a spicy chipotle mayo. The combinations of flavors were so damn good, I had to stop myself from overeating! I got the sweet potato fries as a side and they were cooked perfectly! Crispy, not too salty, and honestly the best I've had ever. Can't wait to come back and try their other sandwiches and salads! Great beers on tap and wine too. A++. Service was good, the only minuscule thing I could suggest would be to play some music other than what they were playing. But, it is just down the street from a college campus, so maybe I'm alone in this. The patio is gorgeous and interior decor is very inviting. Change up the music!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place!! Many different options for sandwiches, pasta and salads, all very tasty!! The possibility of making a perfect \"pear\" by combining them is great ! Staff is very friendly, service efficient, and prices are compatible with quality !"}
{"text":"Okay so I love this place- the food is always great and our server Bryan was the best! BUT- I was here today and as soon as we walked in the host looked annoyed, and then we asked to sit inside and she said she didn't have anything inside available even though there were plenty of empty tables inside, and when she seated us outside she brought us to a table in the sun (its 95 degrees out) and I asked if we could sit in the shade and she was like \"okay well is going to really mess up my rotation\" and was super rude about it."}
{"text":"One of the easiest lunch options when your trying to appeal to all your friends \"selective\" eating habits. One thing we have in common is photography but when it comes to food we are all on opposite sides of the spectrum. This time I was on deck to pick the lunch location, hence Perfect Pear.  Veggie lovers at the table were happy with the field of greens salad options while I went for the BLT and some sweat potato fries. With the salads you can add shrimp, salmon or chicken depending on your taste for a little more. Keep in mind if you order the fries... get some extra ones as your friends will snack on yours leaving you wanting more.    Sandwich was just the right size and fries were good. I don't like going back to work \"stuffed\" and prefer to be satisfied. No one went with the Grilled cheese options to my surprise and the only downside was that salad's with the house blend seem to have way too much spinach and not the right balance of baby kale & arugula."}
{"text":"This elegant cafe is inviting to adults and children. The food is well proportioned and filled with flavor. The menu options are plentiful without being overwhelming. AND, there are options for food allergies or sensitivities! The service is friendly and intuitive. It was a very enjoyable experience all around!"}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place until twice in one week so I figured I've gotta try it.   My friend and I met for happy hour and were immediately seated on their cute patio. The red sangria was amazing. Also, do yourself a favor and order the jalapeno & bacon grilled cheese. You know you want to. It's worth it. You earned it.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Very cool little cafe with lots of fresh dishes to choose from !!  I had Spicy Cobb Salad w chicken & Squash !!"}
{"text":"Staff was super friendly, food was amazing, and 2 person lunch with appetizer was approx only $35... This ain't no boring Applebee's lunch! We had a view of a small melon garden out front that made for good conversation too!"}
{"text":"I want to like it as it is the only place out in the Foothills, service was great, food was mediocre at best, compared to other places you get much more and better quality."}
{"text":"In from out of town, wanted a non chain, great food, well prepared, fresh. I will come back.  Wine selection was a bit limited."}
{"text":"Creative menu of good bar food in a pub style restaurant with smart decor, very friendly servers and great bartenders!  Stopped in here for a business lunch being located close to Tempe, AZ.  Great atmosphere here, lots of fun, great bar with very friendly bartenders. It's a lively place, and a nice place to meet someone for a meal.  We sat at the bar, ordered some nice beers, and ordered our lunch. I had the Carnitas Tacos with pulled pork. Not as good as it looked, mostly ordinary and a little dry. But I was in the mood for pulled pork and it went down good.  My business friend got the marble Cuban sandwich with roasted pulled pork, mustard and cheese. He said it was good but nothing over-the-top.  But the atmosphere here and the friendly servers make up for the average food. A recommended stop if you're looking for a lively place with good beer on tap and good pub food."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been coming to the Perfect Pear Bistro since they opened and we will continue to come back!  The GREEN CHILI MAC is my favorite (add chicken to make it even better)!  The PERFECTLY GRILLED CHEESE sounds a little weird but the spiced pear beard is awesome with all the different types of cheese!"}
{"text":"Had another excellent lunch. Even my picky husband could find some delicious goodness. Great service and yummy food, definitely a place to visit again."}
{"text":"Love pears.  Love what they do with them!   Creative Pearing!  I had the peary-good quesidia with shrimp instead of bacon.  Hubby had the Pear, Roots & Stems Salad, add shrimp.  Both delicious.  We love everything we've ever had there.  Great variety to choose from.  Service is terrific and friendly.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I'm in love with this little place!  I would eat more salads if they all tasted this good. And they're bigger than big. The pear cobb salad is my salad of choice- check out the huge real bacon \"bits\" in my photo!  Small family bistro with friendly friendly staff- and who doesn't love a small family shop??!!  The owner, Chris, always says hi and cares.   Eat here & feel good!  PS.... Their grilled cheese is fantastic."}
{"text":"checked out the happy hour and awesome selection! 5$ wines 3$ beer and appetizers. I ordered a salad (forgot the name) but it was a big portion! Bacon in every bite. Refills right away. Could watch the sunset from our table. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"The service was great. The staff were very friendly. I really enjoyed my meal. I had a sandwich called the Quad Cities melt--steak, onions, mushrooms and cheese on marble rye. It was good. Then I went to the bathroom. It was filthy. Disgusting, even. I've been in Amtrak stations with cleaner bathrooms. I think Filiberto's bathrooms are way cleaner. It would have been less gross were they to just put out an old stock pot and a mildewy rag on the middle of the kitchen. Caveat mictor."}
{"text":"Very good lunch at reasonable prices.  Visiting from Chicago and had a salad and soup. Very unique, fresh and appears homemade. Not leaving hungry. May have to come back again before we leave town."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic! They had a great gluten free menu! It took me forever to decide what to eat because everything looked delicious! They have it so you could do a half salad/pasta option or a soup! The half portions were huge! I enjoyed a half gluten free butternut squash pasta dish and mushroom and Brie soup! Delicious! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I must go again! This is now my new favorite restaurant! The menu looked so good, I wanted it all! We shared the grilled cheese and asparagus sandwich with sweet potato fries.   I loved it! The Paloma was the best one I have ever had! The strawberry fields salad was delish! Excellent service! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Been here several times and never had an entree that I didn't enjoy! My favs include the quesadilla and the salads with shrimp and avocado. Green tea is also excellent. Yum!"}
{"text":"I had the most amazing roasted sprout wrap!  So refreshing and delicious with chicken. Loved all the food options on the menu. So excited to come back and try more."}
{"text":"We traveled a group of female athletes to Tempe for a week of practice to escape the snow and prep for spring season.    I called and set up a reservation for a group of 34 in advance on NYE.  The manager and staff were all very accommodating, friendly and were prepared when we arrived.  The menu has TONS of options- healthy with good protein and carb options.  We received our food in a timely manner and I was very pleased that our bill was reasonable for 34 people!  Loved it and plan to return next year with the same group."}
{"text":"They have an amazing menu, it was very hard to decide what eat! Everything looked good. I ended up with the mushroom melt and a bowl of shrimp and corn chowder. It was a bit cold inside, I was already wearing a cardigan, and our server was wearing a more heavy sweater. She gave us good service and kept checking in on us. We were there at 11:30a on a Sat and it was perfect timing before the lunch crowd came in (we were the only ones there for a bit) the food around us looked good too, a hummus plate, and the salads!!! The patio is super cute but it was way to cold lol"}
{"text":"Amazing place, all the pasta and sandwiches come with a gluten-free option, and the gluten-free bread is delicious and has great flavor and texture. All healthy ingredients that you can eat and feel good about it. Totally gourmet creations to try on the menu. Even the kids' meals are made from scratch. Excellent atmosphere and patio dining with misters."}
{"text":"Nice establishment with great patio seating and friendly staff. I would rate the food a 3.5/5, but the dining experience is why I give it a 4/5. Good looking menu but maybe a tad too many options. We got the Brussels sprouts salad and the BLT with iced green teas, the salad was good but nothing amazing and the BLT was ok, we weren't fans of the bread of the type of bacon they use. Sweet potato fries are delicious! The iced green tea was so nice and they even give you a cup to go, which was a great touch. Would go again to try more."}
{"text":"Found this gem through yelp reviews.  Cute bistro located in strip mall.  Service was very friendly.  But it did take a bit of time to get our food.    What we ordered  House guac served with chips and cucumber.  Nice and fresh.   Grilled cheese with jalapeño bacon and spinach dip.  Creamy rich decadent.  Not for the faint of heart   Chicken club.  So yummy. Bread was perfectly crisp and juicy chicken.    Rigatoni and tomato sauce.  Fresh sauce with garlic and basil.  Delicious.   Sweet potato fries were on point."}
{"text":"Well. 3 1/2 stars. A nice little place. Fairly clean (bathroom was a mess...that usually bothers me). Atmosphere a bit modern...nice. Staff was friendly.  Service good. Started with an appetizer off the happy hour menu. Brie and bacon and a fruit with toasted bread. Portion small. Brie baked to almost a rock. However is was tasty.   Had PACO'S PEAR TACOS roasted chicken, crispy bacon, cheddar cheese, avocado, southwest cream sauce & sprouts... topped with our spicy pear pico. The taco was nestled in two corn tortillas. Yes a double dose of tortilla per taco. Lots of tortilla. At least it was a good tortilla. Two smallish tacos. But not bad. Priced around $7.99. Overall flavor not bad. Was not spicy.  I really have no complaints. The value was good. I just was not overwhelmed."}
{"text":"We were really excited to try a new local place in Ahwatukee.  When I mentioned where we were going I heard great things and so so things about the Perfect Pear Bistro.  Our experience was much like Yelp, a few good things with some not so great things.  Rating experience on Feb. 14th.  We made a reservation for valentines evening to sit outside, they only had early times available.  We were excited to sit outside with the beautiful weather but, when we arrived there were no tables available.  We started with a happy hour drink inside, the prices were reasonable.  We finally got a table outside and started with a Brie appetizer, it tasted good but, the portion was tiny, I let my husband have it.  I don't eat a lot of pasta and I was excited to ordered the Roasted Garlic Alfredo linguini.  Unfortunately I was very disappointed in how bland it tasted, I tasted no flavor nor garlic.  My husband knew I was disappointed and asked them if I could change and get the same thing he had, they were very accommodating.  My husband had ordered the Amatricana cavatappi, a pasta with bacon sautéed with red onion, tomato, basil and Romano cheese.  We both liked the dish but, unfortunately we both had bad stomach aches and were sick later that evening.  We had a nice waitress and they did try."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant twice now for lunch and both experiences were the same.  The food is good.  We really like the different grilled cheese sandwiches.  The restaurant itself is cute and inviting.  The bad part is definitely the extremely slow service.  Both times there has been 1 server and 1 hostess/busser.  Most all the tables are full and that's the staff.  You have to hunt someone down for drink refills and your check.  If you are in a hurry, this is definitely not the place to go.  Good food....bad service.  Hey management...get some more help!"}
{"text":"I came here during my lunch break to get some time for my thoughts. I came at 11, just before the lunch crowd and promptly ordered one of their grilled cheeses with pear bread, which was actually pretty good. The pear and the brie almost made it bland, and I wish there was something a little bit salty to counter the brie, maybe a prosciutto, but I still enjoyed eating it. I also had the sweet potato fries, and I disliked them- a lot. There was no sweetness to the fries, and they almost tasted like a potato chip. They were so perplexing to eat that I had to asked my waitress what it was seasoned with, and she asked the chef who said it was just pepper. You can do what you will with that information, but that is the first and last time I will taste pepper on my sweet potato fries. I'd stick to another side and the grilled cheese if you eat here."}
{"text":"I can't say there is much to recommend this place except that they offer a choice of kale or no kale in their salad mix. Seriously, the food is bleh and the ambiance, which could be good given the setting, is unappealing. The service was okay, but not a place I'd bother to return to."}
{"text":"In town on business and saw this place several times and decided to give it a whirl. It was a great choice - terrific food and service all around. It has a quaint atmosphere, even when fairly busy at lunch, and it really captures a nice bistro mindset. My lunch was delicious - I got the 1/2 Green Chili Mac & Cheese, which was dark and hearty with a slight kick, and the 1/2 Baja Lime Salad. The lime vinaigrette was perfect - now I have to figure out how to replicate the recipe. The beer list was small but had a nice selection of craft beers and the prices were very reasonable - $5for a pint of Left Hand Milk Stout Nitro?!? Works for me! All in all, it's a great option for lunch, but not sure about dinner since it's so small. A+ for the lack of noise too - the ambience was great at lunch time, which is rare these days. I'd love to see more places move towards this format - smaller menu, reasonable portions and a very fair price. I'll be back next time I'm in town , that's for sure."}
{"text":"My family and I came to Goodyear for a spring training game and stayed in chandler due to high priced hotel rooms. My wife is gluten free and felt like Italian so I used Yelp and Perfect Pear appeared. We were overwhelmed with the unique options on the menu for \"regular people \" and gluten frees. My wife loved the butternut squash tacos and the peach cobbler was delicious. The service was exceptional and the atmosphere was a mix between new wave and contemporary."}
{"text":"Loved it. 2nd time here. Super consisten and the food is top quality. This is not a \"fancy\" restaurant but great auality foods and some pride of ownership."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! We got two grilled cheeses, pasta, and a yummy spinach dip. However, the server we had was rude and seemed super bothered every time she came to the table. Mind you there were only 3 other tables in the whole place, so it wasn't busy. In the future I'd order takeout so I don't have a server who rolls her eyes at us every time she comes to the table and makes you feel like a huge bother."}
{"text":"Great find. We came because of Yelp and the food was terrific.  Friendly, wonderful service"}
{"text":"Why didn't we come sooner!  Great service (Chris) and the food was totally awesome!  The butternut tacos are unreal."}
{"text":"We've wanted to try this restaurant for awhile....considering it is relatively close to our home down the street.   First impressions were hit and miss. The restaurant entrance leaves much to be desired. There was no waiting area and a table located adjacent to the double doors. The lighting and decor were perfect in certain areas of the restaurant. Outside seating on the patio was available but we chose a table inside near the restrooms.   The service.... Was above average and did not feel pressured during the ordering process and our server and was knowledgeable about the wine and food menus. What appeared to be the manager/owner was unimpressive with an untucked shirt and upon asking for salt and pepper (not on the table) we were provided with McCormick's store-bought grinders. This felt like eating at home. The silverware was wrapped with paper napkins a la Denny's diner style. They could have provided cloth napkins as a nice touch of class.   The food:  Appetizer....We ordered the bruschetta that we ordered was the \"signature\" and the \"philly goat.\" The bread was not the typical bruschetta crusty hard bread that we are used to. It seemed a little undergrilled. The caramelized onions and mushrooms were well prepared on the \"philly goat\" with slightly too much cheese. The \"signature\" was very fresh and tasty but the bread was a little soggy.  Salad....We ordered the \"Strawberry Fields\" salad which was fresh and light. However, it would have been nice to have a decanter of salad dressing on the side because people have preferences regarding how much salad dressing each individual may want on their salad.   Entree.....The AMATRICIANA, a la macaroni tomato mixture was unimpressive, lacking salt, pepper, or imagination. We did not order it with any chicken or salmon but seriously doubt that it would have improved the flavor of this lackluster dish. Did I mention asking for pepper???  Wine....Arizona Stronghold was the wine of choice and was a welcome sight. The restaurant also has a great selection of craft beers to compliment the menu.   Endnotes...... The music playing was at the appropriate decibel level and genre. Great songs by the Police and others. However, hearing Sheryl Crow blare \"If it makes you happy.........\" was a little too supermarket for us. It would be nice to hear more eclectic in a restaurant such as this one. We hope that this restaurant does not receive this review in poor light as they have a lot going for them and so much potential. Please take the recommendations as pure advice only. We want to come back at some point in time but want improvements or we won't visit a third time.  Ponyrider's"}
{"text":"Food is amazing here and staff is super helpful. The service is bit slow. If you are in a rush, take out is the best idea."}
{"text":"I love this cafe! I'm a faithful servant to the Perfectly Grilled Cheese. This place should win some serious awards. And don't be scared off by the fact that it is a sit down restaurant, your food will be ready in literally 10 minutes. Everything here is cooked to perfection and the service is good too. Definitely stop here for lunch and have a sandwich, I won't even be offended that it's not the grilled cheese...everything is good here! P.S. The sweet potato fries are bomb too!!"}
{"text":"Charming patio and the perfect spot to please everyone. Meat eaters can add protein to bowls, salads, and pasta. Vegetarians can leave the food as is.  I had the lemon linguini with asparagus, tomatoes, and broccoli - added salmon. I did the combo, so also added the Sprouts salad with roasted Brussels sprouts, pepitas, feta, and pesto vinaigrette. Paired with happy hour La Playa Sauvignon Blanc, it was perfect.  Friendly and attentive service. Reasonable prices for quality food with fresh ingredients and some fun, trendy twists.  Great spot for post-theatre at Gammage - they offer a discount with your same-day ticket stub.  I'll definitely be back when I'm in Tempe."}
{"text":"I'm giving more stars than I want to because the venue is cute. My friend had reserved a table for about eight the day before, but when our party arrived, there were a lot of confused looks from the waitresses, basically saying, \"What reservation?\" It took a lot longer for this situation to be remedied as well because one waitress would look to another waitress to handle the situation. We were also forced to sit outside, and it's not exactly the best time of year to be having a meal outside.   Finally, they pushed some tables together. I ordered the Jalapeno grilled cheese with sweet potato fries [~10], which was spicier than I thought it would be. The sweet potato fries were quite good! My friend's grilled cheese came out cold, but it took nearly forever to track down a server. They just wouldn't come to check up on us for the longest time.   Even though Perfect Pear had made a mistake, we weren't compensated in any way. Service was disorganized, rude, and inefficient.   The venue isn't ideal for large groups either. The tables are two-seaters and some are pushed together to seat four people.   I was actually really disappointed in my experience today because I quite liked the Ahwatukee location."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend on Monday evening. It was around 6pm, but it wasn't too packed so we were able to get a seat pretty easily.  I liked how it wasn't noisy - I was able to hear my friend without having to speak above my normal voice. Our server was friendly and checked up on us a couple times but not annoyingly often.   We ordered the pear salsa and chips. This was okay. I didn't taste any pear or see pear and the chips were just regular chips you get at a grocery store. It was pretty spicy though, so I would be careful ordering this if you can't handle spicy foods.  I ordered the Perfectly Grilled Cheese [$9] with the tomato basil soup instead of the fries because I like dipping grilled cheese into tomato soup. I thought the sandwich was great, really yummy. The portion was perfect for me too. The bread i"}
{"text":"Good service and food was okay, but a surprisingly limited menu.  Website promotes itself as American comfort food, but that is not the case."}
{"text":"Great food and service! I am so excited so have a great locally owned restaurant in Ahwatukee"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and thought I 'd give it a try after reading all the good reviews.  I showed up on a Saturday night at 8ish and saw the place was mostly empty.  Service was quick and friendly.  I got the chicken pesto sandwich with a side salad.  The side salad was actually pretty large but it cost an extra $3 over the fries.  The chicken sandwich was really good.  The place is a little hipster for my liking but the food is good...I guess I should expect that for a restaurant near a college campus.  I'd probably eat here again."}
{"text":"I was visiting my sister in AZ and got lunch to go.  It was delicious!!!  Bacon and asparagus grilled cheese and the taco's."}
{"text":"The food is creative and flavorful at The Perfect Pear. There is a variety of menu items to choose from. They have sandwiches, salads, soup, pasta, pita flat bread. Plus they have tacos.  I tried Paco's Pear Tacos.  They had roasted chicken, crispy bacon, chedder cheese, avocado, southwest cream sauce, sprouts and topped with their spicy pear pico de gallo. The were good but , I would have liked if they came with a small side of something to pick from.  I thought certain menu choices were a bit expensive considering the portion size and amount of food.  In any case, they have a bar with a long happy hour; especially if you might like to day drink.  It is a cute place to grab a quick bite."}
{"text":"Yummy! I got the Baja Lime salad and have heard great things about their tacos. I will definitely be back to try something different. They also have GF bread and pasta options to substitute!"}
{"text":"Great place to meet a group of great friends and relax. We shared dishes and were able to taste test most of the menu. It was all fantastic! The owner and staff were very generous and kind to indulge us as a big group."}
{"text":"Eating here as a single person is like having a contagious disease. Other tables were told specials. No one asked about dessert. I am now giung to add to bad stereo types by tipping, for me, very ungenerously. I believe in tipping well. The food was ok, but i have to say that i thought the bacon in my taco was a foreign object like a shard of steel. Disappointing."}
{"text":"I love one of their \"Signature Grilled Cheese\" sandwiches, Bacon and Jalapeno, it is so good.  The soups are always good as well.  Try their Pear Martini."}
{"text":"I have not had a bad experience at this amazing restaurant! I must give it only 4 stars tho because on a couple occasions the service was slow... Not terrible but very slow. I love seeing the owner in there every time I go in and he is so hands on working every part of that place."}
{"text":"What a cute little place.  I had a wonderful lunch here.  Prices are average and the waitresses were  great.  Can't wait to visit AZ again to go back."}
{"text":"We split an outstanding pear and salmon salad. The dressing was light. I also had the tomoto basil soup. Fresh taste with chunks of tomato. Cute atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in town. The half and half combos are fantastic, every single salad and pasta I've tried has been awesome.   I've brought multiple friends and even my boss here, and everyone gives the food and ambiance their approval. The wait staff is very sweet as well!   Happy hour is great, standard prices are really good for the amount of food you get... I have no complaints"}
{"text":"Love everything about this place.  The food, service and atmosphere and are all perfect.  Do not forget to try the pear cobbler as it is the best thing ever!!"}
{"text":"Wow.  It's really been a while since I rushed home to write a review.  I met Sarah H and Dan H here tonight for happy hour.  They just opened on Monday and we were excited something new had opened in the Foothills and we wanted to support them.  Well, first off we met here for happy hour but the only happy hour specials they had was on beer and wine.  Not nearly as happy as we were hoping.  We ordered some drinks, I had a nice Sauvignon Blanc, and looked over the menu.  Nothing on the menu is very inspired or unique but I finally settled on a Mexican salad with black beans and chipotle ranch.  Something cool and crunchy and spicy sounded just right.  Dan ordered a Tuscan meat and cheese platter and Sarah wasn't really hungry so she just got the chili cheese dip which I was looking forward to trying anyway.    We chatted while we were waiting for our food but the place is so loud, it wasn't easy and they had the most god awful music on.  Not quite loud enough you could understand it, but loud enough that it made it difficult to chat.  We thought we heard country music but couldn't be sure.  They definitely need to play something more café-ish to set the ambiance of a good meal with friends rather than being at a rodeo.  Sarah's chili cheese dip came out first and we dug in.  It reminded us a lot of that Velveeta dip you make with a can of Rotel, only not as good.  And they didn't give you much either.  We ate it nonetheless because it's cheese, but I don't think we'll be ordering it again.  Dan's meat and cheese plate looked fine but my salad wasn't quite what I expected.  When I ordered it the waitress asked if I wanted Spring Mix for my lettuce or a green lettuce mix.  While I normally go for the darker greens, I thought a green lettuce mix would be best to stand up to a heavy ranch dressing.  What I got was a mix of spinach and arugula, predominately spinach, which couldn't stand up to the creamy dressing and was a soppy mess.  I ate it, but I can't say I would ever order it again.  Any salad here for that matter as the dressing was put on with such a heavy hand, it made what is normally a light meal, heavy and greasy.    We paid and were on our way in under an hour.  It was too noisy and not really conducive to a long leisurely evening of chatting, drinking and eating.  Maybe if they change their menu a bit and I give them some time to work out the kinks, I may try it again, but I'm sure."}
{"text":"Great restaurant!  Atmosphere was so nice - we sat outside on the patio and it was perfect.  I think they had almost too many choices of food - it was hard to decide so we ordered several items and shared.  The Tomato soup was the best I've (ever?) had.   Mac and Cheese - terrific.  Grilled Cheese - great but I didn't like the bread so I would choose another bread if possible.  My daughter loved it.  Overall we thought this was a fun place with great food and we definitely will be back to try other items."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. We ordered the cauliflower spinach dip which was a superb start to our meal. I got the mushroom melt which had an exquisite array of tastes to it. My friend got the Mediterranean Mac n cheese and the coconut curry soup which was lit.    The atmosphere was perfect as well. The lighting was great, the music was on point and not too loud, and the servers were great.   This was my second time here and will definitely be back at some point."}
{"text":"During our visit to Phoenix, we needed to find a great vegan meal to go. The staff was really friendly and knowledgable about their menu. The Wild Chop Salad and Baja Lime without the cheeses were loved by all - even me as a meat eater. Wish we had a restaurant like this in Orange County."}
{"text":"First time for dinner .   The food was good and prices were reasonable...  Additionally the service was good and always checked on the table ."}
{"text":"My new favorite, local hangout!  Signature flatbread is incredible and pairs nicely with a glass of wine.  Would have been 5-stars except for the flies & ants on the patio."}
{"text":"Jumping on the band wagon to say \"freaking bomb.\" Everything we had was great. Started off with the watermelon tea, buffalo cauliflower (thanks helpers for the recommendation) and a Mother Earth Cali Creamin. Boyfriends favorite beer, haven't seen it since we left San Diego. He was pumped. And it was on draft. High Marks across the board to start.   Had the Baja lime salad, filling, great texture variety, super tasty dressing, just wish I had remembers to request dressing on the side.  Also had the perfect grilled cheese. Pear bread? Fantastic. Sweet potato fries? Crispy and delicious.  Sandwich? Perfectly cooked with little bits of Brie scattered in the sandwich. So good. And finally the French bistro sandwich (I think). Chicken,pear, arugula, soft baguette, balsamic glaze. I'm getting hungry again.   Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Amazing Happy Hour! Great service..excellent food!  We had the buffalo cauliflower, Brie with bacon...so good!  Great atmosphere & great value!  We will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Amazing menu. I got the gluten free Mac & cheese and it was awesome. They Have so many great gluten free options as well!"}
{"text":"Just ok. I had the Italian Rigatoni. It was very bland. Could have used some salt but, apparently, having salt on the table is beneath them. Also, the rigatoni was supposed to have Italian sausage in it but I didn't see any."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed in this place today. The atmosphere is so adorable and inviting and it advertises it self as healthy comfort food, However being a super healthy eater this food tasted nothing close to clean. I got the quad city melt and chicken curry soup. The food was okay but just lacked that fresh healthy clean taste . It didn't taste like anything I couldn't get at some dive bar. It was very over priced for the quality 15$ for a sandwich and soup that was just okay. The sandwich was very mushy and tasted like it was dipped in salt and dressings just to make it taste appealing.  Just tasted greasy and over seasoned with crap. Our server was awesome but there were like 6 tables around us that were just filled with empty dishes and it made the experience feel dirty. I probably won't be back again and wish I could have enjoyed it more :("}
{"text":"This is a pretty chilled out relaxed place, love going there on a lazy Sunday afternoon. The food was pretty good and they have a pear ale which is absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"This is officially on the top of my list of post-theater restaurants! Service is lovely, and ambiance is pleasant. We had the carnitas tacos, which were seasoned perfectly and really tender, and the Mediterranean salad with grilled shrimp, also cooked & seasoned perfectly. The tacos were accompanied by black beans, and I couldn't stay out of them! For the salad, I chose the house green mix and I was so glad I did because the arugula made everything even better. Definitely going back!!!"}
{"text":"Trying this place again. Maybe it will be better with no testosterone wanting a steak"}
{"text":"This place is incredible! Nice atmosphere, great customer service, and delicious, healthy food. This has become one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"I have found my oasis for refueling not only  the body but my soul! The ambience was uplifting, tranquil, gorgeous! The servers and the hosts were so polite and cheerful it was a fantastic experience!  And the food! Oh my goodness  The Buffalo Chicken Tacos with cilantro cabbage and southwestern cream sauce-so great! Served with southwest black beans. A delicious combination!  The Spinach Dip should not be overlooked it's a must! The tortilla chips come out hot -perfectly salty and are amazing with the dip in a sour dough bread bowl that you will have a hard time holding yourself back from eating.  I want to come back again and again!"}
{"text":"Came here for our first time tonight and couldn't be more pleased! We ordered the mini hummus and cucumbers off the happy hour menu- super good and just enough to tide us over until our friend arrived and we ordered. For our drinks we ordered the Pear Mule, Peach Margarita and Pear Martini! Excellent!!!  For dinner we chose to all share the Hummus Nachos, the Buffalo Chicken Tacos and the Perfectly Grilled Cheese with French fries and Sweet Potato fries. Starting with the Hummus Nachos- not one bad thing to say about this! It's huge- definitely a sharing size, crisp chips, excellent fresh ingredients and delicious Hummus! The Perfectly Grilled Cheese was absolutely incredible, our favorite out of the 3! The bread we would have bought a loaf of, the cheese combination is the best!! And last but certainly not least the Buffalo Chicken Tacos! So very good! The chicken was flavorful, the slaw on top was fresh and delicious!! Overall it was an excellent experience!! We will definitely be back here!!"}
{"text":"Wow, a great place!  We had lunch on a Friday, sat at the bar.  A unique menu with a happy hour starting at 11:00 a.m.  My wife & I, both of which have a background in food service, management, & ownership, were impressed by the synergy of the restaurant crew.  The prices aren't bad and the food quality is superb.  My wife had a grilled cheese with sweet potato fries.  The fries maybe were a little over-cooked, but nothing to complain about.  I had their cobb salad and shrimp corn chowder soup.  Our only regret is there is not a Perfect Pear Bistro in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This review is just for happy hour.... the drinks here are.....not so great. The happy hour pricing is decent, but the drinks just taste like fake flavored vodkas. We tried the brie with bacon and it was tasty, but that's hard to mess up. For Mill area, Perfect Pear isn't bad, but otherwise, it isn't a place I'd go for HH."}
{"text":"I had high expectations of this place after hearing nothing but rave reviews from so many people, but really, it's just ok. I came with a group of people from work for happy hour. I ordered a stout and it came out.... frozen?!?! I don't know how this would happen, but it was like a slushy, which is not awesome for a beer. I shared the brie and the flatbread with a coworker and also tried the mac and cheese everyone raved about. The brie was just.... brie with some sugar and bacon on top... it was fine, but it didn't blow my mind. The flatbread was decent, but also nothing special. At least the items were on happy hour and only cost 8$ for both. The mac and cheese was terrible, the sauce tasted like it came from frozen or something. It also took forever to get our bills, with each one of us having to ask for our bills individually. I probably wouldn't come back here, but if you're in the foothills, this is a decent place for happy hour."}
{"text":"Delicious food and super cute atmosphere. Tons of options made it very difficult deciding what to order. Highly highly recommend."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with a few friends. I ordered a cosmopolitan to start. It wasn't too weak and wasn't too strong.   For my entree I ordered the G-ma's Mac and added chicken. This Mac and cheese dish was really good. It was nice and cheesy and it was a very big portion. I was only able to get through half of it.   They have a pretty big menu. We came on a weekday so there was no wait and the customer service was good. I'll definitely come back to try some more items."}
{"text":"Great friendly service , delicious peach margarita and unique yummy food.  Lots of cheese .  Recommend -cauliflower spinach dip, baked Brie with bacon,  roasted sprout salad and grilled goodness sandwich.  Definitely is no ordinary grilled cheese.  Next time trying pasta and cobbler for dessert ."}
{"text":"Perfect pear explains it all in its name.  A delightful menu with pears complimenting a large portion of the items. Friendly staff, bar area and large tables a few booths."}
{"text":"I give Perfect Pear a solid 4+ stars for their food.  So far I have only taken out, but enjoyed everything thoroughly.  The carnitas in the tacos were fabulous.  Way better than I expected.  Tuscan Rigatoni and Athena's Garden pastas were fantastic.  Grandma's Mac was just shy of great.  Cabo Cobb salad is awesome too.  They were really nice about putting in an order at 8:59:47 on a Friday when they close at 9.  I am not sure why they close at 9 on a Friday... I feel like if they went with late night service, they could potentially become the type of place that cooks and servers from other restaurants in Tempe/Chandler/Ahwatukee go to after their dinner shift.  The atmosphere is really nice.  I will be dining in soon, I look forward to trying many more delicious items off their menu."}
{"text":"I had a 6 hour layover in Phoenix, and wanted to get out of the airport and have a nice dinner. After reading a bunch of reviews, I ended up here. I was seated at the bar because I was solo, but the food, the ambiance, and the price were wonderful! If I lived closer, I'd certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Saw this place on PBS \"Check Please\" and also had it bookmarked so had the opportunity for a recent lunch meeting. Upscale, open and unique may best describe it. Plenty of salad, sandwich, and pasta options.  They have a bar and indoor seating. Outside is a covered patio with shade screens and a mister.  Ambient temperature was reasonable for Arizona in the summer time. Place filled up quickly  for a busy lunch crowd.  I had Paco's Pear Tacos with roasted chicken, bacon, chedder cheese, avocado, sprouts, a sauce and spicy pear pico. The two soft tacos were filling and a very good meld of flavors with a little heat. Order came with side of black beans with some pico. The green iced tea was also very good.  Did not notice any desserts, nor were we asked. Saw a pear cobbler on a Yelp photo  so not quite sure what's up. Noise level inside was a bit high but not a big distraction. Service was excellent...still wondering what happened to that pear cobbler for dessert?"}
{"text":"The girl with burgundy-ish hair is rude . Maybe it was an off day for her.. idk first time in and she was so rude . Rude looks and attitude right from the door...  Next the food is awkward. I'm not sure who eats grilled cheeses on sweet pear bread but it was disgusting and the flavors did not mix well.  Salad was good. Frys we're good.  Tacos weren't very appetizing.  The green chili cheese dip was good but honestly tastes like the kind you can buy in a jar at the grocery store."}
{"text":"Great food and great ambiance! I love this place and they have amazing Grilled cheese options! Their pastas are good too. Try and stop by for happy hour for great deals!"}
{"text":"We came here for Happy Hour and it was awesome! Really really good service, good choices, and good prices. I even loved the music selection they were playing on the overhead speakers. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went for weekday lunch. Salads are their thing. Saw many huge beautiful salads coming out of kitchen that looked tasty. I got asparagus soup-rate it as meh- it was salty and just not springy. Husband got grilled cheese which was awesome. I did wrap with chicken. Would totally go back and recommend to friends.  Beer selection good. Service timing perfect. Easily could do a work lunch and get back on time."}
{"text":"Being fairly new to the Phoenix area, I'm still in the process of figuring out the best restaurants and bars in town. It is a big gaping hole which I'm desperately seeking to fill. As part of this research, I stumbled upon Perfect Pear- rave reviews, reasonably nice looking decor, proximity to work... lot of things seemed to work in its favor. I was excited to give this place a try and scheduled a business dinner here. My associates were running a few minutes late so I decided to sit at the bar and order a drink till I waited for them to arrive. I got started with the pear mule since it came highly recommended by the bartender/waitress. The first few sips tasted pretty great and the freshness of the pear brightened up the drink, which was nice. However, the flavor of lime was a little overbearing and I wasn't as thrilled with it as I was with the first sip. My company arrived and we were promptly seated. We got started with a round of the coconut curry soup, which I think was the best thing we tasted that evening. There were some incredible flavors and they were very well balanced. We ordered the hummus nachos which kinda fell a little flat. The ratio of chips to hummus was just off. After the first few bites, we were left with a plate full of plain, over salted tortilla chips. I ordered the green chili mac and cheese with chicken for my entree since they're supposedly known for it. It certainly wasn't bad by any means but not even close to being among the best I've had before. Our waitress was delightful, which was really nice and brightened up our evening. The food on the other hand leaves a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"LOVE their gluten-free menu. I felt pampered and catered to instead of merely accommodated. Delicious, intriguing flavor/texture/ingredient pairings that really stand out from the crowd. And did I say delicious!? I've been here twice in the last couple months (I hop around a lot), and had the Fall Leaves Salad, the Wild Chop Salad and a Fall pasta offering that's not on the menu at the moment. I would go back and have any of them again, and there are 4 or 5 other menu items I can't wait to try, too! I love that they serve the hummus with veggies for gluten-free folks - it's on the menu! Friendly, cool vibe - got to go back!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times in the past, and literally everything on their menu is fantastic. We went on Saturday for dinner, and we got their signature Perfectly Grilled Cheese (brie, four cheese, arugula, bacon) with the house salad side and the Sicilian Sandwich (sirloin, red peppers, tomatoes, arugula) with their seasonal side. When we went, the side was a broccoli slaw, and I just wanted to keep eating the broccoli; it was absolutely delicious.   Their grilled cheese options make the perfect comfort food for any time of day, and they give you a nice portion of food. Same with the Sicilian Sandwich; the sirloin goes down so smoothly, the meal will be over before you know it!"}
{"text":"Loved it! Had the bacon, jalapeño grilled cheese sandwich and it was delicious.  Service wasn't great, but will definitely be back. Can't believe I work around the corner. Yay ,,"}
{"text":"Great. Surprised we hadn't heard of this place until now. Healthy clean options if you want to eat healthy and then not so healthy really delicious options too. We got the grilled cheese, green chili mac and the butternut squash salad. My favorite (probably very unhealthy), was the green chili mac. Food quality was also top notch. Service was excellent too. No complaints and we will certainly come back."}
{"text":"Tried this cute little bistro for lunch today and was very happy I did! I had a salad that was bursting with flavor! The pears and raspberries made my taste buds dance. It was a fun & friendly atmosphere, I will definitely go back. Another hidden gem, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My favorite place in the foothills by far! I've only been for lunch but the food and service has always been more than wonderful!  You definitely get more than what you pay for and the quality of everything has always been great! Absolutely love this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Good food ordered the bacon jalapeño grilled cheese, so yummy. Sweet potatoe fries and the watermelon ice tea was good. Will definitely come back.. thanks again."}
{"text":"I'm happy to see that a business seems to finally be making it in this location after so many have failed. Ahwatukee, the Foothills in particular, is in dire need of more dining options that aren't pizza or a chain.  As a rule, I avoid new restaurants until they've had a couple of months to iron out the kinks, but I'd been hearing good things about Perfect Pear for a while, so last night, my daughter and I went for dinner. I really wish that I could say that I'm excited to return, but in truth, I probably won't dine there again.  We encountered the first glitch of the evening as soon as we entered. No one was at the front to greet us, nor was there a sign indicating that we should seat ourselves. So for five minutes, we stood there by the entrance feeling a bit foolish. I passed the time by looking at the laminated menu (which gave me pause--I understand the practical aspects of lamination, but, gosh, they really evoke places like Dennys, not a restaurant that clearly is trying to be much more than that). While we waited for someone to direct us, I made eye contact with someone working in the partially open kitchen, but he just ignored us. I told the young lady who eventually seated us that it was our first visit, and that I had no idea whether or not we were supposed to seat ourselves.  I don't think she took my point.  To my relief, our server arrived almost immediately to take our drink orders. Yay!  The menu is limited to starters, salads, pasta and sandwiches, which seems perfectly in line for a bistro, and each category has good variety of offerings. On our server's recommendation, I ordered the Tukee Pear quesadilla to begin the meal.  It came out to the table fairly quickly and was really big. And delicious looking--the tortilla was perfectly crisped and puffed up and contained just the right amount of its filling of pear, bacon, arugula and pepper jack. It was so good, I even convinced my ultra-picky child to try it. The spicy dipping sauce (sour cream-based, I believe) complemented it nicely.  So our meal was off to a really good start.  For my dinner, again on the server's recommendation, I ordered the Wild Chop salad made with their baby green blend (kale, spinach, arugula) with salmon added. I should add here that I LOVE salad. In fact, it's kind of my litmus test for restaurants. I don't care how good the rest of the meal is, if the salad--even just a house side--is some depressing affair thrown together like an afterthought, then whoever is running the kitchen isn't paying attention to the details. That never bodes well.  When the salad *is* the meal, you should expect that just as much care goes into it as any other dish.  This salad landed with an absolute thud. Sadly, the two smallish pieces of salmon were so overcooked, desiccated and hard. This poor fish had been done a grave injustice. Still, I decided to give the rest of the salad a try before throwing in the towel.  I suspect that whoever made my salad doesn't much care for them. What a mess. The greens on top were dry, making me wonder if someone forgot to dress them. There also appeared to be no thought put into the composition of the dish--the greens were randomly topped with a tablespoon or two of plain quinoa, a few long pieces of soggy cucumber and roasted bell pepper, a sad lump of crumbled feta... I took a bite of the greens and couldn't taste any pesto dressing. When I dug down, though, I realized that it hadn't been left off after all--it was all just at the bottom, alas. So some of the salad was under-dressed and rest was drenched. At that point, I just put my fork down and said, \"This is pitiful.\"  Meanwhile, my daughter was pigging out on the huge side of seriously good crinkle-cut sweet potato fries that came with her (not) Perfectly Grilled Cheese, which, like my salmon, was terribly overcooked. We could both see that one side of it was pretty charred, but, hey, charred bread can still be tasty. Just not this time. I don't know if the spiced pear bread was a little stale to begin with or if it just suffered during cooking, but the sandwich was really tough and dry. None of the ooey gooey lusciousness I'd expected. My daughter had gamely eaten one half, but abandoned it for the fries. It wasn't until I tried a bite that I realized how bad the sandwich actually was. I let her open up the remaining half and eat the cheese and bacon. I ate some of the bread, anyway, because I was hungry.  To the restaurant's credit, our server handled the salad problem gracefully, apologizing and removing it from the bill. I had a bowl of okay tomato soup instead. I didn't bother complaining about the sandwich, since most of it was eaten.   I'd hoped that the Perfect Pear would become my go-to neighborhood place for dinner. But I just don't have faith that the kitchen is paying attention to everything that comes out of it. That's a shame."}
{"text":"Super fun place so close to where we live. Great menu and great staff! We have tried almost everything on the menu and we liked it all! Pasta is probably my favorite!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour.  My friends and I went for dinner on a Thursday night. Not too crowded. Amazing staff and service. And all the dishes we ordered were some of the best food I've ever had. I had the green chili Mac and cheese and it was a perfect level of green chili. My friends had the Athena pasta, the Mediterranean pasta, and the roasted butternut squash rigatoni.  All equally delicious! I will be coming back here soon and often!"}
{"text":"We were drawn by all the positive reviews to try this place while in the area. We were less than impressed. On the plus side, our waitress was attentive but not overly so, which we appreciated. Our salads (Pear Cobb and Strawberry Fields) were both delicious, as was our hummus appetizer.   However we also got some kind of cheesy chipotle bread appetizer that was pretty unappetizing. We each only took one bite and my husband declared that it tasted like something you'd get from the freezer section at Wal Mart. We sent it back.   His corn chowder was mediocre and my \"Grandma's Mac and cheese\" tasted of Velveeta. We were underwhelmed by the meal."}
{"text":"Service was great! Atmosphere feels a little like a chain cafe, but still pleasant.  The best part is the food. We had a larger party so we got a pretty diverse spread. The group I was with was also all about sharing! In the end I tried 6 different entries and a few appetizers. The stand outs were the cauliflower appetizer, and the pear mule. In the end I didn't have a single thing there that I wouldn't mind ordering again. I have gone back once after the initial visit and it was the same thing... great food. If you want something a step of from your Panera Vera equivalent you're well overdue to try the perfect pear!"}
{"text":"Favorite neighborhood restaurant back in the Foothills.  I order salads to bring home for the week. Farm to Table goodness."}
{"text":"Great date spot or any time you are craving great food in a cute location! Outdoor sitting with twinkle lights is always beautiful ! Their menu has combinations that might seem odd but NEVER disappoint! Their quinoa bowls make me so happy and all their pastas have an amazing sauce to give it so much flavor! Their sandwiches and appetizers are a hit as well!!! Can't go wrong taking anyone to this place since the menu caters to almost every need!"}
{"text":"Service was definitely slow and subpar, I went on a Friday night and waited 7or so minutes to get greeted (sat at the bar) the staff was busy cleaning up, it looked like they were trying to close up even though they were not closing for a few more hours. Besides that the menu was interesting and our food was pretty good. I can't say I'll be going back but it's definitely a place to check out even if it is just once."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food! I've been a couple of times now, with friends- and we all have been pleased with our orders. The pear mule was divine!"}
{"text":"A little pricey ( $3 extra for chicken as the protein and $5 for shrimp!). But, if you can get over that, this place is great for an hour's lunch break from work as I've tried it."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience! I totally recommend this place. The food is AMAZING and the service is great! Thank you!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed the food quality and flavors at perfect pear. Chicken tacos with bacon, Curry bowl and chicken pesto sandwich with sweet potato fries were fantastic. Very delicious, appealing to a variety of tastes in our group.  There were a couple of minuses, the main issue was noise level. Inside the acoustics of the building are not favorable to many people talking and it creates a din.  Outside on the patio, the music being played was very loud and made it difficult to hear each other, every time one of us said something, the other person said, \"what?\"  The other thing was that the quinoa was under cooked, quinoa should not be served al dente.  Next time we might order takeout."}
{"text":"The food here was amazing! It is great to have clean eating options while traveling for work. This place was awesome!  I loved the added touch of the server bringing me a cup to go of their Pear Jasmine Green Tea when she brought my credit card back.   Definitely go!"}
{"text":"What an amazing place.  Very diverse menu and the food is awesome and healthy at the same time.  Prices are great too and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"The food here is good. Drinks are better. The patio is dog friendly which is great. I've been a few times and the only thing I can say is that it is a little inconsistent! I usually order the same things and sometimes the food and the service are considerably better than other times. Overall though this is a great place for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Party of 7 without reservation, the entire Team pitches in to bring an outstanding dinner.  Salads outstanding, butternut squash soup delicious, pasta delivered flawlessly. Can't wait to visit again"}
{"text":"I have enjoyed everything I've tried. The roasted sprout is by far my favorite salad. The spinach dip was a hit among the table. Actually EVERYTHING we've had here has been amazing. I've introduced this place to a few of my people and has now become a favorite. There isn't anything on the menu that isn't great. The staff is good depending on the night. I've had a night where are server just wasn't having it even though we were basically the only table, outside of that by far my favorite joint."}
{"text":"Such a great name - Perfect Pear Bistro! Service was friendly, but scatty on an early Friday evening. No mention of Happy Hour specials and they were out of the beer we were interested in. The waiter also forgot a few things from our order and we had to remind him. The food is decent American food with some of the trendy add-ons. My salad was to be loaded with butternut squash (couldn't find it) beets (a few) bacon (stuck together) but the avocado on top - luscious!! I did enjoy the cider vinaigrette. I also asked for a piece of bread to go with the salad - it came dry, no butter included and though sweet and tasty - still dry. My friends enjoyed the 4-cheese grilled cheese sandwich but the sweet potato fries were limp, not crispy like the regular fries which were yummy. I'd like to think I may try this place again but they need to step it up to stay in competition with everything else that's out there."}
{"text":"Our friends recommended and we all went and loved it...their sweet potato fries were the best I've ever tried...my salad (Roots & Stems) was sooo good...we live in Gilbert and it's worth the drive to Ahwatukee..."}
{"text":"I love this place! It is the perfect spot for ladies who lunch. Not that I am a woman of leisure by any means but this location is not too far from my office but still just outside of the ASU bubble so if I am meeting a friend they won't have to deal with the parking or traffic issues. They have really fantastic salads so that is my go-to option. You can choose from 2 different choices of base greens and a protein but then each has it's own distinct flavor due to the additional veggies, add-ons, and housemade dressing. My favorite is the Baja Lime with house blend greens (kale and spinach) and add shrimp. They also have a fantastic unsweetened iced green tea. Everyone that I have eaten with here has loved the food. The service is always pretty good too. They also have a lovely patio that is even doable in the summer due to the fans and misters."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place for a while when my hubby and I met his nephew here a few weeks ago. I ordered their \"classic\" salad. It was a decent salad but it arrived with no dressing on it. When I pointed this out to the waitress she said that people had complained about their salads having too much dressing so they had started using less. I didn't want to be argumentative but I was pretty sure that there was absolutely no dressing on that salad. When she brought it out in a small cup she pointedly referred to it as \"the extra dressing you wanted\". We also had a hard time getting drink refills and waited a while for our orders to be taken. The food was good though. The portion sizes are larger than what you would expect for this type of place. Overall, a-ok. I'm sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"Very delicious & healthy. I came here for lunch with a group. We all had salads and sandwiches. Everything was very good and healthy. We thoroughly enjoyed our lunch and would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Great service and food. The waitress was quick to respond to our requests and the food took a reasonable amount of time to get delivered. The sweet potato fries had great spices which many other places keep bland and even the cut of fry was unique and added to the enjoyment. My wife's grilled cheese was the best she had at a restaurant.  The decor felt more like an evening hip gastro pub with the dark colors so it may be appropriate at night but felt a little out of place for a great lunch place."}
{"text":"this is my third time going here, and it was delicious!!! I ordered 1/2 a salad and 1/2 pasta, for the salad i got the strawberry fields, which is the best salad i've ever had! Then for the 1/2 pasta, I got spicy chipotle cream that had pumpkin seeds in it but it paired very well with it! i also had wonderful service I will be coming back again!"}
{"text":"The owners of Perfect Pear need to be more hands on with this location as the little details that majority of people might not notice are falling through the cracks. This location is in our neighborhood and we go weekly. The staff is friendly enough but lacking attention to detail. Fingers cupping the plate/bowls when bringing out the food, not checking back in after bringing out the meal, lack of eye contact (they seem overwhelmed), very short and without warmth with patron engagement. The food is decent as there are many choices and the servings are typically generous. Their patio is nice - great place to bring a group of friends."}
{"text":"Beautiful patio, gorgeous interior, excellent food and service. Seriously everything on this menu looks delicious. I got the perfect pear classic salad and my boyfriend got the buffalo chicken tacos. Both meals were really good! Also the watermelon black tea is like no other tea I have had. I really enjoyed it. Definitely would recommend their amazing happy hour and tapas as well!"}
{"text":"We ordered the green chile mac, the tukee pear, and the southwest philly.  The mac was quite good, the bacon some of the best ever.  And just a small amount of green chile flavored the whole dish.  The tukee pear was an exquisite quesadilla with a sweet bite of pear now and again - outstanding.  The philly was a little underwhelming, but still fine.  The server was pleasant and attentive. The atmosphere was quiet (an hour before closing) and relaxing.  This place is a keeper for us!"}
{"text":"Went to the Perfect Pear after work with some coworkers while I was traveling to Tempe. We were looking for options for a light dinner and not your typical burger joint or Mexican food. The Perfect Pear is a good looking restaurant, decorated nice, bistro style, but not a place that would ever be super crowded. As far as the menu options go, they had some pretty creative options from flatbread, gourmet mac and cheese, tacos, salads, as well as other options.  I decided to order a chicken and spinach flatbread for us to share and then I ordered a Mediterranean salad and added salmon. The flatbread was pretty good, nothing to call home about, it was worth the try. I wish the bread was a little more crispy... nonetheless it served it's purpose. The Mediterranean salad was pretty good. It was larger than average size and the ingredients were super fresh. As far as the salmon add on ($8) the portion was like the size of a chicken finger. There was a lot left to be desired.  All in all, I am glad I experienced... and if someone asked me to go back there, I would consider. However, it wouldn't be my first option when deciding where I want to eat. 3.5 stars..."}
{"text":"Perfect!!  My first visit to Perfect Pear and loved it!  The watermelon black tea was great.  There were two of us and we both ordered salad, although all of the food delivered around us looked amazing as well.  We had the falling leaves and roasted sprouts.  Both choices were excellent and would definitely order them again.  I'm excited to return to try more of the menu...those sweet potato fries look really good!  The restaurant  was very nice and the service was excellent...very friendly and quick delivery of the food.  Highly recommend this little gem!!"}
{"text":"Double yum! Mushroom Spinach grilled cheese with a delish Broccoli cranberry side salad dish. The food was delicious and the place is adorbs! I love the outside patio."}
{"text":"The food is hit and miss for me. Some things like the tacos and salads are awesome but others are \"meh\".  I do love that this is a restaurant that provides innovative healthy options. Service is usually good. Although I have never seen the place packed, food always comes out at a slow pace. I don't mind this though, as I enjoy the time I get to spend with those I'm with. All in all, I am definitely a repeat customer. I'm not blown away by this place but it is a good place."}
{"text":"I've tried this place twice, so far. The first time was a take out order. After a 10 minute drive home, our food was still in perfect condition; still warm, not soggy, and tasty! We had a pesto sandwich, and a balcony grilled cheese concoction. We both enjoyed it so much we came back a few weeks later and dined in. The hummus nachos are to die for! I had a fancy grilled cheese and tomato basil soup. The sandwich was amazing and flavorful.. Unfortunately the soup was not so much. It was just average, but it's a pretty simple soup, so I can't complain! The place was empty while we were there, so the service was 100%! Definitely bringing some friends in to try this gem :)"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place! It's very quaint, if you like wine, you must try! They have a great happy hour and the staff is really friendly and professional. The food is perfect for a relaxing wine tasting afternoon & is also great for company functions and large groups, check them out!!"}
