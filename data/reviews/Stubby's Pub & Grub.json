{"text":"Saturday night.  Busier than norm.  2 waitresses.  Both waitresses saw us sitting at a table and made eye contact several times.   At NO point in the 2 hours we were there did either of them come to our table, never asked us if we wanted a drink or anything to eat.    Keep in mind they went to all the other tables and booths the entire night.  Awesome customer service Stubby's.  Won't be back & will make sure to tell others not to waste their time."}
{"text":"This place was ok. In town for 2 nights and reviews were good so we tried it. Has alot of craft beers and a cool menu to explain a bit about each one. Wasnt crowded and bar food was good. Bad music. Overall it was good for a few beers and some munchies."}
{"text":"appreciated the decent beer list, nice patrons, pretty attentive service at the bar despite one fail that left my meal screwed up. also liked they had sound on for cavs game but switched to music during commercials. prices were higher than i might've expected for the setting."}
{"text":"Pretty great little spot tucked away in a strip mall area. Food is great for some bar food and plenty of drink choices. Friendly staff and speedy service. Great daily and happy hour specials and usually a good game on tv."}
{"text":"If your looking for great food and a craft beer in Elyria, look no further than Stubby's. A co-worker who lives nearby suggested it, and I wasn't sure when I pulled up, but that changed the minute I walked in the door. It's a great place to meet someone for lunch, have dinner w/the kids or meet up with friends. Very casual atmosphere with a great open dining area. I ordered buffalo chicken egg rolls as an appetizer and pork taco carnita's. Delicious! Way more than I could finish."}
