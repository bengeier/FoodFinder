{"text":"This spot had the most authentic gluten free pizza I've had in the phx area! Would definitely recommend this to those with gluten allergies. The atmosphere was extremely helpful - will be back!"}
{"text":"Very happy with the industrial vibe and open space. Wide variety of food choices from lamb meatballs to vegetarian Moroccan Tangia. Great service and location downtown on Portland park"}
{"text":"This is the place to go if you want really good food, really good drinks and excellent service. Our server was Janine--she was amazing she had great recommendations and the food was to die for!"}
{"text":"Excellent service.  Drinks were served promptly and the food was delicious.  I expect this to be the next hot spot in Phoenix.  Go there before the crowds figure this gem out."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot. Been a couple times for a drink or two. Decent and different beer selection. I've tried a cocktail, thought it was good. I like their glassware and unique ingredients. Definitely could learn a thing or two drinking here. 

The ambience is what really sells this place. Love the feel and openness of it. Right on the NW corner of Portland and Central. With the floor to ceiling windows open it is easy to just sit and chill.at this bar. Art gallery/hotel/bar/restaurant. Super into it. Everything is new so it looks very clean. Sets a fantastic foundation for some truly good f+b. 

Ate for the first time today. 'Mid-day' menu. Had the Calabrese pizza and a side of the pork belly green beans. Green beans were out first. Being super hungry, I started inhaling those suckers. Very good, but I will say this:  for 6-7 dollars I could have dealt with less beans more pork belly, but hey, it was good so no complaints really. 

The pizza was also really good. Some fresh tasting ingredients. Portion was great. Honestly, could've split the green beans and pizza with my girl. Only critique would be it was pretty salty. I thought this while shoving it into my face and thought \"it's pizza dude. It probably should be a salty, greasy, mess.\" Nonetheless, I offer my take:  The (pickled?) peppers were pretty salty (along with all the other great flavors they leant), and on top of pepperoni and cheese... I just wonder if the cook added unnecessary salt, or if it's just the ingredients and I'm a loser. The flavors were great, it was salty and greasy, but it's pizza, right? 

I like this spot. It's close by and mellow. One of my new favorite spots. Will be back."}
{"text":"Checked it out....love the atmosphere....haven't really dug into the menu I had the poke bowl....not as good as other sushi places but it wasn't bad either will be back either way its located perfectly and just the type of atmosphere I like"}
{"text":"We went last night for a friends birthday and had an amazing time!  We scored 1/2 bottles of wine since it was Wednesday, amazing food, and a great atmosphere.  We were given some awesome recommendations, my favorites were the baked brie and the Diver Scallops with Short Rib Tortellini.  Amber was our server and she did an amazing job, we wanted for nothing.  Everyone at our table works in the service industry and not one of us had anything negative to say.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I have been here a few times now and tonight was over the top. The head chef Matt gave my party a few sample dishes to try as his new menu is coming out soon. It was spectacular! The food is not ordinary or typical-traditional. The food has so much flavor and the ambience of the restaurant is cool, modern, and unique. The staff are extremely professional, knowledgeable, and friendly. A Perfect place to go when hitting up downtown Phoenix. This will be one of our regular places we go to from now on."}
{"text":"Food- good. Ambience - good. Service - be prepared to wait 15 minutes for anyone to just take your order and double that to see your food.  Even when it's a small crowd.  It seems like the bartenders just aren't that aware of people waiting.  Still worth trying, just don't go if you need something quick."}
{"text":"Ok  I really love this place but am currently giving them a two because their current menu has fallen below their standards. Their happy hour is now non existent and the food quality has dramatically dropped. The Chicken Satay Skewers at $11 barely had chicken. I use to love their food here but the taste has dramatically fallen off.  The humus with grilled bread did not have enough bread to enjoy the humus and we were charged when we asked for more. In general the menu is just so less interesting than it was and has just fallen in value.  I love the atmosphere and the staff but if they don't get the menu right there is just too many alternatives for them to survive on our list of options."}
{"text":"I've been to Match several times and the food and service never disappoint. I love the decor featuring local artists and the wine list as well. My server Jess was knowledgeable of the menu and the wine choices too. If you live in the Valley of the Sun or plan to visit soon, make your way to Match for dinner, brunch or Happy Hour. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"OK - full disclosure: If I don't like something I'm not going to write about it.  Unless that something is \"holymotherofpearlthesepeoplearecrazy\" and need to be visited if nothing else but for the amazing drama; like Amy's Baking Company.

Also, if you read my other reviews you'll notice a theme.  That is - do the Chef's Choice dinner.  But only if you're adventurous culinarily (is that even a word?).  No, not every single thing you get is going to be the best you've ever tasted, but you'll walk away with a real appreciation of the chef/restaurants' talent.

OK-POKE (see what I did there?) - I took my mom there for an early mother's day.  She'd never had a chef's progression dinner and this was my chance to show off how much smarter and loving I am as a child than my brother and sister.

We arrived before they were officially seating so we sat outside.  Which turned out to be the best choice ever.  Our server, Taylor, immediately connected with my mom...which sucks for me because that meant stories of what a chalk-eater I am...er, was.  Anyway, I can't speak highly enough about Taylor without sounding like I'm hitting on her...which I'm not.  But she was perfect as a server - on this particular occasion I did want more attention spent on us than when I'm just out with my wife (see why I'm not hitting on her?).

So, we handed back our menus and said \"whatever Chef Hobbs is willing to make, bring it out.\"  What ended up happening is a 9-course dinner with some items that were on the menu, like the poke bowl, and some of that evening's specials (like the grilled octopus).  A few things that he'd never served to other guests in his entire life were also brought out.  He literally made up stuff for us.  Seriously.

Obviously not every dish was \"our favorite dish ever\".  They were all good or better, and showcased his technical talent.  But there were a few things that stood out.  Some might surprise you.

The first thing that was \"ohmygodsellthekidsformoneysowecaneatthisforever\" good were the french fries.  I'm not \"ducking\" with you - these were even better than McDonald's fries.  I know, I went there.  Next, was the linguine carbonara.  This is (at the time of this writing) an uber-rich pasta dish with linguine (duh!), pork belly, peas and a classic carbonara sauce topped with prosciutto and barely poached egg-yolk.  Sell your kids for the money to buy this.

The last thing that I'm going to tell you about is the A5 Wagu ribeye.  So tender that grandma without teeth could eat this.  You could literally mush this to the roof of your mouth with your tongue it was so tender.  I used my teeth because I had them though.

Anyway, one more thing that needs mentioning is their mescal shot.  I'm not sure it's something you could really order, but just say \"Aurora made this mescal shot with a chili-rubbed orange for this guy on Yelp and we want one\".

Well, that's finally it.  Go there.  Check it out.  Call ahead and tell them you want to do a chef's tasting meal.  Tell them about your allergies and preferences and then sit back.  Be adventurous.  It's worth it."}
{"text":"I had a pleasant experience eating at Match recently. I thought the servers were very friendly and the hotel was very interesting. I ordered the AZ Burger for dinner with a bottle of moderately priced red wine and I thought the experience was pleasant and what I ordered was delightful. I would highly recommend this place to anyone that is looking for a great atmosphere and great food!"}
{"text":"I have this place two tries. The first time my husband and I went for dinner. The atmosphere was great, the decor gorgeous!  We had the escargot, the salmon and pisas plate. We thought the food was great. However the service was pretty poor. The hostesses barely said hello and did crack a smile. Weird. We noticed someone who looked like a manger nervously pacing around with an unopened bottle of wine in hand during our entire dinner, didn't say hello or smile. Again kind of weird.  After we put our drink orders in our waitress disappeared for what seemed like forever. She popped over once during dinner whenI had to flag her down for another drink. 

We kind of brushed of the poor service considering it's a new place on a Saturday night. 

However, we returned again with family a couple weeks later for brunch and the service was even worse. Again, no smiles or warm and fuzzies from the hostesses. We had a few questions about the menu and we got a lot of \"huh?\" And \"dunno\". While taking our orders she spaced out and said \" sorry I was watching the people in the pool\"? Weird. 

As for the brunch menu, it was okay. My husband got the Korean lettuce wraps that looked like 2 small pieces of romain. Should be an app not a $14 entree. 

All in all, I don't think we will be back, which is a shame because it's got such a cool concept and  beautiful space."}
{"text":"I just had the Short Rib entre. It may have been the best I ever had. I will stay at this hotel again just to have the short ribs and drink a bottle of wine.  No need to venture out. Great views, rooms, and vibe."}
{"text":"Match is a wonderful place!  I loved the atmosphere and the very friendly staff.  The bar was excellent, and the food on the menu looked great.  We ordered a couple of appetizers and they were fresh and delivered in a timely manner.   Everything turned out wonderfully.  I am hoping this hotel is successful, because it ranks very high on creativity and cool."}
{"text":"We went for lunch. The atmosphere is great but service is terrible. Server didn't know much and she never bothered to come check on us when there were no other customers. I could see server prepping things in the bar area for later. Portions are ok size but we are not impressed. The menu does not specify any gluten free or vegan options, and when I asked server didn't know mThe drink menu looks good but we don't drink in the middle of the day. We'll have to return for drinks only. It's a new place and they have definitely not figured out things."}
{"text":"If you want to have a great dining experience you have to request Lauren as your you server, period."}
{"text":"Came for lunch today and had a great dining experience! Ambiance and presentation of food was nice. We then took a tour of the hotel Found:Re. Worth exploring!!"}
{"text":"Great place, impressive open space and modern decor. Everyone in our group enjoyed their food. We went with the cheaper end of the menu; pizza, burgers and wings. The menu is impressive and there are lots of high end drinks available. I was impressed with the iced green tea - best I've had. We would come back for sure."}
{"text":"I went here not knowing this was a restaurant attached to a hotel. That was a mistake. Unfortunately it lived up to my expectations of a restaurant attached to a hotel. Overpriced, trying way too hard to be hip, and disappointing food. I got a egg sandwich that was rather uninspired alongside a very sad salad. My friends ordered a salad with goat cheese in it. The goat cheese was left in enormous chunks, like, inch by inch cubes! I wanted to like this place but I can't recommend it."}
{"text":"I stayed at the hotel while on vacation with my father and the first night was great. Waiters were amazing!! The food was great and fresh but the second night we decide to sit at the bar and it was the worst! It wasn't even busy at all. We sat at the bar in hot Phoenix weather for 15mins without water or even a hi from the bartender. Worst service I've ever had at an empty bar. We made eye contact with the bartender with the cheapest ugly wig and she never even said \"hello sorry I'll be with you soon\" Ridiculous! Even after my father complained about the service she didn't even say I'm sorry. She just starred at him. She needs to be fired soon. The hotel is great but don't sit at the bar for a drink. Bad attitude that one. It's sad how one person can spoil the experience."}
{"text":"I ate there with three other women and we basically ordered half the menu. It was amazing. We were all absolutely blown away by everything. I got their pupusa special: duck, pate and molé. It was amazing! My personal favorite was their papaya salad. I could eat that everyday! Every dish was so well executed.

I am in love with this place. Eating here again can't come soon enough."}
{"text":"We went to MATCH for happy hour, drinks and appetizers.  The service, food and drinks were good but expensive for happy hour. I loved the atmosphere. Two cons: 1) the bar tables are too low to really eat & drink comfortably. 2) no coasters under our drinks which kept dripping on my leg with every sip. I had to ASK for a napkin under my drink to catch the condensation. Then ordered my second cocktail and again no coaster or napkin.  

Other then that, I will return. Loved the artwork and the bathroom was unique."}
{"text":"I'm holding the place to New York City standards so I may be a little harsh on the food. I had high hopes of The food, which tried to be international is mostly lackluster. The international inspired dishes don't taste that great compared to the versions I've had of them in NYC. The best dish was the pizza which was fresh and tasty. The drinks menu offers drinks that sound delicious with subtle flavors and nuance but I was disappointed in the taste of my drink. I could not taste all the flavors and ingredients that the drinks had. The staff though are really great, my server was friendly and courteous. The space is nice and modern and there is outdoor seating in nice weather."}
{"text":"For a new restaurant they are doing great getting into the flow of thing. The bartenders are very nice. Prices are quite high for the portions you receive. That's really my only complaint, besides that I loved the place. Great atmosphere and really fits into downtown Phx."}
{"text":"This restaurant is less than average with extremely bland boring food across the board. They have a Michelin star chef that must not be very involved with their offerings.  We are breakfast, lunch and bar food and it was all less than average."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, excellent happy hour (lasts til 7).  Friendly staff.  What's not to like?  Don't let the crappy picture of that pizza on the yelp site turn you off (it almost did for us!)"}
{"text":"This place was so cool, it's like an art gallery, very hip and trendy and it has some amazing paintings on the wall too. They offer varieties of wines and cocktails. 

I ordered Moroccan Spiced Chicken Bowl and my husband got Oven-Roasted Crispy Skin Salmon (photo attached in here). The Moroccan Spiced Chicken was a bit wishy-washy, lack of flavor and the chicken smells like a raw chciken. In the other hand, Oven-Roasted Crispy Skin Salmon tasted like chard and we asked the attendant about it and he cake back saying that \"per Cheft\" that was really the taste. The attendant was really helpful and he suggested to changed it and we did. However, we waited for almost 2 hours to get it unfortunately, it didnt arrive and we decided to cancel it.

I'm not sure if we will go back again because their food is a bit pricey but it wasn't good at all."}
{"text":"Tonight was our forth trip to Match. Great ambiance and amazing food. The poke, Korean BBQ ribs, pork chop ... simple the best. Great drinks and amazing wine selection. We got to meet Chef Matt tonight.  He even gave us a preview of what's to come real soon (crudo plate was over the top). And all the servers and bar staff have been great. Really cool spot. Thank you."}
{"text":"Swanky!!! Hella swanky!! Match is a really cool happy hour spot or date night even. The drinks were pretty good, I stuck with Margaritas. The rest of the party had wine. I don't remember much about the food but the samosas were pretty tasty ...  not as good as Samosas at a local Indian restaurant. Nonetheless ... grab your girls or your co-workers and head to Match one evening!!"}
{"text":"trendy spot for drinks. Not much of a beer selection. Food is ok - wish new restaurants offered straight forward food. A salad is a salad, etc. . Nice ambiance.FoundRe Rooms are eclectic & different from other hotels, which is a nice change. Check the place out."}
{"text":"The overall vibe for this place is definitely pretty upscale chill.  The music was confusing/ironic--lots of early 90's horrible pop (Christina Aguilara and Nickleback).  I loved it as I'm a late millennial, but I also recognize that it's horrible early 90's pop. Love the half indoor/outdoor setup. The apps are killer... apricot spicy wings are on point and the meatballs were tasty (but they only gave you three, and they weren't \"Spanish\" but definitely delicious.)  The bartenders all had their separate polar personalities, but all in all the service was attentive when sitting at the bar.  I'd recommend the bar/apps to anyone in the immediate area, but wouldn't recommend anyone to go out of their way for it."}
{"text":"In town for a week, and stayed at Found:Re. Have had three meals here, from late night sides at the bar the night I checked in to two sit down dinners outside. The ambiance is incredible. The staff are knowledgeable, courteous, attentive (without being intrusive), friendly, and fun. Kaia was very friendly and helpful; Jess, you ROCK. 

As for the food...all I can say is that each dish and every side, to include the evilly good desserts, is the visual and taste equivalent of a well orchestrated fireworks display. I have to admit that the first time that I liked at the menu, all I could think of is \"oh, well, another trendy place that takes itself too seriously\". But I couldn't have been more wrong. Everything is fresh, prepared perfectly, presented like a piece of art, and is do pack with complimentary flavors, textures, and in some cases temperatures that each bite is an entirely new experience from the previous. I have one more night here, and although I generally try to try a variety of places when I'm on the road, I know I just return here and treat myself to a new section from the menu. 

And, not to be forgotten: even with the obvious painstaking preparation, incredibly fresh and diverse ingredients (locally sourced), and professional staff, the prices are incredibly fair. I will be hear each time I'm in Phoenix, and I will recommend it to ALL I know are heading this way."}
{"text":"Love the hotel. Breakfast was overpriced. Psuedo-self-service - order at the counter and go to the coffee thermos. Enjoyed the patio area and the sweet bacon bits in my omelet."}
{"text":"We came here for our graduation party.  I'm so glad we chose this restaurant.  I made a reservation for 15 people and all showed up.  I was running a little late, but they were very accommodating.  We were sat in the initial area to the left of the hotel as you walk in.  It was a perfect space that allowed us to mingle and walk around with friends without feeling to restricted to space in the main dining area.  Our server, MacKenzie was so accommodating and on top of it with food and drinks.  If you don't already know they have happy hour until 7pm even on a Saturday (amazing!). Everyone was able to get their orders in for drinks, including our bottles of champagne.  We shared many appetizers and also ordered entrees. It was an incredible evening with amazing service and people. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This review is for the drinks and atmosphere,  as we came after dinner elsewhere.   Love the decor,  really unique.  Menu had a nice selection.  I had their specialty negroni, which used a mango compari, I believe,  instead of the regular compari, making it yellow instead of the normal red.   Tasted like a regular negrino though,  but still good.  Love the glasses they serve the beer in as well.   Parking can be difficult,  so use their valet,  which is free for two hours.   Will be back to try food."}
{"text":"Well the experience is found.re was great and a big reason why waa match. Match is super chic great decor the open layout is awesome you can see the front desk the patio the kitchen and pool all from the bar. We went there for a vodka tasting and since we got there early we had some drinks and some food.  The food the roasted veggies and hummus were so good. Also the wings were great because of the spicy peach wings sauce. Also I had onenod the best drinks I've had in a while here,,,the amaro sour. That's a.great drink. We also had a few samples from  the bartender as he was prepping for the vodka tasting the staff was friendly all the guys were very welcoming and the whole time We were there we were thinking that we had to come back soon lol. Great place guys hit it up"}
{"text":"Innovative. Fun. Tasty!

We had a great scotch cocktail, a yummy venison paella, a nice shrimp/noodle salad ...  Good atmosphere. Service was great. We will be back."}
{"text":"Went to Match for Thanksgiving dinner with a girlfriend. They had a set menu for $38 dollars. Not too bad I suppose. Except we had reservations at 6pm and they were already substituting items from the menu because they had run out. Portions were downsized and people were told they had to wait on some items to be prepared because they ran out. Horrible planning on the restaurants part. They even ended up closing early because they ran out of things. The only reason I'm giving this restaurant two stars is because of our amazing server Makenzie. She was amazing and apologized greatly for the inconvenience, you could tell the wait staff was quite embarrassed about the entire ordeal."}
{"text":"Lobby bar and so much more. 
Went for a holiday happy hour and was pleasantly surprised. 
Ambiance was spot on. Groovy sexy vibe. Local art throughout with an understatement of class. Nicely done. 
Food is not your average fair. Expect some new flavors a little spice and unusual combinations that were put together very nicely. I'm looking forward to coming back for dinner. 
Service was also spot on witch can be very hard in this part of town. 
Happy hour drinks were all different than normal as well and should also be on the drink menu. The missing star is for the drink menu which has gone to far of the edge; trying way to hard in my opinion. However with that being said it is pushing boundaries. It really deserves a 4.5."}
{"text":"I've been here twice the first just for drinks & had terrible service the second time for dinner & the food was pretty disappointing. When you serve an a la carte entrée I think you really need to make sure that featured item is prepared perfectly and flavors are amazing this was not the case. I ordered the sea bass which was visually under cooked therefore texture was a serious issue as well as taste. Under seasoned & under cooked. I wouldn't go back & it's walking distance from my place."}
{"text":"It's tough to leave this review because the food was pretty good and the atmosphere was great but there were just some things that occurred that negatively affected our experience. Our server was sweet but when my friend asked for chicken sausage, he got a plate with bacon on top. When he mentioned that he asked for chicken sausage, she takes the plate to the kitchen, took the bacon off and gave him the same plate and said the chicken sausage will be right out. The salad was even wilted from the bacon. He doesn't eat pig and that just seemed super inappropriate, along with it not seeming to follow health code. Also, when I asked for a mimosa and to only have a little orange juice because I don't like it sweet, she said sure! And then proceeded to tell me that it'll be a minute because they're making the mimosas. Clearly, they were pre made which is understandable!! But don't tell me sure, and then give me a mimosa full or orange juice. Again, she was nice but just a little spacey."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Found:Re recently and got a credit to eat at Match.  Love the ambiance, but the food and the service was lacking.  I ordered a steak, it came out overcooked and lacked any real flavor.  Came with some soggy fries.  The waitress disappeared when it was time to pay.  If I stay at the hotel again (likely) I will venture out to eat on Roosevelt or somewhere else nearby."}
{"text":"The restaurant was put together so perfect. The ambience and aesthetic is A+! The food is elevated street food from around the world. Mostly locally sourced and sustainable menu. Every item on the menu has a story! The staff is so friendly and knowledgeable. The have a great bar and specialty cocktails are unique and interesting. The wine options are wonderful. I had a glass of a Pinot Blanc and it was fantastic. If you have a chance, book the chef's table and be prepared to have a great night!"}
{"text":"Their menu is a bit limited but everything I tried I liked. Cocktails didn't seem to be anything to write home about. It does have wonderful ambiance which totally made up for the crappy experience I had parking and walking blocks to the place. Pro tip- you can totally valet with the hotel for 2 hours for free if you eat there."}
{"text":"Really small portions. The chicken adobo was extremely salty. The chicken itself was a small piece and was over cooked and dry. Nice atmosphere but restaurant needs work."}
{"text":"Went mid day. Was pretty dead. But staff were friendly and helpful! I didn't like my drink but the bartender warned me I wouldn't! I took one star off because the bar had that \"weird\" smell that some bars have. I don't know if it's the water or drainage or what. Probably something out of their control."}
{"text":"Spectacular lunch place. I had the salmon Greek salad, and the salmon was cooked perfectly. The salad itself was nuanced and flavorful. Paired with their Riesling made for a perfect lunch. My wife had the arugula and endive salad paired with a Sauvignon Blanc, which was also delicious. Both salads were tasty without being slathered with dressing, a common mistake made by second-rate kitchens. The service was A-one. The portions were on the money. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"LOVE Match.  This was my second visit and it was just as great as the first.  I had the Salmon and my boyfriend enjoyed the braised beef.  Both are to die for.  Our group ended up ordering every dessert.  Delish.  As great as the food was, the service was better.  Our server, Taylor was awesome.  She made us feel welcome and she set the tone for our evening.  Perfect.  We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Located in the Foundre hotel this super chic bar and restaurant was a new sight for us. We were traveling down town for an event and decided to park and ride with the light rail. Afterwards we saw this bar called the Match cuisine and cocktails and were sold. With open floor to ceiling windows next to comfy seating it was perfect for a enjoyable and refreshing beer and snack. My fiancé had the Hinano lager from Tahiti and I had the Indian Pale Ale from Mother Road in flagstaff (a favorite of mine)  and also decided to order the wings. Every thing was delicious, and our bartender Mike was helpful and courteous in every way.  I would highly recommend coming here for diner, a drink with friend, a staycation, anything really! Super chic- this place is a must return."}
{"text":"Wow. How can a restaurant be this good when it just opened? Excellent, informed and friendly wait staff, a terrific local-focused menu and incredible space. They spent time and money to do this place right, and it shows. We went Friday night for dinner and returned Saturday for drinks and had a top notch experience both nights. I will be a regular at Match!"}
{"text":"Nice place near downtown Phoenix
Southwest flavor. Would come here again. Went here for breakfast. Reasonably priced. I had egg huevos rancheros. My wife had the Match Egg breakfast."}
{"text":"As a graphic design junkie, I was jonesin' to get to Match based alone on their logo, but never got around to it. Then, they rebranded, and I was significantly less interested. I was a snob and a fool.

Tucked into the Found:Re, this place is really hip and modern, with a number of different seating options. Because we had a good sized group and it was really nice out, we opted for a larger high top on the patio. The chairs were cushy and amazing, though shockingly heavy to pull out.

A group of us made our way over here after a taco festival at Margaret T Hance one weekend, and were pleased to find that their happy hour is every day from 3-7, and offers some pretty poppin' deals. It's $5 for a beer, and $6 for select cocktails and wines, and a good deal on little snack foods too. Unfortunately, we were all exploding with tacos, so we didn't get to sample any of the food,

I started off with the old fashioned, the drink by which I measure all bars, and was underwhelmed. I know, I know, it's not specifically a whiskey or cocktail bar, and I know, I know, I'm a big ole snob. But, it was a pretty weak-tasting old fashioned that was heavy on the simple syrup and served over standard ice from a machine. But, at $6 a pop, I couldn't be overly upset about it. One of my friends had the pearfect margarita, which she also said was just like drinking juice--heavy on the sugar, not so heavy on the tequila. 

I switched to the red blend and it was easy coastin' the rest of the night. My one other gripe was that it seemed like they were out of a handful of items on their menu. Not a huge deal, just a little bit annoying. 

Next time I'm in the area, I'll be back again during happy hour to try some of the other drinks and definitely get in on them food deals."}
{"text":"Chef Matt and team are providing authentic Arizona cuisine with imagination and flair. Their creative menu, fine staff and outstanding wine list are not to be missed while in Phoenix. This cuisine compares favorably with the best restaurants in the world! We love it!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyable first experience here. Nice ambiance. I hope the menu continues to grow. This and the hotel are a great addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Live DT, came for drink after dinner. Decent crowd and the place has edgy feel. Definitely not the bar for purists as the vodka tonic had a flavor/additive. Works great for hipster crowd. Full operating window panels would be great at night in another 40-50 days but it is 8pm and 54 degrees outside.  Complimentary biz tip...you would sell a lot more alcohol if the temp in the bar was warmer than my vodka tonic."}
{"text":"Since I'm a local & within walking distance. I decided to walk over with a good buddy for a lunch meeting..  Tried the lobster Bisque and pizza .. Both were great .. Really liked the atmosphere of this place .. all the windows were open , the art work was amazing and the staff were suggestive and polite ..    

Round 2.. later that eve we returned for another meeting and some evening drinks and dishes .. 

While the service was a little shaky at first, the server was very polite and personable. I wasn't starving so tried some side dishes ... One of my friends is vegetarian & I don't eat pork.. I ordered the green beans without pork which they gladly accommodated and the frites w/ both the garlic aoli   & Korean ketchup, & ( no it's not heinz w/ Sriracha sauce ) Both were great and hit the spot .. Then as a nightcap we all dove into their specialized cocktails ..  I chose the Hong Kong apothecary .. The wait was longer than expected and with our current drinks empty I walked up to the bar to see what all these drinks entail .. 

Once received, I tried my drink ..  It was a drink I would not normally want to try but I was feeling like going outside my comfort level .. In the end. I finished it and enjoyed to interesting notes of this unique cocktail ..

In all the ambiance and the food are perfectly paired .. I'm excited to have this place in my neighborhood and will likely make this new place my stomping grounds"}
{"text":"This is \"FOUND: RE\" hotel's restaurant and bar. The hotel itself has all kinds of packages on their website, a \"Romantic Package\", a \"Risque Package\", and of course you can just check out a room without buying a package. The bathrooms near the front desk are very neat, like train or airplane compartments, very well made and wonderfully designed too. Throughout the hotel is a lot of artwork, mostly local artwork so that was nice to browse through.

The restaurant was interesting, very modern, it haf LED's, couches, and was beautiful and comfortable. It has mainly Italian and American food. I just ordered a beer so I can't really comment on the food. But as for the atmosphere and space, it was very enjoyable to explore and be there, extremely relaxing environment. There's also a ballroom in the building which you can rent, just ask the front desk!"}
{"text":"Can I please give this place 6 stars?! We went here because of MATCH's support for the Southwest Center for HIV's Dining Out for Life event today, and couldn't be more impressed. Besides the restaurant's trendy vibe and the AMAZING art on display, the service and culinary artistry was on point. 

When we arrived for breakfast, we were greeted by the most lovely hostess. She was courteous, friendly, and familiar. She made us feel at ease and completely welcome. After a lovely conversation about favorite vacation spots, she introduced us to our waiter (Daniel). He was informative, attentive, and extremely knowledgeable about the food. When he came back to refill our coffee mugs, he even remembered our names. Are you kidding me? Who does that? That's an insane level of customer service and truly showed us how much they cared for our experience.

When the food came out, it was absolutely sublime. I had the El Benedicto, which was an Italian twist on eggs benedict. Fluffy cubes of bread sat atop a lovely balsamic glaze and the perfectly poached eggs were drizzled in a savory hollandaise and garnished with crispy prosciutto flakes. My better half had a wonderfully creative shakshuka dish (add your own ingredients) with heavily toasted bread. A perfect blend of middle eastern flavors and influences for breakfast. 

The best part, though? How surprisingly affordable breakfast was. It felt like a gourmet experience for an insanely reasonable price. I'd highly recommend MATCH Cuisine to any food lover in Phoenix and beyond!"}
{"text":"Good restaurant! Decent bar. Staff was a little inattentive but everything was really tasty"}
{"text":"We went here for Easter Sunday to do the bottomless mimosas. It's $15 if you buy an entree as well. The mimosas kind of took a while to come out. Not very bottomless, but still not a bad deal. The windows swing out to make it more of like a patio style dining experience. The breakfast burrito is incredible! Decent service. The breakfast menu is priced well but the dinner is slightly overpriced. Very good food overall. Just docked for service."}
{"text":"Awesome food, great service! Very cool decor and art around the hotel/restaurant. The pizza was great and was made in a pizza brick oven. Great new spot and I would highly recommend it! The patio has great people watching views on Central Ave. They have happy hour from 4:20 to 6:20pm haha."}
{"text":"It's hard to gauge a place that I went to for just one drink, but I'm only likely to ever come here if it's late and I'm staying at FOUND:RE hotel, since it's downstairs. (2 hours validation for parking at hotel if you dine in)
Honestly the bartender was working really hard and I think he was a nice guy. He was by himself working the bar, serving around 12 customers. Pineapple wheat beer and their spritzer that tasted like a fancy dirty shirley were great. Pimm's cup was really sour. Not bad but my friends didn't like it. Definitely to sweet. I'm getting too old for cocktails. 

We were denied service when my 22 year old friend showed a vertical drivers license that doesn't expire until the end of the year. **Note HB-2031 bill allows OUT OF STATE vertical ID cards to be accepted. * it's been in effect since 2016 because many out of state tourists couldn't even enjoy a drink because their new licenses have yet to be issued. The bartender asked his manager and she/he said no. The bartender said he didn't want to lose his job because we could be undercover cops. So we left. We looked up the vertical ID Law and saw the bill to allow put of state people to get alcohol with a vertical ID. My boyfriend informed management. We wanted to still get our drinks so we went back down. And the management had STILL not informed her bartender. So when we went down we had to wait form him to get permission from his manager. 

It was just a very unfortunate situation with the staff being more concerned with saving their own butts than actually knowing the current laws. It would have been nice if management had at least informed staff of the new information that had been shared with her."}
{"text":"Place is nice, but the service sucks. Sat down at the not very busy bar and was ignored for 10 minutes until the bar back asked us if we had been helped."}
{"text":"This restaurant became a favorite of my fiancé and I after trying it for the first time last year. We celebrate just about every holiday and special occasion here now. The food is absolutely delicious, all of it tastes so fresh and flavorful. The interior design is beautiful and the staff have alway been accommodating and helpful! The management has truly outdone themselves with every aspect. My favorite dishes here are the hummus and veggies, lobster bisque and gnocchi. We just can't say enough great things about this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Got to experience Match for the December 1st Friday, and I can't wait until I go again! the meat ball and escargot were by far my favorite dishes of the evening! Staff was attentive, personable and gave educated recommendations."}
{"text":"This is an awesome place to dine! We sat on the patio. It was a beautiful evening! The appetizers were delicious Spanish Meatballs and veggie skewers! YUM! I had the Braised Short Rib, My wife had the Crispy Pork Belly. Everything was incredibly prepared and the flavors out of this world! I more than highly recommend this eatery! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This may be one of the most well designed hotel/bar/restaurants in Phoenix.  Unfortunately, the food (lunch) fell short.  While I had an OK sandwich (with no sides), my lunch partner had two unappetizing Jamaican Patties simply thrown on a plate.  I'm not big on presentation, but...He was equally unimpressed after the meal.  On the up side, the service was good, but they will need to greatly improve their lunch game to get me back for a meal.  For now, I'll stick to going back for drinks."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a Sunday for lunch. Very nice area and really cool looking boutique hotel. We had the kale salad and mushroom flatbread. Both were excellent! I didn't realize that parking is free for two hours in the garage if you eat at Match. However, I was fortunate enough to get street parking on Portland."}
{"text":"The food wasn't too bad, fairly average. My wife and I use open table to book almost all of the restaurants that we go to and this one wasn't an exception. We had earned a $20 reward and you have to schedule it online at a restaurant to use it so we did for MATCH. At the end of our meal our waiter came out and told us that they didn't accept those and that they didn't participate with open table even though we used the app to make and appointment and they had revived it. So we lost our $20 reward. When we asked if we could see a manager the waiter said they couldn't come out. So we asked the waiter to check again if we could use the reward. When we asked the GM there said they refused to speak to us and that they wouldn't give us any compensation on our bill. Super super rude management. The waiter told us that turn over there is super high and that people aren't around very long. No reason to go back and you shouldn't either."}
{"text":"I know anything covered in butter and cheese is delicious, but I've been having dreams about Match's escargot. 

Jesus, if heaven were a food. 

Pretty sure heaven for me is just that, a bunch of food. Just a giant, all-you-can-eat buffet without the guilt. No guilt because it's heaven, and everyone knows the greatest miracle of all is having permission to commit the greatest sin of all: gluttony. And Match's escargot with crusty bread is definitely in the lineup.

So in closing, go to Match and have a religious experience. 

Bless this highly nutritious meal of snails soaking in fat and the sweet waitress who served them to me. Amen."}
{"text":"The foods ok, the cocktail aren't great either, and the view is of a grassy area with homeless people laying out... the service was good, the manager was wonderful"}
{"text":"I don't give away five stars easily but given the service and food, Match deserves it. As you enter, the local art beckons.  The curator has done an amazing job of selecting pieces for their expansive gallery walls. There are backlit pop art pieces, including a heat sensitive floor and much more. 

The food is primarily locally sourced, including an amazing selection of local wines. I selected the award winning  Pillsbury Vineyard of Cottonwood, AZ...a crisp white wine that was very good.  Food is somewhat family style. We picked the lamb meatballs, a delicious Papaya salad, Bombay samosa, Marrakesh Tinga, and Match Poki. We loved our selections. The service was A plus. We will be back for sure!!! A gem.  If you love food and art, this place is for you."}
{"text":"MATCH is on the bottom floor of the Found-RE Hotel on Central Ave in downtown Phoenix.  This is SO NOT what I think of for a hotel restaurant.  It's an art exhibit, urban, trendy, current.  Amazing and fun.  First, walk through the lobby.  Fun little plaques that represent the RE in the hotel name (i.e. the elevator is RE - lift, the door mat is RE-tread, the bathroom is RE-lief).  The floor, ceilings and walls all exhibit some type of art flair.  

Then we entered MATCH.  Our maitre de/waiter, James,  greeted us by name and showed us to our table by the window.  He was friendly, knowledgeable, helpful, everything a good waiter needs to be.  I was swept away by my dinner.  Short ribs in a red wine sauce over puffy, yummy potato gnocchi.  It melted in my mouth and went perfect with my glass of wine.  Our entire party enjoyed their dinner.  My husband felt it was rather pricey but you do have the alternative of sitting at the bar for some less expensive fun choices.  And I thought my dinner was well worth the price.

I can't wait to go back again and would definitely ask for James."}
{"text":"Be honest, how many times have you had Italian and Peruvian in the same meal?  That's a rhetorical question because anyone who just raised their hands is a liar.  That is unless of course you've been here before.  Match is the signature restaurant for the new Found:RE Hotel on Central & Portland.  It's a stones throw from my apartment Downtown so naturally I'm happy to have another option nearby.  But how does a mishmash of seemingly incompatible cuisines measure up?

Found:RE Hotel takes over what once was (a LONG time ago) a Best Western that had been abandoned for years.  It was an eyesore and something I was eager to see torn down as it gathered dust and was a blight on an otherwise beautiful boulevard on Portland Street.  And then suddenly a group of investors swarmed in to resurrect the old hotel building giving it a complete overhaul and adding a street side restaurant called Match.  The restaurant is huge with seating for probably close to 200 people at full capacity (probably more with standing room only space).  I took a stroll through here on opening night to look around and it was jam-packed with Downtown workers, neighborhood locals, and hotel guests.  I figured I'd give it a little time before coming back to let the crowds dwindle a bit and for Match to work out the initial growing pains every restaurant inevitably faces.  On a Friday during Happy Hour, I was able to plant myself at the bar and get served right away.

If you haven't viewed Match's website yet you should know in advance that Match's menu is pretty extensive.  In part because this restaurant is open pretty much all day every day.  This always makes me a little nervous when I see this as I've found those restaurants that try to be good at everything are often not great at anything.  But I did a little research in advance of coming here so as to not be overwhelmed when choosing my fix for the evening.  The bar staff was also super friendly and lent me their expertise as well.

For a drink starter, i had the Peruvian Pearls.  I love me some pisco sours and this was certainly similar to the ones I've had in the past, though their rendition was more potent than others I've had.  Not overpowering, but plenty of alcohol and enough spice to keep your taste buds wide awake.  I'd arrived a little early for dinner (which they don't normally serve until 5pm), but I had my heart set on the Gnocchi & Meatballs.  The bartender was kind enough to have an exception made for me so that I could grab that dish a little earlier than usual.  This absolutely lived up to the hype.  I'm a sucker for gnocchi and this version was phenomenally tender and buttery.  And the meatballs and meat sauce that went with it were an amazing accompaniment.  How come I've never seen Italian restaurants serve this?  And then there was dessert.  And in my case, a trip back to Peru for this one (albeit with a twist).  The Peruvian Posset dessert is just as much art as it is a meal.  The specs on this one: Lime curd, custard, donut holes, and sweet potato chips.  It makes almost no sense at all, but an elegant presentation and even better flavors.

Total cost for the meal, the drink, tax and tip came to about $50.  A little on the steep end perhaps, though I certainly can't knock the creativity of the chef or the menu.  Besides Peruvian and Italian dishes, I caught glimpses of Indian, Greek, Argentinian, Chinese, Japanese, Jamaican and yes even Mexican influences on the menu here.  A truly global menu that tries to find a way to merge seemingly polar opposite gastronomic influences.  Its a great fit for the Found:RE hotel, itself a boutique hotel that's about as different as any you'll find Downtown.  So welcome to the neighborhood, Match.  Keep on pushing the envelope and finding new ways to put a spin on the food and drinks we think we know."}
{"text":"First time here. I love the atmosphere. It's a very chic, modern, hipster location. The food was amazing. Our server was very helpful and informed us of how everything is made with local produce. What else can you ask for?"}
{"text":"We were just looking for some mimosas on a Monday morning, and were having a harder time than expected. We didn't order food here, but sat at the bar and ordered their $5.00 margaritas (every Monday)! They were incredible. There was a variety of specialty margaritas that were tasty, and our bartender, Joey, was such a sweetheart! We'll be back again."}
{"text":"The brunch here is amazing!! Eggs Benedict were some of the best I've had. Also, their cocktail selection is on point!"}
{"text":"We stopped in tonight for happy hour and had a great experience!  Beautiful, cool space to display unique art...friendly bartenders...and a nice selection of cocktails, beer and wine.  My husband was so excited that they carry Lumberyard Red Ale and I thoroughly enjoyed my fermented pineapple, cinnamon and prosecco cocktail.  We'll definitely be back and try some food next time."}
{"text":"This place is a must for anyone local or visiting the downtown Phoenix area!  I LOVE the breakfast counter service and the new smoothies added to the breakfast menu are AMAZING!!!  The staff is so friendly and attentive.  I always enjoy myself when I am here.  While breakfast is my favorite, I also enjoyed the fettuccine as well.  Delicious on all accounts!!!"}
{"text":"Loved it. The food is great and the staff is amazing. Love the art and atmosphere. I had shrimp special which was delicious. This place seems more like a special occasion type of place rather than a go to spot for me."}
{"text":"Tried this place on a whim after a downtown event and was sadly not impressed! Our waitress was fine, helpful, attentive, and sweet. But the food. Not memorable. Had brussels sprouts as a side and they were a little undercooked/hard and just not flavorful. I feel like it's hard to mess up brussels! Cook them long enough, get them crispy even, and soak them in something (balsamic?) and you have a winner for 95% of the population. 

We had some appetizers, salads, and nothing was quite right. One of the salads had like a Parmesan cheese crisp sandwich thing with too-much cheese. The \"greens\" on the side of every appetizer and dish were not good - maybe try some nice spicy arugula? Not sure what those greens were but they were not good. There was just no balance or flow to the food.... nothing was special and nothing was memorable. It wasn't bad, just not worthy of spending my money. Uninspired I guess. Where's the love?

The ambience is wonderful! We sat on the patio and bar looks pretty sweet and everything inside was just delightful, including the artwork in the lobby. 

Like another reviewer mentioned, this place has so much potential but it is just untapped with the current menu. I feel like it's more like 2.5 stars, but I'm a round-up kind of girl."}
{"text":"First visit to this spot. They have been open for 45 days or so. I wanted to love it, but I did not. We ordered a pizza and it was charred black across the bottom. That was all we could taste. I liked the fries but my buddy did not. They are huge individual fries. We also shared the pastrami sandwich. It was delicious but they were very stingy with the meat. If they doubled it I might still think they were stingy. The hotel is very cool. I'm not excited to return for food."}
{"text":"MATCH is a great place for brunch, lunch, and din din's. Missy is an absolute treasure and makes your experience one to be remembered. Holly is a doll of a bartendress that mix's and makes magical drinks to keep you coming back for more. The breakfast burrito is the delicious and bottomless mimosa's never hurt. Come here and find your perfect MATCH."}
{"text":"Eclectic and inspired menu items that look AND sound amazing, but are actually.... truly phenomenal in flavor and composition. The egg white frittata is a remarkable piece of work; colorful, balanced, and vibrantly flavorful. Bonus: The Thai tea ice cream is 100%."}
{"text":"We joined several friends here this past Saturday for dinner before a show.  The food was really very good.  I had a wonderful Spanish gin and tonic.  My husband devoured his Reuben.  I had the Summer rolls.  Why only 3 stars?  Service was absolutely horrible.  I have never seen so many mistakes on everyone's check, not just one check.  He couldn't even correct them after the first try.  It took 3 tries on each check to finally get them right.  The place was not overly busy.  We were sure 2 hours would be enough time since we do this quite often.  We barely made it to the show just 2 blocks away."}
{"text":"First of all, the atmosphere and style of the place are top-notch!  Service was excellent and super friendly.  This restaurant could easily be packed and be a new downtown favorite if it weren't for the menu.  The menu items just didn't seem appealing to me or they were missing a crucial ingredient.  There just weren't enough options.  My dinner date and I settled for the burger.  Sounded good on the menu, but it wasn't anything special.  I actually had to eat most of it with knife and fork because it fell apart because the bread of the bun just didn't hold up.  I didn't taste much of any special sauce.  I realize this is a hotel restaurant, but it could be so much more.  We didn't have a bad experience, but we won't be back."}
{"text":"What's great:   Entry, Seating, Furniture
What's okay:  Service.
What's just not okay:  The fries which were no better than diner food.  Clearly, bagged frozen.

It's very similar to applebees in terms of food quality.  Sorry.  I know that's rough, but it's true.

I had a salmon BLT that was decent.  My wife had the Avacado toast thing.  Which was borderline good.  My kids had a couple burgers, which they said were just okay.

However, that was from more of a lunch menu.

Here's why I'll be back:  The breakfast items, at $10/plate, all looked good/great.  And a good value.  I'm going to come back in a week or two and we'll all order from that.

But the setting itself?  Top tier.  Just a really cool restaurant."}
{"text":"I went here on a Monday night around 8pm alone and for it being not that busy the service was painfully slow. I had the Caesar salad and the crispy Seabass. The food was adequate, but nothing amazing for the price.The girl who ran the Caesar salad out basically threw it on the table and didn't ask me if I needed any pepper or salt which was also not on the table. My waiter was nowhere to be found so I got up to the bar and found a pepper shaker while bartender paid absolutely no mind. So if you're looking for somewhere with mediocre overpriced food and lackluster service this is the spot for you. The decor is very nice and if they managed to dim the lights on the patio a little bit it would've been very pleasant to sit outside on a nice night."}
{"text":"Came here this evening -- 2nd day open. It's been a long time coming since I actually live in the apartments adjacent to MATCH and the new FOUND:RE hotel. It was a long year of wondering what was going to come of all this construction happening and I have to say that MATCH cuisine is a perfect addition to the Roosevelt neighborhood and arts district. You walk in to eccentric detail and I hear they have an art curator on staff so the contemporary art vibe definitely surrounds you. We walked in through the lobby of the hotel invited by a piece of a naked Burt Reynolds but I'm not mad about that lol. There was plenty of staff around to guide us to the restaurant entrance and hostess table. It wasn't busy for a Thursday evening so we were seated immediately. 

There is an open kitchen on the perimeter of the restaurant and I absolutely love that -- I have a thing for open kitchens. Our waitress greeted us and filled our water cups promptly. We were told of the specials and then faced the difficult decision of what to choose from the menu. My husband, mom and I pretty much each chose one thing from each section of the menu and here was the breakdown: 

The Coctel de Camron came out first which was basically a shrimp cocktail dish. Doused in a flavorful sauce with avocado and heirloom tomatoes... mmm!!

From the wood fire pizzas/salad: Burrueta pizza which featured Filipino longanisa. Being Filipino, we had to try it. And it did not disappoint... except for the size. It was on the smaller side-- we devoured it and I wanted more! 

Big plates: homemade gnocchi with meatballs. Boy, do I love gnocchi so this one was easily a must-have for me. The meatballs were generous size, tasty, and moist! The gnocchi was perfect and buttery and it all sat in a yummy tomato sauce. I think I'm going to have to have gnocchi every time I come here because it's also in their lobster bisque and it comes as a side as well. Do try it, trust me!! 

Our evening ended with a bang -- the chef's table dessert prepared right in front of us by the pastry chef on a silicone mat that we were to eat right off of!! Such an amazing treat! I saw it being presented to another table so (and being pregnant) I HAD TO have it. I asked so many questions as this was being done and was mesmerized by the technique and different components but here's what I remember: ganache, soft almond crumble, dark chocolate soil, chocolate mousse, shortbread cookies, dulce de leche sauce, coconut cream sauce, locally made Scooptacular coconut ice cream (which I am a HUGE fan of!)... (see my photo of it!) do yourself a favor if you're celebrating or just want to treat yourself, DO THIS! You'll thank me later. 

I can't say enough great things about this place and it was only our first time for dinner. This first impression was everything: to the inviting decor, friendly staff and excellent chefs, and most importantly, the food. I can't hardly wait to come back for breakfast and lunch because I heard those menus were even better. Let's just say I am so glad to live in the neighborhood. Downtown Phoenix has a new gem in town."}
{"text":"Such a great restaurant! The food, ambiance and staff are all fantastic! Perfect place for a nice brunch or happy hour, and their dinner menu is to die for. My new favorite Downtown Phoenix restaurant!"}
{"text":"Well, this place has a ton of potential. I love the ambiance - wide windows that slide open on a fine day, a small outdoor patio where you can nosh at happy hour and generally friendly service. Had I written this review after my first couple of times there, I would have likely given four or five stars but they've really changed up the menu and I'm unimpressed. My hunch is that the chef behind the menu has also changed and that's what is driving my discomfort. It's become really ordinary and sort of bar food menu as opposed to the interesting dishes they had in the past. It's also not cheap so they need to pick up their game. When you change up a menu, don't scrap the whole thing. Make seasonal changes to the things that are working - your consistent loyal customers will thank you."}
{"text":"I've had breakfast and dinner here. All that's missing is the lunch review. For breakfast, I had the avocado salmon toast with poached eggs. It wasn't very big but it was good. It came with an arugula salad that had some sour cream looking dressing and radishes. The salad was way too salty and that's coming from someone who loves salt. They had a station where you get up and get yourself coffee. It was a bit deceiving because it seemed that it would be free but wasn't. Why have a station for coffee if you'll charge? Then you might as well get it for me in standard waiter practice. In short, it was good but I wasn't impressed.

Dinner was a different story. I had the pina moscow mule which was tasty and the garlic shrimp with pasta. Though small, it was a plate to remember. I would recommend dinner here! It is pricey but the ambiance on the outside patio makes it well worth it."}
{"text":"Short Story - NOT BAD FOOD but the food I tried this time was very underwhelming. 

The restaurant at the Foundre is NEW AGAIN! At the time of this review (9-24-17) Match Cuisine & Cocktails is under a different Chef. But I picked this restaurant because I LOVE the whimsey artsy museum atmosphere and more importantly the restaurant week menu sounded amazing and was among my favorites.

Longer Story-
My first course was the Tabbouleh with Ahi. The Ahi and the Non-Traditional Tabbouleh lacked flavor. Onions were unusually strong. It was ok but I wouldn't want to eat this again.


Main Course was the Halibut. I do have to give credit to whoever cooked the fish that it was textbook perfect with a great sear and the fish was moist and flakey...just right. The vegetables were all prepared with a nice caramelization (tomato wedge was slow roasted). But it was the parsley sauce that was very flat and one note. This dish was good and nothing was wrong with it but it wasn't interesting at all. I wouldn't come here to have it again.

I was hoping that dessert would wow me ....just a little bit.

Then my heart just dropped out of my chest and I almost choked when I saw the dessert.

We received two bowls smeared with a small amount of tapioca pudding that was mixed with small bits of chopped fruit and topped with toasted coconut. This dessert was depressing. It made me think of the $1.50 puddings that many diners back east used to serve that taste better with a little cinnamon and whipped cream. The tapioca also reminded me of Hunts Snack Packs...but doctored up and a little.....

My husband pretty much had a similar experience. Some things were good like the gnocchi and the short rib was good but many things to him were also underwhelming. 

Our waiter was great and attentive. All the staff seemed welcoming.

I stopped by the restrooms on the way out and most of them were a disaster. Looked like frat boys or a pack of wild animals did a number 1 & 2 on them.

My husband let the man at the desk know about the restrooms.

2.5 stars"}
{"text":"I went there for Thanksgiving lunch since I was meeting up with friends for a dinner later. The place is beautiful and the wait staff was very nice. I can't speak to the full menu. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Green papaya salad was amazing! Awesome hotel with great staff and a terrific local vision."}
{"text":"Much, much more than just a restaurant. Match is a restaurant, art gallery, hotel and environment unique unto itself. Our group started in the restaurant where we had a sampling of the food along with introduction to the Chef, who gave a nice philosophy of his cook and inspiration for his dishes. And his food was great, a standout for me was the beet salad. Locally grown baby beets prepared in a unique way that made them the best darn beets I have ever had. All of the food is procured in and procured from the surrounding area, so there is a definite respect and support for the local growers. A wide variety of offerings and various specials throughout the week make the dining experience something new every time. The decor is a knockout, with local artist's work on the walls and the even the seating, tables and bar are works of art. Industrial style art done very well, tasteful, beautiful and fun. MATCH is right on the light rail line, in the center of the Art area of the city. A great place to meet for any type of date or gathering of friends, relaxed and friendly."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stayed in the FOUNDRE hotel (awesome hotel btw) and had a $25 credit for the Match restaurant that it's attached to. We decided on breakfast and got the avocado toast (giant piece of toast topped with avocado, scrambled eggs, capers, tomatoes and arugula) and a breakfast burrito (eggs, cheese, potatoes, chicken)- both of which were delicious. My boyfriend took a bite of his burrito, looked at me, gave me a slow nod in approval, and whispered/sang \"MoneyYyYy\"- so it must be good. Two complaints- first, the toast was so hard, my jaw cracked every time I chewed. Second, the coffee was awful. AWFUL. Get a specialized drink instead."}
{"text":"Super cute decor and atmosphere, but the food was just average. I tried the Grateful Shroom Pizza ($10), the Steak Frittes ($24), and the Caipirinha de Dia cocktail ($9). 

The mushrooms on the Grateful Shroom Pizza tasted delicious and the crust was perfectly cooked, but the sauce and cheese flavors didn't compliment the mushrooms very well. The Steak Frittes were very good (albeit a little cold), I subbed out the fries for the Wood Grilled Green Beans, which were amazing!

Unless you are very adventurous with your drinks, I would steer clear of the cocktails here. They have some very \"interesting\" ingredients in their cocktails like beets and an assortment of international alcohols that will leave you googling half the ingredients in your drink. I tried to play it safe with the Caipirinha de Dia cocktail, but found it to be only mehhh-worthy."}
{"text":"Awesome food! The cocktails to start were very tasty. Then we had a variety of food that we shared. Everything was super yummy. Would definitely recommend the green beans and the fries! The arugula and endive salad was really good but I think I would order a second goat cheese sandwich since it was so good! 
The over environment of the restaurant is modern with lots cool artwork!"}
{"text":"Get here before the the secret is out! Amazing food, sexy ambiance, excellent service, and great prices!  This art gallery and industrial style restaurants and bar is a real gem not to be missed!  The food is amazing and prepared with passion.  We had the opportunity to talk to the head chef himself, who perfected his skills in high-caliber competitive restaurants in San Francisco and Las Vegas, and it shows.  He chose to give up the highlife and spend more time with his family, which is how such excellent knowledge and passion for food ended up on our extremely reasonably priced plate.  Take advantage of this gem before everyone else discovers it!"}
{"text":"Sexy, sleek interior......friendly servers, but the food was kind of blah!!  We tried a variety of dishes, gnocchi, pizzas, sandwiches, green beans........none were horrible, but nothing really stood out as really delicious.  We were there in the first few days of opening so they might still have some kinks to work out.......will give it another shot before I completely disregard the place."}
{"text":"This spot sits boldly across from The Fez. It's been hanging around the corner of Portland and Central for over a year and it still doesn't get as crowded as The Fez during HH. And that is ok with me. Drinks are steady and the bartenders are fly!"}
{"text":"This is a very well conceived restaurant and adjoining cocktail bar with plenty of outdoor seating.  The atmosphere is great, and the decor is excellently put together.  We went for dinner and shared a couple of plates along with a lovely bottle of wine.  The wine list is fairly diverse but not overwhelming.  The dishes we ordered were wonderfully prepared and quite tasty.  We had the gnocchi with meatballs (odd combination - but it really does work) and one of the specials - which I can neither pronounce nor spell.  And one of the most refreshing things about the menu was the variety and diversity of different options - while still remaining somewhat streamlined.  One of my biggest gripes about many of the new restaurant openings in the Valley is the minimization of the menu coupled with a lack of variety.  Match solves that problem perfectly.  And they do it in a very tasty way!!"}
{"text":"The variety of the menu is very intriguing to me and that's what drew me into choosing this place when meeting up with one of my oldest friends who I haven't seen in awhile. She arrived before me and chose a nice table by the patio. There was a grassy greenbelt-ish area behind her dividing the tall condos nearby. It almost seemed like we were in some other city!

Anyway, back to happy hour, being a bourbon drinker, I ordered the Mizuwari - bourbon, ginger, mineragua (a Mexican club soda). It was a very refreshing, enjoyable cocktail.

I really wanted to order the Jamaican patties, but my friend was trying to stay away from beef or pork, so we agreed on..
Celery Root Hummus Appetizer -pickled veggies, warm toasted bread, paesano olive oil.  As someone who doesn't really enjoy veggies but learning to, I really enjoyed the pickled vegetables. The hummus had a thinner consistency than I'm accustomed to but it made it feel lighter with great taste. Maybe it meant it was healthier and I didn't have to feel as guilty about eating it too? Eh, wishful thinking probably but still good

Indian Butter Chicken Samosas - they had the appearance of those Chinese crab wontons but indeed were far from it and better of course! We really loved these chicken samosas. The taste and texture reminded me of really tasty empanadas but stylish looking ones. Definitely worth the order!

Gregorio Pizza - these pizzas are personal sized. Prosciutto, arugula, pine nut marscapone, and fig vinegarette. These 3 ingredients were a trifecta of my favorite tastes in one. I enjoyed this but this particular one, the cheese was a bit on the crispier overdone side so if I could re-order this perfectly, I wish the cheese was more similar to my friend's Grateful Shroom where there was more cheese and it was melted perfectly! I was having cheese jealousy looking at hers!

Filipino Kush - this I ordered to go and I was an idiot and forgot it on the table when we left!!! I am devastated because I really wanted to try this one since it was giving a shout out to my Filipino roots with housemade Longanisa sausage! I used to eat Longanisa sausages with eggs and rice for breakfast plenty of mornings. My mom always had it around! Oh well, I guess I'll have to try it another time!

The eclectic atmosphere and world inspired menu are both things that make for a great adventurous happy hour. I'm curious about trying more things next time! Hopefully that Filipino pizza will still be around for me to try it!"}
{"text":"It was our first experience at MATCH. Sarah Sowards, our server, had great suggestions. She broke down the whole menu for us and also educated us on the art throughout the entire establishment and its history. Upscale yet approachable environment . and overall experience was very impressive."}
{"text":"fantastic restaurant! awesome space and design, amazing food (try the scallops with short ribs and asparagus) and warm, welcoming, attentive service...thanks Amber! perfect place for a birthday dinner!"}
{"text":"What an incredible atmosphere. The local art adds an edgy and authentic vibe to the already hip design of the restaurant. The staff was fantastic, especially our server Sebastian who remembered each of our names. Oh, and the food was so good. Definitely order the duck spring rolls. Thank you Sebastian and the Match team!"}
{"text":"First time here. The food is great, especially the Korean BBQ ribs! Those ribs... man... don't skip out on that. You'll regret it. ;)"}
{"text":"Enjoyed my evening at MATCH Cuisine and Cocktails meeting with a client. Match is a new and trendy restaurant in Central Phoenix. Urban yet sexy with fire pit bar tables and a dining room that extends out... Even the rest rooms are inviting creatively made...LOL :-). Also over sized patio styled sliding doors to enjoy the fresh nightly desert air. Yuppie friendly staff with excellent customer service. I ordered the INDIAN BUTTER CHICKEN SAMOSAS for an appetizer...Yummy, yum, yum! I recommend MATCH and will definitely be a returning customer!"}
{"text":"Had a fantastic dining experience here the other night.  My Mom and I came in with a free entrée coupon and to celebrate her birthday a few days late.  The hostess was sweet and Sebastian was our server.  He was incredibly attentive and personable! We ordered the vegetable skewers, which were to die for, and drinks (the Indian Wells Cab & a gin and tonic). Then we split the Ribeye which was just beyond words.  So flavorful and perfectly cooked- one of those \"melt in your mouth\" meals.  To finish, we had the chocolate mousse and some coffee and then promptly retired into a food coma.  

I SO appreciated the restaurant's attention to food allergies as someone who can't have gluten.  It made the dining experience a total breeze! We will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"The vibes here are amazing! I enjoyed so many things from this restaurant from the music they were playing to all the beautiful art throughout. It's easy to spend hours here for sure. The staff was very friendly and took the time to explain their menu, and I was glad that we had a chance to meet the chef. I tried all the dishes they offered us and I do not have anything bad to say so I can not wait until I come back for brunch. My favorite dish that I did try was the octopus a la plancha! I was hesitant because I've never had octopus but I am so glad I did it was absolutely delicious. It will be a great visit even you hang out at the bar like I mentioned very nice decor throughout."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Sam Smith - Latch)

You lift my heart up 
When my appetite is down
You, you enchant me, with your beautiful restaurant
If there cocktails, I will try to knock them down
I'm Matching with Yelp
Now I know what I have found


I came here thinking of the website match.com and by no means does the word match made me think of the literal fire stick!?  Talk about great branding!

I came here on a Saturday afternoon before the wine festival.  The restaurant is beautifully laid out and the artwork was popping!  It was pretty quiet day from what I gathered but we carried on!  We started with some drinks; my partner ordered the bloody mary while I'm shot for some whiskey.  The bartender was very helpful to pick out one for my taste buds.  Needless to say, I wasn't disappointed!  

For the food we both decided to share the Lace Pancakes and Plato Paisa; grilled steak, plantains, crispy chicharoon sausage, avocado, black beans, crema, and fried egg.  Overall, the dish was plated beautifully!  You definitely had to mix the plate of ingredients together to make the flavors pop out!  I'm weird so I eat my ingredients all at once; one at a time, and that's my problem!  We ordered the steak rare and it came pretty much well done.  The egg was cooked over easy as requested.  My favorite bite of the dish was probably the sausage since it had some heat and pop; while the avocado and black bean provided some welcoming texture.  The plantains were perfectly cooked and added a dessert like ending to my entree.  The Lace Pancakes had roasted apples, maple syrup, cardamom whipped cream, and smoked almond crumble.  My thoughts, it was just an apple crisp crepe and tasted like one too.  Don't get me wrong I rather enjoyed it.

In the end, the place is wonderful and well located!  The service was not lacking any where!  I guess I had higher expectations for this place and I was somewhat disappointed.  I thought the food was okay, but nothing spectacular and though the names of the dishes were extravagant; the taste didn't follow suit.  Needless to say, I would still come back because the atmosphere seemed awesome and the service was tops! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I had MATCH bookmarked for quite some time now. I finally got a chance to go in for brunch a week or two ago before checking out the Grand Wine Festival. Pretty dead for a Saturday afternoon but we took advantage of the available window seating and I ordered myself a Bloody Mary. It was one of the better bloodies that I've had in a while. I find a lot of times the mix is too thick and not fresh. This one was perfectly refreshing and on the lighter side. 

For brunch I ordered the lace pancakes served with wood oven roasted apples, bourbon barrel aged maple syrup, and cardamom whipped cream. The apples were slightly more firm than apple pie- and added a great texture to the delicate dish. Just a heads up, the pancakes are more like crepes and not actual pancakes. They're thin and flaky, served rolled up. We also got the Plato Paisa {steak | plantains | chicharron | longanisa sausage | avocado | black beans | crema | fried eggs} as you can tell, it was a hodgepodge of different things meant to be eaten together. The sausage was the real stand out of this dish. Overall, everything we had was good, but didn't blow me away. Hence the four stars. I plan to go back and try their other menus to see what they have to offer!"}
{"text":"Restaurant week 2017 was a terrific success for MATCH at the FOUND * Re hotel in Downtown, Phoenix. Our server Fernando was incredible, from the perfect (I'm not kidding, PERFECT) wine service to the menu knowledge. He may have been one of the best servers we've ever had anywhere, and if you haven't tried the Twomey Pinot Nior I highly recommend it. Let's not shy away from the immaculate and incredibly tasty dishes of the night: the gnocchi and halibut were over capable of satisfying the palette and had beautiful touches that were sure to catch the eye. We ended with the tiramisu and it was the perfect cherry to top the perfect cake. Plan on dinner here if you find yourself Downtown."}
{"text":"Mike the Bartender is hands down the best bartender I've ever had. He made drinks that I never heard of, but each one was delicious! I had a great time here, the atmosphere and the art gallery made even better as I'm an artist myself. You won't regret trying this place out!"}
{"text":"MATCH has a cool-casual ambience that one can only find in places like a museum...or lounges attached to them. In the evening, the fires the light the patio flicker while you can faintly hear an eclectic playlist from overhead. 

The menu is full of familiar foods with twists--apricot glaze? On chicken wings?--that piqued my interest and left me unsure of what to order. Also, the happy hour menu is fairly lengthy and impressively priced. It features a subtle, refreshing pear margarita that somehow disappeared quite quickly.

Quick and efficient staff ensure a smooth dining experience with just enough presence to feel neither neglected nor constantly interrupted. 

The free street parking along Portland is usually full, but the parking garage across the street is also free and easy."}
{"text":"Ok so if I had done this back 3 months ago it would be 4 stars.  I live downtown, been to every restaurant and bar.  This place opened with a unique concept and a great staff. Good food and good drinks.  You need them all.  The staff is all gone, so is the service.  The current bar staff does not know what service is.  They are not knowledgeable of the product.  They don't know the wines.  They look sloppy, not sharp.  The bar is over staffed to the point of bad service because they have no focus.  There is no personal interaction.  If this was a stand alone bar it would be shuttered in a few month.  Get it together and don't waste the uniqueness."}
{"text":"wow love the art of this place, not just because i happened to know the artist who made the Big Logo outside the place . (it was made of recycle trash from the city of Phoenix recycle facility.  Drinks are amazing, they offer a great Happy hour and have a amazing view of the downtown city of Phoenix.  All their staff is very friendly and polite.  If you go here try their hummus is tasty with a little bite to it."}
{"text":"Good view of the city from the patio, and the cocktails/appetizers were decent enough, but the entrees were disappointing. Flavorless, overpriced, and weirdly sized."}
{"text":"Tried this place last night because I kept seeing it from my daily train commute into work. The place is beautiful and the noise level is great for talking. 

I ordered La Tabla ($14) which is a fancy cheese plate. It was good without being excellent. 

I also ordered an extremely fancy cocktail- Sailing Down the Nile which included North African Absinthe. It was wonderful and the presentation was stunning!  However, the price of $14 was hard to swallow!  Especially, since I found out that there are equally stunning Absinthe infused cocktails around Phoenix for half the price.

For dessert, I got the Valrhona Milk Chocolate Pot De Creme with Hazelnut whipped cream topping. Again, really good (just fancy chocolate pudding), but not worth the $10 price tag.

Big question: will I go back?  Probably not, even though it was a very interesting experience and I'm glad I tried it, but their prices are just too steep for what they offer."}
{"text":"I did a networking cocktail hour here so this will be limited. The fried cauliflower app was fabulous along with the humus and Nobel bread plate. I had a Moscow mule and it was wonderful and refreshing. I plan on giving the full menu a try next date night!"}
{"text":"Brand new to town. Trying EVERYTHING and really liking this place. As always, sitting at the bar. Friendly bar tenders made great recommendations and a custom cocktail (pre wine). The short rib is really good and the atmosphere is just right with this amazing weather and all around open. Will be coming back often."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. I traveled to Phoenix last week on business and went to Match for dinner one night and we hosted a reception the following night for a group of 40. I can't say it enough, Sebastian was fabulous! I saw him both nights and even though he wasn't in charge of our event the second night he still checked in with us throughout the night. There are a lot of great restaurants but it's the people who make them memorable. Thank you Sebastian, I hope he sees this! I was impressed at how he caught my name as I introduced myself to some of my clients and proceeded to address me by name the remainder of the night. Wonderful wonderful service."}
{"text":"Sorry, Match. You don't light my fire.

Met some friends here for dinner and drinks on a weekday. Don't bother trying to find parking on the street- it's not worth driving around the one way streets since they offer 2 hours of free parking at the hotel. Guess they don't want you to linger since they charge $10 after that. The artwork inside is great, the patio is lovely, and the staff so friendly that I might be tempted to hang out all evening, except that the food and drinks are a miss.

If you go expecting to test out some of the exciting-sounding cocktails on the website menu, you'll be disappointed to know they don't actually serve those in the restaurant. Perhaps the website is just not updated? Too bad. I tried the Spanish gin and tonic (mostly ice, but gin/tonic/some spices/hint of citrus) and the aperol spritz (mostly ice, club soda, just a bit of aperol and sparkling wine). I don't plan to return, but would recommend sticking to wine if you visit.

The menu sounded amazing- so many options it was hard to choose. Unfortunately, there was nothing that I would order again. 
- The mushroom pizza was served on a thin crust and desperately needed some seasoning. If there was onion and garlic as the menu promised, I couldn't taste it.
- Daily risotto was supposedly flavored with roasted and sweet corn, but it didn't have any smokey or sweet flavor that I could detect.
- The large match salad was on the small side. The ingredients were good (love the pichuberries!), but the poor thing was drowning in dressing. My bad for not requesting it on the side. I added the tuna for an upcharge and, though cooked perfectly, the seared crust lacked flavor.
- We ordered a side of roasted potatoes that tasted like oil, not the promised black garlic and garden herbs. It left a bad taste in my mouth and between 5 of us, we couldn't finish it. 

Overall, I wish there was something, anything, on the menu that I liked because the patio is perfect for Arizona weather. Sadly, I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Enjoyed some counter breakfast service. I tried the breakfast burrito, made with scrambled egg whites - it was pretty darn tasty  maybe towards the greasy side, but not crazy. Coming from the east coast, I was in early, and it was pretty quite, but staff was friendly - other than entree delivery all was self serve, but coffee was hot and good."}
{"text":"Went to the match sat dec 16th.  Awesome atmosphere! Fernando was our waitor and he was very friendly, knowledgeable of the menu, and attentive. Manager came around and gave a lot of information on the drink I ordered..the aviator..it wa AMAZING! I highly recommend the match."}
{"text":"It could be great, but it's just not. 

Parking: Find street parking near the Roosevelt Square apartments for free, if possible. It's valet only and has a limit.  The library is closed at this time, so no parking across the street. 

Service: Variable, but often bad. I have been a few times and am less than impressed. Once, we went and asked the hostess about happy hour. We were specifically there for happy hour. She sat us in the normal seating area, not in the bar, and stated we can order happy hour. Then, another hostess(?) or employee seemed irritated we had been seated and asked why we were there. We explained, and then she said it was ok. Finally, the waitress helped us and came by, and she was more than irritated that we were there for happy hour, seated in a normal area, not the bar. This is not our fault; the hostess staff said it was ok and said happy hour was served everywhere!  Anyway, whatever, we got the food from the HH menu. 

Other times, the wait staff have been apathetic, seemingly annoyed that there are people there to serve, and just ok. I went to the Urban Ale Trail, which the bar was not prepared. They did not have adequate snacks and were short staffed. Though the man right before me used his credit card, I was told cash was best. Then, after being charged AND paying, another bartender tried to ring me up. I told him I had already paid; he almost did not believe me. A few minutes later, this same person tried to ring me up AGAIN for a third time. Again, I said, I paid.  Communication should be key here.  A couple of other times, when I went for brunch, there were few people to serve, but wait staff were almost irritated that there were customers. 

Food: Not great and overpriced.  However, I have had some tasty juices in the morning. The happy hour menu had some odd pickled veggies and hummus. It was odd - just ok. There was not enough bread for the hummus. I think the brunch menu has better options. 

Ambiance: This is the cool part and why MATCH does not get just one star. This place is cool! The art work is odd but interesting. The lobby has a huge long table, which is excellent for large groups. There is an outdoors patio, and even indoors, the windows can be opened for fresh air."}
{"text":"Went today for my birthday brunch with friends...it was off the chain.  Great service and seriously, the BEST Papusa I have ever had.  Top it all with the homemade chocolate cherry ice cream and the pitcher of Mimosa's...delicious and memorable meal!!!"}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best bars in the valley! The cocktail menu ranges from local flavors to drinks from across the globe. The Murcielago was so tasty. Pair it with the chicken sandwich and you'll be golden. I can't wait to return! Ask for Adrian and he will take good care of you. Best bartender hands down!"}
{"text":"Was in town for a conference and came to Match for dinner. The service, ambiance, and food were great! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for good Italian in Downtown Phoenix. Our waiter was very attentive and made great recommendations. I had the Garlic Shrimp and Spinach Agnolotti and it was so so good. My friend ordered the risotto and it was very flavorful. For dessert we had the tiramisu which also very good. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"What a HUGE disappointment!!! I was drawn to this restaurant because of the unique menu. Ask any Filipino - you read \"filipino\" anything on a menu from a beautiful restaurant categorized as \"American (new)\", you're immediately interested.

So off hubby and I went on a Monday late afternoon around 4:30p. We turn right into the street and find a parking lot reserved for valet. Where the hell is the valet guy? We definitely missed him which is on Central. We walk to the restaurant on the left - and it was beautiful, but surprisingly big and empty. There were probably 6 customers. We wait for the hostess who by the way is absent for a few minutes. She finally gives us menus and tells us to seat ourselves. We decide on the patio- again, the patio is nice.... we wait and we wait for someone to acknowledge us. When we are finally greeted, I ask the waiter for a dinner menu as we were only given a hh and a cocktail menu. He tells us they aren't serving dinner - not until 5p. Okay...I've never heard of a restaurant to only serve HH items which by the way had only 4 or 5 food items. I also asked the waiter for a recommendation on a sweet cocktail and he suggested the Caiprinha- it was strong and awful!! Not sweet at all!! I realized our waiter is the bartender as well so service was sooooo damn slow. I counted about six employees around this big restaurant and six or seven customers so why the slow service? I don't get it. Not only that, our  waiter wasn't nice at all. He had a snotty attitude that after getting our drinks and placing our appetizer order of the samosas and hummus, we were planning to leave but honestly I wanted to wait a few minutes and see if we can get dinner menus and try the \"Filipino\" food items. That's why I came in the first place.

We finally received the hummus and samosas. The hummus was good but a little too salty. I've read other reviews on how salty some of their entrees are. Maybe they should lay off the salt a little bit. The vegetables in the hummus was delicious and the samosas were spicy and pretty good. When 5:10p hit, we were given dinner menus and I decided to order the escargot and the Filipino kush pizza. The escargot was ok - left a nasty aftertaste and the Filipino Kush pizza wasn't good. I am definitely familiar with longanisa - one of my favorite sausages of all time but with the pizza, not so much.

I was literally ready to get outta here - I wasn't very happy. The waiter didn't even notice that I only took a few sips of my cocktail - I mean that really says a lot. Even my husband's cocktail - the alpaca was barely touched. We asked for the check and left quickly. The price for disappointment (including tips): a little over $60."}
{"text":"This contemporary restaurant is a nice spot, nestled in downtown Phoenix. While the atmosphere was very modern and exquisite, the food was very small for the price. The salads were very flavorful and delicious! When it came to the main dish, the portions were small and often had too many flavors going on. May not go back. May be a better place for drinks or for lunch."}
{"text":"I wish I could remember the name of my server because he was phenomenal! 

The food, ambience and service are all great here.

The food is farm to table and the menu has a very wide range of options, with something for everyone. The dishes are mostly small plates meant to be shared amongst the table. All the food as great and I would love to come back to try more. 

There is also an art gallery connected to the restaurant that we walked through afterward. the restaurant itself has great artwork as well."}
{"text":"Had a great burger there with my colleague. Very nice ambiance with an outdoor patio and large open windows that open up fully to connect the outdoor with the inside. The air is very modern. This is for sure a a great place to go."}
{"text":"We ordered Korean ribs (they come on top of the papaya salad), chicken samosas, Marrakech tangia, French fries (well done tho not really!) chicken wings and the Gregoria? pizza. (The prosciutto could have been bigger pieces- just sayin!) 
Everything was so flavorful! The service was awesome and the drinks (Chinese gun pdr tea and I had the something pearl?! It was a sour) were great! One timing glitch that we barely noticed and honestly the manager and server caught it before we did and were super generous. Hip, fun and young we felt like we were in a large and urban city- go Phoenix! 
I'll return and bring friends for sure!"}
{"text":"Great environment and decor.  Food was very good    Artwork in and around the restaurant was awesome.   Our waitress was great and made a great wine recommendation.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We went tonight because we remember the chef Alex Stratta  from the Phoenician , he has simplified the menu and added a wood fired aspect to his repertoire, and what a magical result. We so enjoyed the roasted veggie appetizer and then loved our braised short rib and shrimp with asparagus entreesThe Sicilian cannoli was a perfect finish. Nice wine list, good service and lovely ambiance. I would take 1/2 a star off for the bread that looked like left over sandwich! bread, expect more from such a wonderful chef, but will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Cool gallery/bar/dinner spot- stopped by first night in Phoenix.  Shared excellent Korean BBQ with papaya salad plate and mushroom pizza.  Pizza was good. Portions are lighter.  Came back for a second visit, food was not consistent but still worth the trip."}
{"text":"Great meal in a super hip room. Nice service and a lovely wine list! I had the flat iron steak and my husband had the pork chop. Both were delicious!! 
I totally recommend it!!"}
{"text":"Since they brought in the new chef, this place is quite good. Love the local art on the walls, the valet service makes it easy to park, and the staff is attentive and friendly.

What to order: 
- The Cauliflower-Coconut Fritters are divine. Crispy on the outside, tender and delicious inside. It's like eating the best tempura you've ever had. So good, I'm tempted to just get two orders of them for dinner and forgo anything else.

- Shout out as well to the Grilled Mahi Fish Tacos and the Elote Summer Corn Salad - order them together! You won't regret it. The beautiful crunch and freshness of the corn pairs perfectly with the delectable tacos. My only caveat is the tacos are a touch dry - you can fix this by dousing them in salsa and ordering a few slices of avocado on top. Enjoy!

Issues with the hotel/meeting space:
- Match is located inside the FOUND:RE hotel, and this puts a damper on our view of the restaurant. For some reason, new hotel management has decided not to work with patrons/local business to make their meeting space available unless a minimum of 20 sleeping rooms are also reserved. This makes it impossible to have meetings there for even the largest and most prominent local customers, and will likely land the hotel (and the restaurant) in a problematic relationship with downtown Phoenix. It should also be mentioned that they do not communicate their policies well, or get back to interested parties in a timely manner to discuss these details. A shame overall, as the place has a lot of promise. But an establishment is only as good as its management."}
{"text":"Just stopped by for night snack after long flight and food was really exciting and eclectic!  Really great Poke along with celery root hummus and samosas.  Can't wait to try more of menu!"}
{"text":"This place is look like the new hangout place in the city. The decor is very cool and music is good. The bartenders were very friendly and the place itself have such good vibe.

The cocktail menu was interesting ( we never heard those names before) and  I think it was a bit over price  for Phoenix, $13 a glass on every alcohol mix drink. I had the \" purple rain\" it was good, but my friend ordered \"Hong kong apothecary\" it taste horrible! She had to send it back.

The appetizer was good, we had the Indian samosa it was delicious and the Japanese eggplant deep was ok ( a bit to acidic for my taste)."}
{"text":"Overall, I think that perhaps Match just isn't best suited for larger groups, judging by the better reviews here. Food is alright, service is all over the place. 

We had a reservation for a group of about 15. Mind you, this was on a Friday at 6pm, so it was understandably busy. We do company leader outings here and there, mostly in the Kierland area, and are not a group of picky people by any means, but this experience felt noteworthy.

Seating: 
Half of our reserved area was the living room-style area, and the other half was a long dining table. Other walk in guests were sitting at our table for a good 45 minutes before we were able to sit there. We ended up squeezing all 15 or so of us in to the table, literally sitting hip to hip, since we planned to order dinner as well. Again, great environment for maybe a small group or a couple, but not the best for a larger get-together. Especially when you're trying to eat your dinner off a knee high coffee table. When you reserve, be specific about the area you need for your group.

Service:
Our initial waitress was a very nice woman. The manager also greeted us to apologize for the table being used while our reservations signs were still up. However, another waitress came by to take our drink order roughly 40 minutes after getting the drink menu we had to ask for. She was very irritated with us and everyone else, and made no effort to hide it. Seeing as this was her first interaction with us, I'm not sure why she was so visibly irritated. It took over an hour to get water, which we all found very bizarre. When we told our initial waitress of the other waitress, she told us, and I quote, \"Yeah, she's losing her sh*t.\" We began to joke that maybe this place had just recently opened?

Food:
The food was decent. I'm no food critic by any means, but when you advertise \"Korean BBQ Ribs\" and bring out a salad with 4 medallion sized dry ribs, it leaves one to wonder what's going on. Our Divisional Vice President ordered wings thinking it was a safe bet. 3 seemingly undercooked wings came out. For $10? 3 wings? Luckily she's lighthearted and laughed it off. Someone else ordered a burger and asked if it was the AZ burger. The runner said \"I'm not sure, this is my 3rd day.\" Fair enough - bless her heart. But the better answer would be \"I'm not sure, let me double check for you.\" (It's the only burger on the menu, but neither of them knew that at the time.) The burger was ordered medium, but came out pink all the way to the outside. I ordered the Barrueta Pizza, but received the Spicy Calabrese Pizza. I was told this was what I ordered, so I shut up and ate it. It was actually delicious! I also enjoyed the Jamaican Beef Patties. We kept getting random orders of fries, which nobody should ever complain about. However, I will note that one batch was scalding hot while another was literally chilled. 

Positives: Cool lobby with an interactive projection on the floor. Sweet picture of Tom Selleck? that cracked me up for most of the night. I'm a fan of the food I got, but felt bad for everyone else. Any-gender bathrooms were a very cool thing to see, despite the overflowed trash and lack of paper towels. Sorry Match :("}
{"text":"Almost left, had to wait a while.  Drinks are cool and different.  Food tasted okay, had a pizza that tasted like tortilla and gravy.

Nice atmosphere and decor though.  Servers pour GLASSES of wine from the bottle ... neat  (even if you don't purchase the bottle."}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday evening before the Phoenix symphony performance. The place is clean and orderly, the wait staff and the hostess were welcoming. I was part of an 8 people group and I ordered an old fashioned with makers bourbon, it was well made. As for dinner I ordered a burger medium well and it came out as ordered and was delicious. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Came here for restaurant week in the fall, and I found the atmosphere really cool. It's basically a restaurant attached to an art gallery, lots to look at.

As far as the food goes, I found the dishes well composed and delicious. They also had a solid cocktail menu, and a great beer/wine selection. I would definitely come back. Great place to for dinner with friends or a date!"}
{"text":"Server Amber was helpful and fast dealing with a big party. Never seen anything in Phoenix quite like the cocktail menu-- lots of fresh herbs and Greek alcohols. Since they're relatively new they seem pretty flexible if you try something that's not what you expect. The food menu seems a little more traditional, didn't get any but some friends did and it looked good. 

There's also an art gallery on the other side of the lobby for something to do when you get lost looking for the bathroom."}
{"text":"If you ate at Match anytime during its first year open (2016-2017), you will notice the menu is quite different than when they started out. It's pretty apparent that there was a change in chef, and the menu went from heavily Latin-inspired to an amalgamation of dishes that aren't quite cohesive. 

That being said, the crispy pork belly was expertly prepared, and the cocktails were good. The gnocchi, however, was pretty bland and not al dente. It is a pretty watered down culinary experience from what it used to be."}
{"text":"My experience was so disappointing.  We chose this place because it's new and there were so many positive reviews. We met friends after work on a Friday. Even though the place was mostly empty, they saw fit push tables together to seat a table of  12 right next to us. The sun was going down and shining directly in the faces of half our group through large, unshaded windows.  I found it hard to believe a Phoenix restaurant would shade east facing windows!
The food was pricey and the portions were small. Even though I consider myself somewhat of a foodie, I had to look up several words/ingredients to understand the menu. 
My drink was delicious, Bloom's Negroni Bianco, but it was $11 and there's no happy hour pricing on this beverage."}
{"text":"We were looking for a different experience and a quick meal before attending a Mercury game. Friends recommended this location. We checked out the reviews ahead of time, so we knew what to expect for parking, but got lucky to find street parking on a Saturday night. The Found:Re hotel looks pretty interesting. We really liked the brightness and openness or the bar and restaurant areas, along with the industrial/contemporary, yet comfortable décor. 

I liked that they brought a large corked bottle of cold water for the table - this time of year in Phoenix, it's important to stay hydrated. I ordered an Orchid Spritz - it was good but a little pricey. 

Because they change the menu often (farm to table), my husband was a little disappointed that some items were not available (escargot, pizza), but I was intrigued by the variety of their spring menu. We were so glad we tried the Cauliflower Coconut Fritters. They were done perfectly and were so flavorful. My husband would have liked a little more of the green chili aioli sauce for dipping. I could have made a meal out of these! 

We both were craving a salad, but it didn't appear they offered a side salad, so we split the Caesar salad. It was really unique - fresh greens, crisp cherry tomatoes. It had onions, hard-boiled egg and crunchy croutons. It's always challenging to get a balance of enough but not too much dressing - I felt this one was a little light - I couldn't really get a sense of the flavor of the dressing, but my husband liked it. 

My husband and I ordered the Hamburger and the Flank Steak respectively. Each came with fries (which were perfectly prepared -soft on the inside, crisp on the outside) with your choice of sauces. We got both catsup and garlic aioli. We asked for each to be prepared medium rare - and both were definitely far closer to rare than medium rare. Fortunately the meat was flavorful and good, or we would have asked to have them recook it. So be sure to ask your server to define what medium rare looks like if you are squeamish about under-cooked meat. 

The burger had Swiss cheese and sun-dried tomatoes (yum!) - it came with onions, but my hubby had them put them on the side. My steak was delicious - a bit pricy ($22) for the size - it only looked to be 4-5 ounces. 

Our server was Brittany, and she was great. Just the right blend of attentiveness, information and giving us space to enjoy the meal. Very timely with the check once we let her know we were trying to make the tip-off for the game. 

We most definitely will be back to try their brunch and lunch menus. It will be a great place to meet friends. BTW- the light rail stops just south of the restaurant, so that takes care of the parking issue next trip!"}
{"text":"So went in for my first time tonight and WOW - totally blown away by the entire experience!  Our group got a sampling of about five different dishes as well as dessert and everything was at least above average.  The consensus standout was the chicken samosas, which were perfectly spiced.  In fact, all of the dishes, spicy or not, were incredibly well seasoned and flavorful.  The cocktails were inventive and the wine list, while not extensive, did cover all the critical flavor profiles.  The restaurant itself was a perfect marriage of artistic and classy.  Of special note about tonight: there was a very large birthday party going on (30+ people) and while other restaurants might have been overwhelmed, MATCH did not miss a beat.  The only constructive criticism I would offer would be regarding the bathroom.  Bathrooms are a hallway of unisex stalls with sliding doors.  It's unique approach and would be fine except that the doors don't completely shut and there were a couple of mosquitos in mine (very usual).  Here are the ratings:

Overall, highly recommended and great addition to the Phoenix dining scene."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, pleasant server, Executive Chef Akos Szabo, has a winner for his lobster bisque, and pizza, gentlemen and a scholar, came out and introduced himself and  explained in detail, his ingredients and know how, fabulous food, fabulous chef."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Food executed and presented well. Loved the ambiance and decor. Outside patio was very pleasant. Also had breakfast here before flight and it was great!  They serve wonderful Illy espresso (lattes and cappuccino). Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I was genuinely impressed and will be craving a return trip next time I'm in Phoenix! We stayed at the Found:re Hotel and decided to try MATCH for brunch before checking out. Holy moly was it good!!! When places use fresh, locally sourced products you can definitely tell. 

I had steak and eggs with potatoes, toasty, and a little tomato/arugula/avocado salad. The steak was cooked perfectly, melting in my mouth with a sauce that was lick-your-plate good. My eggs were fluffy and delicious. I'm not a big roasted potatoes fan so I didn't love those, but it's just not my thing. The salad was SOOOOO good, I wanted more! 

My friend had this Sashuksa something-or-other, which was eggs, potatoes, and his choice of toppings baked over stewed tomatoes. So much flavor! He also ordered a side of bacon that was as almost thick as my steak. I could only stomach one bite of it because it was so rich, but delicious. 

My latte was not my favorite but my buddy said the regular coffee was great and loved that they brought him a whole crave so he could refill when needed

The atmosphere was cool, hip, and re:freshing. They have large windows that open up on the side which was wonderful. Plus you could see the kitchen, which I love! 

The only thing we were really bummed about was that we didn't eat here earlier in our trip so we could have multiple visits!! LOL!! 

WILL RETURN FOR SURE!!!"}
{"text":"Swanky and ... okay ... I guess.

I had the Spicy Calabrese pizza for lunch. The crust was crispy on the edges but \"not so much\" in the center. It wasn't soggy, but it could have been more consistent, and sadly the spicy pizza was not spicy. 

The pizza had more flavor than your standard Little Caesars, but not by much. 

It's \"not bad\" pizza."}
{"text":"Celebrated a birthday here (just 2 of us), and they really went out of their way to make it special for us (thank you, Julie!). The GM even personally spoke with me about my plans, which was SUCH a nice gesture; they REALLY want everyone to have a great experience! WHAT SERVICE!! 5-Star in my book (felt like a fine-dining, but without the pretense). Our server, Fernando, was on top of things at all times. One reviewer said MATCH reminded him of a downtown Chicago restaurant, and I concur! I have been a Phoenician way too long, but honestly felt like I was in another city - practically 180° views of trendy Portland Street Park. Didn't experience any noise problems when there.
The cocktails are TDF (To Die For): We had The Aviation, a Match Margarita, and a Sloe Gin drink that were all strong and (after trading sips) were absolutely delicious! Bar staff are very friendly and the Happy Hour prices are a steal!
The food was excellent: fresh flavors, well-seasoned, and cooked to perfection. Not fond of meatballs usually, but their meatball appetizer tasted so uniquely great, they made me a fan (at least of theirs). Besides the meatballs, the truffle fries were ample and very crispy. Had the Sea Bass and the Grilled Shrimp (HUGE!) - both cooked perfectly, served with the yummy sauces recommended by our server (now want to try the others!). Price-wise: not cheap, but comparable to other places nearby (and definitely less expensive than many Scottsdale restaurants in the same \"tier\".)
Also had breakfast there, and was surprised how affordable the breakfast was for what you got. MUCH less expensive and better quality than anywhere I am aware of. And yes, very tasty and fresh, too!
I'll leave you with is: Save room for dessert! Hint: Date Cake"}
{"text":"No complaints. Used a travelzoo offer and got 2 brunch items with a mimosa and/or bloody mary. There are indoor, outdoor and bar seating. Sleek, industrial decor, mirroring the hotels interior design. Lots of cement, metal girder and tile accents.

Got the duck salad and was I surprised at the amount of pleasantly Asian spiced pulled duck was on the well shredded slaw salad. The salad had a variety of finely shredded items, like carrot, bell peppers and radish. The size looked okay, but don't let it fool you, it was filling. It had a light dressing that did not dominate by being too oily or too sweet. Actually just right.

The moroccan chix salad was served warm over bulgar wheat and a luacious but light cream dressing. Refreshingly enjoyably not heat spicy, but a mix of new spice tastes to enjoy. Again, quite filling for the nice size of this plate."}
{"text":"Great food and interesting decor. Parking was a little tricky to figure out, but once we knew you valet at the hotel it was a breeze."}
{"text":"They've  only been open just over a week and I have been there twice. My must haves so far are: the lobster bisque. Silky and rich with the softest most delicious gnocchi in it. Can't wait to go back and get just a side order of gnocchi now. Next is the green papaya salad. Simple and fresh but has tons of flavor. The third is the Bluto which is their chicken sandwich. Sounds ordinary...but it's totally not! They use dark meat which I'm happy about because I'm really not a big fan of chicken breast...so it's very moist. The breading is PERFECTLY crisp without being heavy or hard. And the sauce is sooooo good. I can't even really identify what's in it lol. I just know it's amazing. And the last item is the Escargot. I haven't been abroad...but my sister said it was better than any she had in France...so that's a good sign!  I can't wait to go back and try their breakfast menu"}
{"text":"Dined at this establishment based on a recommendation from a friend. 

Appetizer: The Chickpea Hummus was excellent.  

Dinner: My gf ordered the Braised Short Rib/gnocchi. She stated that it was flavorless and mushy and basically had two bites. Plus the portion was a little on the small side for $24.00.

I ordered the Arugula & Endive Salad and could've done without the \"goat cheese-parmigiano crisp\". 

Dessert: We ordered the slice of cheesecake to share. Good size, however the cheesecake was kind of flaky and crumbly. 

The restaurant itself was very nice. The service was excellent, but because of the food/options (or lack there of), we would not return."}
{"text":"Wanted to love this place as Found:RE is our next staycation spot but both bartenders lacking.  I had the Poke and very good but with no one at bar you'd expect faster more friendly service?"}
{"text":"This place is tasty AF.  We saw this place on Yelp and came during happy hour. We were pleasantly surprised. The Jamaican Patties are like empanadas made with a sweet potato shell and brings a little heat. Drinks were good and service was great. 

Happy hour starts at 4:20!"}
{"text":"For the first time in my 63 years, I sent an entree plate back to the kitchen untouched. It was First Friday and we had been sitting at home all week. So on Thursday, I made a reservation for Match at 6:45 p.m. for Friday for a date night out at someplace new. We arrive and we are seated immediately at a two-top near the center of the room. We immediately notice that it is dark and the music is LOUD...like nightclub dancefloor loud. We also notice that the dining room is only about 30% occupied at the peak hour of a First Friday...hmmm. The music is so loud that we cannot have any conversation between us. The server comes up to the table and is talking to us. I know he is talking because his lips are moving. I think that I hear \"tonight's special...octopus...beans.\" We look at each other and shrug and look the menu over. We order the celery root hummus, two small Match salads and two Plato Paisa entrees which is noted as \"featured steak, chicharron, avocado, fried egg...\" Obviously, it's a take on Bandeja Paisa, a culinary specialty of Columbia. I ask what the \"featured steak\" is and was told \"flat iron.\" Okay, not my favorite cut, but as Match is touted as high-quality cuisine and Plato Paisa is the highest price entree item at $29, I took the chance and ordered it medium-rare; ditto my significant other. As we finished the order, the server asked if we wanted the salads with the entree. I said, \"no, pace this, don't rush the food, appetizer, then salads, then entree.\" The celery root hummus appetizer arrives. As noted in other reviews, it is delicious and the portion is ample. However, it is served with four small/medium pieces of bread (yes, it's Noble Bread bread) and there are long stalks of roasted broccolini laying in it. (What are you supposed to do with the broccolini?) We ate up the four pieces of bread and called the server over. Can we get more bread? Sure was the answer; there's a $2 upcharge. Oh, okay, whatever, sure. He turned from the table and immediately came a runner with the salads. (This is pacing?) The asked-for bread never arrived. Salads were tasty. We were only halfway through when another runner rushed up. The entrees. (This is pacing?) I look down at my plate and think \"where's the beef?\" There's one grayish piece of something smaller than a credit card with a finger-width vein of solid gristle through it. I look across the table at my SO and see that he has thrown his napkin atop his plate and I hear, \"I'm not eating that, it stinks, and where's the steak.\" His portion of flat iron is presented sliced but is as small as my portion. We call the server over. I ask what the portion size of the steak is to be. He says, \"six ounces.\" I say, \"does that look like six ounces?\" He says, \"would you like to talk to my manager?\" I say, \"yes.\" So, the manager arrives at the table. She appears to put on a good act like she cares and is listening. I ask, \"does that look like six ounces?\" and point out the thick vein of gristle. She says no and, seemingly by rote, asks if we would like something else from the menu. Our answer is no, just the check and get us out of here. I pay the check, tip the server generously and we head across Portland to Fez because we still haven't had dinner. Fez is slammed and they are waiting eight deep inside the door because it's First Friday. (hmmm.) I want to emphasize that in 63 years I have never refused an entree plate. I have eaten a wide variety of food in a wide variety of locations in a wide variety of service, everything from stewed goat squatting around an open fire in Kibera to Dinner by Heston Blumenthal in London to street food on the beach in Patong. I have never ever refused a service...until Match on this past Friday. The entrees were not on our bill, points for that, but ultimately my opinion is that the people at the top of this restaurant don't care and don't get it."}
{"text":"Came to try happy hour menu.  Ordered the Frites ($4.20) and Jamaican patties  ($6.20).  Fries were soggy,  and I ate around a handful,  or seven and bartender had asked earlier how I found them- \"ok,\" I said.  \"Just ok?\"  \"They're too soggy.\"  He came around again,  and I'd already stopped eating them by that time.  He looked at me, then at the frites, and then looked at me again, and I said they were too soggy to enjoy.  He lifted and felt around three of them and agreed they \"shouldn't be that soggy\" and offered to get something else prepared for me.  I said it's alright,  I don't want to impose,  and he said he wouldn't mind getting something else made,  so we discussed a few options, and I went with the Green beans with crispy pork belly.  He asked if I wanted to keep the frites.  (Umm, no.  You touched a few of them!  I thought these words, but didn't say them out loud.)  \"No, it's ok. You can take them away.\"

While I waited for the green beans, the Jamaican patties arrived.  Two pieces for $6.20.  Glad I tried these during hh, because regular price is $10!  They were tasty and empanada-style-- the habanero kick was pleasing, but they were very pricey for the portion size.  The green beans arrived, and they were good, albeit very salty.  The crispy pork belly was a nice touch, but added even MORE salt to the already salty and greasy beans.

Wasn't impressed so far- had to skip on alcoholic beverages due to being on antibiotics- and then I received my bill... The cost of the frites was deducted,  and I was charged $6.20 each for the patties and the beans.  What??  I didn't speak up, I just paid and left a 20% tip (too much, I know).  Hey, other places would have either deducted the frites charge and not charge me for the beans, or at the very least left the lesser charge to cover the beans.  I wonder, if I was silly enough to keep the contaminated frites, would I have been charged for those, too?  

Was looking forward to a great visit, with so many friends writing about their lovely experiences here.   (Maybe brunch time is better? ) Too bad, because the atmosphere of this boutique hotel and bar seemed nice.  :("}
{"text":"Excellent service! Every employee is attentive from the valet guys to front of house.. Hostess Kaya is the best.. love the open feeling of this place and the food is amazing.."}
{"text":"This place is very very good. You would almost not know it's there! It is tucked off to the side of a hotel entrance. The hotel (whose name I never got) is a private industrial style artsy boutique hotel. That's another review. The resto has amazing service. We waited at the bar where we had duck spring rolls and drinks while waiting for our dinner partners. The bar was cool service great and the spring rolls are great. We gout our table for 6 on the patio near the fire pit. Really nice. Food was great. Salmon and sea bass were very good although slightly small potions for the price.   Everyone enjoyed dinner and the service was great. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! Low key place to relax get excellent food and fantastic service. Shout out to Amy our server. Was the best service we've had anywhere in quite some time. Definitely will be back. 

Strongly recommend to anyone that's looking for a new place for brunch."}
{"text":"I just loved eating here. I think that just about everything on the menu was locally sourced, which I like. It's good to know that all of your food is as fresh as it can be. The service was on point, and the chef even came out to check to make sure we were pleased with our selections. If you are considering eating here, I give it a hard \"yes\". Just give it a shot - aside from the food, the atmosphere is perfect. This would be a good place to take a date, or to dine with friends and family."}
{"text":"Great place for an informal dinner, visiting old friends here in Phoenix.  Wine list is excellent (if expensive); atmosphere is conducive to conversation and leisurely evening (not many people eating downtown on a Thursday night).  Unlike some of the other reviews, our service was excellent (sorry I don't remember her name), well informed about the menu.  Chef's choice charcuterie for appetizer was generous and tasty;  short ribs and sea scallops excellent in both presentation and flavor.    A little pricey, but worth it."}
{"text":"Birthday Dinner at the Chef's Table.  Chef Matt prepared and served his delectable creations in our 7 course meal. Yummy.  We'll definitely be back for more! Thank you to our sweet friend's  recommendation.  
When I have experienced something amazing like a dinner here,  I must share with the world! 

Our server Lauren was just so attentive and knowledgeable with each wine pairing. 

Let my pictures convince you of how yummy the food is.  Well the pictures don't do it justice."}
{"text":"The space is really interesting! There's a gallery that is on the ground floor of the hotel that wraps into the restaurant. The atmosphere is fun and hip. The food portions were incredibly small -- we got the cous cous with salmon and had to order additional food. we also got a salad with tuna - the tuna was SUPER salty, making the last pieces inedible. its certainly a cool room, but the food is struggling."}
{"text":"After strong recommendation, my wife and I patronized this establishment on a Friday night.   Word to the wise.  Do not leave without trying the Lobster Bisque or Celery Hummus.  

My compliments to the executive chef and staff.   There wasn't an average thing on the menu.  Match instantly moved into my Top 5 of Phoenix, arguably in my Top 3.

Great atmosphere and great staff.   I plan on spending a lot of time here in 2017 and beyond"}
{"text":"I went in expecting something a little more romantic. It was very hip and trendy looking, But very loud with chatter . Very loud. The menu was not very extensive I had a hard time choosing something I wanted to eat. There were alot of unique items. Lobster bisque was good but had a weird taste, I couldnt put my finger on what it was.  Everything else was just ok not delicious"}
{"text":"On my third trip here, and it's consistently awesome: unusual menu items, well-prepared, with courteous and helpful staff, in an environment that's energetic without being insanely loud.

I get here on the light rail, so I've never had to deal the peculiar parking procedures around Portland Park. I also eat here in the morning or pre-dinner afternoon, as my desire to deal with dinner crushes is zero (and the brunch menu is enough to keep me busy for weeks).

It's a short menu, which works for me because everything sounds good, so I'm only forced to make heartbreaking choices among 7-8 items instead of picking through 30. So far, I've had a beautifully prepared Benedict, very rich and delicious hazelnut toast with nectarines, and a burger that was good but honestly swamped in my memory by this amazing dessert that was sort of pudding with delicious debris floating in it.

My preference is to eat at the bar, where I can ask the bartender stupid questions like \"how do you spell the wifi password?\" This also means I'll get told more about why the wine I ordered is good, which is fine with me.

Really, I'd like exactly 34.52% of my life to involve a lifestyle where I just came here for every meal."}
{"text":"Service was great. The food was better than average. Loved their shrimp appetizer and crab BLT. Salmon was a little small and the veggies slightly over cooked."}
{"text":"I went to Match for their Thanksgiving dinner with a friend. We had a reservation for 6pm. The dinner supposed to be provided was a 3 course meal starting off with butternut squash soup. The soup was okay, nothing out of the ordinary. For the main course the menu said turkey with a cranberry sauce, brussel sprouts, stuffing, and mashed potatoes. Our plates showed up with turkey with gravy and green beans instead of brussel sprouts, with a weird stuffing that resembled a quinoa salad, salty mashed potatoes, and no cranberry sauce. It was 6pm and they had already run out of brussel sprouts AND cranberry sauce! Soon after that I could overhear them telling other guests that they had ran out of mashed potatoes. How to you put on a Thanksgiving meal and start running out of items listed on the menu at 6pm?! The only decent thing food wise was the pumpkin pie with a marshmallow type topping. My friend and I were both highly disappointed with the food for the price. The one good thing about our visit was the waitstaff, they were great. I felt bad for them as they were the face of the failure and caught all the backlash from customers due to poor planning."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Extremely underwhelmed. Went last night with 3 friends. We wanted patio and they sat us at an 8 top, high top, the only one outside. Awkward. Weird. Service was slow and with unnecessary attitude. Hipster servers who don't give AF. I spent $50 on 2 cocktails and some over cooked meatballs. So not worth it. Cocktails are trying to be fancy but not hitting the mark at all. Meatballs were bland. Tried a friends green beans. Overcooked. Mushy. Don't bother. Cool only on the outside."}
{"text":"Not good. Lots of empty tables & hostess says 15 to 30 minute wait. So we sat at the bar and a waitstaff comes and says I'm sorry but I won't be able to take your drink orders until after I take care of the restaurant orders. Really?!!?!?! Not enough staff... Never going back. Never ever again!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately the food at Match Restaurant does not match the restaurant's cool and interesting decor.  The food is pretentious at best.  We had a Caesar salad which had very little resemblance to a real Caesar, and sadly, not even half as tasty.  The salmon fillet that accompanied this salad seemed to have been deep fried, or else it was cooked to within an inch of its life, dry and leathery.  The Manhattan drink was a mystery to us...why call a drink a Manhattan or a salad a Caesar when you're making something else?  It wouldn't have been so bad if everything wasn't so ridiculously expensive."}
{"text":"Nick and I came here before going to see the Nutcraker. Everyone seemed very eager to help us as soon as we walked in. We decided to sit at the bar...because well we're bar people. The interior of the restaurant is pretty dark and industrial, but all the artwork really brings it to life. They also have a great communal seating area right by their gallery that would be great to use for an event.

We came during happy hour, but decided to peruse both menus. Their craft cocktails were only $6 on HH...great deal. I ordered the Alpaca to start. It had Fernet, Coke, and mint. It had a great bitter taste that made it a wonderful digestif before our meal. For my second cocktail I had the Peruvian Pearls. It's their take on a Pisco sour. Their sour mix is homemade with egg whites, which I love. They balanced the tartness well by adding coconut to it. We could tell our bartender was dedicated to his craft, but he was still very personable and funny. 

We ordered the Chicken Samosas, Poke bowl, and Gnocchi and Meatballs. One thing I love about their menu is that it is truly a multicultural experience. They are a melting pot with Mediterranean, Asian, and Italian dishes (just to name a few). The Samosas had a great flaky crust and delicious, spicy filling, and the Poke bowl had some great acidity. They added vinegar to their rice, and pickles to the bowl which gave it a nice zip. My favorite was definitely the meatballs though. I'm trying to put my finger on why it was so outstanding. I just think the quality and temperature of the meat was superb.

Great upscale spot to impress out of towners, or your partner without breaking the bank. Beautiful experience on all fronts!"}
{"text":"We are locals who like to support downtown businesses.  We finally made it to the Hotel as quite frankly we assumed it was opening this summer. Even recently when we dined at Fez, we missed this.  Our Bad! 

So we came in Friday to check out Match and were greeted by Ann.  She is a wonderful Ambassador for your Brand and gave us the whole art tour as it was off hours for Match. That and a great thumbnail overview of the menu offerings. A very genuine person.

Today we returned and in the parking lot we were greeted by Jerome who could not have been more accommodating for several reasons.  He should be acknowledged. By the time we departed he was no longer on site, otherwise we we had planned to acknowledge him.

Once inside Match, it was like the air had been let out of the Staff and there was no greet so we sat our selves.  We believe the restaurant wants to be high end, yet it is not yet quite there.

Will not detail the utter disappointment in the experience, save for Match's Director of F&B, Brian Blanke, who caught wind of the less than stellar experience and absence of TLC while we attempted to dine.

 He, too, could not have been more genuine.  He was truly dismayed by what did not happen for us and showed it. 

So we are no longer dismayed and will be returning soon, as places like the FoundRE & Match in Phx are far, far and few between."}
{"text":"I figured, \"Ooo fancy restaurant, their steak must be great.\" Nope. Maybe the plus side of how tiny the steak is, is that it's very chewy, so it technically lasts longer? I'm usually one to friendly offer a face slap when someone orders steak sauce for food already specially seasoned to where it should be, but even with Match's own sauce added, this piece of meat was still in need of flavor."}
{"text":"What can we say....AMAZING! Food, drink, waiting staff, thank you Jessica, chefs, unbelievable. We sat at the chef's counter facing the kitchen and watched and learned the entire meal. Also were treated to many dishes thanks to Chef Vincent! Woodfire burger, flat bread, chicken wings, duck spring rolls, homemade cannolis, jut fantastic! Make sure to sit at the chefs counter as it's the only way to go!"}
{"text":"Food was reasonable at typical hotel mark ups. Hostess was great, server very poor. Watching server taste her meal in open kitchen then head in back to eat it was completely unprofessional given she made zero attempt to inform us she was going on break. Made to wait far too long after finishing meal. Very close to telling host room to charge for cost of meal with zero tip."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!  I only gave it two stars because the art gallery within is amazing.  I give that five stars.  The bar-0 stars.  

No one noticed us as we came in and around the bar to sit.  Minutes went by and after one of the bartenders helped the couple that came in after us, I finally asked the bar back for a drink menu.  A few more minutes went by and then bar back asked if we had been helped.  We hadn't so he called someone over to take our drink order.

This bartender was so slow, talking to one of the patrons while making our two drinks.  It was three or four minutes in between drinks and he served my husband first.  My drink isn't horrible, but tastes like a store bought mix of the drink I ordered.  I did see him make it, it's just not great.  

At one point there were seven workers in and around the bar, it's not even busy and we didn't get helped.  

This is slightly farther away than Old Town, now I know why we go there for drinks.  The drinks and service are impeccable on Old Town food r the same prices.  

Don't waste your time at Match."}
{"text":"I had an amazing experience at the bar at Match.  We had a beautiful view of downtown. The windows are huge, so its like everything is outside. I had a bunch of happy hour food it was very good. Go with the korean ribs for real. The menu has all kinds of stuff. My new favorite place"}
{"text":"I ate here last night for the first time with a group of about 10 for my birthday. The restaurant is really beautiful and unique. The food was INCREDIBLE. Seriously so delicious. The cocktails are also equally wonderful. I will say the service was slow; we ordered off the restaurant week menu so it was 3 courses and we ended up being there close to 3 hours so I wouldn't recommend this spot for a \"quick\" bite. I would recommend it in every other capacity, however! And slow isn't bad-- must not confuse the two. Our server was very friendly and I felt he was genuinely excited to make my birthday dinner special. I will be back, I will tell my friends and I hope to see this place thrive."}
{"text":"3.5 but I'll round up for making the waiter run around asking questions for us. 
I wanted to try this place out since I heard about it being street food centric in an article on AZcentral. We were downtown so we thought we give it a try. I heard interesting things about parking there so we just decided to walk instead..also we already paid for the whole day in the garage and didn't want to leave ¯\_(?)_/¯. The atmosphere is pretty cool, if you have to wait for a table you can take a stroll in the lobby and look at the art.
And now to the food. We ordered the lobster bisque, indian butter chicken somosas, AZ burger, Gregorio pizza, and grateful shroom pizza, all paired with a nice riesling. I know not all of this is considered \"street food,\" but due to the sharing nature compromises had to be made. Starting of with the lobster bisque, a small cup was enough for 3 of us to have a good tasting. The waitress told us the broth takes 3 days to make and I believe her. The bisque was very rich and flavorful and included hearty chunks of lobsters and gnocchis. The samosas were  another hit of the night, with nice flaky crust and moist and flavorful chicken (with a kick) paired with a cooling cucumber raita. I'm not usually a person that orders a burger when there are other more exotic choices on the menu, but surprises come where you least expect. The surprise here was the pickles...you heard right the pickles! They were so good we had to order more (its $1.50 for extra pickles) and ask the waitress what kind they were and where to get them. And you thought I was gonna rave about the actual burger. The burger was meh at most...meat was fine and the tomato and pickles add nice texture and flavor that it lacks. The homeboy's habanero spread would have saved it, but was seriously overpowered by the red fife wheat roll and you couldn't taste anything but the crumbly hard crusted roll. The pizzas were nothing really to talk about either, I was very disappointed in the Gregorio. It was supposed to have mascarpone and fig but all we tasted was salt. 
Overall a very interesting place to come with a group of friends and try new things (the pickles). Will definitely be back to try some more of the \"street food\" dishes."}
{"text":"A friend brought me here for lunch soon after they opened. She was singing their praises and I was not disappointed. A great new destination right on Central in the Arts District of Phoenix.

My lunch (French Onion soup and some great bread) was just perfect. We shared a dessert. Rich and chocolaty!  Our server (Janine) couldn't have been friendlier or more on top of our needs. Just loved my first experience at Match.

I was so pleased with that 1st experience that we planned a surprise get-together here with a few friends. Service was outstanding! Although we weren't the only guests in the bar area, we were treated as if we were. Our Server (Maxwell) was super friendly and very knowledgeable about the bar/restaurant, hotel history, local sourced ingredients for both food and drinks . . . and he spent time answering all the questions we had about the new hotel. We never felt rushed or lacking of service. We ordered multiple appetizers (all were great - thanks chef!) and lots of desserts. These were so outstanding that we asked to talk to the Pastry Chef - she came out and gave us details of every dessert we tried. What fun!

There is Interesting local art on all the walls - including a couple of galleries devoted to rotating art exhibits. Be sure to check out the tech art piece in the floor of the front lobby. Not to be missed. 

This new hotel (Found:Re) and its restaurant (Match) is the cat's meow! If you are local or just in town visiting, be sure to visit this great new spot."}
{"text":"Okay! So I rarely rate a place 5 stars unless I am completely obsd with it! And MATCH deserves all five stars hands down! I came here just for drinks with my bf, we were able to sit outside on the patio but it was still connected all inside. I loved the location of this and how it was facing the downtown streets. All the variety of seating here is so unique! It had the best vibes all around! You're also welcome to explore the hotel which is connected to the restaurant if you'd like, which ofc we did! Even the bathrooms were unique! There were interesting paintings that are relevant to today's day and age which I found the most cool to look at! Now we tried two drinks, one being the mule cocktail, which was TO DIE for it included ginger beer which I found so so tasty!! I also had the pearfect margarita which was more strong but still just so good! Paid about $30 for two drinks..little pricy I suppose but given a good night and the ambiance of this place I would pay that all over! My server I believe was James, who shared some interesting stories with us and treated us so kindly, checking up on us often! I even would request for James when I do come back! Lovely place! Alrdy one of my favorites!! I'll be recommending here to lots of people! This is for sure a place i will come back to often for drinks! Can't wait to come back!!((:"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, very cool art.  The cocktails were amazing! And I tried damn near every single one on the menu! Lol 
Got some of the tapas. The Moroccan meatballs were sooooo delish!! The wings and the Indian butter chicken samosas were good but didn't knock my socks off. Also had the lobster bisque..it was delicious! The pizza was good too! One thing I was not a fan of is their paper straws...I get it, you're trying to be green and save the planet, but drinking out of a paper straw sucks."}
{"text":"I wish I could give a better review, and when the restaurant opened it seemed like it had so much potential, but the last several times I've been there I've been disappointed, so much so I won't go back.

The last time was on a Sunday morning to have brunch. We were told that the restaurant wasn't ready to begin seating and it was recommended we wait at the bar. Moving to the bar, we'd just sat down when we were told the bar couldn't take our orders, anyone's orders, because the only server had to seat and serve a big group of people who came in after us who had been part of a yoga group at the pool. 

We were there 10 minutes before they even began to wander in. The restaurant and hotel knew that there was a great chance that there would be a number of people eating, yet they only scheduled one server for the restaurant and bar? And then they rebuffed the first group to arrive?

The menu has gotten boring, they've gone through multiple chefs, and they don't appear to appreciate their clientele. 

I'd recommend going anywhere else."}
{"text":"My friend and I discovered Match on Yelp and went there for lunch. It was AMAZING!  This completely renovated former Best Western in now FOUND:RE hotel, art gallery, restaurant and lounge.  The restaurant is chic industrial design. All of the building that we saw is gorgeous, very modern and fun. All of the windows in the restaurant slide open to let in the great weather and there is great outdoor seating on both sides, one side being a pool.  Inside next to the bar is a large comfy seating/conversation area.   The hostess and the waitress (Hey, Missy!) were just lovely.  The food!! I had a wild mushroom flatbread and it was out of this world.  My friend had a luscious kale salad. We both enjoyed an Arizona wine, Provisioner White.  We told the hostess how much we liked the food and the next thing you know the owner of the hotel and the Chef, Alex Stratta, bring out samples of other flat breads which were all completely delicious! Chef Alex chatted with us. He was very charming.   This place has got it going on all over the place.  DO NOT MISS IT!"}
{"text":"Food was decent.  Nothing to brag about. The drinks were different. Extremely over priced for what they were. 
Atmosphere is pleasant. It's right across the street from fez. 
I will not be going back due to value for goods. 4 drinks. A small pizza and salad was $90.  That's a ridiculous price for what was purchased."}
{"text":"Sloooowest service ever. We came in on a Monday night and it wasn't too busy but it still took forever. The whole night was slow. Getting our checks took over 30mins. 

Food was alright. It wasn't fantastic. The hummus was my favorite thing we ordered. Definitely small portions for the price. 

The atmosphere and aesthetic of this place is top notch, but the food is meh."}
{"text":"Nice loungie bar with a view of the grassy island. The bar is open to the outdoor weather. With the fire pits in patio, it feels toasty. My favorite dish is the wings but I haven't had it since the new chef took over. On this night, I had the duck spring rolls, which are egg rolls. They with pear watercress salad and raisin pine nut sauce. If the spring rolls had ginger, they would taste good on its own. The tiramisu came in a bowl. It doesn't look appealing but was yummy."}
{"text":"Great hotel but they really need some bartenders... A guy could get sober in here!!!.............."}
{"text":"Up until tonight, this place was maddening. When we first went, it was good, but not great. Then...almost inexplicably, it started to get worse. This was with a new chef, and we were stunned. How could a place that has these great ideas just fall flat? The kale salad was bitter and underprepared, and the short rib  was just...meh. On the other hand, breakfasts kept getting better. We just couldn't figure it out. Tonight, at a First Friday, we FINALLY got the whole package. Every dish was a delight (the hummus wonderful, the tiramisu nearly perfect, and the drinks were all flavorful and different). What really put us over the top was the service. Toby and Justin treated us like friends--with respect and a friendly face. Kudos to finally hitting the right notes. We'll be back very, very soon."}
{"text":"Initially when we walked in, the restaurant was dead but everyone was standing around talking. It took a few minutes to be acknowledged, which was by the hostess after she was off the phone. But there were servers and bartenders who just were chatting at the bar. We sat on the patio. The structure is amazing, lots of steel! The inside decor is unique showcasing bottles of wine and eccentric paintings.  We got the cosmo and Moscow mule. Both were tasty and quite strong (not complaining). We got the hummus, veggie skewers and flatbread pizza. The pizza was a little soggy, nothing to write home about. The veggies skewers were Ahhhmazing! The pesto sauce seriously so so good! The hummus was interesting! Lots of mixture of veggies but again very tasty! We rode our bikes and I wish there was more bike parking nearby. There was only bike parking at fez and the racks were crowded."}
{"text":"I feel really \"meh\" about this place... It was okay, but I definitely had higher expectations. We went last night at 6 for happy hour. It says on their website they have HH until 7, but they recently changed it to 6. They were accommodating and still have us HH prices, but I hate when places change policies and don't update their website. It feels awkward and cheap to ask for the deal. Anyways! I am a huge IPA fan and they had 2 decent ipas on their draft list. They were out of both (what?) so I ordered a bottle. Fine, I guess, but how can you not have any ipas on tap?? We ordered 2 appetizers- the vegetable skewers and the chicken wings. Both were mediocre. The patio is beautiful; has warmers and is really comfortable, but it was dead for a Friday night. I like a place with more of a buzz. The service was excellent, but besides that the place is nothing really special..."}
{"text":"Went to match for brunch yesterday. Very disappointing overall. Amateur operation based on one visit, maybe will give another chance for dinner. 

Big WOW factor visually with a stunningly decorated lobby, numerous artworks (yes, the naked Burt Reynolds piece behind the reservations desk is particularly fun). 

Look someone has obviously poured some mega cash in the stunning interior decor, hip lighting, modern aesthetic etc. This is a big cavernous place. 

But the food and service for Brunch at around 1pm yesterday was so utterly ordinary. 

Our overly friendly waiter was nice - but really too much. After taking our order for 6 people it took almost 20+ minutes for any food to appear. It was brought by a young kid in dark sunglasses (no prob, food runner we assumed). My frittata was overcooked and just tasted meh. Everyone else agreed the food wasn't bad - but it wasn't exquisite either. 

Then our original waiter popped by (nice guy). \"Sorry I left you and it took so long, but I had to help a lady upstairs to her room with her luggage so I was delayed!\"

Luggage? Hmmm this was weird. Since when is a waiter in a fine restaurant running luggage? Weird. 

He offered me refills on my grapefruit juice 4 times. Even offering to make me one to go. 
 
Then things got even kookier.  10 min later we hear yelling coming from the kitchen. Very loud. We just all looked at each other. Suddenly a man we had never seen popped over to our table and said he apologized for \"what happened.\"  

\"Gee what happened?\" I asked. 

\"Um nothing. Thanks.\" Said the man as he quickly dashed away.  

Huh??? Well why come over in the first place? Weird. 

So let me surmise: this is not at the Brunch quality of my fave restaurant \"Fame\" just north on Central. Fame kicks the \"trying too hard\" fancy schmancy pseudo-hipster Match to the curb. 

Match seems all Warhol styled glitter and very little under the airbrushed exterior. Those raving reviews so far on YELP are likely not an indication of some incredible new place. 

Match also has problems with staff. If a waiter is hauling luggage, then something is desperately wrong. Avoid. Not impressed."}
{"text":"The food there was excellent as was the environment. Felt as though I were in San Francisco or somewhere a lot more trendy than Downtown Phoenix. I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich and the fries and both were EXCELLENT. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The good news is that Match is not the stereotypical hotel dining room type of restaurant. You know, those places that charge 5-star prices but make you wish you decided to go to McDonald's instead? What Match has going for it is a sparse but interesting menu that looks and tastes good and is surprisingly reasonably prices considering the hotel it's in is walking distance to exactly only one other restaurant (Fez across the street).  So having a captive audience does that mean they have to try harder or not try as much?

I ate there twice, once for dinner on a Saturday night and again for brunch on Sunday morning.  We were staying at the hotel (a staycation - reviewed separately) and purposely chose to eat at Match despite having plans to go downtown for an event later that evening.

Match is relatively casual and informal with pretensions that it's \"all that\".  They breathlessly advise you to make reservations because they tout themselves as the \"busiest restaurant in Phoenix\" or something like that.  Well at about 7 PM on a Saturday night the place was about 70% empty. Yet the pretension continued when we walked up to the desk without reservations and got that \"OH! You don't have reservations. I'll see if we can find a table for you\". HUH?  What about all those empty ones over there?  Whatever.

So they \"found\" us a table. I had chicken because I had a taste for it. It was basically the piece of meat with some stuff scattered around it. It was a dichotomy - dry and tough but really tasty.  KFC won't have to worry about the competition. My dining companion had a Cobb salad that was pretty big and loaded. We both had a chilled avocado/melon soup that was remarkably good.

The next morning we both had Salmon Benedict. It wasn't bad (I mean how bad can you screw up poached eggs over an English muffin?).  The poached eggs were kinda bizarre though, big white puffy perfectly round mounds ... two of them, like Hostess Sno Balls. They were just too perfect looking, like they were mass produced.  The salmon (lox) wasn't the most flavorful but it was okay. But for whatever reason the eggs were served on the same plate as a green side salad with Italian dressing on it.  Weird.

What keeps Match from being outstanding are the people who work there. After being open for 10 months they still seemed to be dazed and confused like it was opening day, either not knowing or not caring what they were serving. For example the server asking what style of eggs I want for the Eggs Benedict ... um, sweetie, if the eggs aren't poached it's not really a Benedict, is it?

The nail in the coffin was the \"open\" kitchen, which must have sounded to the owners like a great idea. But not when you can hear the chefs arguing about how much to \"upcharge\" a customer for a substitution. Cringeworthy!  They seriously need a manager on duty to whip this staff into shape."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I decided to have dinner at match Saturday night prior going to the comedy show downtown. It turned out to be an incredibly good choice. The duck roll appetizers and vegetable skewers were oh so spectacular. We both ordered the salmon for a main course and it was even better than the appetizers. The wait staff was very prompt and attentive to our needs and wants. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"MATCH. Serves. Brunch!! MATCH, newly opened this past October, is now serving brunch by popular demand, and just started this past January. I cruised in with my friends and was excited to try this night spot transformed into day spot. 
The ambience of Match is still the same, it's trendy with colorful art littering the walls, and a sleek, simple but balanced, darker aesthetic complimented by big airy windows. It's not summer yet in Phoenix, so why not sit by the window? We definitely did.
The brunch has a $27 deal that includes a bottle of champagne and OJ each- our waitress said it comes out to 5-6 drinks depending! Not bad for brunch! While we passed on this, we gladly ordered some Bloody Mary's made from their own special house mix and lattes by local Press Coffee. The fresh-pressed juices by Karma Juice also looked delicious, but many of them were sadly sold out when we were there. Overall, their beverage game was on point!
Our server, Amy, was friendly and delightful, warning us that the quiches were so popular that there were only two left! Well, we obviously had to rescue them. So we ordered the last two \"Don't Quiche Me on the Mouth\" quiches and the Filipino Chile Relleno. 
I am Filipino, and I always tell those who are not used to Filipino food, that the cuisine is an acquired taste. I was skeptical to try a childhood favorite with a twist- longanisa (Filipino breakfast sausage), but when I tried it, I think my childhood self yipped in joy! I would never ever have the guts to put a twist on a Filipino staple, especially because my mom would probably disown me if I did, and I have tasted many 'Filipino dishes with a twist' that have failed my taste test- but the dish had a spicy kick, and mixed with the cotija cheese, it was perfect. My best friend, who is also Filipino, took a bite and his eyes rolled in the back of his head! Safe to say- this dish is Filipino approved! 
The quiches also tasted delicious were two inch high in thickness, stuffed with natural ingredients. Thumbelina could have lived in there and been good for life. By the time we were done with our entrees we were stuffed, but split the Oaxacan Wreckage for desert. When it came out, it looked so beautiful I didn't want to destroy it with my fork. The almond crumble was a perfect edition to the mole mousse. I will warn that this is not for the faint of heart or the diabetic- if you have a sweet tooth and are craving chocolate, this will definitely hit the spot. 
All in all, I was impressed by the diverse menu. The Filipino Chile Relleno is creative and brings Filipino culture to Phoenix- something I can say I am very happy about, but it is not the only dish there exhibiting culinary creativity. The staff was also super amiable, and I can't wait to come back- day or night!"}
{"text":"This is the third time we've eaten here. The first 2 weren't the best experiences. It seemed the menus are trying so hard to be something very fancy. Sustainable Salmon for example, or cocktails that literally taste like dirt - not my words - this came from everyone who tried it at the table. I LOVE the space. And the staff is incredible. But the food left us wanting something a little more simple. It's so hard to describe. It's just like they're trying way too hard. In addition 2 friends that had the hamburger one night in January both got the same food poisoning which laid them out for 10 days - during a trip we all had to Costa Rica. Not cool.

But fast forward to last night. A big group of us took up 3 of their largest tables and had a blast. I stuck to rum & cokes which was perfect. No menu drinks for me anymore. And we ordered the Korean Short Ribs and the Poke Bowl for apps. These were fantastic! Then for dinner we had the Pork Chop and Steak Frittes. Again, everything was so good! Even our friend that had previously been given food poisoning was next to me. He got the Gregorio Pizza and it all turned out great.

In addition, we had the pleasure of Lauren taking care of us. She was on top of this group the entire night. She's funny, super helpful, and knew what each of us wanted before WE did. I never once had to order another drink. One was just always there. It was a perfect night. I'm so glad that we kept finding our way back here, because with this space I really wanted to love this restaurant. Nice job!"}
{"text":"Five stars all the way. Chefs Alex Stratta (from Alex at the Wynn) and Patrick Fegan are true masters of their craft. Everything from the appetizers (spicy eggplant dip and duck spring rolls) to the entrees (braised short ribs and garlic shrimp agnolotti) were explosive in flavors. Presentation was absolutely divine and we absolutely enjoyed every bite.

Despite his celebrity status, Chef Alex has remained humble and approachable throughout his years and tenure at some of the country's and state's finest restaurants. It is truly a pleasure to have tasted his cuisine here at Match for the first time. Thank you for a most memorable evening. Match will most probably become my new favorite restaurant in town. Thank you Chef Patrick for your visit to our table and to Tora for the outstanding service. You have truly created a gem for which you should be really proud of."}
{"text":"Had very high expectations and this place delivered at every turn. The bartenders do not just mechanically run through the motions here, they actually understand the art of mixology and have a deep appreciation for cocktails. I learned a lot."}
{"text":"What would you expect from a wannabe upscale fancy place in a hotel. 

How about a $50 breakfast for two. Bacon and eggs is literally 1 piece of bacon and a side of two pieces will cost you $6. 

The appetizers tasted good, wings, samosas, and lobster bisque. The lobster bisque was a family recipe that tasted like a dirty, sweet soup with butter and lobster more than a lobster bisque. 

And don't get me started on the funky beer and liquor selection. I get you want to be hip and different but you lost our business to Fez across the street which had better everything for less. 

Service was good and friendly so I'll give them that, but not worth going back for."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying the food was solidly ok. Everything else was not. The service was absolutely abysmal despite the restaurant being mostly empty.  70 dollars poorly spent on incorrect orders, zero water refills, and lackluster service. We will not be back."}
{"text":"There's no sign outside with the restaurant's name, which made finding it super challenging: I made 3 circles around the block until I found a little sign for the restaurant's parking area.  There's also no sign once you go into the building pointing toward the restaurant. 
There was a hair in my food so I sent it back.  Despite this unpleasant episode they charged full price for it.  The food was mediocre at best.
The bathrooms are strange & tiny.
Don't recommend this place - wasn't impressed with it on any level, and it just doesn't seem to be worth the time & money."}
{"text":"For $33 my roommate and I split the contemporary American cuisine for restaurant week. Appetizer we got was the potato gnocchi with wild mushrooms which was AMAZING. You need to try it!! I would die for that dish 
The main course was the sea bass which was substituted into the menu. Also delicious. Not as good as the appetizer. 
Dessert was coconut and passion fruit tapioca!! First off the texture... wow. Taste... wow!! 
If you like light but flavourful meals you should split it. So cheap and honestly perfectly portioned for two. 
We have been here plenty of times before. The hotel lobby is beautiful, and there's local art everywhere!! 
Service this time was a bit slow this time for literally everything, our water and our beer/wine... but our waiter was sweet and brought out two desserts at the end. 
All in all another great experience at Match."}
{"text":"So many things to say about my wonderful experience.

The atmosphere is incredible. Artistic, beautiful, sleek, relaxed, and enjoyable.  We were a group of about ten women and we had a wonderful time. We felt comfortable enough to stay for a few hours and enjoy our time.   When you look at the menu, you can see that the purpose of the restaurant is more than just serving food and drinks. I can't imagine the thought, skill, and creativity that went in to each cocktail and food item.  Everything we ordered was delicious and felt like a personal experience rather than just eating and drinking.  Each item was unique and included authentic ingredients.  I spent time living in Japan, and a lot of the restaurants there create a food experience that encourages its customers to enjoy every bite.  This restaurant gave me that same experience, and I was so thankful. We tend to just shovel food in here in America, without much thought or consideration to the flavor of each bite.   

The service here is phenomenal.  The staff was attentive, friendly, and personable. Through our entire dining experience, the service was warm and friendly. My friend had been to Match the night before and mentioned to the staff that she was planning on having her birthday dinner there the next night.  At the end of our meal the staff surprised her with a beautiful handmade cake!!! And it was SO good. One of the best cakes I've ever had.     

I'm thankful to have found such a great place. I can't wait to try more of the unique items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Didn't love it... the space is beautiful, trendy, and chic but the food didn't hit the spot for me.  I had the lobster bisque which for me was too rich and earthy and lacked what you'd expect, the hint or taste of lobster. The wood fired gnocchi and mushrooms completely ruled this dish and not in a good way.  

For the entree I tried one of their specials, a sous vide bone in pork chop over a bed of pineapple infused rice. The presentation was beautiful but the pork on its own, while very tender, lacked seasoning and flavor.  The rice with small chunks of pineapple and a house made pineapple vinegarette was decent but didn't knock my socks off.  It looked a lot better than it tasted honestly.  

We tried a couple of the pizza's as well and they were just OK. 

The service was good, except that we asked for the the check and they brought it with my plate of food still sitting in front of me, we hung out for about 20 minutes after to finish our cocktails and the plate never got picked up, nobody asked if we wanted to take it to go (which I didn't), but it's hard to sign the check with a big plate of food sitting in front of you when the meal is clearly over. 

The space is very cool, I'd definitely come back for cocktails in the lounge area but I probably won't eat here again."}
{"text":"The convenience of this restaurant and the openness is really what it has going for it. I don't know about the bad Things said about the openness of the kitchen but the concept of the patio and open windows were pretty awesome at night.
That being said, the food is wayyyy over priced for what you get. I stayed at the hotel so I was at the restaurant about 3 out of 5 nights of my stay. The steak is sub par at $35. You get THREE jumbo shrimp with the shrimp and pasta. I'm sorry but for 20+ dollars I should get at least 5 pieces.
I have mixed feelings about the staff. The host was just chatting up a storm and doesn't really notice anyone unless you make eye contact with them. 
I sat at a table the first night and the middle aged server was awesome. He was very knowledgeable about the beer and the food. The beer was about $6 which is pretty comparable to other places. Other mixed feelings come from he bar staff. I told a friend about the place and he had a few drinks with me. One bartender made a drink for him.... not your typical drink so he probably should've looked it up. The drink wasn't great so he asked the other bartender to make it. I think our original bartender was offended so we were punished by being obviously ignored for the rest of the night. The bar needs to get t together"}
{"text":"Ahhhh I wanted to like this place!! Came here with a party of 4. 

The decor and vibe is A+. Very hip and modern. Didnt even realize it was a hotel at first. 

The menu looked amazing - had some great dishes that seemed really good. 

I got the pizza and it was pretty tasteless. Sauce didnt kick any flavor and the crust was pretty bland as well. Really had to put some salt, pepper and olive oil to get some taste. 

Everyone else's meals looked real good but lacked taste. 

Service was pretty good cept they left our dishes in front of us and brought the check. Was extremely strange to try and sign the check around all the dishes."}
{"text":"I've been to match upwards of 5 times due to its proximity to my friend's apartment (can't beat across the street). We usually go for happy hour, which, to be honest, is nothing special. They have cocktails for 6.20$, but the menu is very limited and the drinks are fairly simple and not very tasty. The best of the bunch is essentially fruity soda with alcohol in it. Their play on the caiparinha is awful regardless of the fruit they put in it. On a recent trip, the husband wanted a beer and asked the bartender if beer was on happy hour....She said it was and it was 4$ but then after pouring and serving the beer she told us she thought maybe it was no longer on hh. She then charged us full price (6$). Not cool. So if you're a beer drinker, this is not your hh. I have tried a couple of their non hh cocktails and they were alright, but not worth their 13$ price tag. I tried the play on iced Vietnamese coffee, which is oddly green, and tastes decent but didnt blow me away, and their hot coffee drink with whiskey, which was super strong....The booze totally overpowered any other flavor. As far as food goes, I really like their hh hummus (which isn't hummus at all but a celery root puree). It's served with yummy pickled veggies and Noble bread.... That's worth ordering for sure. I tried the Jamaican patties and they were alright. 

The best part of this bar is the atmosphere. The hotel is cool and has interesting article throughout. The bathrooms are awesome. If this place could revamp their hh menu to include a couple tasty, crowd pleasing drinks and stop worrying so much about the 'concept' of liquors from around the world, I think they could find more success."}
{"text":"Amazing place with the perfect ambient atmosphere. Makes Downtown Phoenix shine great food and that Koffee Beer is amazing. I'll be coming back here for sure"}
{"text":"This is my go to spot w my husband. Living in DT makes this spot a hot spot from the modern and sophisticated decor to the awesome artwork displayed through out. So depending on the time their menu changes but let me say everything on their menu is delicious!! I love their fries w the two choices of dipping sauce, their gnocchi side is buttery rich goodness that melts in your mouth. Lobster bisque soup is very rich w large chunks of lobster in there! Absolutely delicious and hearty. And my favorite is the Korean BBQ short ribs that comes on a bed of papaya salad. Absolute heaven in my mouth. Did I mention their bloody Mary's and amazing cocktail selection made from fresh pressed Karma juice?? Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"International fusion with Mexican cuisine.  Nice atmosphere and good food.  The staff are nice too.  Live music.  Front door is hard to find as it is the hotel double doors which is not staffed, dark and looks like the back door.  Hostess booth is also tucked in the back to the right when it should be up front where the musician is.  Menu changes and our meal was last day before new menu"}
{"text":"We came in on a Thursday night. There was one table on the patio, and five inside totaling 13 patrons. There were maybe three people at the bar. We were promptly seated by the hostess, who came back about five minutes later with water. A two-top was seated at one of the high-tops adjacent to the kitchen. Their order was taken and drinks delivered in a very timely manner. We, however, were there 20-25 minutes and not a single staff member even looked our direction. We were in the dead center of the dining room, but apparently had our invisibility cloaks on. The staff to patron ratio, including kitchen crew, was very close to 1:1 so we left feeling quite baffled. 

Good luck."}
{"text":"Quite the ambiance at this new spot downtown Phoenix in a newer boutique hotel.  Craft cocktails are well done and delicious, and the small plates that we shared were very tasty, with the wings and the summer rolls being the standouts.  Go check out this spot!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stayed at the hotel for our anniversary. We stopped by MATCH for happy hour before we went out to dinner. The server was very friendly. They have some very reasonable drink prices for happy hour and some nice appetizers and meal items on the menu as well. Great spot for happy hour if your downtown or staying at the hotel. We will definitely come back for happy hour and stay for dinner sometime. Great ambiance and atmosphere and very nice patio area for the Phoenix \"winter\"."}
{"text":"The food menu is very limitted.  While its very eclectic there is nothing that knocks your socks off. We had the Korean BBQ lettuce wraps and apple pancakes.  Both were alright."}
{"text":"To begin with... There's no big sign.. and it's in a hotel with no noticeable signage.  You can valet park for free . Advisable!!  Once i find it, the environment was pleasing and the menu interesting.  Bottomless mimosas and bloody Mary's for $15.. Yup.. some expense.. the food was decent and the ambience agreeable if a $30 brunch agrees with you.  Fee sitting areas"}
{"text":"Use to be great.  Been several times. Same great space, cool bar BUT service, food, and menu options have seriously changed.  Good luck finding dinner on their one page mini menu.  What happened guys?"}
{"text":"The fried macaroni and cheese ball was bomb. The guacamole and chips were bomb. The over priced drinks, half a bomb. The little tiramisu and cheesecake desserts, bomb!!  The service was not the greatest. Nice people but very slow. Nice paintings on the wall if you're into that type of stuff."}
{"text":"Ate brunch here on Mother's Day. Great atmosphere and friendly, professional service. Food was great. And the Bloody Mary was just spicy enough. Looking forward to have dinner there in the near future."}
{"text":"Found myself here on a Sunday morning around 10. Went for the Bloody Mary. Glad I did. Very flavorful & spicy but not too nuts with the heat. Bartender and host so friendly! I really liked them and the small talk exchange was pleasant & funny (especially since I'm not one for senseless small talk). Although the manager passed me by several times without so much as a hello. He could learn a thing or two from his much friendlier staff. Moving on... I can't wait to try their food because their menu looks amazing however this was a boozing only visit (hungover...don't judge). Apparently breakfast runs til 10:30, brunch begins at 11. Hmmm. What about the twilight zone from 10:30-11? I didn't ask but did wonder to myself. You know those \"I just don't care\" moments? That was one of them. I'm sure they'll feed you if you happen to wander in during that hallucinatory time.
Bonus- $10.86 for 2 damn good Bloody Marys! I'll be back to this place and I definitely recommend based on my positive bar experience."}
{"text":"Went to Match for dinner tonight. Still not impressed with any of the entrees on the menu. I had the short ribs. It was ok. I won't order this again. I should have just had a hamburger. The 
server said they will have a new menu a few days. In my humble opinion, Match needs a lot of work on the food."}
{"text":"Came for happy hour and was immediately enjoying the atmosphere upon walking in. The walls are covered in tasteful Art Deco and the seating is plentiful! The interior gives the feel of a big city upscale hotel restaurant and bar....but without the stuffy crowd and uptight wait staff. The view of the light rail and The Feve was cool because the restaurant is elevated so it creates a great panoramic shot of Central Ave.

The wine by the glass selection didn't impress me but the variety of items on the menu had me curious. I will need to come back for dinner to try more. 

I ordered the samosas and chicken wings from the 620 happy hour menu. The samosas were fantastic. They had a little bit of a kick to them...but it wasn't overpowering. They were nice and meaty and served in soft warm pillows of pastry dough. The side of tahini sauce helped w/ the heat of the spices inside the samosas. The chicken wings were huge....but a little prehistoric looking. They were def not \"bar wings\"...but rather an upscale take on a \"bar wing\". There wasn't anything super special about them but they're chicken wings....so no big deal. 
The lobster bisque, however,......THAT was a real treat. The broth is not pink and bland like most lobster bisques. It is mushroom in color and has a smooth crimini mushroom flavor that envelops the lobster nicely. Each bite packs a warm hearty flavor and every other bite you find a perfectly cooked gnocchi on your spoon. If you dine here the lobster bisque is a MUST HAVE. The staff was fantastic and very attentive. I would love to give 5 stars but didn't eat enough to really experience what this place is all about. I'll be back for dinner soon."}
{"text":"Such a great place. So swanky and fun. 
Not cheap by any stretch but actually fair priced for hotel fare. 
We are locals and frequent the foundre. I love the vibe and staff. 
Try the wedge by the pool for lunch. 
Their Mules are spot on, delicious and refreshing. 
Burgers were delicious and fries always have the extra little salt and herb touches. 
YUM!! 
Room service-
Eggs Benedict, yum; because I love eggs Benny's. However, room service as it may be the eggs were over cooked (likely due to transit) and the hollandaise sauce could use some salt or zest. 
Pancakes are tasty, thin and very artisanal, nicely not overdone and a good starter to the day in a less heavy fashion than pancakes are thought to be. 

We'll be back. We love the foundre."}
{"text":"We came here for our Father's Day celebration.  It was terrific.  Very interesting concept in the building where you order everything - including cocktails - at the register and take a seat.  Loved the $5 mimosas and bloody mary's.  The husband and son got the Father's Day hash and said it was richly loaded with beef.  I went for the Hazelnut French Toast with vanilla butter and bourbon syrup.   Oh MY what a plate of deliciousness that was.  I snarfed ut before I had a chance to take a pic.  Amazing.  The son and hubby tried it and coveted it.  (The rest of the family were fine with their yummy breakfast burritos)  I had a couple of swell mimosas to wash down that french toast which I am already trying to figure out when I can go get again!"}
{"text":"Good food and nice environment.  Free valet but only for the 1st two hours.   Our waiter was great throughout except when we got to the end.  It took him an unnecessarily long time to bring our checks considering it wasn't that busy.  Minor details.   I'd still go back for the food and bottomless mimosas."}
{"text":"We're visiting the area this weekend and came for Sunday brunch. Location and ambiance is great... very close to the Heard Museum and a couple of art galleries. The decor is very modern artsy and is pretty cool. Breakfast entrees are all $10... nice and simple. 

I ordered the red chili chilaquiles and an extra spicy Bloody Mary. The Bloody Mary needed more spice, but was decent. For those vegetarians out there like me, there's no fish sauce/anchovies in the Bloody Mary mix they use. The chilaquiles were yummy and definitely have a little kick to them! They have a slightly smokey taste... I was a fan. My husband ordered the Arizona omelette and enjoyed it. Oh, and even though the menu doesn't indicate it, the omelette comes with a side salad and some breakfast potatoes. Also, the portions are reasonable - not too big, not too small. 

Overall good experience!"}
