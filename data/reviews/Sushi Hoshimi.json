{"text":"Great sushi at great value! Too far if you live in the city of Montreal. If you get in the area I definitely recommend this place for take out. I called them with a specific time and everything was ready when I arrived. The staff was welcoming."}
{"text":"I loved this place so much!  delicious, fresh, so reasonably priced and excellent service; a hole in the wall with run by such a super sweet family - have to highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Maybe it's because my parents own a small diner and I see them work their fingers to the bone for nothing other than the love of owning their own place -- but I love cute mom and pop restaurants like this. Especially since up until now my experiences with sushi in Montreal have either been to sushi buffets with questionable quality and hygiene, or Sushi Shop where the lack of soul is palpable. 

Never one to turn down a good bargain for quality sushi, I am so happy this place is here. Prices are affordable (comparable if not better than Sushi Shop), sushi is fresh and high quality, and you support a family-owned business. Contrary to another review I had no communication issues with the owners. They take orders by the item number, so unless you need elaborate explanations or to make complicated changes to an item, I can't foresee any language issues. 

Recommend this place for take-out (they also deliver) or a casual sit-down meal with loved ones."}
{"text":"Very decent price for sushi and the food does not disappoint, it's actually very good and fresh! It's a very small restaurant so there is usually only one person making the sushis and makis so you might want to order in advance since it can take up to 1 hour and a half for them to make the sushi because of the numerous orders they get but at least they let you know in advance. They are victim of their own success!"}
{"text":"Awesome, cosy, small place. Staff extremely friendly. Not stingy at all. Ask for a glass of water and they give you a bottle.  Sushi tastes great, too."}
{"text":"It's a good price-quality-quantity-proximity ratio for me. I know that's a very specific sounding formula, but The owners are also pretty nice! That's another good reason to check it out."}
{"text":"Love this place we always keep on going back there it's always fresh and clean the food and quality is at its top the service is good and it's made on the spot no prepare in advance made meals and if you ask the chef you can watch how she makes it and as far for delivery it's always the same driver and I give him 2$ .... And he always appreciative of what I give him"}
{"text":"First time ordering from them and the food was fresh and delicious. Price wise, the place is affordable. It's family owned and that, to me, it's a definite plus. Try it out!"}
{"text":"What a little gem in NDG. I can't say anything bad about this place. Sushi is made fresh and is always delicious. Service is amazing and delivery was quick. My go to spot for sushi from now on."}
{"text":"This sushi place should NOT have any negative reviews. I absolutely LOVE their sushi, it's always made so fresh and tasty!! The staff doesn't speak english very well but they always manage to make u understand when u ask them questions. It's a little family business and it will always be my num 1 sushi shop for my cravings!!"}
{"text":"Hoshimi is one of my favorite sushi places in Montreal. The food is delicious and the owner is extremely friendly. I recommend the Dynamite Delux, Tomago, and the Unagi."}
{"text":"Definitely follow the tips and go with takeout.  I made the mistake of sit down so the service was incredibly sloooooooow. But on the bright side, our waiter was the helpful 10 year old son of the owner. He didn't have service down to an art but it was cute. 

The food is quite alright, but I prefer my sushi rice on the drier side and my tempura crunchy. Overall ok but due to the fact I had to wait for an hour (no joke) for relatively \"fast food\" is a bit disappointing for me."}
{"text":"I haven't posted in a while but my Fiance and I just had an interesting experience...

We ordered $44.00 worth of sushi for delivery from Sushi Hoshimi. 

The sushi is fantastic and it's unfortunate that the delivery driver almost intruded into our apartment demanding more tip. He was extremely aggressive, put his foot in our door! He even threatened to call his boss. lol. Did he? No. My Fiance ended up closing the door on his face - he had no choice, I saw it. 

Never in our lives has this happened to us before. This driver was totally crazy. We've ordered for delivery 3 times and EACH time he was rude. 

As I said, the sushi is great, but this made my jaw drop. We order from somewhere else now. 

The sushi is good at Sushi Hoshimi, but not *that* good. :-S"}
