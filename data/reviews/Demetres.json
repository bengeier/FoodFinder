{"text":"I had a good experience at this spot. Its a dessert oriented place.  I ordered the apple crisp crepe and the 'Day n' white \" milkshake. It was amazing and I would definitely recommend those items.   The service was good for me. No issues there for me. When you're done, instead of calling for the bill you simply walk up to the register to pay. I think that's pretty convenient. You don't have to be waiting around after your meal.   I would recommend this place to everyone looking for some tasty desserts"}
{"text":"My order: strawberry Greek frozen yogurt single scoop sundae on a waffle cone Double Americano coffee My friend's order: vanilla milkshake  They mixed up my order and gave me vanilla ice cream instead the strawberry Greek frozen yogurt.  I asked the waiter he said that was the right order. That only fresh pieces of strawberries were part if the ice cream.  He was kind enough to offer to bring some strawberry syrup on the side to wich I agreed.   But since I was si certain the menu description said something along the lines of \"strawberries overnight marinated mixed with Greek yogurt\" I couldn't believe I had misread so I asked if he could bring me the menu.  As I was reading it he came to me and acknowledged that in fact the kitchen had mixed up my order and had given me plain vanilla ice cream (which is my least favourite type of ice cream as it's just blah! ).  He offered to bring me one scoop of the strawberry frozen Greek yogurt I had order on the side. I said yes.  But this is what I would have done if I were the manager of this place: I would have brought my customer what she ordered in the first place, honour what I have described on the menu and prepare a fresh brand new sundae the way it was meant to be and according to the menu description called Katy Berry.  Rather than a side scoop without whipped cream/waffle and toppings.   The service was good, fast and courteous but I cannot understand why they are not wiser about fixing their kitchen's mixed up orders with their customers.   I would not come back here when there are other choices around.   Americano Coffee was too watery and rathwr5 lukewarm.   My friends milkshake was served in a bottom narrow glass so the actual quantity was rather small and deceiving from the way it looks from the outside.   Total bill $25 including tip and taxes for 1 milkshake,  1 single scoop sundae and 1 Americano coffee."}
{"text":"Service was nice but slow. I had red velvet cake and Oreo icecream. The oreo icecream was horrible I asked her to take it off my plate. The red velvet cake was bland and tasteless. I ordered a diet coke and didn't even get a full cup. I got it in a vintage coke bottle that was only 237ml and paid 2.75 for that!  This place was good back in the day. I will no longer be going there."}
{"text":"I had a terrible experience at Caffe Demetre last night. My girlfriend and I came in and waited for at the reception area for 10 minutes, without once being even acknowledged by one of the many employees walking past us. No one once said hello to us or told us how long the wait was. When a table cleared up, the manager cleared the table, wiped it clean, and then still avoided making any eye contact with us. A couple minutes later he rudely gestured for us to come sit down at a table next to the door. It was -8 degrees tonight, so naturally it was very chilly by the door, and my girlfriend and I waited for another table to clear up so we could ask to be switched over. Another 10 minutes go by while we wait at our table, and still no one has acknowledged our presence, let alone asked us what we'd like to order. Eventually we switch our tables and no one asks what we'd like to order. Frustrated, I waved down the manager and asked if we could order, and he says he'll tell a server to be right with us. Another 10 minutes go by and no one shows up, so I have to get up and go to the kitchen and tell them my order myself. All we wanted was some tea and hot chocolate, nothing complicated. When we finally get our drinks (over an hour after we first arrived at the place), none of the servers once came by to check on us to see how we were doing, if we wanted anything else, or if we wanted the bill. I eventually had to waive down a server and ask for the bill. After we paid, we asked to speak to the manager, and this is when things went from bad to worse. I began telling the manager we were unhappy with the service, and he becomes super defensive and starts yelling at us about how busy the restaurant was, and how we're lucky to even be served. He doesn't give me a single opportunity to explain why I was unhappy about the service, but continued to defend himself. After I tell him I don't want to argue, he continued arguing with himself and walked away. As we left the restaurant, I approached him again to ask him whether he was just the manager, or the owner of the store, to which he replied he was the owner. I said that was unfortunate, because I would have to file a formal complaint now to have my concerns heard, to which he started yelling at the top of his lungs in front of all the staff and customers about how we were lucky to even be served, and how he took care of us when we wanted to be moved, all the while never actually hearing any of our concerns. I like the food at Demetre's but I'll definitely be going to the Courtney Park location from now on."}
{"text":"Overpriced.  Mediocre service.  Dry cakes.  The waffle and I've cream was decent though.  It's a place to go to when you need a dessert place when another isn't open or too far."}
{"text":"I've always liked Caffe Demetre because it's tough to find a good dessert place. But this location really needs new management! The service is absolute crap.   I went today with my fiancé to get some chocolate cake. Upon entering, I noticed it was busy but not too full. There were still quite a few tables, and there seemed to be two or three servers (can't tell if the third was a server or hostess). We waited for over five minutes as the servers constantly passed us by, avoiding eye contact. Finally a male who looked like it was his first day on the job sat us down.  After being seated, we went through the menu and picked what we wanted but didn't receive any service. No server greeting us, no water, etc. We spent at least 10 minutes trying to wave a server down. The guy that sat us down saw us wave at least 3 times but proceeded to ignore us. Even though the waitresses were constantly passing us by to server other tables, they ignored us multiple times! At this point I was close to walking out but we finally got a waitress to come by and take our order.  After finishing up, we were able to wave the waitress down to request our bill. Getting our bill took another 10 or so minutes, despite the waitress passing us by constantly. At this point  I decided not to tip. This was no better than getting take out.  Management seriously needs a revamp here. Someone has to train these servers!"}
{"text":"Must Try: Crepe Creation or Waffle Creations, Milkshakes  Rating: (9/10) Food, (9/10) Service, (8/10) Value, (10/10) Ambience, (9/10) Presentation, (10/10) Cleanliness  My Experience:    A great addition to Downtown Markham! With the East Beaver Creek location no longer there, this new location brings the fan favourite dessert shop back, refreshed and even better than before!  Personally, I come here for either the waffle or crepe creations, the specific creation will depend on your personal preference. I usually go with the Bliss as I'm a fan of strawberries. The milkshakes are also delicious, though their size means you should really share it.   Demetre's is a bit higher end on the price scale, but you get the quality you pay for. Not a place to get cheap eats, but an excellent spot to take a date or to catch up with friends!  The setting is adorable, with nice pastel colours and a large open kitchen. With everything being new, this location is very clean with great attentive service. My personal fav detail are the names of the dishes, which are all very (very!) witty."}
{"text":"Worse example of customer service I have experienced in my life. Didn't get shown to the table by anyone for over 5 minutes when the hostess was interested in talking to the other workers than to bother with customers waiting.  Got a table, finally, but no one came to take an  order for over 15 minutes. There were only about 3 tables with customers. I wanted to give this place a chance but it seems that they don't want my business. I just left and no one even bothered to come and talk to me as I was leaving. They should close this place down. Terrible service. Never go there again."}
{"text":"Demetres in general has really good dessert but this location doesn't have great service. I've been multiple times during the day, evening, weekend and weekday! And really, no matter what day you go on, service just never seems to be good and it gets 10x worse during peak hours.   My most recent visit was with my parents. We were waiting to watch our movie and decided to kill some time with desserts and coffee! We went around 9:30 (can't remember which day) and it was pretty busy but got seated quickly, we arrived just in time for a group to be leaving. We got seated with menus and waited, waited, waited and waited.... We wanted to be nice and give the waitress a chance since it was busy and we had time to kill anyway. We finally made our order after 15-20 mins. We ordered one piece of cake and two coffees...easy right? Well we waited another 20-25 mins...almost going on 30... and tried getting someone's attention but nothing! So we ended up leaving.....  I don't even know why I keep going to this one. Probably cuz it's close to home and convenient.  So if you go to this one. Try going when you think it might not be too busy."}
{"text":"The interior decor is awesome. Bright with high ceiling and interesting interior design. There are variety of desserts/ice cream you can choose from. This is a nice place for family or friends gathering. The setting is bright, spacious and relax. My group is greeted by a friendly server and we ordered a New York Cheesecake, Apple Pie Ala Mode, and a Banana Split. The portion in most of orders is generous. I have never seen a slice of New York cheesecake that tall and thick. The scoop of ice cream in Apple Pie Ala Mode is Big. The Banana Split takes two people to finish. A Great Place!!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Caffé Demetré for dessert since I was in High School. It's a great place to go to hang out with friends for a late night chat over some sweet treats.   It's a really cool café that specializes only in desserts and drinks. They have a massive menu of waffles, ice cream, cakes, crepes, coffees and teas!  The service here is fair only because they are always jam packed, especially late at night after a movie. The atmosphere inside is LOUD! Not the best place for if you're looking to enjoy your dessert in peace.   Whenever I get a dessert menu placed in front of me, there's a good chance that I'll choose something that ends with \"cake\". The portions here are more than generous so make sure you're hungry! Not the best idea to be eating desserts late at night but once in a while is okay.   Caffé Demetré is a great dessert place with so many choices that you can't try everything all in one go. They have a lot of incredible creations too!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try out Café Demetres, so maybe my expectations were a little high. The first time we tried coming here, the line was out the door so we left. The second time I visited was on a Sunday afternoon at around 6PM while waiting for a movie at Cineplex. It wasn't busy at all, maybe 4 other tables of people in total.  Customers service was pretty slow. We were seated immediately but it took forever to flag down the waitress to take our order. I ordered the banana split and it took 20 minutes for it to arrive (how long does it take to assemble 3 scoops of icecream??) We ended up rushing to finish because it took so long and we had to rush to our movie. When we were finished, we had to wait for a waiter to come out so we could flag them for the bill.   The banana split was really nice though. I want to try their other desserts, especially the cakes! I'd come back again just to try out the rest of the menu, and I hope the service speeds up a bit. The prices are pretty high for desserts - our banana split came to about $15 with tip.  TLDR; slow service, good desserts, kind of pricey."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to try the desserts here, however the first time we went the line up was completely out the door. The second time we were seated within 5 minutes. The place was relatively empty, however all the tables along one wall are super close to eachother so unfortunately our date felt a little awkward because there was essentially 4 strangers sat practically at the same table as us. We waited a considerable amount before our waitress took our order. We then spent like 30 minutes waiting for our coffees and crepe (I don't see how either take that long to make when it was so dead). Another 30 minute wait for the waiter to bring our bill and the debit machine. The dessert was great, however the service was lacking, and we couldn't truly enjoy our date because the music and people around us was all so loud we couldn't hear eachother speaking."}
{"text":"When I saw Demetres opened 10 minutes away from me, I made it a mission to check it out the next day. :D I originally thought this opened in the Cineplex plaza but it is actually located across the street...so if you parked on the wrong side be prepared to run across the street.  Be careful though!   The decor of this restaurant is delightfully bright, full of pastels colours, and florals. The chairs and the seating of the restaurant were plentiful and spacious.   I ordered the pomme pilot with Roché ice cream and it more than satisfied the sweet tooth. The ice cream scoop was very generous and the apple pie and crumbles covered most of the crepe. The crepe did get soggy near the end, but you can ask for the ice cream to be served separately from the crepe. Also, we ordered the Nutella milkshake and omg, it was like drinking melted Nutella. Sooo good, but way too much chocolate after eating the giant scoop of roché ice cream."}
{"text":"i used to bring my friend there, and i will no longer do so. Reason is that the service is so terrible. The waitress ignores us and it took a long time to get her attention. recently their price has gone up so much. a glass bottle of coke used to cost only $1 early last year, recently it went up to $3. Will never go again."}
{"text":"New & improved. Comparing this location to the now-closed East Beaver Creek experiences: This spot has better service, better space & better food. The decor is vibrant and adorable. This place was packed when I went - we waited 20 minutes for a table for 2 on a sunday night. The place is NOISY - a little too loud.  Food came out quickly and was much better than what I typically expect from Demetres. Ice cream is firm and dense (I love the honey vanilla & coco chanel flavours). The waffle was crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside and came with a generous serving of strawverries. They definitely didn't skimp on fresh fruit toppings, which I find a lot of dessert places do."}
{"text":"Dessert wise they are great. Lots to choose from, I absolutely love there waffles. The downside is that the services never seems to be good. The last time I went I was sitting for about 15-20 minutes before a server finally came and to take my order. Seems as though they are always short staffed."}
{"text":"Went for desserts last nite at Demetre's. Was seated immediately. Nice service. The desserts were good as always. Have been consistent through the many times we have visited."}
{"text":"We got seated Sat night after waiting for 20 min at the door.   Waiter brought us water and left us for 30 min. No menu, no service  I flagged the waiter down and a gesture of wait a  minute was signalled to us.  Unfortunately, no one followed up.  We finally got up and left and went somewhere else for dessert."}
{"text":"came here craving some desserts with a total of 4 people and got two dishes to share  the Demetres is very cute and pretty and a great place to hang out. They play nice quiet music   we got the blush and it had milk chocolate instead of white chocolate. the ice cream portion was very large and the waffle was good. however pretty expensive at $14 so it is recommended to share this was a 4.5/5  the red velvet cake was average and would not recommend for the price of $8 does not compare to Cheesecake Factory red velvet cheesecake with its big portions and taste a lot better this was a 3.5/5   Other occasions I have gotten a sundae which is not worth the price and very sweet. I have also gotten a crepe which is pretty good as well. the names of the desserts are also really cute and have puns, makes me laugh  the service here is very good they were nice and quick to give the food. overall I would recommend everyone to try once but I would only come when I am willing to splurge or if you want to take someone on a date cause it's so cute."}
{"text":"The Demetres in Downtown Markham has finally opened. This may be both a blessing (in the event of late night dessert cravings) and a curse (because it is almost too close to home).   The cafe itself is very pretty and girly with its pastel coloured decor and massive floral feature wall. It has a very fresh and open feel to the space.   The menu has a few of the previous classics I've come to love over the years (like the crepe or waffle classic A Streetcar Named Devour) as well as some newer options like Berry Your Feelings. We ordered the Splitsonian (Honey Vanilla ice cream, strawberries, bananas and Nutella), Unbrulevable (dulce and banana ice cream, bruleed banana, caramel sauce and nuts), and Berry Your Feelings (ice cream, berry compote, and roasted almonds). At the time we went (Sunday at 2pm, when they opened), the crepe batter was not ready which forced us to order the more expensive waffle options. They were also out of Salted Honey Crackle ice cream so we had to swap that with another ice cream.  Service was reasonably attentive. I imagine this place will be very busy during the evening hours and on weekends. Will most certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Slow and horrible service. Portions are way smaller then what they used to serve at other locations but the price is higher. Strawberries are cut so thin it's almost a joke that they count as a topping and even then you are lucky if you get more then 6 pieces. Not worth it."}
{"text":"I'm quite conflicted over Demetres. On one hand we had a great tasting dessert in the Katy Berry ice cream sundae in the waffle cone. On the other hand, we were given the bill without asking for it.   The Katy Berry sundae was great. The strawberry ice cream was very refreshing and delightfully full of strawberry flavor. It's also worth noting the ice cream had a 'toughness' to it which means it's good ice cream! It also wasn't overly sweet and the waffle cone was excellent. It was definitely freshly made! This is a great dessert.   However, as many others have noted, customer service here was a bit off. While we were seated fairly quickly, it did take a while to order and we were given the bill without asking for it. There was clearly no one waiting and there were tables available. We didn't stay too long either, so I didn't think it was warranted."}
{"text":"First Impressions: The restaurant was very colourful and when I first walked in, I smelled a wonderful aroma of baked goods and desserts. When I saw the dishes coming out to the tables, I got very excited as the presentation made the food look so delicious.  When I first entered the restaurant, I gave my name to a lady and she said that when a table became available, she would let us know. I waited a total of 30 minutes, which in itself is not very long, but became an issue when guests that entered the restaurant after us got seated first. When my friends and I noticed this, we went up to the same lady and she said our name wasn't even on the list, which is just absolutely ridiculous.  We watched her enter our name, so unless she deleted it, there would have been no way that it disappeared.   We were then given a table and another hostess and man apologized for this matter so we let it go.   The food itself was alright, although I think it was a little too sweet. I ordered the Splitsonian Crepe. I think there was too much ice cream and strawberries compared to the ratio of crepe. The strawberries were a bit sour and the vanilla ice cream in my opinion was way too overpowering. But that may be because vanilla is not my cup of tea.  Although this review is mostly negative, I certainly will not give up! I will definitely give this restaurant another try as I believe that it might just have been some bad luck on that night."}
{"text":"It has gotten expensive here. $15 for a waffle with ice cream and $14 for a crepe and ice cream.  Ice cream here of course is delicious and so are the waffles and ice cream. But with their prices continuously increasing every time they do their new menu every few months, I'll be going to other dessert places more often.  The coffee is gross. :("}
{"text":"Demetres still has the best crepes in the city, in my opinion. My usual order is the Moo La La, but this time I tried the Unbrulevable - with brûléed banana, butter caramel sauce & praline croquant. So good! I like how their menu is full of pun-ny names.   I thought this brand was dying but the rebranding seems pretty good, and this Downtown Markham location is perfect. The décor is very colourful and spring-themed and it is the perfect place for catching up with friends over dessert!"}
{"text":"Demetre's is a great dessert place to go with friends. The desserts are extremely yummy but also extremely sweet. So if you don't like overly sweet desserts you might not want to go here. They give a generous amount of ice cream on their waffles which was great!"}
{"text":"Not sure why there are so many negative reviews. I disagree with many of them, and it seems like this place has changed it's ways in terms of service. We enjoyed our experience here, and will certainly return for the sundaes alone. The service wasn't bad, though for a desert shop it does draw an oddly aggressive crowd. Our waitress was very helpful and timely. It's pretty pricey, but the desserts are lovely. Perfect for a post-movie snack or an after-dinner indulgence."}
{"text":"Baaaaaadddd service: we had to wait 5 minutes to be seated in a half full restaurant. Finally when one of the two waitresses decided to notice us she was very nice and very polite. She pointed us to a corner of the cafe saying, \"You can sit here this is our cleanest area.\" We waited another 10 mins before we ordered and i had to yell \"excuse me\" before she came by to take our order. But again when we were ordering she was polite.  Last time i came here they gave us a table next to the restrooms in a half empty cafe. The foods great. So i guess i will just b going to another location next time."}
{"text":"This was probably the worst Demetres Dessert location l have been too in the last 5 five years it was deadly slow to seat us and was total chaos and total disorganized and  the waiter was awful at servicing us normally water is brought to the table first then normally drinks are ordered and brought to table the the desserts . But it was not like that at all last night the waiter kept going by us ignoring us at first and then when our drinks were brought there were aweful and not what they should of been !!!! We're very disappointed with last night and will not be returning to this location as with a brand name like your ever location should be exactly serving the same product quality and taste and here was nothing like l get at the brant st location which really serves top notched desserts l hope you take this review seriously and fix that location cause it make all your locations look bad ."}
{"text":"Demetres had always been a place to go when I crave for dessert to SHARE! I was super thrilled when I heard they finally opened up a location in downtown Markham. This newly opened café held a very fun and innovative appeal. I LOVE their cute decorations on the ceiling will have you stare at it for hours. Their colourful seats were pretty comfortable and the place was really spacious!   We came here on a Thursday evening and the place was pretty busy. The wait was reasonable and the staffs were friendly and delivered prompt service. Their items on the menu still remain the same as before but they redesigned the menu which I like!   We tried the Splitsonian crepe ($14.50)- came with fresh strawberries & banana and a HUGE scoop of vanilla ice cream. We were able to swap the vanilla ice cream to Cocoa Chanel. The crepe was very well made and the fruits were pretty fresh. I really like the Cocoa Chanel ice cream- chocolate base with HUGE chunks of brownies and oreo pieces! I felt like I was through ice cream heaven! The ice cream was definitely on the sweeter side of the spectrum.   Overall, I really enjoy this experience. I'm definitely going to revisit this place."}
{"text":"Sugar overload. I used to really like demetre now they are A okay. The menu is overwhelmingly huge . The various crepes tried have been good but after eating i feel kinda terrible. I dont know if its the quality of materials or jus the excessive sugar. There are better dessert places in town ."}
{"text":"High ceiling, carpet floor, and spacious... The atmosphere is definitely a lot more comfortable than most other Demetres locations. Came in the afternoon, since it is not crowded and quiet, you actually get to relax and enjoy the food.  They didn't have the salted honey crackle ice-cream that come with Berry Your Feelings Your Feelings so we changed to the recommended honey vanilla flavor. The sour and salty flavor of the berries and the roasted almond are excellent complement of the slightly over sweet honey vanilla flavor ice-cream.  For Mo La La, the Roche ice-cream is mixed with generous amount of praline, which gives it a very nutty texture like the Roche chocolate. Like a typical Roche ice-cream from other ice-cream joint, it tends to be a bit too sweet, and mixed with nutella and banana doesn't seem to bring the best out of this dish.  Overall, they will need to ensure all the main ingredients from their default menu is available. Service is excellent on this not busy day, but making of the orders will require improvement. Imagine if you were coming with a date and each of you order a dish, one of you could finish 90% of the dish before the other dish arrives. If I was dating and mine come first, I would end up having a \"milkshake and crepe\"."}
{"text":"Demetre's is absolutely fantastic! The dessert menu never seems to disappoint and the overall plating of every dish is art on a plate. Not to mention, the new Markham location is in the heart of downtown Markham, right next to the movie theatre and other exciting food places.  The desserts were quite sweet (obviously!) but I think my sweet tooth would definitely bring me back to the Splitsonian - a banana split like dish that can be served over waffles or crepes. The fruit were quite fresh and everything was put together with finesse. I will definitely be coming back and dragging my friends here because the atmosphere is very soothing."}
{"text":"We were in the mood for having dessert somewhere after dinner, and our friends suggested this place.  We ordered Pomme Pilot crepe ($14.50)  - a heavenly combination! The order came with apple and cinnamon streusel and it tasted like an apple pie. It was the perfect mix of buttery apple cinnamon goodness with a generous topping of white chocolate ice cream. The crepes are nice, light, and not overwhelmingly sweet and guaranteed to warm your heart like a soft and gentle hug. The crepe was thin, full of vanilla flavour and delicious. It was crispy along the edges and perfectly moist. The crepe alone was my FAVOURITE part!  The caramel sauce with the apples and cinnamon was good but, the white chocolate ice cream was a little overwhelming. Be sure you have a glass of water and a friend to split it. Tried our friend's order of vanilla icecream - (side note reminder: I will request and swap for vanilla ice cream next time)  As much as I liked the crepe, the caramel sauce and ice cream made the crepe a bit soggy - will request the ice cream and caramel sauce to be placed on the side of plate rather on top of the crepe.  The menu options are a bit pricey but, so are other crepe and waffle places - unfortunately :(  It was very busy at the time we went (Saturday - 10:00pm), luckily, the dining space is spacious and there is a waiting area by the front entrance. A lot of smiles and laughter filling up the place! :)  The server who was working the back tables was polite and attentive.   Parking is decent, but possibly not enough parking spaces once all the store spaces are leased out and occupied in the future.  Clean restrooms - always a good sign!  Highly recommended this place if you are in the neighborhood and craving some yummy goodness."}
{"text":"I'm horrified at the fact that they just don't care the for the visiting patron. Its upsetting that the staff has no ambition on providing the out most service,very disappointed!  No strawberries, no whip cream on a Saturday night, why even open?"}
{"text":"It goes without saying that the desserts here are great. But the downside is the service, it's often very slow and the waiters just don't pay attention to you.   Desserts I recommend at the Choc This Way, Moo Lala, and brownie points. Don't recommend the cheesecake because it's way too cheesy/heavy.   Extra points for the amazingly punny menu!!"}
{"text":"Newly opened in downtown Markham, this location is very aesthetically pleasing. A mix of pastel pinks and yellows reminds me of Easter decorations lol.  I'm sure this place will be nice and busy as we get into the hot summer. I visited on a Saturday afternoon and it wasn't too busy. I ordered their Pomme Pilot crepe and it was great. The crepe was light and the apple crumble was delicious. The white chocolate ice cream serving was huge and got a bit too sweet towards the end.  Service was pretty quick given that there were only a few tables. Will have to revisit during an evening to see how it goes."}
{"text":"very pretty place and very big too so i liked the atmosphere and it was quiet since there was probably only one other table here on a tuesday afternoon. the staff was super nice and checked on us maybe like 5 times haha.   the food was good, but not worth the price in my opinion. we ordered the split something (strawberry banana nutella) crepe and the last straw (strawberry and strawberry jam) waffle. both came with honey vanilla ice cream. the crepe was better than the waffle even though the waffle is $1 more. the strawberries were rlly sour too lol. wasn't a bad experience but i just wouldn't come back to try other flavours cuz the price is too much for what it is ... and tbh you can probably make this stuff at home. if ur craving dessert or ice cream there's cheaper alternatives out there just as good."}
{"text":"The apple pie I ordered was definitely not worth the 14 or so dollars. Tasted like it was baked a week ago, refrigerated, then heated up in a microwave. The ice cream that came along with it was horrible. Demetre's ice cream is the worst I have ever tasted. It's so airy and full of fat, it tastes like sugary grease in your mouth. I want creamy ice cream, not buttery ice cream.  Will not go again."}
{"text":"Very poor management. Very long wait times but they have multiple empty tables. A lot of the staff looks like they dont know what they are doing. The greeter is completely lost. Only staff that was good was the server that walks really fast.   45 minutes wait but the table we were finally seated with has been empty for 15 minutes. They just didnt know what to do with it"}
{"text":"This is by far the prettiest Demetres I've ever been too. Very aesthetic, with a very Instagram worthy wall. The place is very open with ample amounts of seating, although I can imagine it gets super packed on weekends and evenings.   We opted for the Katy Berry (waffle cone, strawberry royale ice cream, strawberries, white chocolate sauce and whipped cream) and the Tongue Depressor (Cocoa Chanel ice cream, brownies, chocolate sauce and white chocolate buttons). They actually allow you to switch out your flavor of ice cream so instead, we got the roché (chocolate hazelnut). Unfortunately, the didn't have the Salted Honey Crackle ice cream. The ice cream scoops are MASSIVE and definitely left me in a sugar coma. Overall the service was fast and attentive and the dessert was excellent.   *Beware of strawberries slipping off your sundae*"}
{"text":"This place just opened about a month ago, so when we came here on a Saturday night it was pretty busy.  But we didnt have to wait that long, they were pretty fast at turning tables over.  Demetres has always been our go to spot for dessert, and was pretty happy to know that they opened this location near a trendy location.  The decor is amazing, bright, spacious and contemporary.  Service is awesome, servers are quick and friendly.  Desserts are awesome as always.  We got the waffle blush and red velvet cheese with a latte and double espresso.  Waffle blush: the waffle was done exceptionally well. Crispy on the outside fluffy in the inside.  The strawberry ice cream tastes like strawberries, not fake strawberries.  They did overkill the fresh strawberries. It was a little too much though.  Red velvet cheese cake: awesome cheesecake, smooth velvety and not overly sweet.  Good amount to even share, if you want lol.  Latte and espresso: pretty basic nothing special, but it goes well with the desserts  For sure I will be back here again, when my sweet tooth starts to crave those delicious desserts."}
{"text":"After the Demetres in Richmond Hill closed I've been waiting forever for the Markham one to open!   My friends and I arrived at around 10pm and it took us half an hour to get seated. This restaurant is definitely busy as it is pretty new. If you're going after 9pm expect a long wait since it's very popular with teenagers and the like.   The food and pricing is the same as any other Demetres but it did take awhile for it to arrive due to the amount of people in the restaurant. They were considerate to try to get most of our dishes out around the same time (helpful for those food pics). Would definitely come again, but maybe not after 9pm to avoid a long wait!"}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant, some orders were messed up but they quickly fixed the issue, staff is very nice as well as manager, and I would definitely go back, the wait for the desserts did take a little while but overall the food was enjoyable!"}
{"text":"This place is super great for whenever you're just looking for a sweet treat. Out of all the Demetres I've been to, this one isn't the best (I love the Square One location) as the actual place isn't decorated as nicely as other locations and the service is pretty mediocre, but hey - dessert's dessert!"}
{"text":"sweetness overload!  The place itself is cute, I love all the pastel tones! Service is... fair. The waitress was friendly but just awfully unavailable.  Also, this restaurant is quite large with many seats, but the waiter who seemed to be in charge of seating just seemed to also like seating people near me...I wanted some space :d  Anyways, my friend ordered a stormy weather drink to start!  The drink was spiked with a huge dose of sugar, topped with whipped cream and caramel syrup. A little too much sugar even for a sugar maniac such as myself. The iced cappuccino was smooth and fragrant, but the drink just wasn't what my friend and I expected.   For our mains, I ordered a customized waffle with silky white Belgian chocolate ice cream, Belgian milk chocolate sauce, fresh strawberries, whipped cream, and brownies to top! The waffle was warm and crisp! I really enjoyed the milk chocolate sauce pairing with the waffle. I wish they had put more whipped cream as it costed me $2 for that splotch. I didnt enjoy the brownies at all. The strawberries were sort of redeeming, but not all of them were sweet, maybe they arent in season?  My friend had the say-cheese cake! The cake was one word: HEAVY. Towards the end, he was just spreading cheese on strawberries lol. He described it as a pound of cheese from Nofrills.  Well, come here if ur feeling for a sugar high, its not too bad :)"}
{"text":"After enjoying a nice movie at the cineplex next door, we decided to stop in at this Demetres which we haven't visited before. We didn't wait too long for a table but the server did take a while to take our order considering there weren't a lot of people. Also noticed that a lot of tables were not cleaned yet, a whole section actually. I always get 'the big apple' from Demetres which was also just as good at this location. We also got a chocolate fudge cake which was good too. We got a shake, the John Lemon one, which tasted really sour so we asked if I can be changed for another  one. The server was really nice and said she would ask the manager but the manager's response was that he wouldn't exchange it simply because we didn't like it. Considering we ordered about $20 worth of stuff we figured he would at least be willing to exchange it. We asked to speak with the manager but he didn't come. The server went back one more time and asked and he said fine just take it off the bill. I'm glad that we didn't have to pay for that since it tasted bad but I feel that the manager could have handled it better."}
{"text":"This is the worst restaurant I have ever been to. We received very bad service on our Saturday night out and the manager-on-duty was so rude. We had to cancel our order and walked out. It ruins our whole evening of fun. We will never go back there again."}
{"text":"I have never felt this disrespected at a restaurant before. I came here yesterday with my boyfriend. I wanted to take him out on a date so I thought having ice cream here would be perfect. We were \"served\" by a waiter called Ramadan. The entire time this waiter was extremely sexist. He would talk only to him, looking at him only, asking only him for the order and any answers to his questions because he was the man present at the table. Just because I'm a woman doesn't mean I don't have a voice. When it came to pay, he gave the bill to him, and ignored me as I told him I was the one paying today. Again when he came to pick up the debit machine, even though I was clearly the one that payed, he addressed him about wanting a copy of the receipt without even looking at me, and walked away when I tried to talk to him. He was incredibly disrespectful, acted as I wasn't even present. I work as a waitress as well. I know exactly what his job entails. He is to never assume anything about a guest, and at the very least should be equally courteous to everyone at the table, and should never ever walk away when a guest is directly addressing him. There is no excuse for his behavior. I couldn't have been more disgusted that a young man thinks it is appropriate to treat woman in such a way in the century we live in. What a way to ruin a nice evening for both me and my boyfriend."}
