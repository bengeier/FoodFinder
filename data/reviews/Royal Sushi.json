{"text":"4.5 stars! I rounded it up to a 5 stars instead of down, because they seem still relatively new and I want them to do well.  Met some friends I haven't seen for a while for a late lunch, around 2:30pm, this past Sunday, and one of them suggested this place. They have quite a few, reasonably priced Lunch Bento Boxes available, served till 3pm. Since it was a late lunch, I didn't want to eat too much, so I shared a Bento Box and a roll with a friend.  Ordered: - L4. Sashimi, Sushi Lunch Bento Combo ($12) - Miso Soup, House Salad, Sashimi 8pcs, Sushi 6pcs, Tempura (1 Shrimp, 2 Veggie), Gyoza, and Japchae - R19. Super Salmon Special Maki ($12) - Spicy Salmon, Tempura Bits topped with Salmon - 8pcs  They don't mention Miso Soup And House Salad for the Special Maki, but they brought out Miso Soup and House Salad for everyone at the table anyways. The Miso Soup had enoki mushrooms in it and was very light. House Salad was fresh with a very light and citrusy dressing, which I think should be made in-house.  All the Special Maki Rolls came nicely presented on a long wood patter. The Super Salmon maki was a nice size, not too small, but not so big that I still couldn't pop the whole piece in my mouth. I would have preferred it if the spicy salmon part was just a bit more spicy though. Since there was Salmon on top as well, and no other sauce, it mellows out the spiciness of the spicy salmon on the inside. Maybe good for people who likes spicy salmon, but can't handle too much spice?  The Sashimi Sushi Bento had a lot of food! I ended up a lot more full than I thought I would be. Sashimi pieces were super fresh, and slices were a good thickness. I think I definitely got more than 8pcs. Rice to Fish ratio was good for the Sushi, the fish slices was big enough to hang over either sides of the rice. Tempura batter was light. I let my friend have the shrimp so, don't know how it tasted, but the veggie ones were good. it wasn't very oily, and even though I left it till the end to eat, it was still had a bit of crisp to it.   Service was great. They brought out our food at the same time, so none of that awkward long waiting for everyone to get their food to start eating. Our waitress was constantly over, refilling our teas, even though we were there for almost 2 hrs. We were offered ice cream on the house at the end. And it was good ice cream too! I got green tea ice cream and it had really good green tea flavour.     My other friends ordered the Black Dragon and the Green Dragon. I didn't try it, but it was very nicely presented and the rolls looked huge! I definitely would want to come back to try some of their other special maki rolls. The sushi and sashimi platters looked pretty good too. Atmosphere was nice as well, you could definitely bring a date here.   Note: They have 3 parking spots right in front of the shop and some more around the back. I would recommend parking in the back. There is entrance to the shop from the back as well. I parked in the front and it was really hard getting out when the other spots are also taken. Plus backing out onto Yonge St. was nearly impossible, so I had to awkwardly do a 5 point turn in that tiny space to make it easier to get out."}
{"text":"Tres bon, ils offrent de super prix le midi, ou des combo avantageux le soir. Un bon sushi simple efficace. Il y a toute une page de sushi specialité mais je n ai pas encore testé. L endroit est propre et pas du tout cher. A deux on a eut 30 morceau dont plein de nigiri , deux miso pour 26$ tax comprises. Je recommande!"}
{"text":"First time visiting and was impressed with the service and the food.  Ordered the shrimp and vegetable tempura and beef tataki to start with.  The tempura was tasty and arrived very hot.  The beef tataki was very tasty and juicy and served with a great sauce - highly recommended.  We ordered an assortment of maki which were all very good, especially liked the white knight.    Looking forward to going coming back here to try more items from the menu as they have a very extensive and varied list of sushi and maki."}
{"text":"The Quality of food is much better than Chinese run Japanese Sushi in Markham.  We ordered the Sushi Boat. (Fresh and nice display)   Services is good.  Friendly staff."}
{"text":"One star is only for the servers who were lovely. Sushi/sashimi, not so much. The sashimi was frozen & cut super thick. Even frozen it had an off taste to it. We had a couple of rolls that were not horrible but only because they had so much sauce on it we couldn't taste the fish.  Then they ran out of the sake that we started with. The final blow was the Japanese cheese cake. Where it should have been light & airy & served hot, it was cold & dense. Not a happy ending for a birthday dinner."}
{"text":"WOW! My family love Japanese food and have been to many, but this one is the best. The service and food is TOP Class at a low price. Not only is the food fantastic, the portion a big, too. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! TOP OF THE LIST!"}
{"text":"First encounter, friendly staff and clean space. So far so good! Ordered lunch take out and was pleased by the quality of the food. Wait time was average. Price is fair for the quality.  The miso soup was fresh, the little tofu cubes still have strong soy flavour, well done. The salad, which was actually green, appeared to have scratch made dressing, because I tasted fresh lemon juice in it, which is good!   The assorted sushi was clean, fresh, and well made, just the right amount of rice. The gyoza were in the small side and didn't taste great. I had to try the Tamago (egg) of course, it was decent, perhaps a little more on the savoury side and slightly less sweet would be good. Texture was decent. Tempura was perfect, and smartly packaged in a breathable box to keep from going soggy, clever!   Overall, a good sushi take out meal. I will go back for another lunch to try their other offerings."}
{"text":"Just had the white knight and King fire and it was the best sushi we have ever had! Absolutely phenomenal!!"}
{"text":"Ordered take-out from here on a Sunday night. Was ready for pick-up within 20 minutes of us calling! When we arrived, we were greeted by friendly staff. The restaurant looked very spacious and clean.  We got the Sushi Boat B which had a mix of sashimi, sushi and rolls. I really enjoyed the spicy caterpillar roll. The other roll (california type roll with shrimp tempura inside) was good too, but not as good as the spicy crab. Their rolls are the perfect size, with awesome rice to filling ratio (outside layer of rice not overly thick)= The sushi was really yummy - lots of raw fish ones, and two bbq eels (mmm so good!!). This came with miso soup and salad. The salad dressing was delicious - nice and lemony.  Only downsides were that some of the sashimi was cut really thick, and had the tendony things in it. I'd probably stick to just the sushi and special rolls next time. Yums!"}
{"text":"I was very happy with my sushi here, as were my dinner mates!  I had the tuna tartare maki and the spicy salmon. My friends really enjoyed the green salad and the volcano dish. Everything tasted very fresh and was reasonably priced.   However, I would probably suggest take-out rather than eating in. There are not many tables, and service was a bit slow."}
{"text":"It's OK. Got a lunch special for $9.14, tax included. It's your standard pre-made out of the fridge box.  Not bad, but also not freshly made... The place was pretty desolate at 2 pm on a Wednesday. They have a few tables and a bar for eating there but I got a feeling it's mostly a take-out place. Smelly bathroom :(."}
{"text":"The staff were very attentive and welcoming at Royal sushi :) The ambiance on Friday night was nice to have dinner after a busy week. The presentation on the sushi dish was nicely decorated on a long wooden rectangle board with a leaf. I enjoyed the 2nd time experience more than the first time when I was there for lunch."}
{"text":"First off.. very delicious and fresh sushi.  Also very clean, great service, and friendly servers.. we will become regulars!    We travel great distances for great sushi but now that Royal Sushi is in our neighbourhood we will be walking!  Kampai!"}
{"text":"It's a shame that this place closed because this was our new go-to place for sushi."}
{"text":"Do not go here to try ramen because you are feeling too lazy to go somewhere further. The broth was flavorless, the noodles were not very good, the pork was grey and bland. The other toppings mush. This is more of a takeout sushi joint. The sushi I tried was not bad, but one block down from this place you can get really great and fresh tasting sushi so just go there."}
{"text":"It's my first time. The interior is very cozy. Has different variety of sushi from many other places in the area. Quality of food and service is good."}
{"text":"Friend of mine recommended this place that was recently opened few weeks ago so my friend and I decided to give it a try on Sunday night. We shared a sushi boat and pot of warm sake.   It was amazing! The presentation look too beautiful to eat and sashimi, sushi and rolls tasted fresh and delicious. The service was attentive and we had a great time. Can't wait to go back for more sushi!"}
{"text":"Positive: Staff were friendly  Negative: -ordered a sashimi platter and one of their special Maki. Maki took forever to come out. We nearly finished the sashimi platter by the time Maki came out. -tiny appetizer salad and soup only comes with certain dishes whereas its usually a standard at most sushi places.  -I usually eat same thing every day unless Im eating out. My stomach was at war the next day, being in and out of the washroom the whole day. -The sashimi didnt look very fresh, and seems like they re-use the decorations (spiralizer carrots, beets...etc) since they look really dried.   Definitely NOT returning."}
{"text":"I had been to Royal sushi for lunch. I found it was quite standard in terms of food quality The service though really friendly.  It did have a lot of potential but sadly with all these sushi restaurants opening all over town, it is not easy to run a business."}
