{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing  for any time of the day, there breakfast is delicious, as well as their lunch,  and dinner. I would definitely recommend the poutine  here it's the best I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Have been waiting over 30 minutes for service. Only a dozen tables occupied and haven't seen a server come by. Can't review the food as we haven't had any. Breakfast restaurants are supposed to be quick at preparing eggs & toast. We cannot recommend this place"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE!!
 We went for breakfast here on Sunday morning about 9:00 am, we seat for about 15 min at a booth and never got service! There was about 4 other family's of about 4 to 6 people, it wasn't crazy busy. When I was able to get the attention of a waitress she told me in not a very nice tone that she would get to us when she had a minute, that never happened! When we left the hostess saw us never tried to apologize but rather continue her very funny conversation with the other 2 waitress. We really had goes off this place being GREAT!!"}
{"text":"Good service, but if you're a regular, great service. 
I definitely felt like an outsider. 
My omelette and potatoes were very good."}
{"text":"First time/last time customer...ordered fish & chips for dinner...not their finest...should be taken off the menu...fish was chewy and tasteless...expensive too...no value, bad experience, never again!"}
{"text":"Went to Angels twice recently. Great food. from breakfast to dinner the menu is full of great options. Their burgers are fantastic. Real ground beef with lots of flavor, not like other places that have processed patties. This is a burger you'll remember! The service has been friendly, fast and efficient even when the restaurant is really busy, well done to the staff!!!"}
{"text":"A great place for breakfast with lots of options and is consistently well cooked.  Portions are great.   Some dishes are excellent (smoked meat sandwiches, burgers, smoked meat spaghetti, wraps, soups) while others need some work (fish for the fish and chips is frozen and onion rings are from a bag).  It a good diner. Has the potential to be a great one."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! Everyone I was with agrees it was great food. The service was great too, employees seem very happy which makes a huge difference in the dining experience. Will definitely be returning"}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Has a lot of variety of food. The coffee is very strong and always being filled up."}
{"text":"Delicious!  We sampled four different breakfasts and were all very pleased.  Chicken fried steak was crispy and flavorful, \"Works\" bagel was a stuffed treat, green chili omelet was full of pork and chocolate chip pancakes were delish!  Food was served hot and with wonderful service - will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Found this place when looking for a breakfast spot that's not a traditional joint (like IHOP). Atmosphere was great, staff are nice, and food was good. Will be back again for sure"}
{"text":"Angel's has good food and good service. The eggs are fresh and delicious, the waffles are crisp yet tender, the sausage and biscuits are hearty and satisfying. It's locally owned and operated so let's support them!"}
{"text":"First time in this restaurant today. Service was really slow, and the food was very boring. This place has potential, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone with the service I got today. The line at black bear is where you'll find me for my next breakfast."}
{"text":"Best mexican food! I love taking my family there because it is super affordable and delicious."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this Angel's Diner in ages. I came recently and had the chicken tenders with fries and coleslaw. The chicken tenders here are not like your standard frozen chicken fingers at other chain restaurants. They are fresh breast meat coated in a batter. 

Usually the chicken tenders are super crispy and enjoyable. This time the coating was soft rather than crispy and looked darker than usual. I don't know if they changed the recipe, the oil was old, or the cook just screwed up. This was not up to the standards of the chicken tenders that I remember. The honey dijon dipping sauce was still as yummy as usual. 

The fries are standard frozen fries. I had thought they were handcut for some reason (I must have been confused with a different place) or I wouldn't have ordered them. I don't order frozen fries because they're a waste of stomach space. I wish restaurants would stop serving them. Unless you're a high school cafeteria, you have no reason to be serving frozen fries. Laziness is no excuse for poor food quality. 

I might come back to try the chicken tenders again with fingers crossed that the quality returns once again to the way it used to be."}
{"text":"We saw that Angels was open and checked the reviews. Looked pretty good so we came for breakfast the next day. Angels is spacious, comfortable and clean. The staff are friendly and attentive. Now to the food. My wife ordered the chicken fried steak, this is our benchmark that all diners are judged. She says that it is fantastic, you can cut it with a fork. I had the Tex Mex omelette with seasoned potatoes that compliment each other perfectly. We have found a new place close to home. Can't wait to try lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"I have been here at least 7 times and maybe once it was actually good.  Everything is over priced.  $7 for pancakes alone or $7 for two eggs is just outrageous!  

There is just something about it I don't like... one time a friend and I went and not once did we have the same serve help us or fill drinks or ask how our meal was.  It was not busy, it was 2pm on a Saturday and very quiet.  
Another time, a friend who once ran a restaurant was standing up making sure we got attention.  

We had a large party that could have been placed in the back but yet we were put right next to large group... it was a bit obnoxious.  

So each time someone suggests it... Nope, not interested!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place because the score and review was high.  I wish i didnt.  This is a typical dive diner but sub par to TJ's. 

I ordered 3 meats 3 eggs.  The english muffin was grilled, not toasted.  The eggs were ordered over easy but can with 2/3 of it raw with cold egg white.  I told the server who put in a new order for me but only brought me back 2 eggs over medium.  The bacon, sausage, ham and potatoes was good though the potato serving was  small.   I can get the same plate that would taste better at Denny's for a cheaper price."}
{"text":"Stopped by for takeout. Our server made sure we got our coffees right away

 Our breakfast was delish. 
 Service was great
 Homey diner with a retro touch
 
We definitely be back! 
Lots of great items on the menu!

Five stars guys"}
{"text":"Food: 4/5
Servers: 4/5
Food wait time: 3/5


First impression from the outside is not that great especially the surrounding area. Gets better once inside. Floor could use a makeover and they need to cool the place down a bit feels like 80 degrees get it down to 75 atleast.

 Overall good neighborhood diner and a good place to go when you are not sure what to eat for breakfast."}
{"text":"Excellent food, and the wait staff are very attentive and friendly.  This diner is large enough to seat over 100 people. Angel and her husband, Alfredo, are hands on owners who take pride in every aspect of their restaurant. This is the place to go for a good hearty meal. They are open for breakfast, lunch and dinner and the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Good food reasonably priced.  Friendly staff. 50s diner atmosphere."}
{"text":"Have not had a bad meal here. Tonight it was the All You Can Eat Taco Tuesday (tacos & cheese enchiladas with rice and beans). I paid a small upcharge to get chicken enchiladas (instead of cheese) with my tacos and everything was awesome.

Some of the best enchiladas and taco's I've had. They are deep fried hard shell taco's with your choice of meat.

Love trying new things here and look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Great family restaurant. All you can eat fish and chips! Fresh battered cod, grilled OR fried!  

Grilled shrimp taco salad with a lot of shrimp too! 

Love supporting individual owned small business!"}
{"text":"Took my son here and he loved it. Food was good and server was nice. I had pancakes and eggs, would go back to try something else."}
{"text":"Nice clean restaurant, friendly staff and fun atmosphere 50's style diner decor and milk shakes plus home style meals."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great staff and wonderful service. Definitely going to be coming back for lunch soon"}
{"text":"Over priced. Was disgusted at how the manager on duty treated the staff. Use low grade small eggs. Been once. Won't be back again"}
{"text":"Very welcoming, yummy comfort food at very reasonable prices. The staff are very friendly and the place is immaculate!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Service is perfect. Came here with my parents, grandmother, husband and two sons to start our Christmas vacation. Couldn't have done better."}
{"text":"Angel's Diner has become a regular stop for our family.  We eat there at least once a week, and we really enjoy the reasonably-priced, delicious meals. The menu is extensive with American and Mexican foods, sandwiches, breakfast items available all day, and lots of comfort foods.  They plan to offer a buffet once a month starting in August.  Angel's is always clean, and the staff is very friendly.  The owners are the sweetest couple--very accommodating!  Check 'em out!"}
{"text":"OMG!  The best  I ever  had, everything I ordered was delicious,  great service I definitely recommend"}
{"text":"I did not enjoy my breakfast at all. Did not the the frozen fried potatoes. The service was good. Have been there only once and would not go back. There are better breakfast places in town"}
{"text":"First time here. Breakfast was delicious. Server Laura was really sweet. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"ALL BAD decided to give this place a try since king egg roll next door was closed on Tuesday. Started off fine they sat me and my daughter. They had a taco Tuesday special 9.99 all you can eat. After waiting 25 minutes for my tacos to come out. Mind you hardly anybody was there. Plate comes out and it's just rice beans and two plain shredded beef tacos. Nothing special. Waitress comes back around after I'm done eating and I order another round of tacos. Tacos come out another 20 min later by this time I'm over it an hour in this diner waiting on just 6 tacos. The people all sitting at the other tables were all experiencing this frustration. After all was said and done I decided to leave before my second round of tacos came out. What's the point of all you can eat tacos if you have to wait so long to get them. They still made me pay my bill no discount after spending what seemed to be my evening in this place and voicing out my frustration with the waitress. Sucks when you feel ripped off and your the customer. A couple also walked out on this place before I left. Save your money go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast yesterday. First time there and the biscuits and gravy were awesome also had the Mexicana eggs which were very tasty   We will be back"}
{"text":"This is one of the best diners in AZ! Love coming here, the food is great, the staff is friendly, no ling waiting, and the price is just right. I recommend anyone in the West valley to come take a look."}
{"text":"Went with my wife to try this place on Sunday for brunch before taking her to the airport. We were met quickly and taken to a dirty booth. A young kid came over right away to clean it, but his dad was dirty and do it was not coming clean. Finally taken to another table to be seated. Unfortunately she was just the hostess as there must be some communication failure as a server did not come to us for quite some time.  I finally made eye contact with another employee who most of notified or server.  The server then came by and offered what I interpreted was a half hearted \"sorry for the wait\" and asked if we knew what we wanted. My wife said she would like some water. Yes, she acknowledge our delay in service but did not think to bring two waters with her. The server replied \"do you know what you want to eat?\" We have our order and she brought our water and coffee. About 10 minutes of conversation with my wife went by when another young fella came by to ask if anyone had taken our order, joking I had said yes, but I'm not sure where she took it. We all smiled. Hindsight, I guess I should have specifically asked him to check on our order.  After a while I've reached the end of my patience. I got the attention of another server and she in turn talked to our server who went to check on our order. Again some communication break down as the kitchen never got our order.  We finally got our food. I won't comment on the food because I'm sure my tastes were biased by the experience to this point. Our food was comped, but management never came to talk with us. Sad, because a friend once told me \"a bad experience is a chance to earn a lifelong customer.\" There were many of constructive feedback that could have been given to improve upon customer service with this experience, but no one asked. Even with plenty of time set aside for breakfast, we ended arriving to the airport 25 minutes behind schedule."}
{"text":"This place is tucked in the corner of the shopping plaza next to 99cent store. I stopped in a bit hesitant but what the heck. I was greeted and sat at the table I ordered hot tea and the waitress did not know whIch kind they had available so it wasn't very helpful in making a selection. I ordered the eggs lightly basted (which the chef was on Point!) I'm picky when it comes to my eggs. Ordered toast and half a biscuit and gravy. The gravy in my opinion was a \"no go!\" It was peppery and not tasty in my opinion. I know how to make sausage milk gravy from scratch and I would say pass on the gravy. Other than that cute establishment, great eggs, just didn't like the gravy! Happy Eats!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a breakfast place as we traveled across Arizona. A nearby restaurant had a line so we found this place on Yelp and decided to have a look.
It is a little further from the freeway but not hard to find.

The restaurant is very spacious with a lot of tables but doesn't feel crowded. Large windows give it a light airy feel. Decor is spare but interesting with murals and memorabilia.

We were greeted by very friendly servers at the front and taken to a booth right away. 
The server brought us waters and coffee quickly as is the fashion in America.
The coffee was excellent! THIS IS IMPORTANT! Most inexpensive restaurants go for the cheapest Farmer Bros. coffee available and thus fulfill their promise of serving \"coffee\". Their coffee is superb and makes the difference in the experience. We are not coffee snobs but the coffee that so many accept at Dennys, Dunkin Donuts and any number of roadside restaurants is a cruel hoax.
I noted that they claimed to make their pancakes and waffles from scratch. Figuring this to be a decent test of their basic skills I ordered the pancakes, 2 eggs and sausage breakfast. My wife ordered an egg white vegetarian omelette.
They came fairly promptly and I was delighted to see that the sausage patties were freshly cooked and not reheated, desiccated discs of pig. They were tender,juicy and hot from the griddle. Eggs were cooked perfectly and the pancakes were indeed light and delicious.
My wife was delighted with the veggie omelette that had green pepper, spinach and mushroom. Cooked perfectly.
Service was attentive with refills for coffee and water made promptly but not intrusively.

Breakfast is a funny meal to get right. It is seemingly simple but can be difficult to get right in a volume environment. Eggs and pancakes are very sensitive to timing and temperature and freshness is of the essence.

Angel's scored perfectly on all counts. The food was solid American breakfast perfectly cooked by a skilled kitchen crew and only enhanced by their great coffee.
On top of all this the price is very reasonable if bordering on too cheap.
Great food, delightful staff.Oh yeah, clean restrooms too."}
{"text":"We love going out for breakfast!  That said, I always try the corned beef hash on my first visit anywhere.  This one was fresh and juicy and plenty of it. My poached eggs were done well and the coffee was ok.  I'm tough to please on coffee, I love bold coffee and it's hard to find in a regular restaurant.  My husband tried the pancakes with scrambled eggs and cheese.  The pancakes were just ok and there was almost more cheese than egg.  The server, Shannon was exceptional and pleasant.  We will try another lunch or dinner there in the future.  I would recommend it."}
{"text":"We went here tonight with our neighbors.  Angel's is a keeper!!
The food was so good!  My husband ordered a Philly Steak Sandwich.  (We are from the Philly area, so we are very critical.)  It really was quite good.  My husband said that he would get it again.  I had the Reuben sandwich.  very good  The other couple ordered chicken fajitas that smelled fabulous coming out and she said it was delicious.  They also got a burrito.  The portions were of good size.  
As full as we were, we got and order of sopapillas.  There are four to an order.  They came out hot and fresh with a bowl of honey and a bowl of warm chocolate syrup.  
The service was wonderful!  Our server was very attentive.  Both Angel and Alfredo came out to talk to us.  They like to greet customers.  nice touch
Thank you, Angel's Diner.  You are a delicious go to place.
They serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Prices are good, servings a nice portion.  The restaurant is spotless."}
{"text":"They have amazing service and the waiter we had was super friendly they need to stay the way they are I am so happy with there food and service I want to go back and I will it is the best diner I have ever been to in ky life time they make me feel at home it is like I am family theirI hope they keep the waiters they have because I love everyone their."}
{"text":"Very happy with all of it. Food     
was great, restaurant was clean, and service was fast and friendly. Nice to find local place with local owners. Try it out"}
{"text":"Awesome diner. We saw their sign at a local Rotary Golf Outing so we thought we'd give it a try and support a local business. It was delicious. Coffee was excellent. The service was fast and friendly. The waitress gave us a first time discount. Would highly recommend this cute diner for a fabulous breakfast!!!  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Our first time here! We had there buffet and everything was so tasty and filling. What an awesome way to try a variety of foods. Satisfied with everything! We will definitely be back. Thankyou!"}
{"text":"Green chili con carne omelet was really good! Make sure you get some of their homemade salsa if they have some."}
{"text":"I have been to Angels a few times and i will never go back. My mother ordered liver and onions. The liver was saturated with fake gravy and they use frozen vegetables. The staff was nice enough however my order, was just adequate.  Not enough to make me go back."}
{"text":"Green chillies breakfast burrito was awsome ..  the pancakes wernt to shabby either lol..  I'll be back this was really good worth the wait . No people but the food took really long to be prepared and brought out . They get a pass tho. They clearly had a chief wanted sighn up."}
{"text":"I love diners. Angel's has a good selection of food (like most diners) but the food is lacking something. It's a little flat, bland, and lifeless. I've eaten at other locations and it wasn't as disappointing, but this one needs to do... I don't know... something."}
{"text":"Had a great experience at Angels Cafe.  Yaquelin was a server. Kind and friendly and efficient.   As for the food, it was fast and fresh and tasty too.  I tried bacon and egg burrito which was enough for two meals.  Husband and daughter had eggs n sausage breakfast meal. All good.  Can't wait to come back to try dinner!!
Love when I find a new place in town.....whoop!"}
{"text":"What an excellent place to eat! We go nowhete else in Georgetown for eat-in food. The service was instant by the really nice blonde haired waitress with the pony tail said she just brewed a fresh pot of coffee. We don't drink, so that suited us just fine. Hubby ordered the special 10oz  steak came with baked potato slaw and huge Caesar we shared. It was delicious. I had club wrap and fries. They were perfect. Generous portions. My meal was $11. I took half the wrap home i was so full. Hubby had the special which was probably $16. He's a generous tipper. I don't  know if it even came to $30 but he left a $50 bill.  We recommend it with pleasure. You won't be disappointed. And i'm hard to please when it comes to eating out."}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times, and it is always delicious.  Breakfast choices are great, 
lunch is great, and dinners (especially Mexican entrees) are the best  we have ever had.
So, if you want breakfast, lunch, or dinner, you can't go wrong here.  The owners and
entire staff are very friendly and efficient.  Great experience every time we go here!  Give
Angels a try - - you won't be sorry"}
{"text":"Just had the worst experience ever. Tried to take my dad out for an early father's day breakfast and waited 30 minutes and still didn't get any food. We only had someone check on us for drinks once. I tried to order an ice coffee they were advertising and the server said something was broken and brought me normal brewed coffee over ice. We left and stepped at TJs like we should have been in the first place. Tried to give them a shot but I didn't think it was possible to get service that bad."}
{"text":"One morning I was on my way to the .99 only store and stumbled across this diner. I was hungry and the name of it seemed to catch my eye so I was a bit curious. I went in and was immediately greeted by a very nice waitress. I ordered an egg and machaca plate then later noticed a guy eating menudo so I ordered that as well. The food has a taste of home made cooking and the atmosphere was very nice of a 50's look with diner music playing in the background. I must say the waitress was very nice and attentive making sure my drink was filled. I really like this place and would go back again."}
{"text":"Food was really good. I would give 5 stars for the food, 4 for the service. The food came fast, but the waitress must have been new. They lost our bill so that took a little time. The kids meals are around $5 each which is reasonable. The amount of food was just right but they don't come with drinks. The portion size of the adult meals was just right too. We didn't leave anything behind. We enjoyed the music that was playing and the decor was really nice. We will go back again. I recommend you try it out."}
{"text":"Wonderful breakfast from scratch with super fresh ingredients...Wait staff is very friendly and knowledgeable...Everything cooked to perfection...My Grandson said it was the best breakfast burrito he had ever had...Looking forward to returning for dinner"}
{"text":"On the back to Tucson from Vegas we found this diner that does both American and Mexican food, they do it well. Just stop in and you'll taste what I'm saying about this West Valley family run gem."}
{"text":"We were looking for a healthy meal. We got more! Clean, inviting, awesome hospitality, kindness and attention to detail. We were very happy with the food presentation and vegetarian choices. Owner willing to be flexibe and accommodating. The music was a mix of oldies giving this diner a classy relaxing touch. Thank you, we shall return, you should try this place."}
{"text":"This is a great new place. We need more independent Diners and coffee shops in Goodyear! We ordered the meatloaf dinner and the steak fajitas.  The mashed potatoes and retried bean were homemade and very good! Nice portions and the atmosphere is very comfortable. New tables and booths. We will definitely be back! 4 stars instead of five only because the food took a little longer than usual to come out but worth the wait!"}
{"text":"My wife & I decided to go here for brunch today. I had looked up on Google and saw the excellent reviews for Angels Diner. We felt welcomed as soon as we entered and sat down. The food was excellent and the customer service was excellent as well. We will definitely be back soon:)."}
{"text":"Our first time here this morning. Ambience is nice, food was really good. And service was nice. I like how everyone was cheerful and helpful. I got the works sandwich with cottage cheese and wife got the egg Benedict. Both were surprisingly really good. I personally like to support small family owned business and glad we came here. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Food was just okay honestly a bit overcooked, service wasn't great either and we had some food residue floating in our cups. Server also spilled water all over the floor and table while trying to pour water out of the side of the pitcher. She only cleaned the floor and left our table wet. Maybe I'll give them another chance for breakfast but for lunch it's a no go."}
{"text":"Great dinner in Georgetown, smoked meat sandwich and burgers are so huge and tasty. You get a ton of food at the is place at a great price. Been 3 times and always had a awesome meal. Always look forward to a meal here"}
{"text":"I have been here 2 times. I have been ok with both visits. They serve diner food breakfast lunch and dinner. American and Mexican food.  Not to fond of the Mexican food. If you have had really good Mexican food elsewhere yes you will compare it to that and wish you did go there. Breakfast menu is good. What I like about this place is that it's not crowded and you are not waiting in long lines. It also has a cozy feel good atmosphere and friendly waitresses.  Prices are average. That's why I would compare to other places. Note I don't think that the gravy is the real deal. But that's just me and I have had some good gravy. My husband said chorizo tasted like the cheap rolled one you buy at the store for 1.00. Um no thank you. I did notice that a lot of people come here. I seen regulars and just customers roll in during my visit. So they do have a fan base. Will I be back probably but for something different."}
{"text":"This was a terrible lunch! I ordered the Hot Hamburger Sandwich. The meat was clearly reheated, the bread was simple white bread with the crust cut off. I asked for the fries well done so they simply took already fried fries & refried them again. The coleslaw was disgustingly sweet. Not sure what they did there?? 

The server \"Pat\" was less then engaged. Missed multiple requests for a coffee refill, missing knives on the table, missed napkins refills. Just a poor level of service all the way around & the place was not even very busy. To top it all off the mustard bottle was disgustingly dirty & the ED Smith ketchup was just as bad. 

This is my 2nd & last trip to this place...do yourself a favour...eat at a different restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great homemade corn tortillas. Loved the beans. The potatoes could have been cooked more. I'm definitely trying it again. Maybe huevos rancheros next time."}
{"text":"We always go over to Angels for breakfast. The food is pretty good and it really has the diner feel. The ladies room is old and needs updating but it is clean. The staff are friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!! As you wait Home made corn tortillas!! The menudo was incredible as was the steak ranchera and green chili con carne omelette was FIRE, as is the rice and beans ! No matter where you are in the valley take the drive it is completely worth it."}
{"text":"My wife and I live nearby and are very impressed with this new addition to the community. We have tried a variety of meals from Huevos Rancheros to the Pork Chops. Servers and the owners are prompt and friendly. Food is great, real mashed potatoes and a really good breakfast."}
{"text":"Great food variety of food to choose from all tasting great!!! Recommend this place tortilla are hand made!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped by here because of the great reviews and we were sorely disappointed. We both ordered breakfast, I had the works with potatoes and my boyfriend got a waffle with a side of biscuits and gravy which came with 2 eggs and 1 slice of ham. After waiting 30 minutes for them to cook our meal they gave us cold biscuits and gravy. My sandwich was essentially flavorless and my potatoes were both undercooked and almost completely naked of seasoning. My boyfriend's waffle was completely overcooked as well with it becoming hard as a rock. I'd like to say the service was good but the server we had was very inattentive and often times I waited on him to return.

Definitely won't be back. Wasn't a good meal in the slightest. Would have rather ate at Dennys."}
{"text":"Checked out this place yesterday with the family. I heard it was a pretty good diner and the reviews here made me finally go here. 

The place was pretty clean and the staff was pretty friendly. The decor was nice and I enjoyed the 50's pictures and things. But it was down hill from there.

I'll write everything that was ordered.

Avocado burger: sounded good and it was a let down. The bun was dry. The patty looked and tasted like a frozen patty from Walmart. Avocado was at least fresh and the avocado sauce didn't have much flavor to it. Rate it 2 out 5 stars.

Create your own plate: My wife ordered this and it was very bland for Mexican. The beans looked like the were refried like 4 or 5 times on how dark they were. Rice didn't even taste good. The machaca was a complete joke, it was just meat! That's all! Where was everything else that goes with it? This was by far the worst attempt at anything Mexican I've ever seem. 

Create your own plate: My mother inlaw ordered the same thing as my wife. Same review as above.

Kids meal: chicken tenders with fries. Nothing special here or to write about.

I don't think Ill give this place a second chance to redeem itself. Maybe I should have come here for breakfast, but I'll never know now...."}
{"text":"Great breakfasts, comfort food and Mexican food. Clean restaurant and wonderful staff.  Friendly and a good bargain. Very reasonable prices and large portions. I highly recommend the fajitas or the corned beef omelette. Breakfast served all day."}
{"text":"Very good service.  Very clean.  Nice diner atmosphere.  Burger was very good.  Fries excellent.  Mom had a chile relleno she said best in Arizona!! Beans are homemade and Spanish rice is very good!!!  Must try this diner!"}
{"text":"Came here for some take out. I elected to go with the soy chorizo burrito. For being a vegan burrito I was very pleased with it. The homemade salsa was a great touch. I'll be returning to see how their salsa pairs with the street tacos they offer."}
{"text":"Generally trustworthy place for simple family meals. Good breakfast selections and standard sandwiches and \"family meals\" for lunch and dinner.  I got \"upgraded\" on my breakfast without being fully aware of the cost impact.  \"Do you want Swiss cheese with that ...etc.\".   Great cup of coffee and servers are quite pleasant - like being served by mom."}
{"text":"I love this place! It is super spacious and has a 50's diner decor going on. The breakfast is great and my eggs are always cooked to perfection. The workers are always super nice and attentive. My family and I love coming here for breakfasts. They have your traditional breakfast menu and they also have Mexican breakfasts. Both have been good from our experience."}
{"text":"Been here three times, have only tried the Mexican food, and it is delicious and authentic!!  Always very clean and the staff and owner are always very kind.  Please give them a try, well worth it!!"}
{"text":"We saw this place on our way to the Pancake Factory and came back to it when we got to the Pancake Factory and found out the wait will be 45mins. Angel's was awesome.  It's spacious with lots of seats so we didn't have to wait. The service was fantastic...friendly and attentive. We ordered the Angel Omlette and it was fantastic. The kids had pancakes and they were huge and very fluffy and tasty. Their portions are generous and offers great value. They decor is a typical diner style...very comfortable. I would diffinately come again."}
{"text":"Really slow service and a long wait on food that wasn't the most tasteful food I've personally had. Toast was burnt seemed like charcoal ordered butter and finished food before it ever got back to us maybe if it wasn't for the slow service would of been a decent place"}
{"text":"With an imminent move to the area within the year, my partner and I have been making an effort to try to explore our dining options every time we visit Georgetown. We've heard generally positive things about Angel's Diner, so we decided to give it a go. It was relatively dead when we entered save for one table consisting of a family of four, and another couple who were arriving at the same time as us. We were seated fairly quickly and were handed menus that were about 3-4 pages long. 

My boyfriend decided to order the Original All Day breakfast which consisted of eggs, bacon, home fries and some fruit. I ordered the chicken tenders and we agreed to split the deep fried pickles... because deep fried pickles are the best way to eat pickles.

...And it was the best decision we've ever made. These might be the best deep fried pickles we've ever had and the dill ranch dip was incredible. 

The chicken tenders were not as crunchy as I was anticipating BUT I recognize this was likely due to it being a wet batter as opposed to a panko/breadcrumb base. Still plenty of flavour and proper seasoning. The tenders came with a honey dijon mustard and bean based BBQ dipping sauce. I do not like honey dijon mustard. I do not like beans, never mind beans in a bbq sauce.
