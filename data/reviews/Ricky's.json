{"text":"Normally I'm a fan of Ricky's but not at this location. Portions are so tiny I wasn't even remotely full. Service was beyond slow and the server was snappy and decently rude. On top of that she seemed to have way too many tables to have to deal with. Clearly a sign of terrible management. 

TL;DR don't go here if you want a meal that's filling or will arrive in under an hour."}
{"text":"We have eaten at Ricky's for many years. Normally the breakfasts were decent. On November 28, we had the worse breakfast ever. The eggs were cooked in rancid oil...it smelled so bad that we did not eat them. The coffee was just warm and terrible. During the course of our meal our server was screaming in the kitchen...very disturbing. Needless to say we will never dine at Ricky's again."}
{"text":"For the classic old school greasy spoon breakfast this place can't be beat. It is what it is."}
{"text":"My partner and I came here with a Groupon for breakfast. There were three choices and we both opted for the chicken and waffles. The waffles were among the best I've had and the chicken was also very good. Our waitress was fantastic - attentive and sweet. The food arrived within 10 minutes of ordering. My biggest qualm is that it's relatively pricy for what you get - we paid over $3 for each of our regular fountain drinks, and most things on the menu are $15+ for what I would assume is pretty standard fare."}
{"text":"Yet another place to avoid to eat at during holiday season (Nov-Dec) or if you are planning to see a show at the Jubilee. Arrived there before 6pm,  the place was practically empty except for a private room where there was a Christmas work party.  Got seated after a while,  put in our drinks and food order, I believe 6:50pm arrives and still no food but 1 drink.  We have a show to see at the Jubilee at 7:30pm. We never got our food. We had to leave.  
When we left, the server apologized because they were short staffed because a server did not show up to work and the other server was tied up in the private party, when we left, another group left as they also were seeing the same show we were seeing at the Jubilee and couldn't get any food.  The server then put the close sign up as the restaurant could not serve the people who weren't part of the Christmas party.  
Really really appalling.  Shame on management for not bringing in more staff on an event night at the Jubilee.  Some people did not want to wait in line at Chilli's so they came to Ricky's.  Lose lose situation.  Frankly, if you are planning to choose Ricky's you're better off going to the food court next door.  Cheaper and you'll actually get your food in time for your show."}
{"text":"If there is a penance for all the good food I eat in Alberta, it's probably being dragged kicking and screaming into Ricky's on occasion.

Bad food and bad service tends to be the hallmark of this restaurant chain whether you're eating in Calgary or Edmonton or Red Deer (the only 3 places I regularly visit in Alberta, but I'm wiling to gamble they're the same in other towns).

So imagine my surprise when... my waitress was friendly?? Seriously, I was here for a breakfast meeting on Saturday and the staff were great - constant top ups on water, coffee and tea, gave us plenty of time to order,  got all the orders right , never appeared hassled despite how incredibly busy the place was. 

The food was still completely disgusting and irritated my delicate little stomach (I'm such a wimp) but they do get points for having a really good Earl Grey tea which was especially appreciated in -20 weather when I was expecting the choices to be either coffee or Red Rose tea (ick and double ick).

So, this one gets a full star more than my last review of a Ricky's, and I'd even go up to 2.5 stars if that was possible. 

It's a miracle (that, or the Christmas season is finally getting to me. Bah Humbug)!"}
{"text":"Decided to stop in today for supper and it was fantastic! I had the meditteranean chopped salad - Yum! - fresh ingredients and really nice dressing flavors. Someone else had the bltc salad - also really good. The 3rd person had the prime rib sandwich and it was exceptional. We were so surprised as we haven't eaten there before and didn't know what to expect. The server was friendly and attentive. All in all a fantastic experience and we'll be back for sure. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I'm always struggling to find a good breakfast joint. And having lived in the States, I find myself often experiencing IHOP withdrawal.

Last weekend a good friend of mine suggested that we meet for brunch at Ricky's. I hadn't been in a few years and am always game when there is food involved. We headed over to the one by North Hill mall, on 16th Ave.

The restaurant itself was laid out nicely and I appreciated the decor. It was pretty busy, but then again it was 10am on a Saturday morning.

I ordered their veggie omelette and my friend ordered some type of strawberry delight waffle. The omelette was not the best omelette I've ever had, but I am picky when it comes to my eggs. It was a little too greasy for my taste and the filling could have used a lot more flavour.

The portion was big, which was a relief because I was famished, but overall it was not as satisfying as I would have liked.

The price was decent but I wouldn't have minded paying a bit extra for a better brunch. All in all, I'm still on the hunt for a hot-spot breakfast joint in Calgary. Stay tuned."}
{"text":"Me and my husband went here this morning around 10am before hitting the road back to Edmonton. The restaurant is basically across the street from where we were staying, so it was 100% convenient for us.

The restaurant had a few occupied tables but wasn't busy. We were seated right away, brought menus right away, and got our orders taken right away. Our food was brought out.... right away! Our waitress, Joelle, was friendly, relaxed and did her job to the tee. 

I only scanned the menu quickly before deciding what I wanted, but they had two full pages of breakfast and the prices are reasonable. I got one egg, two pieces of bacon, hashbrowns and toast for $5.95. The \"scrambled\" eggs were kind of weird as I thought they just looked like a wavy, sliced up omelette, but no matter. They still tasted the same. The hashbrowns were nice, not undercooked like some places, and the bacon was actually really good! I was pleased overall with my whole meal."}
{"text":"We came quarter to 12 on Mother's Day and were sat in 10 minutes. Un heard of!! Got our food pretty quickly for this day too! We even got a booth! And it wasn't too loud in there either. This is nearly impossible to find at that time on a weekend, never mind Mother's Day.

The food was fantastic! Scrambled eggs were way better than any other breakfast place I've been to. Stuffed French toast was the best breakfast I've had. Totally serious.

Very nice decor for a breakfast place.

One star off for being on the expensive side. Sides are particularly expensive.

I used to work in a different breakfast place. This is way better food, and far better service. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Sunday morning, after a couple birthdays we were on the hunt for breaky. Being that it was 10am on Sunday, we all know how this works out. 

Originally stopped at Dairylane and was told there was a 45 minute wait, I have 3 really hung over friends that need grease, this isn't going to fly. So we headed up to Phil's which is usually ok, nope it was also a zoo. Then Ricky's got mentioned. Alright sounds good. 

We got there, were able to get a table no problem. Being a celiac life gets interesting at these places, cuz as much as I would love to devour a stack of waffles, it won't be happening. 

I went an omelet which was good and some hash browns. I was feeling fine that day so the need for greasy breakfast was a loss for me. Decent food, cheap prices and it was quick. So if you need breaky stat, or are over the age of 60 definitely check it out."}
{"text":"Ricky's is someplace that I would recommended for standard fare for breakfast or brunch. They've got a great selection of bennies where you can basically top it up with your own selections or the standard with shaved ham. There are waffles and pancakes that look pretty decent. According to my friend the pancakes are good. I've only had the standard breakfast of eggs and bacon and their bennies and no complains there. The lunch/dinner menu is uninteresting. The prime rib looked really appealing in the photo and they claim that it is roasted in-house. This is probably true but I had the prime rib on Saturday and it was obviously leftover from Friday and reheated in a fry pan so definitely give it a miss. The service was good. They missed an order of chicken wings so made up for it by giving my friend a couple of extra but the wings are pretty dry and the flavours obviously just dumped on top of fried wings so I would not recommend the wings either. Another friend had the fish and chips and they looked outstanding but they used frozen fish so the batter ended up pretty soggy because of all the extra moisture frozen fish has. Bottom line, go for the items on the breakfast menu and you should be pretty happy."}
{"text":"B - List. Good food. Good service. Shopping and a bit hungry? This is a no hassle place to rest and have a bite."}
{"text":"Where do I start. Incredibly slow service. They forgot to bring my daughter her meal after everyone else had their food (I use the term food loosely as I have no idea what arrived on my plate). Waitress took 30 minutes to pour 3 glasses of water. Like come on its really not that hard when the place is rather deserted.  Now the food. Or lack there of. 3/4 orders wrong and honestly the roast beef tasted like borderline rotten lunch meat out of snackables. Stomach is still not settled. Gravy was powder and quite awful, mashed potatoes were instant and gross. Even the eggs were questionable. The only thing they got right was my drink. Never going back. Very poor excuse for food."}
{"text":"Oh boy. Here we go. 

I live right by this location so I'd like to think of it as a go-to in a pinch but those hopes and dreams have been shat on quite profusely by this location. 

I usually dig Ricky's food when I'm hungry and when I actually get fed at this place, I'm often satisfied. Key word being IF I get fed. With consistently only one server on staff at all times, whether it's a packed Wednesday night from the senior apartment next door spilling out for their meal or a busy Sunday morning, I've only ever seen one server working. Ever. The owners of this location must be horrendously, inexcusably cheap to only ever have one employee working at a time, especially during busy times. I have a very hard time believing everyone but one person calls in sick every single day.

I went tonight with a friend and I think it was probably the last time I'll ever go. We waited to be seated at the front for about 10 minutes (the restaurant wasn't full, we were just being ignored). We sat at our table for a good 25 minutes before the server bothered coming over to take our order. For being the only server on that night, she was moving pretty slowly with a very \"I don't really care\" attitude about her. Not terribly friendly. Also, not surprising since she was the only person serving a (surprisingly) busy restaurant. At that point we said we just wanted the bill and took off down the street to Denny's, which seemed to be the only place that wasn't full. 

If this location hired more people so you didn't have to wait half an hour just to order, I'd definitely go back. But I don't see that happening anytime soon; it's been like this for quite awhile now and it really is a shame, because it's in a great location and big enough to have potential."}
{"text":"I like Ricky's in general because they serve breakfast pretty much all day. The problem with this location is the service, or lack thereof. They do not care for a waiting customer if it isn't in their section, or part of their duties. One of the servers I got was a little slow and didn't know much about the special. No one does double duty here. As for food it is acceptable. I've been craving french toast as of late and Ricky's is one of the few that does them normal. Normal as in, not stuffed with dessert or topped with extra stuff I don't feel like eating. The kid's menu is extensive with lots to choose from. I get the cheese pizza for my little one and it comes with a free juice or milk. It also includes cookies and toy, but that's only if the server even remembers to give it to you. Service 2/5. Food 3/5."}
{"text":"Came here right at 12 to catch lunch with the bf. Parking was super difficult to find close to the restaurant as this location is attached to Northhill mall. 

There was no host at the door to greet me. I waited a good five minutes before one of the servers were able to seat me. I requested for a table a little further from the door as it was quite cold. Which she kindly turned me down for as she wasn't sure which tables were okay to sit at that moment. Fine. I'm not a trouble maker, so I have now wrapped my sweater closer to my body. It's going to be a quick lunch anyways. 

This is one of the cleaner locations I have been to. It's also lit brightly and the menus aren't sticky from past patrons. There are alot of menu specials throughout the day as well. 

Service is slow though. It has now been a full 20 minutes since we were sat and the server has just taken our orders... My tummy is starting to rumble at this point. At 1238 we recieve our food. Time to dig in! 

The foods not too bad at all. My eggs benny was perfectly cooked. If you don't mind the wait times it's a good place to go for brunch. Their host seems to go missing though... Throughout the whole meal I think he only sat two tables, with the servers doing a majority of the work. Will be back again some time as I have a hankering for some chicken and waffles."}
