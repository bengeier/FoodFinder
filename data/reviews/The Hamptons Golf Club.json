{"text":"We recently went to hit a bucket of balls and ended up staying for a glass of wine on the patio.  Beautiful spot.  Food looked good."}
{"text":"Played this course today after discovering it is NOW OPEN TO THE PUBLIC! The greens were fast, fairways are manicured but on the long side, the second cut and rough were very playable. Traps were well maintained and fun to play out of but the course is designed for the serious golfer and not your week-end \"duffer\"! You have to be able to move the ball with a fade and draw to score well on this track. Cost was like $120 with a cart, on paths only, but I've played comparable courses in the US for $200+. Recommend you walk and carry your bag and cost is like $90. Had a great lunch afterwards in the clubhouse on the 2nd floor seated outside, great views, Would definitely play again."}
{"text":"The Hamptons Country Club is a private golf course / country club in the city's NW.  It also rents the space out for dinners and other events.  I was recently here for a Christmas party reception and dinner, so my review will pertain to that aspect of their business rather than the golf club part.

The venue itself was large and welcoming.  They have a lot of interesting art - from paintings to blown glass and other eclectic pieces.  During the cocktail reception, it was fun to walk around socializing and check everything out.  At the bar, they had a respectable selection of 8-10 types of beer (bottles / cans), which is better than a lot of pubs in the city.  Most were imports or craft brews rather than the larger commercial beers which seem to be standard.  They definitely get bonus points for featuring beer from Calgary's newest brewery, Village.  For the wine drinkers, they also had a decent selection - 2 whites and 2 reds.  They even recommended 1 white and 1 red which were paired with the canapes during the reception and 1 white and 1 red which were recommended depending on your choice of main for dinner.

The wait staff during the reception were very attentive.  They wandered around frequently offering 2 hot appetizers: almond coated chicken skewers and arancini.  They also had a table of cold items which you could help yourself to.  There was a large tower of prawns as well as a selection of 5-6 cheeses, crackers, and fruits.  It was a decent spread, and it is a good thing we were too busy talking to overly fill ourselves up on all this food to start!

The dinner was also well done.  Prior to the event, each guest selected a beef, fish or vegetarian option for their main course.  Our name tags were color coded so that the staff could serve the meal that you had selected.  We started with an apple & frisee salad, followed by a potato and leek soup.  Next, we had a palate cleanser of lemon ice.  I had selected the sablefish which was served with pea puree, risotto and roasted vegetables.  It was really well done.  I find that often plated meals for a large group end up cold or overcooked and dry.  Not this time!!

Overall, I would definitely recommend The Hampton's Country Club as a good venue to host a dinner event!

{"text":"The Hamptons Country Club is a private golf course however when I was there, I noticed they were selling memberships and over heard that the pricing was very reasonable by some golfers? Not sure about this since I am not an avid golfer nor am I familiar with golf memberships.

The grounds are beautifully manicured and a very tranquil atmosphere is the first thing I noticed. I arrived for an event, so didn't partake in any golf however it was busy with golfers.

Inside the building it is modern and clean. Took a walk around before heading to the event on the 2nd floor. Great views and everything was so green and well maintained.

The space the event was held in was open, lots of windows and once again, even better views from the second floor. The room looked a bit dated, but then again it may have been the carpet?  They even had a deck overlooking the course, which was lovely. The food was appetizers and on one table as self-serve. The food was good and some things were just ok. Things like veggies, mixed salad, chicken skewers all in small portions however the small bite size desserts were great. Everything from mini tarts, squares and cookies. As for the service, since all the food was self-serve and I didn't see any person, I didn't experience any service except when I went to the bar to buy a drink. Bartender was nice but since it was a very limited bar (wine and beer only) I didn't get to experience any other cocktails that a bartender would normally make. A bit disappointing.

My review only pertains to that aspect of event space, catering and food service rather than the golf club part."}
{"text":"Not for beginners. Just inches off the fairway is grass so long and dense that you'll never find your ball. Not worth the exorbitant green fees and the drive."}
{"text":"Was there for an event so my review only pertains to the ballroom/event space kitchen and staff.  Our food was very well prepared and was above par when compared to other golf course kitchens.

My issue was with our wait staff.  We had to continuously ask for more water 2-3 times before getting it.  We were supposed to have wine with dinner.  Every other table received it without asking but we were missed.

We asked if coffee or tea would be served with dessert and our server said she would go find out (really?!?) ... a few minutes later we noticed other people getting coffee and tea except our table.

I think overall it is a great place to have an event.  It seems we were just unlucky in our wait staff."}
