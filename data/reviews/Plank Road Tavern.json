{"text":"A step above the random Lakewood bars as far as decor and menu. The food is not gonna blow you away, but count on it being better than many local bars. They have solid vegetarian options and great daily specials. I've never ordered food at a table, but have had drinks while ordering food at the bar a few times and my bar-service was top notch. They have a great beer list and during the warmer months, the patio is pretty big and offers free cornhole. The inside has free shuffleboard. It's seemingly more a bar than restaraunt, but I've met the owner, and he's a great guy. He remembers regulars and treats them well. It's also important to note that if their kitchen is closed, they don't mind if you order a pizza or something somewhere else and eat it there as long as you are still buying drinks."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar.  Great place to watch basketball.  Every Thursday they have a group of musicians playing Irish music."}
{"text":"Well... My black bean burger was delish! The bartender was very hospitable. But they could scheduled the construction and drilling at a more appropriate time. A bit disruptive! Ouch!  I love this place!  it is my home away from home, from home.  It smells like an invitation to vocal freedom in here.  Highly recommended!!! Go here and be free!  I come here all of the time!!"}
{"text":"Not sure how helpful Yelp is if people are knocking this establishment. The only \"bad\" service I had there was when it was so crowded that the staff could not keep up with the pleased patrons. As a picky eater who enjoys good solid meat and potatos food, I have thoroughly enjoyed the burger and have not been able to leave without ordering an extra order of the fries. The sausage board is fantastic. Several friends ordered the Chorizo burger and loved it. All the toppings and sides especially the garlic aoli are fantastic. As a side note the wife loves the Peachtini, feel free to order it off menu."}
{"text":"The best! Never too crowded, great beer & menu. Patio area for summer nights, and you can bring your dog on wednesdays"}
{"text":"Great bar atmosphere, awesome service and the most delicious chicken burger I've ever had!!  Try 5$ martini night on Tuesdays!! Super selection, both sweet and savory. The patio is awesome on a warm summer night."}
{"text":"Nicest bartenders around. Great place to watch a game or to grab a couple drinks with friends."}
{"text":"Plank Road Tavern in one of my favorite Lakewood hangouts. I especially love their large array of craft beer selections. The Columbus Bodhi is one of my favorites. I really like taco Wednesdays! The Margaritas are mixed well and for 3$ what else can you ask for! The tacos aren't the usual ground beef choice but a flavorful selection of vegetarian, chicken or steak. Service is always friendly :-) thanks Plank Road for providing a fun place to hang out with great beer!"}
{"text":"We are sitting in the back corner.  The atmosphere is nice, Cavs game is on.  We ordered Wednesday $2 tacos - 1 chicken, 1 beef.  Flame warmed flour tortillas! The best! If you like this style of tortilla try them at Bomba tacos in Rocky River. Chicken is grilled, cut into thin strips, topped with shredded cheddar cheese, and pico de Gallo.I make better tacos at home. I asked for barbecue sauce because they only had Tabasco, added it to the taco with the Tabasco and it was almost like Touch Taco Truck tacos, or what I like to call \"drunk tacos.\"  Come here, eat here, come back."}
{"text":"Kind of embarrassed to say that last night was my first time at PRT. Wife and I have walked to Dairy Queen a number of times saying \"we should go there sometime\".  Finally did on a rainy Monday night (drove, though).  Can't say that it was any one thing, but really a great place to grab a really good burger (or chicken sandwich).  Very reasonably priced (especially on Mondays), and great beer selection. One of those places where they apparently know how to maintain the beer and taps, too. Service was great, and it has that genuine, every-man vibe that you expect in a Lakewood establishment. Go before someone changes something."}
{"text":"My first time here, and I was not impressed.  Just a typical bar.  Though they had a decent selection of beers, I was looking forward to Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale based on another review, and they had Kentucky Bourbon Coffee variety, which I didn't like.  Stuck with Strongbow in a can, especially after I noticed how dirty the floors were.  The bathroom and the floor along the bar looked like no one had mopped it in a month or so.  It was extraordinarily warm inside, to the point of being uncomfortable.  It was 30 degrees outside, but I could have easily worn a tank top and been fine.  Service was ok, but nothing made me want to come back here rather than any other bar."}
{"text":"I used to go here every Wednesday for Happy Hour and I loved it BUT not any longer something has happened? My last 3 visits have not been good or favorable and my friends who were with me actually complained to the owner. The service is not so friendly and the bartender has a personality of a fly! Sorry but it's true...it does not seem as though that she enjoys what she does. The outdoor patio area is nice & large and they offer corn hole. Patio service is very slow and if there is only one bartender that shift you can not get patio service. NOW THE KICKER! THE FOOD!! :-( I used to love the tacos, fried green tomatoes, and french fries. Well they must have a new cook because on these last 3 visits there has been no consistency, the fries were so burnt that I had to send them back, the tacos were hardly full and the tomatoes had little flavor. I am disappointed and am looking for a new Wednesday Happy hour joint in LKWD. With LKWD having so many bars and food joint this pace could be in trouble!"}
{"text":"The wood plank floors and Christmas lights make for a cozy neighborhood bar where everybody knows your name.   The service is off the charts - the bartenders are very attentive and always recommend the best shots.   It's classy AF. So many young professionals.   Good spot to watch a Browns game. Rowdy yet tasteful.   Live Irish band on Thursdays. Real Irish music.   You can't go wrong drinking here!"}
{"text":"Welp, Yelp. I called here as I strolled near. They claimed \"best tots round here.\"  They were right! I found a barkeep with a name so dear....Nicholas Joseph, don't you fear!  The beer selection was okay, but they didn't have my favorite ros√©. The tots were most likely frozen, but it was a place we had already chosen. Thanks to Nick we kept on rollin."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and a great beer selection, but the food was pretty bland/unimpressive.  A group of us got several rounds of drinks, taking over multiple tables but sharing the room easily with a couple of families (before 9pm) and other patrons - it didn't get too packed for a Friday night. Excellent beer list and the bar seemed well-stocked too.   The ground chicken sandwich did not live up to its billing as having 'all the flavor of a Ceaser salad' as it had... no real flavor. The appetizers ordered (fried green tomatoes, fried pickles) were pretty small portions for the price and weren't greasy, but weren't particularly good.  Overall, I'd go there to drink on occasion, but not to dine."}
{"text":"Best burger in all of Lakewood. Awesome staff. Beer selection is ok. Very easy to ring up the tab here. Very relaxing enviroment. I find myself always wanting to have just one more here."}
{"text":"I came here once before, I thought the food was pretty good. Definitely not what I was expecting from such a small bar. We had a bunch of their menu items, fries, sausages, calamari and I want to say we had pierogies too. I would order them all again. This place had a great vibe and is owner operated. I drank liquor, so I can't speak on the beer and wine selection. They also have a private patio in the back, which I really liked. I parked at the fast food restaurant next door and I didn't get a ticket, there is no parking lot. It's just not my crowd, but I would go back with a group maybe."}
{"text":"I really wasn't entirely impressed the two times I went here. But, it could all be based on the circumstances, so I haven't completely ruled out coming again. I didn't eat either time, so I can only speak for the drinks and service.   My first time was utterly frustrating. I came with two boys and the female bartender seemed to think they were the only people that needed beer that night. I don't know if she was one of those sexist female bartenders (yes, they exist, I know it's strange to hear--my boyfriend had a really hard time believing what I was saying) or if she just thought I didn't look thirsty....either way. I definitely drink my beer slower than the boys, so I'm already at a disadvantage, so when I got my beer halfway through theirs, it was almost not worth it.   That being said, the beer selection seems pretty good!   My second visit was better because I wasn't the only girl, got to put an order in with everyone else and had an overall good time. The problem this time: misspellings on the chalkboard \"specials\" wall. I got completely distracted from the group for a bit because the board had some poor grammar on it (the curse of the English major...sorry.), so when I went to rub out the unnecessary apostrophes, some ladies sitting nearby gave me the stink eye and almost jumped out of their seats to stop me. Come on, guys! I'm helping everyone involved!   So, despite some common grammar mistakes and poor service one night, I'm not opposed to returning, but it's not on the top of my list. I really do want to try the food, though."}
{"text":"five-star! Good staff, local ingredients, and very wide range of beer. I always feel like I'm welcome. while here."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner to get a burger with my guy and sat at a table. The service was great. We had a really nice guy who serviced us, he had pretty good knowledge of craft beers and recommended a few good ones. The burger was good. I like the option to build your own with several interesting combinations available. My burger was a little dry but not bad. The fries were kind of flavorless. Overall not a bad meal. However the music was awful. The regulars were pretty crass and loud. They were pretty wild considering it was only about 6 pm. We put a few bucks in to play some songs but it was already overloaded with the crap they requested. Kidd Rock and Danny Boy wasn't my idea of some good music to listen to while eating. I'd be totally willing to go back and give it another try. Not too pricey either. The building it was in was very cool with dark wood beams and old fashioned looking light bulbs with visible filaments. I like the vibe, just not the regulars."}
{"text":"Meh...  This bar attracts a random crowd. The good news is they have Mckenzie's cider on draft...good stuff.  But other than that, I don't think I would go out of my way to go to this bar.  It is a standard, 3-star, neutered personality bar.  There are way more interesting and fun bars to spend time in than Plank Rd..."}
{"text":"All of the bartenders are good-looking and super attentive. The food is expertly crafted and is consistently delicious. Each night boasts different events and specials, and it is the ideal spot for any craft beer lover. The place also has a humongous patio where one can enjoy their cigarettes with their extravagant beers and best friends."}
{"text":"A+ Bar food in Lakewood.  The burger was amazing! Exactly the way I asked for it to be cooked too.   This is no scrawny little patty either.   The dry rub chicken wings were freakin amazing,so were the hand cut french fries.  The staff was super friendly, they had my order done in 15 min.   For the same price as a trip to Five Guys, I got a better tasting, big fat cheeseburger, better french fries, and an order of AMAZING chicken wings, same price.   Go support your local businesses.  Great service, really cool people, freakin amazing food in Lakewood.  Dont drive past this common appearing Lakewood bar.  It is easy to miss from the road but you need to go eat their food, now."}
{"text":"I have been to this bar twice, once just for drinks and another time for dinner.   It doesn't seem to get too packed in the evenings but that was nice. Good beer selection and a decent place to watch a game. The bartender was friendly and the feel of this place is pleasant. Nice decor, etc.   Came back for dinner and was very pleased. You can build your own burger and there are LOTS of great toppings. Vegetarian friendly! Fries were also yummy. Decently fast service. The burger wasn't amazing but it was definitely good and I want to go back and try another crazy concoction!"}
{"text":"Stopped in a random Thursday and the wife and I had a great time.  $3 Guinness and Jameson, yes please and there was some nice Irish Music..  The place looks great inside and the burger was really good, nothing like some fresh patties from TJ's.  Overall the bartender was really nice and made us feel welcome, well done we'll be back soon."}
{"text":"I wish that there were negative stars... This place is AWFUL!! I've been eating here for years and have watched the sad decline. I will not be back. ever. The bartender (seems like the only one that they have) is completely rude and devoid of a personality. The drinks she makes are horrible, absolutely undrinkable. We brought this to her attention and got no apology or an offer to remake. The only consistent thing about the food is that it continues to get worse with every trip. VERY disappointing because for years I loved this place"}
{"text":"I had heard a lot of bad things about this place from several friends who had stopped in to check out the new place that opened in the former Lakewood Panini's/Riviera location.  I wished I had listened to them as my experience there was also less then stellar.  While I can see the light at the end of the tunnel this bar as a long way to go before it can get there.  The menu looked pretty good, but it seems as though the cooks (not worth calling them chefs) seem to be in over their heads.  Sadly, when most of your menu is gussied up bar food like deep fried pickles, hamburgers, and various other pub grub it's not a good sign at all.  I ordered a hamburger thinking that with the locally sourced options available as toppings I would get a really good meal.  What I got was a small little hockey puck of a hamburger on an oversized bun.  My first two bites were nothing but bun.  I immediately thought back to that commercial from the 80's where the little old lady asks, \"Where's the beef?\"  Once I got to the beef patty it was dense, dry, and overcooked.  Since I had ordered it to be cooked to medium this was very disappointing.  I had mentioned this to the bartender, and I got a look of indifference with the only solution offered being a free drink.  Really?  The other problem, as it has always been with this location, is parking.  While there is a parking lot nearby it is for the Autozone, and from what I've heard they have Baker's Towing on speed dial so you're left with street parking with is virtually like winning the lottery if you can find a spot within decent walking distance.  I do wish the new owners all the best of luck, and hope that they can get things ironed out as Lakewood needs all the tax generating business revenue that it can get, but if the quality standards continue to be this poor I fear that it will turn into nothing more then the karaoke bar that the Lakewood Riviera had turned into before it's ultimate demise."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick snack and a drink.  I would probably onky give them 3.5 stars but thats not an option so I'll just round up. Definitely got  more of a neighborhood bar type vibe-not unwelcoming but everyone kind of checking us out to see what kind of hooligans we were.  Ordered a Jameson sour-pretty standard drink for me, problem was that it was mainly sour mix-and I mean SOUR. The amount of Jameson in it was nice though. Food was nothing spectacular.  Tots were crisp,  fried pickles were standard. Maybe if we were neighbors, we would frequent them once in awhile,  but at this point I don't think we will go back mainly due to the vibe that was heavy in the air and the super sour mix."}
{"text":"Plank Road is the type of unassuming place that will invite you in even when there is a private party.  Sadly as great a neighborhood pub this place could be their food is not up to snuff. The menu looks great and sounds great, but the execution leaves something to be desired. Their  food is merely ok. And for a bar that's fine. Just don't eat.  One thing Plank Road did get right was beer. They always have lots of great stuff on tap, including the ever elusive Scotty Karate (one of my personal faves). The servers are great. They leave you in peace to imbibe beery goodness but never allow for an empty glass to go unattended.   So while I don't recommend eating here, go in have a drink or two. It's everything a bar should be."}
{"text":"Bartenders were toasted all night. It was like pulling teeth to get a drink. I've had ok service in the past but tonight was a huge flop. I would be back cause I was served accordingly and cheaply but maybe hold back on the booze if ur working?"}
{"text":"I come to this bar often but I wanted to highlight that last two experiences. We came for two of the Cavs finals games. The bar is packed and there was only two bartenders. These are the same two bartenders who seem to be here all the time. They are two of the BEST bartenders I've seen. Very quick and very good at making sure the whole bar is getting drinks and food. They even walk out to every table for drink orders. Job well done!"}
{"text":"I went to get a burger last night and it was not good.  I ordered it medium and it came out char broiled.  The service was not good.  I had to ask for the check 3 times from 2 different bartenders.  I'm pretty disappointed because i live int he neighborhood and it could have been a great new go to.  I guess I'm going to stick with 56West for burger's that is right across the street from Plank Road."}
{"text":"Read the menu online and decided to go in for happy hour - 1/2 off wings and $1 off all drinks.   The place was empty when we got there. We sat at the bar and looked at the menu to decide what we wanted. The in-restaurant menu makes note that the 1/2 off wings are only Friday. The online menu does not make any mention of that. So their happy menu most of the time is justs $1 off drinks which is not a big deal.  I ordered my drink while we looked at the menu and then we ordered a salad, wings, and a buffalo chicken flatbread - $5 special. My drink never came. I had to ask someone else after the food arrived for my drink.  The food was okay and the flatbread tasted too bready. We weren't really content with our food and ended up coming home early. Also, the bill didn't reflect the $1 off my drink."}
{"text":"One of the first places we went in Lakewood after moving up from Georgia. Staff was friendly, drinks were reasonably priced, and the food was good. Definitely gave a good impression of Lakewood and enjoy hanging out here."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday is everybody's typical- so head over here on Plank Roads Taco Wednesday!!! $3 margaritas served tall and with a salt rim on request! Yum...."}
{"text":"Inarguably the best bar in Lakewood, best staff, selection, prices, crowd, everything. Whether it's a Tuesday with few patrons or Saturday when it's SRO, you get greeted and served in 2 seconds. I never had an empty glass during the NBA Finals when there probably 100 customers. There is no other place like it."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect when deciding to come here.  We went for lunch on a Saturday.  There were only two other people in the place.  Our server was fine, not really that friendly but he got the job done.  He didn't write anything down though and had to come back to the table to doublecheck that he remembered them correctly.   We ordered the pork nachos.  There was literally two pieces of pork in them.  I know this because my friend went to the bathroom and I had two nachos, each with one piece of  pork on them.  When she got back, she was kinda peeved cause I had eaten all the pork.  I felt kinda bad.  They were pretty weak.   I got a greek chicken sandwich.  It was ok.  The ciabatta bread was kind of overpowering and would have tasted better toasted.  The chicken was pretty good though.  My friend said her chicken sandwich was just ok as well.  The place was ok.  All I could think of though was the old paninis."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful first experience at Plank Road Tavern. I hesitate to write this review bc both times that I went recently were not that crowded so I feel like I found a Lakewood gem.  To start, three words for you people: Three. Dollar. Margaritas ! And they're good. On Wednesday nights they serve up a good taco for $2/each and cold margs on the rocks are $3. They also have a lovely patio in the back. The service was top-notch too. Great place all around :)"}
{"text":"Food was awesome but service was mehhhhh....the food was worth it all. The fried brie plate was amazing. Planning to go back tonight :)"}
{"text":"If you went in earlier when it just opened, I would consider going back. I live up street and didn't have a good experience my first time there. I noticed that this place was starting to get some good reviews so I just went back last week and was surprised. Good beer list. Good atmospere. Nice and clean. And then there is the food.   I think they went out and got a good chef and expanded their menu. Very fresh ingredients. I got a chicken sandwich and you get to choose your own toppings and it's not pickels and tomatos. I had a really good gruyere cheese and tangy slaw. really good...for $5. They seem to have good specials too.   I orginally thought this place would be gone by labor day, now I can easily see it becoming a lakewood staple."}
{"text":"Came in during the wing crawl.  Pretty cool looking place....a little sparce.  I had the Moroccan dry rub and buffalo.  Moroccan were super good and orriginal..just needed some sort of salt.  The cook was super nice too!  The bartenders were good and pretty quick...I had to ask about the daily specials.  I wish more bartenders would mention that.....I sure would like to save a few bucks on a 12hr drinking binge..lol.  More money for midget porn..  They did have a pretty good selection of micros...it seems a lot of Flakewood bars are getting away from the frat boy Bud Lt and stuff!  All-in-all I would come back for a beer if Im strutting my stuff down Detroit Ave again!"}
{"text":"I am not sure what Plank Road Tavern was before the update because I just moved to the neighborhood, but it's now certainly one of the nicer bars in the area. It's far from your typical Lakewood dive now, while still being casual and affordable. Nice clean interior, fresh paint and a fantastic neon sign are great additions to the neighborhood.  On Mondays they have a burger and beer special for $5. They have a great selection of craft microbrews on draft so you're getting a killer deal. They also have a ton of premo burger toppings for a minimal up charge (I think 25 cents each?). Def get a fried egg on top!"}
{"text":"So I'm giving this place a low rating for a few reasons. It was huge and had a great outdoor patio space but their was no music outside and in order to get the tunes playing inside you had to pay for them. When no one picked a song it was silent in there which was super lame.   On top of that our bartender was the worst. He would not take our order of shots because we were unsure of how many we wanted so he made my friend write down what he wanted and how many on a napkin. How f'ing rude. I tried to order a grape bomb shot but he ignored me and wouldn't take my order. He literally wouldn't make eye contact with me. He was only making one kind of shot. Terrible service. It won't last and I won't be back. I'm not usually such a hater but this place sucked."}
{"text":"Went here last winter, and I am just getting around to writing this review.  The food pissed me off so badly, I am still angry about it.  We went in there after my brother recommended it for the burgers.  We sat at the bar, and the bartender ignored us for fifteen minutes.  We were 2 of a total of 4 people sitting at the bar, so this is unacceptable!  They had my favorite beer on tap (Southern Tier Pumking), so we ordered 2 and asked for a menu.  We each ordered a different burger, and both asked for them medium rare.  We also got an order of the mild wings.  The burgers came out with extremely thin \"Plank Fries\".  They were ridiculously salty and pretty much inedible.   The mild wings, were almost tasteless, with only a hint of spice, and very feeble in size.  The burgers were an abomination to the word.  They were overcooked, and fell apart when we bit into them.  There was obviously no binding agent put into the burgers.  They weren't seasoned and the bun was soggy, which was strange since the burgers were not juicy.  We will not ever be returning to this establishment, which is unfortunate considering how nice the inside looks."}
{"text":"They really revamped and updated the food and beers. I'm now a fan."}
{"text":"I came here about two weeks ago for drinks with some friends.  I recently moved to Lakewood so we are trying to find some new places to check and this place was definitely cool!  We sat at the bar and got gin and tonics which were good and priced well.  There are plenty of seats at the bar to chat, eat or watch a game.  It was a Saturday night so the crowd was young and loud and over all a really nice place to grab drinks.  I would like to come back and try their food!"}
{"text":"Plank Road Tavern is within spitting distance of my home, and I have been watching with a curious eye as the former Lakewood Riviera was gutted and remodeled over the last few months.   In that time, I had been scouring the internet trying to find some bit of information as to what the new space might hold and came up with nothing.  In late December, the lights went on and the doors opened and I thought FINALLY I'll get to see what this place is about.  Still Nothing.   Then a random search brought up a remark on twitter.  The Plank Road Tavern allows you to build your own burgers from delicious locally sourced ingredients- for only $5!  SOLD!  I was finally able to arrange a visit this evening, and am happy with the results.   The grimy bar that was has been transformed into an open yet cozy space, warmly lit and accented with a wall mounted (artificial?) fireplace. A long bar is complimented with a small seating area in front of the fire, with a few other tables towards the windows facing Detroit.  All in all, not a bad set up.   The menu is bar fare with flare, complimented by a formidable beer list.  There were a few entree offerings but the focus is mainly burgers and chicken sandwiches.  There's an assortment of buns, cheeses, and other toppings and for $5 you can pick one of the first two and three of the latter.  For $2 more you can add Plank Fries which are half-steak fry half-chip and all delicious.  I decided to go with a burger on honey wheat with peanut butter, cream cheese and bacon, and after finishing it, I made the decision to make sure I return in the near future for another.  The server explained that the menu is going to be expanded in the future, and that the monthly food and beer specials will focus on specific geographic regions that the beer comes from.   Plank Road made a great first impression on me, I'm looking forward the second. And the third."}
{"text":"One of my best friends that I have known since middle school is now Al Bundy: Married With Children. He wanted to meet up for a couple of beers over Thanksgiving weekend. We came up here to the Plank Road Tavern. This building housed the former Riveria Paninis. There was always a good fight there. Many Lakewood kids earned their stripes fighting adults outside of Paninis. That was back in the mid 90's when I first started drinking. I thought Paninis sandwiches tasted good back then. Plank Road Tavern has a solid beer list. They carried one of my favorite breweries: 3 Floyds Brewing Company. They have the Gumballhead on draft and it is a decent beer. The name of this bar is also nostalgic. Plank Road Brewery made Red Dog and Icehouse beers. I thought they were good when I was in high school because they looked different. I had a Red Dog poster in my room. Reminds me of the Minnie Ripperton classic Back Down Memory Lane:   I stumbled on this photograph  It kinda made me laugh  It took me way back  Back down memory lane   I see the happiness... I see the pain  Where am I... back down memory lane"}
{"text":"My favorite bar in Lakewood. Decent draft beer selection (20+), usually nothing super rare, but they always have solid choices. Once in a while they'll get 3floyds.  The employees are great to talk to, very attentive, and polite. The owner always acknowledges people he recognizes and checks on people around the bar.   They play great music during the week, but Friday and Saturday nights, the jukebox is usually playing, so it's up to whoever pays.   The food is solid, I usually get a chicken sandwich. The tacos on Wednesdays are good, especially the vegetarian ones.  Good atmosphere with a good amount of tv's, a large patio, and a long bar. Not your average lakewood bar. It's great because I can really bring any of my friends here and we'll have a good time. Some bars cater to a certain crowd, this one does not. Awesome place."}
