{"text":"2/2/2017 - Takeout for 2 dishes took about an hour to be ready.  Both Pad Se Eww dishes appeared hastily made and did not taste good.  Restaurant was chaotic with many unhappy customers.  Will NEVER go back to this restaurant.  Go to Brown Sugar in Rocky River instead."}
{"text":"I love this place. Food is delicious. Bubble tea is yumm! Good service!!! I came back so many times."}
{"text":"We drove a bit to try this place out due to some rave Yelps!  So the fact that I had high expectations, and yet was still happily surprised makes this place a Favorite and a Must Return.  

I made a checklist of recommendations on my phone and ordered our way through several that sounded tasty.  We knew we liked curry and Asian food, and so we knew we were likely to enjoy this cuisine.

We got Thai Bubble Tea and the Strawberry Bubble Smoothie.  I had no idea what to expect with these but *SPOILER ALERT* we discovered the \"bubbles\" are tapioca in the drinks.  Weird, and I think I like it!  (Just beware of sucking up the last bits of tapioca through your straw with no drink... the last bubble shot down my throat like a Luge Track Olympian...)  Both were very tasty.

Appetizers we split were the Wonton Cream Cheesy Thingamabobs (sorry, too lazy to look it up)... YUM.  Also the Summer Rolls with Peanut Sauce.  Light (like a good appetizer!) and YUM.  We kept both the sauces which I may or may not have just had spoonfuls of while waiting for our entrees.  We also had the Coconut Chicken Soup which I LOVED.  I could do with some right now!

*Side Note*  As a Fan of coconut and an Intolerant of Lactose, I enjoyed that most (if not all???) of the creamy dishes are creamified with Coconut Milk.  Oh, happy, gut!

I got the Red Curry (which made a second super tasty leftover meal later) and thoroughly enjoyed it.  My hubby got the Siam Seafood and enjoyed it as well.

The only difficulty will be deciding whether to try anything new next time, or ordering it all the same again!"}
{"text":"Not enough \"spice\".

I ordered pad thai, I never order pad thai spicy but I expect it to have flavor. This was bland :("}
{"text":"Whenever I have Thai at a place I haven't visited before, I have to try the Panang Curry. 

Thai Spice does not have the best Panang that I have eaten, but it is very good. The curry itself is a bit creamier and more peanut flavored than I have had in the past, which I really liked.

While this is based on only one visit, Thai Spice has delicious food for very reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food! I especially enjoyed the papaya salad, Thai tea, and tapioca pudding dessert."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant in Las Vegas. We've been coming here for years and I always get the Tom Yum Goong soup. I also really like the Pad Thai here. It tastes like real authentic Thai food. The servers are also really nice and friendly."}
{"text":"It was o.k.  Just o.k.  I guess I'm spoiled by really great Thai food in big portions at Mekong River restaurant on Lee road near Coventry.  That is my to go place for Thai/Cambodian food.  

The price at Thai spice was high, portions were very little, and I basically filled up on white rice.  The dish I ordered was mango curry.  The curry was very watery.

The servers were really really nice though, and it's in Westlake, so those are 2 pluses.  Also, the atmosphere was really nice as well.  I'm sure they will bring in lots of customers because of those things, but not me.  It was an A-O.K. experience."}
{"text":"Really great place.  Haven't been let down once by Thai spice.  Pad Thai is top notch"}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times in the past. The prices are reasonable and servings are of generous size. Food is good. My favorites are the curries, but my girlfriend loves the garlic pepper chicken and veggies with extra garlic. One downside is they need to spend more effort in keeping the restrooms clean- often not a good first impression.

{"text":"I've eaten at Thai Spice twice in the last week.  Once with my wife and once solo.  I've got to tell you that I don't take the time to write many reviews but this place is deserving of my time to give kudos.  On both occasions the service was over the top and the food was exceptional!  Lulu and I don't recall the other waitress are very helpful with explanations and suggestions.  

My next visit will be to share this fabulous find with some friends!

Enjoy!

{"text":"They have a wonderful gluten free menu.  My food was delicious.  It is wonderful to have a quick Asian place by my house that I can call and get gf food I trust within 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Amazing tasting food, love the vegetable curry and the shrimp pad Thai! Very comfortable place inside, service was a little slow at times but we had a very large party."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible!! Dry as it can get and I found a huge piece of shrimp in my soup and I HATE seafood,they never mentioned it at all or gave me a choice.I drove all the way to Westlake from Sheffield because Thai Chili in Avon Lake is closed until late January.This place is a complete joke,Try Thai Chili and you'll see what authentic GREAT Thai food is.Never again ugh"}
{"text":"I've eaten here at least 15 times and gotten takeout many more.  Totally addicted to the pot stickers, chicken curry and pad thai.  The owners and employees are friendly and eager to please.  The ambiance is nothing special, but it can't be beat for Thai takeout."}
{"text":"Always get a good meal there.  Friendly service.  I love the eggplant.  Mailer coupons make prices even better."}
{"text":"Friendly staff & quiet environment.  Delicious food and a wide variety of vegetarian options. Very reasonable lunch prices."}
{"text":"Restaurant is nice and clean. We were a large group of 7 and told the waitress we were going to do the meal \"family-style\". Disappointing that she did not guide us or maybe it's because the chef is not creative... out of the 7 entrees, 5 of them had exactly the same sauce!"}
{"text":"Today I went here with 15 friends. Everyone loved it, we called ahead, the meals were ready when we arrived, the food was excellent, everyone loved it!  The people are very friendly - AWESOME!"}
{"text":"I order take out from here at least twice a month! I typically order the vegetable curry with tofu  and make it thai hot and it is always perfect! I've also had the chicken pho and the green curry and they are also phenomenal."}
{"text":"I've never written a review for a restaurant, but Thai Spice is too good and I go here too much to ignore it any longer. 

My favorite dish is the Red Curry with Salmon. I've also had it with tofu or just vegetables. Simply amazing flavor to this curry. No curry I've had anywhere else compares. And the salmon is always perfect; nicely grilled and never a fishy flavor. I've also had the Green Curry and it's also fabulous (more spicy). The best part is that they're always consistently delicious, with plenty of the wonderful creamy curry sauce in the bowl. My only small gripe is that sometimes they can be slightly skimpy on the vegetables when you just order the veggie curry. But if you tell them upfront, they'll give you more. You can also request which veggies you'd like. 

I also usually order the summer rolls (the ones in rice paper), either the regular with shrimp or the veggie with tofu. The peanut sauce they serve with it is out of this world. So peanutty with a bit of a kick...not overly sweet at all. Just amazing, I could eat a bowl of it straight.

I admit that I stick with my favorites and haven't tried much else on the menu. The Pad Thai (with tofu) is fine, but I'm not a big Pad Thai person. To me that dish is never anything special. I usually like a nice sauce in my main dish.

The service here is excellent; they are very attentive and the owner is very warm and friendly. Also, the atmosphere is nice; simple but good. From the outside it doesn't look like much, but it's pretty spacious with simple decor, soft music, and is just a calming place to be. Ask for the hot tea (it's free) and just unwind with some delicious food!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Vegas. I had been told archies was the old standard but Thai spice takes that title. Their lunch specials are awesome.  Highly recommend the pepper steak with a level 7 spice. Yes u can request your spice level!"}
{"text":"Good Thai for Las Vegas.  Clean, nice atmosphere, very good staff. Food quality was great! Mango sticky rice for desert will keep us coming back! I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Howzit!?

Decent Thai food. Average atmosphere. Good service.

Notable dish: Beef Panang Curry, Garlic Pork with Tofu."}
{"text":"Ive been coming to Thai Spice for 20 years, but tonight was the first time Ive eaten here in awhile...and yeah, it was as good as I remembered.   I think they have the best pad thai in town.  A nice size portion and the flavor is spot on...so good.  Service was prompt and courteous. ..overall...pleasant experience.  Ill be back sooner than later!"}
{"text":"My friends and I came here one night. I have no idea what the food is like because we never sat down. The lady at the front never greeted us, and we were standing there for 15-20 minutes. It was pretty awkward because we didn't know what to do, as we were just waiting for her to talk to us. Maybe she was too busy with other people, but you would think they'd have more staff on busier nights."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch special, quick service. I had the chicken curry lunch special, came with a delicious beef soup and a tasty egg roll."}
{"text":"The Pad Thai was delicious!  Worth the walk from the Strip. Rode the bus back cause I was too full to walk!  Only complaint was that the Thai Iced Tea was served in a small wine glass, but it was soooo good!  Everything reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"Only have one hang up about hi spice which is the fact that thy don't deliver. Other than that it's wonderful. They have a section for vegetarian items, a great variety of appetizers and entrees. The service has always been great and it's a clean and quiet atmosphere."}
{"text":"Decent place. I can't say it was bad, can't say it was very good. I wanted something more authentic and original. There isn't too much in Westlake that meets that criteria. I got the Hot and Spicy Thai Basil. It wasn't that hot, the sauce was serviceable. Didn't try the bubble tea, kinda wish I did.

 If 2.5 was a rating I'd give it that. I give it 3 stars because of the speediness and friendliness of the service. The place is awkwardly quiet though."}
{"text":"We ate four dishes family style and each was was tasty and well prepared.   We got out with 40 bucks for 2 people, and that includes two appetizers.   It took a bit to get our food, but they were busy.   We want to go back in two weeks.   The Mango chicken was wonderful.   The mango chunks were ripe and sweet like candy!   Try the bubble slushee too.   It's yummy!"}
{"text":"During my stay in Vegas, a local Vegas friend of mine took me to this place for lunch.  I ordered the stuffed chicken wings, Thai ice tea and a green curry with chicken (includes a bowl of rice).  The chicken wings is delicious and up to standard of other Thai places I have been to.  The green curry chicken was also very good.  The dish has lots of flavour without being too heavy and oily like other places I have been to.  I ordered extra spicy and only found it mildly spicy so you may want to clarify what level of spiciness you want if you want something spicier.

Prices are very reasonable and overall I am quite happy with my visit here and would definitely come again."}
{"text":"Food is always excellence there and service is also great. They have the best Phad Thai in town. This is the first time we try their curries, beef panang curry and vegetable red curry.  And of course they never disappointed us.  It was very authentic thai style and full of spices.  So far it is my favorite Thai place to go. I will definitely go back there again."}
{"text":"Warning! They are advertising a 10% discount with the check in option. The hostess dismissed it by saying I had to have a printed coupon! Yelp...please correct this with the restaurant management."}
{"text":"I have been here twice in two days.  What is it saying about me and this place? Anyway, there is a new dish that is not on the menu yet.  It's called Bun Bo Hue (#1).  It literally means beef noodle from Hue - a central place in Vietnam. Very tasty and I think it's better than Pho here because it's an authentic dish.  I always enjoy their Vietnamese dishes such as Grill Shrimp(#3)/Pork (#2) with vermicelli noodle - you could add spring rolls with this dish also.  Grill pork with steam rice (#4) is good also.  Their Siams ribs on the appetizers menu is surprisingly good.  And of course the bubble tea is not advertised well enough by the staff.  I recommend first timers try #4 for a basic Vietnamese dish.  I have all my friends try it and they all love it ever since.  The #'s are my ranking of the dishes from Thai Spice."}
{"text":"Worst service I have EVER experienced. I have been here multiple times, each time thinking it can't be worse than the last but they always out do themselves! Don't come here unless you have HOURS to waste. Ordering to go is even worse. When you call ahead they ask what time you want to pick it up, but not like they take that in to consideration anyway. Every time i have ordered take out and come to pick it up, they have never even started my order."}
{"text":"Way too expensive for the service.  And the good is a bit to be desired.  They should call this place Chinese Spice as there is a very small portion of Thai cuisine on the menu."}
{"text":"Great restaurant that was across the street from my room at the Palms Casino. We had their Pad Thai and Tom Yum Goong which were both delicious. The Tom Yum Goong also comes in a flaming pot which keeps it nice and hot. The staff are friendly and the service was also timely. Come here for some great authentic Thai food!"}
{"text":"This place is just amazing. I love coming here for the black jack noodles and the staff is the sweetest and so attentive."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, friendly staff, good food.  Level 8 spice was not too spicy."}
{"text":"Food was so good and prices are reasonable. Definitely coming back next time we are in Vegas"}
{"text":"I used to work just down the block from this place and ate here at least once a week.  Now that we live in San Diego, we find ourselves planning trips back to Vegas just so we can eat at Thai Spice!

Thai Spice has the absolute best Orange Chicken that we have ever had, hands down!  And again, now living in a different state, we have tried many orange chicken dishes trying to find something comparable but no such luck.  They also have wonderful pot stickers.  I have to admit we haven't tried many of their other entrees because the Orange Chicken has us hooked, but what our friends have tried when they have dined with us have always gotten rave reviews."}
{"text":"I don't know what they put in the food but it it's always superb. Been here a handful of times, and every time is outstanding. Tonight we had our usual:

Vegetable spring roll appetizer
Me: vegetable Pad Thai with tofu
Bf: duck with green curry
Thai iced tea with milk
Thai coffee with milk 

Spring rolls always cooked to perfection. 
Both entrees delicious with the perfect amount of spice we requested.

Ambiance is casual, but with a hints of elegance. Quiet and intimate. Excellent service.

Would come more often but it's on the opposite side of town and we don't like coming down to the strip unless absolutely necessary. 
Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Authentic Thai food..
Big portions and high quality good.  Friendly and great service.  Very flexible. Will accomidate special diets and changes to dishes.  Excellent taste !!"}
{"text":"I'm very impressed with this place. It may not look like much from the street, but it has top-notch food. It is often busy, and sometimes the staff could use a little more politeness. But if you want Thai or Chinese food and you are in the area, you cannot get better tasting meals. I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"After waiting 25 minutes, we received water. Not so much as a drink order being taken.  Staff was apathetic and passively rude. Cleanliness was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"This is the most amazing place i'be been to. The Orange chicken was perfect and the waitress was so nice."}
{"text":"Food is always good. Been going to this place since the 90's. Would give it a higher rating, but the service was TERRIBLE. It was 5:30, no one else in the place. Waitress dropped the food, never came back to check on us, refill our drinks, nothing. My companion had to go to the counter to ask for more water while both servers sat behind the counter. When the waitress dropped the check, she never asked if we wanted anything else. Sad, good food...terrible service."}
{"text":"The food here is really really good IMO. The atmosphere could definitely use a spruce up, but the food is on point and good price. We are regulars here."}
{"text":"$7.25 curry chicken off the lunch menu included soup, a little bit of salad, an egg roll, rice, and curry chicken and it was yummy!  Curry chicken even had potatoes in the sauce and when you order you tell them how spicy you want your food from 1 to 10.. i had 5 and it was just right.   Super friendly service."}
{"text":"I went here with my photographer, Richard Faverty, who is a regular.  There were 7 of us and we ate family style so we could all taste the dishes.  My favorite was the duck.  The food was all very good and the service was excellent.  

The atmosphere was maybe a little too sedate for my tastes, but we didn't get the evil eye or anything for being the loudest group in the place (with 6 entertainers it can't be helped).  The prices are very reasonable.  We ordered 4 appetizers and then all had an entree and it was still about $25 a person.  

I'll definitely go here again when I want a good relaxed dinner with friends after a photo shoot.  Not the wildest place in Vegas but you don't always want that, right?"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal authentic Thai food. Friendly service and great food. The classic Black Jack noodles and Pad Thai dishes really stand out. Paired with fresh young coconut really sealed the deal."}
{"text":"I really am not the type to write a bad review for a place, but this is just gross. I order from here at least 5 times a month, being my fav thai place around the corner from my job. Well, I go in today to order the usual pad thai and thai iced tea. Three quarters of my cup was full with thai tea and I asked them to fill it to the top. Then I get to my office to eat, only to pull out a PIECE OF WIRE OUT OF MY MOUTH. I get it, shit happens and people make mistakes but for me to call them and complain about it and for them to just say \"OH WELL, COME IN AND WE'LL MAKE YOU A NEW ONE\" like seriously?! I was so close to swallowing the damn thing and you can't offer a credit or anything? So Thai Spice, here is your bad review and you have lost a loyal customer."}
{"text":"Sone of their dishes are good, others not so much.  My companion was unhappy to find chopped iceberg lettuce in whichever Thai salad she had.  The curries we had were decent.  

The problem with this place is twofold.  First, their ingredients are subpar (the chicken was tasteless).  Second, there are Vietnamese, Chinese and Thai dishes on the menu.  This is a restaurant in search of a real
 identity.  The waitresses were very, very nice.   This place has the potential to be good.  Sadly, I do not think that potential will be realized."}
{"text":"Looking for a new place to eat lunch, only things around my work are fast food, I found this place.  I had to run an errand in the area, and this place was just next door, so based on other reviews decided to give it a chance.

I ordered the Vietnamese chicken salad bowl, grilled chicken with vegetables and Vermicelli rice noodles and a sweet lime dressing. The chicken was thinly cut and grilled and had a sweet/spice flavor to it, it was very tasty on it's own, but once you add the dressing to the whole salad, it just gave this overall great flavor. It was also light and felt like it was healthy, at least I hope it was.

I will definitely come back here again for lunch."}
{"text":"I am surprised by the raves about the yellow curry.  I found it very underwhelming.  It was so very one note. It was sorely missing the coconut notes.  The dish itself consisted of chicken and potatoes.  No carrots, sweet potatoes, onions?  Nothing else?  Very disappointed. I was told this is one of the better Thai places in Vegas, and that may be, but to all, please visit the Pacific Northwest if you want some to die for curry."}
{"text":"Decided to give it another try after a not too impressive experience. Went there for dinner last night.  Food was ok, nothing to rave about.  I had the grilled pork chop rice dish, it was at best luke warm. My problem with that place during both experiences was that the service is SUPER SLOW. We arrive around 715 and out dinner came around 840 (no exaggeration). There were about 7 or 8 table occupied during that time and there were about 3 waitresses working.  They asked us for our beverage order about 15 minutes after we sat down. Then another 15 minutes later asked us what we wanted to eat which the food took almost an hour to arrive. I really wanted to tell them to just forget about it and go somewhere else.  Anyway, we didn't leave until after 9. I have never been to a restaurant with services this slow before.  I will not be going there for a third time."}
{"text":"Good place to have Thai food. the chicken satay and the phat Thai noodle are great the service is wonderful to. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"had late lunch today ( trying to complete my  flamingo rd run of restaurants ...close...very close ) - ordered pineapple friend rice w/ chicken ( ok but canned pineapple ?!?!  bummer ) . shrimp salad ( my guess - purchased pre-cooked shrimp lightly grilled for heating slad dressing ...much much better at kung fu ) and house special scallops ( decent sized , properly cooked w/ veggies a couple scoops of white rice ) diet coke for me, thai tea for SO....ok


service - decent 

total cost - $45

would i return ....naw ...too many other thai places that are a cut above"}
{"text":"I m writing after multiple visits to this place.
First few times were a great overall experience.
Last two times have been average in terms of food.  Did they change chefs?
Seating and ambience are great. I love that there is no TV. Plenty of booths and two-seater's for couples.
Service has been great every time.  
I have tried 75% of their vegetarian menu.  Quality of food is good every time.  
Couple months ago we went in group of 9. We all ordered variety of different dishes.  Most of them tasted similar.
Last time we ordered takeout for 5.  No one liked the taste of their food.
Maybe they do have a new chef."}
{"text":"I unfortunately am one of the rare customers that is giving this place a low rating and review. I wanted to love this place because everyone has written such amazing reviews but I found the food to be just okay. Maybe it's because I live closer to China Town and eat at all those places and I might be picker about my food but I thought the flavor was lacking.

My date ordered Pho Steak & Thai Jade Noodle and I ordered the Mango Fried Rice w/ Chicken. I asked for them to add medium spice top my dish which apparently means add no spice at all. Along with no spice I felt the dish wasn't very flavorful. The Thai Jade Noodle was interesting and was probably the best dish out of the three.

I have a feeling I will give this place another try only because for the most part everyone has given this place great reviews."}
{"text":"I've been craving pho ever since I left New Orleans, where the Vietnamese community can make a mean bowl. I've heard great things about the restaurants on the East Side of Cleveland, but I'm not there. And I don't have a lot of money to drive there. SO!

I heard about Thai Spice and a friend and I tried it out for lunch. There were only two or three other groups there, but the interior is nicely lit, clean and quiet. The service was fairly quick even though only one employee seemed to be servicing the entire area. We ordered summer rolls, which were good but not amazing, and I had my beloved Pho while Anna ordered the a noodle dish with jade in the name. She liked it, and it was spiced to her liking (as she had requested when ordering). The prices are fairly cheap.

I'd give the place four stars, but we were never asked if we wanted to try one of the supposedly delicious bubble teas, or shown a menu with them listed on it. So I'll go back and give it another try. Definitely drop by if you're in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Food was very good, we had the chicken dumplings, spring rolls, red curry chicken and pad Thai.  Nicely spiced.  Service was wonderful.  My friend and I met there to plan our trip to Thailand and our waitress was informative, friendly and gave us some great travel tips.   We're looking forward to going back and learning more to prepare us for our trip"}
{"text":"I just can't get enough of this place, I'm addicted. The service is always on time, the food quality is up there and the taste is consistently delicious. I have never dined in, but I come in at least once or twice a week for take out. With so many delicious options, why not?

 I can personally recommend the shrimp and chicken wonton soup, siab ribs, spring rolls, pad thai (spicy and regular), red and yellow curry and the Vietnamese rice bowl (the pork is just excellent, then again so is the chicken). 

Let's talk pho, which is one of my favorite things to order on a cold day. Their standard beef and chicken is good, I always get mine spicy. But they have a chicken curry pho with potatoes, carrots, sweet potatoes in a coconut milk curry broth. This is now my favorite pho I have had. If you like pho and curry it's a no brain-er.

I don't like anything with Thai basil in it, just too strong of an herb for my taste. You might like it, just wanted to throw that out there as a tip. Now I have half of my office addicted as well. My favorite lunch in Westlake and it's still only $7. But this is also a great dinner option too, $10-$15 is a great price and even better value. Yum."}
{"text":"It's a wonder this place doesn't have 5 star rating! It's beat Thai food we've had including  in Thailand.. Just be aware that 5 is vey spicy here!!"}
{"text":"This place completely screwed up my carryout order. They then tracked me down and MADE IT RIGHT. I cannot speak more highly of an establishment than that.
The food was great, the service was better than average. But the commitment to the customer was as good as it gets. Although it is a fur piece from my digs, I will pass two other Thai establishments to go back. Well done, \"Lynn\"....or \"Leen\". 

BTW: What they call \"extra spicy\"... isn't. If a tablespoon of straight Siracha is 8/10, their \"Danger Will Robinson 'Very Spicy'\" is a 6.
Endit. Pyt."}
{"text":"The food is phenomenal! I wish I could say the same about the service, however we've been here several times and most of the time, we seem to be unlucky and get the same waitress. She is very short and makes sure it is known that she is very busy and may or may not be able to check in on you. Be prepared to order when she heads over to your table, otherwise you'll be stuck waiting 15 to 30 minutes for her to make her way back to you. I would give this place 5 stars for their food, but the service can most definitely use some help."}
{"text":"Man I was so happy that it was such a good experience here! We had just landed and we were starving, so we wanted some asian food that was cheap so we hit this place. It was far from the strip, recommend you have a car if you are a tourist, but I cant even remember what we ordered but we all ordered something different and the food was FULL OF FLAVOR, absolutely delicious and yummy! When I visit Vegas again I am definitely not skipping out on this place, the service was great and prices were reasonable for Vegas. I just wish I knew their recipe for the prig khing, the sauce was seriously mouth watering. Ugh...I hate living so far away and not even being able to fill my cravings!

Just try this place, you'll enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Everything is so good: Pho, salmon curry, spring roll salad. You seriously can't go wrong. Sometimes they're really busy and it might be a wait, but it's well worth it."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place around 8pm on a Sunday evening. Fortunately they closed at 10pm.The place sees to be run \"mom and pop\" style and the staff are friendly. We went with spring roll, Pho, and a vegetable dish. Overall not bad and gets the job done. My relatives liked the spring roll and vegetable dish. I've tried a lot of Pho dishes, so to me this one is average in  my opinion, considering this place is kind of a dual nationality restaurant offering thai and vietnamese dishes."}
{"text":"I was so excited when I saw they had bubble tea so my husband and I stopped in one afternoon around 4ish knowing nothing about the place (and not even checking yelp first). They weren't busy at all as only one table was full...and yet we had to wait 15 minutes for our tea. It was amazingly delicious however and the cashier/waitress was really friendly but I have to take a star off for the crazy long wait."}
{"text":"One and a half stars only.  Some Yelpers rate this restaurant 4 and 5 stars?  Really??  Come on, it is not even close to a three.  4 and 5 stars are reserved for the finest tables in the best restaurants in the world.  Here, the food was poor to unremarkable.  I had lunch here with my girlfriend on 07/02/16.  Nothing was that good, except the service. She agreed!  The food was mediocre at best.  Most Thai places are generally acceptable and good.  Not Thai Spice.  This was an LV rated place, but we didn't find it worth a second trip.  I had their lunch special and didn't finish it."}
{"text":"Always delicious - never disappoints. Chicken curry is delicious (with spice from 1-10) as well as the mongolian beef. They always serve their plates with a bit of rice, which is always a plus for me (grew up in Asian food - always will love rice hehe). Delicious food."}
{"text":"TOTAL GEM!  Wow.  We stumbled across this place after spending the day in the West 'burbs.  I ordered the Panang Curry with chicken and the boyfriend ordered the Pad Thai.  We are HUGE fans of Mint Cafe in Coventry and we honestly didn't think we'd ever find something like like as much but we have to say that Thai Spice is every bit as good as Mint Cafe.  Service was excellent.  We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Worst Thai Food I ever ate. We ordered Tom Yum Goong soup,Chicken Satay, Pad Thai and House Fried Rice. First thing we ordered food to be prepared spicy and hot. None of them are spicy or hot. Everything is cold and mild. Pad Thai is so sweet, my wife couldn't eat it. She left all the plate. I didn't liked Fried rice too. Its so mild and not tasty either. And all their dishes are expensive. Not worth 

Very disappointed. For sure we are not going to visit again. I will not recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing staff; they totally catered to our every need even though it was closing time. Every bite of food was delicious and fresh, especially the Wet and Wild noodles. I can't say enough about everyone that worked there. It's like we were guests in their home. Prices were just right too. Worth driving out of your way for."}
{"text":"ease n simple, food taste good. service was fast n friendly.
portion of food was good. excellent..

pd: please take in consideration, restaurant was not busy at the time of our visit. but overall good"}
{"text":"I found this unassuming place tucked into a small strip mall on the west side of Cleveland thanks to my Yelp! compadres...and was impressed!  Prompt service, friendly waitstaff, and (most importantly) outstanding Massaman curry shrimp!  I'll be back........."}
{"text":"The inside of this place is very calming with smooth music playing . The waiter was nice and wrote down the order (I dislike when they don't write down orders) I got a Thai tea no milk and it was \"ok\" mu suggestion say little ice, my glass was so full of ice! Yuk! My friend had the stuffed chicken and he said it was really good. He described it as \" it's nice and stuffed\" also had the golden fried shrimp and they where amazing . It was crunchy but a soft crunchy , love that. Pad Thai was good as good and had a nice portion . Thanks and will return to your restaurant :)"}
{"text":"Ate here with a friend. Had the chicken curry soup. It was pretty good, and the portions are big."}
{"text":"i'd decided to check out Thai Spice to try the bubble tea but then completely forgot to order one. 
instead, we decided to try new things we'd not had before. i had the Thai String Beans with Chicken. while not as spicy as i'd have liked the flavor was delicious. i did want more cashews. the sauce was so good and i nearly spooned the remaining sauce into my mouth like soup long after the rice and the rest was gone. 
Danielle had the Green Noodle Curry and didn't like it as much as she like mine. I thought hers tasted good, though
we also shared an order of Shrimps in Blankets and they were dyn-o-mite!"}
{"text":"We love Thai Spice!

Delicious Thai cuisine, good portion sizes, friendly staff, and BUBBLE TEA! What more do you need?"}
{"text":"Tofu green noodle Curry is the best curry ive ever had. I'm not much for tofu but the noodles really add to the dish"}
{"text":"I stopped here for lunch the other day. The lunch specials were $7.25 so I ordered the Pepper Steak. The lady asked what level spice I wanted it so I tried level 8. The pepper steak had great flavor but I would go for level 10 next time since it could have been spicier for my taste. The meal started with a soup that I just thought was okay and a salad that I didn't try. The egg roll and rice that came with my pepper steak was real good.

Service was good and the food came out quick. The price was right and portion of food good so I will stop by for lunch again."}
{"text":"This is my new go-to place for Pad Thai! I was a little hesitant to go after varying reviews on the service and food. 

As for the food, I was very delighted. Each dish I saw was of a large quantity (perfect for leftovers) and very visually appealing! The menu that another customer shared was a bit outdated. My Pad Thai was roughly $10. The service was so-so, but the staff did apologize for being understaffed tonight. And the restaurant was adorable. They had lot of plants and decor. There was quiet music in the background and it wasn't too loud - perfect for more intimate dinners or out with a group of friends."}
{"text":"The last time I was at TS was approximately 10 years ago.  Heard the gents in the office talking about who their boss sweats when they do lunch there.  Beads of sweat a rolling off his brain housing group when the level 10 of hotness is ordered.  

It just so happened I was in the area and suggested to the GF and the Boy about paying the place a visit.  It was determined we would pay a visit on a Monday late afternoon for some chow.

The parking lot was not full and so I took this a lucky sign.  Rarely (VERY), do I ever get lucky parking and on this particular occasion I litterally parked in the front of the front door.

Walking in TS was smaller then I remembered.  The half booths along the wall were very comfortable.  The area around the table smelled wonderful with jasmine.

Service was in every way on the slow side.  This is annoying especially when the restaurant is not busy.

I ordereed up some Thai Spice Beef.  Sautéed strips of beef served over some crispy rice noodles.  I went with a #5 in hear, which upon arrival of the order found (and requested) it needed additional spiciness.  I don't know how long it had been sitting in the back because outside the core of food was sort of warm. I kick myself in the ass for not have ordering the Pad Thai.  That is what I remember in my previous dining experiences. 

Would I drive across the valley to dine....probably not.  Would I dine again in if I was in the immediate area.....sure."}
{"text":"This was on January 11, 2013.  We hadn't been here for a long while, but since it was just my dad and me, we decided on Thai.  Since Siam Orchid closed, we weren't sure about where to go but I noticed Thai Spice had a Gluten free menu, and that clinched it.  Thai Spice is in a strip mall with Stein Mart and the outside is very blah, but that just shows not to judge a book by its cover.  Inside, there was more decoration than I remember from my previous visits, with lots of plants and art.  I got the gluten free menu and my dad got the regular.  Now, I did notice some things on the menu that didn't seem like they could possibly be GF in this type of family owned place, but I just stuck with what I knew to be gluten free.  Thus, the Chicken Coconut Soup and the Pad Thai.  Dad also went for the soup as well as the Masaman Curry with tofu and some hot tea.  The soup came out (and I took pictures, how hipster), and despite its simple appearance, it is full of flavors like lemongrass, galangal, lime, a bit of chili, and of course coconut milk.  The chicken is plentiful enough, though I would probably get this stuff for just the broth. Mmmmm.

A bit later, dinner came out (more of a take your time place), and both dishes were good.  The Pad Thai was good, though it is difficult to rate when it is such a common dish.  I noticed no flaws, and if there are only 3 pieces of shrimp, there was plenty of chicken.  Of course the tail shells were left on, which I always dislike, but it wasn't too messy taking them off.  Dad's curry, which I briefly tried, was yummy and comforting.  I probably could have stood the heat in it, but you never know.  I had been thinking of ordering it when I found dad had decided on it.

It was a nice, mostly quiet supper, with yummy food full of spices and a better atmosphere than before.  The staff was pleasant and filled my water frequently, though I suppose I would have appreciated a pitcher or carafe at our table.  And I will be back for more Thai food when it is dad and me again."}
{"text":"Food was okay. Good flavor but combination of Vegetables and protein was way out of line"}
{"text":"The best Tom Yum soup in town! Don't expect anything too fancy from this family owned restaurant but the quality of the food and the service are great! Even basic dishes like the Shrimp Pad Thai are to die for. I come here every other week."}
{"text":"This place was great. The service was definitely awesome. I ordered the chicken chow mein and the noodles were perfectly cooked, tender with not too much oil. I got the spice level 3 (I'm a wimp!) and it was definitely spiced well. This is my new favorite Thai place!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. 

I was reminded of this again, last night, as we walked into another Thai restaurant closer to our home, and 6 people pushed in front of us declaring they had reservations for a table of 27, which I guess entitled them to be seated first. Color them rude! So, my husband and I decided to ditch the place as fast as we could and find a new restaurant. 

We were on our way to the Phil at the Smith Center and had limited time. Flamingo was right on our way to the I-15, and Thai Spice came immediately to mind!  It is in the strip mall adjacent to the Palms Casino. We should have thought of Thai Spice in the first place. The atmosphere is relaxed, the hostess warm and friendly, we got to sit anywhere and chose \"our table\"..which is a joke as we have only been here 4 times, yet we found the cozy table for 2 by the window that I always pick available for our dining pleasure. Our server got us in and out in so we comfortably made the drive up to the Smith Center in time for the show.

Now the food. It is scrumptious and leaves no doubt as to why the Thai Spice has been ranked Vegas top Thai restaurant for many years in a row. Try the egg rolls, they taste homemade. Look at the loving care that they put in carving a carrot into a beautiful flower to accompany the plating. Order the Pad Thai and rediscover the joy of eating.

Our cost dinner for two + appetizer $34."}
{"text":"Delicious Thai food!  We probably should dine in sometime but always happy to oblige our carry outs.

My favorite is the Barbeque Pork plate...just perfection!  B loves the Chicken Coconut Soup with side of plain rice noodles.  Also the Chicken Satay is OUTSTANDING!  Excellent Pho!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We got take away for lunch. 
Vietnamese salad- 3 stars large portion
Toong tong- 5 stars. Delicious crispy excellent flavor
Won ton soup- 3 stars. Very flavorful, but the won tons were a bit bland
Pad Thai- 3  stars. only 3 shrimp in the entire dish. But noodles were flavorful
Chicken satay- 1 star. Dry chewy chicken. Sauce not great.
Thai iced coffee- 4 stars. Very good coffee flavor. Big cup.
We would definitely come again. Very good portions, more than enough to share."}
{"text":"Meeting up with a group of friends can certainly account for an enjoyable evening.  But when I dine on a good meal, it just enhances it!

Even though we were in a larger group, 3 of us decided to share some of their dishes to get a taste of several things.  We started with the Chicken Satay and Potstickers.  I cannot stress how much I love the peanut sauce that accompanies the chicken satay.  Needless to say I really liked them and would order them again.  The potstickers had a cabbage filling which surprised me since I was used to them having a meat filling.  It was all good.  It basically had the flavor of an egg roll.

For our entrees we split the Drunken Noodle with beef as well as the Yellow Curry Combo.  The drunken noodle dish was compiled of a flat noodle, plenty of beef & vegetables.  Again, I'm not the expert but I thought they did a great job!   

When we ordered the Yellow Curry Combo we wanted a spice level of 7.  The waitress didn't think we could handle that spice so she suggested a 4 or 5.  Now our group liked spice.  The dish certainly needed more of a heat level.  They brought out some of the spice so we could add it ourselves.  I thought that was a little odd.  I still enjoyed the flavor of the yellow curry without the spice before we added more.  

Beside the spice snafu, our service was good.  They were very polite and attentive.  Thank you Thai Spice for furthering my education on thai food."}
{"text":"Friendly service and a good bargain. Had the thai yellow curry with chicken. Decent portion but unfortunately it was overly spiced with ginger and mostly tasted like a red curry trying to be a yellow curry"}
{"text":"Visiting from Pittsburgh and decided to try based on location and the Yelp reviews. And absolutely satisfied. A very nice, non-flashy, well decorated seating area, very polite and smiling staff... and great food. I had the Garlic Tofu as I eat vegetarian, and my friend ordered the Basil Chicken, at spice levels 7 and 8 respectfully. Food arrived quickly, and hot...both temperature and at the spicyness levels we'd requested. 
So for some excellent Thai food in an environment that lets your mind focus on the taste, I highly recommend."}
{"text":"This food was awesome. The lemongrass soup, peanut sauce on the spring roll and the green noodle curry will definitely things we will come back for more of."}
{"text":"What a gem! Great little spot to get your Vietnamese or Thai food fix.  Located in a little strip mall you'd never expect to find all the flavors of your standard dishes like Pad Thai and Pho.   They even have bubble tea!! 

Restaurant has a nice peaceful ambiance and is great spot for both romantic dates or family outings.   

Caution, they can get a bit slammed in the kitchen and wait times vary depending on how busy they are but the food is awesome and well worth the wait. 

Definitely recommend it to anyone in the area looking for some quality Thai/Viet cuisine."}
{"text":"Mostly great because it's Thai food on the Westside, although it serves Vietnamese, too.

While enjoyable, this place is nothing special. The ambiance was calming and generically \"Asian.\" The restaurant was empty and quiet (only recently opened?). The food was fresh and standard-Thai-delicious. I regret not ordering the summer rolls as I hear they're great.

I went there for lunch with coworkers, and recommend it for that purpose. It's worth going to if you're in the area and looking for something easy and tasty, but probably not worth planning a day around."}
{"text":"This place has very good thai-food and thai owned. Tom Yum soup, Papaya Salad, Fried catfish curry, and Singha! An authentic feast to savor."}
{"text":"Located in a run down strip mall and has been there many years. This \"grand opening\" sign is BS. There are too many Thai restaurants in this vicinity to have poor customer service. The aging waitress was too busy flirting with the older, caucasian male to worry about the only other customer in the place. He was ranting and raving about how great the soup was that she had served him 5 minutes prior. Being it was cold outside and I absolutely LOVE soup, I asked the aging server and customer, \"Which soup is that?'' The server rudely said, \" We no serve to public!\" Well! After this display, Thai Spice will no longer have to worry about serving anything to me. I will take my business (a couple blocks to the west) to Archies. Archies is AWESOME and has yet to insult!"}
{"text":"Suburban Deliciousness!!!!

The restaurant is nestled away on one end of Stein-Mart Plaza.  It's authentic Vietnamese and Thai food that's really close to me- saves me a trip downtown.  

Don't skip the Thai Coffee- it's perfectly sweetened with condensed milk and offers the most delicious aroma. THE SHRIMP AND CHICKEN WONTON SOUP IS THE BEST- PERFECTLY SEASONED AND COMFORTING on a chilly fall/winter day.  It has become my version of \"grandma's chicken noodle soup.\" :D  
The summer rolls were very fresh and meshed well with their peanut/hoisin sauce- nothing too special though.  
I tried their steak pho soup, which was good (OF COURSE NOT AS GREAT AS SUPERIOR PHO- but for a suburban Thai/Vietnamese restaurant good) They gave us plenty of bean sprouts and lime to squeeze into the soup with siracha and hoisin.  
I was a little disappointed with the Broken Rice there- maybe because I got the chicken version.  The chicken was slightly tangy and sweet, but not as marinated and as well seasoned as it should have been.  The rice, cucumber, pickle, and carrots were very good.  The rice had a nice sticky consistency, as Broken Rice should.  Again, my palate is probably a little discriminatory since Superior Pho's Broken Rice.  

The service was speedy and very accommodating.  The waitresses were very nice and patient as we decided what to get.  

The atmosphere is quiet and relaxing.  The decor reminds you of colonial Vietnam or Thailand with the wrought iron and exotic flower decor.  They have a set of ornate candle lamps hanging from the wall.  Several buddhas and an antique trunk adorning the waiting area with several comforting chairs.

The meals are relatively inexpensive.  We even go take out to go with our dinner and were completely stuffed at the end, spending only 42.00 after dinner and take out (including 3 appetizer soups, 1 appetizer, steak pho soup, broken rice, a thai coffee + tapioca pearls, and another 
pho soup (to-go) .  

Next time, I'll try the pad thai or pineapple rice.  
YOU MUST MUST GET THE SHRIMP AND CHICKEN WONTON SOUP. its DEEELLLLLLIIIIICCCCIIIIIOUUUUUSSSS!!!  and the waitresses will make you feel welcomed and at home :)."}
{"text":"The thing to know about Thai Spice is that if you order average dishes here, you're probably going to have an average experience. Go for the more diverse dishes you don't see on every Thai menu for an experience that will stand out. 

Came in with a large group and everyone seemed pretty satisfied with their food, I found their papaya salad and shrimp pad thai to be on par with others in town. But I was downright impressed with the catfish curry and the whole fried pompano- they're not especially complicated dishes but well-executed, cooked so the fish wasn't dried out and the sauces were robust and at the specified spice level (7/10). I will definitely be back for the catfish, and love that they have several seafood dishes including a soft shell crab salad.

Service was efficient even considering our large group (~20), and made good recommendations. Lunch specials are available, as is online ordering through Yelp with Eat24."}
{"text":"Let's be honest, I don't actually know how legit Thai food is meant to taste. I'm not from the area, but I came across this place by working in the area. The first time I stopped I got the Beef Cashew Pan-Fried Dish. My only complaint was that I asked for it \"spicy\" which apparently meant no spice at all. I've since learned to ask for it \"Thai spicy.\" Since my first experience I've fallen in love with the Thai string bean and pork dish. Does it taste like Thai food, I have no idea, but it's delicious.  Today I went out on a limb and ordered the Beef Green Curry. The spice was phenomenal.  I'll be ordering it again.  I've only stopped during lunch hours, I can be in and out within 35 min.  Overall, I'm very pleased with Thai Spice, and I will continue to be a customer."}
{"text":"We found this restaurant traveling from Chicago to MA. great dinner and lovely waitress!! Very reasonable price-wise."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years always solid excellent soups Tom Yum is really good can't go wrong"}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant, I usually get beef larb and Im picky on what I eat I use to have this home made when I was younger, and so I went to so many freaking restaurants looking for the good flavor , till I found it whenever they see me there they already know what Im getting , and the thai tea its just as good , for as long the flavor stays the same I will continue going there. and the coconut soup its fantastic."}
{"text":"Lady behind the counter with short hair (perhaps owner) was hurried and showed no compassion or gratitude. Ignores you when you mention \"No MSG\".

Then when she gave change she almost threw it into my hand. RUDE

On top of that and spending 20 plus for dinner, they now offer the rice in a container that is so small that it's about 2 spoonfuls...

Won't be returning or reccomending."}
{"text":"Thai Spice is an old well known Thai resturant to the area. I've never actually tried their dinner menu just their lunch specials so I guess this review is for that. 

Although their other menu items looks really good it is a ways out for me to come here just for their Thai food. It is located near the strip on Flamingo and Arville across the street from The Palms Place and next to caboose or something. The Resturant has a mix match hodge podge decor and the staff is friendly enough. 

We normally come here for their lunch special because it's the closest Thai place close to our work. The Lunch menus is not huge but it comes with a tiny salad, a veggie eggroll, a little bit of rice, soup of the day (which is never exciting) and a entree of your choice. The food is ok and the other side that comes with it is bare minimum but I guess what is there to complain about when the meal is about $7 bucks right? Thai tea is good not consistent in taste and sweetness and the wait sometime during lunch is forever.

All in all you get what you pay for unless you get an actually order of their regular egg rolls which is now my Ultimate favorite. An order of 6 egg rolls filled with the typical filling fried battered and then deep fried again and their is only one other place that does them like this and it is in Clovis Ca at Sun Rise Kitchen. Needless to say I was VERY stoked to see these egg rolls like this especially when I wasn't expecting much from them. So that I am in love with. But other then that I will keep them as my go to for cheap descent lunch Thai when I am at work."}
{"text":"I've been on a curry kick lately. Yellow with chicken to be exact. I ordered the dinner portion from here, which comes with pineapples and potatoes. I love when they put pineapples in curry, they add a subtle sweetness that really brings the dish together. I originally asked for the lunch special, but because I wanted pineapples with my curry, they made me purchase the dinner portion. I was a bit put off by this, for one I had no need for that much food at lunch, and for two, why? I didn't think that the curry received from the lunch special menu would be any different than the dinner menu, but alas it must be true. 

Honestly I didn't want the soup and small salad that came with the lunch special anyway, plus now I have dinner covered so it all worked out. On a spiciness scale of 1-5 I got a 2 and it could have been much hotter. Still tasty nonetheless. One thing to note is they give a small portion of rice and a whole lotta curry, but I found this is standard with many thai places.  See my pix for reference."}
{"text":"Very impressed with this spot! The food is always fresh and cooked to order. Beef salad, soups, pad Thai, curry and larb gai (sp? Pretty much lettuce wraps with ground chicken and fresh veggies). Oh and bubble tea, all have been amazing! Service with a smile and prices are reasonable! 4.7 stars!"}
{"text":"I ordered takeout from Thai Spice on the way home from work last night. It had been one of those days where I started looking at the clock on my computer at 10am, wishing it was 6 already. I called in my order when I was about 20 minutes away and was quoted the same amount of time for pickup. And true to their word, they were bringing my order up from the kitchen as I was walking in the door. Points to Thai Spice for punctuality! There is nothing that irritates me more when I am tired and just want to go home than waiting an extra 10 minutes than quoted for takeout. I ordered the Pad Thai and my boyfriend ordered the garlic beef. As I mentioned before, my boyfriend is an Asian food snob. I always get nervous trying new Asian restaurants with him because if one little thing is wrong (my god, they put mushrooms in Mongolian beef?! How DARE they! That's not authentic!) I hear about it for the rest of the meal. And I was in no mood for that last night. But luckily he was happy with his garlic beef. The quality of beef was good, and the sauce had a great flavor. My Pad Thai was...ok. I was in such a rush ordering, I didn't specify how spicy I wanted it. But then again, the girl taking my order didn't ask either. So I guess she just assumed I wanted it mild. And mild it was. All the ingredients were fresh and good, but it was missing some kick. I would order it again, but next time I'll make sure to ask for it hot. The Siam rolls we got were tasty little treats and the summer rolls were pretty good too. The only issue I had is that she packed the summer rolls in with our hot food, so they were a little warm by the time we got home. I prefer my summer rolls chilled. All in all, not bad for a suburban Thai place."}
{"text":"Food here is above average. 

I ordered the Chicken & Shrimp Pad Thai - level 5/10 in Spice. It was pretty good. It wasn't too dry, chicken was soft & came with 2 jumbo shrimps perfectly cooked. 

I also ordered their Papaya Salad - level 7/10 spice (without green beans) it was goood. Thinner slices of papaya, whole uncrushed peanuts & shredded carrots. 
Water wasn't as dark as I preferred but, it was still good. 
I would suggest it to start off. 

Sound level was at about a 3 to 4. 
My experience was quiet with light 90's hip hop playing lightly in the front & lastly, service was Ok."}
{"text":"Mmmmm, mmmmm!! 
It was really good, service was a bit slow but I think that there was only one server on but she was hustling. Food was hot and delish. Price was right and maybe we went a little crazy on how much we ordered. I almost needed a wheel barrel to roll me out of the place! Thai tea prolly has me all jacked up right now and hence the verbiage..
YOU DONT HAVE TO BE CHINESE TO HAVE FORTUNE COOKIES! They were invented in San Fran for crying out out! 

Thanks for the great meal!!"}
{"text":"It's with a sad heart that I'm having to downgrade my previous review of Thai Spice.

The last three times I've eaten their food I've noticed that the quality has slipped.  For instance the shrimp in my pad thai having that \"fishy\" smell and not being de-veined, the summer rolls having overcooked vermicelli, and tom yum goong being very bland.  Maybe it's just me, but these are simple things that a Thai restaurant should have under control.

It's a bummer, too, because I work very nearby and loved having them as a lunchtime dining option."}
{"text":"Some of the best Thai in Cleveland, with tons of veg options.

Something happened here that's never happened at any other Thai restaurant I've been to:  when I placed my order (the vegetable pad thai and the string beans and tofu) the waitress asked me -- before I could say anything else -- if fish sauce was OK!  I said, \"Actually, I was about to ask you if we could have it without.\" And she said, \"Yes, no problem.\"  That was a sign that they get it when I say \"vegetarian.' (Did they lie to me? I don't think so.)

That said, the food was excellent.  Flavorful ad perfectly seasoned.  The servings were big but not huge; we still had some leftovers to take home.  Overall a really great place for truly veg Thai food.

The tempura vegetable appetizer was great too, with lots of chunky vegetables in just the right amount of batter.

My only problem was with the service. While the servers were extremely friendly they were also pretty inattentive. I saw lots of waving to get their attention (me included)."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Thai Spice recently, but the times that I've eaten there I have truly enjoyed it. It is a clean, soothing atmosphere with reasonably fast and friendly service. 

I suggest the Thai Yellow Curry (I am a meat-eater, but I get this dish with tofu)
Shrimp Summer Rolls with mildly spiced peanut sauce, and the traditional Thai Tea to drink."}
{"text":"The place was decent, the waiter and server gave attitude. And our food arrived later then people who came after us. The stuffed chicken wings was good, soup was ok, beef curry wasn't good. Beef wasn't fresh and was very chewy instead of tender. The curry sauce was good. The seafood platter could've been better. Overall I wouldn't come here until they get better management."}
{"text":"First time here as my party and I were visiting from Los Angeles. The Thai iced tea was soooo good and so were the cheese wontons."}
{"text":"This is the second time that I've gotten take-out on a Monday here and it will be the last. Maybe the weekends are better, but the Monday cook appears to have a fear of frying. The crab wontons were tasty, but a little pale. The Vietnamese crepe was inedible. The crepe was so undercooked that it had no color at all and tasted like floury paste. The filling tasted like it had been microwaved (ever so briefly).Maybe the crepe was, too. There was no trace of coconut flavor in the crepe or any seasonings of any kind in either the crepe or the filling. One star for the fresh herbs and lettuce in a separate container and the bright dressing/sauce. Where have you people who gave this place 5 stars been eating? This is the first time I've posted a terrible review, but I had to throw my food away! Last time I only threw half of it away because I was hungry and the vegetables were edible. I don t think I have the stomach for a third strike."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for lunch today and as usual the food was good. I ordered a yellow chicken curry dish, which came with rice and a salad and a soup. I would give this place more stars, but the service was not up to par. I'm not sure if the food server was tired, or just did not want to work, but whatever the reason, she should have stayed home. At first I thought it was just my table, but then I noticed that other customers were having problems with her as well, for example she kept forgetting to bring forks to one table."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai/Asian place on the west side. Great food and the service is AMAZING. I've been here 4 times and each time its gets better. For example tonight they were busy. And the service did not miss beat. Our food was out in minutes. I was not expecting it to be so fast. And it was delicious. Got the summer mango rolls and country chicken pad Thai. Great place. Good prices. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"One of my goto Thai places.  Fast delivery and consistent quality.  A lot of bang for the buck with huge portions.  It is not too spicey, so definitely ask for for more spice to get it right."}
{"text":"I agree with the last reviewer and I can say the Summer rolls are fantastic.  As far as I know this is the only Thai place in the Area and on the outside it is pretty plain but the food is authentic and very tasty.  I have beed here 4 times over the past couple of months and had stuck to the Traditional Pad Thai.  This last time I went I had the Mango Chicken and I have to say I was extremely pleased.  Great flavors, don't be put off by the store front or the lack of patrons, it usually isnt busy til around 7pm.  Great Food good service and reasonable prices.  I would recommend to any Thai Food lover in the Westlake area that doesnt want to travel to Berea."}
{"text":"This has been one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas for the past several years. Just off the strip, it is easy to get to. 
The fried shrimp appetizer was large (7 or 8 breaded jumbo shrimp) and tasty. My wife's (pork) Larb was nicely prepared and spicy, while my Lemon chicken was just ok. We arrived at 5 pm, and as such, our plum wine and Singha beer  were 1/2 price. I always appreciate the Happy hour discount! My order seemed just a tad bland this time around and my wife insists that the menu changed slightly (ie, deleted a few items) since the last time we were here, which is why I only gave 4 stars this time. Hopefully in the future Thai Spice will give me a reason to resume their 5-star rating."}
{"text":"I love Thai food and am so excited to move closer to this little gem. I've only had it once, but the curry was a touch spicy and deliciously coconutty. My husband loved the Pad Thai and he ate every last bite, he is a selfish, selfish man. We only got the take out, but the restaurant seemed nice. I can't wait to make it my go to carry out place!"}
{"text":"I had the panang curry and pad thai.  Both were delicious and the service was great.  I like how the panang curry had kaffir lime leaves which was a great touch that not many thai places have."}
{"text":"Great food... awesome staff...NEVER DISAPPOINTED with a visit to this great establishment."}
{"text":"My family and I LOVE this restaurant. We've been coming here every Christmas Eve for about 5 years now. We bring our own wine and just spend the night chatting and eating delicious Thai food. The owner knows us and always comes out to greet us! 

This place is just very cozy and quaint. We normally get potstickers, spring rolls and summer rolls to start with and take home. My sister is a vegetarian and gets the vegetarian rainbow full of fresh veggies. My dad gets Massaman curry with duck and brown rice. My other sister and I always get the Pad Thai dish. It's just so good, we can't get anything else! I've been to Thailand before and the Pad Thai a woman made me right in front of me tastes almost identical to the one here. Very friendly staff, takes reservations and pick-up orders, amazing food, and a great atmosphere.

I definitely recommend this cute Thai restaurant for a nice evening out!"}
{"text":"Nothing overwhelming here - seems pretty generic. Food was passable but I have had better. Was more chinese than thai."}
{"text":"Easily our favorite Viet/Thai mom n pop on West Side. All the Apps are terrific. Try the Shrimp in a Blanket- very simple & sweet. Mango Curry is premier entree, not Pad Thai. Shrimp Fried Rice is a solid choice.
I could eat the $9 Vietnamese Rice Plate 7 days a week. Try it w/ Pork and/or Shrimp. Owners are former Lemongrass Chef & his wife, a hard-working & dear woman - but restaurant is understaffed at times when their college age daughters are not around to help. Your patience will be rewarded."}
{"text":"Tasty establishment off the strip. Great service and the food is good. Thai spiced beef was really good & everything is fresh."}
{"text":"Ok yelp this is my first time coming to Thai spice. The restaurant is very nice in the inside it was kind of slow it was my boyfriend and one other gentleman. Our waitress was nice. For a appetizer me and my boyfriend ordered the stuff chicken wings it was really good some Thai restaurants dont offer the stuff chicken wings on there menu so that was a plus. For the main dish I ordered Tom Kha it was really good and the flavor was awesome it had a lot of chicken. My only complaints are that the food here is over priced and my soup didn't come with rice I had to ask usually  it comes with rice."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to go to Thai Spice for a year now and finally went tonight.  We had a wonderful dinner! 

I had the Pad Thai. It is not as sweet as other places I have had it, and I really enjoyed that. My dinning companion had the Cashew Chicken. Wow what a generous portion!  We started our dinner with the Spring Rolls. They were wonderful, and the dipping sauce is to die for.

The staff was very friendly. 

I can not wait to go back."}
{"text":"The Tom Yum Soup with Shrimp still has a lot of shrimps hehee, the padi thai this time around was good not great and the thai iced tea still taste damn good hehee."}
{"text":"went for the bubble tea and pho.... waited for like 10 mins for someone to come seat us... they didn't so we seated ourselves only to be yelled at by the waitress who got to us saying they seat us and it's not seat yourselves- felt it was unprofessional and rude. 

ordered brisket pho..... the soup lacked flavor and the waitress could not tell me what the lighter whiter colored chunks of meat or tofu were... she said all i can get out of \"them\" is that its beef. i'm like ok i feel real comfortable eating this.....

ordered the black tea bubble tea... they were out.... ordered mango.... out..... ordered taro... had it .

won't come back"}
{"text":"After waiting so long for the reopening, Thai Spice was a big disappointment. The food was bland, unoriginal, and pretty much what I don't look for in Thai food.  Going with a group of friends mostly versed in Thai food, we proclaimed that Thai Spice won't be a reoccurring lunch spot.  We ordered the Pad See Ew ($9.95, and had some goofy name on the menu), the Green Curry Beef ($10.95), the Larb Pork ($9.96), the Chicken Fried Rice ($9.95), and the One Sun Beef jerky ($8.95).  Everything was ordered with \"medium spice\" and \"Thai style\".

The Pad See Ew was served without Chinese broccoli as an option. The sauce was some sort of a generic Chinese style teriyaki sauce.  The chicken was bland.  There was no spice, and even with gobs of their chili powder (which we had to ask for), there still wasn't much flavor or heat.  Pad See Ew is an easy dish, and somehow Thai Spice still makes it bland.  Unfortunately, this was the best dish of the meal.

The Green Curry with Beef was also a miss.  Lightly sweet and without much flavor at all, or spice, it was boring to eat.  Just plain boring.  The occasional bell pepper was the only thing that gave this dish any interesting flavor. I have had worst tasting curries, but this one was probably one of the blandest curries I have ever had.  What's the point of eating this again?

The Larb with Pork was border line gross.  It was the most offensive dish that we had, and one of my friends just plain couldn't stand it.  The flavor was off.  It had a lot of vinegar, along with a poorly balanced blend of herbs that were just totally unappealing.  Again, no heat at all to even cover up the bad flavor.  Do yourself a favor and don't order the larb here.

The chicken fried rice was unoffensive.  It was also bland as heck.  The chicken was dry, and there was no flavor to speak of.  Is this food for 5 year olds?

Yeah, the jerky wasn't good either.  The sauce was uninspiring and overly salty.  The meat tasted of poor quality.  I had to convince my one friend who had never had Thai jerky before that it is actually really good at some other places.

Thai Spice is some of the most bland \"Thai\" food I have ever had, and Americanized to boot.  There were a lot of Chinese dishes on the menu.  You might want to just stick to the Chinese stuff.  If you're looking for Thai flavors, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Red curry chicken is delish. My last visit I ordered the coconut shrimp and was really impressed. The batter was loaded with fresh coconut and they give you a generous portion (8-9 I think). I wasn't impressed with the glass noodle soup but everyone else really liked it. The staff are extremely friendly and have always had my take out orders ready for me."}
{"text":"I love the lunch specials here it's a great value,soup salad, small egg roll, main dish with rice for under 11 dollars. The food was very good I had the chicken curry it was not the best I've had but it is in the top ten. The portions were on the large size so come hungry or be prepared to bring some home. The service was great staff was happy and nice and very quick to serve. I didn't have any wine with my meal but I did did look at the beer and wine menu and I was surprised how extensive the menu was and what a low mark up there was. Decor was nice and for as many people there was for lunch it was a fairly quiet atmosphere when a person could have a conversation without shouting."}
{"text":"I had garlic chicken and my friend had pad thai. We both thought our meals we're tasteless. 

The service was slow and non-personal. The piped in electronic 70s music: hideous.

And it was expensive."}
{"text":"Thai Spice is my favorite Thai restaurant in the area. I love their more traditional items. The mint leaf chicken is awesome. If you like spicy, this is a great choice, but can choose spice level from 1-10. The larb is great and the soups awesome - as well as the satay chicken with yummy peanut sauce. The owner/hostess is welcoming and friendly. 

Note: I was turned on to this place on a visit with my Mom and Sister and after returning to LV for about 7 years, found this the best in the area.  The food is very authentic."}
{"text":"Genuine Thai and Vietnamese cuisine at reasonable prices. What else can you ask for. Had the coconut chicken soup as appetizer and red curry with beef as entre. Colleague ordered pho and another order Pad Thai. We were all very satisfied with our orders."}
{"text":"I will definitely eat at Thai Spice again!  The food was very good.  We started with the Summer Rolls - one vegetarian and one regular with shrimp.  These were spot on and very good!  We got the Lemon Grass Soup - very nice balance - with lots of flavor.  I got the Thai string beans with Tofo -- this was outstanding.  Tofu was cooked to perfection!  My companion got the Seafood Basil Fried Rice ... he got it extra hot and they spiced it up perfect for him.  I tried it and it was outstanding!  The only thing I wasn't a fan on was the Jasmine green tea... not really good. Service was outstanding!  Also the place seems very clean!  This location had several restaurants with really bad reputations -- all that disappears after experiencing Thai Spice!"}
{"text":"I have yet to dine here, but I've tried the bubble tea and bubble slushies and they are FANTASTIC! 

Tons of flavors: stawberry, strawberry banana, cappachino, cantaloupe, honeydew, durian, coconut, pina colada, green apple, peach, mango, green tea, milk tea, jazmin green tea, jazmin milk tea, almond milk tea, mango tea, lychee tea, passion fruit tea, endless options. You can walk right in, order your tea or slushies and walk right out! 

$3.50 for a large (one size only)

If you haven't tried bubble tea, your missing out! If your in the mood for something different, fun and delicious get a bubble tea or slushy!!!"}
{"text":"I'm extremely confused as to why this place has anything lower than an overall 5 star rating. It's the BEST Thai I have had in Cleveland. Nothing fancy, great for a casual meal or take out and their food is the bomb. I thought for sure I would have leftovers but I couldnt stop eating and then we even ordered dessert! The basil fried rice is totally amazing and so are their dumpling appetizers. Dessert was out of this world with the fried coconut ice cream. Just YES. Go!"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai food in Vegas! Everything we've tried is fantastic from the pad Thai to the beef and broccoli to the coconut curry soup."}
{"text":"The Thai food was mediocre and bland compared to Thai food I've had in other cities, but the atmosphere, service, and friendliness of the staff was appreciated."}
{"text":"There are no Thai people in sight. This is the applebees of thai. Such a shame.
The food was pretty awful. 

I'm a little embarrassed for the owner Lemongrass is so good but this place is really bad. I think I will be sticking to the hole in the wall Thai Kitchen to get my Thai fix. It's cheaper and the food is far superior to this culinary disaster. 

Don't eat here. There are any number of better Thai restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Nice casual atmosphere, pleasant ambiance. The staff is very friendly, and helpful with the menu but stuck to the strict \"no substitutions\" rule. I ordered a reasonably priced lunch special, Chicken Chow Mein. It came with a really tasty soup (rice and veggies in broth.) The lunch portion was more than enough for me, but I did make one mistake. I ordered my dish at a level 7 spicy. Apparently I have a weaker tongue than I thought. It was so spicy I couldn't finish more than a few bites (and I'm STILL sniffling 20 minutes later.) But, the saving grace was the tiny egg roll that came on the plate. It was amazing. I'd go back with friends to give it a second try, but I've learned my lesson with the spice!"}
{"text":"I've come here twice already. To even it out I gave them 3 stars since my first visit was a 5 and my second visit was a 2. 

OUR FIRST VISIT
couldn't have been better! We came here on a whim one night for dinner when we happened to just be driving around trying to find a place to eat. We walked in here and the place was completely empty, but we were greeted with big smiles and seated right away while another server was already filling up our glasses with water. Usually I find it a little awkward to be the only customers since the servers tend to just stare or or look annoyed and it also seems like the place is empty because it probably isn't good, but that wasn't the case for this place. The fact that we were alone in there actually made it quite nice since we got complete attention and excellent service. 

We ordered the Nevada Chicken - Tender, boneless, chicken breast fillet in a light curry-peanut sauce for $7.95
and
Pad Thai - Soft pan-fried translucent noodles cooked with chicken, shrimp, ground peanuts and ground chili pepper. Garnished with fresh bean sprouts for $7.95

The Nevada Chicken was so sexy! Juicy chicken breast with peanut sauce. It makes me salivate just thinking about it! It was exactly like the description.  It even came with a side of white rice which was nice since we didn't order any rice with our meal. We both loved it!

The Pad Thai I just couldn't get enough of. All of the different flavors and textures in it went together so well in my mouth, mmm! I loved the crunchiness of the peanuts and bean sprouts, it definitely added to the burst of flavors. 

Normally we would've ordered more than just two plates of food, like an appetizer and dessert and probably thai tea, but this was more than enough for us. We were able to finish it all without having to take anything home, which was good since we were staying at a hotel on the strip that night anyway. The portion filled us up just right and we were oh so satisfied!
 

THE SECOND VISIT
Pure disappointment... 

The service was, well, lacking SERVICE. It took them at least 10 minutes to greet us and give us a place to sit. The place wasn't even full, probably just a 3rd of it was full and that was just on the left side where they were seating everyone. Their greeting wasn't exactly welcoming. We were standing at the front of the restaurant waiting to be seated and the girl just came up to us and said \"can I help you?\" WTH. It's a restaurant, I think it's an obvious reason as to why anyone would be in there, but I wasn't about to say \"yes you can help me by filling my stomach and quitting your job so I don't have to see your face again,\" so I just bit my tongue and said \"table for 3.\" 

We were seated and we decided what to order right away since it was just off the lunch special menu, but it took forever to finally get our order relayed since the waitress just sat us then neglected us. It seemed as though she even avoided us while we were calling her at some points since she'd look at us and just turn away. She finally came and she just seemed to be in another dimension or something. We told her \"we want the pepper steak level 4\" then she said \"okay level 4, what level spicy?\" That was just confusing. We went back and forth a few times repeating what level we wanted then she'd repeat that same question. She got the rest of our order and left. 

I don't remember what else we ordered other than pepper steak and pad thai. That might've been it actually. We got to orders of pad thai since my bf and my brother both wanted their order spicy (level 8) and I can't go higher than a 4 lol. 

Since it took so long for the food to come, we decided we wanted to get an appetizer AND we also wanted our glasses of water filled since the cups were already empty for a while and the ice was starting to melt. We kept signaling to the waitress but she's just walk by and look the other way or look at us and look away, it was really awkward, we were beginning to wonder if we were just trippin' or if it was her. We all agreed it was her, ha. Maybe it was just that she was too young and couldn't handle multitasking. Whatever it was definitely didn't leave a good impression on us. 

The pad thai was good, but not great like the first time we went.   The pepper steak I don't even remember, so it mustn't have been all that great. We never  get our appetizer, so I can't comment on that. 

It kinda sucked because my boyfriend and I took my brother here to eat because we had such a good experience with bombass food the first time we came so we thought he'd love it too, but they totally flipped it on us and made it a bad experience with bad service and mediocre food. We had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing, but was quickly disappointed. He even said it wasn't as good as we were telling him and we told him we didn't expect it to be like this. 

I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"The quality has went way way down and the price up of course! As you see no green garnish NO Brussels sprouts very little meat as well don't know what is going on with ownership but the need to step up the quality or step out of business they won't last much longer with this type of food being served...sorry to see you guys failing I wish we can get a refund but we got to go and don't want to waste gas driving back to eat somewhere else CAN I GET A REFUND OR REPLACE MY FOOD PLEASE???"}
{"text":"Place 3 stars - The place and its design looked old. It is for sure not for a place to have a romantic dinner.

Service 3 stars - Our server was not a Thai server and barely knew about Thai food. She was somewhat short...not the best service but not bad. Just mediocre.

Food 3 stars for flavor and 2.5 stars for value - We ordered summer roll with shrimp. The rice wrapper doesn't get enough water soaked. It was kind of hard to chew. For the Entree, we ordered Red curry with chicken and chicken cashew nut. The curry tasted alright but the ingredients were so plane. Food decoration was definitely needed to be improved. The chicken cashew nut was so weird. It had pineapple in and very watery. The chicken was overcooked in both dishes."}
{"text":"I always order the spring rolls. The sauces are super yummy but they are missing the rice noodles. Also asked for hot sauce with my to go order didn't get it."}
{"text":"The best pad thai I've ever had. Its not overly saucy like some places. I really miss this place and I've been on the hunt for a good Thai place and have yet to find one that compares to Thai Spice.This was one of the few restaurants where I felt comfortable trying new dishes. The dishes here are consistently good. The price is fair."}
{"text":"This place has good pad thai and other dishes, the portions could be a tad bigger in my opinion but the food is always tasty.  We typically call in our order and pick it up to go since we live close by so I can't speak to the decor or service.  All in all, a great westside thai option!"}
{"text":"Pretty ok place. 
But honestly I question a restaurant that combines two very different culinary traditions.
That being said, I noticed images of the King of Thailand were missing or were not prominently displayed. The condiments normally found on tables in Thai restaurants were also missing.
I went with the Bun dish with beef and added the spring rolls.
The spring rolls were used a skin not normally used in Vietnamese Imperial rolls, which are made from rice paper. The beef in this bun dish was tasty, but lacked the familiar flavor I am accustomed to. The nuoc cham was surprisingly good.
Over all good."}
{"text":"Just ordered their lunch take out special. It was supposed to be about $5 per order, and two orders came to $20. Very odd math there. Chicken fried rice was atrocious. Greasy, and had big cashews and pineapple chunks in it. Ordered a 7 on the hot scale, and it was not even a 1. Thai Beef was also very bland and basically tasted like old gray meat that had seen better days. I mean, if you're going to serve awful meat, at least spice it up a bit. I still cannot scrape the greasy paste off of my palate from this meal. There are much better Thai places in town to spend your money/time on."}
{"text":"Impressed with the food however the wait really weighed heavily on my rating. If you got the time, definitely eat here!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The panang curry and spicy Thai basil with ground chicken (and be sure to get it Thai hot). I think it's referred to as Gra Prow. Family owned and operated. Casual atmosphere, good food and good prices."}
{"text":"Suprisingly, the pad thai woonsen was great. I'm originally from Thailand, so i have high expectation when order Thai food. I see this resturant has Thai name on each dish, so i guessed the owner must be Thai.  Love the Pad Thai woonsen!!! But i also ordered the Tom Kha khai as well doesnt taste as good as i had at other places."}
{"text":"Nobody checked on me for the whole meal. Need a fork? Flag someone down! Need a straw? Flag someone down! Virtually no service (but I'm a solo visitor; tables with two or more seem to be getting help). 

It is busy, and claims to be rated \"best of Vegas since 2014.\" (Not sure who voted). 

The hot tea is adequate and the tofu was just \"okay.\" The lemon sauce used was too light and lacked flavor. The rice is standard. 

Cost wise, a meal for one (entree and tea) is about $15. 

They had lunch specials for $8 but they didn't have any dishes I liked for sale. 

I may or may not return for take out! It was \"meh\" for food and awful for service."}
{"text":"If good service is essential to a satisfying dining experience, this isn't the place for you. If you can deal with the fact that maybe no one will greet you for ten minutes (or maybe they will), the person at the front will handle the carryout orders only and pretend you're not even standing there (or maybe s/he won't), and your server won't really be able to explain many of the entrees (of maybe s/he will), then you'll experience some top-notch food. We've really liked everything we've had here and when we're in the mood for delicious food mingled with good-or-bad service, we'll go back again!"}
{"text":"I was invited to eat at this restaurant for lunch with a co-worker because she knows one of the people who owns the business. I don't eat much Thai food or think about eating it often but when it's offered of course! Upon arriving it was pretty dead maybe two or three other customer's dining. We were seated promptly which is always a plus. For appetizers we went with the shrimp wontons and the stuffed chicken wings. The order came out pretty quick as we weren't even ready to order the main entrée, but when we did the curry chicken and seafood pad thai were the choices. If you are here for the lunch special I highly encourage to order off that menu because the prices for dinner are about double and maybe even more. The larp was another addition to our order because my co worker suggested it pairs well with sticky rice. All in all the food was okay but the reason I would rate this place 3 stars is because when the bill came we were given a 20% discount instead of the meal being complimentary like we were told prior to arriving. Keeping your word as a business owner is very important if you would like to keep regular customers. This was my first and last time eating here because being tricked into a meal wasn't on my agenda for yesterday's lunch date. Don't tell somebody \"oh come to my restaurant and I will take care of you and order whatever you want\" then turn around and slap a bill down with a measly 20% off?..  I'll pass!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best yellow curry I've ever had. There are many reasons why you would enjoy this place, but they main reason here is their food and prices. Let's talk about chicken, their chicken Curry is out of this world guys, not only it's creamy and cut just right in a way that it melts in your mouth, but I it's spiciness is just right too.

Now, the place could look a little bit more modern, yet we are near by Chinatown so you know how thugs roll over there. This is Las Vegas baby, so let's keep the expectations low and focus on their food right? Yeah, let's do that. So, read on:

Thai Spicy is also right by a Starbucks, a MC Donald's and a Burger-king. So hey, their competition is there ;) but they still survive by being a small and delicious traditional looking Thai restaurant! How about that? Give it a shot and you won't be disappointed. I often have lunch there with my co workers!"}
{"text":"I have to say Thai Spice was not what I expected. I must agree with a review I read before I ordered from here. It is like a fast  food Thai restaurant. There is nothing authentic about it at all. I ordered the Seafood fried rice and it tasted fishy and smelled fishy. There was nothing fresh about it at all. The tofu triangles were burnt and the sauces for my meals were cold. I expected to walk into a authentic Thai experience but all I got was a McDonalds experience. I will never go there again. I'm not a picky eater and I don't accept throwing food away. Most of the time if the food is bad I'll eat it now and taste it later just for the nutrient value but I had to force this food down. Too bad..... I really wanted too enjoy it.  I must saythis, It was extremely quiet when I walked in to pick up my food because no one was there"}
{"text":"This evening on Labor Day we drove over for dinner to Thai Spice. This is a very attractive restaurant and I give it a big red Yelp star for the space between tables. You know I like my space.
We shared two appetizers: pot stickers and Cham Nan which is lightly fried shrimp and pork. Tasty!!
We decided to split the $19.95 Siamese Duckling. It was tender and delicious.
They serve the 21 ounce Singha beer and other beers plus wines.
This restaurant is pretty close to our neighborhood so we will check out other entrees very soon."}
{"text":"Love this place pad Thai !! 
Best in town!! Looks like a family owned and operated ,, best kind of place"}
{"text":"Every time I have this place it is so good, never disappoints! Everything I have tried has been so flavorful and cooked so well! Must try everything, especially their pad Thai! :)"}
{"text":"Let me just say that I love Thai food. I've had take-out from here quite a few times, but have never sat down and eaten.  The first couple times I liked it and thought that the food was decent enough.  The last time I had it though, I was very disappointed.  I had the Pad Thai and it was extremely dry.  The chicken was way overcoooked and the dish tasted flavorless to me. I will say that they have very good spring rolls and i've always been satisfied with them, but I think it may be time to find another Thai place in town."}
{"text":"Service was not up to par. When we arrived we were the first ones in the restaurant..., however, everyone who walked in after us were being helped out first. We ordered the Szechuan chicken and the pepper garlic. Both were fantastic! My favorite thing was the Thai tea. It's a must have!"}
{"text":"I come here for dinner. This Restaurant is good too and foods really nice also good service and friendly.  I think l will back again for lunch. Coz they have special lunch set. Let's see."}
{"text":"On the same scale as Archie's everything is very fresh and the curry dishes were amazing"}
{"text":"Called in a carry out got there right on time they said 10 more minutes. Ok. At the 30 minute mark I asked they said ten more, at the 55 minute mark they came out and said the lost my order. I guess I will never know if the food is good I walked out"}
{"text":"The food is pretty decent and right about what you'd expect to pay for some exotic cuisine. The presentation they put effort in, nice blends of spices.

It's a small venue, can be awkward in there when busy. There's really no waiting area so I just felt in the way. I could tell the staff was overwhelmed, everything was slow. Additionally the host/waitress just had a poor, salty attitude. I think from now on if I go here it's take out only. The inside is not properly suited to accommodate. Foods good though."}
{"text":"I was starving and I love Thai so I thought I would try this place. My stomach was eating itself while I waited over 30 min for my two orders of tofu panang to go to come up. 30 min was a lot! I had to get two orders cuz they had a $10 min credit card charge and my order was like $9.60. I finally got my order and rushed home to eat it. The Tofu was fried, hard & gross! I don't think anywhere I've gotten this dish (I get it a lot) has the tofu been fried and if it was it was lightly fried. I'm so upappitized thinking about that fat from the fried tofu clinging to my arteries. Anyway, I was gonna take back my second order to tell them to make it again unfried but who knows how long it would take and I never send food back(have you seen the movie waiting? Gross). DONT GO HERE, GO TO THAI BBQ- its close & way better!"}
{"text":"Stay away not a Thai place!!! It's a fast food over priced Chinese spot. Don't be mislead!! warning!!"}
{"text":"Thai Spice is one of my favorite restaurants.  I have been coming here since the early 90's.   It's always great to go to a restaurant where they know what you want to eat as soon as you walk in the door.  Great food & Service."}
{"text":"Chicken pad thai very good.  Had a 3 first time so went for a 2 this time and added my own pepper. Chicken very tender tonight.  Yum. Great service!"}
{"text":"I've always been happy with the food we've gotten here. From Pad Thai to Mango Chicken and Basil Chicken, but we haven't been since we heard about all of their health code violations :/ also their prices are too high for what it is. Can't comment on the service because we always get takeout, but quality tasting food overall."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch because the girlfriend wanted Thai, and we happened to be in the area. It's in an unassuming plaza, but the interior is a bit more welcoming.

A quick glance at the yelp reviews steered me away from even trying the pad thai (which is probably the first time I've ever NOT ordered it at a Thai place), and I went with the Mango chicken curry. It wasn't the best but it was good, it was filling, and at under $8 it's a win for me. My girlfriend ordered the beef massaman curry which I don't really like, but she said it was ok if not lacking... something. We also had some summer rolls, which were good although the wrap was really sticky and the shrimp was just a little bit on the small side.

They make some bomb ass bubble tea smoothies though. Huge portions, wider variety than your average restaurant, and smooth, delicious boba.

Overall, it really wasn't bad, but I can't say I would ever return... at least for anything other than the bubble tea."}
{"text":"Their bubble tea is the best in all of Cuyahoga County. (the almond milk tea is to die for). Best prices and quality! Doesn't taste artificial like all the other places. Love love love!!"}
{"text":"We had the basil eggplant and the salmon in a pepper curry sauce and both dishes were deeply delicious. The service was very attentive and everything we had was of the best tasting food we've ever had. The place is not necessarily beautiful but if you're going for the food this is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"This place has the greatest food and the friendliest staff. The food is always fresh ( not like a lot of Chinese restaurants that serve old vegetables ) The atmosphere is great and the prices are affordable. If your looking for a place to take a date, then you can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"came here for lunch. i order the mint chicken with came with soup, salad and egg roll. when we arrive we were greeted right away. the place seem pretty busy for lunch. after our order the soup came first. it was a egg flower soup. then following the entree with a side salad and egg roll. wow, the mint chicken was super delish and it was a really generous portion! i ate everything on my plate haha so good. place was clean staff was nice! well be back!"}
{"text":"Love coming here for their fried rice and my to go orders are always on point. Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"pad see ew is so good as are almost all of the appetizers (i haven't tried them all). Rely on this place for take out for my family at least once a week. Menu is simple but ingredient are fresh and flavor is there. Also, the location is quick and easy for pick up or a quick stop for dinner. My favorite Asian food on the west side of cleveland for sure."}
{"text":"Food is great and staff is friendly.  Would be a solid 4 maybe almost a five but I have a big problem with this place.  Recently, they have cut there servings almost in half.  When asked why they said price of meet has gone up.  This is not true though!  See gas prices have been going down in turn cost of food has slightly decreased.  I asked for same amount and had to pay $2 more for a lunch special.  Not a special anymore!!  Wake up Thai Spice, you will loss business by trying to cut corners and it will hurt you much more than giving a little extra away."}
{"text":"Not too shabby for Westlake! 

I enjoyed mostly the waitstaff of this restaurant. A very friendly vietnamese woman. The woman was taken by surprised that I was vietnamese my self and offered me a job right on the spot--but sadly, I told her I was only visiting the Cleveland area for a few days. 

Food: I got the Thai Basil Fried Rice with Seafood---it was very delicious. The owners are Vietnamese...and do a pretty decent job of cooking Thai food. They do have bubble tea here. Thai Tea--was not made. It was one of those powder package thai tea. Mango Sticky rice was also good too. 

Very clean restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was good when it finally came.  Portions were small.  They had no staff working.  Waited 20 minutes to place drink order.  Probably will not go back."}
{"text":"Love their tofu and veggie dishes. Everything is always so good and fresh. My favorite is the Tofu Salad Bowl."}
{"text":"I went tonight and was very impressed. They had amazing service and where kind enough to accommodate my bf and I even though they were closing. I am very particular when I order my food and they nailed it!!! My bf and I loved their shrimp fried rice and will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time tonight.   The other reviews hit it - this is Americanized Thai food.  I have to say it was good, some dishes were better than others.    The chicken satay was excellent, great peanut sauce and a sweet sauce with it.    The hot oil is great - my new favorite.  

We also had a a pork / green bean / sweet pea curry.  It was ok - I'd call it Americanized.   Given the other reviews, I ordered it 'Thai Hot' and it wasn't all that spicy - glad I had the forethought to order a side of hot oil.  

I didn't care at all for their Tom Kha Kai (coconut soup).  It was very chicken brothy.  I'm used to the coconut-laden soup from Charm Thai.

We'll be back and will try different items to lock-in on what's spicy."}
{"text":"Was staying nearby, walked over and a very nice woman took my take-out order, Szechwan Chicken, spicy made to order on a 1-10 scale. $11.85 including tax. Rice included. Pik attached. Was good, I'd return. I see they have some pretty good lunch specials from 11a to 3:30p."}
{"text":"Thai spice is simply delicious!

We stop here to eat lunch after a work meeting and I think it was THE best idea ever!

The service was very quick and our waitress was on top of everything, including filling our waters up!  One thing that I was truly intrigued by was the different types of bubble tea they offered.  I didn't order one during this visit, but it is on my bucket list to go back and try them!

My food was so good!  I am still dreaming about it!  I ordered the vegetrain summer roll to start and the tofu pad thai for my main course.  I ordered the pad thai as Thai hot and it was spicy- just how I like it!

If you are looking for a place that is quick during the lunch hour and it isn't a fast food restaurant, I highly suggest Thai Spice.  They have a varity of options on their menu especially for vegan/vegetarian folks.  I will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here on and off for years, and is a wonderful place!  This review isn't for a specific experience... just overall have had very good food at this location.  I tend to eat mostly from the vegetarian menu, some of the soups or spring rolls and tofu curries... or the occasional sea food dish.  All have been great!  Plus it's never too loud or crowded, people are friendly and I've never had very slow service (although it's not super fast, you can tell things are generally made fresh).  

Not sure how it ranks with 'authentic' Thai (which some Thai friends told me essentially doesn't exist perfectly here in Cleveland), but still very tasty food nevertheless."}
{"text":"When we first moved to Cleveland, there was a dearth of Thai dining, and what there was didn't really impress us.  Places like Thai Spice have come in to fill that void, for which I am very grateful. 

The evening we ate here the dining room was almost empty, though a brisk take-out business kept the waitresses busy.  My husband pronounced the coconut shrimp some of the best he'd ever eaten.  My red curry was tasty and spicy without too much heat - if you like it hot, be sure to speak up.

The dining room is nothing special and has a bit of a diner feel, but it's clean and pleasant.  In all, a good place for a quick Thai meal."}
{"text":"Adding up  a star for deliciousness...coconuts and beef soups are out of this world  good! Plus Halloween is over, funky girl is gone and place radiates cultural warmth...I am willing to add another star but only if  shabby Greyhound station-look-a-like decor changes. Please consider."}
{"text":"2 years later and just very dirty. Eat at your own risk. Even the Bubble Tea has become bad.  health Inspector needs to check this place out."}
{"text":"I'm surprised the reviews here are so across the board.  I used to go here a lot when I lived in the area, and I thought it was really good.  I was in the area looking for a meal tonight, and thought I'd give Thai Spice a spin to see if it was still good.  Brought my date and another couple, and we all enjoyed our meal.  Service was amazingly quick... like, I don't know how they brought our food so fast.  Did they predict what we were gonna order and pre-cook it?  My pad thai was a perfect spiciness and had a great flavor.  It's definitely not the cheapest thai food in town, but the portion sizes make up for it."}
{"text":"Had great expectations of this place because a friend had recommended this place! Was served under cooked pork larb! I need not say anymore!"}
{"text":"Food is flavorful and good.  Service is not the best. Waitresses seem to be bodered when you ask for something and they said they only have 2 woks, so my orders can't come together."}
{"text":"The food is exquisite. We have been several times and we are always satisfied. Personally, the Thai Tempura, the Siam Seafood and Seafood Choo Chee are my favorites! 
If they are somewhat busy, expect quite the delay. We have been in both situations and when they are busy, we get our appetizers with the entree and sometimes still missing things. Just be aware."}
{"text":"Best. Ever. The coconut chicken soup (tom ka khai) is delicious, as are their various curries, though I always go for a tofu choo chee. Service is great when you dine in and orders are made reasonably fast for take out. Authentic and delicious!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was very clean. Staff was friendly and helpful in recommending menu choices.  I ordered Thai Basil Fried Rice with seafood.  The taste was authentic and favorful.  The fresh basil leaves made this dish sing. There were generous portions of scallops, shrimp, and calamari in the fried rice. I give them a rating of 5 for good quality and tastyful food, a clean environment and friendly servers. Don't be deterred by the strip mall location.  The food and service is very good."}
{"text":"food is good, but the waitress Lise was very rude and after asking her politely to change my order before the other lady started it, she looked at me as if i was stupid and out of my mind lol. She then told me she let her know but of course i got my original order, EVEN thought i let her know before she started to make it. She clearly doesn't care about her customers especially since i wasn't eating there to give her tip. That should never matter, treat us how you want to be treated! If she wants better tip she needs to smile more and lose that attitude! Just giving her advise bc that was the most worst experience. I would for sure go back for the food, but not the service."}
{"text":"love this place for lunch take out, the food is amazing, well prepared and well seasoned, this is the best rice I have had outside of Asia.
if your looking for a healthy choice at a reasonable price this is a great spot"}
{"text":"Went to another eatery but they were closed so, I said let's try this Thai place. OMG!!!! We ordered veggie egg rolls. They were piping hot and freshly made. I ordered the shrimp chow mein and my hubby got Chili Beef!  Both were excellent!  It's just after 6pm on a Friday night and we can't believe we were the only diners. Although we loved the VIP service!  :)"}
{"text":"Just ate there. Clean place and the service was outstanding!  Excellent menu choices.  I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"I had few expectations, so color me pleasantly surprised.

If you guessed that Thai Spice serves Thai food, you'd be absolutely correct. They're one of the older establishments in its cuisine in Las Vegas, having started in 1994 and been named as best Thai restaurant by something or other through 2007. It's easy to take the cynical guess that they went downhill after that point, but they're still around in a market notorious for turnover, aren't they?

What first caught my attention during the meal, other than the warm if quaint decor, was the true family-run aspect. Younger seemed to be playing behind the counter, and older ones were helping with various duties. My water certainly stayed full for most of the night. It's easy to root for a place like this to succeed, which is perhaps part of their charm

I didn't plan to go crazy for this meal, so I just shared a couple of dishes to get the lay of the land.

Green Curry with Chicken ($10.95): this isn't anything to write home about, and it's not actually that green, but it's a solid take on the dish. Zucchini may not be traditional, but it was an especially juicy and fun addition. Chicken was white meat all the way. Rice was fine, and spiciness of 3 out of 10 actually tasted mild to me, aside from one concentrated bite.

Thai Spice Beef ($11.95): their namesake dish, and deservedly so. It starts and pretty much with the marinated tender beef, which is predominantly sweet. They don't even ask for a spicy level because it's zero. The other main element is the bed of crispy rice noodles. They don't have much of their own flavor, but they're so crunchy. Perhaps it's not the most traditional or authentic Thai recipe, but I'll take an addictive Americanized dish any day if it's this delicious.

Thai Spice won't ever be my first choice, but only because it's farther from me than several other Thai restaurants. Reactions from elsewhere around the table seemed positive too, and I've jotted a few notes in the back of my head in case I should find myself here again. It's well worth the consideration if you're in the area and want something relatively cheap (and/or walkable from the Palms Casino)."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai restaurants which I have see recently. We went on a trip to vegas, and wanted to eat some Thai Food, and my GPS showed me this restaurant.. It is little bit off from Strip. The interiors of this restaurant is excellent. The restaurant is clean and bright. The food is authentic, tasty, priced reasonable, excellent staff, clean tables.

We ordered 3 Thai Basil Chicken fried rice and 2 Thai Basil Vegei Fried Rice and 1 Thai Basil Egg fried rice. All mty friends were happy and satisfied after seeing and eating the food.

The food quantity here is little bit off when compared to other Thai restaurants I've seen. They give good quantity of food, I would say 2 dishes will be enough for 3 people.

If you are in Vegas and wanted to eat some Tasty Asian food for economical price in a clean place with friendly staff... I recommend visiting this place..."}
{"text":"Best Pad Thai I have ever had!  I have ordered The orange chicken 6 times (kids staple) it is mostly good but has some hard pieces that are overcooked. Wish they would solve that.  Soups are really good."}
{"text":"All time favorite staple Thai restaurant! Great service fresh food . What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"We came here because we were at Huntingdon Beach in Cleveland and this was the closest Thai on Yelp with a decent rating. The food was much better than the 3.5 stars. Authentic and delicious"}
{"text":"No complaints!!  We visited for lunch and the pad thai and pepper steak were delicious!!  The soup that comes before which the waitress called a \"beef soup\" was also very tasty and the other three diners agreed! They ask you to pick your spice level on a scale of 1 to 10 which was pretty cute, so I picked 4 and it was perfect.  Just a tad spicy.  Another person I was with went with a 7 and said that was hot, but perfect!  The waitress said 10 was dangerous. :) 

Food comes quickly, portions are generous, our waitress was very friendly and timely and truly . . . . I have no complaints.  Prices for lunch specials were so reasonable too, I think our bill for the four of us totalled to $28.  

We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is a decent place to eat, both for the quality and the money.

In all honesty it is not quite as good as Archie's, and not in the same league with Lotus Flower of Siam, but it is good food, and as I said above, decent price.

I will confess I did like their Panang Chicken Curry a little better than Archie's because it was tender chicken, and they were more generous with the Curry sauce.

I will say that I will go back there for sure, and that tells you it's worth a trip to try it."}
{"text":"My dinner at Thai Spice was very enjoyable, with no complaints whatsoever.

We ordered the Stuffed Chicken Wings as an appetizer, which were delicious, and a large Coconut Soup. We asked for it spicy and it came mild, but since they provided plenty of sauces to add in it wasn't a problem.

As entrees we chose the Shrimp Pad Thai and Chicken Panang Curry. The curry was served very spicy, as requested, and the pad thai was tasty as well.

All ingredients were fresh, and the service was attentive.

Thai Spice isn't anything super fancy, but the prices are great and the food authentic. If you're in the area definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Ok, not bad.  I actually ordered the pad se ewe (always spelled differently in different regions - funny) and the vegetable curry with chicken and tofu added. I love a good red curry!!  I did order their \"10\" rating for heat.  I'd say it's really about a 6 or a 3 ( on a scale of 1-5...just above medium) in most houses.   Both entrees were tasty but not really memorable.  Would I eat here again, yes.  Is this the best Thai is all of Vegas?  God I hope not.  We have two places is the ABQ that'd blow them away.   

It was a good find none the less and I'd still recommend to the avid Thai food seeker.  I always make a point to try the local Thai in most markets a travel to.  Still haven't found the same consistency that there wAs up in the Detroit are via the local Hmong. :). Their curry is a much darker red and the pad se ewe is also a bi darker in colour and a bit smokier and sweeter.  Just different but excellent."}
{"text":"I visited Thai Spice for dinner one evening. I always want to like a new place I am visiting - and hope I have a great experience. Thai Spice is not going to be in the category of \"great experience\"...

When I arrived - there was a very large party on one side of the dining room - 22 people I counted.

I stood and waited for about 10 minutes before anyone approached me and acknowledged me. It took them another 10 minutes to get me seated. Every single available table had yet to be serviced and cleaned since the previous parties had left.

Finally I got my table. It then took them about 15 minutes to come by and take my order.

I decided to try a spicy beef Pho they had on the menu - normally I am a \"Pho Ga\" person, but I was intrigued by the prospect of a hot and spicy Pho. I also ordered an order of the Summer Rolls.

The Summer rolls were your typical Summer Rolls, nothing overly good or bad about them.

The spicy Pho was rather disappointing. I added a lot of Sriracha sauce to get it to where the heat was where I wanted it to be.

Finally, when I went to pay my bill, I waited for over 10 minutes to pay. A couple in front of me was paying for a \"to-go\" order - and they were friends with the server who was ringing them up - which also happened to be my server. She spent a long time \"chit-chatting\" with them as I am standing there waiting to pay.

When they finally left, she says something like: \"They're friends of mine\" as if somehow this is a valid reason for making me wait. I commented that the restaurant is severely under-staffed. She responded with a comment that often times it's really slow business-wise. Makes me wonder if the service is causing people to stay away - hence the slowness at times. There are several other reviews here where folks are experiencing the same poor service and wait times that I experienced.

I won't be back.

{"text":"The ambiance is probably the best out of all the thai restaurants that I have been to, over the years. I really used to like this restaurant. One time the service was kinda off since we were waiting for another party to join us (they were very late). When I took my husband here, he didn't think too much of it, hence we haven't been back since. One of my good friends who is half thai really likes it, though. We used to get the stuffed chicken wings, pad thai, thai beef salad, and thai iced tea."}
{"text":"I have traveled the great lakes area seeking the greatest thai food and can say conclusively that the greatest thai food cannot be found at this establishment.  While the service was acceptable, the decor was easy on the eyes, and the menu give the restaurant points for having staff that know how to use publishing software, the food lacks intensity.   Typically when I dine at a newly found thai restaurant, the first entree that I get is Pa Nang Curry.    In addition, I ask for extra spicyness.  The Pa Nang Curry from the restaurant Thai Spice was bland and watery.  The rice wasn't the worst rice that I had this week, but it certainly didn't win the restaurant any points.  I give this restaurant 3 stars because I recognize that not all patrons appreciate spicy food, and therefore I shouldn't hold restaurants up to my high standards...  but if I did, it'd be a two star restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is ok. But the woman with the short hair is very very rude. I assume she is the owner. I asked to sit in the corner where it's more comfortable seating, and she answered with \"NO! no toilets\". What? I was just shaking my head and asked her if she wanted me to leave. How can you talk like that to your guests when they walk in the door? With a loud NO, no toilets. What the heck is that supposed to mean? 

Now I've been waiting for the check for 30+ minutes and they only have one other customer in here. Unbelievable. I am never going back again."}
{"text":"I have visited this restaurant in the past, before the renevation.  The service in MOST of the Asain restaurants I visit is cold and uninviting.  Maybe its a cultural thing, I dont know.  BUT I wlawys went anyways becase the food pretty good, and I knew a server there (charlie ) who also was a dealer...so he was always friednly.  

I visited there the other dat and sat at the front door for about 2 minutes. They need a hostess!!

More inportantly I place a togo order today.  2 tom Yum, Pad thai and eggrolls...Probably $40 of food.  The lady on the phone was short with me and rude and clearly could not understand me very well.  She proceeded to basically hang up before I finished my order.  YOU GUYS ARE DOWN THE STREET FROM MY OFFICE AND MY WIFES employer.  I wont be coming back due to your POOR customer service.  

I will be visiting your competitors at Krung Thai and the Kaizon.  I am from the restaurant industry for 15 years,,,I would strongly suggest better customer service skills or your renevations were ALL a waste of $$$"}
{"text":"What a great local restaurant for Thai and Vietnamese food. All of my dining experiences here have been great.

The inside of the restaurant is clean and nicely decorated with comfortable booths for seating. The employees always greet you as soon as you arrive and are very attentive. 

The menu offers a nice variety of options. They offer a large variety of appetizers, soups, traditional Thai dishes, curry entrees, salads, Vietnamese dishes, and even pho. I love the variety because that makes it easier to bring a group since everyone will find something they enjoy. The menu also has a section of entrees that are vegetarian. 

On my most recent visit we started with Spring Rolls and Summer Rolls. Both were very good and the ingredients tasted very fresh. For the three of us we shared Pad Thai and House Fried Rice. Both were generous portions with plenty of fresh vegetables, chicken, and shrimp in the dishes. The flavors of both dishes were excellent.

This would be my go to spot for Thai and Vietnamese if I still lived in this area. For now I'll just have to keep it on my list of must eat at restaurants for visits home."}
{"text":"I recently had dinner here with a group and really enjoyed the food and overall experience.

To try a variety of menu options I shared a few items with two others at the table. We started with the Potstickers and Chicken Satay. The potstickers were good, not too greasy. The chicken satay was good and the peanut sauce definitely made this dish. I could have eaten the peanut sauce on everything. 

Yellow Curry with combination of meats and Drunken Noodles with beef made for our main entrees. The curry was good, but probably not my favorite compared to curry I've had at other restaurants. The Drunken Noodles were great, I loved the beef and the flavor of the sauce on the noodles. 

The staff was gracious in letting our large group basically take over the restaurant. They were great at getting orders taken and out to us in an efficient manner. We had everything throughout the night that we needed."}
{"text":"We get this to-go pretty often.  Everything on the menu has been great.  The green curry and tom ka ghai are personal favorites.  Thai Spice is right up there with cravings cafe for best Thai food in Cleveland."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years! Seriously the best yellow curry around. Wonderful owners and incredible food."}
{"text":"Super busy at lunchtime during the week, so food takes a bit longer to come out and pretty quiet in the evenings/weekends.  A lot of good options and the price is really impressive for how good the food is.  In a strip mall which I am never really crazy about...Parking can be brutal, but it's worth it.  The middle aged and older Asian women severs are very polite plus usually on you to make sure everything is good.  Not always refilling water glasses as quickly so super hot entree orders may be something to reconsider.  Their 1-10 spice levels are consistent in my opinion.  7 seems to be just right.  Check it out."}
{"text":"I have been a frequent visitor of Thai Spice for many years. It's a small, cozy, cute place and the staff always knows me. Even when I call in to pick up for lunch, haha. Maybe because I always get the same thing? haha.  The staff is always very kind and courteous. 

My favorites are the Pad Kee Mao, Vegetarian Summer Rolls, Peach Bubble Tea, Chicken Pho and Bun Cha Gao but really, everything is DELICIOUS. We have never had a bad meal at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great consistency and quality of food 
Been in business a long long time for a reason"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai is back in my home town, however, I thoroughly enjoyed my chicken pad thai.  The salty sweetness was right on.  It is a simple staple of the ciusine but can easily turn wrong."}
{"text":"This is our go-to takeout place because of the proximity to our neighborhood, so I can't speak to the quality of recent service, because it's been ages since I have actually eaten on the premises. Food is generally very good. I'm a fan of their chicken coconut soup, which has a little heat. My husband usually goes for the duck choo chee or jade noodles. In warmer weather, I like the mango shrimp salad and a bubble tea (with pearls, of course). 

We have found recently that the takeout time is a bit on the slow side, so we've learned to plan for it. They could definitely be speedier."}
{"text":"This was my first trip there and I always get nervous ordering the shrimp rolls. But oh boy these ones were so fresh and yummy.  I tried the Jade Dragon Noodles with shrimp and shitaki mushrooms and sesame chicken which was excellent. Finnished off dinner with the crispy chocolate chip bananas. Found my new destination for Thai."}
{"text":"I came in a party of 5. They don't have all the food they show on the menu. They play only one song over and over and over. The cook forgot one of the orders. 45 minutes went by before the last person had their food... He didn't even get to eat it cause we had to go. They only had 2 bottles of water for our group when we asked for bottled water... The thum ka soup and my paper steak tasted good."}
{"text":"Thai and Vietnamese food are some of my favorite style of cuisine. This spot is great for an inexpensive tasty lunch, is clean, with pretty good service and easy parking. Very friendly and tasty food!"}
{"text":"With great spice, comes great responsibility. That's a key word here for Thai Spice, responsibility. When you pull up to the place, you'll see that it's pretty non-ornate from the facade. Is this an indication of how your food will be? No... not at all.

Get inside and be seated in this place that looks like a cross between a banquet hall and a diner. Simple, yet sophisticated. The menu is absolutely inviting and clear to read. If you check out their website, the menus are essentially scans of what you'll see in the restaurant. 

We went with the vegetarian summer rolls (super crispy and warm), the vegetable pad thai, and tofu pad thai. You can scour the rest of the reviews on how these dishes turn out. I was pretty satisfied with the portion size and flavoring of the tofu pad thai, it was on par with what I usually expect.

Responsibility is what earns the fourth star. The waitress was very informed and accommodating in service. I asked for no egg in my tofu pad thai and she took it a step further to inquire whether I wanted fish sauce or not. That kind of sense to ascertain a diner's dietary preference is great service. It's an attention to detail that is greatly appreciated.

The food is good, you'll find it comparable to the run-of-the-mill thai places. The spice of life this place will give you is a key attention to your, individual, dining experience."}
{"text":"We're regulars to this place because the service is fantastic, atmosphere is casual and the curry's are great.

If I had any complaint, it would be with the Beef Pho. The beef is always over cooked to my taste and the broth a little bland. 

I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Drunken noodles and Thai fried rice were delicious. Be warned the Thai fried rice with basil is spicy! The portions are very generous. Even the apps - the satay chicken even has large pieces on each skewer and they are plentiful. Service is polite and fast and ambienace is nice. We happened on Thai Spice searching for off strip options on our way out of LV. So glad we did!"}
{"text":"Disappointing. Had a late lunch here at around 3 and wish I had driven a little further to my regular spots. 

The pepper steak I ordered was just not very good. Meat seemed fairly low quality and the flavor or the sauce just wasn't very good. 

Decor and prices also not very good so there's absolutely no reason to go back."}
{"text":"Been going to this Thai restaurant since I was 7 years old. When it close due to a kitchen fire my family & I were devastated. When it open back up we were ecstatic! The service is great & the food is even better. The owner Kitty definitely knows what she is doing!"}
{"text":"Just had dinner there and the food was very good! I had pannang curry which was of the best I have ever had. Will come back again to try other dishes"}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD! And excellent, friendly service. I'm looking forward to working through their menu, especially after having the Pepper Steak. It was so tender and definitely the best I have had since leaving the Northeast over 30 years ago. Try it out for sure. I'm gonna order some take-out right now."}
{"text":"I would probably order takeout from them but not dine in ever again.. Almost 1 hour waiting for my food, and had like one waitress taking care of all the tables.. Food good but bad service."}
{"text":"Is Thai Spice a victim of its own success?  It seems like so much could go right here: but tonight, dinner took three hours, and while my Thai Jade Noodles were good, my husband's noodle bowl was just okay, and the curries our friends had seemed sweeter than necessary.  We ordered three appetizers, which was a mistake; the fried Siam rolls and gyoza were held in the kitchen until our Siam ribs were ready. The result?  They were cold and a little soggy.  Did I mention that dinner took three hours?  We had a nice time because the conversation at our table was good, but got no real explanation from the staff about the delays.

I want Thai Spice to be at the top of its game, the kind of restaurant I'm happy to drive out of my way to visit.  We've enjoyed previous visits here enough to recommend it to friends, but I'm not sure it's detour-worthy anymore with so many other better places to eat in Northeast Ohio."}
{"text":"Awesome Thai food but even awesomer Boba / Bubble tea!! Will be sure to go many more times."}
{"text":"SERVICE is EXCELLENT! Food is pretty dang good too! Lunch is my favorite. Great Value & fast!"}
{"text":"This place never fails! I've been coming back here whenever I visit my family. Friendly staff and the price is affordable! If you want a romantic night with your lovely date. Come here! It's peaceful, calm, and a good little getaway. This is the best thai food in town!"}
{"text":"Very good food. We waited for quite some time after being seated to give our drink orders. Then again to give food orders, however that was during the lunch rush so I assume they were just very busy. If you go for lunch they have great specials that come with soup first. There isn't alot of seating but it is worth a bit of a wait."}
{"text":"Totally a good place for a spicy meal (if you like it hot). Good atmosphere and servers a quick and polite. Definitely recommend it as a quiet ethnic  night out."}
{"text":"I order take out from here all the time.  Everything I've ordered is delicious!  Favorites include the Summer Rolls, Toong Tong, Pad Keemal, and Tofu Green Curry.  I can't speak for dining-in, but service is great every time I pick up an order, and it's always packed!"}
{"text":"Been a couple times. Basil chicken was a bit salty. Cashew chicken was good. Service was decent. Not bad but likely would prefer other spots in the area."}
{"text":"This was a pretty good Thai restaurant! I got the Pad Thai, the spicy string beans with chicken, and the tofu appetizer. The Pad Thai was good. Some of it was a bit over done, but all in all it was good. I wish there were more green beans in the spicy green bean dish (there was more chicken than green beans) but the sauce was good. I gotcha food to go, so I'm not sure what the waitstaff was like, but I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"This place is great!!!  Family owned,great service,freshly prepared food,fair prices. I have been eating here for awhile and very pleased to have found this restaurant. Must try their lunch specials,great prices,good size portions.FIVE STARS FOR SURE!!!"}
{"text":"I NEVER post reviews for food but I feel like I owe the world this very crucial and necessary review. If I could give this place -5 stars I would. Ok I'm being a little over dramatic it wasn't THAT bad if I take into account their good service and super comfy cushioned booths, but in terms of taste? ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE! I usually get the red curry at thai restaurants and I eat a lot of thai food as a vegan and it usually never disappoint BUT THIS SHIZZZ DISAPPOINTED ME ALRIGHT!! IT WAS SALTY AND OVERBEARING A TASTED LIKED DIRTY WATER UGH I WILL NEVER GO BACK WOUKD RATHER DIE OF HUNGER THAN EAT HERE AGAIN TBH"}
{"text":"Terrible service but great food. I wasn't a fan of their tom yum soup though, just wasn't spicy enough. Besides that, the pad thai and spring rolls were great. The plus side, they have a vegetarian menu! I went here with some friends and they all enjoyed their meals, especially the summer rolls. The Vietnamese dish was lacking but that was expected but I am happy to see that they are serving vietnamese crepes. Overall, pretty good but I hope the service gets much better."}
{"text":"Descent little spot. KInd staff, maybe short staffed on weekend however. Took a minute to get meal (wasn't even half a house yet). Since this is Thai and vietnamese...not bad. The thai tea was strong (cigarette like after taste). lbs of ice watered it down, that helped. Not milky as other places. Pad thai was missing something, a little strong on flavoring sauce. Spicey Thai basil with two chili pepper rating was least bit mild. barely tasted basil. Overall descent place to eat, but expect almost like thai food. Big Ting!!! for not having Jasmine rice."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery: Yellow curry was very good and rich. I also liked that it had potatoes in it!!"}
{"text":"WOW!  This is absolutely my FAVORITE Thai restaurant!  The atmosphere and ambiance as soon as you enter the dining room is relaxing and cozy.  Then there is the food.  Their Pad Thai is exquisite!  Also, BUBBLE TEA is AMAZING and they have several flavors to choose from!  Honeydew is one of my favorites. The dining room can get loud at times if there is a LARGE party but the servers usually value privacy and seat you away from others OR you can choose.  I like sitting in the center booths.  Spacious, comfortable and provides a little more privacy than a wide open table.  We will DEFINITELY be returning, whether it is takeout or dining in, we look forward to eating here again!"}
{"text":"I usually get the tofu pho and Thai tea or Vietnamese coffee. I've also had the shrimp spring rolls. All good! It is Americanized Thai food. It is close to work and there are not a ton of options in Westlake. The staff had always been pleasant."}
{"text":"Thai salad was good, smaller portion...brown rice was super dry and crusty.. Not often do I place a 2 star..."}
{"text":"Craving Thai food but as I walked in, it said Thai and Chinese, so this hybrid dining can be tricky to rate. The decor is interesting with clashing colors of light blue , orange, red, and peach. I was drawn in because the sign said \"voted best Thai since 1994 on the window. However It wasn't clear that it ended in 2006 which means 10 years of ? Lol

I ordered two appetizers and when I bit into them, it was cold in the center. Not what I was hoping for. I ordered 5 bottled waters for us and there was only 2 available. Really? 

I placed my order and as everyone's food was being served, the waiter then decides to tell me that my dish is not available; chicken with baby corn. I'm now begin to lose my appetite and get frustrated. 

My buddies are waiting for food to come and it takes a while. Why, the place is empty!!! They claim the food is ok, but I feel it taste like fast food low quality products. 

Overall, this place is nothing to brag about. I'm sure since 2006, the good ratings stopped, due to what I am experienced today! Foodies: just stay away"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times now and will usually do so before I feel I can give an accurate review.  I will also preface this by saying I love all different types of cuisine..... Thai, Indian, Italian, Mediterranean, Vietnamese... Etc. With all of that being said, this places serves some of best food I've ever eaten hands down!!! The Siam ribs and Thai basil duck being my favorite.  Perfect amount of spice and incredible flavor.... They will accommodate your preference when it comes to heat.... Be very careful about telling these folks you want your food spicy lol.  I love hot food, especially when the heat comes from something with flavor and purpose such as the chili peppers used by these folks.  I've also had the panang, red, and yellow curry as well as the mango chicken.... Needless to say these were also amazing!!  Service was not bad... And food took a little long to prepare, however when it comes to great food it usually takes a little while to cook because everything is fresh.  

Do yourself a favor and give this place a shot.  You will not be disappointed with the quality of the food.  One last time I will say this is one of the best places I've ever eaten!!"}
{"text":"We went there for lunch. It was a very comfortable place to dine in. Waitresses were very friendly. Food was great for its price. Will come back again next time we go to Westlake."}
{"text":"I had visited Thai Spice once, about 4 years ago, and really enjoyed the food.
For whatever reason, we hadn't been back until Saturday afternoon.  

Thai Spice is a large restaurant, that is open, and very clean.  

Service is very polite, and very quick. 

We ordered:
Pork Egg rolls
Shrimp and Chicken Pad Thai
Thai Spice Beef.  

The pork egg rolls were very good.  They were not greasy.  They were crisp, and flavorful, and the deep fried egg roll wrapper had almost a tempura flavor: very light and delicious.  The duck sauce that was served with them was good as well. 

Shrimp and Chicken Pad Thai:
I always have to order Pad Thai at a new spot...its usually a really good way to judge the rest of the dishes.  This was almost perfect.  Flavorful, just the right amount of spice, and the noodles were cooked perfectly.   The only issue?  Only 2 shrimp.  When I order something called \"shrimp and chicken\" I want there to be more than 2 pieces of shrimp.  Since my husband and I split the entrees, we each only got one.  

Thai Spice Beef: Lean strips of beef marinated in royal thai sauce, sauteed and served on top of rice crispy noodles...this is Thai Spice's signature dish, and it is DELICIOUS.  The meat is tender.  The rice noodles are crisp, and crunchy, giving a pleasant texture, and the sauce...YUM.  That's about all I can say without drooling.  

The Thai Iced Coffees are good too, and a large \"to go\" coffee is enormous.  

Thai Spice, well done.  I can't wait to come out again, to try more items!!!"}
{"text":"I really want to give this place a better score and I think I would have if we would have ordered food to go. The reason why I gave it a lower score is because of the service and the atmosphere inside. 

Yes, it's nice they have tables to dine at however some of the booths are old a squeaky. Also, the decor inside just looks dated. If they place got a whole face lift, it would be better. The service was slow. Like we were seated at the table for 5 min before we ordered water. And then it took the server another good 3-4 min to get us our waters. She just didn't seem very attentive, maybe she was new. 

Now on to the food. Delicious! I love Vietnamese chicken salad bowls, I could probably eat that every single day and never get sick of it. My guys food was really delicious as well. I believe he ordered the Jade bowl. 

I would definitely order takeout from here however, I don't know if I would ever dine in again."}
{"text":"Out of town traveler hoping for a quality meal:  Pad Thai with lots of Chicken and Shrimp and sprouts and very good taste combined with a healthy seaweed salad and I chalk this up as an easy Win for road warrior healthy eating while also being fun and tasty; the owner was very friendly as well and great customer service."}
{"text":"One of my favs. The lunch specials are great and very affordable. Dinner is also very nice. I'd say 4.5 stars. Only because my last beef salad was way below your standards. Hopefully next time I go you'll be back on track."}
{"text":"This place is legit!  Everything was on point if not better.  I had the egg rolls, Tom Kha Soup and Spicy Pad Thai.  This ends a 5 year search for the best Thai in Houston for sure."}
{"text":"Thai Spice was highly recommended to me by a work collegue. However, I was disappointed with their cuisine, ambiance and service. I actually tried it out twice, just to make sure that my first experience was indicative of how this place truly was...

The meat is either overcooked or undercooked in this place. The service is rather invasive and not very quick. It is your run of the mill place with below average food and very limited ethnic decor. The place has a medicinal feel to it. 

I would not recommend this place. There are truly superior Thai places in Vegas to waste your money on this one; I reviewed a couple of them already. Everything is a bit pricey here, especially for what you get. There is nothing good about this place, and overall, it is slighly below average."}
{"text":"Fan F***ing-tastic. We loveeeeee Thai Spice! They literally have the most delicious Pad Thai in the area. So much flavor, so fresh, so tasty! I can't say enough great things about this place. They have the most unusually delicious wonton soup. It has lots of veggies [cabbage or something like that] in it, and lots of flavor. They also have this coconut milk soup that is amazing. Just so damn good. 

Everything we've had here has been out of the park. Dine in or takeout, great food for the price. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Very clean place surprisingly for a strip mall Thai restaurant. We placed an order for pad Thai and coconut shrimp, deciding to split everything as we weren't to hungry. The lady brought out some coconut soup, which we didn't order... I asked why and was told it was part of the pad Thai meal. It wasn't very good anyways.... Pad Thai was what you would expect, big portion plenty to split for two and good. After some time we asked for our shrimp... The waitress seemed as though we didn't ask for it, she placed the order and brought it out a few minutes later. It wasn't that good, over fried for sure. If you do order it get some sweet chili sauce; the ginger dipping sauce that it comes with is gross (sorry for being harsh). Go to pay our ticket and what do you know. They charged us 3.50 for the soup we didn't ask for.  So instead of brining us coconut shrimp to begin with she brought the coconut soup. Not sure where the confusion was as we never made mention and we even asked about it when it came to our table. After a few minutes trying to explain we happily paid the entire bill just to escape."}
{"text":"I just had their pho. It's good. I prefer my chicken more shredded though. It's served as slices."}
{"text":"This place is decent. My only real complaint is the fact that they are not kid friendly at all. The food was alright. I've been there a couple of times and have had the fried rice and the larb and some soup. Eh... probably wont be back"}
{"text":"After a super-fun energetic night at a New Years Eve party, and a long New Year's Day touring Las Vegas hotspots, my wife and I finished our mini-vacation with dinner at Thai Spice. We got there when it was rather quiet and mostly empty. The music and environment was calm and soothing. Our super-young waitress \"Willow\" welcomed us with a smile and perfect English, and gave us dinner suggestions. She was really helpful and friendly, and also CUTE as a button.

We had the Beef Curry and the Drunken Noodles, which were both DELICIOUS. Now, my beef curry was supposedly at spicy level 7, which was almost too hot for me. But that was my mistake, because back in Philly I once had a place serve me food at spicy level 5, and it tasted like they put nothing at all in it. Anyway... our meal was AMAZING, the meats were tender and juicy, and by my request Willow even brought me an extra small bowl of rice (at no extra charge, I found out later much to my surprise). The bill itself was very reasonably priced... $11 for each entree, and like $2 for each fresh baby coconut. We got about half our food to-go (and I am glad we did).

I wish we'd taken more pictures of the food. Our experience reminded me that I always have a good time when I visit restaurants in Las Vegas.

We left a FAT TIP, because... damn good food, damn good service, nice soothing environment in this family-run restaurant."}
{"text":"I like seeing how a restaurant does with its food when it comes to takeout dishes. With Uber eats you can practically get anything nowadays. I really enjoyed the chicken and dumplings. The sauce that it came with had a soy flavor and was kind of spicy. This was my first experience with the Panang curry. I liked the flavor of the sauce but some of the vegetables they used I could have went without. The mushrooms were a little slimy although cute. The red peppers were overly sweet for the semi spicy dish. Also the slices of stringy lime leaves tasted of a mix between Pine-Sol and a lemony fresh cleaner. It's stated that the dish was a medium level spice. I believe medium to be spicier than mild? In my opinion this dish was not really spicy. It did come with jasmine rice which was cooked to perfection. Although there was a few things about this specific dish that I didn't like I can imagine that Based off of the quality of the ingredients I would enjoy the other curry dishes that they have and I am willing to try again. I am still giving them four stars."}
{"text":"Come back at Thai Spice again after work. Today I get Priking Chicken and Curry Panang Beef. They both so good especially spicy no. 3 perfect for me . Also Thai Tea in big cocktail glass look funny but I like their idea. I will be back again sure"}
{"text":"Love this place, good prices, good service and the food is awesome! Now let us dance......with swords!"}
{"text":"Yuck. I didn't like anything about it. Service was incredibly slow. We went for lunch, and it took at least 20 minutes for our food to come. I ordered Beef Panang. It was really overcooked. The beef tasted like mushy baby food. Plus, I ordered #6 on spicy level and it was not at all spicy. My husband ordered pork eggrolls.  I couldn't figure out how half was hot and half ice cold. His fried rice had pork that was good, beef tasted old and weird. He picked out the beef. His food also came a very long time before mine did and I was starving. And 2 lunches were $40 with the tip. Panang $13, fried rice $13, iced tea, and eggrolls $?. Final opinion, I wouldn't eat here again if it was free. Disgusting. I wish they had a negative star for the worst place you have ever been."}
{"text":"We knew that this might not be a fiery explosion of authentic Thai when we spotted a massive doddering of geriatrics bumbling out the door onto the sidewalk in front.  Alas, our fears were realized when we discovered that Thai Spice offers tasty, but really Americanized Thai food.

My panang curry tasted nice, but it was not spicy.   It contained a good amount of chicken, but a paltry amount of veggies.   Mon cher chou ordered the green beans and chicken.  His sauce was essentially the same with the addition of cashews.  There were more veggies in that-- nicely crisp-tender green beans and green pea pods.    The peanut sauce was a bit too sweet and thick.  It all tasted fine, but it was not the authentic stuff that you can get at places like Thai Hut or Thai Kitchen.  It was definitely blanded down for American tastes.

The stand out here was the summer roll appetizer.  Thai Spice nailed it!  They got it just right-- slightly more vermicelli than greens, a few basil leaves,  a few plump, juicy shrimp and a tender, freshly prepared wrapper.  Perfect.  The sauce was really good, but less spicy than I would have liked it.  The jasmine rice was also well done-- nicely steamed and fragrant.

The atmosphere is very, very clean and neat-- pretty, too.  The service is friendly and polite.

After trying the summer roll, I have the feeling that Thai Spice could kick it up a notch if it wanted to.  I want them to!"}
{"text":"After a week of eating casino buffet food, this place was a welcomed change. The decor is nice and in sync with the Vegas neon theme. The food was very good and the service was great. Glad I found it."}
{"text":"Really good food and great service I will come back again. I had the chicken and shrimp phat Thai 4 spicy level and it was perfect."}
{"text":"I love this place so much!!! My boyfriend and I go about twice sometimes 3 times a week for lunch. Their lunch specials are great! $7.25 gets you a cup of soup, salad, rice, eggroll, and your choice of a main item. I'm addicted to the chicken chow mein!! Staff is very friendly and food comes out fast!"}
{"text":"My favorite authentic Thai restaurant so far in Northeast Ohio.  Best Pad Thai ever. Service can be a little slow only because they have 2 or 3 servers at any given time. Those women work it though and deserve your generous tip.  Great for dining and take out."}
{"text":"Have gotten the pork fried rice, crab Rangoon, and egg rolls. They were all not bad. Nothing really to write home about either. For a restaurant that boasts being the best Chinese restaurant in Vegas, I expected a little better. The food was fine though and the people were friendly so I'll be back"}
{"text":"Decent place for a quiet meal on the road. Their bubble tea was really good, lots of flavors."}
{"text":"Delicious traditional Thai food at a reasonable price. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Thai Spice has been a favorite of mine since 1994 when we moved to Vegas. The owner was so sweet and loved my baby girl. Throughout the years we frequented the rest. for dinner and she always brought my daughter a small bowl of rice to keep her busy while we waited for food. Just fantastic customer service and kindness.
 As for the food...i love it! The chan ram is my go to appitizer as well as chicken satay. Tom kha kai soup is so good. the duck curry is delicious and good old sweet and sour chicken is the best in town. Thai tea is yummy too!
I still enjoy driving across town to have a fantastic meal, I know what im getting and I know there will be no rude wait staff. Thai Spice Is still the best in las vegas in my opinion.
Enjoy"}
{"text":"Food is great. Best to do carry out. We had a horribly rude waitress Sunday. Slow, mean, inattentive, seemed annoyed and mad the whole time. I've always loved the food here but hesitant Togo back due to the bad service we received."}
{"text":"Getting better, Thai Spice. Sweet Basil kitchen was closed at 9 pm(seriously considering a star deduction). That afforded us the chance to try this place again. Tofu pad thai was on point. Crispy tofu triangles, not mush, in a heaping helping of noodles. Spring rolls were excellent and tasted like pork. Don't tell the wife, she didn't notice. Tempura vegetable app was alright but not stupendous. I had the green apple bubble tea, she the strawberry. WAY better in slushie form. Oh well, live and learn. The host was very nice and got our to-go  order together in under twenty minutes. 

And open until 9:30."}
{"text":"The food was very delicious! My father is acquainted with the owner and he wanted my family and I to try it out. 

We ordered chicken satay, stuffed fried chicken, a seafood dish, and spicy catfish. 

Chicken satay, stuffed fried chicken, and the seafood dish was really good. I give that 5/5. The spicy catfish 3/5, for the price of it, it honestly could of been better. It was just fried catfish with some bell peppers and onions. It was $18. I felt like the price could of been cheaper. 

Overall , it was a good experience my family and I had. The customer service was really nice and helpful. The restaurant was really quiet as well. I will definitely come again"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, great service and the best Penang curry in years. Soups and spring rolls also tasty ."}
{"text":"The best Thai I've had in a long awhile. Dishes are consistently good, not overly saucy like some places. The price is fair,  Lunch specials are very reasonable. Never dined in as of yet, but the food is excellent either way I'm sure."}
{"text":"Great little find! Authentic Thai food Served quickly and with friendly and attentive service. Had the pad tai and it was delicious."}
{"text":"We came here with the kids and got the family style hot pot of Tom Kai.  Amazing food and really nice people.  The duck is  so tender."}
{"text":"It's a ok place. Fast service and friendly staff. Food is ok not as great as what I have read on the reviews. Not sure if I'm gonna go back there again. Maybe I'll try some other Thai food"}
{"text":"Dinner night with my friend and also treating him for his birthday. 

Been a few years since I have dined here so decided to stop by. Since I was on the west side of the strip today anything is possible!!!!!

Anyone want to step back in time? Cool, cause the decor is the same as it was in 1994 when they opened. A definite locals favorite and a 16 time 'Best of Las Vegas' Yes its that good, but dont expect anything fancy, but do expect exceptional food.

Our waiter was super funny, I think his name was Nicky. He tried to get me to 'Not' order the hottest curry on the menu because he didn't think I could handle it! LOL I had to prove him wrong. I think he reluctantly put the order in and seriously wanted to witness me while I ate the hottest panang duck the chef could muster up! He got proven wrong because I even asked for more sauce to take home!! NOTE: I can eat habenero peppers raw and on occasion a ghost pepper. So, hot to me is sometimes not hot enough...

My friend had the pork egg rolls(I ate one and they were awesome) and  egg fried rice. He really enjoyed it and also took his food home.

Portions are super generous. Prices a little high but worth the quality of preparation and presentation. The chef gets a high five and 5 STARS!

A local's favorite, close to the strip, and easy to find. Highly Recommend!"}
{"text":"Was there last weekend with my big family( yes family of 12). And the service and food was spot on.. I would say best Thai food around.. And service was quick too. Love it and would be my go to place for Thai now onwards..."}
{"text":"The Panang Curry was excellent and the Toong Tong appetizer was wonderfully unexpected! Delicious."}
{"text":"Had lunch here yesterday.  With more than half the dining room full and only 2 servers they were very overwhelmed.  Getting seated took extra time as was checking out.  Other than slow service the food was pretty good.

I ordered the beef pho for lunch.  It came in a nice big bowl with chopsticks, spoon, sprouts, basil, cilantro, jalapeño, and a lime slice.  It was pretty standard pho and I couldn't help thinking as I was eating it that the broth was missing something.  I just couldn't put my finger on it.  But it was.  I really enjoyed it.  Just couldn't figure out what it was missing.

Experience overall was slow and the meal was good."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is like any other Thai/ Asian restaurant just more on the fancy side. The menu is pretty big offering tons of great choices. Prices are a bit higher than your normal asian restaurant but it's worth it, food is great, well portioned and presented very well. The green tea is very well made, a lot of flavor but natural not sugary. The duck that I ordered was done perfectly and very high quality food."}
{"text":"Really, really yummy thai iced tea. And the portion is huge-which is abnormal! Can't say I'm complaining though!

I also had the pho, which was alright, but not the best I've ever had. I enjoyed the broth but I asked for rare beef and it was well done (not to mention, tough). It was really busy so that's probably why that happened, but that doesn't make it okay. 

I also tried the chicken coconut soup since everyone on Yelp raves about it but I thought it was terrible. The menu says that it's tom kha and I can promise you--it is NOT. I am a tom kha fanatic, and this soup was totally wrong. The chicken was seriously low quality, it was way too sour and the coconut solids had broken. Just in case you're curious, it's really hard to break coconut milk--which probably means it had been made a long time ago.

If I hadn't had that terrible soup I would have given this place four stars, but I have to question any Thai restaurant that would have served me that soup."}
{"text":"I love this place. I get takeout Pho on a regular basis and have had dinner in the dining room a few times too. Very nice people and excellent Thai food!"}
{"text":"We tried this place because it's close to our work and we were looking for a better Thai place. The Pad Thai was one of the best I've had and the Green Curry was great too. The spice level was 5 and it wasn't too spicy. I only give 4 starts because the service lacked. Slow to even come to our table, they didn't stop by to check in to often and it even took a long time to bring the check. I will go back for the food however until I find a better place around my work."}
{"text":"Nice staff..had the thai string bean with chicken and lemon grass soup. Very good!"}
{"text":"Love there tom yum soup its like no other the service is great and adorable prices. Award winning thai spice"}
{"text":"I mean... it's ok. The inside is better than some of our local Thai Establishments (not *nearly* as nice as Banana Blossom though). It kind of has a chain restaurant feel though. The food was mediocre.... not a lot of flavor. 

However - the bubble tea and thai iced tea were super delish."}
{"text":"Saw the GRAND OPENING banner and signage while driving to a Yelp event, and decided to grab a quick dinner before heading home.  The restaurant has been opened for years, but due to a kitchen fire, they were closed for 7 months.  So no FTR for this spacious restaurant filled with traditional Thai art and carvings.  Even though the name suggests that it is a Thai restaurant, they also have a significant number of Chinese items on the menu.

The menu is pretty straightforward.  except it is arranged a little differently from other Thai restaurants (i.e., no curry section). Aside from the usual Appetizers, Salads, Soups sections, the rest of the menu is broken down into sections by proteins (e.g., Poultry, Beef or Pork, Seafood,Vegetables, except you have choice of chicken, beef, pork, seafood or shrimps on just about all of the entree items.

Since I like to order what the restaurant considers their signature dish on my first visit, I was recommended to try Mint Leaf Beef, which is beef marinated in Thai sauce and then cooked with chili and fresh mint leaves.  It was prepared and served quickly,and the flavor was very good.  The medium spicy level is probably less spicy compared to some other restaurant, so if you you prefer more heat you are going to have to specify Thai heat level and not the tamed American heat level.

Ambiance:  3.5/5  Thai themed decor in a spaciously arranged dining room.

Service: 4/5  Maybe it was good because they are not that busy, but I have no complaints about their service level.

Food:  4/5  I enjoyed what I ordered, and look forward to trying more items in the future.

Price:  5/5  Lunch specials are $7.25 which is good.  
           4/5  Dinner prices is average compared with other Thai restaurants.

Location:  SW, near the Palms.

Parking:  5/5  Plenty of parking spaces in this strip mall.

Overall, 4 stars!"}
{"text":"Many Happinesses!!!

Great Thai food, wonderful people, and a really good price, and BYOB.... yep, this is the kind of small business that SHOULD be rated well on Yelp and Urbanspoon.  Stop reading reviews and check it out.

Reminder, it's BYOB!  They have some beer (2 I think), but no wine. Be smart and just bring your own party.

In fact, I think I am going to go here right now."}
{"text":"This place is a Very good, affordable thai food right next to the Palms. When they say something is spicy they are not kidding. Everything we had was very good, intense flavor. Nice change of pace to the flood of higher end places all over Vegas"}
{"text":"After work stopped in because I've smell the delicious smells of this place for like a year.  It was 4:30 and place empty.  Nice lady behind counter said it gets busy later.  Ordered to go: pad Thai, cashew chicken, & shrimp wonton.  The wontons not too crispy, very full inside, but a little greasy.  The pad Thai was sooooo good but spicy hot so if you don't like spicy say NO!!  They don't use tofu in it which was good :).  The cashew chicken was good, no goopy sauce!  Yah!!  They would have gotten higher stars but I ordered 2 white rice and there was zero rice in the bag.  My drive home was 25 min so I wasn't going back.  I did try calling and the woman made it like she didn't remember me ordering or there!!! Make sure you check your bags before you leave!!"}
{"text":"Okay first time here. We had about eleven guest, all hungry for some good old thai food. And they manage to serve us quick and delicious. They manage to dish out at least 7-8 dishes really fast. Everybody was satisfied. Next time, when visiting vegas this is a place to go to for good old thai food."}
{"text":"Best Pad Thai around! First time trying Pho and I won't go to another place! The atmosphere is so welcoming and even though there isn't a picture, best crab Rangoon's I have ever had, and I've had a lot!"}
{"text":"My mom and I were craving Thai in a very bad way.  We didn't want to go over to the east side because we didn't want to deal with all of the new construction so we decided to check out Thai Spice.  We are so glad that we did.  Great Thai food is no longer exclusive to the other side of town.  I had the chicken coconut soup and the chicken red curry. The soup was piping hot and delicious.  The red curry was as good as any I've had.  My mom went with pad Thai and was pleasantly surprised by the flavor.  Our craving for Thai was happily satisfied.  We will definitely go back and probably soon."}
{"text":"This is my friend's favorite Thai place and with good reason. I've had their tom yum soup twice and it's really good.  Perfectly spiced and a good proportion of shrimp and mushrooms. 

I generally don't like pad thai but love theirs: not too sweet, noodles had a good consistency and they give you mounds of it. 

I like that they give you a scale of 1-10 for spiciness. It takes the guess work out of \"mild,\" \"Medium\" and \"spicy.\""}
