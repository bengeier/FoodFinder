{"text":"Really liked this place! Came here when I was on vacation for lunch. Ordered the cashew chicken. Very flavorful and filling. Service was really good. The people there are great! Will have to go again when I visit."}
{"text":"Excellent Chinese food. Real Chinese. (Get the Chinese Menu) Bitter melon soup is sooo good and just feel free to explore. You can bring your friend who is not adventurous as well, they have good Americana Chinese. Definite hole in the wall, however like so many good food AND good service."}
{"text":"Ever since they left their old location on 19th and Dunlap I been looking for a place to go for Chinese Food. Now thanks heaven there back. The food tasted just like the old days, including the Crystal Shrimp."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a while.  Not to far from my house.

If you are looking for ambiance don't come, place is supper clean, but very bland.

Ordered take out from counter, received food in about 10 mins.

We had egg drop soup, egg rolls, house chow mein and Kung Pao chicken.

Everything was good. I thought egg rolls were very good.

If you want no thrills good Chinese food.  It is a solid place to go."}
{"text":"Good place. Someone here on Yelp recommended the sui gow soup (lookin' at you, Sylvia L.), of which I'd never heard, and both milady wife and I found it delicious. That brings up another point - that soup doesn't appear on the standard menu. Apparently they have a Chinese menu hidden away somewhere, which isn't usually offered to us haole customers. I'll ask for it next time.

Good Singapore rice noodles, good dry beef chow fun. I didn't think much of the tangerine peel beef. I'm always looking for above-average Asian resto's in my neighborhood, and this seems to be one of the better ones. Good and attentive service - the server seemed to recognize us, which, given that we're not in frequently, surprised me. 

I wish that they were open for dinner - daily closure at 5PM seems a little eccentric for a restaurant, but I suppose that they know their own business best. 

The neighborhood seems to be getting a little sketchy - the influence of the nearby light rail, coupled with proximity to the canal? There's an abandoned business, as of this writing, next door to the Silver Dragon that seems to be becoming a gathering point for homeless folks."}
{"text":"We keep coming back! The food has never disappointed us! I'm a Yu Fu with Eggplant fan,
husband loves Crystal Shrimp, Beef Chow Fun is great, as are Scallops with XO sauce. We haven't had a disappointing entrée yet. The service is prompt, staff is friendly, and we always enjoy our visits."}
{"text":"It may not look like much on the outside, but this humble restaurant offers some of the most authentic Cantonese cuisine in the Valley. The shuijiao (??), rich with pork and shrimp, are extremely generous and go well in a very generous bowl of broth and egg noodles. The half deep fried chicken (???) is delicious but it is a small portion; go for the bigger one to feed the family. We'll be back to try out the rest of the Cantonese menu."}
{"text":"Arrived at 5:50. Got menus at 6:15. Got drinks at 6:30  left at 7:00. Never had a chance to order. They were \" busy \"  sad excuse for what once was a good place.  Food might be good if you can get someone, anyone to take your order. Really disappointed"}
{"text":"The absolute BEST Chinese food in Arizona.  It is authentic, fresh, always served hot and one of the few resturaunts that is ALWAYS consistent.
The place lacks ambiance, but let's face it, it's difficult to find this kind of food in a resturaunt that has what a 5 star steakhouse has as far as design and ambiance goes but......who really cares about that when the food is as exceptional as it is at Silver Dragon. This place reopened after being closed for about 5 years in a new location and I have to say I wasn't quite sure what to expect the first time we went back as I didnt think they could be any better than what they use to be...but they nailed it big time. Try the Hong Kong menu and get the beef and eggplant hotpot....you will not be sorry!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Chinese food spots in Phoenix. The sweet and spicy chicken was excellent. If you like hot mustard make sure to get the stuff the mix in house and not the packets."}
{"text":"Their food is absolutely amazing.  Everything I've tried so good: Hot and sour soup, Crystal shrimp. kung Paou shrimp, Beef with back bean sauce, orange chicken, Crab puffs, Hot jasmine tea.  When I go back, I will be trying more."}
{"text":"The place is a hot mess. Would it kill them to have even the most rudimentary customer service structure in place? I feel I can roll with the punches and put up with stuff, and I want to be politically correct and sensitive here as well, but this was too much. Confusion at the front door amongst several customers, confusion being seated in correct waiting order, long wait to even get a menu, confusion making sure I had the \"secret Chinese menu,\" longer wait for first soup courses with delivery to companion diner 15 minutes apart (!), entree deliveries equally disparate. I was in my booth 60 minutes before I got my soup. I was seated in the restaurant a total of two hours to complete an experience where we didn't linger. Yes, my food was tasty: some kind of duck soup (when delivered I asked if Groucho was in the kitchen. Hey! My companion diner laughed), and a plate of shrimp with Chinese vegetables. But by now, who cares? The place was full, but not over run, with empty tables piling up as we sat waiting. I'm aware that a recent outstanding professional review may have amped up the demand, but  even this can't excuse what was close to the worst service experience of my life, right down to having to ask for a cup to drink the tea. We stayed cheerful, and I still left a pity party 20% tip. But I won't return. I don't care how much Seftel raved about the joint."}
{"text":"I am so happy that the Silver Dragon has reopened. They were fantastic at their old location, but I love the new place even more. You can order from the regular menu or be a little adventurous and ask for the Chinese menu. Everything is delicious, the new location is beautiful inside, and the service is attentive and helpful."}
{"text":"I was craving fried rice and soup. I remembered seeing this place and decided to stop in.  I ordered the Walnut shrimp and war wonton soup.  Of course I had enough for three meals and did take most of it home.  Delicious.   I can't wait to eat there again."}
{"text":"Huge rock in my mushu pork. Nearly broke my tooth. Food was below average. China Chili far exceeds. Do not eat here. I will not return"}
{"text":"Found hair in my egg drop soup(disgusting) so I will no longer get anything there no way !!!!"}
{"text":"Silver Dragon is what it is - a Chinese restaurant with nary a Chinese patron in sight. Pretty much caters to the lunch crowd made up of those who are \"lucky\" enough to work in the general vicinity (sadly raises hand). Can get very crowded at lunchtime but there's fast turnover because it's a fairly large space so the wait's never too long.

Standard lunch special dishes - your kung paos, your mongolian beefs, your sweet & sours, yada yada yada. Comes with rice, egg roll, soup for $5.50-$6.50. Decent, tasty standard Chinese food which is bound to have you nodding off at your computer within an hour and miss that important 2 pm \"all-hands\" conference call. 

All in all, you've been there, done that. But if you're around these parts (why?), then why not do it again?"}
{"text":"I'm surprised there aren't that many reviews on this place. It looks like it used to be a fast food joint, and is lacking in decor and atmosphere, but you will see quite a few Asian people dining here, which is always a good sign if you want authentic Hong Kong food. Important to know there are two menus - the Americanized Chinese menu, and the Chinese Chinese menu. We've never ordered from the American Chinese menu - if you want authentic flavors, ask for the Chinese menu, which does have English descriptions. I'm vegetarian, so I can't speak for most of the food (which I heard from my dining companions were excellent), but even non-vegetarians enjoyed the Buddhist Style rolls, which are vegetable-stuffed rolls made from tofu skin and fried. So delicious. We will come back, even though it's a bit of a drive for us!"}
{"text":"When I was told to visit Silver Dragon because it was traditional Hong Kong Style Chinese food I was excited because there is a lack of authentic Chinese food in Phoenix.  The minute we walked in and majority of the patrons were speaking Cantonese, I knew it would be good!  Then when the wait staff presented me with an Asian menu in addition to the regular menu, I knew that I would find traditional authentic dishes I grew up eating.  I found the servings of Crispy chicken and salty duck to be quite substantial, as was the salted fish and chicken fried rice.  The gai lan (Chinese broccoli) was tender and seasoned perfectly Sayers in garlic.  The staff was prompt and friendly.  Many of the authentic dishes incorporate dried scallops which is rare to find because dried scallops are very expensive!  I found my regular Chinese restaurant!"}
{"text":"A favorite authentic Hong Kong style restaurant among the chinese community in Phoenix. This is a go to place for my family dinners, well more lunch now (you'll see why later)

Pros:
- delicious and affordable food - item that stands out is the sui gow (a wonton skin wrapped around a generous piece of shrimp and ground pork) egg noodle soup. Probably the one and only place in Arizona that makes this and is delicious. I've only had their authentic Hong Kong style dishes and most of them are good. For example, the Singapore style rice noodles, dry beef chow fun, and smooth egg beef chow fun are also amazing. 

- nice and friendly servers

Cons:
- parking lot is small
- restaurant closes at 5 PM, a recent changed that they made
- many flies flying around the restuarant the last few times I've visited. Had a difficult time eating since i was so busy shooing the flies away from my food.

Would have given less stars if it wasn't for the sui gow noodle soup. Can't find this anywhere else in Arizona."}
{"text":"Best Chinese restaurant of all time. Everywhere else sucks in comparison. Shrimp and lobster sauce 10 outta 10. Salty shrimp 10 outta 10. Eggplant with garlic sauce 10 outta 10, and for god sakes the pan fried noodles( boner alert). Support this place!!"}
{"text":"This small unpretentious restaurant arguably serves the BEST Cantonese/Hong Kong style food in the valley.  There are two menus - one that caters to the American palate and the other that is favored by local Chinese or Cantonese patrons.  Both menus offer tasty entrees that will satisfy the most critical foodie.  Their seafood wintermelon soup is to die for.  I will drive 45 minutes one way just to savor this soup.  If you're looking for \"authentic Hong Kong style\" cuisine, you'll be hard pressed to find a better one in the valley.  Please note that the restaurant closes at 5 PM daily.  They are open six days a week and closed on Wednesdays."}
{"text":"This was by far the best Chinese I've had in Arizona thus far I had the classic sweet and sour chicken pork fried rice crab puff and fried shrimp everything was absolutely delicious and the prices were great my only complaint would be they only sold cans of soda no fountain drinks and for a can of soda they wanted 1.25! We opted for free hot tea and water overall I'm very pleased and will definitely be back for more of this awesome food!"}
{"text":"We went to have late lunch at Silver Dragon yesterday. What a disappointment! Since we were traveling the entire summer and most of the fall, we were looked so much forward to some great Chinese food. Our favorite dish French style filet mignon was very dry with very few mushrooms and onions. What happend to that great mouthwatering sauce with kick of pepper and sweetness of honey! Just gone! We also order curried Singapore-style rice noodles. Guess what! The noodles were not rice noodles at all. It was hard flour noodle! What had gone so wrong here? Where is Mr. Kam Yun? I think he should go back to retirement unless he goes back to cooking some wonderful food served there like he did in August of 2014 when he reopened the restaurant. One star is for Buddhist Vegetables dish which was just ok, most definitly not what we had many times before."}
{"text":"I was really impressed with Silver Dragon! Their Egg Drop soup was very good, the beef dish I ate was so good I didn't want to stop eating it! Service was a bit slow, but manageable, you could tell they were a bit overwhelmed or maybe someone called off that night.

Anyone, what sealed the deal on this place is when my buddy (who lived in Hong Kong) came in with his mother to eat. If it has his blessing then I know its the real deal!

Check these folks out!!"}
{"text":"This place actually isn't closed, it is changing ownership.  It will reopen as The New Silver Dragon soon."}
{"text":"I grew up going to this place when they were located at 19th and Dunlap.  SO HAPPY to find out that they opened up again!  Sweet & Hot Shrimp was great.  Super speedy service for take out."}
{"text":"Silver Dragon was recommended by my daughter's doctor, who is Chinese. We couldn't wait to try it! Bad idea! It was the worst \"Chinese\" food we've ever had! We've had better-looking and -tasting food from the grocery freezer. Don't waste your time or hard-earned money. We won't go back! Silver Dragon deserves No STARS. Yelp makes me give 1."}
{"text":"*****THIS RESTAURANT IS NOW CLOSED***** (We were there on closing night, by chance, and heard it from the owners' daughter's mouth- it was time for them to retire). 

It's hard to choose between Silver Dragon and Gourmet House of Hong Kong. Hubby and I live mere blocks from GHoHK, and have had many excellent meals there. We'd read some reviews of SD in New Times, and decided to give it a try. Unlike the previous reviewer's experience, the place was full of Asians at dinner time. The \"regular\" menu had all the Americanized standards, but GHoHK had already trained us to be more adventurous with the second menu, written mostly in Chinese. Hubby and I agreed that the soups and the mixed appetizer plates are better at GHoHK, but that our entrees had better flavor at SD (although GHoHK's are prettier). Hubby had a mixed meat Singapore flat noodle with a curry sauce that, when we heated up the left-overs for dinner tonight, said was even better the second time. I had the beef chow fun, dry sauteed. Delicious. Both places are decor-dives, but clean, with fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"Five stars for the authentic Chinese food! The chef knows how to cook and makes the food right. This is one of my favorite Chinese restaurant. I don't have to drive so far to the East Valley for good Chinese comfort food. My favorite is the brisket beef hot pot. When the wait staff serves it on the table it sizzles and you can smell the anise, cinnamon aroma from the sauce. When I bite into the beef it melts in my mouth. Just by the meal itself and of course rice is filling. There are also dishes that are unique such as beef and bitter melon chow fun. I liked the taste of bitter melon because I grew up eating it. This is a restaurant to try something new and get out of the same old taste of American Chinese food. Be bold and expand you're taste buds! 

The restaurant is only open for certain times and days. Make sure to call first. The waitstaff are friendly and they also have an American Chinese menu available."}
{"text":"home cooking.  they have great wanton . We had their  fried chicken which was moist  and with a lot of flavor . We had their black bean ribs with Chinese brochill. This was one on my favorites.  Food is always consistent.  Had to have their  crystal  shrimp.  They were busy and took a little  time for the food to come out"}
{"text":"They make good Asian vegetable with garlic sauce here. Goes well over rice. Probably my favorite Chinese restaurant in the area. Low key and grungy. Just the way any good Chinese food place should be."}
{"text":"The multiple updates I made for A.C.E. in Mesa shows how much I love authentic Hong Kong style cuisine. While I crave that cuisine very often, the distance has deterred me from traveling there as often as I'd like. But then I found this place that serves the same kind of cuisine at pretty much similar prices ... and it's a lot nearer to me. Very friendly service, convenient location, great food  in generous portions - and you can avail of two menus: a regular one which lists dishes familiar to the general American public, and a \"Chinese menu\" for more authentic Hong Kong style dishes including a variety of seafood, tofu, and fish dishes. I know I'm going to be a regular here now!"}
{"text":"This place is like lost treasure...  I found it once 10 years ago and I found it again 10 years later. This is the place for a good meal. They were closed for business a decade ago and they recently reopened for business. It is family own and service is very good. Give it a try..."}
{"text":"Hot n sour soup is fantastic.  Beef with snow peas was fresh... crap puffs... wooooohoooooo!  I'm glad we checked it out.  Just bought a house in the area and was glad to find a \"go to\" take out place.  PERFECT."}
{"text":"Last post said closed perm. Was told they were having a grand opening 11/18? Best chinese in phx in my opinion, was devestated. Anyone have a a confirmation?"}
{"text":"Finally! Ive found good take-out Chinese food in Phoenix (if only they delivered I would be a city girl happily in the suburbs). Anyhow, had the Mongolian beef w/brown rice and Spicy string beans w/brown rice. Dee-lish. I am excited to try more from the menu. Fast service too, nice presentation, I love a place that uses the classic Chinese food take out boxes instead of Styrofoam containers. Dont go for dine-in though. The area is sketch and the \"decor\" leaves a lot to be desired. Its best enjoyed at home in comfortable clothes, with a glass of wine."}
{"text":"Food is great as usual. We had the Smooth Egg Beef Noodles (???), Sole Fillet with Turnips Chiu Chow Style (Teochew)-its a sliced fish with a delicious broth, and Sweet & Sour Pork Hong Kong Style.

Only thing about it is, you've got to be patient especially when they are busy."}
{"text":"They have reopened at 1739 W Glendale Ave, Phoenix, AZ 85021.  Checkout the news article on azcentral http://www.azcentral.com/story/entertainment/dining/2014/08/11/silver-dragon-reopens-phoenix/13926751/"}
{"text":"Fantastic Chinese Food.  We had the Ma Po Tofu, garlic eggplant and fish fillets with Chinese vegetables.  No MSG, not very greasy and well prepared.  I used to be married to a Chinese chef so I'm a little picky.  The portions were more than ample."}
{"text":"I heard this was one of the best Chinese restaurants in town, so we decided to try it out for my birthday.  We enjoyed the egg roll, wonton soup, beef chow fun, shrimp fried rice and beef with broccoli.  Everything was fresh, flavorful and tasty even though we did takeout and drove it back home to downtown."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place after looking through Yelp reviews, and I wasn't disappointed! I ordered the sweet and sour chicken off the lunch menu, and it was great. The portion was more than enough, and very cheap (mine was $6.50 and most expensive lunch item was $7). I would recommend this to friends and family!"}
{"text":"Found a newly opened place between Frys & Filibertos.  
CLEAN. Nice Staff. Really Clean. Family owned.

The lunch specials are generous and when I said EXTRA Spicy the server actually believed me so I was happy.  Vegetables were all fresh and cooked with respect (nothing mushy).  

$10 got me lunch, drink & tip so I'll put this place in my work-lunch want to go out but only have an hour Rotation!"}
{"text":"As Jenny was handing me both menus, I asked her if this was the Silver Dragon that originally was on 19th Avenue and Dunlap.

Her eyes lit up, and she exclaimed that yes, that's where they were at years ago before they had to move due to the light rail being extended to that area.

I smiled and promptly motioned her to take away the fraudulent \"English\" menu. \"If I wanted a menu that I could read and understand, I would've gone to Panda Express,\" I summarily quipped. She laughed!

I am very dogmatic about authentic Hong Kong style Chinese Cuisine. I am as serious about it as I am about Kung Fu movies. 

It's not a good, over the top Kung Fu movie, if it doesn't have the need for English subtitles. I don't want the homogenized imitation. Give me the real thing!

I felt like this was a reunion with a long lost, old friend that I hadn't seen in ages. After having parted ways for nearly a decade, I had settled for the fact that I had to drive to Mesa to sample the best of what the valley had to offer in terms of Hong Kong style authenticity. I come from the San Francisco Bay area, and have been to Hong Kong, and I know what good and authentic tastes like.

There used to be 4 in the valley that were notable, but up until this recent visit, the only one that remained true to the faith was the one in Mesa.

And it was simply by chance that I found this place. I was partaking of my alone time by taking the light rail to Mesa, since my wife is busy studying for her finals. And I happened to glance eastward just as the light rail had briefly paused by the intersection on 19th avenue and Glendale.

I'm glad I did! Because this place is truly a gem. No, the decor is not as ornate as the original restaurant was. In fact, this place has more of the vestiges of a cafeteria, than a real restaurant. But, I wasn't going to complain. I found my friend, and I was about to enjoy an amazing meal!

I ordered my usual, from what I could recall seemingly eons ago. Of course, my habit didn't take into account that I used to order for 6, and now I was simply ordering for two.

I ordered more than enough food that Jenny had to ask me twice if I was sure that I wanted to order this much. I just told her that I would have lots of leftovers, then. That settled it, and away she went.

The food was as good as I had remembered. 

First to arrive were the Pan Fried dumplings. They were not overcooked, and the meat inside was just right - perfectly scrumptious. 

Then, the Salt and Pepper pork chop was served. It had a wonderful battered exterior that was very light, and the flavor within was tremendous. Just a delight to the palate.

Then my two most favorite dishes arrived at the same time. 

The House Special Hong Kong Style Chow Mein. It has the larger noodles above with the sauce and meat; as well as, the pan friend angel haired crispy noddles underneath. It was just wonderful!

And the 1/2 Hong Kong Style Crispy chicken with that delicious and beautiful exterior that enveloped the succulent mean underneath would've made any chicken proud to give up their lives for this meal! 

One note to point out is the interesting dynamics of places like these, and the newbies that dine here. There was plenty of gawking from the diners who were unfamiliar with the variety of dishes being offered in the \"secret and subtitled menu.\"

The Asian gentleman, that was dining with his family, who stood up to peruse the dishes that were being brought out, and the blonde lady that stood up and walked over to see what I was having, were just typical and expected examples of what can be expected when dining here.

I just thought the lady was so rude that she would just walk over, and she didn't even bother to introduce herself while taking a quick peek! I'm just kidding, of course.

As expected, I had plenty of leftovers to bring home to my wife. She reunited her palate with a long lost friend, that has now been found!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad that Silver Dragon is back with the same owners. Our family use to come to their place on Dunlap religiously as kids growing up back in the 90's. The 2 main things that I highly recommend getting is their  beef stew and  Hong Kong Style soup dumpling. It is one of the most flavorful and tender Chinese beef stews you can find in the valley.  Even my grandparents have no issue eating this. And their soup dumplings are made to perfection, with just the right amount of pork and shrimp. Remember to ask for the Chinese menu when ordering, this has more of the authentic Chinese food offerings. And don't worry there is English on the Chinese Menu :)."}
{"text":"Some of the most unique vegetarian options in town, with lack luster service.

Inside of this old fast food joint is some soild Chinese food. Note they have two menus and some of the best stuff is on the Chinese menu.

The Buddhist rolls, essentially a huge order (8) of mushroom egg rolls, nice and crisp full of molten hot mushrooms.

The Buddhist style vegetable dish has some really unique and fun mushrooms including one that looks like waves.

Overall good food, inexpensive just know that you may have to ask to get what you want as the service is not the best."}
{"text":"I must disclose I frequent a similar restaurant on the west side so I compare what I had from Silver Dragon to the other place. I kept reading GLOWING reviews from the Arizona Republic about this place and also noticed all the rewards the Arizona Republic awarded this place so I thought I must give it a try. I also note that I may not have tried the dishes that suit me most.

Silver Dragon is a small independently owned restaurant that offers Hong Kong Style Food. They offer American Chinese Favorites on one menu and have another menu of Authentic Style Chinese Food.

We started with the Buddhist Style Rolls. If I never had them before I'd think they were good. I'm used to them being tasty, crispy, light and not oily. These were stuffed with more vegetables but the tofu skin had a chewy texture that I don't like as much. These had less flavor and also leaked oil. For me they were not as good as I'm used too.

The dish that I tried that was a good solid dish was the Yu Fu with Eggplant. The Yu Fu is described as some sort of fish and egg dumpling. It was very fluffy and light and didn't taste like fish at all. This dish had nice flavors that anybody would like.

We did some take out to have latter.

I've had Fungus and Tofu before so I had an expectation of what it might be like. The Fungus from here looked similar but might have been a different kind as it had a texture to it that was very different. The fungus from Silver Dragon was had a tough thin but almost crunchy kind of texture unlike the delicate soft delicate kind I had before. The soup part was not for me and might be delicious to other people. It was sort of like egg drop mixed with pieces of fish and shrimp with chunks of tofu and the chunks of fungus. 

We took home the two Filet Mignon Dishes they make. One is called French Style and the Other is called Hong Kong Style. I do note that both dishes gave you LOTS of buttery soft beef. Maybe due to my taste I didn't find either one delicious and to me were really OK at best. The French Style had very little flavor and tasted like weak beef stock. The Hong Kong Style did have more flavor but it was unbalanced and on the sweet side.

It's possible that with all the Hype from the Arizona Republic that they were scrambling to feed the new masses of people and may be not have been working on full speed so my exsperience might not be typical. Also my taste may differ from yours. You will certainly get very large portions that contain large amounts of meat here.

Worth a try get the Yu Fu!"}
{"text":"I am very lucky to live not too far from this amazing Chinese restaurant. I usually order takeout, and takes only about 10-15 minutes. The staff is very friendly and most importantly the food is great. The food always comes out hot and tastes great, the rice is cooked well, and i've yet to order something here that I dislike. 
One thing to note is this restaurant has two menus. First you have your English-Chinese food that has all your Chinese food classics, and a Chinese menu that features traditional Hong Kong food (and luckily they have English subtitles). 
What really makes this Chinese restaurant special is their authentic Chinese menu. Definitely explore both menus, and you'll find good things on both. If you want to be adventurous and order off the authentic Chinese menu i'd recommend the crispy hong kong style chicken, the spicy string beans, or crystal shrimp w/ nuts. 
And a quick tip: the bitter melon is pretty bitter if your palate isn't used to it, but if you love trying new dishes, or those classic American Chinese dishes this is definitely the spot!"}
{"text":"Service painfully slow,  if you are looking for a spot that will waist your time then you found the right spot.  The atmosphere in this place is not pleasent.  The place is run down, the staff has a bit of a language barrior when ordering at the counter.   Also waiting 30+ mins hot 2 simple take out dishes.   I don't recomed this place,   you could have a better experience at the buffet and have a better selection for the value."}
{"text":"This is a great place. The food was delicious, and the wait staff were attentive. They took our orders promptly and always made sure the drinks were filled. I haven't had Chinese food this good at a local place in a long time. It was a welcome change. The restaurant and bathrooms were both clean as well. The only downside is the somewhat shady part of town it's in. While we were eating, a guy came in and asked my friend if he could repair the damage to her car (totally unrelated to anything going on). 
I'll definitely be eating there again."}
{"text":"Yay Silver Dragon is back!  Our family used to go back when it was on 19th avenue and Dunlap.  There is no other place I got to for wonton noodle soup.  Never order off the American menu (if they have one).  Go and ask for a bowl of wontons.  You can get them with noodle or without.  They are heavenly.  Skip the fried potstickers (they taste a little like the ones you get at Costco).  This is homestyle Chinese food.  The décor and ambiance is zero.  The service is friendly enough but brisk.  You are eating in what looks like an old Wendy's after all.  The braised dishes and vegetables are outstanding.  The fried rice not so much.  Chicken will be served Asian style, cold and hacked to pieces so beware of bones.  Take out is super fast and is ready by the time I'm there.  (Better ambiance at home anyway).  But yes, get the wontons, you won't regret it!  PS you know it's good when every time I've been in, there are actual real, live, multi-generational Asian families pointed their chopsticks at each other.  This is how you know it's the real deal.  Bonus: it is really reasonably priced."}
{"text":"We got some Silver Dragon takeout on a Sunday night after a long weekend. Their full menu is online and phone ordering was a breeze. When we arrived, we found the dining room filled with tables of -- how do I state this in a PC manner -- families who looked like they REALLY knew a thing or two about good chinese food. So I took it as a good sign.

We ordered the spicy string beans, egg rolls, house fried rice, and some shrimp thing. Everything was good. It was simple, of course, but they do what they do and they do it well.

It's reasonably priced which, compared to our last go-to chinese place, Diamonds, was a bit of a price increase. But the service was prompt and the food was good. I'll leave this bookmark on my list."}
{"text":"The food tastes like authentic Chinese food. And the service is better than the usual authentic Chinese places. Prices are getting up there by a dollar, and the food portions are not as big as other places.

Maybe it's a \"better service\" at the expense of \"big food portions.\" I don't know... I probably take more food over service. Just saying as an Asian person. haha.

This was during dinner and the place had a lot of people so that's always a good sign. The menu had some good varieties too. And like I said, it's authentic taste. Unless you get something that's specifically made for Americans. Then you get authentic American taste."}
{"text":"horrible experience! they obviously didn't get our order into the kitchen.  After an hour of waiting, my husband was curtly told they were busy, and he said, we've been waiting an hour!  15 min. later, another conversation, a new waitress, and 1 of 4 dishes delivered.  Another 8 min. all dishes delivered.  Nothing special.   

No apology, no urgency, we won't be going back."}
{"text":"i like this place.. i was given a word of mouth referral to try the food.. i was not disappointed .. you will like the food too.. come and try it for yourself."}
{"text":"I was a little turned off by the appearance of this restaurant but my boyfriend and I were craving Chinese and this place is super close to our apartment. We were pleasantly surprised, the food, while nothing special, was decent tasting/quality and reasonably priced. If you're just looking for the standard Chinese take-out/delivery fare this place is worth a shot."}
{"text":"Good food and 2 menu's to choose from. Friendly staff and remember they close at 5pm."}
{"text":"My husband's Chinese friend highly recommended this place so we visited on Sunday afternoon around two . The place wasn't too busy and we were seated immediately and served our drinks. Ordered the Buddhist rolls and the friendly waitress explained a full order might be too much so we got the half order which was still too much but absolutely delicious , 4 hot crispy crunchy nuggets filled with savory mushrooms and other Chinese veggies. Husband ordered the French style filet mignon with black pepper sauce which was amazingly tender and out of this world. Husband is used to spicy food and thought it was a bit bland but trust me it is worth every penny of the $13.00. We also had the Eight Delight Mei (Hong Kong style) and it too was very good. Service was excellent and we left with smiles on our faces promising to return soon."}
{"text":"Super nice and helpful lady and man took my carry out order.

The few times I've walked in here, the place is always clean. I'm greeted quickly and if I keep walking to the counter they know its for to go. 

Recently I've gotten the Star Shrimp. Its about 10 jumbo shrimp with a special chief sauce. I can taste mayo in it. It came with glazed walnuts coated with sesame seeds. Delicious! Except for the couple bites where I could really taste the mayo LoL.

I can't remember the two other times what I got. I guess thats what I get for taking my time to write this. All I can tell you, like many chinese food, its enough for dinner and lunch the next day.

Damn, I'm annoyed I can't remember. And there's no menu listed to jog my memory - sorry guys!"}
{"text":"Man this place is fantastic. Located inside of an old Taco Bell you can find some great authentic Chinese food. Service is far from five star but I left happy and full. Had I believed a fried salted beef dish that was fantastic. Dumpling soup is also amazing. This place won't blow you away with looks or service but just with amazing authentic food."}
{"text":"Silver Dragon! They were the only good Chinese restaurant back in the day.

They remain the same. Friendly service with solid food."}
{"text":"So they are CLOSED NOW at 5PM EVERY DAY they are open. WEIRD! Ruined my dinner plans. I was finally going to give it another go after violently vomiting after my first/last to-go order 3 months ago."}
{"text":"The food is great!  Service is terrible, however. They basically have one server and one young man doing table set-up and clean-up. My sister and I went on a Saturday night. They were very busy with dine-in and take out patrons. The poor server was obviously overwhelmed. We had to wait a long time for our order to be taken and then about 45 minutes got it to be delivered. Most likely I will go again, but will choose a time when I hope they will be less busy.   Probably will do take- out.  My sister, unfortunately, will never go again."}
{"text":"First time here, and really liked it. My lunch companion ordered off the Chinese menu in Chinese so I don't technically even know what we had by name, so description will do. Appetizer was mushroom mixture wrapped in cabbage and dipped in tempura. Delicate and crispy at the same time. So good. Next was seafood in a white sauce with flat rice noodles, a little Chinese broccoli (think broccoli rabe not florets) and carrot, maybe a mushroom or two. The fish was perfect. Delicate, not overcooked, shrimp and squid in there too I believe. A crispy salted sole, that's amazing. Definitely even better with the jalapeno, onion, and crispy bits on the fish. This was on several tables, and I know why. The other dish was strips of pork and beans sprouts in a brown sauce over a bed of very thin wheat noodles that are crisped up on a cooktop before topped. The extra crispy bits are really good in the soft sauce. Service was good, would definitely recommend if you are in that neighborhood."}
{"text":"Ok folks great Chinese food here!!!! They have a really good walnut shrimp aka crystal shrimp aka mayonnaise shrimp aka honey walnut shrimp. Lots of aliases for one dish! Not as good as Gina's from Big Wong moment of silence........... but very close! I definitely recommend ordering off the Chinese menu! The French style filet is sublime! The filet is tender and delicious! The beef chow fun doesn't disappoint either delish! The Singapore rice noodle is sooooooooooooo good.                                                     I highly recommend going here be adventurous try the Chinese menu the dishes are way better!"}
{"text":"Still my favorite place in town for Chinese!  Everything is SUPER fresh! I'm kinda picky with chicken to the point that I only eat it at home.  The chicken here always tastes freshly prepared not rubbery or gross like lots of places.  The sauce for their lemon chicken and orange chicken is my favorite of anywhere I've been they actually fresh squeeze the citrus juice into their sauces  thanks Silver Dragon for never disappointing!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is clean.  They offer a regular menu as well as a \"Chinese\" menu.  Generally, I order off the \"Chinese\" menu, this gives me the opportunity to get some authentic \"home-style\" cooking, like my mom would make it.  The staff is really quick and kind. The food is so good and authentic, today I decided to have the Sui Kui (dumpling soup) and Beef Chow Fun (rice noodles)"}
{"text":"We were so happy to hear that Silver Dragon had reopened.  They serve authentic Hong Kong style cuisine and is just as good as I remembered it.  The crew is attentive and polite.  If you're not sure what to try, here are a few of my family's favorites there: Salt and Pepper Fish Fillet, Spicy String Beans, 8 Delight Hong Kong (Pan Fried) Noodles, Beef Tendon Hot Pot, Westlake Beef Soup and Hong King Style Beef Tenderloin.

If you are interested in trying something different and authentic then Silver Dragon is a restaurant you need to give it a try.  I'd recommend ordering several dishes and sharing them family style for more variety."}
{"text":"I tried the Singapore noodles and Beef with Chinese vegetables. Both were excellent. 

The noodles were seasoned with curry and the texture was spot on. The thin sliced beef was extremely tender (velveted) with leafy greens that had a slight pepper flavor. Similar to mustard greens but different. The steamed rice was good. Both entrees had generous portions. 

Silver Dragon is my favorite Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"LOVE that Silver Dragon is back, after being gone for seven years. We adore the staff and  the food!!!!"}
{"text":"Great flavor and fresh taste 
Ordered sweet and sour chicken, hot and sour soup, and veggie lo mien. 
Portions could have been larger for price, but I would recommend."}
{"text":"They have a menu for unsuspecting Americans with the classic Chinese food you would expect. The really yummy food is in the Chinese menu.  Be bold."}
{"text":"I haven't tried a lot of their food yet... but wow their chicken wings are the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"I was surprised that this location has changed hands yet again. The \"new owners\" told my wife (in Chinese because she is Chinese) that they didn't know where the old owners went??? Right. Anyway, the food is not really bad, but it is much more traditional Chinese food instead of the Americanized version most of us are accustomed to. (White Fungus Tofu Soup, Yu Fu, Bitter Melon, etc.) The portions are definitely smaller and the prices are considerably higher. The menu I was given, I hope, is just a transitional menu and the real ones are at the printers as we speak. I say this because there are no appetizers like egg rolls, won ton soup, etc at all on the menu I saw. Also there are no combination plates or lunch specials that I could see. The old restaurant had a better selection, lower prices and bigger portions yet still could not make it. I feel certain these guys won't be around for very long either. I doubt we will return."}
{"text":"Sunday night Chinese food run and I was really hoping for fabulous food based off all the reviews. This was our first time trying Silver Dragon and sorry to say the food was just average. I really liked the Crystal Shrimp but the sweet & sour chicken along with the crab puffs left a lot to be desired.  The portion sizes were pretty small as well compared to other Chinese takeout restaurants.   

Maybe it was our selection from the menu, ill have to give a high rated menu item a shot if we ever decide to return."}
{"text":"The Silver Dragon is back! This old favorite from 19th ave. and Dunlap is back at a new location. I got a half crispy chicken off the Chinese menu, Wor Wonton soup, shrimp w/ black bean sauce and house fried rice. De-licious! And a bunch of leftovers,  too! Doing my happy dance!"}
{"text":"food was okay. i would eat here again on the lunch menue. the parking is not good and it's a samll parking lot with tight parking spaces."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and even at their previous location. Not much has changed except the restaurant doesnt look as nice.

I got the fu yu, some scallop soup (listed third on menu), and fish with veggies. Taste-wise was pretty okay. The amount of oil they use is completely unnecessary.... Dishes swim in oil and if you can get past nomming down on something and oil gushing out of the mushroom or veggie or whatever, then its ok.

Winter melon soups tasted better. Wasn't a fan of today's soup choice.

Rice is complimentary as well as the hot tea."}
{"text":"My girlfriend found this little gem about 2 weeks ago. And let's just say we've both been craving more and more chinese/japanese food since she discovered this place. We've tried their egg rolls, kung pao chicken, sweet and hot shrimp, bbq pork fried rice. Everything we've ha there so fard has been delicious. Employees are polite and fast! We'll definately be coming here more often."}
{"text":"Its been awhile since I have been able to find a good Cantonese/Hong Kong style restaurant in the Central Phoenix Area. I'm so happy that I was finally able to try this little gem. 

There are two menus, a smaller English one and the full Chinese one. If you know any traditional Chinese dishes, I would look at the full menu. Its written in Chinese with the english translation. 

We ordere: 
* West Lake Beef Tofu Soup - YUM! There was about 5-6 bowls worth in the bowl
* Salt and Pepper Shrimp - Pretty good. The shrimp were large, I just wish it was fried a little more and with more garlics and jalapenos. The taste was good.
* Beef Chow Fun (dry) - Good enough to satisfy my cravings, but nothing compared to Cali status restaurants. 

Overall, this place is great! It satisfies my Cantonese food cravings without going very far out of the area. The price is average, but the service is fantastic! Hopefully I will be able to come back here soon, I just wish the hours weren't so odd or they were open for dinner :(

{"text":"Probably one of the most consistently good Chinese restaurant in town.  it is family run and it has a typical family-run ambiance if you know what I mean.  Food is always well made, consistent and reasonable portion size, and this place never disappoints.  it is our go-to place if we are ever in the mood for Chinese food (and my whole family is Chinese)."}
{"text":"So every time I've passed by the parking lot has been full. I figured I'd give it a try. It's really close to my house. We sit drinks are brought quickly and then things went down hill from there. We order and then wait, and wait, and wait. The place started filling up and it was obvious they were greatly understaffed. Our soup finally came. Sizzling Rice Soup. You know that sizzling sound your supposed to hear; no sound and I've never had the rice crunchy before. Then my ribs came and they were cold. In the restaurant business cold food is a death sentence as far as I'm concerned. Then we waited for our entrees. We waited and waited and waited. If I wanted anything like chopsticks, water, sweet and sour sauce or mustard I had to get up to find someone to get them to bring me what I wanted. I have two really good Chinese restaurants to recommend. China Chili and Shangrila. I won't be back to Silver Dragon."}
{"text":"I just had dinner here and can say that it is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Phoenix. The food was delicious, authentic, and served piping hot. It is also very inexpensive to boot. The only bad part was that the servers seemed a little overwhelmed by the rush of people, and told us that this was unusual and due to a just-released review by the Phoenix New Times. I think, however, that the slow service will correct itself as more servers get hired to accommodate larger crowds.

On to the food. My girlfriend and I asked for the Chinese menu, and you should too. We began with the dried scallop winter melon soup. It was piping hot and delicately flavored, exactly as it should be. We also had an order of crab puffs, which are the best I have ever had. The puff itself was paper thin, crispy but not the slightest bit greasy, and with just the right amount of crab and cream cheese in the middle.

For our entrées we ordered the Yu Fu with Eggplant and XO Scallops, both of which were excellent, moist, and flavorful. We were presented with wonderful white rice that was steaming hot, and yet dry, which was a great accompaniment to the moist entrées.

All in all, it would be difficult to go wrong here. Just make sure you ask for the Chinese menu."}
{"text":"Yay! We have now found a go-to place for real, authentic Chinese food. Coming from the West Valley, the other option was to drive the 40 minutes to get to Mesa/Chandler. No more! This restauran tucked away in a small, unassuming strip mall right after the Fry's Supermarket. Decor was lackluster, but that's to be expected at an authentic Chinese restaurant. This is a no-frills place that reminds me of having good Cantonese food back home in NYC/NJ (where the Chinese population is much larger). We had the Young Chow fried rice, beef tendon stew in brown sauce, and assorted seafood with fried milk balls. All 3 dishes were very good and each dish was roughly about $10. It's definitely worth being a little brave and trying the authentic food - why come here for the sweet and sour pork, lemon chicken, or General Tso's when you get that at any Chinese restaurant around the corner?"}
{"text":"First thing I noticed about this restaurant was the mix of well balanced Asian and American patrons dining here. I also noticed they were lacking a large fish tank where they would have kept fresh crabs/fish/lobsters. They removed crab entrees from their menu although it clearly showed on the older photos of menu from Yelpers. But that's okay. There were plenty of other dishes we wanted to try.
We noticed they had wide selection of chow fun so had to order beef chow fun with black bean sauce. It was good but I was not all that impressed. Also tried the Choy Sum vegetable dish. It was fresh and had a nice crunch but wish the flavor had infused more into the vegetable. 
Lastly, our beef/tendon turnip hotpot was decent, had good flavor. However, the turnip was too firm, tasted like it was cooked separately and added in later like an afterthought.
Overall, I think they deserve a 3.5 stars but not enough for a 4. Sorry I really wanted to like this restaurant."}
{"text":"I was expecting the \"old\" Silver Dragon and was disappointed. The food was okay but didn't have much flavor. The curry chicken was bland and the hot&sour soup didn't have much heat. The Hong Kong beef was wonderful though! The beef was so tender and delicious. 

Also, the bathroom was disgusting, with the urinal having a leak that was \"fixed\" with paper towels."}
{"text":"This has to be the best Chinese food in town.  The rice and Singapore noodles were succulently delicious.  The appetizer sampler will blow you away!  Totally recommend this very delicious restaurant!"}
{"text":"The food is AMAZING but they really, REALLY need to take the fluorescent menu light down or put a screen up to keep that out of diner's eyes.  Otherwise the place is great!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has been around for many years but took a hiatus for a few years and ended up at the current location. 

The food is always consistent and authentic old school Cantonese style.  

The Dumpling Soup is excellent with large dumplings in a simple base soup. 

The Chinese Crispy Chicken is as authentic as you can get, well prepared and skin has the right snap. 

The Salt and Pepper Fish may be the best dish that they prepare, just a little kick with jalapeños to give it some taste but not hot.

The Chow Fun topped with Chinese Broccoli and Beef is very tasty with the noodles having good consistency and flavor.

Of course their Sweet and Sour Pork is very well prepared and firm.

Service is pretty good, but limited in parking, make sure you don't park next door at Filibertos or your car could be towed away.

Overall good food at decent prices with authentic Chinese."}
