{"text":"Good sushi...we especially liked the chef specials and the salad.   Eclectic atmosphere....has a French cafe type feel."}
{"text":"Great sushi place.   Great prices.   Superbe location.   Friendly staff.   We can order too  Be careful as this place doesn't serve alcohol. But to be honest I like it that way. It keeps the price down.   The decor is very unusual for a sushi place but that is why I like about it.   I just love the place as going there or takeout for eating in the nearby park."}
{"text":"Montreal has a very weird sushi scene. Ask 10 people what the best place is, and you'll get 10 different answers. Probably because nothing really stands out, sadly. Tri express, opened by the old chef (Tri, a short tattooed dude) at Kaizen, is good when compared to the overall scene, but not quite what I wish it was.  Pros - better than the never-ending mediocre sushi places in this city - the Tri specials are quite good - cool lil hipster place - Best bet: ask them to give you a mean for \"x\" amount of money, say 30$ a head and they'll do a great job at curating a good selecting  Cons - can be expensive. Takeout for 2 was just over 100$, and we only enjoyed 2/3 of the pieces we had, as some were bland. They do however have budget options, where you tell them # of people and budget. - if ordering takeout, they don't even take a second to tell you what is what. Found that unimpressive  In summary, I think Yuukai stands out far and ahead of this place, for those who don't have the budget to go to Park or Juni"}
{"text":"Place à sushi très réputée sur Le Plateau pour la qualité de ses plats. C'est tout de même un peu dispendieux, mais vraiment beau câlice !"}
{"text":"A few quick points worth noting:  *CASH ONLY. Be sure to have a pocket full of guap. *NO ALCOHOL. If you're into pairing wine with your sushi, this ain't the place for you. *RESERVE YOUR PARTY. It's highly advised that you call ahead to avoid the wait.  Peep the photos in my review and you'll regret not coming sooner. FYI, your honored cutie will be mesmerized with the decor and vibe. Style and cool points are definitely in your future my friend.  Tri Express and I have quite a few things in common. We are both nestled in a hipster village, rich in texture, small in stature but full in flavor, and are both accessible by the Orange Line; Tri via STM in The Plateau (Laurier), and me via MBTA in Jamaica Plain. That only means one thing: We were absolutely destined to cross paths and culinarily knock boots, with the aid of some chop sticks. Kinky I know.  The staff here are very personable and easy to spark a conversation with. The sushi chefs suggested spots to hit that locals frequent for a nights worth of some good times. You guys were great! We'll meet again very soon.    *Beantowns Finest*"}
{"text":"L'année dernière, ce resto faisait mon bonheur en terme de fraicheur, innovation et qualité. Depuis mars, j'y suis allé 2 fois (à emporter), et j'ai été déçue à chaque fois. La qualité n'est plus au rendez-vous, le riz est quelconque et les poissons plus aussi goûteux.  Le resto reste bon, mais ne vaut certainement plus la foule qui s'y presse."}
{"text":"Average at best, very blend flavours everything tastes the same after the first bite, cash only."}
{"text":"Super sympa, simple et très bon. Un petit resto à ajouter à votre carnet d'adresse!!!"}
{"text":"Japanese cuisine revisited. Very good. You should certainly try the sushi pizza!"}
{"text":"For me, It's the best sushi in montreal,  OK this place has so many good dishes, best is to go with friends, like 4 ppl is the best so you can really order some food, and sample. The place is small, it's casual, eat and go place, and the service is very efficient.  First the salads, both the lobster and filet mignon (seared but rare) salads are good, trust me you have never had salad like this before!!!  The chef has this \"mix\" that he calls \"Tri's\" , it's basically tobiko, tempura (which are like salty rice crispies) mixed with your selected fish or lobster and spicy mayo. it's good but it can get rich if you order too much of it. I recommend one or two dishes of the Tri style. The Tri style is peppered throughout the menu...  The sushi pizza is worth a mention, it's pricey but feeds 2-4 ppl. The topping is Tri style and easily 10 cm tall, lol. you can have it with salmon or tuna or lobster if you want something cooked.  The Sashimi (salmon or tuna or both) is the most original and tasty I've ever had anywhere. it comes drenched in soy sauce, with spicy sprinkles, roasted sesame seeds, and granny smith  juliennes. The soy sauce is perfectly balanced. I'm not too fond of sashimi, but this one I always order when I'm here...  Of the rolls, special mention to the cucumber roll, it's called  \"le divin\" instead of nori, it is rolled with cucumber, it comes with special soy sauce and it's fresh and light.  The other roll i like is the \"favori de Tri\" which is wrapped in rice paper, original. The fish here is always top notch and fresh!!! though it would be nice if the slices were thicker...  I've brought friends from all over and they all liked it because it's quite different from regular sushi places... even the sushi snobs from NYC and vancouver like this place so there you go ;)  oh and remember cash only !!! about 30$ per person, 45$ if you're a pig :P"}
{"text":"We went there for Valentines Day.  Place was packed.  Ordered Omakase I and Omakase II (see menu on the website) plus miso soup and the salad ceviche.  The salad and sashimi was pretty tasty and well presented and served to build anticipation for the sushi and maki.  But we were utterly disappointed with the sushi and maki.  Dont look fresh, the rice was too dry.  They looked like something you'd find at a cheap sushi stand in a mall's food court.  Very very disappointing.  The miso soup was very average. It had lots (too much?) of green leafs, enoki mushrooms (he likes to use that everywhere it seems) and seaweeds. That probably diluted the whole miso soup taste.  I only found literally four pieces of thin \"seafood\" in my seafood ceviche salad. Pretty disappointing experience. Maybe we didn't order the \"right\" things or maybe we did not choose the right time to go (it was a very busy night) but that should not be an excuse.  Considering the price, we have to say it's overrated.  We had much much better sushi elsewhere for the same price or less."}
{"text":"Cute but underwhelming sushi restaurant. I'm all in favor of new and innovative combinations of flavors and textures. But after two visits, I'm not convinced. At the end of the day, everything seems to taste the same, drenched in their house sauces with the fish mashed into mush."}
{"text":"Un des meilleurs sushis en ville!  La pizza sushi est à essayer et le spécial tri un delice! Par contre c'est très prisé et souvent plein. Ils font aussi à emporter mais j'ai préféré mon expérience sur place."}
{"text":"La première fois que j'y suis allée (il y a environ 3 ans), j'ai mangé les meilleurs sushis de ma vie!  Au cours de la dernière année, j'y suis allée à quelques reprises et la qualité des plats diminuait chaque fois... J'y suis allée hier et c'était décevant...   Points positifs: Les sashimis à la Tri (petit craquelin sur lequel est déposé un mélange de homard (ou autres fruits de mer), de tempura et d'oeufs de poissons)) sont hallucinants! C'est délicieux! La déco' du resto est superbe et, heureusement, le resto a agrandi! Si vous êtes deux, je vous recommande de manger au comptoir pour voir les cuisiniers préparer les sushis et pour ne pas être coincés à côté d'une autre table.   Le service est sympathique, mais un peu trop rapide. Pour une soirée tranquille en amoureux, ce resto est peut-être moins l'idéal. Par contre, on peut faire une commande pour emporter.  Points négatifs:  Nous avions pris l'Omakaze (25$ par personne, taxes incluses, comprenant une entrée de saumon dans une sauce vinaigrée, 4 sashimis à la Tri, deux rouleaux \"spécialité du chef\" (le Divin et l'Inspiré), deux autres rouleaux makis et 4 sushis (saumon et thon)). Hormis les sashimis à la Tri, tous les autres sushis étaient ordinaires... Le saumon en entrée manquait de fraîcheur et tous les autres sushis manquaient de saveur. Le Divin est un concassé de homard enroulé dans une tranche de concombre. Le concombre était blanc, mou et peu goûteux. Le mélange utilisé dans les sashimis à la Tri est incroyablement bon. Toutefois, il perd de son charme puisqu'il s'est retrouvé dans la plupart de nos sushis.  Également, les sushis (boule de riz avec une tranche de poisson) étaient minuscules et le poisson était similaire à celui offert chez Sushi Shop....   Il faut également savoir que ce n'est PAS un resto typiquement japonais. On n'y va pas pour l'authenticité des sushis ni pour la mise en valeur du poisson frais, mais plutôt pour goûter à la créativité des cuisiniers qui préparent (parfois bien, parfois moins bien) un mélange de poisson ou de fruits de mer concassés, avec des légumes ou des fruits.   Réservation recommandée et argent comptant seulement."}
{"text":"Dnsjahwidnemsknegngnrjejebrbw  THIS PLACE IS JUST AMAZING. I have never tried sushis as good since I've been in Vancouver .  Not much picture because I was with a group of people and it looked too odd! Yeah I'm old fashion , I have to let others enjoy their food before harassing them for a picture ...   Anyway , the restaurant is mad busy so don't bother coming without a reservation if your party is more than three. THEY STILL DO OFFER TAKEOUTS , y'all should take that in note :)   I'm a bit biased as I was invited for an event that was pretty made by the son's owner . However , the cuisine and the food was impeccable , I think I'm pretty much in one with that place . Service is very efficient and fast .   The crowd is young , trendy and hipster . But no worries everyone is accepted in this place , they will still serve you with a big smile hehehe.  Food is great , or A to the M TO THE A TO SO ZINGGGGG , can you hear me now ? It's just freaking amazing . Y'all gotta try the salad cause the sauce tastes so good and me likes when it melts within mah mouth .  The rolls are huge and very well made , I am saying this as I have experienced Vancouver Japanese cuisine and this is on par ! Did you hear me yelper? IT IS ON PAR!  Okay me thinks I'm going a little crazy , but tri express is definitely a must try in term of sushi WITHIN MONTREAL .  Worry less about my words , and go discover this charming place . Hey I'll for sure become a regular here :$"}
{"text":"Best japaneese food in Montréal! If you take out, you have to wait 30 min minimum and outside. You have to know that"}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had in Montreal. We usually take a set menu at 25$ which gets us the lot: sushi tartare, sashimi, sushi, maki. Always leaving with a very full stomach. Always very fresh and the service is quick. I would advise to make a reservation even if you go on a week day as the place is tiny and fills up very quickly. Also, they only take cash."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town. It's an old school diner converted into a sushi restaurant, and all the decorations were created by the main man Tri himself, and there's an absolute Plateau charm to the place.  And the food--well, like I said, best sushi in town. Pricey? Budget between $30-40 per person. And make a reservation if you're there for a Thursday, Friday, or Saturday night."}
{"text":"Extremely poor service (food is great though)  I went yesterday with my girlfriend and the server was very rude since we arrived as he told us inappropriately that we couldn't seat in a table (for 2) because it was supposed to be for 6 (when moved next to another table for 4). OK, fine we sat in another table. We ordered many things including tartare. My girlfriend asked for crackers for the tartare and the server said (in french) : \"more? appart from the one that is underneath the tartare? She said yes, and then with a nonchalant attitude he brought 3 mini crackers. After 5 minutes, I wanted to eat my tartare and also wanted crackers so I asked again and he asked me rudely: \"How many?\". I said 10, for the sake of saying something. When we left, they charged us 2.60 dollars for these crackers that you can find at costco for 5 dollars the box. I will never go back to this place. No need to feel that someone is making you a favor when selling you crackers! I prefer going to sushi shop and eat poor sushi than going to this place. Good food shouldn't come at any price."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi in Montreal, a city with pretty terrible sushi, but Triexpress is fantastic. The atmosphere is eclectic and cozy, the bar is the best seat to watch the chefs at work, and their tri-express special sashimi (look for the lobster specifically) can't be missed. the Laurier is a great roll, and going for the \"chef's inspiration\" never disappoints. Its cash only, and no alcohol, but you won't miss not being able to wash your meal down with wine or sake. Don't tell to many people, its already difficult to get a seat on the weekend."}
{"text":"Plus cher que d'autres restaurants de sushis mais tellement bon ! Personnellement je préfère commander à emporter que manger sur place. L'endroit est petit et l'on est poussé vers la sortie dès que notre assiette est terminée."}
{"text":"There's been a lot of hype about this place over the years but I never quite understood why. It's small, cramped, and doesn't have a liquor license. The food is OK, but unfortunately the same flavours come out in most of their sushi rolls, so one gets very sick of that mayo/tempura/secret sauce combo that seems to be everywhere. I never found the service to be that friendly either... There are much better experiences to be had at other sushi spots in the city."}
{"text":"I relish visiting Montreal because of Tri Express. I've been tempted to buy a plane ticket just to eat there. Chef Tri is the rockstar of the sushi world and I'm totally and unabashedly a groupie. I don't throw my panties at him when he's making sushi but the food is that good that I've been tempted too. I first encountered his genius ingredient pairings when he was at Kaizen and also at Le Petit Treehouse but I much prefer his latest incarnation at Tri Express. C'est magnifique!  Tips: Go with a few people (max 4... the tables are tiny!) and order Omakase III. It is the best way to experience his mastery at work."}
{"text":"C'est mon restaurant de sushis préféré à Montréal! Il propose des mets de sushis atypiques se démarquant des autres restaurants de sushis habituels, le tout esthétiquement beau et bon! Les prix ne sont pas excessifs. Possibilité de partager des plats de sushis différents. Souvent assez achalandé, il est recommandé de réserver avant d'y aller."}
{"text":"My favorite  sushi place in Montreal. The owner is the former sushi chef at Kaizen. It's always packed so I do take-out. They have 50$ menu for two that can't be beat. Anywhere. Ever."}
{"text":"They have good sushis but the service is terrible. Second time that I order a filet mignon  salad (18$) and when I get home with my order they give me the salad but no filet mignon. What is that.? It is very frustrating for somewhere that expensive who only takes cash to not even give you the order properly. on top if that they put their soups in containers that can't stand the heat. So an order for 2 people for 130$ no salad no soup when you get home... and when I call them they tell me well we can give you a credit for next time I hope so!!"}
{"text":"Une décoration surprenante ,hétéroclite et très originale. Des sushis de très grandes qualités gustatives. les présentations des produits sont travaillés . Il s'agit vraiment d'un bon restaurant asiatique qui en vaut le détour."}
{"text":"Je trouve que c'est les meilleurs sushi pour le prix à Montréal!"}
{"text":"I tried the omakase I and it was good! Loved the first plate. It's perfect for dates and very romantic ambiance with all the decorations, even the toilet was decorated. I noticed they have lots of pick up orders and staffs were nice."}
{"text":"I like the tartare. The maki is not as good as I thought. I like the decorations. The place is not small. It's bright and comfortable."}
{"text":"Best sushi experience in montreal! So fresh, so tasty! We took the 15 pieces menu, it was amazing! The deco of this place seems a bit random, and it looks like nothing fancy. But the food is really fresh and taste great! They take cash only, there's an ATM right at the entrance though."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. A kind of expensive but you will get excellent sushi for that.  although the restaurant was full, we got our diner within 20min. If you like sushi, it is the place to be in montreal."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place in Montreal! I almost gave 5 stars, but there are small drawbacks--you have to pay cash, there are no desserts, we did not have much space to move around, and we waited close to 10 minutes for our table even with a reservation. But once you are sitting down, the service is fast, the staff is nice, and most importantly, the food is really delicious! I really liked the both the salad and the sushi. The decor is quite original for a sushi place. It's a good location--about 10 minutes away from Métro Laurier, and I really enjoy walking down Laurier street anyway :) I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"What a gigantesque disappointment! This place is nothing close to be good. Service (two girls on Sunday) very unpleasant, you could have impression that they are pissed off to serve you. Food: avocado was too old and black already, salad ceviche has NOTHING in common with ceviche in real, they serve you mountain of salad with 4 small sashimi pieces of fish, where tuna smell nothing fresh! For god sake it's sushi! I had to throw it out! Hamachi a la tri: if you like tempura with indefinite taste on crackers... Go for it! JUST BAD!! Never again!"}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi in town. Tri had blessed several other notable sushi restaurants with his talents before opening up his own spot deep in the residential area of the Plateau.  We've never visited without him sending over an order of his specialty on the house. Tri Express has very few tables and they close up really early (9pm) weekdays. Weekends til 10pm, and although they don't serve Alcohol its not a BYO.  They do have a huge picnic table outside and they don't mind you bringing over a bottle for your meal."}
{"text":"Définitivement les meilleurs sushis que j'ai jamais mangé jusqu'à aujourd'hui ! Et pour un prix très correct :Nous étions 6 et avons eu droit à une explosion de saveurs et de couleurs pour 25$/pers dans une cadre très original et chaleureux.  Essayez, c'est même pas la peine de réfléchir!"}
{"text":"Sushi très différent des autres, où nous avons fait de vraies découvertes. C'est fin, préparé devant vous si vous êtes au comptoir. Service efficace. Conseillé de réserver par contre."}
{"text":"If you read the reviews for this place, you'll discover that it's pretty polarizing. Keep that in mind when reading my review, or any others. You'll either love it, or not.  The decor... is colourful. I wouldn't describe it as \"hipster\", or cool; it's as if Eva B threw up all over Arts Cafe. I found it eye-jarring and distracting. If you can find the random boot lying on the floor, you get 20 points. One would hope that the presence of fishing gear and nets hanging from the ceiling would be reflected in the quality of the food.  Me and my date opted for Omakase 1 and 2, at which point our server (#1 of 3 that night) informed us that there was a table d'hôte not on the menu we could have for $23/person that would offer more variety. Great!  First dish is this sashimi \"salad\" mentioned elsewhere; I felt it was honestly more of a carpaccio, and the best part of the meal. Julienned green apple, salmon, fish roe, a bit on the sweet side but refreshing.  The rest of the meal was not so noteworthy, unfortunately. The theme of the rest of the evening: poor service, fish roe upon fish roe, an over-reliance on mayo, soggy tempura, and a one-note flavour of maki. The servers supplied me with her elbows in my face upon serving the first dish and had no idea what the second dish was, and had to ask the chef (it was the ever famous Christmas tree/\"tartare\"). The tell was the four poor pieces of sushi, consisting of meagre sliver of fish on over-vinagred rice.  The menu certainly serves up a lot of bells and whistles; I didn't get to experience their maki with fruit (and hope never to). Avocados, rice paper rolls (which add an unpleasant chewiness), and explosion of \"Tri ssauce \" all over the menu. But if you want quality seafood and product, where the freshness and simplicity of the ingredients are allowed to sing, get thee to a real sushi shop.  Oh yeah, cash only."}
{"text":"1. Book a reservation 2. Show up on time 3. 3 mins later you have the menu and water 4. 10 mins later you ordered  5. 15 minutes later you eat  But I could wait much longer cause it's too good.  Fast, quality seafood, clean, stylish and give a good tip.  I went multiple times and it's always good!! This is a gem on the plateau, please go!!  Small restaurant, big bathrooms :)"}
{"text":"We tried two sushi rolls and some sashimi and tartar. It was good but nothing special. The service is not very friendly and they give you a pen to pick your choices. I made a trip to this place after receiving a recommendation from a friend but I don not recommend it nor will I ever come back. The menu is also just in French and they don't have an English menu. I also thought that the fish was not very fresh. The items are expensive too for the quality."}
{"text":"Les meilleurs makis jamais mangés. Une découverte ! Copieux, frais, goûteux, bref une adresse à conseiller."}
{"text":"WOW the sushi here was AMAZING!  I am still dreaming about it.  Next time I visit Montreal, I am definitely returning to Tri Express.  Great food, great service, really nice decor.  Such a small and cute restaurant, but I would recommend a reservation since it's tiny and it was PACKED when I was there."}
{"text":"Lurking behind an unassuming exterior and an incongruous kitschy diner-like interior lies one of Montreal's best sushi restaurant. I had wandered by it numerous times thinking it was just another generic sushi take-out joint that now litter the city before finally inspecting it closer. I noted the packed crowds inside and the glowing write-ups on the door and thought it must be one of those hidden gems that only people in the neighborhood know about. Turns out I was wrong. Montreal sushi aficionados know Tri's work (Tri is the name of the sushi master chef) from two high end places he worked at before opening his own place. Considering the cramped and unglamorous interior, the place is not cheap (it probably rivals more expensive sushi restaurants in Montreal like Shodan or Maiko and a very basic dinner for two with the simplest combination plate will run about $70) but the sushi is better than any I had in the city. The fish is incredibly fresh, the presentation is beautiful, and the combination of flavors and textures are truly impressive. It's my new favorite sushi place in town."}
{"text":"Pros:  - Great filet mignon salad - Cute retro decor  Cons:  - Small - Only takes cash - Service with a shrug not a smile  Neutral:  - Decent sushi, but not amazing - No free tea *pout* - Pricey (for someone who lived in BC)"}
{"text":"My friend and I got the chef special 15 pieces The salmon was very soft and fresh, it was melting by itself in our mouths The service was good, a bit too fast even, they didn't want us to starve so every time we finished a place the next one was right in the middle of our table We didn't know that they do not sell alcohol there, so we wanted to have sake and we finished by passing our tour as we didn't went to go out and buy something 3 blocks away where the Saq is located  Here is the hint, stop at the Saq before getting in"}
{"text":"Je suis en amour avec leur sushis!!!! Aussi bon que beau, ambiance voyage relaxe et soignée. Si vous voulez le meilleur sushi de montreal ne cherchez pas plus loin il est devant vous ;)"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I figured this place was amazing. .. turns out it's  NOT! .. place is so small when you walk in your breathing all over people's food and vice versa. I had no idea who was our waitress or waiter 3 different people came to our table. First they place us in a corner and forget about us, we change places, order our food, just as there's 2 sushi left , I find a hair at the bottom of my plate.  I signal a waiter, he leaves with the plate, another waiter comes back with the plate asking us if it's our plate, he then tells us \"it's not my hair\". We answer \"its not ours either\" he then leaves and brings us more sushi. I ask for a coke, he literally gives me a can, I ask for a straw \"we have no straws\" so we ask for a glass and finally brings it. Food was ok but service was horrible. We had to ask for every single thing we wanted, no service at all. Debated between this place and Mikasa. Should have went to Mikasa instead. Definately not a returning customer."}
{"text":"Disappointing... I prefer Saint Sushi... Its more on the pricey side, and their rolls are just okay, nothing special. Ordered the chef's special and the tri roll (the one with rice paper) and they were not impressive. The sashimi with thin apple slices was really amazing tho  The decor was worth taking pictures haha"}
{"text":"J'hésite sérieusement entre 3 et 4 mais de là à en entendre TANT parler dans TOUS les articles sur \"les 10 meilleurs sushis de Montréal\" et etc... j'ai été un peu déçue du coup. Je m'attendais à encore mieux en fait ! Nous avons pris la sélection 5 plats du chef. Déjà, un peu déçus, ce ne sont pas 5 plats de sushis. On a aussi eu du poisson avec du riz et une salade (avec d'ailleurs un des 2 morceaux de poissons recouverts de mayo épicée ou équivalent, pas top). Les sushis sont bon, bien présentés. Mais je connais une place où ils sont encore meilleurs !!  Et bon, il faut le dire, mais les 2 serveurs qui nous ont servis n'étaient vraiment pas dans leur bon jour. Pas un sourire, pas une explication sur ce qu'on avait dans les assiettes, pas un mot... vraiment pas sympathiques en tout cas. Ca va qu'on était 3 amis et qu'on a passé un bon moment nous 3 ensemble :)  En tout cas, ce n'est pas là que je reviendrai la prochaine fois que je veux faire découvrir un super sushi à une amie."}
{"text":"I was very conflicted by my experience at Tri Express. I am giving it a 3 star review based upon my overall experience...I state this because the service was vastly different from the quality of the food. Firstly upon arrival we were situated next to a window in the dead of winter and had to keep our coats on lest we freeze. We then had to ask our waitress twice to clean our table because after the first request she ran a wet cloth lightly over the table and left it half cleaned and sopping wet (picture posted). The service was 2 star. The food however rated a 4 star rating. Interesting and flavourful if lacking in originality...overall worth the trip."}
{"text":"A delicious sushi restaurant with cool, artsy decor. The Plateau vibe is charming and the Maki dishes are all amazing. It is also a surprisingly affordable place for good sushi like this."}
{"text":"Tri Express is the size of a walk-in closet yet packs a ton of personality in both decor and personnel: master sushi chef Tri is friendly (haven't cleaned my hand since shaking his!) and his place is just as bright and welcoming.  And the sushi's delicious.  While this BYOB is a charming date spot, sizable parties may wish to opt for take away. Get the omakase menu to go (no joke). Everything is expertly prepared and packaged, ready to handle the trek to your flat. The sushi is marvelously fresh, the sashimi heavenly, and the flavors creative (try the rice crackers topped with seafood). Plus, there's plenty of wasabi and ginger if needed.  Bring cash."}
{"text":"This place is hands down one of my favourite sushi places in town (apart from Park). For slightly more than a all you can eat dinner fare, you can get a good quality filling tasting menu.   Unlike some of the previous reviewers, I've actually had a better experience here than at saint sushi - I found that the food was better seasoned (especially the christmas trees and the rolls). The quality of the fish was much better than the sushi buffet and the rolls were more delicately prepared and very innovative!   This place does not serve your typical sushi but if you want something out of the ordinary that is full of flavour, my suggestion is Tri-Express. The restaurant can get quite busy so make sure to call and rsvp ahead of time."}
{"text":"Menu dégustation pour 2 personnes au choix du chef (42$ pour deux).  C'est simple tout est bon et bien dosé.  Frais. Goûteux. Beaux. Original.  Endroit: petit....peut-être trop. sympathique. Services: rapide hors heure de pointe"}
{"text":"OK, this place makes GREAT sushi BUT, there were some things that made the experience less than great - first of all, it's small and ALWAYS crammed to the rafters. You will be practically sitting on someone else's lap (ever wanted to know what it's like to do a double date with a couple of complete strangers?) and reservations are a MUST. Just don't even bother going without one. If you're lucky, you'll get one of the counter seats and be able to watch the sushi-making in action, but if not, prepare to be a little awkward and uncomfortable. OH, also important to note is that THEY ONLY TAKE CASH.  For all of you Montreal Anglos like me, unless you are fluent in French, what you order will be a bit of a surprise - there is no English on the menus, not even in tiny print. I really had no idea what I was getting other than tuna and shrimp as the main ingredients. This was a wee bit frustrating and the staff was too busy to stop and explain anything to me, so I just did my best. Anyway, everything I got was pretty delicious and beautifully presented, so ultimately, *whatever*.  Another thing that went awry is that we ordered a bottle of San Pelligrino with our sushi, which just never came. Missing part of the order is a big no-no in my books. Nobody came to check on our table after we received our order either, because they're just too busy, so we just went without.   Next time, I think I'll order take-out, even though the décor is pretty exciting inside the restaurant if you like vintage ceiling clutter."}
{"text":"J'aurais mis 3.5 mais je souhaiterais y retourner et manger dedans pour me refaire une idée car là on a pris à emporter. On a attendu 30 minutes pour la commande et on l'a mangé au Parc Laurier.  Il y a des sushis/makis vraiment originaux et qui changent des classiques que l'on retrouve un peu partout. Il y en a pour tous les gouts, différents type de poisson et certains épicés. C'est bon mais je pense que mon opinion a été biaisé par le fait de le manger dans le parc sans le \"confort\" d'un restaurant.  Je ferais une MAJ quand on y retournera et qu'on mangera sur place.  A restester :)"}
{"text":"Cheap on the meat & bad service  Although the presentation was decent, the amount of fish in every dish was very disappointing. Even worse, it looks like they're trying to hide this through more starch in the tartare, and rice in the sushis.  The waitress was also very rude and impatient.  Will not go there again."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall type resto - small seating, cozy environment and amazing food!   The chef/owner is always behind the counter orchestrating everything! He has his eye on every table ensuring everyone is having a pleasant time.  I love this restaurant because he has his own creations and he serves them well. Presentation is beautiful. Seating is a bit cramped, but it adds to the experience.   This is a resto you should take your friends or relatives that are coming out of town to. Especially if they like sushi. It was surely impress.  Note: my partner doesn't eat fish at all. There was one filet mignon item on the menu and it got his seal of approval  i guess that says alot! Thank you chef tri!  Ps: make a reservation on Friday and Saturday or else you'll be stuck waiting in line!  Ps2: posted english menu pictures!"}
{"text":"Three of us tried the $25 tasting menu. It was a good price but nothing was like WOW. It seemed like this place have a lot of deliveries as the waiters were pretty busy most of the time. This is definitely a good sushi place for delivery standard, but maybe not worth the effort to go in and sit down for their food.  This place does not offer authentic sushi. They put avocado in every roll, which I don't like at all.  Their new style sashimi was good, creatively topped with some apple added some unique flavour. But everything else was just so so."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Montreal? The rice tasted like dishwashing soap, perhaps the chef forgot to rinse his hands. I wanted to say something however my buddy who lives 2 houses down from this place is a regular here. He was making excuses so I let it go because they take good care of him. I'm fortunate to know a bit about sushi because i'm good friend's with a Japanese chef who has taught me alot. Maki rolls stuffed with crunchy tempura is not sushi. The other thing that bothered me about this place is how they don't accept anything other than CASH. Not impressed!"}
{"text":"Excellent!  Je ne sais pas si ce sont les meilleurs sushis de Montréal, mais une chose est sûre, ce sont les meilleurs du plateau Mont-Royal, et de loin.   Les sushis sont délicieux, créatifs et originaux.  N'ayez pas peur d'essayer les spécialités, elles vous surprendront par leur audace.   Certains combos ne sont pas sur le menu, alors si vous y allez pour la première fois, informez-vous auprès du personnel pour un menu dégustation. Nous étions deux, et on nous a offert un 4 services de dégustation des spécialités pour 50$ + taxes et service, et ça valait largement le coup!  À noter: pas d'alcool, et paiement comptant seulent.  Bémol: C'est plein, plein, archi-plein, et tassé.  Pas un endroit où on va pour l'intimité....  Possibilité de réserver par téléphone."}
{"text":"Une merveille ce restaurant!!  Le meilleur Japonais de ma vie!! J'en raffole. Prenez le menu dégustation avec le homard c'est juste parfais!!! Un +++++++"}
{"text":"Tri Expresse est LA meilleure place à sushi sur le Platô, sinon, dans l'ensemble de Montréal. Point final. La cuisine est vraiment japonaise, préparée par du personnel vraiment japonais.   Voici les points négatifs qui, à mon avis, font perdre une étoile : l'endroit est victime de sa popularité. L'intérieur du resto est si petit qu'il devient trop vite bondé. Lorsqu'on mange sur place, on a l'impression d'être entassé les uns sur les autres alors que les serveurs courent un peu partout pour tenter de répondre à la demande. Le service parfois \" garoché \". Donc, évitez pour une soirée romantique. Attendez-vous à un délai variant de 45 minutes à 1 heures pour les commandes à apporter, même les soirs de semaine. Pas de payement direct ou de carte de crédit. Chez Tri, c'est cash only. Pas d'alcool, encore moins de Sapporo ou de Saké. Triste pour un resto japonais, non ?   Ceci étant dit, Tri reste un excellent comptoir à sushi. Je vous recommande particulièrement tous les sushis \" à la tri \". Lors de votre prochaine visite, prenez quelques temps pour admirer la diversité du décor baroque de l'endroit. C'est absolument charmant."}
{"text":"Great sushi for the price. We always go for the tasting menu and leave full with our pockets still heavy with cash. I must \"tri\"."}
{"text":"very tasty fish  we were there on a sunday and were one of two peoples there. everyone else was takeout. we must have seen 10 or so takeout orders leave while there.  the sushi was great. the spicy tuna and the toro sashimi were excellent.  the filet special on rice was not so great. it was overcooked and outside of the off ginger sauce it was flavorless. not sure why there are 4 dollar signs here for 60 bucks we ate to our sushi hearts desire.  Didn't try any other sushi while in Montreal so I can't say it was the best but it is definitely a solid choice if you are looking for good quality fishes!"}
{"text":"À essayer, très bons sushi et le sushi pizza!! miam  Je vous conseille le choix du chef, c'est lui qui choisira vos sushis mais le special vaut la peine.   Endroit un peut petit, mais l'ambiance est très amicale."}
{"text":"Just delicious! The omakase was nice, but there is an amazing dish of sashimi. There was nothing I was not satisfied with. I dare say it is among my top sushi restaurants that I have visited in my life. This place is cash only, and very busy -- make reservations ahead of time and bring cash  Note: there is not only no alcohol here, but it's also NOT byob."}
{"text":"Une décision prise sur le vif et hop nous voilà à deux chez Tri Express.  Arrivé sur les lieux, le décor est envoutant. Mélangeant Asie et kitsch.   Nous décidons d'y aller avec le menu du soir. Il y a trop de bonnes idées au menu alors le chef décidera.  Le repas fut délicieux. Parmi les meilleurs sushis que j'ai mangés, je crois.  Bémol, le service ne fut pas constant. On nous a déplacés pour faire place à un groupe pour nous retrouver avec un couple que nous ne connaissions pas. J'aurais préféré avoir plus d'intimité pour terminer mon assiette. J'ai senti également qu'on voulait en finir avec nous alors que nous n'étions là que depuis 45 minutes."}
{"text":"This has to be the tastiest sushi in Montreal by far.  I tried the omakase menu which is a tasting menu so we got to try a bunch of different types of sushi.   It is hard to pick a favourite kind but I think at the end of the day the salmon sashimi was the winner.  The service was pretty quick however it was difficult to get the waiter's attention when he wasn't serving us dishes.  We were a group of 6 and they didn't bring enough soy sauce for us so not everyone got some.  When we tried to flag down the waiter for more we couldn't find him.    Take note that it is cash only and a very small place so reservations are an absolute must.  In my experience they do sittings so you have to be out by a certain time for the next group of people to come in."}
{"text":"Despite us both getting a little bit \"sick\" the next day, the food was delicious.  Not sure how you rate a restaurant when that happens, but we will probably go back!  Edit:  Went back.  Delicious as always.  Waitress was nice, but probably too sick to be working."}
{"text":"Very good sushi, although a lot if contains their special sauce, so you better like that flavour profile. I do! The presentation of the dishes is great and they have a surprising variety of dishes if you are with someone who doesn't eat sushi. The decor is eclectic and very original. The service is friendly and effective."}
{"text":"Excellent repas japonais, j'ai absolument tout aimé ! Pour ne rien gacher, la place est super belle. La prochaine fois, je prendrai place au comptoir pourvoir les chefs en action."}
{"text":"It's the best sushi place in Montreal after Jun I (which is insanely expensive and a different vibe altogether).  The 5 course omakase menu is great and totally reasonably priced. The fish is always super fresh and the service is quick.  Dishes are amazingly tasty but there's a lot of mayo and tempura in most of them so if you are one of those minimalistic sushi people this might not be the best option for you.  The space is super eclectic and very casual. it's fun but not ideal if you are a) a very large person or b) looking for an intimate conversation with someone about something really serious.  The word \"express\" really describes the tone of the place. It really goes like this: in, eat, out.  It's NOT a place to sit around and chat for hours on end."}
{"text":"love it its the same quality everytime i go i find that it can also hurt since i hace been so many times and its always the same menu and sushi in mtl is always changing so gotta keep up"}
{"text":"J'adore, le décore est super. Les plats sont d'une fraîcheur et d'un goût vraiment au top. On mange rapidement, il faut réserver, il y a beaucoup de monde. Un de mes restaurent la préféré de Montreal. Je recommande grandement."}
{"text":"There's been a buzz about this restaurant for years but I've never been until today. I really liked it! It definitely has that cool \"Plateau\" vibe. Like everybody says, the place is really small and really buzzing (do take out if you are a group of more than 4). We had the chef special, which was about a selection of best sushis/dishes. The food was fresh, inventive and delicious.   Montreal doesn't have a great selection of Japanese restaurants compared to other places I've been. However, Tri is probably one of the best in the city."}
{"text":"Ahhhhh the kind of sushi that you dream about day and night... Tri Express is THE place to get the best sushi at the most affordable price!!! Do reserve in advance if you want the awesome place at the bar. Or else, you can also call to take out!  And ask for the tasting menu (not the 5 services one!), they will bring you 3 to 4 dishes at around 20-25$ per person! And it would not be your boring everyday sushishop kind of sushi! no no no no! the sushis literally melt in your mouth! The rice is slightly warm and vinegary... hmmm and the fish is of course the freshest you can get. Their tuna carpaccio is served with sliced green apples and ginger with a fresh and delicious soya sauce. It will make you like your plate! Then you have the famous sushi pizza, which is a yummy and crispy mixture of lobster, tempura, caviar with their special sauce, served in a pyramid on a rice cracker! It is a party in your mouth!!!  My oh my, not enough good things can be said about this place! The service is top notch and efficient. The food absolutely the best. But they just accept cash. Meh. Fair enough. And do finish your meal by walking a few streets down to Bo Bec for an awesome ice cream :)"}
{"text":"J'aime bcp la décoration et les lumieres et la bonne nouvelle est que le local s'est agrandi un peu :) on mange bien mais sans saké ni dessert ( pas disponibles )."}
{"text":"Ma place à sushis où je retourne à chaque fois. Ingrédients de qualité, bonne technique et quelques spécialités à ne pas manquer!"}
{"text":"Du temps où je mangeais des animaux c'etait sans compétition mon endroit préféré pour les sushis. Complètement renversant! Pour 25$ par personne en argent comptant les sushis y sont merveilleux !"}
