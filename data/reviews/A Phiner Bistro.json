{"text":"After finding A Phiner Bistro I am hard pressed to go to any other places when I am in the Cedar/Lee area.  The food is phenomenal, prices far lower then any comparable restaurant and the chef is great, talking about her food and inspiration then cooking some of the the most wonderful dishes."}
{"text":"I visited A Phiner Bistro with some friends on a recommendation from my neighbor. My friends and I have a monthly dinner club called World Tour, where we sample diffrent ethnic restaurants in the Cleveland-area. We all agreed, A Phiner Bistro was one of our best stops yet in the 2 year club. The food is all made to order, so prepared to wait a while, but it is worth it! Fantastic menu of vegetables, fish and beef with Nigerian and African influences. I had a delicious seaweed salad and okra stew with chicken. The owner was so friendly and nice. On a couple occassions, she came out to greet us and ask how the meal was. Before we left, she came out to thank us for coming and made us a sample juice (her speciality). The juice was just as incredible as our dinner. She teaches juicing classes and we are going to sign up. A Phiner Bistro is truly a gem in Cleveland and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great, authenic dining experience. Take out is available and you can call ahead, order and your food will be ready when you sit down! I look forward to going back."}
{"text":"We happened to walk past A Phiner Bistro last night after a movie at the Cedar Lee. Being unfamiliar with it, we previewed the menu which promised a fresh, natural approach with WILD (never farmed) seafood. We were completely delighted with our meal! Our server, Ali, was a pure delight, and the owner, Phiner, was charming and lovely. Being unable to decide from the many appetizer choices, I decided to make my dinner from three: the absolutely delicious smoked salmon pistachio soup, a fresh and tasty seaweed salad, and a baked crab cake with NO fillers...fresh, light, and perfectly paired with a delightful sauce. My husband thoroughly enjoyed his fresh, crisp salad with a light but delicious dressing and a caper chicken dish that came with a wide assortment of crisp-fresh veggies, and a delicious mix of wild and brown rice cooked in coconut milk. We split the dessert of the day, coconut sorbet served in a coconut half and garnished with grapes, but we will return for some of their interesting dessert offerings next time. They offer free corkage for spirits and several tables had known in advance to bring their own. The price point is a tad high for the neighborhood, but I am always willing to pay for quality, fresh food in a welcoming atmosphere...we cannot wait to return and to tell all our friends about this gem in Cleveland Heights."}
{"text":"We stopped by A Phiner Bistro on our way to another restaurant on Lee. After looking at the interesting menu, we decided to give it a try. Our server was welcoming and sat us down immediately. We both ordered a fresh juice (which was delicious) and the special appetizer of the day (baked plantains). Our waitress also brought us their grilled bread appetizer on the house. I had the Egusi Stew and my boyfriend had the Okra stew. Both were had very fresh vegetables and tasted great. 

Our overall experience was wonderful! All the food is made to order though so be sure to give yourself enough time for that. I would definitely come here again!"}
