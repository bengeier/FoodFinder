{"text":"Good local Chinese food take out. Tried the cashew chicken and the broccoli chicken. Both were very good. Looking forward to trying a few others."}
{"text":"Service was fast on all visits and the food is generally decent but seems cooked just a little too long.  Having had general tsos shrimp and chicken on multiple occasions this is a recurring theme.  Egg rolls are awesome, sauce is good, will try again sometime for a last chance."}
{"text":"Rice King is not bad. Rice King however is not good either. The food is very average at best buy it gets the job done and isn't very expensive. The only bad thing I can say is that when I came in to pick up our order the gentleman who was cooking came over handled the money and went back to handling the food."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a delicious meal tonight from The Rice King. We ordered the lo mein with vegetables, Szechuan chicken and egg rolls and loved all of it! The owners are so sweet and make excellent, fresh food!"}
{"text":"Chik n broccoli was fantastic. Veggie egg roll was the BEST!!!  We will be bak. FOOD IS GREAT !!!!  I'm so mad that I drove by this place for years and never stopped in."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I am easily grossed out by gooey or soggy chinese food. I have had take out from here 10+ times over the past two years. It is ALWAYS cooked well and consistently flavored. The fried rice is better than most fancy chinese places that I have been. I always order the chicken and broccoli. My only complaint is that the meals come with steamed rice and instead of an upgrade to fried rice you have to buy a container of it. 

The broccoli is always very crunchy and fresh and the chicken is cut thin and flavorful. The brown sauce is not thick, which I like. The serving size is massive and I always get at least two meals out of my order. The price is pretty reasonable considering the portion sizes and quality. We ordered my meal, my bfs general tsos, fried rice, and 2 egg rolls for $25. If you can get past the hole in the wall appearance, this is the place to get takeout!"}
{"text":"Our go to place for quick chinese. Food is awesome and fast. There is no place to sit. It's just take out. Everything I've ordered here is good. My favorites and chicken in garlic sauce and general tsos. Hot and sour soup is great too."}
{"text":"This is our never fail go-to place for Chinese food. The couple who run the place seem a little gruff at first but they are really very nice folks who work super hard. The food is great. I've never- literally NEVER- had food from there that didn't live up to expectations. My personal favorite is the orange beef, my husband prefers the sesame chicken. (extra spicy.) It's take-out only, no seating other than a small waiting area, and no delivery. It's fast and SO yummy."}
{"text":"This is easily the best Chinese food I've had in Pittsburgh. Small little place next to a liquor store and chiropractor, but it is so awesome. Husband and wife team that always seem like they're fighting with each other when you go in there and it's kind of amusing. Their food is great though. Vegetables are super fresh and crisp. We've had the General Tso's, fried dumplings, and we always get Chicken and Broccoli. Their Chicken Fried Rice is amazing too. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've been going to Rice King for years now.  As others have said, the food is excellent especially considering the prices.  My favorite is the Hunan beef but I've also had the General Tso's Chicken, Fried rice, egg rolls and fried dumplings all much better than the local places near my work in Oakland.  It is a small operation run by a husband and wife team.  I would highly recommend them.  Take note that this place is striclty take out."}
{"text":"I'm changing my 4 star rating to a one.  I got the sweet and sour shrimp and it was the equivalent of eating paper mâché while it's still wet.  It was all not cooked thoroughly and the shrimp in the middle was soggy.  I'm posting a picture of all the raw breading.  Disgusting!!"}
{"text":"We love their food, my wife orders there quite often I love it we always ask for extra extra hot spicy that his brings out the flavor never had a bad meal there yet in the last 10 years great people"}
{"text":"this place has consistently been going downhill since 2009, i just cant get them to package the Tsos sauce in a way that wont spill all over, they wont put it in the dish so you are left with trying to eact general tsos without sauce and it of course sucks that way. grumpy owners, never say thank you wtf."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this place numerous times. Don't get me wrong the food always tastes good but how it's prepared is just ridiculous! 
I got steamed dumplings and I swear it was like I ate a dough ball with little meat. I had to throw most of them away.
I got shrimp with snow peas and barely had any shrimp but a crap ton of chess nuts which I'm not a big fan of. 
Then every time I order a shrimp roll the proportion of the rooms are inconsistent. Last one I ordered was small other times they were big. 
Also I go an order of Crispy shrimp which the shrimp were coated with a ton a dough again."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened to Rice King. For a long time the food was great.  But in the last year it has really gone down hill."}
{"text":"Some of the best Chinese food in Pittsburgh. I love their rice, orange chicken, crab wontons, and lo mein. Everything I've ever had was spectacular. Their prices are cheap and the portions are huge. They always hook us up with extra fortune cookies."}
{"text":"We took a chance on this little hole in the wall joint!!! Great food at great prices....I just wish the owners were more friendlier, they always give us a hard time when we ask for chop sticks! Then she hands us 1 for 2 entrees and apps! Makes no sense"}
{"text":"This is so sad... I went for the first time today, and I REALLY wanted to like this place. The couple working there were very nice, the inside was sparse and clean, with a few lovely potted plants, all great! Then I actually tasted the food and I was so disappointed. I ordered crab Rangoon (they call it cheese crab wonton or something like that) and they were over cooked and hard and had very little stuffing, and what was there was kind of separated into an oil and yellowy blobs. I've eaten a lot of crab Rangoon and never had it separated that way. I ordered steamed dumplings, and the dough on the dumplings was probably five times as thick as anywhere else, leading to an impossibly sticky dumpling that I actually choked on at one point trying to swallow, which makes saying that they were too large and misshapen seem almost inconsequential. I ordered chicken and broccoli, but I got beef (I think?) and broccoli. The sauce was very bland, there were almost no spices. I also ordered house special lo mein but I couldn't even bring myself to look at it yet. None of the ingredients seemed fresh, there were obvious kind of dead spots in the broccoli. I don't really understand what went wrong here, but I won't be giving it another go. Even the pre-packed fortune cookies were terrible, they taste like cardboard! I don't understand how the place has a four star review. :("}
