{"text":"Rolling down Route 42, Pearl Road, into Brunswick, it can be very easy, in the blink of an eye, to miss a gem of a restaurant - Bianca's Italian Restaurant.  Located on Beverly Hills Drive just past Mapleside Farms may be one of the best kept secrets in the area.
I headed out on a Friday night, ostensibly, to see \"The Poptarts,\" a local singing group that specializes in the girl group sounds of the 1960s.  They have made Bianca's a regular monthly gig.   While I hadn't decided on whether it would be a dining option as well, some research on the establishment was needed.  As a regular contributor to the Urbanspoon and Yelp websites, the information and ratings there have been influential in making choices.  And the lack of information on Bianca's did not seem to reveal extensive commentary by area diners.  The same level was always found on the Facebook page.  Lots of \"likes\" but few remarks.
Plans were made and a table reservation procured (via Facebook).  Upon arriving at the restaurant, the parking lot confirmed the need for a reservation.  My first thought was that the Poptarts must have a sizeable following.  And while that may be true, it became obvious from discussions with the patrons, it wasn't the only reason for the restaurant's popularity.
It was a sell out crowd and we were fortunate to get a bar setting as other late arriving diners were advised that the wait could be considerable.
We were greeted by Diane Amato, the owner's daughter, with whom I had chatted on Facebook about getting a reservation.  I promptly expressed my needs for dinner and she assured me I wouldn't be disappointed.
Now I readily admit that the search for good, authentic Italian food is risky sometimes.  It has been the subject of a number of my reviews.  I can be very fussy and opinionated about it.  I lived in Naples, Italy for a number of years and have been able to recreate a number of the recipes myself.  So if I am dining out, it had better be better than what I do at home.
My dining companion and I decided to play it safe.  The crowd was thick and even top kitchens can have bad nights when overwhelmed.
The bartender, Brenda, took our order.  Just want to see how well they do the basics - give me the house and the meat sauce over pasta with sides of the meat balls and sausage.  (All items that are advertised as made fresh daily.)  Refreshing to find a restaurant employee who knows what I want when the term \"al dente\" is used, too.
We received our wine orders and a bread basket.  Not sure of the vintage but the merlot and white wines served were smooth and enjoyable.  The bread, though perhaps not made on premise, was fresh and served with two kinds of flavored butters.
While waiting for our dinners, we had a chance to talk with the owner, Debbie Amato, who has been associated with the site for nigh on 25 years as a bartender for 9 years and then owner for the past 16.  We sparred a bit about the impact of social networking and modern technology - a result of my on line conversation with her daughter, Debbie, who readily uses it.  (Mom doesn't care for it and would rather manage things the conventional way.)  Digital inclinations aside, Debbie knows her cuisine.  Drawing on her Sicilian heritage, (and yes, if you know Italy, there is a difference), the attention given to our selections, was immediately evident.  I have been in too many places where the dish could easily be described as ketchup on mushy noodles.  Bianca's sauce stands up and salutes - a rich, thick mixture adorned with fresh basil on pasta cooked to perfection.  And the meatballs were moist and large.  No commercial precooked golf balls here.  A
 sweet Italian sausage with fennel seed completed the package. At around $13 to $15 a plate, the portion was well valued.
Looking over the room, I could see that other diners were fully satisfied.  The aromatic smells of a fresh scallop dish next to me sealed the decision for a return visit for something more complex - the veal I am told comes highly recommended.
In this information age, I am a proponent of \"googling it\" to find the intelligence data in making an informed choice.  It is not the only method to finding a treasure and sometimes you take a chance. Though Bianca's digital signature may not be huge, its clientele may not vocal on line, but maybe that's an \"omerta.\"  (Fans of Mario Puzo will know what it means.)  Let's just say it's unfortunate if you haven't been here.  You've missed something."}
{"text":"Per your \"compliment\", I would like to clarify some things. First we will start with the business (Cindy J) reply:

\"Those tables that were open in the front room were all reserved.. A 15-20 minute wait for a table on a Friday night without reservations.. isn't to unreasonable.. The back room was full. So it wasn't possible to seat you at that time... I'm sore you were so disappointed and had to leave a very poor review...\"

Given your probable years in the service industry, one would hope that you could say sorry with some conviction. I'm sure you're not used to providing good service given you are likely the only Italian restaurant with twenty miles. In case you wondering, pleasing the customer is part of your business. Rudeness is never called for. We were treated rudely from the time we walked in. You treated us as if we were an imposition (i.e. ushering us out of the way so that the band could set up their equipment and you could make sure the linens were freshly pressed on the empty tables). Perhaps your empty parking lot on a Friday night had something to do with your lack of business. 

Sincerely, 
Two less customers"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time after driving by a bunch and being interested. Place was clean and tastefully done up, all the wait and floor staff were shoddily dressed with old polo shirts. Prices seemed high for a home in the wall in Brunswick, but what the hell. The service though, was terrible. We walked in at 6 and were seated and given waters, the place wasn't half full. Fifteen minutes later, our waitress finally arrived and we ordered - she seemed annoyed at our order, not sure what that was about. Ten minutes later, our appetizer arrived and it was pretty good. After that we waited another 25 with nothing to show for it - our waitress didn't check on us once, there was no indication that our food was coming or that we weren't forgotten about. We decided to leave, and my family went to the car while I headed to the bar to settle our check for what we had eaten. The floor manager talked to me about my experience and I explained how we'd been waiting a long time and didn't have all night. The whole conversation, our waitress was behind the manager flailing her arms incredulously. When I stated how long we had been there, neither believed it, and I was able to show a receipt from Corbo's across the street with the time stamp. Then their excuse changed to \"well we're not fast food\". No, I didn't expect fast food, I expect to not be forgotten about, especially if your restaurant charges $30/plate prices. If you're going to charge high end prices, you got to bring high end service."}
{"text":"We ate here recently on a week night to try a Groupon.com deal of $40 of food for $20 offer.   At 8:30 at night we were the only ones in the dinning room.  I ordered a Sam Adams Summer Lager as this was one of three draft beers, however, the server stated the keg had apparently just run dry and did not have another .. really? ..   We could smell the strong nasty bathroom smell at our table drifting from the restrooms about 20 feet away.   It was no shocker that the men's room was disgusting inside.   The urinal reeked and the floor was super sticky and dirty.    I went on to order the chicken picatta.  At first glance it looked delicious, however, the real surprise came after a few bites.  The inside was dark pink and chewy.  Now I know why the lighting was dim.   Extremely under cooked to say the least.. a definite no no for chicken as I used to cook in my younger years.   The server came over and apologized when it was  brought to her attention and quickly offered to remake the dinner.   Sorry.  appetite was void at this point.  So she took the picatta only off the bill.   I was still charged for the side salad and charged for cheese on that salad.   (yes a side dinner salad is extra here.... to be expected downtown in a high end  restaurant, but here??)    As a result our bill came to $34 (because the raw gross chicken was taken off) but I could not use the $40 group-on voucher to pay the tab.  I even said Ill take the hit on the lost $6 but it could not be done.  I could feel my stomach preparing to thank me at this point for the \"fresh\" chicken it was trying to digest.    A manger never came over to the table either.  Was there even one here?    Luckily I was at home quickly after leaving Bianca's to use my nice clean non-sticky bathroom  that I spent considerable time in .. couldn't be the raw chicken , now could it!     My advice.. stay far and clear of Bianca's.   Your intestines will thank you later!"}
{"text":"Simply said, Bianca's Restorant√© sucks! Horrible food, rude service and high priced!"}
{"text":"Since moving back from Chicago this is by far my favorite restaurant... The service is incredible the staff goes out of the way to really make your dining experience AMAZING and the FOOD...  ORGASMIC!!!"}
{"text":"Web site states they are open.  Drive 50 minutes for a nice lunch on a Saturday with my son whom is home from college. Just told we are not open on Saturday in the winter.  Will never make That drive again.  Good friends gave it good reviews. Guess I will never know."}
{"text":"The service was good but overall food in terms of authentic Italian was left wanting...
Antipasti was average at best and the mains were just ok.  I would not recommend and will not be going back."}
{"text":"Our party of four had an excellent dinner at Bianca's tonight, and also enjoyed the live music (The PopTarts).  Prices were reasonable, food was great, our server Ren√®e was attentive.  Good value and enjoyable dining experience.  The restaurant doesn't stand out (just off of Rt 42/Pearl Rd, entrance on Beverly Hills Dr.), but it's worth finding."}
{"text":"This is seriously working it's way up to five star status.  
I've been craving Italian food and although it's quite a popular cuisine, I have yet to find a reliable, reasonably priced italian joint.  I was so happy when I found Bianca's.  We almost didn't go based on the horrible presentation on their website.  Thank God the food looks much better in person and is absolutely delicious.  
I like this place particularly because it had a fancy look to it, but we also didn't feel out of place in sweatshirts and jeans.  
I ordered the baked ziti and my date ordered the chicken parm.  
Love it."}
{"text":"this used to be our favorite place to eat. A few years back they decided to raise prices AND start charging for the salads instead of including them with the dinners, they also seemed to have reduced portion sizing.  Service has always been good though, same servers have been there for a long time. Steak romano is my favorite, as well as their alfredo dishes. Like that the owner and her daughter always seem to be there, very hands on. Once saw the owner treating a server very bad, take that stuff in the back, don't do it right in the dining area. I recommend that the owner go to Italian Village and see how they are doing it, it is now our favorite place, great portions, prices, and great food.

Went back again last night, what a mistake. There was a private party in the other room which basically shut down all food service for the rest of the place, the servers were apologizing to everyone about the wait. My husband got the eggplant parm., three tiny pieces with a side of spaghetti with what tasted like ragu sauce on it, if it wasn't for the salad which we purchased separately he would have left hungry. One word for the women's restroom, gross. In fact, the whole place feels dirty and sad. I expect they won't be around much longer."}
{"text":"Good food, great crowd, and the prices are decent. I love sitting at the bar and having cocktails."}
{"text":"Our party of 6 had dinner there last night. We had a blast. The food was excellent not a complaint from any one. Well just one...salad not included with meal. I can't tell you how much fun we had with our server Denise busting her chops about this. Denise is the owners daughter and so much fun. I can't wait to go back again. Denise's mom came over to the table and the chef even came out to meet us. I had the veal marsala...omg the best I ever had. The other 5loved their food as well just don't remember what everyone else had. After eating here you will never eat at a Carrabba's or Olive garden again!!!!  Just loved the whole experience. More importantly my veal!! Hats off to you all guys. Job very well done.  Oh yeah,  we were the Tischler party."}
{"text":"My wife and I come here for date night often.  We love both the specials and the regular menu.  Chicken piccata is great and a good wine list."}
{"text":"Started out with a very rude greeter and went downhill from there.  We would have liked to see how the food was but we saw our waitress once in 40 minutes. The 4 of us ordered drinks but no bitters because they forgot to go to the store? Ordered different drinks and a beer - got the drinks finally but didn't have the beer.  Ordered another beer, on tap, - waited another 10 mins watching the bartender on her cellphone. Threw a 20 on the table only because another waitress took pity on us and was trying very hard to put a positive face on everything... walked out and won' be back."}
{"text":"1/25/17 Update - I previously wrote a review criticizing the owner on how they handle feedback and how they handle Groupon customers. I was initially sent a reply accusing me of making up my experience which prompted me to complain on their Facebook page. Upon arriving on their Facebook page, I noticed several other reviewers complaining about similar behavior.

After I left a negative review on their Facebook page, they blocked me completely from their page which they have completely denied. The owner also started messaging me through private messages and had family/friends harass me as well, trying to guilt trip me into removing the review.

The owner resorted to sketchy behavior and reported my review to Facebook to get it removed after I refused to. This is a major red flag as you don't know how inflated their current review score is based on them trying to remove negative reviews.

Overall, I stand by my judgement on telling future customers to stay away. The owner has constantly shown bad judgement with treating customers poorly, getting upset/angry when they get any negative criticism, and promoting bad business practices by censoring negative reviews."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Bianca's several times. The food is good. The prices are a little high and the restaurant floor and restroom are usually very dirty. For me, a dirty restaurant is a deal breaker. So for me, it earns 2 stars. I would return if they \"cleaned up\" their act."}
{"text":"I had been to Bianca's several times and always enjoyed it.  The service was a little lacking, but not unbearable.  I took some out of town people there for a good Italian dinner and the Pop Tarts last evening and was totally embarrassed.

First, reservations were made two weeks ago.  Our table was at the stage, making us part of the show.  The set up man was crawling around under our table.

It took 25 minutes before a waitress came by.  We asked for menus and ordered drinks.  She returned ten minutes later to advise me they were out of bitters.  Whaat?  They were also out of the beer another person ordered.  He requested a beer list.   Well they used to have ONE but something happened to it.  One?  Waitress did not return with his other choice.  After fifteen minutes, threw a $20 on the table and left.

I will never go back there."}
{"text":"Live this restaurant. The food is delicious. I recommend the chicken Marsala, the risotto is to die for.  My son recommends the pizza, my daughters favorite is the G's lasagna and my husband loves the fresh fish. Service is always attentive and friendly"}
{"text":"First and last time I visited here. I was also a Groupon customer which I saw a few complaints of below. First they tried not accepting my Groupon saying they couldn't accept that form of payment? Anyways I have never in my life tasted bad chicken alfredo until here. Absolutely horrible and my Mom ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. Can honestly say Chef Boy R D is 100% better. Would never waste my time or money at this sad excuse of a \"fine dining\" restaurant again."}
{"text":"I find this cute little Italian Bistro by chance after leaving exhausted from an evening at Mapleside Farms enjoying family fall activities. This little restaurant is across the street from Mapleside, so it was perfect. We walked up to an adorable patio with gorgeous hibiscus flowers. It was close to closing time, but the staff said that they were still open. The inside was so cute and cozy and we got our beverages, salads and bread right away. Our main entrees arrived and the Fettucine Alfredo and the meat sauce in their baked ziti was honestly the best I have ever had. Friendly staff and a warm atmosphere. I do not live in the area, but will plan on going back whenever I am down that way."}
{"text":"The food was bad.  They were out of walleye ($22) so they recommended halibut.
It tasted like it was in the freezer for a year.  The broccoli was raw, not steamed.  The waitress (owner's daughter) was rude and condescending.  When I mentioned how bad the fish
was she said everyone loves it.  How can everyone love it when it's NOT on the menu to
order???  She did not tell the manager because she probably thinks she's the boss of the
place.  When she gave me the bill for $32.00 I said $32.00 for a small piece of bad fish???
She said  ...\"That's right\" in a snotty attitude.  I didn't think to ask what the price was because
the price of the fish (walleye) on the menu was $22.00 and because they were out of the walleye, they SUBSTITUTED  the halibut.  Should have been the same price, right?  No,
they charged $32.00, not telling me from the start of the price difference.  I would not have
paid 50 cents for that awful fish.  (I know what good fish tastes like from eating it in 
Cape Cod for the past 20 years AND even the Red Lobster)  There is nothing wrong with
my taste buds either.  I will never go to Bianca's again."}
{"text":"I agree with Teejay B.  Place nice & clean. Servers were very friendly. My husband & I were looking forward to their great veal dishes but was very disappointed! My veal was well overly done & my husband order their day special but the waitress fail to explain that the dish had eggplant on it! My husband does not like eggplant & wouldn't of not order it! Our expansive $13.00 crab cake was cold in the middle. It was to late to have it return for a warm up. For a Friday night (6 pm) they're out of many things including their famous dessert!"}
{"text":"OMG!!!! This food was fantastic! You would never know it from the outside or even after stepping inside the door. This is a small private owner place. I had the lasagna and although the portion was gigantic you will eat the whole thing! My husband had the special which was short ribs and they were to die for! You have to try this place!!"}
{"text":"This was my 3rd time at Bianca's. I've been there for father's day and a girls night out and both times were great. Father's day they had a band playing (The Poptarts) and the place was packed. My girls night out was laid back and relaxing. So when it was my grandma's birthday i suggested we go to Bianca's for her birthday dinner. I bought a Groupon for $28 worth of $80 of food. I should of known right there why they were on Groupon. It was Friday July 3 and we all sat down and got our waters.. the only time they poured our waters. Our server seemed like she was in a hurry and wanted to rush us the whole time. We finally went to order and they were out of steak... how are you out of steak on a Friday night.. also the most expensive dish on the menu? She said it was because of the holiday weekend. So i ordered a meatball with my pasta but they only had 1 meatball left. This is an Italian place.. how do you have only 1 meatball? My boyfriend ordered chicken parm and asked for cavatellis instead of fettuccine. instead she brought out both fettuccine and cavatellis as well as never refilling his water. She never introduced herself and if she would have it would of been nice to tell us what she was out of before looking at the menu for 15mins and then have to re-look. The food was good the service was terrible.. and they were out of some main dishes. They didn't even have the fresh Parmesan cheese for our pasta so she just brought us a bowl full of the sprinkle kind. Disappointed and was embarrassed to take my Grandma there for her birthday. Won't be back after that experience."}
{"text":"This was the first time ever trying Bianca's and it won't be the last.  My husband and I both started with the French onion soup.  Had to be the best French onion soup I've ever had.  For our meals I had the veal parmesan and he had the chicken Marsala.  Both meals were excellent and service was quick & friendly.  Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Just because you're out in the suburbs shouldn't mean you should lower your expectations.  Well, I say that in theory, maybe not to be applied to Bianca's.  

Bianca's decor is exactly what you'd expect.  It's very Italian-American aunt decor with lots of fake flowers strewn about gold framed pictures.  The 90's black chairs kind of make me laugh though.

In regards the service, it was honestly fine despite all of the reviews I'd seen stating the opposite.  Our server was prompt and sure, I can be nitpicky that I had to get up and look at the specials and he never lit our candle, overall he was around when I needed him.

We ordered the calamari which, to me, tasted like it was bought in bulk at CostCo.  It had a thick breading which detracted from whatever little morsels of calamari there actually were in there.  

Our Fettuccine dishes were about as average as could be.  The sauce wasn't anything special and not nearly as rich as I'd been expecting.  The shrimp fettuccine also had their little tails still on so I had to get my hands alfredo'ey and pick them up to tear off their tails.  Gross!!  Huge pet peeve for me, it's not hard to take off the tails before you put them in a sauce!!

Overall, I'll not be returning."}
{"text":"Food so-so...server not trained AT ALL. Forgot salad, long wait for one entree, passing plates instead of serving. It was a birthday dinner, which we told her when we arrived, but she did nothing and didn't offer anything either."}
