{"text":"(Really 3.5 stars.) My husband and I thought we would try this place - keep in mind that we have just moved from Dallas, TX where Tex-Mex reigns supreme. A little unfair of a comparison? Probabl, but oh well. I got a house margaritas on the rocks - too much citrus in the margarita. Needs to be balanced out with a little bit of sweetness. I also got the Mahi Mahi tacos - not bad but not great. Decor was a little over the top in it's Mexican spirited-ness. They do have a great beer selection, which may bring us back again. They also have featured breweries and beer specials every 5 weeks or so - this week was Brooklyn Brewery, a personal favorite."}
{"text":"Noisy, fun, nice wait staff. Food is just okay. Black beans seem to be flavored with curry?  This place (during meal times) is JAMMED. A local favorite, but for Mexican food...it is just okay."}
{"text":"Sure, funky warm colors, fresh air, and great location--but not Mexican food.  Definitely a disappointment!  Someone please open a taqueria on the East End!  Service was mediocre."}
{"text":"To me, Mad Mex is a place to watch sports, drink beer and eat wings!  And for those points and those points only, I am giving Mad Mex 4 stars!  

It's convenient, there's street parking, it's a fun atmosphere, it's not impossible to get a table, and they have a decent happy hour!  What is there to complain about??

I can't speak to the food because I basically refuse to eat mexican food outside of CA or Texas.  (And yes, I know that Tex-Mex is fake mexican food.)  So, I'll defer to the rest of the yelpers for opinions on the food.  But given that there are several locations, I'm sure the food is your run-of-the-mill chain mexican options."}
{"text":"I love this place, wish the food was a little cheaper like other Mexican restaurants!"}
{"text":"Coming from the Midwest, I'm used to mediocre Mexican. I actually like mediocre Mexican, itself a style of food. But Mad Mex is sub-par Mexican - quite bad, actually. If this is the best Mexican Pittsburgh has to offer (as the readers of Pittsburgh Magazine suggest), then the 'Burgh has some work to do. The house salsa (extra charge) is a lousy blend of tomatoes and tomatoes. Entrees were just plain bad. Again, the consistently high ratings for this place mystify me. Have you had good (or even mediocre) Mexican before, Pittsburgh? The silver lining here was attentive service, despite a busy and obnoxiously loud dining room."}
{"text":"I am not sure what has happened, but the quality of the food has completely deteriorated in the last 3 months. My partner ordered the tortilla soup and got the chick pea chilli which was cold to boot. The tortilla soup which followed was also cold. The fried fish tacos which I ordered last night were completely inedible- the fish was soggy and did not taste like fish, but rather some kind of tofu. The black beans were dried out. We really enjoyed going to Mad Mex for the vibe, the drinks and the delicious food, but will not return any time soon. What is going on?"}
{"text":"Love madmex. Foods great. Fun place!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and it's been consistently good, except for the barbacoa tacos. They were so salty I couldn't eat them. The bartenders are cool and very attentive. It's not hardcore Mexican, but it does the trick."}
{"text":"Really solid place. Great beer selection and specials and consistently good food. 
Check out happy hour! Have gluten free, veggie, and vegan options. Fun for the whole family!!!"}
{"text":"The best meal we had in 4 days in Pittsburgh ! Went on Friday night, had about a 25 minute wait but man was it worth it ! Appetizers were the Southwestern wings which were incredible and the trio of dips which we couldn't stop eating! Main courses were the Mad Mex burrito with shrimp and chicken enchiladas, Fantastic !!  Excellent service too ! Will definitely be going back when we come back."}
{"text":"Ugh, not only was the food cold and too salty and greasy, but I then got food poisoning that night.  Never going here again.  Worst restaurant in Shadyside."}
{"text":"Matt was a great bar tender. The wings with The San Francisco sauce were amazing and the strawberry margarita was great."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss. Ordered the mad mex chicken burrito. The rice was under cooked, the burrito tasted dry and there was barely any chicken inside the \"chicken\" burrito. It's almost as if you have to order double chicken for there to actually be any chicken in the burrito. What's the point?"}
{"text":"Gobblerito tastes nothing like Mexican food, and it satisfied every need I never knew I had or wanted, cranberry margarita was delicious, boozeyband not too sweet. Perfect! Cute ambiance, otherwise standard white people Tex mex. I see myself visiting this place a lot more in the future."}
{"text":"Good food, great drinks and great service. Visiting from outa town and was craving Mexican food.  Tried this place out first time. Was seated quickly, service was great. (Only one waitress covering our area but she was very attentive.) The margarita menu is extensive and has something for everybody. We tried the carnitas tacos and they were great. I'd go-to this place again..."}
{"text":"I don't know their names, but the two bartenders (one male, one female) typically working at night are some of the best I have encountered.  Cheers to them for consistently good service."}
{"text":"Terrible, pathetic service! Food it good though. It took three tries to get the guacamole that I ordered, my frozen margarita tasted like lime mixed with frozen orange juice concentrate. The replacement tastes like it has a 1/2shot in a 22oz drink. Our chips never showed up and our waitress only asked us how we were doing after we had to speak to the manager. This was close to the worst service I've ever had at a restaurant. If the food wasn't so good I would have never though to come back.. Never got napkins, never got water, never got Chips, never got a buzz. But the manager assured me there was alcohol in there because they batch make it the mixes in the morning...whatever that means.


If you are willing to sacrifice service for a chance at good food, check out this location."}
{"text":"Fish tacos were amazing! And great beer selection - especially great prices on unique beer list for Happy Hour! Definitely recommend this place. I'm going back for sure."}
{"text":"Mad Mex has the best happy hour in Pittsburgh if you're a beer drinker. The Shadyside location boasts 20+ taps of high quality brews, all of which are half price from 4:30-6:30. While l I find the restaurant's proudly inauthentic Mexican-ish fare rather mediocre (carnitas burrito/enchilada and mahi salad are bright spots), their wings are some of the best in town and also half off during happy hour.

In addition to their excellent happy hour, Mad Mex frequently runs other generous specials and will send you a voucher for a free burrito on your birthday if you sign up for their mailing list. They also send out some nice coupons via snail mail and their e-newsletter, so you can get some great deals if you pay attention."}
{"text":"This isn't a best-restaurant-ever 5 stars, but for what it is, a fun, irreverent twist on Mexican with a great beer selection, it does exactly what it sets out to do.

The Shadyside location has short rib tacos, which are worth the trip.

There's not much to say about MM that hasn't been said already, but dang, those tacos are good."}
{"text":"This is the best Mad Mex location. 

The staff is always FRIENDLY, unlike Oakland, the food is just as good (if not better), and I don't think I've ever waited more than five minutes for a table here.

I've been here at least a dozen times since moving back to Pittsburgh, and it's now what comes to mind when I think \"Mad Mex\". I've had plenty of meetups with friends, nights out with my girlfriend, and even a small, informal High School reunion at this location, and have never been disappointed by the food or the service.

The only issue is the parking situation, which isn't Mad Mex's problem, but it's worth mentioning. The plaza up the street (which houses Chipotle, etc) used to allow it after all of the businesses closed, but now they have a group of security guards harassing people and threatening to tow cars all night, despite their empty lot. I ended up having to park about a half-mile away the other night. This was infuriating, considering the hundreds of empty spots right next to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Birthday. Gobblerito. It was so wrong yet so right. Like being with a woman you know you shouldn't be with but damn it you can spare the eventual heart break for the momentary bosom of her warm love. That, my friends, is the Gobblerito. Minus one star for awkwardly loud acoustics."}
{"text":"I thought I had counted  Mad max out as a restuarant to eat, at least at the other locations.  The Highland Ave location is awesome.  The decor is great, except a little dark in the evening.  The food, sangria's and mixed drinks are really good.  I have never had a bad meal there yet!  A little inconsistency with the southwestern sauce. My picks are the southwestern wings and talipia tacos, and totilla soup.  I wish they would change the type of rice they use, reminds of wedding rice, hard with no flavor.   Oh yeah, the barternders are the coolest."}
{"text":"I like the Shadyside location because of the seitan wings, but at least when it comes to delivery, they are NOT worth the frustration!! Super slow, late delivery turned into accidentally delivering my order to someone else, and when I opened it up and saw it was the wrong order, the restaurant had closed for the night. The driver was ridiculous rude, too. They don't deserve your business."}
{"text":"Such ridiculous service. I have never been so disrespected by a server in my life. Went with 3 colleagues to this Mad Mex at 11 PM on a Saturday for just a few appetizers & margs. After being seated our waitress asked if we wanted waters to start, to which we said yes. She had someone else bring out the waters and when she came back herself she told us that one of our guests could not be served. The girl she was referring to had only had one drink before we arrived at mad mex, just like the rest of us. She was SO RUDE about it. We were shocked. Unfortunately I have witnessed an experience like this before at Mad Mex where I have seen a sober person denied service. Even though I have connections to the Big Burrito restaurant chain, I will no longer be giving my money to their restaurants. Unfortunate."}
{"text":"I really love this place every time I go everyone is so friendly the drinks are amazing and the food is great!!! I would recommend this place for all ages and groups. Very great happy hours specials as well."}
{"text":"This was a very fun place. It had, maybe, the most diverse menu I've seen in a tex-mex place. 

I had some hybrid tacos, The guacamole was tangly and really tasty. They did a good burrito as well. 

The decor was really cool with some day of the dead type murals. A very fun environment. The front opened to let lots of fresh air, making it like eating outside. 

Our waiter was really good. Kept the sodas and water coming. The food came out promptly and was hot. 

All in all, it was a good time."}
{"text":"It's really not a Mexican restaurant so much as an Americanized version of Mexican. The burritos are OK, but often lacking a bit of flavor. The tofu in particular needs a bit of improvement."}
{"text":"For midnight snacks, Mad Mex is about as good as it gets.  This new location on Highland is spacious and doesn't make you feel like you're dining at the same table as the 12 people in your immediate vicinity.  It has all the perks of the \"traditional\" Oakland location -- interesting beers, tasty flavored margaritas, great food, fun waitstaff -- without the ridiculous waits and high temperatures.  The parking is also somewhat better, since you're not competing with the eight-to-a-house Pitt undergrads in Oakland."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of the restaurant was very nice. They played good music, however, it was extremely loud and was hard to have a conversation at the table with the music blaring. They had a very good menu with alot of options. When the food came out it looked very good. I ordered the enchiladas and may girlfriend got the fajitas burritos. The dishes were not served warm and were very bland. The enchiladas had chunks of chicken that were hard to eat. it would have been better of the meat was shredded. The fajitas burrito had large pieces of meat and the steak was very chewy. The burrito was not well mixed, the one side had cheese and rice and the other side had the meat. Overall the restaurant had a good atmosphere and presentation, but the food needs work."}
{"text":"Fuck this place showed up at 5:15 pm was quoted 30 to 45 min. Waited an hour to hear an other thirty min. I had two children and a a other couple. The hostess could give two shits she even laughed when I complained the manager avoided me like the plague. This is not a professional restaurant  which is not typical for the big burrito group. 
Don't go here if you have kids or a time frame."}
{"text":"Pretty good service and food. HOWEVER, beware of the valet service across the street. Apparently,  my son and I stayed longer than usual, so we had rto a show a receipt, and they  asked us why we were there so long. When I got to my car, I was parked next to a dumpster, and all 4 of my windows were open.  Kind of weird and passive aggressive.there was no time limit on how long we could be in the restaurant before we w ould be harassed by the \"valet service.\" I decided to put my $10 tip away and swear not to eat in that area again!"}
{"text":"Went there with friends tonight (a Wednesday), early (we thought) at 6 o'clock, and the wait was already a half-hour for tables.  We only really wanted margs and chips/guac anyway, so thought it was only fair that we go into the bar area in the middle of the restaurant for our happy hour - and by 'happy' I was shooting for 'getting to sit' and by 'hour' I mean I didn't have all night.  So we get our drinks and end up standing quite awhile behind the people sitting at the bar, as many of them save seats for their late/invisible friends. We were getting really hungry for something to nosh on and couldn't really see a way to do this when we couldn't even physically reach the bar, so we decide to try our luck hovering by the bar tables instead... low and behold, one finally opens up!!  We beat out girls who had not been waiting as long and got to it faster.  And then...lower and beholder, a waitress comes over and tells us those are NOT bar tables, they're ones you have to be seated in by the hostess.  Silly us, thinking the high up tables with barstools in the sectioned-off bar area were for bar patrons!  So, we had to get back up and wait allll over again. Ultimately the service was fine, but that the woman was not even remotely apologetic about this was weird to me.  You'd also think that 'please see host/ess for seating at this table' signs would be warranted...the two other Mad Mex's I've been to, Oakland and North Hills, both have tables in their bar area, so it's not like it was some crazy idea I came up with.  So some type of signage would've been appreciated. Alas, Big Burrito is taking over the world (I'm sure they'll be catering the UPMC hospital cafeterias soon) so it obviously does not matter what I think.

I've never had THAT much trouble getting seated, at the bar or at a table, at the Oakland location...and for my money, especially if I'm hungry, the North Hills location I've never seen have a wait. And contrary to what many people who live in the East End think -- the North Hills is REALLY not far. This just irritated the crap out of me this evening -- unless you have all the time in the world, go to Buffalo Blues. The food is just as good and you won't have to wait until your first child is born to get to sit down after a long day of work."}
{"text":"I love TexMex. I love Mad Mex. I pay for it the next day, but I always have to get the picka dippa with pineapple habanero salsa. It's amazing--sweet with a big bite. 

Also, the Pennsytucky fried tofu is fantastic, but this time of year it's all about the Gobblerito. 

It's an entire Thanskgiving dinner wrapped  into a burrito!"}
{"text":"I visited this location for the first time last Thursday, for Cinco De Mayo.  I think that this place was the first Mexican restaurant that I had been to in PIttsburgh.  First of all- it is a 4 minute walk from my new apartment in Shadyside. Score! And secondly, pretty damn good.  Super busy because of the holiday.  I don't think this place takes reservations- but we were still seated within 30 minutes of arriving- not too shabby.
Drinks were good and cheap, (because we were there during happy hour.) Food wasn't too bad either- not exactly \"authentic Mexican\" more Tex-Mex I would say- but huge portions and not too expensive, and pretty good actually.  Will definitely be back. Kudos Big Burrito!"}
{"text":"We went on a wednesday and there was a 45 minute wait at 6PM, pretty impressive even when you consider the new restaurant smell. We had a few beers each from the very impressive draft menu with chips and queso for starters. After starters we both ordered the chicken chickpea burritos, which were big and boring. All and all it wasn't my kind of place.  It was full of dudes on the prowl and blasting loud music, which made it hard to communicate with anyone. The food wasn't amazing, but it was good enough for the price, especially when you consider the portion sizes. Service was on point. The best part was definitely the beer selection, but seeing as there's a 45 minute wait on a wednesday and it's full of dude-bros, I probably won't be back anytime soon. Oh, and there's a free valet, just in case you're into that sort of thing."}
{"text":"This Mad Mex is a common stop for me. I enjoy their interesting dishes and I especially enjoy that many things (perhaps even most things) can be made either vegetarian or vegan. 

The food they serve is American Mexican food that often has interesting elements to it. It is more fresh and up-scale than the American style Mexican restaurants some of us may be used to. Also a bit more pricey, but price-wise I find it pretty reasonable. 10 to 15 or so for an entree. Drinks are fairly pricey, but not in context of the area. 

The dining area is large and crowded at times. As someone who has lived in the area my whole life, I fell in love with the oakland location of Mad Mex in high school. I was excited when this location was opening and happy for them having more and more locations. Comparatively this location is a lot bigger but slightly less endearingly funky. 

There is sidewalk seating and garage style doors in front, which are nice. Service varies, but is generally pretty good. They have student half price menu items in the early afternoons Monday through Thursday."}
{"text":"Mad Mex delivered a pretty solid experience this evening.  The host told us 35 minute wait but it only really took 15.  Impressive.  

The mixed drink was strong and well made.  There was a good selection of beers on tap and even woodchuck hard cider in a bottle.

We got the grilled fish tacos and the Thai burrito.  Both were tasty and well done.  Portions were really very large.  The appetizer of pick three salsas with chips was a good experience.  The habenero pineapple salsa was appropriately spicy and the black bean dip was great (couldn't stop eating it), the guac was excellent too I was told (I can't stand avocados).  

Friendly and efficient wait staff too."}
{"text":"Awesome location, awesome bar, the food and service were great.  Huge fan of the Mad Mex at Penn State, and this is reminding me a lot about it.  There is an amazing garage type door that opens the front to make the restaurant more of an outside area, and I've been told by several people that there may be an even larger outside area they are working on for the roof.  If someone could confirm this, that would be awesome.  

Anyway the food is great, the margaritas rock and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The food and service was pretty good and tasty.. Can get packed so call in to make a reservation..Only turn off was the music inside was played to loud! And it so noisy for my liking. I thought I was in a club, we had to shout to hear one another."}
{"text":"Been here many times. Nice staff, above average food--but tonight, no soap in the men's room, even after 45 minutes letting staff know! Probably 100 people in the house with a dozen or more severs--and no soap? People!"}
{"text":"As far as TexMex establishments in Pittsburgh go this one is probably on tops.  I appreciate that they have a significant craft beer line up which goes far beyond the window dressing list a lot of places that try to carry craft beer put out.  Today I am drinking Founder's Kentucky Breakfast Stout... It doesn't get much better than that... But wait it does... Happy hour from 4:30 to 6:30 all draft beer is half off!!! Yatzee!

Other drink options include an extensive list of margaritas and some nice cocktails as well.  Wine list is limited but acceptable.  Big Azz margaritas (22 oz) are seven bucks from 10 till midnight every night.

The food here is good and meets expectations as far as texmex goes.  I've tried the fajitas and a few of the burritos and have always been satisfied though never blown away.

The ambiance is definitely modern, trendy, and more fashionable than your average Shadyside joint, Although, in a non-upscale, unpretentious sort of way.  There is very limited outdoor seating, but garage doors at front do open up to let fresh air in."}
{"text":"We loved the tacos with tofu and honey. They were delicious. We also loved the fresh watermelon juice. The chips and salsa were okay."}
{"text":"If I lived locally I would definitely return here, for one reason alone.

Most \"Tex Mex\" restaurants recipes involve three items: meat, cheese, and tortilla. This place is no different. Their menu is mostly some variation of those three basic ingredients, which isn't a problem unless you have a hard time processing dairy.

I had a much difference experience the other night. All i did was order my burrito without the cheese. No other special requests or requirements.

Of all places, the kitchen decided it was best to separate their blue corn bread (which contains dairy) on another plate.

I was blown away. I've never received that level of care and forethought before in the five years I've had a difficulty processing dairy.

Absolutely fantastic performance from their kitchen staff. I've told everyone I've seen since about their quality decision making.

I know lactose intolerance isn't the end of the world if you have no problem digesting dairy. If you do have a hard time, you surely feel like I do: everything in America is covered with cheese.

That night I felt like someone I don't know cared."}
{"text":"I have given this spot 10 tries on faith and vibe alone.  Great people, hit spot and awesome kids menu with ice cream but food lacks originality and depth of flavor. Combos are bland, presentation is hurried and just frankly not that good. Anyone who has traveled to spots with cool text mex will know it!   Sorry.  Overrated."}
{"text":"We visited the Mad Mex at Shadyside and the ambience was pretty great and service as well was pretty good..
We had the burrito and it was really nice, the filling wasn't too spicy. We split it amongst two of us and so it was pretty filling as well..
We went on a weekend and had to wait for some period of time before being seated ...
The menu is slightly on the more expensive side as well.."}
{"text":"I came here Saturday evening yesterday and seeing that there were several seats available at the bar I took one and sat down. The bartender approached me and asked me what I would like. I said just a glass of water. She asked if I wanted anything else and I said no I'm fine. She gave me a disgruntled look and walked away. Shortly after, another bartender approached me and asked me if I wanted anything and I said I was okay. He said would you like a menu. Feeling a little guilty I agreed to take one but said I ate earlier. He then asked if I had any intention of ordering anything. I said I wasn't sure and then I offered to give up my seat if more people came, after which he then left. I immediately got off my seat and left the establishment.

I can't recall anytime in recent history being treated like that. While I respect the need for establishments to make money and to attract paying customers, it did not sit well with me that I could not even sit down at their bar and relax for a few moments with a drink of water. On plenty of occasions I've gone to other establishments and not been hassled over ordering water. If treated nicely or if the bar was crowded, I would tip when given water or would order something since I do understand their business needs. However, treating a potential customer like a vagrant off the street and not offering any initial hospitality is not a wise business model. This form of treatment makes them feel insulted and not only discourages them from becoming paying customers, but encourages them to write negative reviews and to share their story word of mouth to anyone who will listen.

If management is so adamant that every person entering their establishment is a paying customer then they must make it into a policy that is clear to incoming patrons. This can be done by putting up signs and also by training personnel to respectfully inform patrons of this policy when they sit at the bar. Digressing, if the bar was crowded and if I continued to order water then I could see their point.

One other point I should make is that I had just spent $60 at Casbah, the adjacent restaurant, which if I understand correctly, is operated under the same management. Regardless, no incoming patron deserves to be treated like a deadbeat. Any successful business model incorporates courtesy, respect, hospitality, and the crazy notion that any incoming patron has the potential to become a repeat customer if they are treated right. From the treatment I received, I can see that either no such model exists for this establishment, or the hiring or training regimen is in need of some TLC. The experience I had infuriated me and, short of a sincere apology, I will never go back and will share this experience with others."}
{"text":"Horribly rude service. Our table wasn't greeted or given a \"be right with you!\" for 12 minutes. It was 3:45pm and there were 3 other tables in the restaurant. Instead, servers awkwardly glanced at us and walked by pretending to be busy. When I asked the bartender if he could send a server to our table, he told me to \"give him a minute.\" Will never return."}
{"text":"Came here as part of our \"Sunday Funday\" on a weekend trip to Pittsburgh. Since it was a beautiful day, we were able to be seated next to the open front of the restaurant. We ordered margaritas which were decently priced and good. I am a bit of a margarita snob and I think these may have been made from a mix. We continued with some chicken nachos which were awesome. The chips were delicious and loaded with delicious cheesiness, salsa, guacamole, beans and sour cream.

What I have failed to mention is the interior of the restaurant. It is spacious and bright and seems like a great place to have a party. Service is really fast and friendly. A fun place to hang out!"}
{"text":"Don't forget to check the seasonal dishes on the inside cover. The corn and crab quesadilla is awesome and the Gobblerito may just change your life. Rotating taps are great and hockey games are fun to watch here."}
{"text":"First of all, the decor in here if offensively bad. It looks like a raging battle between a really crappy tattoo artist and a chic interior decorator, and what makes it worse is how pretentious it seems and how some straight male out there is probably really proud of it.

Second, the prices are kind of random and ridiculous for certain items. When you come here, don't expect to have a decent meal for less than 20$ once you ad a drink. This in and of itself is a crime to my mind when talking about Mexican food. Especially Tex-Mex. For instance, guacamole by itself cost 1.50 but chips with guacamole cost 7.50. Its good guac, but its not THAT good. And the chips are brutally crappy. I could buy similar quality chips at wal-mart.

I will give them credit for the tacos. I haven't personally tried them because I'm veggie and I don't like tofu, but my friend, who is a foodie, has enjoyed them on numerous occasions and says they're worth the cash. If you have a very good palette and enjoy fine dining but feel like tacos, these are the tacos for you. However, if you're not very discerning and enjoy a good taco stand, don't bother paying the extra for this.

Another thing that bothered me was the waitstaff. It isn't that they're terrible. They're just not that great either. They seem distant and disingenuous. Our waiter asked us if our food was good before we even had time to take a bite. The hostess looked positively miserable the entire time we were there and when we tried to eat here once before another hostess sat us in a high-top bar table without even asking if this was acceptable. I've been a hostess before. That, and the cold distant expression are both major party fouls. 

My final complaint is the nachos. They were so bad that I left a comment card expressing my disdain. These people clearly know how to cook or they wouldn't be able to make such good tacos, so, I beg to know, WTF? They were 10$, which is randomly cheap for the amount you get, but when you taste them you might understand why. You get a huge pile of guac and salsa, both of which would be more expensive ordered on their own, and an enormous pile of chips covered in melted monterey jack and black beans. The beans tasted just like the ranch beans you can buy at the grocery and the overall taste really was reminiscent of frito-chilli-pie that you can buy at Sonic. My foodie friend agreed with me on the egregiousness of the whole thing and we left that plate nearly untouched.

Therefore, my advice is, don't go here unless you have a very discerning palette don't mind spending more than is normal for food. If you do go, order the tacos. Do not order anything else. The steak on the tacos actually was medium rare, as asked for, and this was impressive. But if you'd be satisfied with a taco stand, just go to Pizza Sola. Its right down the street and the food is better, and cheaper, and the decor won't make you gag."}
{"text":"I come here often with my roommate's family. I have tried their burritos, enchiladas, tacos, and fajitas which are all good to huge portion sizes. They also usually come with rice and beans.

Their salsa is very chunky, mostly appearing as just finely diced tomatoes but has a nice level of spice. Not a huge fan of their guacamole. Needs a bit more acidity."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the most consistent Mad Max restaurants in the chain. Much like the rest, drinking here relies on you being here during Happy Hour or when they have the monthly brewery features where you can get 20oz drafts for 5 bucks.

Particular good favorites include the enchiladas, wing salad with cilantro lime dressing, and the pineapple habenero salsa.

Good atmosphere with the open garage doors, free valet next door, and a pleasant staff at this location."}
{"text":"This place is perfect in every way.  I love Mad Mex more than any other eating and drinking establishment in Pittsburgh.  Great food, amazing beer selection, delicious cocktails and a cool and funky atmosphere.  Service is always on-point.  This place gets busy so you may have to wait for a table during primetime dining hours.  If you have to wait - grab a drink at the bar and enjoy the craziness."}
{"text":"The ambiance was great. The food was okay. The service was absolutely terrible. I have a gluten allergy and when an order came with the pork marinated with beer, which wasn't mentioned on the menu, (tastes awesome, but will kill me) the waiter offered to get me a different order. He was really nice, and I ordered chicken instead, thanked him profusely. The new order looked like someone had just dumped ingredients in a pile, chicken was dry and flavorless. Later in the evening, he came by and actually stood with his back to me and faced my friend to ask him how everything was, and not me. Refused to refill our water. I tipped over 20% on our total order to show my appreciation for his extra help, despite the weirdness -- totally understand that allergies can be annoying for wait staff. When he put our extra food in a box, he dumped everything upside down. I would recommend using caution with this one. I've had fine experiences here in the past, but this was a deal breaker for me."}
{"text":"I like this location and I am a huge fan of margaritas and tacos. I always order the tofu tacos here. Trust me, they are amazing. Even Bobby, who does not care for tofu, thought they were good! 

Overall, it's a decent restaurant and it's nice that they offer valet service. Wait times are very unpredictable, though, so if you don't go on a more quiet night, you could be waiting for awhile (and probably outside because the foyer is so very small!)

Last time we were here we were seated upstairs. I thought this would be cool but it actually just seemed to result in slower service. I would request seating downstairs if the wait time isn't crazy.

The food is consistently good so we keep coming back!"}
{"text":"I had to write a positive review after my last two. And who better to review positively than Mad Mex?

This location is pretty huge and very busy at happy hour. We went on a Friday night and had to wait 15-20 minutes for a table for two, but it wasn't a big deal. I had the Mad Mex burrito (if that sounds like the correct name) and a big azz frozen apple pie type seasonal margarita. Which hit me like a ton of drunken bricks halfway through my burrito. Wow! Tequila is both my friend and my enemy. Anyway. The margarita was delicious, the burrito was delicious, service was good, and I have no complaints. Everything I've ever had at Mad Mex is good :)"}
{"text":"Decided to go and have some drinks on margarita day. Knowing it would be busy, was surprised to see only 1 person at the bar. Noticed quite a few people were also waiting to get a drink. They should of had more staff. Stood there for at least 10 minutes. Didn't get any acknowledgement. Heard great things about this place. Very disappointed.Left and went to Applebee's."}
{"text":"Decided to try some Mexican food in Pittsburgh during our visit from cali. 

Came here! Mostly because we saw this place when we tried Millie's the day before. We had walked by and mad mex was packed and we loved the open-ness of the restaurant itself. 

My husband ordered 2 large beers which he enjoyed. And I ordered guac -- it was tasty but I would have liked it a bit more spicy. We then ordered some salsa. 1. The pineapple habanero salsa which was deliciously sweet with the right amount of heat and 2. The fire roasted tomato salsa. Both were yummy in our tummies.

I ordered their special, the fried chicken tacos with sour cream siriacha. My only complaint was the size of the chicken pieces which were shoved into tortillas. The chicken was large and the tortillas were small. Maybe they could have been chopped up before assembling. 

My husband ordered a burrito with some of their inferno sauce on the side and he enjoyed it. 

My dish came with rice and beans but I was too full to eat more.

We sat in a booth next to the roll up door which was pretty cool.

I would return!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast burrito. Mad Maria is spicy and delish. Another great experience."}
{"text":"Best Mad Mex in the area, loads better than the Oakland location! The drinks are actually boozy enough to make them worth it. My husband likes the vegan burritos as well."}
{"text":"Mad Mex was my favorite restaurant in college. There seemed to always be a food or drink special. While I still enjoy their food, it seems prices have crept up and it doesn't seem like you get a good deal for the money. I do like brunch at the Shadyside location."}
{"text":"Best happy hour in town IMO (and I welcome anyone to suggest others that they love).  The beer list is really stellar - lots of local and regional micros.  The only with the beer list is that it can get out of date and have a few beers on it that are already kicked.

I'll occasionally get a margarita - they're solid for sure, but I'd recommend going for a high-end option if you can splurge for it.  They do a great job with those.

I like the food.  It's fast, tasty and fills you up.  I almost always order the same thing - Black Bean & Pineapple Quesadilla.  Perfect portion for me at a restaurant where the portion sizes can be a bit large at times.  I also really like the chicken tortilla soup, nachos (real cheese - not cheese sauce) and the spicy bean dip.

On weekend nights - be prepared for big crowds and a long wait."}
{"text":"As far as actual food goes, Mad Mex is Mad Mex and I have nothing really negative or positive to say about it.  You get what you expect when you come here.  It's typical Mad Mex food.  Burritos, tacos, chicken wings, all decent.
The service on the other hand.  Wow...just...unbelievably bad.  I still talk about it to people.  I gave them multiple chances.  I thought, one bad server does not completely ruin a place for me.  However, the top three worst experiences of my life server wise have all been at THIS Mad Mex.
Condescending, rude, and inattentive are the first three words that come to mind when I think of the service I experienced here.  I won't go back.  I will still go to other Mad Mex's but I will never go back to this one."}
{"text":"Much more spacious and cleaner than the Oakland location, which is tucked on a quiet residential street and a bit dingy. This place is pretty darkly lit as well, but the atmosphere is very different, as is the demographics. More lively. 

Same yummy $7 happy hour giant margaritas though! Although it's always a bit extra sour here..."}
{"text":"Ok here goes,

Mad Mex is the Tex-Mex offering of the Big Burrito conglomerate of restaurants. As far as Tex-Mex goes, you could do worse. You could do better, but let's just focus on the here and now. 

My girlfriend (a common partner in my culinary escapades) thinks that Mad Mex is,  to quote, \"the shit.\" At the risk of a  sreiously unhappy relationship, I must disagree. I think it is mediocre at best. 

We will start with the atmosphere of the place. It is packed to the walls with new age yuppies each trying to posture as much as possible and show the world how great they are. I don't care, I'm not impressed and neither is anyone else. As as result of everyone in the joint trying to tell the world how great they are, the noise level is a little high for my tastes. Also, after a certain hour, the lights are dimmed to the point where you can barely see your date (a potential plus if you have some evil friends who like blind dates), let alone read the menu. Not that it matters.

The menu is rather standard fare for Tex-Mex, but it all tastes the same. No matter what you get, it all tastes like spice with a vinegar, pickled backbone. I don't mind spice, hell I like it, but spice should be an accent to the flavor, not the sole player. 

Mad Mex has a decent beer selection, but it all seems to be kind of run of the mill craft selections. I know that sounds like an oxymoron so let me explain: they do have a fairly healthy variety of decent craft beers, but nothing unique to them. At least at a place like Fat Heads I can get something like Bear Republic Racer 5 on a hand pump. Mad Mex is limited to the standard Dogfishead, Rogue, and Sierra Nevada you see everywhere. As a Tex-Mex place, they do have a nice selection of tequila and their margaritas are \"bomb\" according to my better half.

As far as service goes, it was borderline, which I don't necessarily consider a bad thing. The servers were friendly and attentive, but not overbearing, which I like. They seemed to grasp the concept that I was there to enjoy my friends' company, not theirs.

All in all it wasn't a loathsome experience and I will probably be back, if only to satisfy the girlfriend. And now I am off to the couch..."}
{"text":"Pumking on draft, apple cider margaritas through September and the Gobblerito-what more could you want?!! This is my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh and so happy they opened this location in Shadyside which is much bigger and more open than the one in Oakland.  The happy hour specials are great-1/2 all drafts (they always have a great selection of beers), $7 big ass margaritas, and 1/2 priced wings. I usually get the $3 little butt margaritas on happy hour special so that I can try a few flavors including the new Sangria margarita. It wasn't as good as I was hoping but worth the try. The apple cider one is delicious with a sugar mixture around the rim to top it off.  Of course the Gobblerito was fantastic and worth the try even if you are a little hesitant."}
{"text":"I give Mad Mex mad props for a trendy atmosphere, top 40 music, good service, valet, and some creativity in their dishes.

The chimichanga wasn't what I was expecting, but the twist of using some kind of a red sauce and interesting seasoning made the dish worth while.

Why 3 stars?  An incredibly bland quesadilla, lame margaritas, and bleh queso were what made the lasting impression on me."}
{"text":"Dining with Style.

Wow; what a treat!  Arriving in Pittsburgh, I was told I couldn't leave without trying some Mexican food from Mad Mex, and I'm glad I did.

The restaurant is planned out amazingly well.  I'm told each location shares the same theme, but are decorated individually.  When the weather is nice they'll open up the large garage style doors that make up the front of the restaurant; which allows for the feeling that you're enjoying the outdoors while not needing to be exposed, that in mind they do have outdoor seating for those who wish to enjoy the weather fully.

They have a wide range of alcoholic beverages, but you have to try a flavored Margarita.  They have six of so to choose from, and you have have them froze or unfrozen.  It was warm enough day that the frozen ones were perfect for the situation.  Be careful though; they make'm strong ;)

The food was scrumptious and not overly priced.  Obviously with it's Mexican background the food is Mexican, but they are accommodating to requests  The burritos are huge and topped with the Mad Mex logo when it arrives at the table.  It appears they pay special attention to the finer details which allows their patrons to enjoy their amazing food, environment, and well attentive staff.

So; I'll say to you - You can't leave Pittsburgh without trying Mad Mex ;)"}
{"text":"Very unfortunate experience. I've been to Mad Mex multiple times, but unfortunately this location is different. I was enjoying my evening with friends and had had one drink with friends before we walked in. After everyone had asked for water, one of the waitresses told me she was uncomfortable serving me alcohol as I had apparently appeared intoxicated?? I guess one drink before you walk in makes you drunk, maybe because they can't sell you as much alcohol? Pretty weird stuff, wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"The food is amazing!! 
The restaurant has a very unique setup and a different vibe than others especially at night."}
{"text":"I love going to this Mad Mex especially during Happy Hour! The Southwestern Wings and Red Sangria \"Big Azz\" Margarita are my favorites! The wings are full of flavor and always crispy. And who can resist a 22oz margarita that's only $7??? Unlike the Mad Mex in Oakland, you can have conversations without yelling. By far, one of my favorite places for late night bites in the 'Burgh."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this restaurant ever since I moved to Pittsburgh because I've heard nothing but good things. We were seated right away and our waitress was friendly and gave us enough time to look at the menu. I ordered the seasonal pick which was the steak tacos with Mexican street corn and they were really good. I would definitely eat these again. Everything about the place was nice and I enjoyed my meal but it just wasn't the \"wow\" factor I was hoping for from everyones opinion. We also ordered the queso (hot) and the mango guac (out of this world). Id go back and try other stuff for sure"}
{"text":"OMG! This place... you most order the carnitas nachos for appetizer! Thennn for sure, a mondo combo with shrimps and steaks (this is a really good steak) 
Andddd don't forget every time you go, for dessert, the brownieeee oh my god!!! It is huge!!!! With a lot of chocolate fudge and ice cream! Incredible! Good prices too! Please GO! You won't regret it! :)"}
{"text":"A much as I don't enjoy the Shadyside crowd, this place was a nice addition to the South Highland string of places along the Shadyside/East Liberty wing of the East Side. The food (particularly the guacamole) and margaritas are great, particularly for the happy hour with a group of amigos. Fridays and Saturdays get crazy here, as the place quickly fills with snotty Shadyside goers, so make your plans accordingly. Bottom line: this is a vegetarian mecca with great food and booze!"}
{"text":"Our favorite family dining choice.  Delicious gluten free fish tacos and lots of dairy free and gluten free options as well.  Kids meals are a good value.  Margaritas delish. ;)"}
{"text":"We found this restaurant, which was in walking distance to our hotel, Hotel Indigo and were pleasantly surprised. The atmosphere was good, a little loud, good choice of music. The Big Azz Margarita was so tasty and proportioned appropriate to its name. We had the potato taquitos for our app.  We used the chipotle sauce on the table to spice it some. I had the Mad Mex Quesadilla with shrimp. It started out really good, but then my cheese got cold and it really fell apart from there. I ended up opening it and eating it with my fork. Great portion sizes, however. Our waiter Bill was also very attentive. Reasonably priced and in a good area."}
{"text":"The food was well seasoned and the atmosphere was nice. Perfect for families and a more than decent meal. Reminds me of Washington Park in Denver. 4 thumbs up!

p.s. The tortilla soup was worth it. Yum yum."}
{"text":"These guys are ok, I suppose. The service is what will make or break the experience. Today the service more than made up for any negatives caused by the wings, I mean food. It's not that the wings were dry, or lacking sauce, it was almost like national lampoons Christmas vacation when they cut the turkey open. 

Almost just like that. Except the smell, that's from Shadyside. 

The pick a dip with guacamole/queso/bean dip is a solid starter. Add a tequila sampler and some pints at happy hour and pleasant vibes are created. The crab quesadilla was pretty good as well. 

Nice energy on this, a great wodins day in the summer. Great staff for the most part. That's the real strength of any successful business."}
{"text":"OMG this place is awful!  I am shocked that so many people in the Pittsburgh area have such bad taste in \"Mexican\" food, as this place is typically packed.  To start, the salsa had zero flavor, and tasted like it was poured from a tin can of tomato mix.  The food resulted in a similar review; tasteless and a complete waste of money!"}
{"text":"Although Mad Mex is a super trendy joint on South Highland, I would take Steel Cactus over it anyway! Their dips (salsa, guac, queso) don't even compare in my eyes! Their frozen margaritas are a decent price, but I hate that happy hour at a Mexican restaurant features beer and wings?! Service has always been average here. Not my favorite, but it does have a convenient location."}
{"text":"Happily surprised with the spicy portabello burritos. Super tasty and all the better for being free for my birthday! They also have a great happy hour from 4-6 with $3 margaritas!!! (and half off drafts). Great deal, better than expected food. They also have the option to get a growler of beer, which holds like 5 beers and it seems to be a good deal too (~$12)."}
{"text":"I have been to Mad Mex several times with mixed results.  Unfortunately, yesterday was definitely the WORST. I ordered the nachos with taco meat.  It looked awful when it was served and tasted worst.  Still undeterred I ordered the shrimp taquitos.  Again, the presentation was horrible, the exterior soggy and oily, the interior looked like cat food and tasted like it (I'm sure).  We were sitting at the bar, 3 of us and our service was mediocre. When I told our young bartender that my food was really bad she said nothing and did nothing.  I will never eat there again!"}
{"text":"The worst beef enchiladas I've ever tasted. The meat looked and smelled like dog food. I will never eat there again."}
{"text":"I have ordered a ton of food on the menu throughout the years. My favorite are the tofu tacos. When I come for lunch, like I did a few days ago, they have a great lunch menu. They have a burrito combo with soup or salad. If you get a mad mex burrito the combo is $9. Any other burrito the combo is $10. I ordered the veggie burrito with the tortilla soup. We also ordered the black bean dip with chips as a starter. Mmmmmm soooo good. 

Service is typically quick. Servers are friendly. The only issue is parking. They do have valet across the street but I'm cheap. Finding parking on the street is not always easy but can be done. When I have a craving for mad mex the parking doesn't steer me away, I eventually find a spot."}
{"text":"I always like Mad Mex. It's not authentic tacos at all, but the food is pretty good and really large portions.

I usually get one of their margaritas. While they do have the big frozen ones that I think they're known for, I usually go for one of the others on the menu. I like the Ruby Red grapefruit one, but recently tried a seasonal cranberry sage margarita that was delicious. 

If you join their mailing list, you can get coupons and I frequently go then. It's fun to split a burrito and their waffle fries. The waffle fries with queso and ranch are really good. There are also good wings and this location has seitan wings, which I've never gotten, but have heard are delicious. 

This location gets pretty busy, especially during happy hour times, but the wait usually isn't too bad and service is fairly quick even when it is packed. It does get really loud though, so be aware of that. I love the decorations here. It's really big and airy and just a great location. Much better than the tiny one in Oakland."}
{"text":"Mad Mex = Awesome...

I like the fact that even my veggie head brother and sister can come here and have OPTIONS!!!    You know it is going to be good here, but the Robinson one is the best of the bunch!

Slainte my agave loving friends!"}
{"text":"LOVE the food. LOVE the margarittas. LOVE the half off deals. LOVE everything abou it. I've been to the Mad Mex in Philly, State College, and two in Pittsburgh. All of them serve great food and service and has never failed me. My favorite location is the new one in Pittsburgh because it's spacious inside and turn on good house/techno music (it is kind of too loud). I think Mad Mex has the best wings and nachos and I always have to get one of these. I cannot resist not getting them!"}
{"text":"Just ok.  Black bean dip is the best.  The rest is not as good as Chipotle.   They need to spruce up their menu a bit."}
{"text":"I had brunch with my husband at Mad Mex a few months ago. It was great and I can't wait to go back! They are very accommodating to vegetarians and vegans - most things can be modified for various diets. My husband is a meat-eater and he also loved his meal. It has a really fun atmosphere, generous portions, and reasonable prices. They do seem to get really busy at times, so you may want to have a back-up plan if you're in a hurry, but otherwise I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Mad Mex (Shadyside) really went above and beyond for my group of 15 people! They accommodated us and arranged it so we could all sit together as we wish a friend safe and happy travels abroad. Adam was our server and did everything possible to make the experience enjoyable. To top it all off the food was great! Thank you to all the staff that made this dinner possible!"}
{"text":"i wish i had done my due diligence and researched more places on my visit to Pittsburgh. i was out there for work, and it was a short trip, so i didn't really think i'd have much time to explore. i took the suggestion from someone to hit up mad mex and, well... let's just say the thing about this place is, it's just not authentic mexican. i even prefer chevy's mexican over this place... but it reminds me of a chevy-like atmosphere.

i'm even more grateful for the good mexican food i can get at home. thank you mission district. :)"}
{"text":"Came at 6pm on Friday. Very packed. We waited 20 minutes to be seated. 

We ordered an appetizer of Guacamole and salsa w/chips. Chips were tasty, but the salsa wasn't even salsa, just some weird mashed tomato spread that hadn't any other flavor other that sour tomatoes. The guac was very creamy and fulfilling though. 

Chicken Chimi - my partner ordered this after I said it was a fried burrito. It was just okay, but he wanted to just eat my burrito since it was a lot tastier. 

Carnitas Burrito - the burrito I ordered. Most excellent!  Delicious pulled pork, with sour cream, it's a dream!

The true star of the show was the blue corn corn bread slice I got by ordering the Carnitas Burrito. It was so good, like cake. Doughy, spongy, moist, the best cornbread I've ever had."}
{"text":"Have eaten here twice now within the past month and everything is solid about it. Back in college, I use to go to half off and the Oakland Mad Mex, but that was the only good part since the space was cramped and crowds were rowdy; this newer location solves those problems and it even has complimentary valet parking! ($2 tip) The space is huge and I have had no problems walking in on a Saturday night with a group of 5.

The margaritas here are definitely a good deal during happy hour and the Big Azz hits the spot. Most of the flavors use real fruit so they can be on the tart side but I enjoy the fresh flavor. You cant go wrong with the guac and chips here or the wings as both are made very well and I cant make any complaints about the taste of the entrees I've gotten (Chicken Fajita, Chicken Burrito). The portion is also huge so there's no way you'll walk out hungry.

I will definitely come back again because its convenient and a guaranteed good time any night."}
{"text":"Food is good, prices are reasonable. The variety of beers on draught are amazing. The menu is also vegetarian/ vegan friendly so there end up being a lot of food options- you aren't stuck ordering the same dish every time. I just wish this place was a little less loud- you can barely hear your friends when you are sitting at the bar or eating dinner."}
{"text":"I've been waiting to review this Mex since it opened right by mi casa.  I've already been there dozens of times...  I was there with the masses on opening night, and I even chose it over Casbah for my graduation (unorthodox, I know).  But my experiences last night pushed me into writing the review.

I showed up with my guy friends who were being a little rowdy, but the service from the hosts, the waitress, and the bartender was excellent.  Our waitress was so nice that she let us keep our table for a full hour after the dining area closed, without complaining.  Of course, once we realized that we were supposed to have moved to the bar by then, we closed our enormous tab with her.  Kudos.  Every time I've been to this Mex, the service has been friendly and fun--the wait staff edges on flirty and likes dress in themes relating to this week's celebrity hot mess (last night was Ke$ha).  It's entertaining.

As far as the food goes, I'm totally aware that this is not legit Mexican, Tex-Mex, or Cali-Mex.  It's Penna-Mex.  Which I'm totally okay with; it appeals to my bland palate.  I could eat the chicken Mad Mex Quesadilla--the most unoriginality titled item on the menu--every day. 

The beer selection ranges from seasonals (pumpkins, harvests, Oktoberfests) to locals (East End, Penn) to unique (whatever the hot microbrewery of the moment is--Great Lakes, Brooklyn) to the decent standards (Blue Moon).  Recently, I've tried the Brooklyn Oktoberfest and Southern Tier Pumpkin, and I liked both.  The liquor varies from top shelf to bottom of the barrel, and the pours are weak.

That leaves the margaritas.  Mad Mex Big Azz margs and I go way back to the days of living in South Oakland when we'd sit on my friend's porch across the street and try to figure out the perfect time to show up to take advantage of both the marg special and the half-price student special.  After a summer in Texas, I'm no longer a big fan of the frozen margarita, but I love a good marg on the rocks.  Unfortunately, the Big Azz on the rocks is not something one can drink without furrowed brows and puckered lips.  But, yes, it will get you drunk in a hurry if you can't afford one of the top shelf margs.

The atmosphere is the best of the Mex here.  It's kitschy.  But the larger bar area and the garage door side make up of the silliness of the decor.

Tip: If you go on a weekend, you can use the FREE valet for Casbah across the street (both are owned by Big Burrito).  The cost of the tip is probably worth avoiding the frustration of circling around Shadyside for a nonexistent parking spot."}
{"text":"Service is usually pretty good. There are a few servers who can be a little absent minded but for the most part I've never had a terrible experience (I've been here ALOT). This past weekend I was there for a bachelorette with a party of 9 and our waitress was very good....staying on top of what we needed and allowing us to get all separate checks while shuffling a few things around (apps and the bride's dinner). 

The guacamole is super delicious, but I think It's overpriced (I actually find a lot of the entrees to be overpriced but I know they use quality ingredients). The app is $7 for a small bowl (though it comes with unlimited chips and a small bowl of salsa as well). What can I say, I like a lot of guac on my chips. 

The tortilla soup is DELICIOUS and is a good choice if you're trying to be calorie conscious. I usually sub it for a side...it's an upcharge though. 

I usually get the steak quesadilla. It's plenty of food and I like that you have the option of a whole wheat tortilla. No matter what I get, I typically always have leftovers to take home. 

Happy hour is also good with half off drafts and specials on margaritas and wings. It gets crowded after work so arrive early if you don't want to wait for a table."}
{"text":"Gobblerito- thanksgiving dinner in a burrito. Amaze balls. The pick-a-dippa was a great appetizer with some mildly spicy salsa and cheese. Unique concoctions in addition to traditional Mexican cuisine. 

So why did I dock it 1 star? 
Service. 
We had to hunt our server down 3 different times for refills. A fourth time for our check and to-go containers.
The cooks also messed up a couple orders but the server graciously compensated us for the inconveniences. We'll definitely be back next time we're in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. Out of all the locations, I do like this one the best. Large bar area, some outdoor and partial outdoor seating. Upstairs tier as well. 
Great beer selection. Multiple crafts of tap and bottle selection. Margaritas: this is probably the only place I get a margarita. Ever since college when Tequila and I broke up, I have steered clear from even the margarita. Mad Mex makes a great one. Seasonal ones are pricey. Stick to the classic. 
Food. I love their chips and salsa.  That the best part of the meal as far as I'm concerned. You can also get this to go which is typically a hit for the on the go party appetizer. The trio dip app is worth it. Definitely get the guac. It's great. 
Every burrito I've had has been awesome. I'm partial to the fajita one. As of late I've been on to the mahi tacos. Fresh, and a little lighter than the burritos. Last time I asked for no rice and they LOADED me up with black beans to sub. Great to not skimp on that. The black beans are lovely, too. You can also get the burritos in a bowl. 
The Pennsyltucky tofu app is pretty damn delicious. 
Now...the must is the Gobbblerito at Thanksgiving (and occasionally in the summer or craft beer week by surprise.) Why does Thanksgiving dinner taste so good in a burrito? Because it does. 
They also have awesome mail coupons and free entree for your birthday if you sign up. Happy Birthday!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice. Each time was a very good experience.  The Big Ass House margarita is a given. Generally house Margaritas turn me off. Not these!  They are big and bad with a good quality taste. 
The nachos are stacked high and truly more than a meal. I love the great variety of burritos and the Spicy is just that.  A little heat. A little spice. Not hot enough to make you sweat but hot enough to make you want to order another margarita. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Always such amazing food, and an awesome happy hour/late night special. Great for groups or a date night, or sitting solo at the bar. Lots of options for every kind of eater/diet, made clear on the menu and on their website. Vegan options are especially nice, with vegan cheese and sour cream options at no extra cost :)

The prices are usually around 10 bucks a dish, but their portions are HUGE and keep super well for a leftover meal (or two).

I'm a fan of this location since it's so big (although it'll still be packed with an hour wait on a Friday or Saturday night), and in the summer it's a real treat to sit with a Bigazz margarita with the big windows open to Highland Avenue."}
{"text":"I love the Shadyside location, especially when the weather is nice and the garage doors/windows are open and there is a fun, open air feel. 

They have a lot of beers on tap, and they have a lot of local selections as well. The margaritas are good as well, and I love the happy hour specials where you can get $7 big azz margaritas. Yum.

Some of my favorite things on the menu include the black bean dip which is creamy, spicy, and completely vegetarian, as well as the shrimp and spinach quesadilla. You have the option to get a whole wheat tortilla, which is nice. I also love the California salad which is loaded with alfalfa sprouts. 

The vegan ranch is interesting, but I prefer the regular ranch dressing. Yum! It's great that there are so many vegan and vegetarian options, though. My brother is vegan, and when he comes to visit from Nashville (where there aren't a ton of vegan options), he always wants to go to Mad Mex."}
{"text":"I love this place! My boyfriend and I always sit at the bar and the staff is extremely friendly. On top of that the food is always prompt and delicious. Highly recommended. Not only a great restaurant but my favorite Mad Mex location."}
{"text":"They have amazing margaritas and the food is OK. It's kind of pricey but there's no good Mexican food in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Oh Mad Mex, I want to love you, and I keep trying, but the service is such a letdown 90% of the time that it puts such a damper on the delicious food. Most of the waitstaff seem like they'd rather be anywhere else but working there, and do the absolute bare minimum for patrons. After taking a 6-month hiatus because of my frustration, I went back, and was once again faced with a rude, distant and slow waiter. I'll be dreaming of the chips and 3 dips appetizer and super mad mex burrito for a long time, but my self-imposed hiatus will resume."}
{"text":"Relatively cheap and convenient.  Certainly not a bad place to have in your neighborhood.  I like hanging out at Mad Mex, but it certainly wouldn't be my first choice for a solid Mexican meal.  The service is solid, but the actual food quality is merely good.  I've been here on two different occasions and have tried both the Hippie Burrito and the Veggie Enchiladas.  Both dishes are decent, but are really nothing memorable.  The bar on the other hand, is really cool.  A great place to catch a game if you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I want to update my previous review.  Food and service were pretty great at this Friendsgiving."}
{"text":"Between their Oakland location and here, this one is waaay better. The overall ambience is nicer (not full of college students), and their staff is really friendly.  

Both have pretty good portions and prices for their food. I usually leave this place full AF, or end up bringing leftovers home. I haven't had anything that screams at me to come back. It's a good place to hangout and grab some drinks, but nothing special."}
{"text":"I am ridiculously ashamed that in all my years in this fair city of Pittsburgh and my three years Yelping, I have yet to review this fine establishment.  I suppose the Shadyside location is among the more recent additions to the Mad Mex crew, so maybe I get a pass?  

ANYWAY - Mad Mex is just fabulous...even moreso in the fall when the all-important Gobblerito takes centerstage and fills my belly with an entire Thanksgiving meal swaddled in a delightful flourly shell.  Aside from the Gobblerito, MM has plenty to offer year-round, include those of us who love a good vegetarian meal when they're not scarfing down turkey by the pound.  MM's menu is a delight to every Tex-Mex palate and their wings aren't too bad either.  Throw in a great beer list and the best margaritas north of Mexico City and you've got a true Pittsburgh favorite. Pass the guacamole, please."}
{"text":"This place is hip and fun.

Definitely sit at the bar as your chips and salsa are free as opposed to sitting at a table where you have to pay for it. 

Also their bar staff have been there a while and know the menu and are very attentive to the customers.

However the host was unpleasant when we had asked for a seat near the bar to view the tv. The food runner told the dropped out food off and was too busy to answer the wifi password or to grab ketchup for the fries we had ordered.

All and all this is a great restaurant with great beer and food. The management should have a chat with their crew regarding customer service though."}
{"text":"I do not usually review \"franchise\" restaurants but I have been (and enjoyed myself) so many times in this location that I feel I should do it. This location is very vibrant, good energy and ambiance and of course good Mexican (or tex-mex if you prefer) food. If you have ever been to another mad mex you know that their margaritas are killers and a must try. I have never had a bad service experience. Also during the summer the storefront opens and sitting in the booths by the windows makes the experience even better. Certainly a good place to have lunch, dinner or just a drink with small or large company!"}
{"text":"What's better than a margarita? A big Azz margarita and I had two. 

The interior of this location has a great loft feel and is breezy, chill and laid back and has plenty of room for every one.  The house was packed on a Sunday at 6pm but I was still seated within 5 minutes.  My eyes lit up when I saw on the menu  Kaya's Yucatan Black Bean Dip!  Whomever at Madmex put that on the menu kudos to you Sir or Madam.  

So for my other two dips  I ordered the, Tomatillo-Avocado, and the pico de gallo.

The pico de gallo was dry and way over peppered the whole thing tasted of pepper and not much else. 

I am trying to clear off my calendar so that I can get back to Mad Mex for some more tequila and good eats! 

Listen pals get the Black Bean Dip!"}
{"text":"Mahi salad with lime cilantro vinaigrette dressing. To die for.

Other than that, I'm fairly \"meh\" about their food, but they do have a nice beer list, and the ambiance is interesting. This is a great place to go on a warm summer evening to sit outside, or near the outside area and observe street life on Highland Ave."}
{"text":"The food is normal. The service is good, but what I didn't like is the fact I have ordered no spicy food and my food was very spicy that I couldn't eat! The waitress told is not spicy at all, but it was. So if you don't like spicy food, don't go there."}
{"text":"I love mad mex, but I find their cheese dip prohibitively spicy. It would be great if they added a milder version to the menu."}
{"text":"If you are under 30, a student, and in love with tex-mex, you've found your Mecca. They have very great drink specials at night and half off lunches for students during 2-4 (check with them though...) 

The food is nothing remarkable (okay tex-mex that is nothing you will find in the south), but good for taking someone to lunch if you want to talk in an open and cheery environment in the summer; they have a kind of garage door that opens up the large industrial south of the border restaurant. 

This place is definitely focused on the drinks and happy hour."}
{"text":"I went here with a dozen friends shortly after Mad Mex Shadyside opened. Being used to the Oakland one where one could get an impressively stiff margarita on an undergraduate budget, we all ordered margaritas and dinners, some opting for a floater.

While the margaritas were palatable, outside of the floater there was so little tequila or triple sec that it was unclear whether or not the drinks were actually alcoholic. Further, the floaters were a dismal half to a third of a shot. As far as any of us can tell, we paid $10 for a half shot of tequila and 20 ounces of non-alcoholic mix.

The food was good as is the food at all Big Burrito restaurants I've been to, but I think next time I want a margarita I'll either mix it myself or try one of the many other fine bars in Shadyside."}
{"text":"I went on a Saturday night and I got seated right away, and my server, LG, was very helpful about the menu and the wine selections.  Nobody ever said Mad Mex is Mexican or even Tex Mex, it's definitely California Mexican...and as long as you understand that, you will do better there.  Having said that, I don't think they have a very good Margarita (which should be tequila, triple sec or Cointreau, and fresh lime juice).  The food at Mad Mex tastes great and it's made from fresh ingredients.  The decor is consistent with the Mad Mex branding, and there's original artwork throughout the restaurant.  I love the high ceiling, the different seating options, and the huge open wall that faces Highland Ave.  This is by far my favorite of all the Mad Mex locations."}
{"text":"I came here the other day with a couple of friends to celebrate my friend's birthday. They have a solid margarita and I LOVE the Grilled Chicken Torta. Even though everything else on the menu looks good and my friend always gets the fajitas because he swears that's the best dish, I just keep getting the same thing. It gives me the illusion that I'm eating something healthy because it's grilled chicken and a salad (maybe it is healthy?), but it's also super flavorful. It comes with a chipotle aioli sauce, as well as a cilantro dressing, and they both go well with the dish (and together). We also got a Mexican Chocolate Brownie that was tasty. It was warm and we got it with a scoop of ice cream on top -- so good.

The service was quite good. I say this because my friend signed up to get a free birthday entree, but since he was born on a leap year, he never got an email with his free birthday entree. We told our server though and she was able to arrange for him to get his complimentary entree!"}
{"text":"super-happy that there's a mad mex within a mile of my place.  even happier that there's quasi-outdoor seating with the huge, beautiful garage windows out front.  the margarita varieties are great, and you can get a big azz one for $7 during happy hours.  the wings are pretty spot-on considering you're at a mexican joint, and i'm a big fan of their medium salsa.  plus -- complimentary valet is usually pretty convenient instead of fighting the ellsworth shadyside parking scene.

why did i dock a star?  sometimes the waitstaff are too busy chatting with their friends to bother taking care of you.  also, the valet service guys sometimes give me a hard time for having a huge truck.  an actual quote: \"where do you want me to put this?!\"  really?  that's sort of your job.

anyway, i digress.  the food is good.  the margaritas are great.  and, someone may or may not park your car or truck for free.  totally worthy of 4 stars."}
{"text":"They have good discounts at night! So my sis and I woke up after our dinner food comas to get a drink here at Mad Mex. $7 32-ounce margaritas and half priced food. 

We came in at 11pm, at the right time for both of those offers. We ordered the sangria infused margarita (twice), boneless chicken wings and nachos. The nachos were alright, but when the cheese isn't liquid-like, I prefer that the shredded cheese be in obnoxious amounts. And that did not happen, even though I ordered extra cheese just in case. 

The spicy boneless wings were not spicy, and could have used more sauce. The shape was also really strange, almost looked like a tiny tilapia fillet. I guess I was expecting more of a nugget, BWW typed wing, but it was fine either way. For $22, I can't complain. We left tipsy and full at 1am. Thanks Mad Mex!"}
{"text":"How about a special holiday update on this place.  As you can see they have redeemed their self, at least a little bit with my most recent visit.

I was craving a Gobblerito, and this being the closest location to where I live, I begrudgingly came here.  I am happy to report, I survived and I was left with a better taste in my mouth (now, was that pun intended?).

I am not sure if it was where we were seated this time (I requested the booth), the server (so much more attentive, she heard everything we said), or if it were the overall experience that made this time so much better.

We started with the obligatory chips and salsa.  I also ordered a draft.  What I thought was going to start a downhill slip started with this draft.  The one I ordered just happened to kick the keg halfway filling up the glass.  Our server, Caitlin was her name, assured me that they were checking to see if they had another keg, if they did not, she would be back to ask if I wanted anything else.  I was thinking to myself, \"great, here we go again,\" however, she returned with a full glass of my draft, with that, we were over our little hiccup for the evening (another pun).

Everything came out perfect after that.  My Gobblerito was amazing.  Who can argue with Thanksgiving food being stuffed inside a burrito and topped with gravy?  Three good slices of turkey, a serving of stuffing, a serving of mashed potatoes with black beans and some corn stuffed oh so lovingly into a huge burrito.  Top it with a hot serving of gravy, a side of cranberry sauce stuff, and you have your Thanksgiving early.  

My friends, I must warn y'all, This is a limited time item on their menu.  As I write this, I believe you only are able to get it for the next two days.  So RUN, don't walk to your nearest Mad Mex and enjoy this delectable item while you can!"}
{"text":"Home of the best tofu tacos on the planet. The tofu is chrispy fried and topped with a soy citrus sauce, bean sprouts, avocado, cilantro, and salsa. It tastes so fresh and each bite is packed full of flavor. After discovering these tacos, I get them every single time I'm at Mad Mex."}
{"text":"Nice happy hour specials. The black bean dip is delicious!  I was very pleased with my red velvet quesadillas. Enjoyed the music. All I needed was a dance floor. Good service. I'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch the day after Thanksgiving.  Service was great and the food was unbelievable.  We ate so much, that we ended up cancelling dinner plans that night.  Come hungry, leave full.  I look forward to another visit to Pittsburgh so we can dine here again."}
{"text":"Ok, Mad Mex, you're off the hook from me. I came here for a Saturday afternoon brunch and was quite pleased.

Service was friendly, attentive and fast. Food was good. Prices, same as they ever were.

I had the chicken mole burrito. Not bad, flavor wasn't as strong as I imagine a mole should be but it was still a decent meal. I didn't order the Gobblerito but methinks I'll be coming back to try that one soon!"}
{"text":"Its the best overpriced Mexican  in town.  I do love the food. We cone for happy hour for discounted drinks! Love the pika dippa great sip to chip ratio! Its just well a $9 Mexican app :/"}
{"text":"Their \"Tex Mex\" is actually pretty sub-par, but I would come just for the wings and the big azz margaritas. The flavors are amazing. The best time of year to come is definitely in the fall because they have the gobblerito (a Thanksgiving food burrito essentially) and apple cider margaritas, both of which are amazing. I love the Shadyside location as opposed to the Oakland location strictly based on the people who go and space. The Shadyside location is way more spacious and the Oakland location is TINY. Like, 8-9 tables and the bar tiny. Plus its all college students."}
{"text":"Mad Mex Shadyside is our favorite spot to drink and get food we know we're going to love. I would bring friends here from out of town because I know they'd enjoy the atmosphere. I enjoy getting to sit outside or with the large doors opened. Definitely a great location and even better place to grab drinks!"}
{"text":"Standard Tex-Mex fare.  The burrito was good, but the guac tasted pre-made from a container.  The atmosphere is interesting and unique with the artwork on the walls.  It's was fairly busy for a Wednesday night, but we got a table right away, which is nice.  Service was okay, nothing to get excited about, but can't complain.  It's a decent spot for Tex-Mex food.  Being on Highland Ave, the parking can be a nightmare, so plan on pulling around a bit looking for a spot on the street."}
{"text":"I gave Mad Mex another go and had a much better experience this time. My friend and I were seated right away, the server was friendly and attentive and our food was great. I had the Mahi Mahi Fajita and it was delicious. I am glad that I gave this Mad Mex another shot and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Haven't been in years so I met some friends for drinks. Tried the shrimp quesadilla and a sangria margarita. Good food. The service was ok. I used to go to the Oakland location and remember good food and a loud environment. I would go back but prefer late night when it's a bit more calm."}
{"text":"This is good 'ol Americanized Mexican food with big portions, decent prices (in general), and awesome allergen information! Two of the friends I was dining with are vegan and there were a ton of options for them, which was a huge plus! They even have Daiya dairy/soy/gluten free cheese! 

Anywho, I'll start with the drink I ordered. I got a 12 dollar Don Julio VIP margarita that has an inside out lime floating on top (a floater) and a shot of tequila in it. I got it on the rocks, which I regretted, because the thing was EXTREMELY watered down, almost tasteless. I won't be spending 12 dollars on that again. You can add the floater to any drink, so I think I'd get the 5 dollar margarita and add it on instead in the future!

As for the meal, they have a lot of options for people who are gluten free! All of the allergen information is listed clearly on their website for dairy, gluten, soy and peanut. You must inquire about any other allergies. They have a lot of gluten free options, such as their plain meats (carnitas, steak, chicken, shrimp) and you can sub in a corn tortilla for a lot of the menu items. They also have a \"bare-ito\" that allows you to make any burrito into a bowl! Good stuff. 

Soy allergy info: There are not a lot of soy-free options or substitutes here. Almost everything is marinated, fried, or cooked in soybean oil. 

For this reason, I got a plain salad with tomatoes on it with oil and vinegar. They charged me 9 dollars for it. I wasn't too happy about that, but whatever. The rest of my friends' portions were huge and delicious for a good price. Our waitress was super friendly and all of my friends enjoyed their meals. 

I really bumped up the stars from 3 because of the vast options and information they have for those with dietary restrictions, as well as the good service."}
{"text":"Nice addition to the Highland Ave restaurant scene in Shadyside. The food is always good, especially the picka dippa XX cheese and black bean dip. The Mad Mex burrito is the staple meal, but the fajitas, salsa, and wings are also delicious."}
{"text":"Better than I thought it would be! Great beers and had excellent pork tacos. Wife had burrito bowl that was huge and really delicious. Will be back. Oh - good service too."}
{"text":"Meh. I was pretty enthused about this Mad Mex. Huge open area, valet parking, close to the house, plus the Big Azz Margaritas; I mean what's not to love? Well... first of all, that huge open space? Somehow no air gets in. It's so stagnate in there! Please, get some fans going or something. Second, I think the hostesses are still working out how to seat people. They shoved everyone in this long bench area while nice booths were sitting there empty.  Finally the food was seriously Meh. My shrimp were cooked to a rubbery car tire consistency. Now, the plus is that they have great drink and food specials, so I suggest eating past 11pm when food is 1/2 off and drinking past 10pm when Big Azz Margaritas are $7."}
{"text":"Mad Mex is always a hit for me. I love Mex-American cuisine. I think they have the best chicken wings in Pittsburgh. For Happy Hour(4:30-6:30) they are half off. San Francisco Wild is my go to. It is a little sweet with a very nice heat kick. Their house margaritas are pretty good with many flavors if you choose. They can be on the rocks or frozen. I usually do the Big Azz one which I think is 22oz, regular, on the rocks, with no salt. They also have some signature ones which are a little pricier. They are made with fresh juices. The V.I.P. is my favorite. The wingorito's are also great. you get a very big burrito for the price. The menu caters to everyone and is very whimsical. The atmosphere is always great, with dim lights, cool art work, and nice music. It is a hip spot for food and drinks. They have so much Tequila so you can get a Margarita however you want. Just Ask!"}
{"text":"I am from Ann Arbor and was visiting Pittsburgh. We visited this place in the evening.. It was bustling with activity but found a nice corner table facing the street. Food was excellent! Nachos were delicious. The best dish was the tacos with tofu. It was the best taco we ever had.. Very vegetarian friendly place with a lot of options... Will visit it the next time I go to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Mad Mex has been a staple of my life since college in the city. The Shadyside location is always quite busy but the size of the restaurant helps alleviate the wait times. 

Food is almost always good. Wasn't terribly hungry this night so just ordered wings w San Fran sauce. Crispy wings and sweet/spicy balance on the sauce was excellent. 

As always I feel the margaritas are the star attraction, even with the good food. Can't beat the half-price Big Azz ones late at night or during happy hour. 

Always a recommended stop for a good drink, great atmosphere (though always very dark) and a solid menu."}
{"text":"With margaritas and burritos on the menu, this place is a slice of heaven by default.

I'm a sucker for their seasonal specialty burritos. The gobblerito around Thanksgiving is amazing, which predictably is stuffed with turkey, cranberry relish, stuffing, gravy and other Thanksgiving fixins'. I also recently tried the pulled pork BBQ burrito, which didn't disappoint! They definitely don't skimp on the meat here.

Also, a lot of the burritos they serve are often big enough to feed a family of three.

The best part? The $7 Big Azz (22 oz!) margaritas from 10 p.m. to midnight everyday, of course. You really don't need more than one to feel the tequila coursing through your veins."}
{"text":"Ive had my first real problem here tonight. Our waiter took our drink order without explaining that they have a house policy preventing them from serving us our tequila flight along with margaritas. So my friend asks where our flight is. The response by their staff will guarantee that I never spend another dime here."}
{"text":"We had the Sriracha Chicken Tacos. Amazing!!! I hope that they keep them on the menu. As always, beer was good. Can't beat the $5 22!ounce beers."}
{"text":"I don't see what all the rage is. I really enjoy Mexican food and just feel like Mad Mex is really lacking in their preparation, especially when it comes to their use of spices.  What was particularly disappointing was their beef tacos.  The seasoning was awful, and made the meal totally undesirable. This place is nothing to call home about."}
{"text":"I got the wingo rito with classic buffalo sauce. It was DISGUSTING. They put huge chunks of uncooked chicken that looked and tasted gross. It was chewy and just terrible. It made me puke for hours after eating it. Don't eat here. Save yourself the money. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Good food and laid back atmosphere. Love the seasonal Margaritas, hate the very loud music... Not too expensive for what you get, but portions could be a bit more generous. Overall staff is friendly, but I've occasionally had a pushy waitress."}
{"text":"Mad Mex is a solid three to four stars and I'm settling with four because the things that take an experience down a notch are largely out of their control. 

Happy Hours here are a great deal. Their tap selection usually showcases an exceptional range and variety and their mixed drinks stand up to comparison with much more cocktail-oriented bars. The staff here is friendly and accommodating even when they are completely slammed [which is when I encounter a more three star experience ]. 

Wait times -- which are largely out of their control -- can be excessive on weekends so if you're coming here on a Friday happy hour, get here early and prepare for a crowd. If crowds are your thing, then this is your place. 

Food is consistently well prepared and inventive [although the menu doesn't change often]. Their Sunday brunch which I just tried for the first time recently is a highlight. 

All in all, not a bad place to unwind after the week, meet friends for a Sunday Funday, or grab lunch during the work week."}
{"text":"My wife and I came in asked for table for 6 4 adults 2 children
We were told had to wait until everyone arrived 
Asked to go to the bar for a drink
The bar was full
Went back to the front and watched 1 man come in and asked for table for 4 then 2 came in and asked for table for 4
Both were seated 
While we stood and waited."}
{"text":"Yum! Usually as a vegetarian, I hear that someone has picked a Mexican restaurant for a group dinner and I sigh. 90% of the time I end up getting a bean and rice burrito and enough frozen sour mix to make me never want sweets again. Mad Mex isn't really even Mexican, which worked tremendously to my benefit. It's Tex-Mex inspired but they really consider using fresh ingredients and working different cuisines into the menu whenever possible. They had so many veggie options, from seitan wings to marinated tofu and veggie-abundant enchiladas. Everything we had was great, including the not-too-sweet sangria margaritas. I'd gladly go back!"}
{"text":"Good fresh California style Mexican food  in an unlikely locale.  Lots of meat in the chicken quesadilla.  Nachos grande lived up to the name - huge - plenty for 2 or even 3."}
{"text":"I remember coming to Mad Mex consistently as a kid, but I recently came here with a date when he could not believe that I hadn't been to a Mad Mex in years.   It is just as good as my childhood memories made me believe it was.

I played it safe and got the Mad Mex Burrito with shrimp ($9.50).  What I love about Mad Mex is that they don't charge different amounts for shrimp versus chicken.  I am not a huge meat eater so this makes it worth the slightly higher price tag for me.  The burrito is packed with rice, black beans, and cheese, and the size is huge.  I love the square pocket shape with the super soft tortillas.  The salsa and lettuce on the outside was a bit unappetizing looking so I avoided it.  The chips and salsa ($3.75) we ordered at the beginning had much better salsa.

While we did not come during happy hour, I did get a small strawberry margarita.  It was one of the best flavored margaritas I have had, and the price was reasonable.  The happy hour specials are killer, though, if you want a drink.

The atmosphere is really loud, especially if you are on the floor.  The balcony area is quieter, but if you are coming to watch a game on TV, make sure to sit on the floor since you cannot see the TVs from the balcony.  The service is nothing more than adequate, but it is fine for a relaxed dinner.

Overall, I am ready to reincorporate Mad Mex into my life."}
{"text":"Lots of vegan options from vegan ranch, daiya cheese, tofutti sour cream, tofu, portobello and seitan. Staff is always friendly and intelligent on the menu."}
{"text":"Chips and salsa are not on the house, but the chips and guacamole are worth the nominal charge.  Chicken soft shell tacos were fantastic.  Service took long however."}
{"text":"Stopped in after a meeting,  thought about reading the paper, then the lights were lowered to kinda dark.  Decided to get my food to go.  Wait staff, Emily, was very sweet and understanding.   She made awesome recommendations, too.  If the food is as unexpectedly superior as the service provided by Emily, I will most definitely update this review."}
{"text":"Mad Mex is a solid choice for drinks and dinner with friends or family. The environment is fun and margaritas are good and strong. They also have a nice draft beer selection as well as tequila choices.  Burritos and salads are very good, along with the pic a dip a for an appetizer.  Chips and salsa are plentiful."}
{"text":"Umm... NO, Mad Mex, you're not mad and you're not Mexican. You're happy. And you're Mexi-Americano ( pronounced Meh - HE - Americano  [ Rrrrroll the \"R\" - for those at Mad Mex Corporate who don't speak/read Spanish]).... It's kinda like Chi Chi's, Taco Bell, and you're favorite modern & loud (not hip) club rolled up into one ~ Like, um, in a Burrito?

I mean, I had a good time there 'cause I could have fun in a box. And the food was totally better than Chi Chi's or Taco Bell (And I'm a huge 'run for the border' dude, seriously), but shit, my beloved Mexican friends in Chicago woulda' got a good chuckle outta the place. I can hear 'em now... Ohhh, muy authentico! Muy caliente'! HA! Then again, been here six weeks and still haven't run into a Mexican ( wish I did so I could get a tip 'cause I know somebody's cookin' up some legit Carnita's somewhere in town. 

Sorry to be so harsh... Its really not bad. I enjoyed the taste of my Cali-American taco. I would have had another but they thought just 2 tiny tacos was enough for me. Server was really friendly and was obviously busting her ass ~ running like a chicken with head cut off 'cause the MAD manager's think that servers should handle 20 some tables with grace ~ Somehow she actually did get us stuff in a fairly timely manner but I could tell others around me were rubbernecking for drinks/food and she was just a bit flippant when I asked for my Margarita on the ROCKS to not be frozen.

I promise not to be a dick on my next review."}
{"text":"The people that work at this location are awesome! They are always having such a fun time at work and that truly shows! I'm from Texas and extremely critical of Mexican food (they're food is okay not great but hey we are in Pittsburgh) but I like going to the bar grabbing a drink watching the Buckos and chatting with the staff!"}
{"text":"This is the 4th Mad Mex I've been to in PA. This one was definitely the nicest I've seen. It's big and open and very nicely decorated. The bartender, Matthew, was absolutely wonderful. He was friendly, funny and really on the ball with our order. 

The booze is expensive, $6 or more for most beers. The food is good but also pretty expensive, though you do get large portions. The Southwestern wings are one of the best things I've ever eaten!"}
{"text":"I am always happy to go to Mad Mex for drinks. The margaritas come in fun flavors, and you can't beat the prices after 10pm.  I have not ever been there for a meal, but I do feel pretty strongly about one thing: chips and salsa should be free. If not for the fact that they make you buy chips and salsa, I would find it to be a perfect pseudo-Mexican bar experience."}
{"text":"Location, Location, Location.  Any other Mad Mex would get 4 stars, but this one gets 5 because it has two levels, a large bar and is so much more spacious than any other one I've been to.  It gets a great, fun crowd too. 

My favorite menu item is the Black Beanie quesadilla.  Something about the blend of spicy goodness and the sweet from the pineapple is absolutely perfect.  I also recommend the nachos.  The chicken nachos are fully loaded with chicken, guac, sour cream, jalapenos, cheese, beans and salsa.  It's a huge serving and could be a meal in itself.  Hands down, best nachos I've ever had and great to share with a group.  I also recommend doing the three salsa/dip deal as an appetizer.  The queso, guac, regular salsa and the pineapple habanero are quite tasty.  The pineapple one is really hot though so don't say I didn't warn you.

Now, I know everyone goes here for the margaritas which are a steal during happy hour but I've recently tried the red sangria and was delighted.  It's the perfect mix of sweet and dry and while I don't know the caloric intake, it has to be less calories than the big azz margaritas which are rumored to be over 800 calories."}
{"text":"Yumm, I always enjoy Mad Mex but I've never been to the Shadyside  location. We ran into a detour right on highland avenue & almost gave up. I'm glad we didn't though! I enjoyed this location so much. I always liked the oakland one despite size but this one had so much more space & had a great airy vibe, not to mention the cool painting and decor. The service was pleasing and the food was fresh & hot."}
{"text":"Would give more stars if the service was better. Waited 15 minutes for a drink refill. Waited 20 minutes just to pay the bill. 

Had the chicken chimi and that was great although the sauce on top threw me off since it tasted like Italian pasta sauce. Still good though. The potato taquitos were great too. Service wasn't bad enough to keep me away, just hoping for a different server next time. 

Was a slow lunch service by the way."}
{"text":"Like many, I was psyched for the opening of this location and I think the space is grand compared to the others I've been to. Sure, it's loud and proud, like the others, but it also features the many vegan options that make Mad Mex a pioneer in the Pgh area dining scene. Really, If it weren't for the vegan food (of inconsistent quality), I'd avoid the (obnoxious) Mad Mex atmosphere at all costs. 

But since they have discontinued the half priced food after 11pm at this location, the costs to avoid have increased. In other words, WTF. This review has been discounted by 50% to reflect my disappointment."}
{"text":"So I've been to 4 of the 5 Mad Mex' in Pittsburgh and of those I would say that the Shadyside Location is probably the best. First off it's the only Location that is open until 2am, 7 nights a week, which in a city with very few late night dining options is a huge plus. The location itself is very hip and fun, and being in a somewhat stuffy part of town it doesn't feel uppity or pretentious. I find the service at this location to be slightly better than others that I've been too, and also the food is a little more consistent. However, even though the consistency is there, overall the food is just slightly above average. Everything I've had here has been good, but it strikes me as 'Pittsburgh Mexican Food, before Pittsburgh had Good Mexican Food.' If you Love tacos, these are good, but you can find better. If you want authentic, this isn't for you. If you want a good burrito, I honestly prefer Chipotle to Mad Mex. But, if you like craft beer and a good sipping tequila, while you munch on tasty, juicy chicken wings in anticipation of your consistently above average entrees. Than you could do a lot worse than this Mad Mex. Lastly, I'm not a big dessert guy, but you're gonna want to try the Nutella Stuffed Churros. In my opinion they are the most standout item on the menu."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times, though it's been awhile.  The reason it's been awhile is because nothing I've ordered here has wowed me.

Both times I've been here, I've come with a group during happy hour.  I don't recall what I ordered the first time, but the second time, I ordered the fish tacos.  They were disappointing--the fish didn't seem very fresh, and its flavor was drowned out by the salsa.  The refried beans and rice that came with it were pretty nondescript, as well.  I don't recall much about the chips, so they must not have struck me as particularly tasty.

The margaritas, on the other hand, were pretty good.  I personally don't have the alcohol tolerance for the Big Azz margarita, so I went with the smaller ones both times.  I believe I ordered the strawberry once and the mango once, and they were both decent.

Be forewarned that it's extremely crowded during happy hour, and that the noise level is extremely loud.  If I came here again, I'd skip the food and would try to sit at the bar and order chips and a margarita.  If I came around Thanksgiving, I might try the gobblerito, however, since this seems to be a popular option."}
{"text":"It's Mad Mex. If you've been living in Pittsburgh for at least a month or so, you probably know what you're getting into already. Although this location can't quite rival the spacious Mad Mex Happy Valley that I grew accustomed to in college, it's still pretty impressive with a large bar and lots of tables, and the open garage door makes up for the lack of patio and provides for awesome people watching. The absolute best part though is that it's virtually across the street from my apartment! So I mean, I'd probably come here even if it was sub-par...(please don't stalk me, yelpers...haha)

For anyone who's not familiar with Mad Mex...the food is nothing to rave about. Typical Tex Mex that tends to taste better after a few drinks (especially the hugeeee plate of nachos). Their wings, surprisingly, are excellent and in my opinion the standout of the menu (get bleu cheese, not ranch. their bleu cheese is addictive). Mostly though, I come here for the margarita special. Doesn't everyone? I get really excited about the monthly flavors. My favorite is honeydew...June can't come soon enough! And if you're not in the mood for tequila, the beer list is pretty solid.

It wouldn't be on my list of considerations for dinner, but I'd definitely recommend it for a place to chill, talk, and drink a little (or a lot) more than you planned to."}
{"text":"The tofu tacos are my favorite. I also love their salads. They are huge though, so be forewarned- you might be better off splitting a salad. I don't think I've ever had a dish here that wasn't good. Not authentic Mex but the food is consistently good."}
{"text":"This is by far the best mad mex in the area. I've gone here about three times and have had excellent service each time. I love their wingeritos and the endless nachos are truly the best as you wait for your food. One waiter, Max was really enthusiastic and helpful in helping us to order our food"}
{"text":"Recently went to this Mad Mex location, and after going I may never go back. Encountered the rudest waitress. She had absolutely no concern for myself or the 2 other friends I was joined with. I got up to go to the restroom and she rolled her eyes. Honestly unbelievable. But nothing can - or will - top the piece of chewed gum i found in my burrito ordered here. Really disappointed?."}
{"text":"I was drawn in by the outdoor seating on a beautiful Spring day and was pushed out by average food & not so stellar service.

I was walking in Shadyside one afternoon and saw the outdoor seating with the garage windows up and decided it looked poppin enough to give it a try. I sat at the bar since I was alone & didn't want to take up a table.  It took about 5 minutes for the bartender to actually acknowledge a human sat down because she was chatting with fellow server. 

The chips come from a bag & are stale af. The salsa they give you is dry & not Pico dry but just soggy. The margaritas are average AT BEST. 

The only redeeming quality is the pretty great beers on tap. I don't typically crave mediocrity and stale chips so I don't foresee myself coming back."}
{"text":"Mad Mex is a great place for some affordable Tex-Mex eats, yummy yummy margaritas, and a great time with a group.  It's a place that I like to go for a casual meet-up for drinks.  If you're at a table for an appetizer and a drink or two, the wait staff is not too pushy to get you to order a million things.  

I love their margaritas.  And for a $5-$7 a drink anyone who complains should probably reassess their lives.  

One of my go-tos are the mahi-mahi fish tacos.  You get so much fish.  Two nights ago, my friend and I ordered waffle fries and tacos.  I was pretty stuffed after the fries (that come with free cheese and ranch) that I had to take my tacos to go.  You get sooooo much food!  And there are so many great options for tacos, quesadillas, burritos, salads and more.  They also have pretty good guac at a decent price too.  For more choices than a place like Chipotle (where you run the risk of getting sick) and tacos that are more of a value than a certain trendy taco place in town... Mad Mex is a really solid choice for food, environment, and drinks."}
{"text":"Got a burrito with carnitas.  Excellent.  Atmosphere was cool. Playoff hockey going on.  The food was really good my waiter was just a little slow with our bill and i was in a hurry at the time.  But other than that i would return and recommend"}
{"text":"The food is very average. I would give it another star if the food and drink prices didn't seem to be double what they should be for the quality you receive.  I would go elsewhere for good Mexican food. I only eat if I am not expecting good quality food and need a quick place to meet a friend."}
{"text":"Must say that we only went here for drinks one afternoon and were pleasantly surprised by the beer selection, the service and most of all their jalepeno margarita - oh so delicious! We ordered the guac and chips which were standard, good and satisfying. Hoping to return for a meal and many more margaritas someday."}
{"text":"1-star is putting it lightly. They're lucky 1 is required. My waiter was horrible, to put it lightly. He spilled a drink on me, didn't clea it up or even bring extra napkins so I could take care of it myself. He brought my brother-in-law a half empty soda, charged us full price. Charged us for the drink he spilled on me. My sister ate one bite of her meal and wanted to send it back but the waiter was no where to be found until ::surprise:: the check was ready to be given. He took it out of our hands so quickly, and after about 5 minutes and not having brought our cards back to us, we spoke to the manager. The waiter was confused as to why we asked for the manager. He didn't think he did anything wrong! Insanity. The manager offered us free entree cards and we declined. Never returning."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a whim right after work. I was just about dying of hunger and thirst (yes, I'm being dramatic). I got a table right away and was waiting on my coworker. Ten minutes later I still didn't get greeted by my waitress. She gave waters and tooks orders for people that came after me. I got so flustered and thirsty, I stood up and just walked over to the bar. The Bartender Sam, who is incredibly sweet, immediately took my order and gave me a water.

He was really sorry about what happened and gave us some complimentary chips and guac, AND a coffee. I ordered the angry hippie burrito, which had portobellos, beans, spinach, rice, cheese and tomatoes. I got both sour cream and more guac on the side. I also ordered an appetizer of the Pennsyltucky fried tofu. The mix of the sauce, nuts and sprouts are so good! A must try for vegetarians and non-vegetarians both! The burrito was also very tasty. Not a super intense flavor, but you can easily add your own salsas/hot sauces etc to spice it up. I appreciated the lack of spice to be quite honest. 

All in all, still a good experience. They had a lot of great beers and of course, margaritas."}
{"text":"You get what you expect here...dirty delicious indigestion inducing Tex Mex! Love me some Tex Mex food covered in cheese occasionally, and this is where I like to go for that. Fun atmosphere, tasty food, fair prices, generous amounts, what's not to like. Please bring any digestion aides if you're prone to that, you'll thank me later."}
{"text":"The service is quick and friendly. The food is delicious. We go here because this is the only Mad Mex so far that has seitan wings. They're not as good as Double Wide Grill's but they're good. They're also half off as the rest of the wings on happy hour."}
{"text":"Yeah, the taco salad isn't so great. It won't prevent me from coming again...just making a note of that for next time."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food.  Very  nice service with superb decor. Enchiladas here are mouth watering as is the tortilla soup. Their portions are large. I could not finish one. Have been there multiple times. They have happy hours late in the night. Go, try at least once. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is one of our go-to spots. Love the beer selection here! The wings are delicious and the pick a dippa is awesome- the guacamole and habanero pineapple salsa are two of our favorites. The carnitas burrito, black bean quesadilla, chicken torta, and California salad are some of my favorites. Wait can sometimes be long on weekends. Speaking of weekends we like the Sunday brunch too. The chorizo tacos are yummy and I always get the heuvos rancheros. The breakfast potatoes are good. I always get a screwdriver to drink and it's so tasty."}
{"text":"Mad Mex is always consistently good. Tried the tomatillo-avocado salsa with our chips today. Delicious with a pronounced lime flavor and a little heat. The carnitas burrito was tasty and I really like the blue cornbread.
Our server, Joe, took good care of us, but when he found out why we were there, he went the extra mile. My wife and I had our first date, 12 years ago to the day, at the Oakland location. So, once we had finished our meal, Joe came by with a menu and informed us that dessert was on the house. Sopapillas, long weekend style, for the win. Thank you Joe, and Mad Mex!"}
{"text":"Went for Cinco de Mayo and waited about an hour, which was much shorter than the other Mexican restaurants in Shadyside/Lawrenceville. Luckily there's a little bar called the Hideaway right next door so we went over there. 

The waitress was great! She was attentive, kind, and informative. She didn't seem phased by the crowds or drunk people. 

I ordered the barbacoa tacos and they were okay but not great (rating 3). The meat taste a bit too much like pot roast. The rice was extremely bland and dry (rating 1) the fire roasted salsa (rating 4) and guacamole (rating 5) were both fantastic. 

I would come back for apps and drinks but probably not for dinner!"}
{"text":"I decided to meet a friend for an evening gab fest and since the new location opened I hadn't had the chance to check it out. Faux mexican food is not something I tolerate well and after trying to like the food at Mad Mex it was always a big fail for me. Chips and Salsa are about all I can handle here. IMO the food has way too many chillis in the sauces so there is a lack of seasoning because all I can taste is the heat. I am a big fan of spicy food but this is different.

Location, location, location! This place was filled to the brim with the Shadyside crowd! Highland ave has all sorts of little furniture stores and an art gallery to window shop at while walking up. 

Luckily I had already eaten before so I wasn't hungry. Just because the food doesn't do it for me, that doesn't mean they can't get me in the door with their Giant margaritas and Happy hour specials! Blue salt and a little too sweet but oh so refreshing after a long day!  I asked the bartender if it was always so busy and she said since they opened they are \"slammed\" every night. Stupendous people watching! 

The best part about this new spot is that it will have a rooftop deck! I'm so excited and so close to my house! My group will be regulars, I can guarantee. I bet Cinco de Mayo will be a crazy time! Viva la Vida!"}
{"text":"Looks and sounds like a douchey place -- but the Tex-Mex was very good and the craft beer selection was good.  And it's open late!  If you can get around the clientele and the loud music, it's a solid option."}
{"text":"I love fish tacos and I really like the fish tacos here. They are at a good price and they are tasty! They have a happy hour and are known for their margaritas. I love Mad Mex. Most recently, I got the carnitas burrito and I was in heaven. The burrito itself was tasty and the plate looked very nice. I took a picture of it. The cornbread it came with on the side was really really good. I couldn't get enough! The other side additions (guacamole, salsa, and coleslaw) were good and added to the dish as well. They have a good draft list too. I will definitely be back again soon. Only negative is I ordered takeout once and I think the order got messed up. Anyways, great place. I will continue to enjoy Mad Mex to satisfy my Mexican food cravings!"}
{"text":"Best mad mex in Pittsburgh! I go here way too often. The bar tenders are alert, food never disappoints and don't even get me started on the beer selection!!"}
{"text":"I love, love, love Mad Mex and I've been to this location as well as the Oakland, Greentree, McKnight, and Monroeville locations. They always consistently deliver me delicious food. Albeit, I ALWAYS get the same thing. I'm a big fan of the wingo-rrito or the wing (boneless) wrap. And I always get the Southwestern sauce, if you don't like cilantro, then don't get this sauce. Yummy! 

As an appetizer, I enjoy the picka-dippa especially with a group of people. I'm a big fan of the black bean dip, the XX cheese dip and then not really picky about the 3rd choice for the dip. 

Of course you can't go to MadMex without indulging in a margarita. This time around I tried the Apple Cider margarita which I thought was tasty, but not as tasty as my usual choice Mango. The Apple Cider margarita did taste sorta like apple sauce, but cinnamony apple sauce with a bit of a kick aka tequila. 

The Shades Mad Mex is always busy no matter when I go, but at least it's more spacious then the Oakland and McKnight locations."}
{"text":"We had an amazing evening here. This was our first time at mad mex, and we will be back many more times. We ordered some nachos, and a burrito. For the price we paid, we got huge portions, and their quality was great! The homemade chips and guacamole on the nachos stood out, and the burrito was delicious. This is one of the first times we could not finish our food, and had to take some home. 

The setting was awesome with various artworks on the walls and Spanish decor all around. The service was great, and the atmosphere made me feel like I was in another city. I would highly recommend if you have never had their food or drinks!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Oakland Mad Mex many a time in my wall-sittin' youth. Anyone who knows me even a little knows my unabashed love for all food Mexican.

This morning my bf and I awaited 11am like kids waiting for Gift-mas morning. Promptly at 11am we started our brisk walk from Bloomfield to the new(er) Shadyside Mad Mex. 

The day twas lovely and once I saw that cactus shaped cigarette depository and those big ominous doors I knew I had arrived at Mexican food brunch heaven.

Walking in it is HUGE compared to at least the Oakland location. There are some seriously beautiful paintings and a really eye catching mural. The ceilings are high and the front is windows to allow some natural light in too.

Our waiter came immediately over to our table after our equally attentive hostess sat us. He was a little over the top, but likable and funny. We had our chips and salsa/guac and Big Azz margarita's on the rocks by the time I came back from the restroom and our long awaited Gobbleritos not long after.

I realize we were there at 11:30am on a Sunday morning so we're in a near empty restaurant at the start of everyone's shift, but honestly that's how I roll. I like trying something new when I won't be annoyed by the other patrons.

The drinks weren't quite as strong as I remember them being, but the Gobblerito's were delicious and I took half of mine home. My only real issue with the food was that while the salsa was so chunky and dense, the chips were absolutely not strong enough to dig any out. They were fine with the guac but would just break apart in the salsa. 

Honestly, if that's the only bad thing, then this place is winning for sure. I can't wait to stop back and try something else."}
{"text":"There's usually a 10% chance the food here is good-the menu is obviously too big for the kitchen to handle. Easily one of the most over hyped garbage \"mexican\" joints in Pburgh."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for margaritas and guacamole, and frequenting Mad Mex is one of my favorite pastimes from my college days at Pitt. Came here for dinner a couple weeks ago and the food and margaritas were just as I remembered. I had a mango margarita and my favorite meal, the Mahi-Mahi salad. Both were delicious and filling. 

It wasn't very busy so we were seated right away and the waiter was very attentive. 

Mad Mex is still one of my favorite places to eat whenever I'm in Pittsburgh :-)"}
{"text":"I went for lunch last week....food was average.....service was terrible....I ordered hot wings...I had to ask for refills on my drinks.  When it was check time, I literally had to hunt my waitress down."}
{"text":"A little disappointed with MMSS today with the Shrimp n' FunGuy Taquitos as it looked as if they had been made with Prince Albert Shrimp in a Can. The ensalada de casa was, as usual, delightful and Brandon loved his MM Burrito. Usually the experience is consistently good, it was just today that it was a relatively large let down. Oh, and the server never found out if pumpkin beer was on tap yet.

UPDATE: Bill from MMSS sent some coups for some makeup goodness and I have to say, \"Thank you!\" We stopped in a couple of nights ago and had a delightful time! The server was pleasant and her suggestions were excellent! The Gobblerito is so much and so good!"}
{"text":"I ate here yesterday for lunch with a dining companion.  The decor of the restaurant was unique with many different wall paintings and oddities but probably familiar to those who have ever been to a Mad Mex restaurant before.  Upon sitting down I noticed that they had a nice beer list but did not order any due to it being lunch on a Sunday afternoon.

For lunch I ordered the Wing-A-Rito burrito with insane buffalo sauce while my dining companion had the Thai Curry burrito.  My burrito was comprised of rice, cheese, beans, chicken and the buffalo sauce which did not disappoint.  It was hotter than most sauces that I have ordered yet still had a good solid taste to it.  It was served with a side of salsa which was all that was left on my plate whenever I had finished.  My dining companions burrito also tasted good and did remind me of a nice Thai curry dish.  It was topped with bean sprouts and came with a side of slaw that was vinegar based.  Overall we were both very satisfied with our meals and nothing was left except for the salsa whenever we were done.

The bottom line for me is that I will definitely be back to a Mad Mex in the future.  They have not only a wonderful selection of Margaritas and beer but the food is good and does not lighten the wallet too much."}
{"text":"Love the margaritas! And my bf loves the beer selection, friends don't let friends drink bad beer"}
{"text":"Let's just say when people ask me (Miss Yelp! Elite) what my favorite Pittsburgh restaurant is I don't hesitate to say Mad Mex.  In fact, Mad Mex has been my favorite for a good twenty years when the Atwood Street location in Oakland was the only one.  Now you can find a Mad Mex in several locations, and the one I'm reviewing is for the Shady Avenue, Shadyside, spot.
I can't rave enough on the layout and design of this space.  Large bar in the middle with high tops surrounding it, huge garage door wall that is open as soon as the weather beats 60 degrees, sidewalk seating, inside booths, and a loft area with addition seating so you can peer down at all the cool kids hanging at the bar.  Phenomenal Mexican artwork largely displayed on the wall, awesome mason jars with green lights hung by rope decorating the bar and awesome wooden beams and floors.  You want to feel like you've gone somewhere cool?  Then come inside and enjoy.
I've ordered several different options from the menu - favorites being the fried tofu appetizer, the \"pick-a-dilla\" dips and tortilla (pick three dips - and always make guacamole one of those choices!), the Mad Mex Burrito, and the shrimp quesadillas.  All a ten on the yum-o scale.
Don't even get me started on their margaritas.  They're all delicious and the flavors change often with the seasons. For example, come in the fall and order an apple cider margarita, or stop by in the summer for a blackberry margarita...you get the drift.  
Excellent selection of craft brews on tap including killer IPA options.  And, when the clock strikes fall, you can get Pumking on tap.  Hail Mad Mex!"}
{"text":"Four years ago, this Mad Mex was one of the first local restaurants we had tried in Pittsburgh while family was in town. The service had been mediocre, the food was underwhelming, and the margaritas were poor. My margarita was so terrible that I sent it back. (That's the one and only time that I have ever sent a drink back.) I avoided eating at Mad Mex for two years until I gave the Monroeville location a try. After drinking and dining at the Monroeville location multiple times over the last couple years, I fell in love with this local Mexican chain.  

While in the middle of some bar hopping last night, my group and I made Mad Mex our last stop. I had such high hopes after our Monroeville experience... but I was disappointed yet again. We started with appetizers which were pretty good. However, our waitress was not the nicest. We arrived at 9:30, and several people at the table ordered beer while I anxiously waited for the Big Azz Margarita special to begin at 10:00. At 9:58, I asked the waitress if it was 10:00 yet, and she curtly answered \"no\" and walked away, not returning for at least 10-15 minutes. I was so frustrated by her that none of us ordered margaritas, and we all ended up leaving the restaurant shortly after. 

My advice would be to drive out to the suburbs and dine at the Mad Mex in Monroeville, where I have consistently had a completely opposite experience."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Mad Mex location, especially in the summertime, sitting in a window booth. It's usually hard to get on a nice day, but if you're willing and have the time to wait, I think it's worth it! It's a pretty noisy place, so be willing to talk over clanging glass, other loud voices and TVs to be heard, but it's a fun place to go with a group. I'm a vegetarian so I love the Happy Hippy quesadilla. Never disappoints. Lots of veggies, perfect amount of cheese. I only wish the guac serving was more generous (I usually always have to request an extra side)."}
{"text":"I looooove Mexican food. Burritos, tacos, you name it. I'll eat it all! So it doesn't come to a surprise that Mad Mex is something I'm a fan of. We ordered takeout from this location last week and the food was great! 

I ordered the Chicken Fajita Burrito which consisted of chicken, beans, rice, lettuce, tomato, peppers and sour cream. Yum! It wasn't anything that made me go crazy,, but consistent to what I'd imagined. What left me most impressed, however, was the size of the burrito. It was freakin' huge! It pretty much took up the entire take-out container. For $10, I thought they could have thrown in some chips or something, but all in all, a great meal! 

They do a great job at packing their take-out orders as well. Everything was neat and situated well with no room for any spills or accidents. They even pack things like lettuce, tomato and cheese separately for things like tacos so you can put on as much as you'd like. 

Good service and good food. It was must first time eating from Mad Mex in years and I'll definitely return after my last visit."}
{"text":"This place never fails to amaze
I've tried burritos, enchiladas, tacos, quesadillas here and all are very filling and tasty! One odd time the chicken in the burrito happened to be a dry, but that isn't stopping me from coming back
The standout dish is the Nacho Grande. This never lasts on our table for more than 2 minutes

Service is also excellent, always cheerful and quick"}
{"text":"Funky decor, low lights, lively bar. Delicious Mexican food. I had been eating poorly the previous days, so I ordered a kale with autumn veggies salad with chicken. It was huge and involved some other greens so it wasn't too rough as kale can be. We got the trio of dips. Watch out for the queso if you don't like spicy. I happen to like spicy. Definitely caters to vegetarians and special needs eaters. Tofu is an option. I ordered a tortilla soup, but they forgot it. Still, the service was pretty good -- attentive. This restaurant is part of a small chain which also includes Kaya, at which I ate the night before. Pretty happy with both places. The only thing I didn't like was that I didn't see if corn tortillas were offered, which I prefer 99% of the time."}
{"text":"Bland and insultingly overpriced.

If you're looking for anything remotely close to Tex-Mex, this is not the place; try your luck at Emiliano's (South Side) or Gran Agave (Bloomfield/Waterfront).

If you're looking for drinks, just go to Buffalo Blues next door."}
{"text":"They have REALLY good wings (especially the southwest and san francisco styles ones!)! I gotta say, the Atwood location makes their wings slightly better than the Shadyside location, but overall, both locations make DELICIOUS wings! Will come back!"}
{"text":"Come for the margs, stay for the apps!Chain restaurants don't usually speak to me, but there's a special place in my heart for Mad Mex.

My favorite time to visit Mad Mex is for Happy Hour and their deliciously flavored margaritas. These usually change monthly and during the summer they had a Peach flavor which was amazing.

I've had some hit and miss experiences with dinners here so I usually stick with a variety of apps to share amongst the table. For example the last time I ordered a meal, a quesadilla, there was literally no cheese on it. It's a quesadilla! However, their apps make up for this large oversight, especially their guac which has just the right amount of kick to it."}
{"text":"I hate Mexican food but I love Mad Mex. The food here is slightly more expensive than your typical Mexican restaurant, but the quality more than accounts for this. My only complaint is the volume of the music in the restaurant. It is incredibly loud and makes it hard to hear, especially when the restaurant is packed."}
{"text":"I give my experience here two stars.. Neither of the meals paid for were enjoyable, I also have to say that the servers are also not on their game, careless and slow."}
{"text":"Holy cow. Don't come here. The food itself was 2 stars. Service is unapologetically aweful.  The place was almost empty, and it was still all they could do to deliver our food 40minutes after ordering, and without apology. Had to flag down our server for everything. It was like he didn't want to be here. And neither do we now. It was so bad I don't even want to write about it. Just don't come here."}
{"text":"Food is consistently hot, fresh, and delicious, and I love that there is so much variety on the menu.  There are lots of vegetarian and vegan options and tasty margaritas.  Love eating there in the spring and summer when the windows are open.  Just wish it weren't so crowded."}
{"text":"I moved to Pittsburgh from the Southwest and have not yet found any decent Mexican food. While I was wary of Mad Mex due to reading reviews, some coworkers insisted that I try it anyway and spoke highly of it, so I did. We ordered nachos and a carnitas burrito. The nachos were just not made well, structurally speaking. They were big and had lots of toppings, but the cheese wasn't distributed evenly at all, and wasn't a nice melty cheese sauce. It was also overcooked so it was just kind of like dried cheese on some chips with lots of cheese-less chips. The other toppings were okay but nothing amazing. The burrito was really sad. It looked like a square on the plate, not like any burrito I've ever seen before. The filling was almost entirely rice, which was okay tasting by itself, but there was way too much in the burrito. The carnitas were extremely salty to the point that I didn't even finish the meat. There were a few trace amounts of green in the bottom of the tortilla (I guess that was the advertised \"green chile\"), but they had almost no flavor or spice so it was hard to distinguish them. On the side was a flavorless pico de gallo and slaw, and some cornbread that was really mushy in the middle (undercooked). Overall, not impressed and not going back unless it's just for drinks."}
{"text":"I'll preface this by saying I'm a vegan, so my love for this place is probably higher than others because I LOVE THAT THEY HAVE MULTIPLE OPTIONS FOR ME! I really love a restaurant that takes into account other people's dietary needs and Mad Mex really does. They even have a vegan dessert on the menu now! My fiancé and I went here over the weekend. I had the crispy tofu tacos-- they were out of this world good! My blackberry rhubarb frozen margarita was good, but my man's frozen mango one was better. I'll get that instead the next time I'm there. This place is ALWAYS slamming busy every time we go-- I think to myself every time I walk in, \"Man, they must be raking in some serious dough!\" I bet they are! The decor doesn't pretend to be authentically Mexican and is really fun. If I had kids, this is someplace I would feel comfortable bringing them-- both because it would be appropriate and I feel like there's something on the menu for everyone."}
{"text":"While this is better than their Oakland branch, I'm still not convinced by their food. It's tasty but not that great. For the price you pay for it, it's not worth going to unless you go during their specials. 
This place is a lot bigger and a lot nicer than the one in Oakland which I'm guessing was geared toward a different demographic. 
I've never had anything here that was truly and epically amazing."}
{"text":"Went with some friend after a tough semester for some drinks. Great atmosphere, service was awesome, drinks were reasonable, and the burritos are big enough to feed a small army. I paid $5 per beer (not too shabby) and $10 for the burrito.  I ordered the spicy burrito and that's really all it was...lots of spice and not enough other flavors.  I'd go again for apps and drinks but I would skip the food.  Peace!"}
{"text":"On a Friday night around 6 the wait was 15 minutes but we were called after about 5 minutes after ordering a round of drinks at the bar. I had a Dark Horse Tres Blueberry Stout and was content. Who doesn't like blewbz? After sitting down at our table I noticed the 22 oz Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA special for...wait...$5. Face sufficiently melted, I ordered that next and continued to do so.

My steak Mad Mex burrito was stupendous and a master sculptor managed to somehow wrap it into a cube instead of the standard cylinder, thus requiring me to get all dexterous with my fork y knife. 

Others had the San Fransisco wings (reported to be good but sugary) and grilled steak tacos (two opposable thumbs up), white sangria, and blackberry margaritas with a floater. What's a floater, you ask? I'll leave this one up to your imagination. 

Due to the nice weather the large garage door style windows were opened up and by chance we happened to be sitting next to one. After signing our checks, I definitely departed through said opening."}
{"text":"You wont find a better spot for Tex Mex in Pittsburgh. This location especially is outstanding, you can sit right in the open window or outside on the sidewalk or upstairs tucked away in a corner whatever you prefer. Great for drinks, dinner, or even brunch. Go now."}
{"text":"Went here with a large group (about 30 people) so we sat upstairs. For that many people, we took the option of the buffet-style. The chips and salsa was great, along with the other type of dips. I received a special meal being vegan (grilled portabella) which was excellent as I made a fajita with the vegetables on the buffet. 

The atmosphere and food was excellent. My only negative was the service. Because of that many people the 2 servers were not able to keep up with drink orders, so-much-so that I never received one other than water, which I got myself. Good thing I no longer drink or I would have thrown a Tequila Fit. 

I would go back, with a much smaller group of 1."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about Mad Mex.  I get really excited about going there, but the food always falls a notch short of my expectations.  But then, a few weeks or months later, I make plans to go back and I get all pumped up about it....and then the food is mediocre.  I guess I just have selective memory about Mad Mex - all I remember is the fun atmosphere and the chance to have margaritas with friends, and I block out the disappointing food.

Yesterday was my first time at this Mad Mex.  It was during the crazy heat wave, and I went with a big group of girls around 6 pm for Happy Hour.  And....the power was out.  Not on the whole block, just at Mad Mex.  Maybe their AC was cranked up so high they blew a fuse?  One of the girls in our group said this actually happened the last time she was at this location - in May - so apparently it's more than a one-time thing.

Lots of people were leaving, since the power was out, but we actually decided to go ahead and get a table since there was no wait!  I guarantee you there would be a wait normally, but if you are lucky enough to go when there's a power outage, you get seated immediately!  The big windows provided enough light to see, and it was a bit humid in there but not too bad.  The bar was still open, so we got margaritas ($7 for a \"Big Azz\" 22 oz) and chips and salsa.  The margarita was really tasty, but not strong at all.  If I'm getting a 22 oz margarita, I want to feel tipsy - especially on an empty stomach - but I barely got a buzz with this one.  Boo!  Maybe their tequila bottle runs on electricity and was experiencing the power shortage too.

The chips and dips were great, though.  Yummy, fresh guacamole....and the pineapple-habanero salsa was DELISH.  I could eat that all day.  It was sort of thin, with a soupy consistency, but my goodness was it yummy.  Sweet and fruity, with a huge spice kick!  I will definitely get that next time, because who am I kidding - I'll be back again, I'm sure.

After about 45 minutes, the lights came back on!  Yaaaaaay!  So we got to order food.  I was pretty full on chips, so I just got a bowl of chickpea chili.  It was okay....really not that great.  It was super thin, and salty, with some chickpeas and cheese floating around in it.  It wasn't very strongly flavored, not very gourmet, not very special.  It was okay to dip chips in, but it was nothing I'd bother ordering again.  I just got it because it's one of the only things on the menu that doesn't have like, a thousand calories.  I'm really not a calorie-counter usually, but I try not to eat my entire days worth of calories in one sitting, if I can help it.

The atmosphere is fun, a little noisy, but you can hear your friends.  I love the big windows, and this location is much more light and spacious than the evil Oakland location.  I think though, this place is not worth the hype.  With the decor and the crowds, you think \"I'm having fun!\"  But if you stop for a minute and notice what you're actually eating or drinking, you realize that it's okay, but not really worth the excitement.  But the spirit of the place is kind of addicting - seriously, if somebody asked me to go back tomorrow, I'd totally do it.  They've got a hold on me!"}
{"text":"Just when I thought I couldn't love Mad Mex anymore then I already did, I discovered the shady side location offered brunch!! I got the huevos rancheros with a Bloody Mary. I would not recommend the Bloody Mary because it tasted a little watered down. The meal on the other hand was probably the best huevos rancheros I've ever had. It had a nice kick to it and it had plenty of toppings and who doesn't love toppings?!

I would also like to add that I love the set up of this Mad Mex. I've been to multiple locations but none are as open as this one. It makes the restaurant appear much bigger and it allows for natural light to get in. The other locations feel so small and dark."}
{"text":"This is a nice location, particularly when the doors are open during fair weather. The bar can be lively, and the drinks are pretty standard. I also like the guacamole. Beyond all that however, the food is so tasteless and boring that all reference to \"Mexican\" should be removed entirely. Change the name from \"Mad Mex\" to \"Mad Moore\" (as in Dinty Moore stew) and you'd have a more accurate description of the flavors inside."}
{"text":"Mad Mex. I'll tell you what I like - the portion sizes. I was stuffed when I left this place. But it is one of those places where if you want a lot of food but are kind of indifferent regarding its standoutishness, then I would go to Mad Mex. I don't think it's better than Chipotle. There's no way I would pay full price for their meals like their dinner menu lays out. There's just no way. I would pay the lunch price and think, eh, this is still a little over valued considering I need to tip a server. But $8.75 for a massive burrito and a cup of soup or salad . . . I can't really complain. 

Our server here really wasn't great. At one point he left for like 30 minutes. I was getting worried about his well being as ours was deteriorating. I want to spend 40 minutes eating at a place like this, tops. Maybe you think I'm fussy - that's okay. We were here for 1hr 10min. Thank goodness we had no immediate plans! 

The decor was nice! That's what made our long stay bearable (I'm just being hyperbolic). Ceilings are very high and I just enjoyed the vibe in this place! 

I got a burrito and maybe everything would've been different had I gotten my friend's recommendation of fajitas. But that burrito is the place's #1 best seller . . . 
 
The guac was a bit runny, and those of you who love some good gauc, that burned you reading that. You know what I'm talking about. It hurt me too. 

I won't rush back to Mad Mex. It's popular and maybe so for other reasons other than the things I ordered. And that's cool. But Chipotle is right down the street . . . Dare I say better quality? Cheaper prices? Quicker experience? 

I might."}
{"text":"Overview:
Mad Mex is a popular, dimly lit, trendy Mexican restaurant/bar on S Highland Ave pretty close to the plaza with Chipotle/Whole Foods that I visited as a part of a large group for a pre-interview dinner.

The Food:
Perhaps I am not the best person to talk about the food here because we did not have a traditional meal here. We were served buffet, BYOT (build-your-own-taco) style, and given a standard array of chicken, lettuce, salsas, and soft tortillas. We were served on their second story dining table which is basically a indoor balcony that seats a little over 20 people. I didn't find the food to be very special in any way, and thought the open room wasn't the best place for people to talk due to noise from the bottom stories.

The Establishment:
Situated on a row of shops rather than in a plaza, I'm not exactly sure where people park. When I came here, I ended up parking in the Whole Foods plaza which was about a quarter mile away. It's very dimly lit, and fairly loud, but was upscale in that most of the furniture was good heavy wood and the bathrooms were classy and clean. There is a large bar to your left as you enter that I did not try out.

The Service:
I can't really comment as I came with a large private group. After our initial drink orders, I didn't meet a waiter again.

Conclusions:
Mad Mex was a decent restaurant for our large group (~20 people) but unfortunately I was not impressed by the food. I do have to warn readers that my experience was likely marred because buffet-style food has to appeal to the broadest audience and I do favor adventurous places that take chances with their cooking. Mad Mex has a trendy vibe that will appeal to most young people and seems well suited for small groups of young adults."}
{"text":"Get the pickadippa and get the Black Bean Dip and the spicy cheese dip.  Third choice is on you.  Mad Mex has good appetizers, and acceptable entrees--I've had their enchiladas and burritos...the thai one is too \"out there\" to be successful, the tofu ones are pretty good, and the carnitas ones are excellent.

The unflavored margaritas are pretty good; the flavored ones are meh.  They have a great beer selection (and tequila selection) and happy hour features discounts on wings (which are pretty good).  The sangrias are on the sweeter side.  Student halfsies make me come here more often than I otherwise would--it's a great value."}
{"text":"My first experience at this location was definitely sub-par.  But I gave it another chance... many other chances and it never let me down again!  Plus, this is the only location that does brunch!   A perfect start to a lazy Sunday Huevos Rancheros and a Tequila Sunrise!!"}
{"text":"Food was average. You can tell its an American-Mexican restaurant.  The flavor is bland, their salsa is bland. Their burritos are big but as soon as you cut into it, everything falls out. And you end to eating a big plate of filling."}
{"text":"The food is outstanding at all of the Mad Mex's but I'm here to tell you about the perfect place to watch big Pittsburgh (or World Cup or men's and women's world cup and International matches)  game if you want to be social but still soak in the excitement of a sports bar.  They have a couple of projection sets they bring down behind the bar.  Tryi it, you won't be disappointed.  Hopefully you have a better track record than I do here for my teams. lol. I'm 1-4.  Rock on!"}
{"text":"What to say about one of my favorite drinking spots in town? One of the first times I visited Pittsburgh before I moved up, my current boyfriend took me by this location for some midday drinking. I was immediately in love. The big windows out front were open, letting in a nice breeze, it was sunny, and the bartender was very good. 

The restaurant was not very busy and the whole place had a very relaxed feel. Once I moved here, this became one of my go to spots to meet with people at - outside of the shitty parking, which isn't their fault. 

They have a good number of beer offerings, though the best part in my opinion is their selection of beers. The craft brews they offer are always on point. And my boyfriend loves their sangrias. He says they do one of the best in town.

Lest I forget about the food, I will say that I do enjoy it quite a bit. The carne enchilada with blue cornbread (ooooh, that blue cornbread) is my favorite on the list for sure. And make sure you ask for chips and salsa! Even if I go just for drinks I still end up with chips and salsa.

I don't have any complaints, like I said outside of the parking. During lunch time, it's a real bitch. If you can, grab a seat at the bar, forget the world for a few hours, and just chill out."}
{"text":"So I've lived in San Antonio, TX & grew up in Southern CA so I know Mexican food.  This is not that kind of Mexican food if you are looking at authentic, no kidding Mexican or even Tex-Mex food.  This would be more mid-Western tries to make Mexican food so understand what you are getting yourself into when you come here.  Knowing this, the drinks weren't bad, a lot of liberties with the alcohol, the food was given in large quantities, and they have vegan options.  The dipping sauce options and guacamole for the chips are actually pretty good (not really spicy though so don't expect that).  I had the chicken mole dish, and again, I should have known it wasn't going to be like the mole sauce I'm use to eating in southern CA or San Antonio, TX but the quantity of food was large.  Fun atmosphere, great kids menu and coloring books to keep them busy, and a great server for the 6 adults and 1 child in our group."}
{"text":"I've been here for happy hour a few times and love it.  The margaritas are excellent and the service is consistently good.  The food is American Tex mex and is good.  Don't miss the guacamole!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love mad mex margaritas???? Tip: Order two small (12oz) margaritas instead of the BIG AZZ (22oz) and you get 2oz MORE for $1 LESS! I LOVE their Honey Chipotle wings and Jersey chips, and Empandas, OK, i just love all their food! Great prices, excellent services! The only downfall is the wait time around Happy hour is HORRID!"}
{"text":"Pretty much the Pittsburgh interpretation of Tex-Mex. This pretty much entails terrible salsa, blue margarita salt. Not nearly as loud as the Oakland one, and a better bar. They had mole burritos so that was good. 

If you want Tex-Mex, go elsewhere. If you want to drink here with friends, well that's ok I guess. This and Steel Cactus are pretty much the same thing."}
{"text":"I've been here about a dozen times now and it hasn't disappointed me once. Food is always fresh, margs always good, N service always speedy! It gets wild in here on the weekends, so i suggest coming on the earlier side."}
{"text":"This place is one of the better Tex-Mex places in Pittsburgh, not to say it is the best, but I am hoping someday Pittsburgh gets some good Tex-Mex and barbecue places. 

I recently came here for Sunday brunch and I was not disappointed. They have a special that includes a brunch meal and a drink (alcoholic or not) for only $12. I ordered the chicken and waffles. I have to say the meal as a whole was more sweet than salty was a little bit of a let down. I really enjoyed the crispiness of the chicken and was hoping for a more crispy waffle. My friend ordered the breakfast burrito and it was my favorite burrito that I have had so far at Mad Mex. It was stuffed with eggs, potatoes, peppers, bacon, cheese etc. 

I would recommend getting any of the appetizers especially the black bean dip because it is delicious. I would not recommend the burritos (other than the breakfast one) since they are basically just completely filled with rice and they are bland."}
{"text":"I'm not really big on Burritos, so I usually would just come here to drink.  Awesome beer list and marg's.  Last night, I was craving a good salad, but couldn't think of where to go.  My boyfriend suggested stopping here because he wanted a good beer.  I got the chicken chopped salad and was blown away!  I think it mainly had to do with the lime-cilantro dressing.  It was pretty much like cilantro pesto and totally made the dish.  It had a little kick to it, which I liked too.  We also ordered a guac and salsa side.  Both were awesome and very fresh.  I'll be back not only for the drinks but now for the salads, too!"}
{"text":"We alway enjoying grabbing margaritas here during happy hour! beyond that, food is alright. The menu provides lots of options for vegetarians and vegans as well, thus it is usually a crowd pleaser."}
{"text":"Mad mex is one of my favorite places in Pittsburgh. Cool enviroment with great Menu. Make sure you try the Fajitas its great. My favorite is the steak and the shrimp."}
{"text":"I had the angry hippie vegan burrito, and oh my god. I was absolutely in heaven. I haven't been inside of this location as my friend ordered me food to go very late at night, but I seriously wish I had known about this place a long time ago. At $9 a pop, you get a massive burrito filled with vegetable goodness. 

It was hard to eat, and I only had half for dinner. The other half made excellent leftovers for a hangover breakfast the next day. I was pleased! 

I guess it's a little difficult to thoroughly review a place if you haven't EXPERIENCED it. I can say that I am immensely impressed with the vegan options. I don't have to eat a plain burrito here, I can go all out with vegan sour cream and cheese too. That's the beauty of Mad Mex.

I hope I get to visit again in the future. I find myself craving one of those Angry Hippie burritos time to time, and right now is definitely one of those times!"}
{"text":"Mad Mex is in absolute obedience to what must be the Great Commandment of Pittsburgh Dining: thou shalt serve tons of food, whether it's awesome or mediocre or just plain inedible.  My friends and colleagues seem to love this place -- and maybe it's just me, but I never understood why.  Sure, their burritos are twice the size of any burrito you can get in, say, Chicago; but what does that matter if they only have half the flavor?  Their food is always artfully presented, with colorful sauces everywhere; but when your \"hot\" sauce is mild to the point of tastelessness, what's the point?  And finally, the cost -- sure they give you a lot, but they charge you a commensurately high price.  I think I'd rather spend my money at Chipotle, honestly.

Not recommended."}
{"text":"Listen, I am not the most picky when it comes to Mexican food, but when I get to sit in good lighting with a large drink and a cool breeze blowing through my hair, anything tastes amazing. I am sure this isn't the top of the line when it comes to food, but I LOVE that it's open late and has a large menu--albeit of the same items in different combinations--but that's American Mexican food right? I liked going to this place at night and pretending I was on a tropical vacation. It was magical."}
{"text":"So far I have frequented Madmex in greentree /shadyside and now monroeville. Each one I had something a little different so the kudos and misses will vary just a heads up.

Greentree had the best stocked bar in pittsburgh I heart anyplace which stocks Absolut Pear... Mango or Acai Berry Ive been to Bars here who couldnt stock any of these so A++ for booze at this location. Here they had all three.

Shadyside the Margaritas were so yummy and so were the buffalo wings I was in heaven. Though be careful ordering the expensive bigass one with the sidecar extra shot thing....... creepy little bugger makes for a big buzz later :)

I tried the pork Carnitas burrito at Monroeville, along with chips and salsa. Here i cried for the authentic mexican of the southwest I truly miss, because the carnitas were so bland, the rice was white (ew) spanish please, and there weren't really any beans or corn in the burrito. Suffice to say Chipotle makes a better carnitas pork burrito for the same price or less. Also my 12 oz margarita was super tart and boozey.

Salsa the chipotle and the blk bean were yumm, the nacho cheese was gross but ive never been a fan of that. I would read some more yelp reviews before ordering here again or maybe just go here for drinks and apps."}
{"text":"Normally, I would prefer not to come to Mad Mex, especially the Shadyside location. It is always crowded and loud and just not fun. I have always felt the service to be sub-par and the food to be just not good. HOWEVER, this time I came for the Gobblerito.

I think it goes without saying that the food was good. The Gobblerito really is a delicious item. The gravy is good, the turkey meat quality is good, the ingredients aren't soggy or disgusting. It really is a quality thanksgiving meal.

Also, this time, our waitress was actually really great! We were having really absurd hilarious conversations, and she finally walked by and mentioned that she thought we were hilarious. She also accurately gave us all our orders (easy, cuz they were all Gobbleritos, but we did have some modifications). Alcohol service was also quick. And she really was quite pleasant and didn't even bat an eyelash when we asked to split our check 6 ways (which, we know is a pain, and so we all tipped her extra well).

So, all in all, my last trip to Mad Mex in Shadyside was a great experience even though I usually find it obnoxious there."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Mad Mex - endless burrito combinations and their margaritas outpace almost every Pittsburgh restaurant - so when I found out they started a prix fixe brunch I had to try it! Only $12 for a meal and a breakfast cocktail (or even a margarita!) 

I ordered the carnitas Sunday Street tacos with a Mad Maria. Amazing flavor with the cilantro and loved how they accompany them with over easy eggs for dipping. They give you four tacos, but they are pretty small so you're not in a complete brunch food coma when you leave. The Mad Maria (Bloody Mary with Tequila) was a nice twist from the standard drink and was the right amount of spicy.

My friends ordered the chicken and waffles and the steak and eggs skillet, both of which they recommend. Especially if you sub over easy eggs on the skillet."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, booths are roomy and comfy, servers are great. 

I got the Nacho Mama's Taco Platter (hehe) and a black cherry margarita. Everything was delicious, and the taco platter was wayy too much food. You can probably spread it over two meals, which isn't a bad thing."}
{"text":"I prefer this one over the one in Oakland because A) it's bigger and B) parking is actually a viable option here. I enjoy the atmosphere it's not as college like but it's the same quality food and large margaritas. At first I thought it was weird going to a Mexican restaurant for wings but omg they're so delicious that I've just accepted it. Usually I'm a little boujee and try to go for boneless wings but I wouldn't recommend it. Get messy and eat the ones with the bone in. I haven't found a sauce at Mad Mex that I didn't like. Also their big margaritas are amazing. I also recommend the shrimp burritos and their French fries. I could inhale their French fries. Also let's talk about the service. The people here are always so hospitable and I appreciate they at least pretend to like their jobs. I'm glad a Mad Mex isn't that close to me as I would hang out here all the time and my waist doesn't need that."}
{"text":"I believe that any place that offers wing specials for happy hour is a good place deserving of at least 4 stars. The special is half off wings. The waiter actually asked if I wanted the small order or the larger one. LOL. Who do I look like? Of course I want the larger order! It would be about $8! Yes please. I always get the BBQ sauce on the side. I like to do this so I can dunk the wings in myself and if I want to then get another sauce, I can without ruining or mixing the sauce flavors. I also get the blue cheese because I love their blue cheese. Does anyone else think that the spice they add to it puts it just a little over the top?

The only issues were the service. We would ask for things and those requests would never come. One of the requests came when we got our checks. We were brought out sour cream with our checks...not good. 

The wings are so good. I love that they are hearty, meaty, and oh so crispy. I ate half and took the rest home for lunch. I do wish they would give out a little more celery, but I bet if I asked they would oblige.

I think this is a fine place to head out to for happy hour. Get your Margs and wings; all while enjoying the atmosphere and your friends!"}
{"text":"The plus side... open late. Do not go there if your expecting Mexican. Our food came out quickly, but still managed to taste like it was under a heat lamp for 15 min. The chips were definitely out of a bag, and the salsa was an effort on their part. Almost everything was an effort to eat. The only things standing between them and TGIFriday is the \"flare\" and the cactus for a door handle. Oh, and I guess TGIFriday probably wouldn't be playing any Fujia & Miagi - you know, the typical Mariachi."}
{"text":"This place was by far the best place I've eaten in a long time! The nachos could feed 3 people and the quesadilla was out of this world! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great new location.  Bar in the center.  Place looks great!  Had to have the chips and salsa that are so tasty.  Had chicken tacos that come with spicy cabbage slaw and slice avocado. Yum.  Another success story from Big Burrito Group."}
{"text":"MOST AMAZING BURRITO OF MY LIFE!

This restaurant must have come out of a vegan's dream: seitan (\"wheat meat\"), Daiya (tapioca cheese), vegan sour cream, and tofu! And the burritos are SO GIANT that they look square and you definitely need to eat them with a fork. :-)"}
{"text":"Any negative reviews that a Pittsburgher gives Mad Mex is solely due to the fact that its been one of the city's mainstay great casual places for the last 10+ years.  You really cannot go wrong with nearly any burrito and wings combination.  Cap that off with a margarita, and you'll be happily full and tipsy by the end of your meal.  Out of towners, come and enjoy.  Pittsburghers, enjoy this classic for what it is- a solid, solid casual destination."}
{"text":"Mad Mex is always a go to for Mexican if its close. I normally frequent the one in Shadyside and North Hills. I would not categorize it as authentic, but trendy and inventive Mexican. We started with tortilla chips and a cheese dip which I wasn't too fond of. The cheese was way to spicy so we sent it back and ordered the traditional salsa which was OK. for my main meal, I ordered the wing-o tacos. this is my second time ordering these. I really time them. you get a choice of several different wing sauces and the chicken is in the chicken tender form dipped in the wing sauce. I have tried the San Francisco and the Honey Chipotle BBQ. they are both delicious. The meal comes with three tacos and a side of waffle fries which are equally as good."}
{"text":"I have only eaten the mexican chocolate brownie without cinnamon. I wouldn't have thought they could screw up a brownie sundae but they did. The brownie tasted like a boxed brownie that had sat in a fridge for a while and was microwaved. The iced cream was a bit hard, as if it too had sat in the freezer since last summer and was now being served. I realize it is a bar/mexican restaurant, but if they are going to make desserts so poorly they should take them off of the menu. Also, the edge of the plate looked to be dirty. 

I was there during happy hour.  The service was prompt. They have a good selection of beer. If I were to return to Mad Mex, I would go for drink specials and nothing else. 

The patio looks nice in the summer if you're looking to have a drink in the sun."}
{"text":"Reliable, dependable, wings are pretty good. Portions sizes are very filling. And it's family-friendly.  There San Francisco wing sauce is a favorite. Love the mole sauce!"}
{"text":"I am SO glad Mad Mex opened up a Shadyside location after having to practically sit on top of undergrads at the tiny Oakland location. It's beautiful in the inside, rich colours, and a garage door opening for summer nights. While it was pretty loud the time my boyfriend and I went to have late night margaritas with friends, we had good service, and my drinks came out quickly. Go after 10 pm for the $7 big azz margaritas. I love the raspberry and mango ones if I'm feeling wild :)."}
{"text":"We really like Mad Mex for what it is. Sure, it's fast casual--not upscale--but tasty. 

We especially like:
+ Turkey and chickpea chili
+ Potato taquitos
+ Los Wingos, buffalo, medium
+ Spicy Mad Mex burrito (I get a \"bare-ito\", no tortilla, shrimp, tofu sour cream, and fake cheese)
+ Nacho Mama's Taco platter (half crunchy; half soft is how the husband likes it)
+ Enchiladas (really like their Coronado sauce)
+ Super long beer menu with lots of choices on tap
+ Margaritas
+ Red sangria (never tried the white)

Great deals:
+Student specials M-Th 2-4pm (half off many food items)
+Happy Hour weekdays 4:30-6:30 (1/2 price drafts and wings and margarita specials--get a \"little butt\" for only $3!)

P.S. Brunch is served on Sundays. The huevos rancharos are great!"}
{"text":"Always great, never a miss! Had drinks and an appetizer last night meeting up with a friend. Our server was super nice and he didn't seem to care we just wanted to chat and not really eat. He even recommended mixing the kiwi and strawberry margarita together, it was a great choice!!! We ended up getting dinner to go and when I got home it was packed up neatly and just as yummy!!!"}
{"text":"I have tried their potato taquitos, nachos, salads, fries, and margs. The fries are waffle style and have been my favorite - come with a nacho cheese and spicy type of ranch for dipping. Everything else is pretty typical for a chain. Mad Mex is fun for the ambience and drinks, but otherwise nothing too spectacular. I usually have good service there. On Thursday-Saturday nights you can expect a short wait as this seems to be a popular spot. They have valet parking - otherwise parking is difficult in this area."}
{"text":"i can't really vouch for any of the other mad mex's but i like this one a lot. the staff are all friendly and always willing to mix you up a margarita of whatever flavor. the food is really good too, but i'll admit, unless there's a special going on, the prices can be a little steep. i am a big fan of the dips trio and mango margaritas though! and if you've never been to a mad mex, the atmosphere is so fun, i would tell anyone to check it out!"}
{"text":"What's not to love about this local chain, part of the Big Burrito restaurant group.  I've been a Mad Mex fan for years!  Lord only knows how many of those delicious frozen margaritas I've gotten drunk off over the years lol.  I've been to all MM locations multiple times except Cranberry and maybe South Hills.  I spent the most time in the smaller Oakland location, especially when I lived in walking distance some years ago.  I spent many a nights stumbling home after late night margarita specials!!  Happy hour is my favorite time to visit with margarita and 16oz draft beer specials and half off wings.  You've gotta try the Gobblerito around Thanksgiving time, it's delicious!  I'm a fan of the blue cornbread, try that also!  They have great beer and tequila selections.  I love the dark ambiance and year-round Dia de los Muertos decor.  The colorful sugar skulls and wall murals make any location fun to be at.  Be sure to sign up for their email list.  You're supposed to receive a free birthday meal offer, but I failed to receive one for my last b-day, but it's all good lol.  Maybe I'll get one next year.  Also, be sure to visit Bigburrito.com for special announcements, seasonal food menu changes, holiday events and more.  My favorite bartenders here are Sara and Jackie.  Parking can be slim along Highland, but I believe they offer free valet parking across the street for customers. Visit a Mad Mex location today for a good time..."}
{"text":"My Sunday ritual consists of sauntering into this establishment and doing the city paper crossword (in pen and I can't spell). Bummed they cut back the brunch menu but it is still a clutch brunch spot (and it's safely away from the masses lined up outside of Pamela eagerly waiting to get their fix of butter soaked everything with a side of afternoon diarrhea)."}
{"text":"I can't really explain the joy I felt when I first heard that a Mad Mex was opening on Highland. The thought of not having to sojourn to the suburbs and to never again return to Oakland was almost too much.

Last night, after months of drive-by stalking, it was time for us to meet. I was so excited for the complimentary valet parking I'd seen advertised on the sign outside. But when we got there, the sign was gone, there was no valet parking; it was as if I'd imagined it.

My boyfriend and I ordered chips and avocado tomatillo salsa (our fave) and a burrito each. I ordered a side of sauce with my burrito which arrived not on the side but inside the burrito. Refills were hard to come by. The chips and salsa did not arrive until we had finished our meals, and the salsa was sour and terrible and not even close to the avocado tomatiilo salsa we know and love. And I'm going to sound super old when I say this but IT WAS SO LOUD IN THERE.

The prices are higher, probably because of the complimentary valet, the hip location, and because this is, for serious, the handsomest Mad Mex ever. It would have been worth it had the food been of typical quality and the service remotely adequate. But alas, I'll be driving back out to the suburbs for Mad Mex because there, at least, they love me back.

*Because this review isn't long enough already, I'd like to take this opportunity to remind all restaurant goers out there to please keep your shoes on. Other people exist and are trying to eat.*"}
{"text":"My friend brought me here while I was visiting Pittsburgh and I'm a huge fan. Who doesn't love giant burritos? I got the chicken mole burrito and it was awesome. Friendly service, great prices and delicious food. Definitely recommend a visit here. And they've got a great patio out front for nice weather!"}
{"text":"On a Thursday evening, 4 of us were sat in about 30 mins. Not bad but in Shadyside. We found free street parking about 1 block down. The server greeted us in about 5 minutes, already bringing enough waters for everyone, which was awesome after a wait. To add, the interior decor was very cool and interesting. Great for date night or wanting to show new people the city. We ordered our food and then about 5 mins later ordered our drinks. The food came out pretty fast along with our drinks when the server asked if we needed anything else with our meals. I forget his name(I hate that!!) but next time I'll figure I out. My BF Got the got the Goblerita which is a corn, black bean mashed potato, turkey(Thanksgiving)  in a wrap. ORDER THAT. I ordered the taco salad which a little soggy halfway through when my burger meats juices soaked in but none the less the juices were delish. The bill was actually decent for a two drinks and entrees. So I leave this review saying please visit Mad Mex!!"}
{"text":"I like Mad Mex though the location is incredibly busy. I've gone on both a weekend and weekday night and the place seems to be hopping. Very fun vibe - music, props all over the place with a huge bar. Plus their front windows open up via a garage door which is where I prefer to sit. I've sat in the back and my eyes can't take the darkness that well. Food is mediocre - gets the job done and nothing in particular standing out. Quantities are typically on the larger side. Service has always been good though the one bunk thing is that you have to pay for chips and salsa!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went for a quick midweek lunch. We both ordered the burrito combo. He got steak with their black bean chilly, I got a shrimp burrito with the tortilla soup.  So freakin' good! The soup was perfectly flavored and the burrito was exactly what I needed. I could have finished the whole thing, but then I would have been miserable (if you leave Mad Mex hungry, that's on you). I got my leftovers to go, and then had them for dinner later that night. After a few hours and cold the burrito still help up. The tortilla wasn't at all soggy and the flavor was still on point.  

The Shadyside location is by far my favorite, when they have the front windows open, even in the fall it's just a great place to meet up for a casual meal."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Mad Mex! Doesn't matter the location because their food is always a great choice for a solid meal. 

I'm a huge fan of anything dipped in their San Francisco sauce: Wingo tacos or wings. They also have delicious fajitas and are best know for their famous Gobblerito (seasonal dish). If you are ever there and it's on the menu, don't even think twice about it! Just be sure to pair it with a STBC Pumking. 

I don't think I've ever had a bad meal here. They always have a great selection of craft beers and their sangria is one of the best in the city. Love Happy Hour? They have a great one on both drinks and food. The Shadyside location is one of my favorites because of the front patio and the restaurants also extremely large in size so there's never usually a long wait for a table."}
{"text":"You really, really have to watch what you order here.  In my experience there's been a 75% chance the food will be just short of inedible and a 25% chance it'll be awesome.  I had bad food twice at the Monroeville location.  Here I tried what Mad-Mex calls 'tortilla soup.'  It was tomato glop.  Then, just the other day, I tried the gobble-rito.  That was pure bliss.  I've been craving it ever since. Oh the paradox."}
{"text":"Every single time I try another Pittsburgh not-so-authentic Mexican place,  I just end up comparing it to Mad Mex Shadyside.  Thank you for being my gold standard all these years. I've been here 100 times and have only had one or two dishes I didn't care for, and I've never had a bad drink.  The atmosphere and layout are great, the prices are fair, food is good and consistent, and 9/10 times I get a really fun server."}
{"text":"The food was great, loved the set up and fresh air feel. My big disappointment and an important aspect was the service. Got my drink order wrong, never checked to see if order was okay or if we needed anything until we were finished. Will think twice before I go back to this location."}
{"text":"Obviously this place doesn't need a review. It's affordable enough so everyone can come without risk. For GF and dairy free eaters: they can substitute corn tortillas AND vegan sour cream and vegan cheese that melts like regular cheese. When I order a burrito, I order it naked with a side of corn tortillas and I make my own mini burritos. Expect to wait during rush hours (6-830), the bar is a good place to wait, even if you don't have a seat :)"}
{"text":"This place has a lot of seating and is a perfect place for lunch in between work since they have awesome lunch specials. You have to pay for parking on the streets, but now that it's nice out you can sit inside or outside. I definitely recommend right by their huge garage style window to get the best of both worlds. I got the carnitas burrito which was delicious!! Skip the tortilla soup though. Also make sure to sign up for their email list because new users get a complimentary lunch special that you can use that same day! Our waitress was awesome when we asked what she would recommend and it did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch with a friend.  Great service.  Great food.  Friend had the Red Bean Burrito and I had the Spicy Mad Mex Burrito.  Both were delicious.  Always get something good here."}
{"text":"So I don't know if anyone reading this uses Mint to manage finances, but basically there is this option where you can view total spending over the past few years by specific store/restaurant/etc. One day I did a search for Mad Mex, and the number that appeared was absolutely horrifying.

So I'm at this Mad Mex a lot. Too much, maybe. It's just so conveniently located, the happy hour is good, food is consistent, and most of the staff is very friendly. My history with Mad Mex started at the Oakland location while I was a Pitt undergrad, and once I moved to Point Breeze on the very edge of Shadyside, I was glad that this new location opened within walking distance. The location itself is WAY better than the Oakland restaurant. It's so much bigger, has a cool garage door, and a very large bar.

The margaritas. Okay, so they're not the best margaritas ever--not even close, really. But the BIg Azz margs are HUGE and are cheap during happy hour. My friends and I actually calculated that getting two Little Butt margaritas at happy hour pricing is a better value that one Big Azz. Two Little Butts will cost $6 for 24 total ounces, while a Big Azz is $7 for 22oz. Knowledge is power.

I usually stick to the Wing-O-Rito which combines two of my favorite foods: buffalo chicken inside of a burrito. The standard rice, black beans, and cheese are also inside, along with salsa and ranch or bleu cheese on the side. I find it really hard to deviate from this even though I'm sure there are probably many other tasty things on the menu.

One other food item I do love is the Pennsyltucky Fried Tofu. Try it. Even tofu haters will like it.

True story: one time my friends and I won a 20lb box of coconuts and bananas here (plus a round of free drinks). You just can't say that about most restaurants."}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour special!  Half price all beers, including a wide array of craft beer on tap!!!  

The happy hour crowd was packed in tight on Friday night when I was at Mad Mex in Shadyside.  On all sides of the U-shaped bar there were groups 2-3 people deep.  Unfortunately I was standing about 10 feet from the bathroom and en route to the kitchen, so I constantly had to move out of the way for people to walk by.

Shortly after the happy hour specials were over the crowd thinned to a more manageable size.  We stuck around for a few more hours and had a late dinner.  We shared veggie fajitas and fish tacos.  The portobello mushrooms were some of the best mushrooms I have ever had!  They must have been marinated because they had great flavor  and were grilled to perfection.  The fish tacos were pretty tasty as well.  Both dishes also came with a LARGE portion of rice and beans.  This is certainly not authentic Mexican, but for a chain restaurant, their food is pretty decent."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch and everything we got was delicious! I had the chicken and waffles and the chicken was juicy with the right amount of spice. The only problem I had was that my friend's chorizo was so good I wished that I had ordered some for myself."}
{"text":"As a Texan and an avid Tex-Mex lover, I was quite skeptical to come eat Mexican, let alone, Tex-Mex in Pittsburgh of all places. I came here for brunch with my BFF who has just moved to Pittsburgh. Knowing I might be disappointed in Mexican food up here, I was excited to get a wonderful brunch menu item. I chose the chicken and waffles, while the BFF chose a burrito. We also got a trio of guacamole, queso, and a salsa to start.

My chicken and waffles were off the chain amazing. The chicken was boneless and fried and tossed in a delicious spicy sauce. It was served with some agave nectar as well as some cream cheese concoction for dipping. Oh my goodness, it was just so amazing. The spiciness combined with the sweet creaminess of the cream cheese was just out of this world. I devoured my meal.

Now the BFF's burrito was not as good, sadly. To call it a burrito is even a bad choice of words. It was a moist, soggy tortilla that was not rolled in burrito form but simply wrapped around a large mound of mostly rice. It would have been great and probably more tasty if there was HALF of the rice. It was just silly how big it was and the rice distracted from the other ingredients. 

As I looked around, I saw a few other pairs of diners in which one got chicken and waffles, and the other got a burrito. It was so sad really, because mine was so good and I kept talking about how good it was and her's was just mehhhh... 

All in all - fabulous brunch, lame burritos. Go try the chicken and waffles NOW!"}
{"text":"This location is open late which is really convenient! The ice cream burrito is very tasty. The only downside was the 30 minutes it took the waiter to bring the check...oh well!"}
{"text":"Given the fact that I absolutely love Mexican food, I can't believe I lived in Pittsburgh for almost two years before finally making my way to a Mad Mex! I came to the Shadyside location on Saturday evening with three friends. It was packed, but surprisingly the hostess was able to seat us right away.

One of the first things I noticed is that the restaurant is extremely dark - obviously in an endeavor to set the mood, but I would have liked just a little more light. We were seated by a window, however, which helped. If you're coming to Mad Mex expecting traditional Mexican food, you'll be disappointed. The food here is highly Americanized, so you just have to know that and accept it going into things. We started off by ordering some chips, salsa, and guacamole for the table. The salsa was a bit too spicy for my liking, so unfortunately I didn't eat much at all. The guacamole was actually better than expected, and I noted that the chips were piping hot and fresh when they came to the table. Service was quick, and despite the fact that our waitress had many tables, she did give us a decent amount of attention. 

I ordered the chicken fajita burrito, which includes all the traditional components of the regular burrito (chicken, rice, black beans, and lettuce) while also adding in sautéed onions and peppers. The burrito was absolutely huge. This is the first burrito I've ever eaten that I was simply not able to pick up and was forced to eat with a knife and fork. It was like a brick! For ten dollars it was a great deal, as I took half of it home with me. The flavors were good, but honestly didn't wow me. 

I hate to say it, but if I want Americanized Mexican food, I think nine times out of ten I would head to Chipotle over Mad Mex. That being said, I still enjoyed my burrito and enjoyed the atmosphere on a busy Saturday evening."}
{"text":"As soon as I got here I was slightly appalled because they sat me outside with my service dog and when I made a fus about having a service dog and being forced to sit outside in the cold I was properly seated inside. The service was ok the drinks were not bad until the second round the mix or ratio was way off, the only good thing about this place was the random good song and our server. 


So update I was invited back on 6/12 the service and food was a lot better so was drink I had. WAY better than the other night and this time there was no issues bribing my service dog into the establishment it's actually doubtful anyone noticed her except when we came in and left. This service was a lot better and will likely come back again"}
{"text":"Server was great, I wish I got her name but she had curly hair in a bun and medium skin tone. Food was great! The desert and margaritas were awesome. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about Mad Mex. It's a love/hate relationship---I love it so much and hate myself for eating too much. Happy hour is of course fun. Central place to meet up with friends for a laid back outing."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for a late lunch/early dinner. 

What we sampled: 
Banana Slama Margaritas (where on happy hour special 16oz. for 5 dollars!  Tottally worth it and delicious)
San Francisco Insane Wings (hot and delicious!)
Pica Dippa Peppita hummus, xx chesse dip, guacamole (could have done without this, the flavors where off and weren't that interesting)
Carnitas Burrito (very hard to share between two people, but very delicious)
Ice Cream Burrito 1/2 Saturday 1/2 Sunday style (OMG a must try insane)

Overall the food quality was good, but with so many great places to eat I don't know that I would be rushing back."}
{"text":"I need to update my review here because it's been since the opening of this Mad Mex and they've got a good groove going on. All my favorite dishes are spot on, including the dance marathon enchilada! 

I love that they experiment with seasonal margarita flavors. I would have NEVER thought a pumpkin margarita would taste good... But magical hit does. And Apple Cider with a caramel sugar rim, hello delicious! 

I truly love Mad Mex and its wacky themes and its play on Mexican food!"}
{"text":"I think Mad Mex's food is a bit overrated, but the magaritas on happy hour special are a good deal, and tasty.  The beer menu is awesome!  Expensive, but excellent selection.  The Shadyside location is spacious and comfortable.

I love their black bean dip (and, accordingly, the black bean and pineapple quesadilla).  Much of the other food I've had here is pretty Meh and definitely \"Mexican inspired\" rather than close to anything authentic (or even authentically Tex-Mex-y).  The chips and salsa make me downright hostile because a) they are expensive, b) the texture is too thick and they taste as they came directly out of a supermarket-bought Tostitos bag, and c) they are often somewhat stale, so it's more like that Tostitos bag was bought and left open 2 weeks ago. Gross.  

The Gobblerito is, indeed, a thing of Seasonal Beauty.  If you don't mind the resulting carb-coma, it is definitely something to try."}
{"text":"As a former employee of Mad Mex Robinson, and a current regular at Mad Mex ShadySide, it kind of pains me a little bit to re-review and give them 3 stars - but in reality, it's a 2.5.  But now that they're almost a full year in - the shining example they displayed with great food and service during their opening month, has dwindled severely.

The reason for the re-view and severe star-docking?  Their consistency in food quality and service is non-existent at this location.  Jordan and I walk over there at least once-twice a week when we don't want to cook, and we have discovered that the only good time to go and get awesome food, is a busy Saturday night, because that's when the best line cooks and servers are scheduled to work.  If we go on a not-so-busy afternoon or weekday evening, our food sucks, and the service is even worse.  And ordering To Go isn't really a time-saver since the Bartender will ignore you.

I will leave out server and bartender names, just to be polite, but MULTIPLE servers (and I mean MULTIPLE) here, are just the worst in the city.  They're forgetful, slow, and always diffusing responsibility to a faceless kitchen.  On those days that we would go in the afternoon, every server on the floor is still visibly drunk and/or high from the night before, and audibly bragging about it.  Not that I care that people are drunk and/or high - but just be sure you can still function at a basic human level if those are your life choices.  

My favorite things on the menu are the Angry Hippie Burrito, Foo-Foo Fajitas, and the Tofu Tacos.  Now when we go on a Saturday night - these plates are BANGIN' and totally delicious.  I crave the Tofu Tacos because they're so unique and so filling - whatever that glaze is on the tofu - I can't recreate it at home, unfortunately (and we have TRIED!).  I have to go to Mad Mad to enjoy my Tofu Taco craving.  The Angry Hippie Burrito is freaking awesome too, because it's enormous and there's tons of veggie goodness in it (if it's not overly dominated by black beans).  The Foo-Foo Fajitas - portobello and tofu and a party of other veggies (zucchini, corn, onions, peppers) - just makes love to your face once the skillet passes in front of you.  

Though the wait times are long on weekends, you will mostly likely have a better food and service experience.  I promise."}
{"text":"Pretty consistent with both service and food.  It's a pretty small restaurant though, and can be pretty awkward having someone you don't know sitting cheek to cheek.  Definitely a tex mex though."}
{"text":"Love all the vegan options here. 
Have had two dishes. HERB O'VORÉ'S TOFU TACOS  were amazing.  
the second was ok. it was the GRILLED PORTOBELLO AND TOFU FAJITA, the portobello was great but the tofu had some green stuff on it and it just tasted raw. 
wait time can sometimes suck but most of the time it hasn't. 
still need to make it to 2-4 half off days"}
{"text":"We were a party of 9 coming in for some late night dining, and Meg's service alone deserves 5 stars. She was so genuine and hospitable, even in a late night rush, where other servers might check out and become apathetic. Not Meg--she made our night a complete breeze with her attentive presence and positive disposition. The tequila list is long and diverse, but I'm more of a beer and whiskey drinker. The tap beer and bourbon selection is quite varied and extremely well priced, and I was happy to imbibe on some local beer and delicious bourbon. The food is fine. However, I think the menu could be paired down. Maybe a little \"less is more\" could go a long way. There's hints at quality ingredients and preparation but the menu is just too long for any one thing to stand out.  The atmosphere is fun, loud music that begs for some dancing. 
Thanks Meg, for making our dining experience easy and fun!"}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan of this Mad Mex. When we can't think of somewhere new to venture for dinner, we generally find ourselves here. Even though I love authentic Mexican food, sometimes you just want some wingos tacos with a side of waffle fries! And don't forget the ranch to dip it all in. 

The sangria is delicious. Our service has always been pretty good with speedy and nice servers. I also like the large bar area and all the tables that surround it. 

We've even done take out a few times and when we order the guac to go, it comes with our very own pre packaged bag of chips. The presentation is great. 

And of course I have to mention the goblerito. Only available seasonally, but it's just a must have around Thanksgiving. You'll need a nap afterwards but it's well worth the calories and fullness. Mashed potatoes, beans, turkey, corn, and stuffing all wrapped up in a burrito. With gravy. And cranberry sauce. Cmon."}
{"text":"Mad Mex Burrito with chicken was amazing and the service was great! The chicken, rice, and beans were extremely well seasoned. The salsa and chips were excellent and very fresh. I would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of mad mex when I visit Pittsburgh. It would do well out here in Los Angeles. The salsa is good but we always go straight to the queso. I usually get the wingarito tacos. It's a ton of food and it's all good. They obviously source their fries from the same vendor as chick fil a. So if I'm craving non hateful fries I can get them here. Always great service too."}
