{"text":"I just want to say they have best shisha ever and also there food is really good. I would not go any where accept to Shahrazed.

I don't go any where accept to Shahrazed. they open very late on the weekend. the weekday they open late but not like the weekend."}
{"text":"This Shisha place is not bad, I actually wanted to give it 3.5 stars but i guess I can't. My friends and I go there fairly often, usually once a week or so.   The Good: -Pretty roomy, lots of space, doesn't feel cluttered or uncomfortable. -Shisha is not bad as well, they tend to have different ppl preparing the shisha's in different days, but its pretty decent most of the time. I like the grape/mint combo, and we usually get a large red mint tea with it as well-- really nice especially in winter. -Food is pretty decent as well, I usually go for their sandwiches, their fries are pretty good as well, but i hate the rice. -INTERNET works great there, its probably the main reason I prefer to go there, sometime we bring our laptops there to get some work done. -They open up late, sometimes on saturdays we stay till 4 am.  The Bad: -It gets really stuffy fast and sometimes hard to breath a little, even when there aren't many people. They really need to improve their air circulation  -The music is way too loud, sometimes we can't have a conversation at all, its really dumb. -Some of their shisha pipes are made out of plastic and really have a crappy feel to them- always ask the waiter to give you the other kind when u order, never the cheap plastic stuff  The service really varies from nite to nite, it depends on whos working there, which nite you go and how crowded the place is. When its packed its usually slow, takes 30min to get your order, and even longer to get your food. Other times its pretty quick, but its not consistent at all, and they seem to have a large rotating group of waiters/waitresses that keep on changing every time I go lol. Anyways, their prices are pretty fair compared to other places in the city, I would recommend you try them and judge for yourself."}
{"text":"I created a yelp account just to complain about this place. Poutine and shisha was over priced, 7$ small poutine 15$ one head of shisha. Shisha was given to us unlit, service was horrible and borderline rude, and she imposed/assumed her own tip and doesnt accept cards. Took us nearly an hour just to get someone to give us the bill. Unsanitary tables as well. Never coming again, avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place on the way back to our hotel room. I'm a hookah enthusiast, so this may be a biased review. The food was excellent and the hookah was stellar. They also have Backgammon/chess & checkers. It's a cozy lounge with comfy seats and a pleasant, attentive staff. I'm hitting this place a few more times while I'm in town."}
{"text":"The most horrible restaurant experience I've had in Montreal! It was the definition of dirty, with the chairs torn apart and the tables barely standing the weight of the food. The food itself was the worst part: we had a sandwich that was made with old chewy bread and a few flakes of meat spread on it. The hummus was OK, and the salad was nothing more than bitter lettuce with a bit of dressing. In the end, the waitress didn't even have enough change to return the rest of the bill, and I was almost forced to give more tip than I intended simply because I didn't want to wait for her to ask every single person in the restaurant for change! If you're planning to have some good time, I think Shahrazad should be your last option!"}
{"text":"The service was great, the place is relatively cheap... I ordered some shish kebab and was amazed by the quality of food( maybe not 5 star restaurant level, but exceeded my expectations)."}
{"text":"Good shisha, friendly waiters but a bit expensive . I believe it needs renovations as the couches were a bit old.  Other than that i would say good. Thats why im giving 4 stars.  Note: tips are included in ur receipt"}
{"text":"Great place to chill with friends and the workers are nice. In downtown, so it's super convenient and lowkey also a nice place to do school work."}
{"text":"Hi guys this place is not good, the worst service ever, all they care about is you paying for a horrible service and expensive,I will never go there again and Â»i do not recomend it to any one, there is a lot of other place a way better and cheaper.This place is even dirty, they dont clean up properly."}
{"text":"A divey hookah bar in the Concordia/Crescent area, that is perfect for what it is: a smokey student dive hookah bar.  Perfect for hanging out with friends for a few hours, to chat or even play a board game.  There isn't much ambiance to speak of, but if you're with good company, does it really matter?  Pull up a chair to a table, order whatever you feel like (in my case I like a nice pot of tea), wait for those who are smoking to get their hookah, and then be prepared to watch time slip away.  As others have mentioned, service is . . . interesting.   At the price it costs though, no complaints, you just got to go with the flow."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place when we were in Montreal, and it was fantastic! It's a hookah bar that's open late (especially during Ramadan), and it has a great variety of flavors to try. They have a full food menu, too, but we only tried the falafel, which was good. There are a lot of cozy couches and big tables for groups, as well as smaller tables and chairs. They have a stash of backgammon boards for people to enjoy while smoking hookah. The atmosphere was lively and it was a great pit stop at the end of the night."}
{"text":"One of the worst shisha bars I've been to, and i've been to quite a few.  My friends and I received our food 20 minutes apart from each other, they wouldn't allow me to have water unless I stand at the bar even though I bought a meal and shisha, we had no service after we did receive our food, the smoothies we ordered were warm, they didn't accept credit nor debit (which is some cases is fine, but expected cash yet didn't even have cash to give back and made us do the calculations.) When we got fed up and decided not to tip, he forced a tip on us. Only positive part is that the manager gave me a discount since I was so upset with their \"service\" and the food DID taste good. Never going back again."}
{"text":"Shahrazad. Where to begin?  Great food, the Jelena crepe is amazing, as is the lime Lulu mojito esque icy beverage.  They also carry Fairouz as Laziza malt soda which goes really well with Shisha. The tea is decent, way overpriced, but not too bad.  The Shisha is decent, they recently have new pipes si ils bettet than it was.  The service needs work. The place is always busy and no matter how many waitresses they hire it's always a long wait. I would recommend a mobile app that let's you order from your table. There are plenty available.  The decor is falling apart. The couches need to be replaced, its starting to look dingy.  Aside from that its quite a decent place, though I would recommend hiring a DJ. The music at the Zad sucks"}
{"text":"This place hasn't changed a bit since 14 yrs ago when I used to hang out here as a McGill student. Still large, maybe with a newly chipped paint on the walls. Still a university hangout.   The sheesha menu was reasonable. I am a sheesha buff so I thought I would ask our server for to fill out base with an orange crush or milk and ice combo with blue mist on the top. She went to ask her manager whom agreed to the orange crush! HELL YEAH!true customer appreciation. The sheesha bottle itself was nice but a cheap quality hose. The quality of the molasses was great. I liked they gave us extra coals. The smoke got thick at times and it was hard go control the filter but I didn't mind it.  The down side they don't give tap water for free. Complete DISAPPOINTMENT. If cigar lounges can give free water - with more tobacco content in a cigar! A sheesha lounge should give complimentary water. I mean you guys are already killing our lungs so why not ease the symptomology so we can come back to have one more smoke? Give free water!"}
{"text":"The worst service I have ever had. At the end they asked for 20% tip. Non-negotiable!! I had a discussion with the waiter then all of the employees came to fight!!!  Overpriced, unwelcoming environment, poor shisha quality and 20% tip.  I will never be back."}
{"text":"Well, what would you do if the staff is aware of your presence and does not bother taking your order more than 20 min after you seated? Leave, unless you enjoy staring at an immature crowd in an untidy and common coffee shop-looking spot."}
{"text":"It's an alright hookah bar.  I've found that a lot of people have the bad habit of hogging entire couches despite not being large enough of a party to take up said couches, which can be a bit annoying when all that's left is one tiny table and you're with a bunch of your friends.  The mango smoothie is delicious, but expensive.  The food and drinks are pretty expensive in general.  Actually, just smoking shisha and getting one item each usually costs me and my friends quite a bit.  The atmosphere varies - sometimes I get an awesome waitress and sometimes I get the \"my shift ends in 10 minutes, pay me now\" girl who is still there an hour and a half later.  The setting is quite intimate, and I'm often placed next to large parties of people, which isn't conducive to having your own conversation with your friends.  Or at least, not conducive to hearing them.  Oh, and don't worry, if there isn't enough white noise from people's conversations, the staff will be nice enough to blast Top 40 hits from the stereo about 20 decibels above your comfort level.  Sometimes there will be the odd creepy guy who is \"studying\" and smoking shisha by himself, and who just stares and listens to everything you're saying.  I suggest having a staring contes with this mant; you will always win.  Most people put the hookah on a table rather than on the ground; this is problematic as the little flavoured tobacco tablets have this habit of sparking randomly into the air when they're initially lit.  It has happened where sparks from someone else's hookah have landed on my clothing or in my hair.  I have also had my own hookah do this - the sparks landed in some girl's purse.  She had no idea as she was too busy talking about how annoying she thought Carl at work was; he was always hitting on her and god, it's just so annoying to punch in and have him be there leering at her.  Anyway, her purse didn't catch fire, but still - what if it had?  I don't know what purses are made out of.  Hers could have been made out of cardboard with kerosene glue for all I knew.  I'm sure even Carl from work would have agreed that any potential fire hazard would mandate that hookahs should be kept on the ground.  Or some sort of cover should be put on top of the hookahs?  Anyway, something should be done before the fire marshals are called, is my take on it.  I've found that if you stay late, on your way out there is a 50% chance you will be harassed by a group of Persian men who loiter outside seemingly just to make smart-ass comments at you and to hit on the girls with you.  This is my favourite part of the experience, as nothing finishes off a semi-comfortable hookah bar experience than a bunch of strangers sexually harassing your friends and threatening to fight you when you give them a dirty look.  If it seems like I really hate this place by my review, I really don't.  All of its faults are endearing to me.  I almost always have a decent time, and thought I'm not a shisha expert, the shisha itself tastes great (although I feel ill when I smoke it for hours and hours).  Also, 99% of the people you want to talk shit about will never step foot in this place, making it the perfect place to vent your frustrations out to your friends.  Carl will never know what you really think about him."}
{"text":"One of the best if not the best shisha place in Montreal. Every time i go to Montreal this my to go place. Shisha on point even better than the ones in Toronto. I have tried their juices as well and tastes very good and made fresh.  The only reason i would give it 4 stars is that their customer service is kind of slacking as theyre always short staffed esp at nights. They barely check up on u after taking your order but the shisha and environment makes it up for me."}
{"text":"Good hookah, terrible service. You seat yourself and we received menus right away ... then ... chirp chirp ... nothing for 20 minutes. After seeing 2 tables of over 12 people served before us, we had to seek out a server. Everything was brought out promptly but then we waited another 30 minutes for anyone to check on us ... again we had to find someone. $12-15/first hookah, 8-12/each after.  There is also no air circulation - you feel like you're sitting in a smoking box. Top that with no AC in the summer and you get lightheaded before your hookah even arrives.  Don't waste your time; it kills the experience. Next time we'll try the place up the street.  Cash only! They fail to mention this until it's time to check out."}
{"text":"Good location, good vibe, pricey for a middle eastern hangout place. Service can be worked on and ofcourse, only cash payments?!"}
{"text":"Great place to go for shisha and the atmosphere is nice. The service is good also. Love that place"}
{"text":"This place was okay. Service was not good.we needed a hooka refill but it took them forever, we had to physically walk up to them while they were playing cards."}
{"text":"unfortunately my first experience here was on NYE. This may account for shortcomings in service.  The reasons for the poor review: - inattentive service. we watched 3 tables(possibly regulars) be seated and acknowledged before we had our orders taken. 2 couples that were seated at similar times left due to the wait. We had to find our server for the bill, and again to pay. -CASH ONLY. we may have overlooked any signage. unfortunately this became a problem when the server didnt give us proper change, and made it seem that I was trying to short him the money owed. - average shisha options. The shisha wasn't bad here, just not as much variety as other places. -location and atmosphere are subpar. this location/business may cater best to the customer demographic for the area (mostly college students and people leaving bars) -tea options/drink options minimal."}
{"text":"A huge shisha place in core downtown of Montreal. They offer a wide verity of shisha flavours and some aromatic teas. I love their Mint tea, a lot. Their snacks are decently priced and proportioned. There is a lot of sitting space, although couches and chairs are all torn, not a very classy in looks, but I love spending time there with a group of friends. The place is inexpensive but they accept only cash (or maybe debit). The Arabic music adds flavour to your shisha and hangout!"}
{"text":"Being a hookah addict (really but not really)  I try to find a hookah bar to hangout and relax in every city that I go. Whether its Morrocan or Persian, I'm not picky.  This place was a typical low budget hookah bar with big enough drink/food menu and free board games to play.  It was crowded but we found a table (abeit dirty) to sit at.    Only gripe was the snooty patrons saving entire rows of couches. Obnoxious"}
{"text":"It's a fairly small shisha lounge downtown. I'd say it's fair pricing for the shisha  my top flavors are blue mist and green apple. It's a really chill atmosphere. If you want something, ya better ask. Because even if you have a look of desperation on your face nobody will come check on you.   With Concordia right around the corner, it gets full of their students. Just a little FYI  The food there is decent. If you want a chocolate shake be sure to ask for a \"chocolate milk shake\" rather a \"chocolate shake\" they have me chocolate milk lol  Overall this place is decent. It's the company you bring that makes it a good time.   Overall it's an okay lounge"}
{"text":"Horrible service, rude at that.... Shisha was not enjoyable at all.... Did not enjoy it here there is better Daisha spots around for sure"}
