{"text":"This review is based on 2 dinners recently enjoyed at Batifole.  Everything I've ordered has been excellent, which includes the escargots, chicken liver brûlée, and the cassoulet which is the best I've had in Toronto. Service is good, restaurant is relatively small but inviting, and a very extensive wine list. Would highly recommend and intend on returning in the not-so distant future."}
{"text":"Wonderful French food with authentic French service!

Batifole is one of my favourite restaurants in the city that combines delicious, flavourful food with a wonderful welcoming atmosphere.  Every time I visit I end up ordering far too much and sit enjoying the food for hours while sipping delicious wine. 

The service is very good and friendly, although typically French.  There is no rush for servers to get drinks or clear plates but that is one of the things I enjoy.  It is the 'old way' of eating out where quality takes time but is well worth it ensuring a consistent, relaxed atmosphere even when the restaurant is full to the brim.  The chef/owner has always come out at the end of the meal to ensure it is enjoyed and to say hello.

Two of my favourite dishes are the veal chop and duck two ways.  Both are generous portions and even though I am not a meat lover in general I cannot help but finish the full plate every time.  If you are a chocolate fan you should not leave without having the chocolate lava cake served on a bed of caramel.  The cake is to die for - perfectly balanced, it is rich and sweet without being overwhelming. 

Please note that if you are in a rush, don't eat here - you would be doing the restaurant and yourself a disservice.  Batifole is where you go to savour and enjoy food at your leisure."}
{"text":"I went into this dining experience, really wanting to like Batifole.  I love the idea of a neighbourhood french bistro in the middle of Chinatown east, serving up simple, tasty food.  To it's credit, I loved my starter of housemade chicken liver pate and yes, as other reviewers have mentioned, the bread  is good.  I saw a beautiful steak come out of the kitchen that I WISH I had ordered instead of my fish -  a bland, texture-less, white-sauced to within an inch of it's life slab with flabby, tasteless mushrooms.  I want to believe that I went on a bad day, but I don't think I'll be taking another kick at this can when there are many other bistros in the city serving up consistently great french-inspired fare, at comparable prices."}
{"text":"After hearing about it for ages (\"Riverdale's worst kept secret\" \"Impossible to get a table\" etc.) we finally made it to this lovely spot in Chinatown East. It's comfortable, colourful and not too noisy. Excellent wine list, and the server was wonderfully helpful with it.

But only three stars, because while the starters wow, the mains come up short. I had a terrine of chicken breast and roasted red pepper with a miniature salad: delicious. Others tried the savoury escargots for once served in a real sauce and not slopped with butter.

Then my cassoulet arrived. This is a dish I chase down wherever I can find it. Debate rages as to how best prepare it. At Batifole the duck confit sits on top while baking and so it's a bit dried out. There's a giant slab of pork belly that's just a bit too much. The sausage wasn't distinguished and for my taste, there wasn't enough liquid in the dish. Don't get me wrong, it was still good, but not great.

My fellow diners who ordered the rabbit were similarly unimpressed, but a tartar of horse sirloin got raves.

I had Floating Island for dessert, which was pretty good. It's a meringue in a pool of creme anglaise with fruit garnish. Those who ordered the creme brulee pronounced it the best they'd ever had!

I soooo want to find a French restaurant I can love unconditionally in Toronto. Batifole ain't it, but I would come back here anyway."}
{"text":"I was expecting to be wowed at Batifole. I wasn't, but I was happy with my choices. Bottom line: it's a solid French restaurant with semi-fancy dishes in a low-key setting. For the neighbourhood it's excellent. Overkill, even.

The cassoulet is excellent. The bouillabaisse is delicious. Loved the escargots. Bread and butter never tasted so good. Wine list is extensive. One of my favourite creme brulees of all time. (And I've eaten many a creme brulee.) Service was friendly and the atmosphere is more low-key than I expected. Those were the highlights. 

The rest was not bad, but not superb. The lobster and Sebaste soup was extremely fishy tasting. And I love fish. I eat anchovies and caviar, and put fish sauce on veggies. It was not a good fishy taste. The dory provençale was bland. And lemony. (Should provençale be lemony?)

The two meat dishes ordered at our table--veal flank steak topped with shallots and beef tenderloin in a Dubonnet demiglace with blue cheese--though both delicious and cooked nearly perfectly, came with nothing but the meat. With only three choices of sides (salad, sauteed veggies, or fries) a vegetable paired directly with the main would have been nice. The fries had good consistency and flavour, but far too much salt, IMO.

I might go again and try other things on the menu because what was good was VERY good. But what wasn't so hot wasn't worth the trip. And I live just a few blocks away."}
{"text":"Batifole came recommended by a number of friends - two thumbs up. Nice decor, simple yet elegant. Our sever greeted us immediately upon arrival and seated us at our table of choice. Whilst we perused the menu the kindly brought some Rosemary infused water.  She then proceeded to provide a very detailed breakdown of the day's specials, so far so good :)

My partner settled on the duck croquette starter and I on the Pernod sautéed shrimp.  As we awaited the started we enjoyed the warm baguette and creamery butter - two thumbs up.

Woohoo, the starters are here. Very nice and as we agreed to share we get to savour a little of each. Both of us agreed they were delightful - 2 thumbs up. 

We patiently await the mains whilst sipping on a cold Krononbery  - I have to say the choice of beer is pedestrian and uninspiring, c'est la vie!  

It's here :).  I found the frites over salted and after consultation with she who must be obeyed we determined they were!  No thumbs up . The veal chop and crustade of Lamb confit both were fine but certainly not overwhelming and to a degree over salted - one thumb up 

Time for our cycle back to the beach, let's hope the ride doesn't make us too thirsty. We'll have to decide if we wish to return, at these prices it could be risky."}
{"text":"Note to other restaurants: Bow down to Batifole, motherpuckers.

I went back recently and wow. Batifole does so many things right from their execution of food, to service, to extremely reasonable pricing. They've added bouillabaisse to the menu, and with one sip I was transported back to the South of France. The heady broth is scented with plenty of fennel, and the fish and mussels were cooked perfectly. 

Do you know how much work goes into this seafood soup? I will probably never attempt to make this at home so I'm happy to shell out the $18 they charge for this dish. At this price, it's an absolute bargain.

I tried my dining companion's baked filet of smooth-dory topped with zucchini ($18) and it made me think that every restaurant should send their cooks to have mandatory fish training with the Batifole chef. The dish is perfumed with aromatic herbs and the fish just melts in your mouth. 

Batifole is a small, unassuming restaurant but it somehow delivers food that tastes like a team of French cooks in chef whites and funny hats have been slaving over it all day.

Unfortunately, my starter of chicken liver brulé was less successful. It was boozy and the candied brulé topping was too sweet for the dish. I prefer the elegance of the chicken liver parfait at Biff's.

The frites were stellar and have become my gold standard for spuds in this city.

They have cute signs in the restaurant that say Batifole is \"The best restaurant in Chinatown\" but after my visits, I think they could broaden the parameters of that claim.

(No credit cards, but debit is accepted which is one way they keep their prices low.)"}
{"text":"The chalkboard in the restaurant says it all \"The Best French Food (without attitude) in Chinatown-East\"
Quiet subdued atmosphere, simple but intriguing menu with very interesting specials of the day - appetizers + main courses. Wine by the glass. Street side patio. Nice personal touches like cranberries floating in ones water-glasses. Owner Chef always around. Open every day (except Tuesday) after 6pm."}
{"text":"The restaurant is the perfect size. Not so large, but you don't feel cramped in. 

The server was very knowledgeable on the menu. We ordered the Cheese platter to start, told her what we liked and let her choose the cheese. It was perfect! 

For mains we had the crustade of Lamb Confit with Thyme jus and the duck Confit. Both were delicious mains. We got two sides but I think one would have been enough. The potato gratin were amazing. So creamy and delicious. 

To top it off, our wine was delicious. 

We got the creme brulee for dessert - you have to at a French restaurant. It was also delicious. 

While we were eating, the chef came out which was nice! 

All the food was very reasonably priced. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Amazing spot! Very quaint and personal. Delicious food and very helpful service. Don't know what to eat? Ask your waiter and you're in good hands!"}
{"text":"Its called \"The Best French Food in Chinatown\" but a more apt nickname for this once great Bistro is \"The McDonalds of Chinatown\".  French food is to be enjoyed and discussed and for many it is a 3 to 4 hour delight.  With the previous owner that was the case with a must cheerier atmosphere and decor.  The current Chef and Owner changed the decor and attempted to keep Batifole as it was.  However, 2016 sees the decline of this once great restaurant in living color.  First what they do not tell you is that they book their table in 2 hour increments, and ask you to leave regardless if your meal is finished or not after that two hours or so.  If you happen to be that second table you are asked to wait until the table is emptied of guests.  On our last and final visit a drunk and belligerent mouthed off to us as he was obviously waiting for our table to clear.  As we were paying for the meal, which can only be done by the bar, this guy and his party moved outside.  As we were leaving we were attacked by Mr Drunk and his henchmen.  Once the fight was broken up they were escorted inside and we were summarily dismissed.  We have written to the restaurant to complain but of course we never received any kind of apology or acknowledgement.  If you like good french food there are other better run restaurants in Toronto with Batifole on its last leg."}
{"text":"I'm french and i was homesick then i decided to reach a french restaurant, so I had dinner to Batifole with friends, there's a big French flag in front of the place: you can't miss it. We thought that it was quite strange to find such a restaurant in Chinatown East, surrounded by Asian places but it was a wonderful experience! 

We appreciated the very fresh and traditional French bread and butter (so important). I had the clams, very tasteful and interesting because it's unfamiliar to marry it with merguez (lamb sausage) but it works very well. Then I had the duck prepared confit and pan seared, good as well. But the chocolate Creme for dessert was exceptional! The service was really helpful and made us feel welcome. I would strongly recommend this restaurant, thanks again for this dinner experience.

:)"}
{"text":"Best kept restaurant secret in Toronto. Some of the best French food I have ever had. Easily beats the more expensive, and pretentious, options downtown. Strange location but I like that - keeps it from getting too buay. The Cassoulet is a must have before you die. Friendly atmosphere and staff."}
{"text":"I normally try to keep my reviews concise and get down to business with facts without bashing anybody but let me telll youuu....

Ok, so we walk into this French restaurant located at the edge of a little 'AsiaTown so to say' (I don't know if it was Chinese, Korean, etc. Toronto has many little ethnically diverse areas) and someone behind the bar tells us to take a seat anywhere. We gravitate towards the first tables near the window but with it beginning to snow we decided to go towards the back of the restaurant where more of the guests were sitting in hopes of it being warmer. Our waiter approaches us in a very rude demeanor and really paid us no attention. This continues as the food comes out. We had the lobster bisque which was Very Grainy and not all that good. The food comes out and it's 'blah'. The entrees and meal doesn't get much better. We had some veal item with onions on top and a dish with various meats such as pork belly and beans. We finished the meal off with a jack daniel? walnut crepe that was decent. 

At some point in the meal the waiter decides to speak to us and finds out that we are not Asians from the local area and instead tourists from the states. OOOH BOY, does this spark a 360 from Mark! He talks it up or perhaps it's because we're nearing the end of our meal and he's trying to work up a tip. Sorry to say, but it was a little too late buddy. 

In Canada, most places present the bill to you by bringing the credit card machine to your table. During our other experiences on the trip, the waiter would leave the machine and turn around for a minute to give you some privacy as you entered your tip amount and what not. Not at this place! You have to walk to the front near the door/register. Mark did not turn around and during the technical difficulty we were having as we paid, Mark made it a point to mention, \"In Canada, it is customary to tip 20% minimum.\" Well geez, now not only are you staring at what I'm pushing but you are trying to trick me into giving you 20% for being a jerk throughout our dinner and changing personalities on us at the last minute. I think not!

Not only is this place overpriced, but the food was subpar, and the SERVICE IS EITHER TERRIBLE OR BIPOLAR. I really wanted to like this place due to the ratings and the highlight it was given in our hotel magazine. This was the only bad experience we had on the entire trip to Toronto.

I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE GO HERE FOR GOOD FOOD OR TO BE TREATED JUSTLY!!!

P.S. Soda does not come out in a can, so you assume the restaurant would have free refills. Nope! $2.50/small glass and no mention of no refills on the menu."}
{"text":"Un très bon restaurant français situé à l'Est de la ville, pas loin du Chinatown de Gerrard et Broadview. Batifole est un restaurant sans prétention, très fréquenté par les riverains de Riverdale et d'ailleurs et qui propose une bonne cuisine française de qualité. Le chef, Jean-Jacques Texier, est un grand passionné de la table et il a su créer un petit bout de France en plein quartier chinois. Bravo !"}
{"text":"Who new Chinatown had a French restaurant?  Located in the \"Other Chinatown\" (East-End) is an intimate restaurant that has many delicious delights!   For such high quality food the prices are reasonable.  However, the strictly French wine list is pricey.  I would recommend having the Skate (fish)."}
{"text":"Not the first place one would expect to see a French restaurant (in the middle of old china town), but a great place. 

We are vegetarians and were skeptical of finding good veggie French food --but the chef (Jean-Jacques) is very creative and accommodating when we called a day in advance and asked \"What can we get if we are vegetarians\"--he turned it around and asked --\"what would you like to eat\". First time such an open honest proposition, we left it to the chefs imagination.

We enjoyed our appetizers and main dish--though the chocolate mousse was frozen in the middle--and the server said \"oh thats expected, its semi-frozen\".

Wine list is extensive and the ambience is perfect for a no-attitude is right. 
This is a place I will be visiting again and insisting the mouse be completely non-frozen :)"}
{"text":"A very lovely local French restaurant with a great wine list and wonderful French food.

This is a great alternative to Le Paradis which has nearly become a parody of itself.

Le Batifole is very authentic and warm. The food is carefully prepared and kept to a price range that is affordable. The cassoulet is remarkable, as is the duck. 

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We finally were able to try out Batifole and went for a special occasion. The service was exceptional: friendly and knowledgeable! Everything we ordered from the apps (escargot), to the mains (fish stew and duck entrees) to the fluffy and refreshing meringue dessert were delicious! The prices are very reasonable too for the care and quality. It was a quiet evening so that was even nicer."}
{"text":"It's funny how they dub themselves as \"the best French food in Chinatown\". They are that, but perhaps it's just a bad tagline.

We went on a Thursday with our Living Social voucher, and it was for a prix fixe souffle dinner. My wife, being allergic to eggs, had to go a la carte, and the server made a strong effort to accommodate that, even with our voucher. Our server was incredible to us all night, really.

Crab bisque: Hot, not too salty.  Went well with the bread stick inside that had a generous amount of delicious cream on it. I'd order it again.
Cold tomato soup: I don't like cold soups generally, but this worked.

Crab souffle: Savory, soft. Nice to have a souffle main!
Cassoulet: Very healthy meat portions that were tasty.

Marmalade & Grand Marnier souffle dessert: orange, sugar, souffle. Delicious.

Would come here again in a heartbeat.  Thinking of bringing my parents here, in fact."}
{"text":"J'adore Batifole!

What a weird location - a French restaurant in Chinatown - hahaha! I love it!

The Cassoulet is soooo good! Absolutely delicious. Hearty and rich and hot - a great meal especially in the colder months.

The duck 2 ways is also a tasty option. Crispy duck confit and seared duck breast is full of flavour.

The dinning room is small and can get quite noisy, but everyone is having a great time so you won't mind.

The servers have a little bit of attitude...but that's ok - it's a French restaurant - it's expected!

Check it out and bon appetit!"}
{"text":"Ou la la, Batifole is a charming French brasserie on the east end of Toronto. I fell in love with the eclectic French decor the moment I walked through the door! To start, we enjoyed the duck rillette and pork terrine, followed by crab and rock soup with garlic aioli and the duck two ways; confit leg & pan seared breast with calvados sauce, apple confit. After the dinner rush, Chef Pascal came to greet each table. He's an extremely talented and humble French man from Avignon, France. I felt like he was the type of man with whom you could drink pastis and play pétanque. Allez! Bon appétit!"}
{"text":"We will definitely go back!

Batifole is a lovely bistro in Riverdale neighbourhood, bordering East Chinatown.  If you like soufflé, this place should be near the top of your to-go list.  My orange-grand marnier soufflé was flawless with a dramatic height, a crusty and delicate top that cracked easily revealing the creamy yet airy centre.  It was devoured so quickly it never had a chance to deflate.  The savoury soufflés were good too, although you might have a tough time choosing between these and other tantalizing dishes.  We particularly enjoyed escargot with chef's special sauce, which we thought were superior to the traditional version with more depth in flavour.  

Decor - cozy, intimate

Service - knowledgeable and attentive

Menu -- short and focused, all small plates are priced the same, so are the large plates.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We were there last night. Food was not good. Whole night I couldn't sleep. Burned my stomach and back and forth washroom. It is not a busy restaurant. I guess food was not fresh. I will not go there again."}
{"text":"Came here one night for some French food. The food and atmosphere seem very authentic. The food was okay. The servers were very attentive."}
{"text":"My FAVOURITE restaurant in TO thus far! I'm a fan of all forms of cuisine, although it's no secret that I have a weak spot for French. The food here was classic French, not to mention there was a great menu of aperitifs that were great. For those of you wanting a recommendation, the horse tartar was brilliant. Don't be put off by the fact that its horse, just pretend it's super tasty cow :)

It was great having an amazing multi-course French meal in Toronto with an aperitif and wine and come out owing less than $80. I know $80 isn't cheap, but for quality food and good drinks in Toronto, it's really not that bad."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to have a dinner with my in-law family, who is sensitive to noise. We informed on this when we made a reservation, and we were taken to a table at a back corner of the house. It was nice and quiet at the beginning, but as more customers came in, got noisier to a noticeable level.

The meal was good over-all, but quite salty. I ordered a soup to start with, and after a first sip, I couldn't continue so I decided to return it. I have in my life returned a dish maybe once before. I called the waiter and while I was telling him it was too salty, my husband had a sip - then the waiter said to him \"you can't have another sip if you are returning!\" as if we are thieves. My husband just was trying to rescue the dish, if he could take it. I was quite embarrassed how the waiter assumed that we were trying to take an advantage of the restaurant.

Some dishes were really good - one dish with eggplant was remarkable. But I don't think I'll go back again for the saltiness of the food and unwelcoming attitude of the host (whom also had a bad breath)."}
{"text":"A sweet buzzy little french restaurant with impeccable service and a very interesting menu. The food is excellent but rich, so eat lightly the rest of the day and come hungry!

The baguette is made in house (I think) and is too good. We normally don't fill up on bread first but the texture and taste were irresistible. 

We shared the duck croquettes which were milder tasting than most duck and paired with peaches and a light chive dressing. Then had fish (so can't speak to the meat dishes).  Both were perfectly cooked, one with a mushroom cream sauce and one with a crayfish tomato sauce. I had fun trying one you never see on Canadian menus - the prehistoric looking but sweet tasting John Dory fish. 

The couple beside us shared a substantial charcuterie board which also looked like it would make a great lunch option. 

Dessert was out of the question. But lots of others in this busy restaurant seem to be indulging and enjoying it.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Setting an example for others. Selective menu with wonderful authentic dishes, reasonable prices, simple yet tasteful atmosphere. Service was genuine, pleasant and helpful. Wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Batifole loosely translates in English to \"frolic about\". And that's exactly the joyful experience I felt dining in this enchanting restaurant. Each course put before me was simple, fun, fresh and incredibly delicious. 

I started with seabass tartare. I was immediately transported back to sunny days spent in the the South of France. It was charming, delicate and divinely fresh. 

For my main I enjoyed the Croustade of Lamb confit served with a thyme jus. It was a piece of heaven. Perfectly balanced flavors. I couldn't put the knife and fork down. I became completely lost in the dish. 

My friend had Crab cake served with a fennel salad and tarragon beurre blanc sauce. It was simply done and looked phenomenal. I was also lucky enough to steal a bit of his Ribeye Steak with beurre maitre d'hotel. The one bite I tried was complete joy. If a dead animal can bring joy, this cow did that. Merci vache. 

Batifole was most pleasurable experience in a restaurant since visiting Toronto. The service is quick, but not so quick you feel rushed. It was such an intense culinary experience I swear I needed a smoke afterwards...and I dont even smoke."}
{"text":"The only French restaurant in China town. Dam what a shame. I was very excited when I was coming here. 
Bread and butter is always good, so when people were raving about the bread I thought #1 it would be allot of it, #2 it would be home made. From my experience, seems to be just a plain baguette that has been warmed in the oven. 

From their apps, their soup was the best thing out of the whole night. Well flavoured and great body. The snails weren't very good either, nothing special with the sauce. Would have been nice to get a little bread with it to soak it all up. 
Chicken parfait was not bad, the sugar coating gave the parfait a nice sweetness. 
The condiments went along well with it. 

As other people have mentioned, the mains don't live up to the apps. The fish lined with zucchini scales was under seasoned. (Some salt, it would have been great) And the mini asparagus on the veal plate seemed a little dainty. 
Presentation was a little absurd with full sprigs of herbs sticking out of the dishes. 

Fries were good (a little on the salty side), and the mayo was very good as well. 

Dam, I would love to come back, but I don't think I will. The only things that were truly good were the fries and the soup. 

Seasoning that night was the main \"problem\", everything was quite bland. 

And a couple of other things that threw me off were the pieces of paper acting as table cloths (A little tacky), and the left over Halloween candies they give you after paying the bill.

I can see why this is the best French restaurant in China town."}
{"text":"Charming neighbourhood restaurant with authentic French cuisine!   Loved the menu, great wine selection and the service was impeccable!"}
{"text":"I had a fish appetizer and a fish main course, and both were delicious. The quality was high, it was fresh, and skillfully prepped and presented. The bread was baked in-house, and really good. Even the butter was excellent. The desserts were fine. But overall the portions were small, and I left hungry. I hate when one has to load up on bread in an attempt to get filled up. I had a snack when I got home. I guess I could have ordered 5 or 6 things off the menu, but who wants to pay all that money. Even though the food at Le Batifole is exemplary, if you come ravenous like I did it might be a let-down."}
{"text":"I came here on a Living Social deal for three-course souffle adventure.  This restaurant is slightly off the beaten track...a French restaurant in Chinatown, but why not?

The FOOD:  We started with the soups.  The appetizer soups were pretty good, especially with the crab.  The tomato soup was rich and had a nice texture.  The main course souffles looked beautiful when they reached the table.  I had the Gourmand which contains pork belly and swiss....it read as an incredibly rich dish without much textural contrast. 

Dessert involved the Grand Marnier and marmalade souffle.  This disappointed me slightly.  I kind of think they forgot the marmalade and skimped on the Grand Marnier...i primarily got sweet as the flavor component with just the lightest hint of orange.

The SERVICE: This left a bit to be desired. Maybe they were just a bit busy with demand of being near the expiration of the vouchers, but we did have to ask for our glass of wine 3 times.  The meal took a lot longer than it needed to as there were delays getting menus, delays ordering, and delays paying. 

The ATMOSPHERE:  Tables are close together with some underwhelming decor.  It felt homely though in a fairly pleasant way.  Not fussy at all.

Overall, it was fairly good, and a bit uneven in terms of food and service.  With the voucher, it was so cheap, I can't really fault them.  Interesting enough that I might try it again, but not at the very top of my list."}
{"text":"OMG --- run don't walk to this delightful French bistro on Gerrard.

What a wonderful spot!
My hubby booked here for my birthday and it was wonderful.

I started with the Escargot Fricasse -- which means it is in a Tarragon Broth -- so not dripping in fat -- and unbelievably flavorful.  Loved them!

I had the duck both ways -- and if you love duck -- do not think about having anything else on the menu...  it was sooooo awesome.

My hubby had the Steak Frites and he absolutely loved it.

The chef came out and asked the diners how they were enjoying their meals.

The food and wine were just outstanding.  Do check it out, you will not be sorry!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic and unpretentious spot to have a delicious meal. 

My boyfriend and I went here last Monday and were wowed by the friendly service, simple and cozy setting, and the fantastic food. 

He had a veal dish, and I had the flat iron peppercorn steak in a demi-glace sauce after we shared the escargot. 

The escargot was a fresh take on the original plating and preparation of the dish, but it was a yummy creation for sure. 

The only thing that put me off a little was that our plates were very warm-probably from the use of heat lamps in the kitchen. I usually tend to steer away from heat lamp users-as it takes away from the freshness of a dish- but otherwise that, I have no complaints. 

Beautiful wine list, excellent service, warm atmosphere and incredible dishes-you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Oh, Batifole, how I wanted to still be in love with you.  Hubby and I returned to Batifole on a date night after 3 years and how things have changed.  

The restaurant has gone through a remodeling and a owner-chef change since our last visit.  The restaurant was not as dark as it used to be which was a welcome change.  But the renovations seemed to have done worse for the noise level and two of us seated at the bar still had to lean in to have a conversation.  

We arrived at the over-crowded restaurant (with a reservation) and sat down at the bar only to wait for another 10 minutes before anyone came to take a drink order.  Our server, Sophie, was very congenial and knowledgeable.  She assisted us with a wine selection that would compliment both our dinner choices of fish and pork.  

The new decor (since the current chef took over 2 years ago as we were told) is still comfortable but the entry was over-crowded with waiting patrons, we felt a little crammed seated at the bar.  

We shared a simple green salad and a dish of fois gras with sweet cakes for appetizer and had dory with sorel mushroom cream sauce and pork chop with raclett cheese and pork belly for our mains.  

The simple green salad was too salty and did not make a very good start to the meal.  The fois gras with sweet cakes accompanied by caper berry, beet relish and some gooseberry fared better.  Since the fois gras was so rich, it was perfect for sharing.  

My dory with sorel mushrooms in cream sauce came atop some sauteed zucchini and tomoatoe slices.  The fish was light and flaky and it went very nicely with the accompanying cream sauce.  My only beef with this dish was that there was no sorel mushrooms to be found in the sauce.  Instead, there were some other mushroom (most likely king oyster) chopped up in matchstick styles.  Oh well.  

My husband's thick cut porkchop arrived topped with a few slices of thick pork belly and was covered with melted raclett and some sauce resembling a gravy.  There were slices of potatoes underneath the behemoth of a chop that was cooked very nicely without being dry.  However, beware, diners.  This dish is really a heart attack on a skillet.  The chop with all the trimmings were so hefty and so rich that my husband who can easily demolish a few hearty slabs of prime rib with no issue had a difficulty finishing this baby.  The chop, albeit being tasty, was too rich for our gentle tummies.  :p  We barely finished our mains and had no room at all to sample the dessert.  

The verdict.  Will I return to Batifole again?  That's a big fat maybe.  Although the dining experience and the food wasn't really terrible, I just wasn't as thrilled with Batifole as I was when I first visited."}
{"text":"I grew up on a street about a 10 minute walk from this little restaurant. It popped up about 13 years ago out of nowhere on a unassuming part of Gerrard, just a little east of Chinatown. I Never paid much attention to it although I walked by it many times a week. Approximately 4 years ago, I have heard from a French family whose son had recommended them to go here... And it's been on my list since.Recently, I have moved back into the area, and I have chose this restaurant to have my birthday dinner with the bf!

Foie Gras Medallions: 4/5 ($24 ish?)
Anything with foie is delicious. To be honest, I was actually disappointed that it wasnt seared, but I guess I should have known that. I just think it's a shame because it would really elevate the dish. 

Beef Tartare: 4/5 ($?)
This was the BF's favourite. It is also one of the better beef tartares I've had, and I've had many. The portion was also quite generous.

John Dory special: 5/5 ($27 ish?)
VERY delicate, white fish served atop a white mushroom cream sauce. A bit similar to a very well-cooked cod... But even more delicate in flavour and texture. This was cooked PERFECTLY, and the sauce was pretty light and still bold in flavour. Definitely recommend it!

Duck Confit: 4.5/5 ($28 ish?)
Duck 2 ways- leg confit with smoked breast on top! Much better than duck confit I've had in another well-known French restaurant in the downtown core. The breast was smokey and tender with just a hint of fat to balance the texture, and leg wasn't too salty but was very tender. Sauce was a great compliment! Recommended for any duck fans.

Service: 3.5/5
Polite service and patient with explanations of dishes. However, nothing spectacular or beyond any other service in other places. The extra .5 was bumped by the chef whom visited each table to make sure the food was good. I really appreciate that.

Overall, I had an amazing birthday meal here. I am glad I finally visited. This restaurant is recommended to anyone who wants a simple classic French meal.. not the new age stuff."}
{"text":"Do you remember the last time you ate something truly unique? Something creative, a place where the menu makes you say: \"Seriously?\"

This is it ladies and gentlemen. If you are looking for convenience or the feeling that you are in an upscale downtown, go to Canoe. If you are looking for one of the best dining experiences of your life, go here. Don't ask the chef what is good. He designed and made all of the goods, and, frankly will think you are an idiot for asking. Get something truly exotic, your taste buds deserve it."}
{"text":"We loved the vibe.  Found the food pretty good - but overall very expensive.  Our total was 180 with tip.  1/2 bottle of wine, no desserts.  1 app and two mains.  Cassoulet was okay, the pork belly was tough.  I asked for no butter (lactose intolerant) and my steak came butter free but the side beans were covered in butter.  Tartar was also tough."}
{"text":"I really like this place. When shared with a good dinner guest, it hits all the right notes for a truly satisfying meal experience: cozy ambiance, friendly staff, good wine, and great tasting food, including fries and bread with the most delicious butter. Mmmm.  I could go any time."}
{"text":"What a great find. A hip and cozy atmosphere with top quality French fare. I went with a group of 7 and we were served by the incredibly warm staff; felt like dining with family. It feels like each piece of decor in the room carried some sort of significance. Glassware of a country feel.

A nice selection of French wines! 

The appetizers were excellent. Pâtés and confits of different textures and flavours. You'll ease in to the cuisine with the familiar fries and tarragon mayo. 

I loved my \"cassoulet\"; a stone dish of beans, sausage, cured pork belly, and duck. A homey stew with three vastly different tastes of meat. I wish I had a sort of bread along with the dish, but I blame my group for devouring the first baguettes that made it to table. 

We didn't try the desserts, seeing as the restaurant had actually accommodated us an hour past closing time and still served us wonderfully."}
{"text":"I visited for my birthday.  It was one of the best restaurants I have been to.  The staff were very accommodating with us switching tables as I wanted to sit closer to the musician.  The selection of wines was perfect.  The food recommendations and selection was impressive without being overwhelming.  Finally, the chef came out personally to make sure everything was okay.  I am truly happy to have experienced this gem of a restaurant."}
{"text":"Near the intersection of Gerrard and Broadway is not where one would imagine finding a bistro like Batifole, espcially when they opened in 2004 (or was it 2005?). After all, it's a neighborhood with plenty of joints for Pho and Dim Sum but the Chef/Owner Jean-Jacques Texier presented you with simple French home cooking.

The appetizer, entree and desserts were uniformly $8, $18 and $6, respectively. But not so uniform was the quality of the food, some definitely a culinary delights while others you would be better off doing without.

The rabbit terrine was an unwise choice to start a meal with. The cold meat was coated in solidified fat, having the same texture of butter that came right out of the fridge. I suppose it was an insult to say I liked the accompanying gherkins better. On the other hand, the escargots were meaty but not too heavy, piled on a slide of bread that soaks up the tomato sauce nicely. The cream of Jerusalem artichoke topped with saffron foam was creamy and flavourful while the plate of shellfish didn't standout either way.

The entrees were just as uneven. The veal steak in a cream and white wine sauce was overly rich and lacks in flavour. However, one would be crazy to pass off the braised beef cheeks, kept warm in a pot of beautifully clear stock that complemented the tender meat and wintry vegetables perfectly. Quite average was the cod fondue in a leek sauce. Feeling more adventurous in spirit, I had also tried the horse tartare. It comes pre-mixed so I had no idea what goes into the seasoning. There was a side of capers, which ended up being slightly overpowering, partly my fault to putting them all in at once. The meat itself was rather creamy, nothing as tough as I had imagined.

The desserts fall somewhat short of expectation. The crème brulee was the standard fare, good but not outstanding. It took two people on staff to explain what the pot au chocolat was. \"Is it like pot du crème?\" leave our waiter scratching his head. The answer coming back being \"like a pudding, but baked\" hardly qualified as satisfactory. The actual dish was somewhat rich (not a bad thing at all), and slightly bitter (the burned taste, not the chocolate bitter).

Yet, food alone didn't complete the dining experience. The servers at Batifole were as friendly and down-to-earth as the country-style food. After not knowing how exactly the pot au chocolat was executed the first time, our waiters were knowledgeable in the subsequent visits (except coming back to inform us they ran out of one dish after we placed our orders)."}
{"text":"Exquisite French provincial cuisine expertly prepared using fresh ingredients!!! Don't let the exterior fool you; simply superb!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant, chef and waiters! 

The food is really good, especially the fish specials! We had some special requests due to medication and they did their best to accommodate to our needs.

The atmosphere is also great, cozy and perfect for a lovely dinner :). 

I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Four stars but only just.

My brother and I went out to Batifole for his birthday dinner. We're both French food neophytes and we wanted to try something different. The food, service, and atmosphere were all good but nothing blew us away.

The menu is small and has a simple pricing structure: $8 for appetizers, $18 for mains, $6 for sides, and $6.50 for desserts. They brought delicious complimentary bread to our table. Not sure if this is house made or not but it was one of the highlights of the meal for me. Our orders:

Appetizers:
Escargot ($8): Not your typical escargot. I liked it but perhaps not as much as other reviewers. It's only served with two small pieces of toast so save some of your bread for the escargot.

Pork Belly and Lentil Salad ($8): A few pieces of pork belly on a bed on lentils with an awesome maple dressing. I wasn't a huge fan of the lentils themselves - a little boring - but overall the dish was tasty.

Mains:
Horse Tartare ($18): This was the first time I've ever had tartare of any kind and I wasn't a huge fan. I didn't find it gross - I like my meat rare - just boring. You get half a dozen pieces of toast, various garnishes (mustard, mini pickles, carrots, caramelized onions), and in the centre of the plate what looks like a uncooked hamburger patty. The toast was great, but the garnishes were boring, and the horse was seasoned with mustard (unfortunately I don't like mustard). I blame myself for not liking this dish. I'm sure it was prepared well it just wasn't what I expected. My rating ignores this dish.

Cassoulet ($18): As my brother said \"it's like classy franks and beans\". This was my favourite dish. Duck, pork belly, and sausage cooked with white beans and a delicious sauce. Simple, hearty, and delicious. The portion is huge and there's a ton of meat.

Sides:
Fries ($6): Amazing. Thick, salty and served with a delicious tarragon mayo.

Dessert:
Lemon Crepe ($6.50): Two crepes with butter, icing sugar, and lemon. FYI: the lemon is not lemon curd or spread but, I think, lemon juice. This was a very simple dessert that complimented the rich meal well. Among the best crepes I've had."}
{"text":"After seeing such amazing reviews, I figured this place would be unreal. Maybe my expectations were too high because it really didn't meet them. The service was unmemorable, a bit slow but quite polite. 

The food was mediocre and not quite filling enough for the price. I ordered a fish broth main that sounded amazing on the menu, but was served salty fish in warm water that was simultaneously overcooked and falling apart on my fork. Well seasoned though and served in a short mason jar so points on creativity.

Appetizers were good - we had the cheeseboard and venison tartare. It's nice that you can't mess up charcuterie.

Overall a bit disappointed with the experience, wish I could have enjoyed it as much as other Yelpers, but would not be going back to try it again."}
{"text":"Batifole basically sold us on moving into the neighbourhood. We went to look at a place, went to Batifole, then signed a lease. 

The food is excellent. The bread is possibly the best bread in the world. A friend with a gluten intolerance said the pain she suffered the next day was worth it to eat the bread. All the dishes I've had there are fantastic, and I'm a huge fan of the bouillabaisse, and the escargots are so yummy (my boyfriend has a rule that if the dish is labelled \"my father's recipe\" on the menu we have to try it. This one actually lives up to it). 

The menu can be a bit limited. I tend to gravitate to the same things due to lack of variety and I wish they would have more specials. The service is always friendly and they're really not snooty about anything. We wanted to try some cognac but had never ordered it before, so we asked the waiter to recommend something, and they did, with no judgement. (The cognac was excellent, by the way.) 

We've moved out of the neighbourhood, but I'm sure we'll still wander over once in a while when we're craving French food."}
{"text":"My actual rating was 3.5.

Batifole has been on my \"to do\" list for a while.  Saturday night my foodie partner in eating crime and I popped in for some eats.

The first thing I noticed is the interior didn't seem to match the outside of the restaurant, or at least what I imagined it would look like inside.  From outside, the place looks really charming and cozy.  Inside it was very clean and organized, but somehow I found it could use a little more character. I know it's maybe unreasonable, but I wanted to feel transported.

We both ordered the lobster and rock-fish soup which was by far my favourite part of the meal. And the bread they serve is absolutely delish.  A perfect compliment to the soup.  For my main, I got the beef tenderloin.  It was tasty, but it didn't really knock my socks off.  My friend got the cassoulet and she enjoyed it but I didn't get the sense that she wasn't wowed either.  We shared an order of fries which were good.

All in all, it was a decent meal; our service was very good so that ups my rating."}
{"text":"Great little spot, inside the decor makes you feel like you are in a French bistro in France. The wine list has lots of options. To start I ordered a steak tartare and a ratatouille. Both were delicious, the ratatouille was different as there was a soft boiled egg inside, what a great idea as it balanced the dish. 

For my main course I order the cassoulet it was very rustic and flavourful. My date ordered the duck 2 Ways and it was well cooked and delicious. 

I didn't order a dessert but overall the service, food and dining experience were fantastic. The best part is it is a little less known and less commercialized."}
{"text":"(unspoken thoughts during my meal)

I never eat butter with bread.  I never do.  It makes people fat.  Oh my god THIS TASTES GOOD.  This is why people butter their bread!  Oh my god I'm going to be so fat AND HAPPY.  

My soup!  That's some good timing...

Ah damnit my wine glass is getting empty- WHOA!  That waiter was all over it!  Scratch that.  Back to drinking.

Okay so I went into this thinking I'd be all \"on a date\" and take like two bites and feign fullness but if that bastard thinks he's going to try one more bite of my soup?  I'll fucking kill him.

This plate is so gorgeous!  It's so dim in here, goddamnit! I can't take any good iPhone-food-porn pics for Twitter, but man does my date look nice.  Everyone looks nice.  I bet I look really nice.  This place makes me totally want to-

MORE WINE!  Yaaaaay!  Good thing he's focusing on how good his stupid-meaty dish is.  I don't think I've looked up since this plate came out.

My good god this is French food; this is fantastic."}
{"text":"Im not a big fan of the chairs and tables which looked more like a company employee cafeteria
than a bistro.
The food is creative and well executed with real sarrazin crepes and creme au chocolat to die for
!  Sad they do the souffles only at lunch three days a week.
Its the kind of place where you'd be glad to return the other menu items (and the creme au chocolat again)."}
{"text":"Batifole is absolutely incredible. I've been there many times and they always impress me. We had the French onion soup (which was a featured special) which was domed with a golden gruyere infused puff pastry, it was delicious and looked beautiful. We then had the steak tartare, scallops special, and frites. The combination of flavors in the tartare is the best in Toronto- the perfect amount of Dijon and capers. The scallops always cooked perfectly and sat on a tasty layer of mushrooms. We also had the cheese plate which always has a unique selection that I cannot find anywhere else. 

The service is always fantastic. Damien (who served us last night) and the rest of the staff are so friendly and helpful. They make the experience even more enjoyable. You can tell they are passionate about the food and wine they present. 

Finally, Chef Pascal Geffroy always greets us to see how we are enjoying the meal. It is always great putting a face to the food!

We have been to France many times and I can confidently say if you love French cuisine you must come here. 

Thanks Batifole."}
{"text":"Going to eat out on the west side is really a painful process nowadays. Unnecessary attitude, hipster service, road closures, lacking of parking, super expensive...

I am still looking for another joint on the east side that I can frequent. House on Parliament is definitely my number one. I have tried a few places east of the DVP, but nothing really. Il Ponte is a fine place, but it is time to look for another one. 

Many years ago, I came across a bistro in the middle of east Chinatown. However, I never had a chance to try it. Last night, I finally did. 

All the signature dishes were well executed. Specifically, the fish soup and seafood stew were excellent. 

However, I have to say that the dessert I ordered, boule de neige in English sauce (condense milk) was exceptional."}
{"text":"Went to Batifole tonight with 4 of our friends for a dinner after golf. I had been assigned to \"pick a good place\" so I went to Yelp and searched the areas east of the DVP. Lots of interesting little places but Batifole jumped of the page with many good reviews. 

We'll add one more. I had made the reservation for 6 at 7:45 and we arrived on time to find the small place buzzing. But front and centre was our table for 6 just waiting for us to sit down. The waiter was quick to set us up with water and menus and then let us jabber away before coming back to answer any questions about the menu and take our orders. 

I should say that this a small Family run business which suffers a little from it's own success. With only 2 staff out front aided by the Owner/Chef who also brings out EVERY dish himself it can get a tad slow with the service. However everyone is pleasant and truly makes you feel at home. And then there is the food. Oh! The food!!

I had the Canard a l'Orange which was perfect. I started with the Terrene de Maison which was exceptional and my wife had a fish dish I cannot remember the name of but she raved about it. The he other people had a variety of dishes all of which were excellent. 

In summary, if you arrive here in the right frame of mind (namely relaxed and wishing to spend some serious time absorbing the feeling of a genuine French Bistro) you will be rewarded with a meal that will motivate you to write an epic review like this one. 

Do it. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"J'ai restaurant français dans le quartier chinois. Je suis allé récemment et j'ai bien aimé. Batifole fait tant de choses à faire cuire la nourriture très bonne, bon service et prix très raisonnable. Ils ont ajouté bouillabaisse au menu, et que c'était comme si c'était du sud de la France. Le bouillon était parfumé au fenouil, et les poissons et les moules étaient parfaitement cuit."}
