{"text":"This place is seriously underrated. Service very polite. Pricing was fair. Food was very good. I didn't leave hungry."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times since they opened a few months ago.

It's clean, friendly, and the food is very good.  My favorite is the Pork Adobo.

And the Lumpia."}
{"text":"Filipino food in Pittsburgh!  Actually, Ambridge to be precise.

I am so ashamed of myself for not getting here until today.  This place is amazing.  As a Filipino myself, this place reminds me very much of home cooking.

I ate in for lunch and started with the lumpia - just think of an egg roll but without all the cheap cabbage.  Minced beef, carrots, celery and a sweet chili dipping sauce.  Delicious.

And for lunch, chicken adobo with white rice.  This version is more of a red sauce with potatoes - not as vinegar-y but still right on.

Friendly folks in there and delicious food plus the price was right.  I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"Excellent food great prices wonderful owner. Any time I'm in Ambridge I always stop in."}
{"text":"Unreal. 

Friendly people work here. I got chicken with rice and fresh veggies and it was amazing. Cheap prices too. Unreal. Came in starving and left so happy."}
{"text":"There is nothing fancy about this place - it is just good food, reasonably priced and great people!  I stopped in for lunch and ate myself silly on Pork Adobo and Lumpia.  Awesome!  Ashamed to say I haven't tried their BBQ yet, but will very soon."}
{"text":"Sorry to say, Nelias did not live up to the other reviews.  The restaurant is hardly a finished room, let alone comfortable.  Very greasy ribs.  Pork Adobo with potatoes??   Everything is homemade and the worker was nice, but that's it."}
{"text":"Did I eat at the same place that is getting 5?star reviews?  Just had the WORST meal in a LONG time.  First, the place is dirty, random papers and supplies are all over the place.  No soap anywhere to be found in the bathroom, which is disconcerting given the standard \"employees must wash hands\" sign.  Gross.  Ribs were reheated, but only a bit so some were cold.  They tasted baked, fatty and NOT authentic bbq.  Pulled pork was really tough.  Hard to finish, in fact could not finish it.  The lumpia appetizers were also difficult.  Cheese ones are filled with a velveeta like substance.  Meat ones had an off flavor, ammonia like.  We each had a bite of each kind and simply could not eat any more.  SO disappointing!  We were really looking forward to some authentic bbq or any type of Filippino food, but were treated to a nightmare on a plate.  In fairness, the fries were good."}
{"text":"Wouldn't give it one star if I could. This place was disgusting,  should have left but gave it a shot and wasted $13. Baked beans were from a can, potatoes, blah, and the ribs were inedible! Hope the health department visits this place soon!"}
{"text":"I came here with CM for dinner at around 6:30pm on Sat.  After a longer-than-expected hike at Raccoon Creek State Park, we were both quite hungry.  Rather than heading back the way we came and paying homage to the mecca of chain casual dining that is Robinson, I suggested that we venture a bit out of our way to check out what is, to my knowledge, the only restaurant in the greater PGH area that serves Filipino food.  Given that CM is of Filipino heritage, he was eager to try it, as well, so we headed over to Ambridge.

Upon seeing that Nelia's serves lumpia and chicken/pork adobo, CM became very excited, since he rarely sees these dishes offered at restaurants.  Because their standard lumpia contain ground beef, which I don't eat, we split the order and got 6 beef and 6 fish (salmon) lumpia.  For entrees, we ordered the chicken adobo and chicken on a stick.  They also offered kaldereta, a pork-based stew, but CM nixed it, since he's not a big fan of Filipino stews.  Finally, I ordered a glass of the fresh squeezed lemonade ($2.50).  I don't remember the exact prices of everything, and I forgot to take a picture of the menu, but our total check came to $22.50, which I felt was quite reasonable for the amount of food that we received.

Unfortunately, despite his enthusiasm, CM wasn't able to try the food on the spot, since he is very susceptible to motion sickness, which hit him from the hilly drive over about 10 min. after being seated.  However, I was, and in general, I was favorably impressed.  Of the dishes I tried, my favorite, by far and away, was the chicken adobo, which was extremely flavorful and savory.  The chicken consists of all dark meat chicken, which CM informed me is quite typical of this dish.  When he tried it the next day, he said it was even better than his mom's version, which I took to be high praise.  The chicken on a stick, which consisted of a skewered and stretched chicken breast drizzled with tomato-based BBQ sauce over a bed of rice, was not bad, but nothing particularly Filipino or special (perhaps it's supposed to be a faux/Americanized Filipino dish?).  The BBQ sauce was rich and had a good flavor, though.  The fish lumpia consisted only of fish and rice, and lacked the carrots and cabbage that lumpia typically contain.  Because of this, they were rather bland, but the sweet chili dipping sauce added some welcome flavor.  According to CM, the beef lumpia were good, but not quite up to the standard of some others he's tried before.  CM said that the lumpia and chicken adobo were definitely very authentic for Filipino food, defying his expectations for ethnic food from Ambridge, PA (of all places).

Overall, we were pleased with the quality of food and service that we received at Nelia's.  As others have mentioned, the ambiance is definitely no frills/hole-in-the-wall, which is my favorite type for restaurants serving ethnic food.  Re: cleanliness, the bathroom had soap in the dispenser and was acceptably clean during our visit, and I didn't notice any cross contamination (though I wasn't watching the whole time--then again, if I was going to get sick, that would have happened by now, since it's over 24 hrs. later).  The owner (Nelia) is quite personable--as we were leaving, she struck up a conversation with CM about his heritage, and upon hearing of his motion sickness ailment, advised him to drink some soda to settle his stomach.  If you happen to be in the area or are seeking a new type of food to try, I'd definitely recommend stopping by Nelia's for some Filipino specialties, and supporting this great little restaurant."}
{"text":"The ribs were delicious and the meat falls off the bone. The chicken on a stick with fried rice was pretty good as well.  I certainly will be back the food is reasonable and there is a variety of food to choose from.  They have different specials on different days of the week."}
{"text":"I go here for the filipino food they serve which are great. The adobo chicken or pork is yummy, the lumpia is delicious and the chicken on a stick is a must try. 

I have also tried the BBQ ribs and it was good. 

The owner and everyone else there are very nice. The amount you get for the price is great, definitely try this place out and maybe  if your feeling adventurous for a different cuisine then don't hesitate to try any of the filipino food they offer."}
{"text":"Filipino Wednesday's can't be beat! Great food, even better prices.

And if you are thirsty on a hot day, the fresh squeezed lemonade cannot be beat."}
{"text":"This place isn't fine dining. It's barely a sit down. It is terrific BBQ and authentic Filipino food. The owner, Nelia, was busy with several large catering orders but talked with me the entire time. She also offered several samples of different menu items to try for free. The pulled pork was as good as any I've had. The bun was smaller than average which I liked because I don't want to be filled up from just the bun. The fries were fresh cut. She has a homemade vinegar dipping sauce with hot peppers, garlic, and ginger which I couldn't get enough of. The lumpia were delicious. She has homemade strawberry basil lemonade which was out of this world. 
Fancy place? No. Great food and excellent friendly service? Yup!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here a couple of Saturday's ago with my wife for dinner.  We had read about Nelias on Yelp and had been looking forward to trying it.  Whenever we pulled up to the restaurant I have to admit that it wasn't exactly what I was expecting.  It was fairly small with a picnic table and large smoker in front.  The doors to head into the restaurant were made of streamer-like plastic.  Once inside we were facing the kitchen, a cash register and a soda cooler.  There was also a dining room next to this which I never did see since we ended up sitting outside at the picnic table.

Since my wife and I were both interested in trying both the BBQ and Filipino food here, we decided to split a number of things.  We ended up ordering a half a rack of ribs with sides of fries and linguine pasta salad as well as a chicken on a stick with white rice and then pork adobo.  This was after we tried ordering fried rice instead of white rice and also chicken adobo instead of pork adobo, both of which they were out of.  After ordering we went outside and took a seat to wait for our food.  The first items out to us were the fries and pasta salad.  The fries looked like they were freshly cut, had a nice seasoning on them and tasted great when hot.  Meanwhile I wasn't expecting much out of the pasta salad.  It ended up exceeding my expectations though and was much better than expected.  As we were eating those two items our ribs came out next.  The ribs ended up being pretty good with the ones near the end of the rack being a bit tougher than I would have liked while the ones in the middle were falling off the bone.  Last but not least our pork adobo and chicken on a stick came out.  It looked like they had the exact same sauce on them so I was surprised by the very different flavors between the two.  Both of them ended up tasting really good and having tender and moist meat.

The bottom line for me is that I would head back to Nelias again in the future.  I don't know that I would make it the only reason to head out to Ambridge but would definitely give it a shot if you are going to be in the area."}
{"text":"Would just like to add that this place has the best potato salad. I know some will not like it but to me it's great. Appears to be home made also."}
{"text":"Okay, you need to experience Nelia's with an open mind.  When I went, there was literally nobody in the building.  A sweet older woman who didn't speak very good English came in, gestured that I should stay, and went across the street to get an employee.  Maybe not the most professional thing in the world but whatever, it kept things interesting.  I would take another star off for this because I was there way longer than I wanted to be, but the pork adobe is SO GOOD.  Can't get it anywhere else around here.  

So Nelia's, here you go, have your 4 stars.  Just don't go here if you're in a hurry, or even if you want to eat in.  Get your adobo pork to go and enjoy it.  Just know what you're walking into."}
{"text":"Literally just finished our meal, it was outstanding, I had the half rack of ribs with fries and linguine salad and my wife had the fried chicken salad. First thing I'll say is they do not hold back on quantity, it was a ton of food I'm known for eating a lot and I had a good bit of leftovers. Second, it was outstanding, the ribs were very tender with a perfect amount of bbq sauce and the meat came off the bone easily, the fries were terrific, not crispy, not soggy and perfectly seasoned, I didn't have to chug a bottle of water after I ate them either. The linguine salad, was decent, didn't knock my socks off but I don't go to places strictly because they have linguine salad, so no harm, no foul. I didn't try my wife's salad, but she's the pickiest eater, seriously, she'd send her food back if she was in a concentration camp. Yet, she didn't have a bad word to say and I didn't catch her \"hunting\" for the good stuff as I so often do. So that in and of itself is a damn good review. Definitely recommend, a nice little gem in Ambridge!"}
