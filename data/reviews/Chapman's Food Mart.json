{"text":"A very good pizza joint near the Old Castle in Lorain. It's just a regular convenience store from the outside, but the inside has multiple hot food choices to serve your needs. We ordered pepperoni pizza, a calzone, and a chicken dinner with jo jo fries. Great prices and plenty of food. We have visited twice so far and the food has been consistently good."}
{"text":"We have been twice and more than happy both times.

Typical convenient store, with a nice hot kitchen with plenty to choose from... Pizza by the slice, whole pizzas, chicken, subs, etc.

First trip: we each had the Italian sub (hot) and split an order of chicken tenders & jojos.  The Italian subs were great!  We were more than impressed.  For an Italian sub, it was as good as it gets.  The jojos were decent... Good size, ok flavor.  The tenders left much to be desired... Too bland for our liking.

Second trip: we each had the Italian subs (of course!) and split a snack pack (4 whole wings & 2 jojos).  the subs, they were as good as the first time!  These subs are probably 8\", not the biggest but, big enough and with great flavor!  The jojos were as they were the first time but the wings were delicious!  Much more flavor then the tenders.  On our next trip, we'll go for a mixed bucket of chicken for sure!"}
{"text":"I was recommended Chapman's for their chicken. I must say, I consider myself a picky chicken eater.... I've gone to far east side of Cleveland, one Cleveland, looked at the Travelocity recommendations and must say I am in love.  I called in to get prices and the young lady who answered could not have been more accommodating and pleasant. When we picked up my daughter mentioned, wow, what great customer service. Then I got home and taste tested....all four of us agreed  yum yum yum. A wing  yum, a breast yum, chicken leg yum. I'm going back...."}
{"text":"Good pizza whether you order or are on the go. You can't beat the 4.99 lunch special. Great subs, hot or cold."}
{"text":"A convenient store with a good hot kitchen. You can either order a pizza or sub or you can take advantage of their hot and ready pizza by the slice. There is a sign on the deli cooler that says if you spend $20 in groceries you get a free pizza. I'm not sure if that's for any grocery items in the store or only items from the deli. 

I have been going here for years and there have been a lot of different employees over the last 10 years. I have never had a bad customer experience at this location though. The staff is always very friendly. Especially for some of the people they put up with on a daily basis since this place isn't in the best area. 

I do highly recommend this place for the pizza by the slice if you aren't too uppity to visit a store in a low income area. There are some sketchy looking characters around sometimes but nobody has ever bothered me in the 10 years I've been going there. Everybody just minds their own business and moves on just as it should be. 

So stop by and grab a few slices of pizza and don't forget to get a Cold Classic Glass Bottled Coke to go with it."}
{"text":"Chapman's is a nice little convenience store in a neighborhood across from a boarded up house in Lorain.

The two people I've encountered working there are the friendliest people you'll meet. The young man is the cashier and the older lady works the kitchen. They make a great team.

The kitchen serves up hot, made to order pizzas (also available by the slice), subs, fried chicken, and jojos at very reasonable prices!  Fellow Yelper, Darren R has been raving about the delicious Fiery Gauntlet sub for a while and he has reason to because that sammich and the Italian sub I've tried have been really tasty!  They come loaded with savory deli meat and cheese sliced fresh in house with fresh, crisp lettuce, tomato, and onion finished with a smidgen of creamy Italian dressing, nicely toasted on a seasoned hoagie roll...all for around $4-$5.49.  
I've had the pizza by the slice and it's pretty good at $1.69 for one slice or $2.99 for two slices!  You can order a whole pizza any way you'd like it too. The fried chicken looked really fresh and juicy also. Maybe I'll give they a try next time after I'm off my clean eating kick.  This last visit was a cheat meal, I swear!"}
