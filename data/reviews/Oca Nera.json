{"text":"This is real Italian food, best in Toronto. Everything is handmade and homemade including their pastas! Love being repeat customers"}
{"text":"Surprise find in woodbridge. Fine cuisine, custom wine glasses, friendly staff.  A bit pricey.  Would like to see prices for the specials.  Even though it's classified here as kid friendly, I'm not sure how. The food is great though."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Vaughan.  Hands down. Don't let the location fool you.  These guys are serious foodies. Just drop your cash at the door and do the tasting menu and post you menu. Right on Corey and Walter"}
{"text":"I had heard many good things about this place so we decided to give it a try   Being Valentines day there was a set menu so my review really is not on the full day to day menu  the atmosphere lets say for an above average Italian restaurant wasn't as expected not sure why but from what i had heard was expecting a little more in the decor etc    We had sampled the gnocchi, spaghetti a meat and a fish and shared all the items   all the items were good, nothing special or out of the ordinary flavor wise but the plating was nice  That said I will update my review after my next visit with the full menu in place.  I would have no problem referring this restaurant to anyone"}
{"text":"What a great experience. Great pasta and lambs. Older, experienced staff. Small place filled with good vibes and musical entertainment. Well organized establishment. You will need reservations for dinner most nights."}
{"text":"We've been here twice now & both times were incredible! Wally (owner/matre D) has a real knack for knowing what we like & want. He's always great at pairing drinks with our meal. We don't even ask, we just say bring us wine (white or red) and he always brings us what we like. He takes great pride in his restaurant & has the largest wine & spirits collection I've seen in a restaurant anywhere in Vaughan. Food is delicious! We have tried the fried calamari with fried zucchini strings, the shrimps wrapped in pasta & fried, the squid ink pasta with seafood (my favourite), seabass, and other fish specials. First of all, this is the only restaurant that I have tried in MANY years that knows how to cook mussels. They are plump, juicy & not overcooked. Most restaurants cook them so much that they become tasteless and tiny. The whole squid ink dish is delicious & the mussels are yummy. Loved the calamari/zucchini dish. The chef puts love into the dishes & presents them perfectly. Everything we have had has been yummy and we were happy with the dish. The dessert at the end of the meal is a nice added touch & much appreciated. As for the decor, it's not your typical trying too hard decor in vaughan. This place is down to earth, clean and doesn't need to wow you with the decor, it does that with the food, drinks & ambiance.  Thank you Wally & we'll be back!"}
{"text":"If we didn't know it was there, we'd never know... Located behind a gas station on Islington we find one of the more inventive Italian chefs, Corrado Giliberto, whose virtuosity enables classic Italian cuisine with a twist. Forget about filling up on gas; we prefer wild boar gnocchi, espresso lamb chops and brick-pressed free-range chicken. A signature dish and must-try, is crisp spaghetti-wrapped shrimp with a strega cream emulsion-a delightful confluence of cultures, textures and flavours. While the menu changes, one staple is the house rotating selection of Rodney's oysters. Branzino, served crisp, is crowned by crunchy lotus root and yuca chips, and sits atop a chowder of seafood and pork belly. Every nuance of this dish sings. For dessert, a light mascarpone-filled chocolate ravioli.   Amore!"}

{"text":"Hidden treasure. The menu and wine selection was amazing. The live musician was also a wonderful addition to the already cozy atmosphere. I lovedthe lobster and brie mezza luna. Yum! Great restaurant for a special dinner!"}
{"text":"Nothing here but a good experience. Appetizers were excellent especially the mussels and shrimp wrapped with noodles. Calamari also great. The outside of the restaurant is a bit deceiving like others mentioned but don't let it fool you.  Inside has great ambiance, there was live music when we went there which was on a Friday night but I don't know is that is a regular occurrence there or not.  I had the steak which was cooked perfectly, there is also a live feed of what is going on in the kitchen. Never saw that before but I guess it keeps staff on point."}
{"text":"Was very impressed with the food quality and service. Great wine selection. It has been a challenge to find good restaurants not in the city but this restaurant was top notch and will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Must stop here everytime we are in the area. Food is incredible and you can get lost for an entire evening in this place."}
{"text":"When my Yelp Friend texted me telling me that Oca Nera is behind a gas station, I don't really know what to expect. But even gas station in this hood is cuter and have Country Cottage vibe.  Oca Nera is a hidden gem serving classical Italian dish with a modern twist. Daily specials is designed around fresh and seasonal ingredients.   We ended up sharing:  Signature: Crispy Spaghetti-Wrapped Shrimp, Strega Cream Emulsion ($14) Risotto: Seafood, Chantrelle BC Mushroom ($22) Pasta: House Made Casa Reca, Rendered Sausage, Roasted Egg Plant, Topped with Garlic Rapini ($23)  Everything we ordered were excellent from freshness of ingredients, complexity of taste, techniques in cooking and plating.  The restaurant is quite busy during lunch hour and service can be a little slow with just 1 waiter and an assistant.   The decoration is modern but cozy. Great for all occasions especially if you have a birthday to celebrate!  I definitely will be back. I still have to try out their dessert!"}
{"text":"We heard good things about Oca Nera. Getting a reservation proved difficult as the earliest we could get was over a week out...this proved to be tantalizing as it was an early indication of the popularity of Oca Nera.  We were greeted warmly at the door and after giving my name was adressed by name thereafter. Table was excellent and we were immediately given fresh buns with olive oil and balsamic vinager on the side.  The menu was explained, specials were vocalized and a lot of attention was given to us regarding any questions we had. Service was amazing...  We had oysters and the Signature Strega as appetizers. Sooooooo good and so fresh. The side sauces for the oysters were amazingly paired.  For our mains I ordered the Wagyu steak and my wife ordered the Nera Mare Ã‰ Terre dish. Both were amazing and presented new tastes to our paletes.   One of our friendly waiters, and part owner,  then brought us a free sampling of the chocolate pasta (ravioli) stuffed with melt in your mouth cheese.  I enquired about their Amaro list and was guided to a good choice. Amazingly I was also given a superb Amaro sample (full serving) on the house to compare.  We finished with a cappuccino and expresso while listening to the live guitarist.  I highly recommend this restaurant and we will be going back for sure.   Roy"}
{"text":"After shopping at Vaughan mills, trying to decide what to eat, this is the place comes off with good rating, and it amazes me too. Hidden behind the gas station, well there was a fuel truck at the station blocking the view too. There's live jazz music playing, romantic dinner, the butter poach was the best, it melts in your mouth, I was in butter joy in the hours to come.  Appetizer include oyster with quarter of exotic sauces, love that spicy vodka sauce. Server claim it has the best calamari in toronto, yea! She was right! Totally coming back for more"}
{"text":"Come visit this wonderful restaurant.  I'll be coming back to try the other dishes.  Thanks we had an amazing night!   The live music from Giordano Cattonar is incredible!    Thanks Oca Nera for a great night!"}
