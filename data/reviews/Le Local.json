{"text":"This was the worst service experience I have had in my entire life. Stopped in mid afternoon on a hot summer day with my wife. We were hoping for a drink and a small snack. Before we were seated the manager informed us that they were only serving the tapas menu, which was fine, and we expressed our desire to order food. There was one other table occupied inside the restaurant and we had the patio to ourselves. Apparently our waiter had to cut his smoke break short to attend to us. He came and took cocktail orders and said he would give us more time with the tapas menu. At no time on this 30+ Celsius day were we offered or brought water. When our drinks arrived the waiter placed them on the table, turned around and disappeared back inside immediately and without a word. We assumed someone would return, but were ignored on the patio. We sipped our drinks and eventually finished them. After several more minutes of waiting my wife went inside to tell them we were leaving. The manager offered to send the bill out. The waiter brought it out with a charge for French Fries that we didn't order. He told us it was Quebec law that their liquor licence required a food order. We told him we intended to order food, but didn't have the opportunity as he never asked us. We also told him we had no intention of paying for food we didn't order. He told us we could wait for the fries or not, but we had to pay for them. He lied and said he asked twice if we wanted to order food. When we refused again to pay for what we had not ordered he told us we could pay or just be thieves. We asked to see a manager. When the manager arrived the waiter continued to lie and say that he had asked twice if we wanted to order food. When we told the manager that this wasn't true he grabbed the bill, crumpled it and told us to \"f$!& off\". The manager was extremely apologetic and very nice. He comped our full bill. However, I cannot recommend strongly enough to not go anywhere near this place unless you appreciate comically rude and terrible service. It was like something out of a contrived Food Network show."}
{"text":"Loved it.  Took my sister when she came into town to visit.   She said their Ceasar was fabulous (nice touch that they freshly grate the pepper... it does make a difference). I enjoyed the Jack cocktail made with artisan tonic water gin and cucumber. A bitter toned drink that was insanely refreshing.  The service was seamless and at a relaxed pace. At no time did we feel rushed and it was a perfect pace to enjoy conversation. If we were in a hurry we might have found it annoying.... but we were not... we were there to relax hang out and enjoy. Our waiter had a good sense of humour and was very patient with us. And his recommendation for wine with dinner was spot on.   At the table was had the beet salad and the carpaccio as a starter. The flavours were nicely balanced and the unexpected twist on both dishes were really wonderful... for the carpaccio... they had fried capers... wonderful crunchy salty little buds of goodness which added a nice textural element. For the beet salad... it was the deep fried egg. The crunchy texture, wonderfully seasoned, which released a perfect soft cooked egg.... it was really fantastic.  For the mains.... we had the U 10 scallops and the fresh snow crab with porcetta. The broth with the crab dish was perfectly balanced... but my honey was slightly disappointed that the crab was shredded rather than in distinct pieces. This did not detract from the enjoyment... except that next time he would prefer to have the scallops... which were large tender perfectly seared melt-in-your-mouth goodness. Veggies were perfectly cooked and the pureed beans underneath were a lesson in making pureed veggies taste so good. Don't let the grey tone put you off... you might be tempted to lick your plate when you try it. We had great fun joking about the unexpected pleasure of eating gray sludge. It was terrific.  Dessert. We tried the cannoli - nicely made... but the texture of the filling was that of a very fine cream... we are more used the a \"meatier\" filling closer to the texture of ricotta ... but it was still tasty. The ice creams were terrific.... smooth creamy and flavourful... but the star of dessert was the dark chocolate with sea salt pie served with pistachio ice cream and orange salad.  The candied citrus rinds were exceptional-I could eat them forever... the pistachio ice cream was smooth and heavenly and provided a wonderful counterpoint to the chocolate pie. It is not an exaggeration to wax poetic on the chocolate pie. It was easily one of the best desserts we gave had in a long time. If you go make sure you have room for this.  In fact consider starting with it so you will have room.... ;)  The restaurant is fairly expensive but worth every penny. Everything was on point even when it differed from expectation of what might come ... we would not hesitate recommending this gem.   Although the next time we will sit in the restaurant side so we can watch the action on the open kitchen."}
{"text":"La carte propose un menu style bistro assez ordinaire. J'avais un meilleur souvenir de ce restaurant. La nourriture est bonne et de qualité, mais bon, ça manque de panache. Dommage, car c'est un lieu agréable."}
{"text":"I came here on a visit to Montreal for work. This is definitely a place that does not make you feel like a tourist. I am glad we found it! Their sweet cream onion soup on the appetizer list was delicious. I had the beef tartar which was also great.   The reason I give this place 4 stars is because it did not overly impress me, the menu options were very limited 4-5 options for the entrees with 2-3 of them being raw dishes. I love to eat food, but would have liked to see more of a selection."}
{"text":"Part of a large group in the private 2nd story room!  Service by Alex was impeccable. Each appetizer and entree was a treasure!  The homemade marshmallows for dessert was amazing!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited Montreal for a couple days to celebrate our anniversary and his birthday. We chose Le Local for dinner our last night for 2 reasons: great Yelp ratings and reviews, and its late hours (on a Sunday!). Boy, we were not disappointed! The restaurant is snugged in a quaint small area of Old Montreal near a couple of other small mom and pops restaurants. Our server was not only hilarious, but fantastic. He recommended the halibut for myself, and tartare for my boyfriend. We both were very pleased with our meals. The lobster roll appetizer was also very delicious. In addition, our waiter also asked us what brought us to Montreal and my boyfriend briefly mentioned it was our anniversary and I (very subtly) mentioned it was also his birthday the night before. Although it was close to closing time, we were not rushed at all. After our meals, we awaited our checks and to our surprise, our server brought out an array of cute little dessert treats placed on a cute wooden cutting board with sparklers in regards to my boyfriend's birthday. We were both so pleasantly shocked! What great service this man provided us! We won't forget this place. Overall, the food was fantastic and the service was truly exceptional. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was delicious! The room was clean, and well decorated. The waiters were friendly, and spoke English and French well. The atmosphere was great. There were many rooms, and where we sat, it was quiet and not to crowded, but we walked through the other room that had an open kitchen and was a little louder but still pleasant. The food was amazing, and really good quality. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Sister and I were very very happy with lunch today at Le Local. We left very full, vowing we'd be back. Lunch table d'hote menu was choice of 4 mains for $25 including choice of green salad or soup (minestrone today). Salad was field greens with many 1/2 cherry tomatoes nicely dressed with Local dressing. Sister loved minestrone soup, lots of different crispy veg, perfectly seasoned. Great start. Mains were Nordic shrimp on buns with homemade potato chips and salad; calamari tagliatelle; a pork dish (that I can't recall in more detail); pan roasted melt in your mouth med rare salmon with crispy skin on a bed of silky smooth rich puréed parsnip, mini cauliflower florets, sweet little raisins mixed into faro that just popped flavour from each bite. We both LOVED this dish! Finished with way above average coffee. No room for dessert. A side note on the service, ordered our mains but after 10 or so minutes we were told one was no longer available so sister chose salmon. Our waiter was very apologetic and said he'd \"fix\" dessert for us but we were too stuffed. Much to our surprise were only charged for 1 order of salmon! Throughout the meal, waiter and maitre d paid us lots of attention, water and (excellent) bread/butter continuously replenished. Once the construction across the street is done, the terrace out front will be sweet!"}
{"text":"Tres bon restaurant. Super ambiance avec sa section bar a l'entree du resto. Pour les mordu du foie de veau, il faut absolument le commander. Tres bonne selection de vins avec une charmante sommeliere pour bien nous recommander le bon accompagnement des plats."}
{"text":"Good food, good wine (selection and quality). The gnocci and beet salad are amazing.   That said, it is a bit pricey considering all the other fantastic options for delicious food around Montreal..."}
{"text":"From the outside you wouldn't realize how big Le Local is.  It's very obscure looking, but it was a treat to eat here.  The atmosphere suggests a very trendy place.  However, you see a wide range of different types of people eating there.  The music is definitely techno, so if you can't stand that sort of music then it could be a problem.  There is an extensive wine list so be prepared to have to choose! For food, I ended up getting the beef liver with beans and grainy mustard mashed potatoes.  The liver was accompanied with a shallot marmalade.  The mashed potatoes were extremely good and mustard add a different dimension to the taste.  The liver was cooked pretty good, slightly tough in a couple areas but overall nicely done.  Liver is something that you either like or don't like cause it has a metallic taste to it, but if you are a fan of liver this was worth it.  My only gripe is that it is a little too dark inside for my tastes, but that adds to the hip and trendy vibe to the place I guess."}
{"text":"Tourists love this place. Most Montrealers think this place is average at best, unless you're a little bimbo who thinks you're participating in some \"scene\" by being there.   The food is pretty good but the experience is ruined by idiot waiters making $5 an hour who treat the patrons like garbage, crowding them at the bar, ignoring them, and then berating them when they try to select the appropriate bottle of wine. Which, I might add, I don't think any waiter in there could ever afford on their salaries.   Now I try not to judge a place on one visit unless it's really good, so I gave it another chance and went back a few months later. Same bullshit experience. Then again, a few months later, for someone's birthday. SAME thing. I was starting to think it was just me, until I asked around and most people have the same negative experience.   It's a bit of a shame, really, because the chefs are talented and the decor is pretty. Too bad about the insecure waiters."}
{"text":"When my mom came to visit me in Montreal we went to Le Local for my birthday and it was one of the most amazing meals of my life! It wouldn't be a place that I could afford to go very often, but when my parents want to treat me to a great meal, this is always my first choice. I made some excellent meal choices, I would highly suggest the grilled octopus salad, the duck leg confit, and the banane et chocolat to finish it off. It was a lovely meal, and we were so lucky to enjoy it on the beautiful terrace as the sun set! Everything was cooked to perfection, and it is an excellent place for adventurous eaters because the menu is quite extravagant."}
{"text":"Le restaurant Le Local ne cesse de ravir mes papilles. Que ce soit au midi ou le soir,  la qualité de la cuisine saura vous surprendre agréablement. Les assiettes sont présentées de manière soignée et sont alléchantes. Les saveurs se marient et se succèdent de l'entrée jusqu'au dessert. Pour y avoir été de nombreuses fois,  on est toujours aussi émerveillés par cette délicieuse cuisine! Le service est hors pair et n'hésitez pas à demander à votre serveur plus de détails sur un plat,  il saura vous mettre l'eau à la bouche. Les plats du jour offre souvent une option intéressante et de saison. Les cocktails sont savoureux et travaillés et vous pouvez les demander en version virgin.  En groupe,  on peut s'installer dans la salle privée au fond du restaurant et c'est très beau avec sa grande table conviviale. Je recommande pour une belle soirée,  une bonne table et un expérience sans reproche!"}
{"text":"On a weekend getaway from the city, I went to Montreal to visit James, along with my parents who were also visiting (who happened to stay in the same hotel, on the same floor, a happy turn of events). My parents usually pick the restaurant in the chosen destination BEFORE they even book flights or get a hotel, so the fact that they decided to drive up to Montreal before picking the restaurant meant only thing: serious google mode to find the best restaurants in the area.  Some background info on my parents: come to one of our family meals and at breakfast, it's \"what do you want for lunch... tomorrow?\"; and at lunch, it's \"so do you want an heirloom tomato salad or farmer's market corn for dinner?'; and at supper, my mom asks, \"would you like lemon ricotta or blueberry pancakes for breakfast?\" They love to eat. End of story.   All that google research paid off. They found Le local and booked us dinner on Saturday night. We gobbled up solid great food that didn't take itself so easily. If there's a category of unsnobby casual food, Le Local would be on the list. For instance, my dad ordered the \"dirty bombay sapphire martini\" salmon tartar and out comes boozy marinated-salmon with two green olives on a toothpick stuck right in the center. It made me smile. Three perfectly puffy buckwheat blinis with salmon roe reigned in the silly factor with just the right amount of panache.  Likewise, my mom ordered grilled organic salmon for her main course, complete with an array of garnishes, including a not-kidding-you, a whole head of Romaine lettuce split down the middle with a Caesar dressing and croutons. It was ridiculously impossible to eat of course without a second plate, but it gave me pause for thought: this place gives French-driven food a good rap. It's not fussy or over thought, but it still delivers on flavor.   My menu options were equally delicious. Having never given vegetarianism a day's thought, I ordered two hits: the Canadian beef carpaccio (with truffled, salted herb tapenade, peppery arugula) followed by milk-fed calf liver with a whole grain mustard mashed potatoes and crisp haricot verts. My food was nicely seasoned, hot, and cooked well (although I might prefer medium rare liver next time). As for James, he was quite happy with his choices and pleasantly surprised with his baby rack of lamb.  All in all, excellent meal. Good friendly service, not too loud, comfortable open kitchen seating, worth visiting Le Local even if you are one... a local that is."}
{"text":"The duck confit with bitter orange puree(?) had the best combination of flavours I ever had. Thank you!"}
{"text":"The sommelier made very good recommendations on the wine.  The beef carpaccio was good, the duck leg was tender and the ravioli was excellent.  Overall solid, just wasn't blown away by anything."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I gathered here for a late dinner while visiting Montreal. I had requested on Open Table for a \"good table,\" and the staff accommodated us nicely. The ambience is very lively and hip, with great music and perfect lighting.  We started with a seared foie gras on gingerbread, which was A-MAZING. I can still taste that fatty goodness! Then I moved on to my entree, steak frites. My steak (which I ordered medium rare) was unevenly cooked, with nary the bloody goodness I expect from such a temperature. The frites were very tasty, albeit a bit soggy. My friend ordered the veal shank, which she said was overcooked, too. My other friend was totally digging the scallops dish she got, especially the puff pastry and chorizo bits.  For dessert, we shared Le Brownie, which was the perfect piece of chocolate heaven.   The meal had seemingly ended on a high note until we saw one of the young chef helpers MAKING OUT with his girlfriend in full view of all of us diners. I mean, really? Or am I being an American stick-in-the-mud? The intimacy was just a little TOO much...bit nauseating, actually.  So.......they get 3 stars."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Had the cod special with a pea purée and sautéed vegetables...cooked perfectly! Kids had salmon filet with a beautiful assortment of fresh vegetables! ! My best meal in Montreal. Dessert was really good-choc lava cake and caramel pots de creme, yum!"}
{"text":"Food, atmosphere and setting were lovely, but unfortunately service was shockingly disappointing. I don't care how 'busy your Friday is', if you don't have enough servers to serve tables, don't seat additional people. As someone who had a reservation, I was sad to receive the following service: It took 20 minutes to receive a menu and water, then 45 minutes to get our first drink. We eventually had to go order at the bar, because of the lack of service. Then, it took another 30 minutes to receive our appetizer and 45 minutes after that for our main course to arrive. We had ordered as soon as we possibly could after we arrived. The server was apologetic, which was kind, but that's simply not enough. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"Le tartare de saumon est excellent! Bel ambiance. Je recommande chaudement. Cuisine ouverte sur le resto, sympathique de voir les chefs se démener."}
{"text":"First time to Montreal and after 6 nights of various cuisines we were directed to Le Local for a \"nice\" Montreal meal. Nice hardly describes my exerience, Spectacular would be a better description.... Had dinner their two nights in a row... There meals are excellently prepared, and presented. The ingredients were FRESH, tuna cooked perfectly as was the portugese steak, pasta and salads.   The waiter staff were professional and knowledgable of their menu. I don't speak a word of french and was treated with courtesy, even with my lack of linguistic skill. We sat inside, mood was modern, good background music, a very pleasant atmosphere to drink nice wine and dine on superb food, this is what I was hoping for in Montreal food, the best meals on this trip by far. I can see where the \"trendy set\" would want to hang out here, I am far from one of those, I only want to eat at excellent places and have zero interest in \"being seen\".....  Do yourself a favor, when in Montreal and esepecially \"old Montreal\" dont pass this one by."}
{"text":"Decor is nice and the servers are nice, but food was overpriced and low quality.    We had steak, mackerel salad, and duck confit.   Medium rare steak was tiny and tough. The frites were a dark brown mess that sometimes taste burned.  Mackerel was flavourless low quality.  Confit was made with equal portions of duck and salt.  The espresso creme brulee was interesting (personally dislike but not bad quality).  Oh yeah, we had poutine side order cuz how can you screw up poutine... It was little better than fast food restaurant.    You can come here for a few glasses of bottled stuff but don't come expecting quality food.  Every other 4-5 star place in this area was better based on our experience.  So maybe the main chef had an emergency and the boys slacked off that night but since we can get the same items elsewhere with higher quality... Why risk it here."}
{"text":"We went to Le Local for an early dinner when our parents came to visit. The food is really well made, fresh ingredients. Friendly and attentive staff. I am not crazy about the decor, but the place is definitely comfortable and pleasant. After our meal we had some coffee, unfortunately their coffee is not good. Way too hot and bitter. But other than that I have no complains."}
{"text":"I ate at the bar here on a business dinner; I am not a sophisticated eater but the menu was too fancy for my tastes.  They also serve the smallest glasses of wine I have seen.  The decor was great but for the price, I would expect much more (especially when NYC is a 1.5hr flight away).  My veal burger and glass of wine came to $40 pre tax and tip."}
{"text":"En plus, serveur était vraiment doué ce soir la, et sympa."}
{"text":"Wow!!  This place is so cool.   We had a group for dinner in the private dining room upstairs.  I had an amazing yellow beet salad with truffle oil followed by steak with potatoes gratin - cooked to perfection.  The cute servers took great care of us.  Later a few of us went downstairs for some bubble at the bar.  This place has a killer wine list with prices that are completely fair.  I know wine is more affordable in Quebec than Vancouver so I shouldn't complain except that too many restaurants triple their wine mark-up and don't offer enough interesting choices in the affordable range."}
{"text":"Wow. One of the best meals I've had in a long time.  Service was nice and attentive.  I don't speak French, but the waiter worked really hard to make sure I understood everything he said. Although I really should have brushed up on my French before going.  Beautiful restaurant. Awesome decor that had a nice trendy industrial look, yet felt very comfortable. We brought our young child and we're treated very well.   On to the food. It was the best I've had overall at a restaurant in a while.  We didn't order a bad dish. We split the octopus salad. Just do it, you won't be sorry. Had a fantastic grilled flavor and good balancing accompaniments.   I had the duck leg. Sometimes I find duck too heavy, but this wasn't.  It was really good and again well balanced. My husband had steak tartar,  which he devoured quickly.   We finished with a cheese plate and choco banana dessert. Dessert was a chocolate bourbon bread pudding with banana gelato. Again, great balance of sweet flavors without being disgustingly sweet.  Cheese was really awesome. My husband said the blue was incredible.  He usually shares everything with me, but only gave me a bite of it because he liked it so much.  With tip. This included two drinks as well. So reasonable. Don't wait to go. Just go!"}
{"text":"Le thon fut divin avec du foie gras et le service impeccable.  Norte serveur nous donnais des instructions comme is nous ne savions pas ce que nous allions manger... Certain aurais pu en être insultés Mais c était fait avec tant de bonne fois et délicatesse que c'en était \"cute\".  La carte des vin est trop grande.  La musique lounge est super bien dans cet endroit  Bonne expérience avant Le théâtre.  On y retourne?  Probablement que non.  Pas parce que c est pas assez bon Mais plustôt pcq y'en a plein comme cela à Montréal.  Si on est dans Le coin on s y arrêtera car on n y sera pas déçu"}
{"text":"Superb food and really good service. We had to wait quite a bit to get our food, but we were a fairly large group (10+) so I didn't mind. If you can't decide what to eat there, just go with the chef's choice, you won't regret it. The place is a bit pricey though."}
{"text":"We went to Le Local on the advice of the internet, and it was a great find. The atmosphere is just about anything you want. There seem to be three large spaces with different vibes going on in each room. You enter into a bar/lounge space, walk through a separate dining area that looks into the open kitchen and finally there's a quieter dining room in the back. We sat in the back, which worked out well for us.  The food is really quite good. We started with cocktails and appetizers, which ended up being the highlight of the meal. We shared the beef tartare which was very well done and delicious. But the real winner was the beet salad. Beets seem to be everywhere these days, but this dish was amazing. Obviously, we didn't try everything on the menu, but the beets are not to be missed.  After that, we had the arctic char which was good but not mind-blowing. The scallops were very good. A great blend of flavors and textures.  All in all, it was a fun night and a great, random find on our trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere in a am area of old Montreal where you wouldn't expect a restaurant.  Great fois gras appetizer an steak frites (almost went for off menu special of filet mignon with torched food GRAS on top for the FG duo). Steak cooked perfectly and fries had good crisp. Lots of better restaurants in city but worth checking out for the eclectic menu and great location/atmosphere."}
{"text":"Good portions, especially compared to the same type of establishment you'd find in NYC. On the pricey side, service was a bit slow on a Saturday night, but overall very romantic. Scallops with foie gras are highly recommended. Bring a flashlight for reading the menus, and of course your appetite."}
{"text":"Great food, great service and great wine.  We stuck to - variety of starters that included calamari, hummus, beef tartare, salmon tartare, fries and crab cakes.  All dishes were excellent.  The sommelier was a great help with the wine choice and just a quick note about our first round of drinks - the mojitos - they were one of the best I have ever had.  We ended the night with a small desert tray of 6 items which were perfect.  Ambience, music, service was top notch."}
{"text":"I like the look and feel of the industrial space meets high end dining.  Locally sourced food. I had the  \"Beet salad with truffle oil and goat cheese, panko breaded egg, bacon\" to start.  I know, it sounds delicious.  I am in love with that panko breaded egg.  The chef is a master with the deep fryer... as evidence by the fried mac and cheese.  Deserts were original and yummy.  Fresh homemade marshmallows lightly toasted; campfire food all grown up.    The only down side is the service was disjointed.  We had several servers during the meal which normally is a good thing, but we it just seemed like no one really owned our table and we were left to our own devices for long periods of time.  I would certainly had more to drink if I had been asked more often if I needed anything.  I always  say yes to more drinks.  However, the servers were all really great."}
{"text":"\"Christine R\" definitely saved the day for these tourists.  Le Local gave us a really nice romantic dinner on the edge of Old Montreal.  Although the food is on the expensive side Le Local provided us with a delicious meal and a fantastic atmosphere.  You can easily make a reservation online, and I recommend that you get there early so that you can hang out in the bar for a bit.  They have a really spacious cocktail lounge up front with some outdoor seating.  After dessert you are close enough to the rest of Old Montreal that you can have a nice walk to the waterfront or Place Jacques Cartier."}
{"text":"great date night before Christmas with excellent food and service, wine is pricey but for the location its expected.  So try it with your loved one or impress a new date well worth the bucks."}
{"text":"My husband and I made a reservation based on a yelp review while on a weekend getaway yo Montreal. After spending a full day doing touristy things, this was a nice change of pace. The restaurant had an edgy vibe but was still warm and inviting. We were very tempted by the option to have a chefs creation at any course, but we decided to stick with the menu and ordered the duck and halibut. Both were artfully composed and delicious. I ended the night with another detailed dish, Chocolate and banana, which had a nice balance or flavors and textures. I would highly recommend this for a nice treat in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Outstanding!   Went for dinner with my boyfriend and everything about this restaurant is perfect.  The service was impeccable.  The waiter was friendly and knowledgeable.  He made suggestions from the menu and for cocktails--nothing disappointed.   Now for the food.  My mouth is still watering just thinking about the meal.  We shared 2 apps and 2 mains.  For the starters we had the crab cake and the beef carpaccio salad.  The carpaccio melted in your mouth.  Easily the best carpaccio we have ever had.  For mains we had the steak and the salmon tartare.  Both were phenomenal, we cleared our plates.    The ambiance of the restaurant was warm and modern.   Truly an outstanding dining experience. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Awesome place to go for dinner with friends. It's loud, fun, and the food is great.   Have had both Tartares (salmon and beef). Both probably the best I've tasted in Montreal. Especially the beef tartare which comes with this whipped buttery sauce that you could just eat all day long.   Will definitely visit over and over again."}
{"text":"One word comes to mind - Pretentious.  If you want to know what going to Le Local feels like, pull out a few $20 bills, spread some butter on it and eat it.  Wash it down with some water and pretend you just drank a cocktail.  It amazes me that this place has over 3 stars, especially after eating at various local restaurants in the area.  After a week of dining in and around Montreal (Vieux Montreal mostly) I can safely say this place is one of the most expensive places I visited and had the worst food overall.  How do you screw up Poutine??  For those that don't know Poutine, it's a local favorite in Montreal, combining french fries with cheese curds, topped with delicious gravy.  And somehow Le Local found a way to screw up this simple recipe.  My wife and I bought two drinks (a Mojito and a Martini) and they were both diluted to the point where it was hard to distinguish it from plain water. Oh, and they were $10+ each.  Needless to say, we didn't order another.  Next up - the bread.  I rarely ever comment on bread, but it was so terrible I feel the need to warn others.  For a restaurant that charges as much as it does, having stale bread that tastes like you're chewing on someone else's gum is just unacceptable.  How about serving some freshly baked bread, preferably something with flavor?  The only saving grace was the Veal Burger, which was pretty damn good.  Not good enough to warrant the price, but it was good.  I don't even remember what my wife ordered - it was some odd tasting fish that she didn't eat.  Overall this was a giant skid mark in an otherwise splendid trip to Montreal.  Save your money and go somewhere else.  Anywhere else.  It's hard to find something that's worse."}
{"text":"We had been poking around yelp trying to find a place to have our Anniversary dinner at and decided on this place.   Made a reservation on a Saturday night. Get's a bit busy but not crazy.   Really nice ambiance, not too dark, comfortable chairs. Really great staff, and our waiter was attentive but not annoying.  I had a mojito, the sweet onion soup, the pressed duck confit and the \"chef's treats\" for dessert.  The boyfriend had the beet salad, the flank steak and the same dessert.   Mojito was great and served in a science-y beaker-flask type thing. Well made and not cheap on the rum!   The beet salad is the thing to get. I'm jealous of my boyfriend getting to eat that panko crusted poached egg, but next time I'll be sure to get my own!  The duck was perfect, and was paired with some sauteed mushrooms, watercress salad, a poached egg and a caramelized onion puree.   And he LOVED his flank steak with bbq butter!  For dessert the chef's treats were perfect, cute little sampling of desserts/treats.   All in all a great experience, and for once I don't have anything to complain about.   I will def be back."}
{"text":"The food and service was decent however the decor was so dated. I feel like I went back into the early 90's. They need a serious update."}
{"text":"We just came back, went for the Mtl à Table event. Wanted to go back since 3 years! We had the Mtl à Table menu : $41 three-course meal. Everything was delicious, very fresh, tasty... Service was excellent and very professional as I remember being. But a lot of salt in both appetizer and main. Id suggest to the chefs to put a little less salt; so unnecessary... Deserts were amazing. Had the lemon pie - \"oh yeah!!\" (My tummy says). Not disappointed."}
{"text":"Location: Well if you really want to know, Le Local is located in the middle of nowhere and you definitely need a car to get there. I'm not sure that you can use transit. Street parking is available - some is metered, some is not (if you park under the overpass, it's free). There's also residential zoning in the area so be sure to pay attention to the signs.  The place: I think the space itself is an old manufacturing space (don't quote me on that). It's very spacious with a large terrace (that I did not not visit, as it was -34 with the wind chill!), and offers a great mix of old meets new. You've got your wood, brick and glass, all set up in what I would consider an industrial/urban setting. I had heard talk of an expanding dining room section that would be situated in the 'house' section of the restaurant, and I think that was done, as I frequently saw patrons walking through the kitchen - I can only assume there was a dining room back there.  The food: OK, so first, I had Le Local bookmarked for ages before I finally got around to going. While my brother was here in December, I sent him over for dinner and he absolutely loved it - he never raves about restaurants OR takes pictures so this is saying a lot. There is not one thing that I ordered, that I can complain about. Not one.   Cocktails: I ordered the Strawberry Caipirinha (Leblon Cachaça, lime, strawberry purée, brown sugar) and it was delicious. They weren't cheap on the liquor either! Despite the strawberry purée, the drink wasn't overly sweet. My date ordered the Mojito and equally enjoyed her drink.  My appetizer was the beet salad served with truffle oil, goat cheese, a panko breaded egg and big, fat pieces of bacon (pretty sure it was homemade). Loved this. They used yellow beets that were perfectly sweet, the bacon was fantastic - I mean, seriously - if you like bacon, ask for a side of it (=-D. I couldn't really taste the goat cheese, however I enjoyed that. I find that many restaurants overload beet salads with goat cheese to the point where you can't taste anything else. The salad was a great starter - the portion was generous, but it was light enough to not fill me up. My date had the chef's inspiration, which consisted of cauliflower, salad, mushrooms - I don't recall the exact ingredients but it was delicious.  My main consisted of U-10 roasted scallops (minus the smoked pork shank), on a black bean purée, with squash, Brussels sprouts and broccoli, reduced cream and truffled egg yolks. Wow. All I can say. The scallops were perfectly seared, tender and juicy. The broccoli was to die for, with just a hit of caramelization, and the purée was perfect. This was a fantastic dish. My date ordered the salmon and also really enjoyed it.   For dessert, I ordered the chocolate tart with sea salt, orange salad and olive oil, along with a homemade (I think) pistachio ice cream. I only have two words: F**king amazing. The candied orange was incredible and I wish they sold this in a very large bag.   Service: The hostess who greeted us was friendly, and there were no issues with the reservation that I booked online through their web site (they send a confirmation email the day before - just click the link to confirm that you'll show up). Our waiter was nice, though I did sort of feel that he lacked interest in our table. That said, he took the time to explain the items that were not on the menu, as well as give us plenty of time to think about what we wanted to order. There was no pressure to hurry up at all, and we appreciated that. My only negative comment (if you want to call it that) is about the location of our table. It was right in front of the (open) kitchen, on the corner, and close to another table. Thus, there was A LOT going on around us - waters coming and going, the chef calling out orders, it was very loud, and one of the waiters was frequently behind me when he served the other table and let's just say space was limited.   Price point: On par with other establishments of this caliber. For cocktails (x1), appetizer, main, dessert + tea + tip, you're looking at approximately $80."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner Monday night (in July). It was reasonably easy to get the table early in the evening - the restaurant got filled very quickly, especially the outside seating space.  Our first dish was fresh mozzarella salad, which was not bad, but mozzarella ball was not soft and creamy enough, at least not to my taste.  My main dish was that evening's special, rabbit - that was an absolutely delicious dish, with perfect seasoning and beautiful presentation. For dessert I decided to go with one of the local cheeses, goat cheese called Pyramide, which was tasty and well presented with various condiments.  I do have one gripe though, and it is well overpriced wine list. The cheapest wine starts from $49, which makes no sense, and lots of selections are grossly overpriced - this is a very big drawback for me, a real put down on the experience.  Service was good, reasonably prompt.  Recommended for food, but for the better experience, you can either skip the wine or be very judicial with your selections."}
{"text":"I came to Montreal with my Fiance and asked the concierge at the W for a good restaurant nearby. He offered some suggestions and I asked him \"what's one of the best on Yelp nearby?\" He knew right away about Yelp and went on the page scrolling down for me to see. He suggested Le Local since the Pied de Cochon was booked solid and he mentioned Chef Charles-Emmanuel Pariseau is a notable Montreal Chef so it sounded perfect to me.    We enjoyed a nice 5 block walk and found Le Local in a quiet brick building covered in beautiful Ivy.  The pretty hostesses greeted us and were ready to seat us.   There was the bar straight ahead as you walk in and cosy sofas in the open room on the right with Black and White film playing on the brick wall.  I loved the chandeliers in the restaurant they were Modern Light- Bulb industrial ones.     We sat at a wooden table for two near the Black Velvet Curtain that separated the dining room from the Bar/Lounge area.  In Front of me was the open kitchen where I can watch the chefs rush around creating the masterpieces.  The whole place was buzzing with happy friends, romantic couples and dim  lighting.   The waiter came by and welcomed us, he seemed very busy and was short with us.    The Food Runner was attentive and kept our glasses filled with water, and offered a selection of nice breads offered in a bread basket.    We decided to share the app Warm cumin-orange goat cheese, grilled Naan, tomatoes and Lebanese cucumber, mint pesto, smoked almonds and Baba ganoush(12). The waiter suggested that it was small and we should order two, but we enjoyed it regardless and savored every bite. The presentation was beautiful, it was displayed on an artists Palate.  I can really taste the orange zest and the Grilled Naan was just chewy, crispy outside and just delicious appetizer.   My  Fiance ordered the Roasted grain fed chicken, potato rösti, spinach, mushroom sauce, grilled corn & pop corn (27). He's ordered Roasted Grain fed Chicken before but this portion was waay smaller. It was very good and what sold us on the dish was how they use popcorn! It was a very cool concept and the popcorn married the dish perfectly.   I ordered the grilled \"AAA\" Flank steak, spiced BBQ butter, fries and salad (27). Wow it was a huge cut of Steak and I never saw flank steak this thick! Yes I gave a portion of my steak to my hungry man and he enjoyed it very much. The Homemade fries were browned and crispy  just how I like them, and the mixed baby greens had a good vinaigrette good portion and accompanied the dish very well.    We had a Romantic anniversary Dinner here,  why I gave it 4 stars is the waiter's chaotic vibe and the portion size was very small for the price.   **See Photos**"}
{"text":"Went there one time with my boyfriend on Valentine's Day, the food was delicious, expect the appetizer was a bit salty, and the server didn't want to change it, I had to drink 2 cups of water to finish that appetizer and we weren't really happy about this one. Overall the environment is really good and romantic, recommend for couples and family to go there, the music is classic jazz style and really calm, good for soft group talking and enjoying the food and environment at the same time."}
{"text":"This was my wife's favorite place in Montreal.  She loved the salmon tartare and the people watching.  I had the escargots as an entrée and they were so good that I was excited for the main course.   However my \"Portuguese style\" steak, which I had ordered rare arrived well done.  I hate sending food back, but it was inedible as served.  I only knocked off one star for this as they replaced it quickly and it was cooked perfectly the second time.  The wine list was OK by Montreal's standards."}
{"text":"We came here after a dinner at a restaurant not too far from it. We wanted just some good drinks. At Le Local, we had to order 'food' with our alcohol, but dessert counted as food. So that worked! The dessert portion was tiny, so it's not for sharing.  We wanted more of a dessert cocktail, which we didn't see on the menu. Their drinks menu looked good, btw, but we just wanted something sweet. The waiter recommended the chocolate pear martini, which apparently used to be on the menu, but for some reason it was taken out. I think they should put it back on the menu cuz the chocolate pear martini was delicious :-)   The ambiance was lively and trendy! The place has a nice decor and fun vibe - quite enticing. The service was all right, but our drinks were delicious! I'd definitely come back to eat here."}
{"text":"So how are the duck hearts? what do you mean? have you had the duck hearts? yes. So how are they?... that's the first impression of the service. so I had the salmon mousse, it was very good! The hanger steak was well presented but lacked something. Desert was OK... overall not bad but nothing special!"}
{"text":"Le Local puts a delicious and trendy twist on French/Québécois cuisine, the kind of rich and refined meal that's perfect after a day of hiking around Montreal. The main dining room is adjacent to the open kitchen, so be forewarned that it gets pretty warm. There's a huge, full-length mirror on the wall opposite to the kitchen, so everyone can watch the chefs in action. Everything my wife and I had for dinner was delicious: the beet salad, salmon tartare, the grilled halibut and duck leg confit. Also, if you want dessert, it might be best to share an appetizer since the dishes are healthily portioned. I don't know how often the menu turns over, but this was a perfect summer meal; a nice balance of freshness with buttery goodness."}
{"text":"My discovery of the year. For the posterity, it was elected 2nd best resto in Canada by En Route Magazine for 2008.  My love and I went to Le Local for my 1st anniversary and had a blast. We were looking for a hip place, with ambiance without being the fake merde of St-Laurent (you know, the really really expensive places where they hire models but forget to train them about service???), where we could enjoy creative food, without being broke for the next year to come.  A friend recommended Le Local, and it's now my turn to recommend it to you. First of all, the place is absolutely gorgeous: high ceilings from an industrial past, terrace, stunning decor of wood, glass and steel, dimmed lights and an open kitchen concept. The service is also to mention: not the greatest I had (come on, what is the cost-benefit of offering a young friendly couple a free glass of wine when you know it's their first anniversary??) but our server was (cute) friendly, discrete, and very available.   Then the food. I had the Burgundy Escargots cassolette, mild garlic gnocchi, shiitakes, braised shallots, bordelaise sauce and the (omg) Salmon tartare with truffle oil and fresh lime juice. The Tartare was the highlight of my life. I wanna go back right now.   I'll go get myself a peanut butter toast meanwhile."}
{"text":"Hubby and I came on the rec of his old college buddy. There's a very \"hip\" atmosphere with impossibly good-looking staff. The food was good - especially the beet salad appetizer. For our main entrees, husband got the steak and I got the salmon tartar. I liked how you could choose to get a large salad as a side, a large fries, or a small salad AND fries. Nice touch. The accompanying wines were also lovely. It was a great place, but at the end, the $120 bill seemed steep for the type of food they were serving."}
{"text":"Pleasant for lunch also, outdoors or in. Nice and reasonable wine selection, including private French bottlings (try the Roussillon white). Duck confit salad was excellent. Staff young but professional."}
{"text":"Great time on lunch time with co-workers, we all went for the table d'hôte and all were very satisfied. Personally I went for the steak and the presentation and taste was up to par with my expectations.  Others had the salmon plate, also nicely surprised by the presentation and taste. Prices are fair as the table d'hôte was 25 dollars; not \"cheap\" but definitely better than some of its competitors in the neighborhood.  Beautiful terrasse on William street close or in old Montreal. Recommended for work lunch and would definitely consider it for other occasions as the setup is very well placed and close to other activities."}
{"text":"On our first trip to Montreal, I found this place on Yelp and gave it a shot based on the quality reviews.  My God, the flank steak -- I'm speechless, it was sooooo delicious.  A week later and back home in California, I'm still daydreaming about the steak.  Is it reasonable to book a return trip just to have the steak again?    Okay, enough about the steak... My fiancé had the duck confit, and he's actually quite a snob when it comes to duck.  It was exquisitely prepared, and he told me it was the best he had ever had outside of France.  We were a bit nervous, because we don't speak much French, aside from 'hello,' 'thank you,' and 'do you speak English?'  The waiter, who was from France himself, was very attentive (man these guys wrote the book on service), and didn't seem to care that we could barely speak French.    Do not skip the dessert.  I'm on the paleo diet, and I watched several other patrons enjoying various masterpiece desserts.  I submitted to my desires and found my taste buds instantly transported to cloud-9.    For you Americans, this place takes American Express."}
{"text":"I live in Montreal.  This is in my top 5 restaurants here.  Great food, great atmosphere and service!  On two occasions I've had groups of up to 12 with me and the service is fantastic.  They are very good at handling small or large tables.  The patio is also very nice, great part of town."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Modern and urban decor sure to please the young profesional crowd. Beef tartare and salmon were a treat!!  The service was also excellent, very attentive yet discrete."}
{"text":"The beet salad is wonderful and a great way to start the meal.  I had the rabbit which was expertly cooked.  A rare find indeed!  It's pricey but worth it!"}
{"text":"Cool House music. Too bad I already have that in my Ipod.   Salmon tartare, although slightly lacking in salmon flavor, was a good start. Balanced and well seasoned.  My AAA grade strip loin however, was an overcooked and underseasoned mess. It was more medium well than medium rare. Why would you scorch such a nice piece of beef? And if you're going to charge an arm and a leg, season it correctly, please. Or put some salt on the table.  Come here to be hip, I guess."}
{"text":"We loved it. My husband had the salmon and I had the halibut. Everything was outstanding and service pleasant and attentive. Our waiter smelled really good as well:-)"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our evening at Le Local during our recent trip to Montreal from Toronto.   Food - 4/5 To start we had the grilled octopus salad and the bitter lettuce salad. Very simple dishes elevated to a higher standard. I even made mention to my partner that these were both dishes my mother who comes from a small village in the north of Greece who's culinary indulgence is KFC (only on toonie Tuesday) would not be nervous to try and would enjoy very much.   For our mains my partner had the cheese ravioli with duck confit. It was very rich and decadent. The cheese filling was creamy and smooth. For a non pasta eater she adored it and so did I from the samples I fought for. My main was the catch of the day. A beautifully prepared pan seared white fish on top of Chinese broccoli, shitaki mushrooms mixed veg and sprouts with light Asian broth.   Desert came as a suggestion from the waiter. The pot de cream was just enough to satisfy my sweet tooth and cap of a lovely meal.  Service - 4/5 Our waiter was very well mannered and attentive. He was very knowledgeable and gave great recommendations on wine and the food. The best part was he was there when we needed something and absent so we could enjoy our company when we didn't need him.  Our only one complaint with the service came from the server who brought us bread. He seemed to throw down the butter and bread without so much as a hello or excuse me.  Location/Atmosphere: 4/5 The restaurant is situated just outside old Montreal tourist area. It's like finding a hidden gem that only local know about. The decor is industrial contemporary. A real nice touch using the old building to its fullest and adding some modern elements. My only complaint was with our seating. The chairs look to be wicker patio furniture. It made sitting at the table awkward and hard to talk to.   Price - 4/5 By Toronto standards we found it very reasonable. Two starters, two mains, dessert, coffee and two drinks each will put you in the $150-200 range. Not unreasonable for a nice night out."}
{"text":"Very classy place. Made reservations with open table and got there right on time. The hostess was amazingly beautiful and sat us. The service was fast and friendly, and the food tasted very nice. Very expensive though, but at least they spoke decent English. I had the foie gras appetizer (entree), and the salmon tartare. I wouldn't say I was a big fan of the french delicacy of geese liver, the texture was awful, but it tasted good. It was a bit too slimy for me. The salmon was nice, but a little flavorless. Dirty martinis do not come with seedless olives, which is one of my biggest pet peeves. We ended up ordering a bottle of napa wine, and I can honestly tell you that it was marked up 500% because I've had the same wine in Napa at a fraction of the price, but we got to  overpay, so that allowed us to be snooty for the day."}
{"text":"Party of 4, on a Wednesday night, first timers, all food was very good. The carpaccio and the crab cakes were a great way to start this start this meal, the beef tartare main was also delicious.  The Petit Pot de caramel was so very good, it wasn't shared at all!  Attentive service and bilingual.  Côté Maison seemed quieter than the main dinning area, which was a good thing. One small disappointment: the washroom, Côté Maison."}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD . . . slow service (hence only four stars). We loved the atmosphere and the menu was small but complete. A pork, beef, vegetarian, seafood, poultry choice for main entrees. The beet salad was amazing--very different from anything I have ever had. We also had salmon, duck, and halibut. Everyone was happy. The dessert sampler at the end of the meal is perfect!"}
{"text":"First let me say, I really want to give this restaurant 4 stars but I just can't - the service was just too good to deserve that kind of ranking. The waiter we had was really exceptional (and being a former waiter myself, I appreciate the difference between good service and bad). He was attentive, helpful, and even went so far as to open a special bottle so I could enjoy a wine by the glass no usually available and steer me away from some not so great wine choices that probably would have upped the bill a bit. The food was very good - the appetizers were great, including what could have been a very ordinary green salad. The beet salad with poached egg was done perfectly, with just the right balance of flavor. My wife said it was the best beet salad she'd ever had. The duck was excellent, perfectly prepared, though a little rich for my taste (which is why I didn't order it). The only disappointment was the steak, which was both somewhat on the small portion side, and unremarkable. Given the stellar service and pleasant decor, I expected something more from what admittedly was described as a more typical dish. Don't get me wrong, it was good, but just not as great as everything else at this restaurant. Next time, I'll give myself over to the chef more and only order from the specials menu. Seems like that's the way to go here."}
{"text":"Pricey but very nice place - perfect for a romantic date night, beautiful covered terrace and the food is excellent. The halibut was cooked and seasoned perfectly, and there was this lovely crispy onion/noodle-like feature laid overtop that complemented the texture perfectly - I highly recommend this dish.   The bitter orange sauce on the duck, however, wasn't our favourite, but the dish overall was still delicious despite our personal dislike of that particular flavour.   The mojito was super fun and was served in an Erlenmeyer flask and it's was good, and not too sweet.   And the washrooms are very nice and super clean - clean washroom=clean kitchen."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favourite restaurant in the neighbourhood with a cozy terrace on summer and amazing interior"}
{"text":"This is clearly one of my favorite restaurants in Montreal. Ive been here twice. Once for my birthday and I took some clients for dinner. The atmosphere is lively and the food is simply amazing. Being that Ive gone twice and at diffferent times, my experiece was different, but nonetheless the food was great. If you must try a drink, please try the Tokyo Express. As an Entree I had the Flank Steak and Spicy Butter and it was cooked to perfection. On a busy night the service can be a bit slow, but with good company its worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great place, good food, exhaustive wine list and a beautiful terrace.  Food is refined enough to set itself apart, but not to a point of snobbery or pretentiousness.  Each plate had ingredients complimenting each other quite well delivering a delicious experience.   If you're looking for something away from the downtown or Old Port chaos, le Local has you covered."}
{"text":"OMG!!! What a nite!!! We had so much fun and ate such good meals, this is just simply memorable!!!  We had the escargots, the beats with fried egg, the fabulous and fantastic and extraordinaire foie gras poele as appetizer!! I had the Halibut for entree, it was just exquisite!! We met with the owner, elise la sommeliere, our server was jst simply the best, always caring, laughing, joking with us, he would hear us from 20ft away if we were mentioning something and would come back with an answer. And now I am forgetting everybody's name, we had way too much wine and cocktails that nite! We were drinking the CA wine Twelve Clones but I wasn't in such a bad shape that I couldn't taste the food. It's just that we were eating it seems like forever!! God it was good! I really can't wait to go back!! Woohoo!! As good as it gets!!!"}
{"text":"Very good farm to table food.  We were first seated in the bar.  Music was too loud for any meaningful conversation other than to shout.  They moved us to kitchen area, which was perfect.  Not 5 star as alcohol pour was tiny and expensive."}
{"text":"Gorgeous decor and friendly staff. One of the best restaurant in Montreal, but hey, that's just my opinion. Had the beet salad and also the flank steak... Both were perfect. Waiter helped to pair drinks as well as helping my girlfriend out with her order.   At night, the lights are nicely dimmed and the aura of the restaurant shines."}
{"text":"4.5 stars.  So it probably helps when you have a friend's uncle who happens to be a millionaire that is paying for the entire meal, i.e. getting to order whatever appetizer, entree, and dessert I want without worrying about the cost and having some damn nice wine, dessert wine, and digestif along with it.   That being said, the quality of food was excellent.  I got the a foie gras dish for the appetizer, a calf liver dish for the entree, and a deconstructed peach thing for dessert - none disappointed.  And though I wasn't paying for the meal, I still did look at the price of the food and it seemed fairly reasonable for what I was getting.   Service was attentive and the sommelier was knowledgeable as well."}
{"text":"This is a difficult review to write because the food was actually very good, really, exceptional given the price.  The problem was the service, which was unprofessional, sloppy, and generally disappointing:  it takes a special type of bad service to overshadow such good food, but Le Local nailed it.    First, it was *insanely* slow.  Two and a half hours to get two courses is just nuts.  I am sure there are tables that like to linger, but it is really brutal to sit there for more than an hour after finishing your appetizers waiting for a main course.  Among other things, we were hungry.  There is just no excuse to completely ignore a table for that long.  Second, and massively compounding the first problem, we had to ask repeatedly when anyone ordered a drink.  Setting aside that this was irritating, it was also strange:  Le Local easily lost out on $100+ of high margin revenue from a single four-top simply because it was difficult to order drinks and the drinks didn't come when ordered.  (And I should be clear, no one had more than two drinks during the nearly three hours between the time we walked in the door and the time we walked out.  It's not as if we were boozing it up.)  Third, the waiter was kind of a jerk.  Two guys at the table (one in particular) were your basic steak and potatoes guys.  Sure, the one guy's questions about what food was were incredibly basic, but there was no need to be patronizing to him, which our waiter was.  And there was *zero* degree of attentiveness (although, in fairness, since we had no food at our table for most of the time we were there, I'm not sure what there was to attend to).    Fourth, the waiter omitted key information.  In particular, the medium rare steak was prepared exactly the way I like my steaks, which is to say it was really what most people think of as rare (red).  The problem is that it wasn't my steak, and the guy who ordered it wanted it cooked the way you usually think of medium rare (basically pink, with a tiny bit of red in the center).  You shouldn't  serve someone a red \"medium rare\" steak without mentioning it to them first.  Bottom line:  the food is (extremely) good, but it's some of the worst service I've ever experienced.  Skip it.  *******************************  The above is offered with one quasi-caveat.  There are two tables in the dining room that are either amazing or terrible based on your group's preference, basically, they are right on top of the open kitchen, so you have to be okay with a bell getting rung in your ear periodically.  We were shown one of them:  I would have really liked the table, but everyone else in my group was uncomfortable with the set-up.  For that reason, they seated us in the lounge.  Maybe the service in the dining room would have been better.  (But if so, that still doesn't get them off the hook, with two tables that offer such an incredibly specific experience, a restaurant with any focus on the customer would have asked me if I wanted that table when they called to confirm my reservation.)"}
{"text":"Restaurant découvert pendant Montréal à Table 2014. Très belle expérience. Très bon service."}
{"text":"Delicious from start to finish!!  We searched Open Table for reservations, but there were none for our desired time, so we called Le Local and they were able to fit us in for our time.  Started off with the beet salad which was amaaazing.  I'm a fan of anything goat cheese or truffle oil, and this did not disappoint!  Great flavors!  For the main, I had one of the fish dishes (the one with bacon and risotto) to try something different and it was great as well.  Finally, shared the pot de creme (not sure of the official French title) and the pumpkin cheesecake.  Wow.  I highly recommend all of the above.  The others I was with also loved all of their dishes.  I don't think you can go wrong! I'm not familiar with Montreal, but it's in an area under development / construction and there didn't seem to be much around.  But that made the street parking easier.  The inside is very modern / industrial.  Great ambience, too. I highly recommend for anyone in the area!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! A delightful way to enjoy our first night in Montreal.  This restaurant features all local and organic food. To start we had the local beef tartare and a layered cold appetizer of layered avocado, shrimp, smoked trout, whipped cream, port jelly, and fresh tomatoes.  As if this wasn't enough, we each continued with our own entree - Ramzi had the guinea fowl and I had Atlantic Boston Cod. Our evening was very enjoyable in this restaurant of urban, cozy, and quaint ambiance with a touch of cool club music playing in the background. Check it out!"}
{"text":"My friend and I had the beet salad, salmon tartar,  veal liver and creamy caramel with sea salt for lunch. Honestly everything except the dessert was just heavy and super greasy.. especially the salmon tartar, couldn't even finish it. won't go again"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great. The food was lovely as well. I'd definitely go back. The only strange thing about our experience was the bread. However, a strange phenomena in all restaurants that I've tried in north America and Europe: the customer is presented with a basket and is asked to choose a slice! Strange (and not in a quaint way)!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a solid value for me. They change part of the menu depending of available local products. The staff is friendly and available, but I agree with some of the reviewers that the service can sometimes be disjointed; however, not major complaints here!  My all time favorite is their beef tartare. I kind of want to say that it is one the best beef tartares in all Montreal! Very refined in taste and in texture. The appetizer's portion is just perfect.  Last time I went, we had the pan-seared scallops dish and the only negative comment would be the sand in the dish.... we mentioned it to the waiter who escalated it to the chef. He came back saying that it was their first time serving the dish, that it was probably coming from the wild mushroom and thanking us for our comment. They offered us dessert to make it up for it, which was very nice of them."}
{"text":"The place is trendy and our waiter was very attentive to us. What i did not like is that he recommended us the lamb shanks and later on admitted that he never tried the menu. How can you sell a business that you dont even know how it taste like?   Needless to say, we ordered:  1. The onion soup: too salty, but the dish is guaranteed to be salty anyways.   2. Beet salad: tasteful, right combination between salty and sweet.   3. Salmon tartar: probably the best you can have on the menu.   4. The lamb shank: salty and meat does not fall off the bone.   5. Duck confit: salty   6. Creation du chef, as dessert: (complimentary) good but not convincing enough for me to come back.   The problem with adding too much salt is that you start losing appreciation of the meticulously chosen ingredients....  Sprinkling water 6$ Green tea 4$   I don't know, seems to me that ive spent a better 175$ for food elsewhere.   Service and ambiance was amazing though!"}
{"text":"Loves the place and the atmosphere, the food was really good as well. I suggest the scallops and the foie gras.  Service was outstanding, everyone was very kind!  Perfect place to go as a group or couple, very good music and sound.  Will definitely go back very soon!"}
{"text":"Pretty classy joint conveniently located near the center of Montreal.  The service here is akin to the fancy smancy restaurants in the states and dare I say that the food is pretty darn good too.    The wait staff was very helpful, the sommelier was attentive and even the woman serving the bread was on top of her game.  From a pure service standpoint this place is an easy 5 stars of gloriousness.    I got the poutine, mac & cheese as well as the steak.  - The poutine was good, but the cheese curds could have been smaller so as to not be devoured in a single bite and virtually gone after the top layer of french fries were eaten.  - The mac and cheese was pretty solid, and portions were reasonable.  - Finally the steak was overcooked, yet still maintained a reasonable consistency and flavor.    All in all a solid experience!"}
{"text":"Great spot!  Despite being seated in the front bar area which was far too loud... this was the perfect place for me to start integrating back into life in Montreal! I took a friend visiting from Toronto and we had a lovely meal... beet salad and salmon tartar to start. The beet salad was the clear winner - though be ready for the beets to be covered in cheese. For my main, I had the steak & fries. The plate was literally overflowing with food: fries, salad and a sizable piece of steak (almost like a tenderloin). It was all excellent but far too much food. My friend had the main-size version of the salmon tartar. I'd go with the appetizer if you love salmon tartar - and have something a bit more flavorful for your main.  The service was attentive and flexible in English and French.  We each had a glass of the Californian red - delicious.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time yesterday evening. Ambiance is definitely amazing there. Dimmed lights, big space and high ceiling creating Griffintown loft style through rough material and modern lines. Very cosy, at the same time, high-end.  Norwegian trout gravlax appetizer was delicious and tasty. Served with potato salad, it was a good match. I loved the black cod as a main course. It was probably one of the best I had. Paired with roasted carrots, fried cipollini, salsify and spinach, black cod was soft textured and honey-soy glazed. Orgasmic.   Service was fast and great on this wednesday eve."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I serious foodies and I had the best meal of my life here! I would seriously make the 5 hour cross country trip to Canada just for their chicken. It was AMAZING"}
{"text":"While spending an extended weekend stay in Montreal, a group if us ( eleven ) decided to have dinner here at the recommendation of our hotel concierge.  We were seated in a semi-private room which was perfect for the birthday celebration we had planned.  Our server, Harold, was great. I am sure it is tough walking into a huge group of gay guys who are intent on drinking a lot and having fun. Harold warmed up to us quickly and made our dining experience fantastic. Not only was he professional and highly efficient, he was able to handle us with a sense of humor and made us feel welcomed.   The food was delicious as well as beautifully presented. I highly recommend the warm beet salad, I love beets but have never had a salad like this  . . . amazing ! The beef entree for two, can actually feed at least three, if not four, depending upon how hungry you are.   I will always stop here when I am in Montreal!"}
{"text":"I really loved the beet salad. I had the halibut and enjoyed the flavors.  Great night with friends. Enjoyed the ambiance. Service was a little slow, but that is to be expected in Montreal."}
{"text":"woot.  amazing food...  Highly recommend the beet salad.    Montreal's pretty people go here for dinner but I was able to sneak in for some reason. The food is excellent.  Some of the best I have ever had.  Been here 3-4 times and tried bunch of different thing and each time I am surprised on how well they make it.  Great wine list too.  Who else in Montreal carries Au Bin Clemant from CA???"}
{"text":"Cozy atmosphere. Attentive and knowledgeable wait staff. Delicious food with subtle twists."}
{"text":"Let me set the scene: We had just arrived in the city, hungry, rain-soaked, and wandering down a deserted street in the middle of nowhere because Yelp told us to. Our expectations were, understandably, low.   Then a cheerful hostess seated us at her last available table. And we remembered why life is worth living.  The repurposed interior of Le Local is a perfect reflection of the restaurant as a whole. The crowd is well-dressed and sophisticated, but a sense of relaxed enjoyment puts you at ease. It's the kind of place that has a great wine list, but no one will blink an eye if you decide that what you really want is a bottle of cider to accompany your meal. (It turned out to be delightful.)  The menu, divided into \"classics\" and \"seasonal,\" was first-class deliciousness all the way. Particularly memorable were the divine ravioli with duck confit, and the flank steak. This is comforting, stick-to-your-ribs stuff, but done with terrific attention to detail. Even the plank of little mignardises at the end of the meal was thoughtfully presented (and happily consumed, even though we were, as you can imagine, full).   Our server was charming but totally professional. What a welcoming place, and what a perfect introduction to Montreal!"}
{"text":"I recently had dinner at Le Local which turned out to be a disappointing experience due to the unprofessionalism of the hostess. Despite having made a dinner reservation for a table in a quiet spot over 1 1/2 weeks prior (and confirming this kind of table the day of), she attempted to seat us at a tiny 2-top in the middle of the dining room. When we asked to sit at one of the 4 empty 2-tops by the windows, the hostess told us those had all been \"reserved for specific people\". She then offered us a table in the crowded bar which had loud thumping techno music. When we objected to that, she said that was all she could do and with a swish of her long brown hair, teetered off in her stilettos.  Undaunted, we had a word with the Manager and lo and behold, we were offered one of the window tables we had originally asked for in the quieter dining room. I don't know why the hostess gal wanted to make life so difficult and put a damper on what would have otherwise been a nice meal.   Apart from the hostess incident, the food was nicely prepared and of good quality. I really enjoyed my gazpacho with cucumber mousse, as well as the salmon tartare.  The decor was \"industrial-chic\"  and the atmosphere had a trendy vibe.  The location was in a downmarket part of town and a half block from a major highway."}
{"text":"Had a very good meal. The appetizers were both big (by french standards), but both nicely prepared - the beet salad was especially good, as was the tart with tomatoes and caramelized onions. For the mains, the pastured veal chop with buffalo mozzerella, fresh tomato and balsamic glaze was very good. The halibut was also very nice. Great room as well, although sit in the front room or outside, the back room was a little cut-off."}
{"text":"While, probably not my favourite stop in Montreal. This place has many things going for it.   First and foremost, it has a very nice wine list, including a few of my favourites from my time in California.  For this evening, a bottle of 09 Etude Pinot Noir was the weapon of choice. Second, seating, the vibe is wonderful, intimate, very cosy.  As yelp should lead one to believe, the tartar is certainly a welcome, and pleasant app. Cleansing and fresh, it was a lovely start of the evening. This paired with the bread offering I was certainly awaiting more. My companion and I both opted the chef's special. A seared Sea Bass, accompanied local veggies, friend calamari, and octopus ink. Balanced and delectable.    As for desert, an Apricot, Peach, and Cream concoction. Topped with cornflakes, drizzled with a light foam. This was certainly the best dish I had here.  The contrast in texture and balanced sweetness was welcome and delightful.  The biggest detractor that prevent this from being a solid 4 star location? The price point. The curve is a bit steep for what it is, and it lacks that \"Special Sauce\" to put it into the realm of demanding it's price tag.  However, given its proximity to my condo, I will undoubtedly revisit."}
{"text":"This was the first meal of our labor day Montreal getaway, and it was a great way to start the weekend!  I booked the reservation in the car on the way up, on a Friday night. I was a little nervous that the fact that they had so much availability was a bad sign, but we ended up having a great experience!  I really enjoyed the decor--industrial chic, with painted brick walls, shiny metals, soft textures.. really fun and modern. The service was great, and we felt welcome right away.  We ordered a Cru Beaujolais for our wine--something light we figured would go with a variety of things. It was nice, maybe a little overpriced (but you expect that in a nice restaurant). There was a really decent wine list, with quite a few options, had we been looking for something more specific. We didn't spend too much time looking at the cocktails menu, but we saw a few other patrons get drinks that looked great.  We started with the beet salad appetizer, based on other reviews. Holy moly! It was really amazing- golden beets, served warm, with a delicious creamy sauce, bacon, goat cheese.. and the panko egg on top! It was really the highlight of the night for me.  I ordered the salmon tartare, and my husband ordered the beef tartare as our main dishes. I like that there's an option to order the tartare dishes as appetizers, or to add a side to them and make them a main dish. We both chose to add salad and fries (you can add salad, or fries, or 50/50, which we did). I thought both were delicious! The salmon tartare had truffle oil which really gave it a unique flavor, and my husband liked it best. The beef tartare was the perfect amount of spicy, and it was my favorite of the two. The salad and fries were great as well.  We had a lovely creme brulee (my favorite dessert) to end the night. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Came here for a big celebration with friends and already went back. every loved their meals. starters: Carpaccio, tuna tataki, but the foie gras with the blueberry tart is seriously one of the best THINGS I've ever eaten. period. as for the entrees? Contre-filet de boeuf (is a HUGE 10oz) and get the extra foie gras. but everyone who had the famous tartares were very very happy too. This is ranked in my top five restaurants in Montreal for food, and top three for value."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, nice service. Canard comfilt is highly recommended, but dessert could be skipped."}
{"text":"Honnêtement, j'ai aimé mon expérience. Souper d'affaires sur la terrasse. Agréable, convivial. Belle qualité d'ingrédients, très belle exécution, vaste choix au menu. La liste des vins est assez pourvue, les prix sont un peu élevé à mon avis mais ça va, il y a des choix abordables. Le pain était assez ordinaire.  Seul bémol, si le service était empressé et vigilant il reste que le déroulement du repas a été assez long et les plats principaux ont été servis en deux vagues assez espacées. Goulot en cuisine?  Les prix sont justifiés.  Assez trendy et oui, la clientèle est plutôt m'as-tu-vu. Mais bon, on va pas bouder son plaisir pour si peu. J'y retournerai."}
{"text":"The two stars is for the food and not the service. Service was a solid four! We came here for our 6th year anniversary and we're really excited since reading so many rave reviews of this place. The wine list is exceptionally long! Last time I saw such a long list was at Queue de Cheval lol! But boy was the wine we chose excellent! Ok. Back to the food. Hubby chose the soup of the day that tasted better then it looked. Not a good soup but if it had the taste of its looks...ish!! I got the steak tartar as an entrée and was really disappointed! It was so so bland! No salt whatsoever. It just seemed as if the had cut the beef up into little chunks, added a bit of oil and voilà!! I had to add so much salt since there were none in the tartar. It wasn't good. For our mains, hubby got the salmon tartar with side salad and fries. The salad and fries were ok. The technique of preparing the salmon tartar was the same as the steak tartar. No salt, no flavouring. As bland as boiled white rice! I had the catch of the day. It was an artic char. The only well seasoned dish although too many components on the dish . And the bacon salt was unnecessary. We didn't dare go for desserts. Service was really good though. Too bad the food wasn't up to par with the wine and the service."}
{"text":"Le Local is awesome... my new favorite in Montreal for high end dining. The interior is bright and open, with high ceilings and natural light. The staff are on point, and the food is fantastic.  In particular, the beef tartar and duck confit were delicious   Recommended"}
{"text":"We ate here on our first evening in Montreal and really loved it!  It reminded me of a warm homey version of Los Angeles - cool decor and beautiful people with genuine smiles and a joy of life.   The olive bread and butter was WOW! good and it was tough to stop at just one slice. I loved the  gazpacho with foam (seriously the best EVER) and I treated myself to a glass of very good ROSE and the salmon tartare as my main course.   Mister told them we were celebrating our anniversary when making the reservation, so they brought us the yummiest dessert - i was so surprised!    We will definitely return when we visit Montreal again - GO!"}
{"text":"Easily one of the best meals I've had in months. I'm a little surprised how empty it was on a Saturday night - maybe all the local construction is driving people away - but don't let it stop you from visiting and having an epic meal.  Everything we had to start was delicious and nicely presented. A few other yelpers have mentioned the beet salad (with truffle oil and goat cheese, panko breaded egg, and bacon). Yes, yes, yes. You need to get it. Just opening up the egg and seeing everything mix together is beautiful, but then when you put it in your mouth, it's just magical.   The main dishes were even more impressive. The salmon and duck confit were the biggest winners at the table. Dare I say that the duck confit was the best I ever had?  Service was top notch. I love the industrial chic feel of the restaurant, and it's great to know they work with sustainable and local fisheries when possible.   Wines by the glass were a bit of a bummer. The cocktails, on the other hand, really delivered in their uniqueness and punch.  Co-ed bathrooms on the second floor. Say what?"}
