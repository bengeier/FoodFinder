{"text":"This place is amazing! After eating here the first time I came back a couple days later for more!  They have great carne asada and birria tacos. The green salsa is my favorite! Everyone there is really friendly and easygoing."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! I went for the first time a couple of weeks ago and have gone a few times since. The beef birria is really flavorful and tortillas are homemade, so good! The wait crew is friendly and I have not had any issues with ordering (absolutely no need for a translator as a previous rating has mentioned). This food is authentic and I will be back for more... A LOT more ! Try the horchata, its the real deal."}
{"text":"So my car was getting repaired across Bell Rd. last week and I needed food - I hit El Tapatio and thought I'd get pretty good eats - and it was, but skimpy on portions and high on price.   I was the only white,English-speaker guy in the place I think. The young girl taking my order had very limited 'Ingles' goin' on. The Dos Equis bottle was perfect, cold and fresh. No chips or salsa offered beforehand, and I ate in! The beef mole enchiladas I ordered had no beef and no mole, but only cheese. But since the communication was bit rough, I didn't fuss - the lettuce and beans and rice were fine, so it all went down easy. But you might want to bring a translator if you go with the family!"}
