{"text":"So good best tacos even though nothing fancy the waiters always friendly and fast Only con is that it's outside so in the winter it's cold  Also even though there's a lot of tables they are all crowded and hardly any parking"}
{"text":"Éste sábado 8 de abril pasado fui a comer a este lugar, de verdad la comida muy mala me pegó una diarrea terrible, hasta ahora no me la he podido detener, no se los recomiendo,  y si van vayan con mucha precaución!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriends family are regulars here and absolutely love the food. I had the quesadillas which were pretty good, nothing to special. They had the tacos which they love. It's a cute little food truck."}
{"text":"best tacos ever ! seriously !  I wish they were closer to the east valley , but I'm always more than willing to make 45 minute drive out there .   must try the vampiros. the salsa they put in them is amazing. I wish they opened earlier & I would be there all the time.    if you love tacos as much as I do , you must go here!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for tacos.  They are the best and their agua de cevada is the best I've had. Great customer service."}
{"text":"Tacos were Excellent!! My wife and drove from Surprise craving carne asada, lengua, and cabeza tacos. I'm a very, very picky person when it comes to tacos. These tacos hit the spot!!! Be sure you like your tacos a little spicy before asking for everything on your tacos.....little bit of a kick on their chile. It was very busy but we sat down in less than 3 minutes and our server attended us right away. I would highly recommend this taco stand; you will not be disappointed. By the way, you can bring your own drinks"}
{"text":"I don't think it gets any better than this place. I hadn't had a really good vampiro since I've had my first one in LA. The vampiros here are a must! Especially with the salsas that they have. We also ordered two tacos de pastor and the meat was cooked perfectly. They also give you a tray of veggies, have Fresca in the bottle (yes), and can buy cds and dvds (lol). I don't think you can find another places with all these awesome extras, especially the dvds."}
{"text":"First time going to a food truck and this place was crowded and even had a line. it shows just how much people are willing to wait for the food.  They give out large water bottles for free and they have tables set up and waiters and waitresses to clean the table and deliver ur food.  Its not like a restaurant at all but its a pretty dainty food truck. Their bathrooms are clean and their food is bombbbbb  I ordered 3 al pastor and 3 carne asada tacos and mm... idk what they put in there but the spices were so bomb. They also provide you with hot sauce and guac as well... if i didnt live so far away id come here all the time. And its a plus that they open till like 12am  Came here on accident just bcuz all the other restaurants were closed at 9pm and im kinda glad that happened because i discovered a favorite food truck place ^~^"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best tacos in AZ. It's 40 min drive from my place and I don't mind it . My favorite is the carni asada vampiro . It's a food truck and it's always busy. Reasonable prices and very generous with the portions . It's in a ghetto area but so worth it ."}
{"text":"I am taco lover and tacos chava is by far my favorite place to eat tacos! We've been a loyal customer for about 3 years! I order tacos al pastor but with flour tortillas and carne asada vampiros. This place is the best I tell you . You get unlimited salsa and guacamole. Never disappoints me."}
{"text":"Soy de Monterrey Nuevo Leon y me encanta la comida mexicana siempre y cuando se autentica, batalle mucho para encontrar buenos tacos pero por fin los encontramos! Super rico, aunque lamentablemente el servicio deja mucho que desear (no toman la orden bien, encargas algo y se les olvida y terminas llendote cuando ya no tienes tiempo) pero fuera de eso los tacos estan riquisimos, 100% recomendable"}
{"text":"Hello Rocky Point tacos!  That's right, I was driving by this place looking for a used car in a tougher part of town and could not pass trying out their carne asada tacos.   It was just like street tacos.  The service is normal, the atmosphere is what is expected (see picture), the food was pretty cheap.  Don't take your date here but if you are having a craving for street tacos you should stop by."}
{"text":"So bomb. No lengua-bummer! But the pastor is delicious! Veges weren't as good as last time, but the meat was great as always and so was that avocado sauce... Yum! Will definitely be back and I recommend it to ALL my Yelp friends!"}
{"text":"Sorry but Worst Horchata Ever !!! It tasted like it was burnt. There's no parking spots and there's a lot of tables but it was so full and super loud. The tacos are Not the best , they are better tacos out there for example The Frontera #1 food truck !"}
{"text":"What a lucky find. This is like the street tacos you get in Cali or TJ. Delicious! There was a DJ playing your favorite Banda & a waitress to serve you. I tried the tacos and they were delicious. I had Tripas (intestine), Al Pastor (seasoned pork), Cabeza (head), & Lengua (tongue). The most flavorful is the Pastor. There's a nice avocado salsa if you want it and they give you a veggie tray with your order. There was some people here vending desserts so I got a Cheesecake Flan. Loved it! Pair it all with a Horchata & that's all I needed. I thoroughly Enjoyed my late night snack."}
{"text":"Best Tacos hands down. And for all you taco lovers try the Carne Asada Vampiro!!!!"}
