{"text":"I really don't understand the bad reviews.  Maybe some people cannot be pleased.  Have been going there for years and the service and food has always been top notch.  Owner has always been friendly and respectful of guests.  Our go to place for a Friday night."}
{"text":"One of the worst meals I've ever had. Their menu is outrageously overpriced. I ordered the very simple, hard to screw up eggplant parm. They managed to make it one of the worst dishes I ever ate. It was just a lot of fried dough in a bland sauce. It took awhile for a server to show up and take our drink order. It took awhile for anyone to greet us as the door even though the owner and bartender were behind the bar just looking at us. I don't know why chagrin falls has so many restaurants like this; sub-par and over priced food, lazy or snobby service, and a forced cliche ambiance. There is nothing special here and I guarantee you can make a better dish in the comforts of your home for nearly 1/3 the price."}
{"text":"Real Italian's know how good Italian food is within the first bite. Try this place, had me at first bite."}
{"text":"The decor is old Italy for sure but clean and well lighted. 
The waitress was very pleasant, prompt and knew the menu well.
The portions are large."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Cucina Rustica and it is our last.  The food was just ok.  What really bothered us were the add-ons and not being advised that they came at an extra cost.  For example the waitress asked us if we wanted lemon in our water which we agreed to.  The issue was when we received the bill we were charged for the lemon which we were not informed there would be an extra cost.  There were a couple of other items that they also tried to charge extra for that the waitress presented as a zero cost option.  What made matters worse was attitude by management regarding the situation where they definitely appeared to try to get away with something.  

There are better Italian restaurants in the area with better food and owners who actually care about their customers."}
{"text":"We've been going here for years, even though it's about 40 miles away. All of the dishes we've tried were very good, and our all time favorite is the stuffed eggplant appetizer. The people are always friendly, it's always full of people who are really enjoying themselves. We're going again tonight - and with all the Italian restaurant option in the greater Cleveland area - this is one of the best."}
{"text":"Was here this week. Had their special called Lobster Frangelica. Had the same a few months ago. It was wonderful with real lobster meat.

This time it was monk fish imitation. No lobster meat. The actual owner prepared it. I think that is called \"false advertising\" and cheating the customer. Not coming back!"}
{"text":"Looking for a place where great food and good friends get together? Cucina Rustica is your place! Featuring authentic southern Italian recipes,  the menu covers the gamut of choices plus daily specials. Try the Shrimp Risotto or Chef Gino's adaption of beef stew. And for a simple joy, build your own pizza. But what makes this place great is the friendly staff and the \"regulars\" that mingle at the bar. CR is what a neighborhood restaurant is about."}
{"text":"The food is OK.  It is pretty obvious that some of these reviews are written by employees.  Overall is a bit overpriced, but the food is average."}
{"text":"Very disappointing dinner. Food  was overcooked and overpriced.  Prices are at least 25% higher than they were last year. A glass of table wine cost over nine dollars. They don't longer have a child's menu.  They are attempting to be a high scale restaurant abandoning what was a wonderful and very popular family restaurant. Based upon the few people we saw tonight they have failed. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Since we moved to the area, people had been telling us about how great Cucina Rustica is.  They were not exaggerating.  From the street, it looks like a time-worn reception hall.  Step inside, and you'd think you were in Jackson Hole - what a great, pine lodge, ski haus vibe.  And the food - amazing!  Starting with a great bread basket and finishing with a superb chocolate cake, with everything in between five stars for all six of us.  Tested were scampi, rigatoni with meatballs, and lots of fresh fish dishes.  We'll come back and urge others to do the same."}
{"text":"The best part of the meal was the free bread. Maybe its best to just go for drinks. I ordered the special \"fresh walleye\" in a \"white wine sauce\". For $21.95 I figured this should be good. Oh and its al a cart so I ordered a side of \"risotto\". I received a bowl of obviously prefrozen walleye chunks that were really fishy inside of a brown gravy. It was made with canned mushrooms. It was inedible. I would have been better off eating Uncle Ben's 90sec rice than the risotto. It had this awful color pesto. My boyfriend ordered the special with italian sausage, cheese ravioli, and chicken parmesan. Here again the pesto sauce and tomato sauce had to have been out the can.  The ravioli was cold. The chicken parmesan was ok but it was probably microwaved. The italian sausage was decent. We both enjoyed the wine. The moral of the story...only go for drinks. Service was friendly but I was a little mad she recommended the walleye that was so bad."}
{"text":"Parking is limited in the front - I had to park in the way-back.  They wouldn't substitute soup for salad.  \"They can't do that\" was the quote.  Docked one star for that.

The bread was stale.  Docked another star for that.  I ordered the Gnocchi which was fresh and delicious.  Other patrons' dishes looked very good as well.  Wine selection was adequate.

This is very much a locals joint.  I *might* come back for the food - but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"Food is consistently excellent.  Garlic rolls, rolled eggplant, fried zucchini and mozzarella sticks appetizers are delicious.  Eggplant Parmesan is the best around and Lasagna and Chicken Parmesan are addictive.  Great Marinara sauce and meatballs.  Staff is very friendly and efficient.  Bartenders make you a great and plentiful drink.  No watered down drinks here."}
{"text":"We went there last night for the first time, after living in the area for years.  It was quite charming inside.  The prices were more than reasonable.  The server was friendly and attentive.  We had a nice relaxing meal by the sunny window. Something that we don't see in Cleveland much, sun!  The food was good value for the money.  It's definitely an Italian restaurant.  Good bread...."}
{"text":"Started off bad when the Owner/Hostess was rude from the start. The place reminds you have a cheap banquet room attached to a biker bar! But things got a little better, the waiter eventually threw us (literally) the specials...and finally came over to take the order. In her defense the waitress was busy, but not the best thing for a first impression. The food was alright...nothing to impress you! I had the chicken Parmesan, and it's first bite reminded my of a Chef Boyardee sauce, which I can not make up my mind if thats a good thing or something pitiful but it got better with every bite. 
Prices were great (feed 4 adults for $85) and that's the high point of this review. 

Recap: rude hostess (owner), over busy waitress but she was kind and very pleasant by the end, horrible atmosphere (nothing rustic about it), the food was mediocre at best!"}
{"text":"One of my FAVORITE restaurants in the area.  The atmosphere is quaint and cute, and the service is always prompt and kind. It really feels like you're dining at a small family restaurant.  It can get crowded during dinner time on weekends and as a result can get quite loud, but in a sense that only adds to the lively atmosphere that's already been created by the beautiful interior. Of course the food is absolutely delicious. My favorite thing to do is just get a bunch of appetizers and share them between friends and family, and none of us end up having any room for an entree. The calamari is a MUST GET, and if they have escargot as a special that is always delicious too. The mussels are also amazing.  They also have an extensive wine selection, making it a perfect place for a family outing, girls night out, or date night!"}
{"text":"Great little Italian restaurant in Bainbridge Twp.  I always order a seafood dish, but everything on the menu is wonderful.  It's a cozy little place, with a nice looking bar and a few tables outside for summer dining."}
{"text":"We've been visiting Cucina Rustica for over 10 years on a regular basis and it is like going home.  As a first generation Italian-American, this is the real deal.  Everyone's sauce is different so you can't compare it to Mama's.  Love the seafood and fish dishes.  The filet and rib steaks are great.  The pork cops and lasagna are better than mine.  We usually order from the long special's menu. The service is fantastic. The crusty red-haired hostess is the former owner - we just try to ignore her attitude.  Recently The owner changed some things up and now most entrees come with salad.  I'd rather order al la carte, because I just can't eat that much, but some may prefer it this way I suppose.  The decor is not trendy, but comfy.  And the owner is constantly making improvements."}
{"text":"I ate at Cucina Rustica last evening with friends - 9 in total. The restaurant was crowded, and if we did not have reservations probably would have been turned away. We all felt less than welcome by the hostess - the only negative of the evening.  

The food was superb!  I was hungry, but did not order a side salad and opted for veal Parmesan with a side of spaghetti with marinara. Several at the table ordered the caprese salad - wow what a great salad. One salad was large enough to share with two or three people. It was fresh, and well prepared, and did I mention good. We all had salad. 

My veal - another wow.  Simple, fresh, flavorful and well prepared. Reminded me of several of the restaurants on Mulberry in NYC.  The marina was good and spaghetti a good side. Others at the table had veal piccata, egg plant Parmesan, lasagna and pasta. Everyone of the dishes received rave reviews. 

My bill - for two, 4 glasses of wine, and the al a cart menu - just over $50. I'm happy. 

I am not sure, and have seen the other reviews, where the other people went, but am sorry I have not come here sooner. This is one of my reasons for writing this review - don't miss out! I will come back!  Don't let the grumpy hostess or the review keep you away! (4 stars instead of 5 due to this person)"}
{"text":"Great Italian food at reasonable prices. Menu has gotten much more creative. So if you haven't been for a while, check it out. Leave room for dessert!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Monday night. My friends wife's shrimp pasta was too salty for her to finish. My margherita pizza contained no basil, had fried crust and sprinkled with shredded mozzarella. We couldn't really hear each other over the loud senior citizens at the bar and throughout the place with their wine glasses all empty. Overall not a very good take on Italian food in Ohio."}
{"text":"Very bad service.  Waitress worked behind the bar and we sat a crunched table near the bar.  Wine list was bad even though it states they have a good one.  Overpriced!  15.95 for a small piece of lasagna.  Pizza was ok not great.  Waitress told us it was a personal pan was not was the size of a regular small.  Felt rushed.  Felt like she had no patience for us.  A glass of Kendall was 11.95 way to much for glass poured.  We visited on 2/3 in the evening after a pottery class we had taken.  Would not recommend at all!"}
{"text":"My whole family loves this place.  My parents found this gem when they moved to the northern Solon area, and we have been going ever since.  The decor isn't the most modern, but the food more than makes up for anything lacking in the visual department.  They ALWAYS have tons of fresh fish and pasta specials and the garlic rolls (pizza twists) are delicious!

For several years, Gino, the authentic Italian owner (born in Italy), worked to upgrade the banquet space in the back to use for parties.  He was finishing up the makeover right around the time of our wedding (about a year ago).  My husband and I rented out one of the smaller rooms for our rehearsal dinner.  The food was delicious, family style, and reasonably priced.  I think we got out for around $35 per person for food and alcohol.  Gino and staff were very accommodating.

I always get something different, but you have to try the lobster ravioli if they have it on special!

To be fair to some of the negative comments, I haven't been back in a while as my husband and I have moved further south, so I cannot speak to the current state of the place."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to this restaurant last Saturday very busy oddly, was seated at the back bar which is very quaint I ordered chicken francaise with risotto . When my meal came the gravy had a skin on it almost like when my mom made pudding back in the 60s from sitting under the heat lamp for apparently too long when I got the chicken it was so thin and breaded will seem like you came from the freezer that I decided to try the risotto which was not even cooked all the way crunchy very disappointing . It had been a few years since we've been to this establishment and we only live 5 miles up the street now I know why it's been three years since we've been gone and sadly to say we will never be back."}
{"text":"My absolute favorites are the Peperoni Farciti for an appetizer and for dinner I love the Chicken Parmesan and also the Spezzatino Di Salsiccita! I have been coming here for over 13 years and I love it! The staff is always friendly. They are usually busy on the weekends. Oh and they also bring you a basket of assorted bread it's delish! It's exactly what you would expect on the inside from the name. It is wooden and rustic and cozy! If you're in the area you must try it!"}
{"text":"I have lived in the area for almost 18 years and this is only my 2nd or 3rd time eating here.  The food was temperature appropriate and very good. I had the gnocchi and others in my party had ravioli and chicken parm.  Everyone was happy!  Everything is alacarte so it's not as good of value as you think when you first see the menu.  The garden salads are very small and not exceptional. My table did not receive bread with our salads, though most of the tables did.  Other than that, the service was good though a poor lady behind us took a beer shower courtesy of our waitress.  Overall a pretty good but not a great experience."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited this restaurant last night, (Valentine's Day) which is typically a very very busy night for restaurants.
We were seated soon after arrival, and greeted by our server Sarah. I have to say I am a stickler for good service, and Sarah did not disappoint. She was friendly, knowledgeable, humorous, and attentive. 
We started with the calamari aglio olio. It was tender and had wonderful flavor. For me personally I would love a calamari dish that wasn't deep fried. But I wasn't sad I ate it lol. 
My husband had the eggplant Parmesan and I had cavatelli with marinara and meatballs. The meal was accompanied by delicious garlic bread 
We enjoyed everything! 
I would highly recommend this restaurant! I know my husband and I will be frequenting this establishment."}
{"text":"Good food served in an old fashioned way. A nice menu of choices and a complete meal in the pricing rather than ala carte as many restaurants do."}
{"text":"Love it here!! Everyone is friendly who works there. I love the fish dishes, especially the Virginia Spots. Pasta is very old school, but very good. Eat the bread...very delish."}
{"text":"It will definitely be a while before we return to what used to be one of our favorite local Italian restaurants. We ordered take out last night and were told it would be 20 minutes. My husband waited an additional 40 minutes, getting some of the entrees 45 minutes after the order was placed. Understand if you are busy, but at least provide an accurate wait time for your take out orders."}
{"text":"Great Italian cuisine. My girlfriend and I go quite a bit. The staff are usually very friendly. I've had one waitress that was subpar at best. Usually they are very friendly and accommodating. I'd definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is consistently good.  This place has been in business for more than 20 years and it is easy to see why.  Meals are individually prepared and are delicious.  Servers have stayed for many years.  Service is friendly and good.
Expect crowds at dinner time, as there are repeat customers, in addition to \"newbies.\"  The garlic rolls are to die for, but are only served at dinner time."}
{"text":"Service was horrible. When the salad came out it had a dead moth in it.  They offered nothing in return. My food came out as if it were under a heat lamp for an hour. I will never go back to this place again."}
{"text":"Having moved from NYC, Cleveland Italian restaurants have a lot to live up to. This place was awesome though! I am currently eating my leftovers for breakfast. I am really not understanding the negative reviews. I think midwesterns have a strange expectation of what Italian food and pizza should taste like....that it shouldnt taste like real Italian food and pizza. This is the real deal though. Everything i have ever ordered from here is fresh, all the sauces are killer and it reminds me of some of my old favorite Italian places in Brooklyn. As for the person who said it was too loud...um its an Italian restaurant with a bar! If I ever walked into an Italian place that was quiet I would walk out. Again, this is another what I consider strange expectation of what midwesterners want in a dining experience, silence. How weird and boring! I dont even drink and I dont mind noise from the bar there. And as for the reviewer who said it was expensive.....My husband and I ordered 2 appetizers, a salad, 2 main dishes a soda and a beer and it was like 50 bucks. Maybe Mcdonalds is more in that persons price range."}
{"text":"Food is phenomenal every time, make no mistake about that, however, some of their policies need to be changed. My wife and I visited a Friday night during lent and wanted something light. The server seemed bothered that we only wanted to split a pizza. Told us there was a $5 fee to split a meal. Really?? Like who eats a whole large pizza themselves?  She said we each got a salad, even though my wife said she wanted soup, she insisted.  Ends up SPLITTING one salad which ended up being these two minute servings.  She could have just given me the whole salad and my wife the soup, which she ended up getting anyway, and said was delicious. We stopped coming here a while back because everything was a la carte, but they've since revamped that policy. This is another one they need to have a hard look at as well or we won't be visiting again anytime soon."}
{"text":"The sesame salmon was overcooked and dry. The salad that the salmon was on was smaller than expected for the price. Our server was pleasant and efficient, but not dynamic. The pizza was just okay. I've been here many times and this was my worst experience."}
{"text":"As a regular I have watched the restaurant deteriorate from a food quality standpoint, as well as \"stealth inflation.\"  Originally, the entree price included a salad and pasta.  A few years ago the salad was no longer included.  Tonight I learned that the pasta was no longer included.  A fancy restaurant may be able to get away with ala carte meals, but not a \"neighborhood joint.\"
Shame!
The restaurant was crowded tonight and I can only describe the service as \"benignly neglectful.\""}
{"text":"I have since gone back after writing this post, and I still stand by the rating for the most part. My last visit there, everything tasted great! Which is a step up than what I was experiencing on my last review. 

However, I just can't let it go that they changed the menu to all be à la carte. Meals don't even come with a simple salad, it's extra. Who wants to pay $15+ for a small sized main entree, and then some more for side dishes? A little ridiculous if you ask me."}
{"text":"I have been here over a dozen times. I can confidentially say that the quality and taste of the food has been consistent through the years. I have been with many people who ordered many different items from the menu but I always gravitate to pasta with Bolognese sauce. It's the best I've had. Also noteworthy is the Virginia spots and the shrimp Risotto. The pizzas are great too. You are certain to get a great meal for a reasonable price here. Service is fast and friendly and the decor is quaint and homey."}
{"text":"Since moving to Auburn 2 years ago, CR has become our default restaurant of choice.  On the weekends, the check in process can be intimidating.  Tons of people in waiting area...many who seem to know each other and the hostess is a bit of a crab.  The restaurant has a bit of a worn feel to it, but we consider that part of the charm.  We generally visit during the week, less crowded and the staff is a bit more relaxed/friendly.  Wait staff is mostly decent.

I find the food to be very good, decent sized portions and fairly priced.  I prefer an a la carte menu.  Sometimes I want a salad or something...sometimes I don't... so the a la carte works for me.  

Have tried most menu items and for the most part the food is good to very good.  Can often be way over-salted would be my biggest complaint.  

Overall, solid neighborhood restaurant.  Kinda like going over your mother's, food is always good, but sometimes she is just a bit bitchy."}
{"text":"Cucina Rustica is a quaint restaurant and banquet hall in Bainbridge.  We stopped here on a whim, craving Italian on date night. There is very limited parking in the front of the restaurant, thus we parked in the back. Upon walking to the front entrance, we saw the back patio bar. We asked the hostess and were told abruptly to walk to the rear to seat ourselves.

 We sat at our table for a lengthy amount of time as several waitresses walked past without greeting us. Our waitress had a party of 14, who were regulars celebrating a special occasion. We were finally given menus and ordered drinks. We enjoyed a couple beers and the Reisling with the house bread as we patiently waited to order our food next. The house bread was very doughy with several Italian herbs. 

We ordered the Chicken Parmigiana and Penne Pasta Aglio and Oglio. I added chicken to the Penne Pasta Aglio and Oglio. Both entreés come with dinner salads.

 The Chicken Parmigiana comes with an additional side. He ordered Garlic Mashed Potatoes. The Chicken Parmigiana had two large breaded chicken cutlets with tomato sauce and provolone on top. 

The Penne Pasta Aglio and Oglio is penne pasta, broccoli, and sundried tomatoes  tossed in herbs and olive oil. It was very delicious. 

Definitely would try Cucina Rustica again!"}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended- what a disappointment. Our food came out in 5 minutes and everything was raw. What wasn't raw looked like a tv dinner and our waitress was snarky when we sent it back to be thoroughly cooked. The crab legs were slimy. Overpriced- just don't go!!!"}
{"text":"Went in on a weekday night with my SO and right off the bat didn't get any service for a good 10mins. The staff looked a little flustered (maybe they just had a rush or something) so I let it go. Once the ordering process was started I told out waitress of never been there before and sorry for asking so many questions. She was nice enough but failed to mention everything is a la carte. The food was nothing impressive, especially for the price and the service made it an all around lack luster experience. I wouldn't boycott the place but I also wouldn't go back unless someone I was with really wanted to."}
{"text":"Don't try to go after 8:00 on a weeknight. Even though they say they are open until 10:30, you can barely get service, you feel you are imposing on them, and they are closing down the kitchen and vacuuming. They should just be real and post that they want to close at 9:00."}
