{"text":"I really don't know what these are reviewers were talking about, I had the opposite experience.  Dinner for four around $45 took about 5-10 minutes to prepare.  The portions were huge, we took a lot home.  Everything tasted good, though the gyros were packaged, but a bit better than the pita pit.  The owner, who was very friendly said he had a spit but there wasn't enough volume to fire it up yet.  I hope they do soon, thats how you get customers to spread the word.  For the price, the food was excellent and we will definitely be back.  We decided to try it out after Pig Out BBQ in the same plaza was full, glad we did."}
{"text":"Zeus is closed. I had dined there almost 50 times and really enjoyed the food. Towards the end I did notice the difference in the quality of the food as some of the reviewers pointed out.  It was when one of the owner's son started cooking there. My friends and I would always comment on how much different the food tasted when the son cooked. Not sure on my updated rating as I would still be a regular if they were still open and fired the son. I had upgraded the rating to 4 from 3 some time ago, I guess I will put in back to 3. Sad to see them go :-("}
{"text":"My favourite thing to eat here is the Salmon!!! It's seriously the best I have had, I eat it for lunch at least twice a week. Yummy."}
{"text":"I feel like this restaurant can't decide if it's a quick eats take-out spot or a full service licensed restaurant. Food is delicious however we waited what I would consider to be an inordinate amount of time (20 mins) when there was only one person ahead of us.  Menu pricing seems to be a few dollars to high for each item as well"}
{"text":"The food is good with generous portions. Staff is very friendly. Good value for money. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I will never go there again. I ordered a pita and a side salad. The pita was $1 off for the lunch special. The total came to $14.43.  I questioned her about the the total and her reponse was \" Yes, thats right.\"  When  I asked for the receipt she only gave me my debit receipt. I asked her for the other receipt and she was hesitant to give it to me. Then she hands it over and says \" Oh, I owe you a dollar, I forgot to take it off the total\" Ya right, I'm sure that's not the first time that has happened!  I waited over 15 mins...the chicken sat on the counter while she served other customers and the other employee was diddle daddling around, he could have come and made the pita and salad. And fyi, they don't have black olives for the salad???? The side salad is very small, definitely not worth $3.95. The pita was cold and not very good at all.  Don't waste your time and money. GO ELSEWHERE!"}
{"text":"Excellent meal! Had the beef kabobs and meal. Very tasty and the service was very nice and friendly.  Pricy, but no more than other restaurants.  I would recommend."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Greek chicken salads I have ever had. Fresh veggies, juicy flavourful chicken, amazing dressing, good portion for a meal for one (large size). Found myself craving it every week.   Sad to say that I will never be returning again. Over the past 2 months the quality has been going downhill consistently. The large salad ($10.99) has now been reduced to a side salad portion (half the size). The past 4 times we have ordered we end up having to check our food before leaving or else risk returning home to find a half filled container and missing items. We have spoken with the staff and owner multiple times now, and they always give us a reason why the mistake was made, what we should say to the staff next time when ordering, and urge us that it was a rare mistake and it won't happen again.   Today it happened once again. Only half a portion of veggies, missing tzitziki, flavourless chicken. We spoke to the owner and he attempted to console us, but no customer should constantly worry about receiving the proper service. I think we will be voting for our local restaurants with our dollars somewhere else from now on. We really wanted to support Zeus but I can no longer force myself to after 2+ months of bad service."}
{"text":"not sure if this place is still in business. they were closed during their regular hours and there was one of those real estate lock boxes on the door. their website is down. their phone doesn't answer."}
{"text":"Good greek food, nothing spectacular. A little pricy but good portion sizes. Found a piece of chicken that was on the verge on being uncooked. Greek salad was my favorite thing but again there was way too much lettuce and not enough of the other veggies. Greek fries were mediocre, nothing special. Would go back if I wasn't willing to drive further for another choice of Greek restaurants"}
{"text":"I've driven by this place a few times and finally i was able to stop in.  When i got there, the place was empty.  I mean i was the only person there.  I started to wonder why.  I ordered the grilled salmon with rice and greek potatoes and a caesar.  You order up a the counter, then take a seat and they bring it to you as its prepared, so i took a seat and within a few minutes my salad arrived.  Not bad, ok but lets see what the rest looks like.  I glanced around to see a couple more people are here now, so this is good.  Once i finished my salad, the main course arrived.  Well now, that was a mountain of food.  The salmon was seared nicely, the rice had a great flavor, the lemon and stock used with the potatoes was tasty, the tatziki on the side was robust and the garlic bread was most certainly fresh.  Now i have to pay a compliment for having such a great sear on the salmon without drying it out. So good job.  I will be back for sure, and as i was leaving several others had arrived so the place was filling in nicely.  No room for desert this time, maybe next time."}
{"text":"I've been coming here fairly often recently but I've only ever ordered the chicken meal or a large chicken salad.   Staff is friendly and the food is good don't have any negatives to say. My wife and I split the chicken meal which costs 13.50 after tax so good value in my opinion.   Large salad is huge we've never ordered it and not had left overs for the next day. The only negative is they make the food fresh so it takes time to cook would highly recommend calling ahead to pick up because if you walk in your likely be annoyed at the wait time."}
{"text":"Excellent Greek food, large portions. Gyro meat was a bit dry, but everything else has been excellent. Delivery takes about 50 minutes, but that's about on par with other \"sit down\" places. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"They're gone, and I'm surprised it took this long given how the place was never busy.   Eviction notice on the door dated January 7, 2018. Seems they disappeared sometime before Christmas as I noticed the place was still dark soon after sunset.  Always figured that once Mr. Greek opened close by on Kingston Road near the Michaels and Home Depot their days were numbered."}
{"text":"The food was unimpressive.  The Greek salad didn't have any olives, it was tiny and flavourless.   The lamb was overcooked and potatoes undercooked.  The garlic bread was only toasted on one side.   The gyros was not roasted, it was preformed slices, and heated on the grill.  Reminded me of turkey bacon.    I have had a better Greek meal in a food court for half the price."}
{"text":"The wait time is a bit... But I now know to call and order ahead... But the food is DEElish!"}
{"text":"I honestly wonder how this place has lasted as long as it has.  We tried this place out for lunch (dine-in) and ordered gyro meal, greek salad and pork souvlaki.    The gyro was the worst I've ever tasted with not enough seasoning except maybe salt as I could hardly pick out any other spicing to make this dried out strips of meat remotely Greek.  The salad was fine with the dressing a little heavy on the vinegar.  The potatoes were under-cooked and I felt like I was biting into under-cooked radish as opposed to Greek style potatoes.    Only thing edible was the garlic bread and their rice and in my opinion, neither of those make a place worth a second visit.  Seriously sad experience indeed."}
{"text":"Cafeteria /  food court type of setup. You order from the counter and grab a table to eat. It did take about 10 minute for the food to be prepared but everything was made fresh.   $11.95 for the chicken souvlaki meal which comes with rice, potatoes, salad and garlic bread. Everything tasted great. A decent amount of chicken and the meal overall was filling."}
{"text":"They have a dip called hipiti dip here. It's like a hummus but kinda a little spicy and it's amazing. The customer service here was phenomenal and the employees are really friendly. I also had chicken souvlaki on a pita and it was a perfect serving size. The food was amazing and staff were friendly. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Not bad but not exactly good either.  Nothing special about any of the dishes we ordered. Don't think we would return"}
{"text":"The staff member wasn't really paying attention, and I had to ask for things (glass of water, takeout container, etc) several times before she gave them to me. The food was expensive especially for the Pickering area. I ordered a chicken gyros and greek fries. The chicken gyros was decent; the greek fries were decent as well but a bit too oily. After my meal, which I shared with other people, I got sick. So, I won't go again."}
{"text":"Second time we had food from here...first time we ate in the restaurant in the Summer (2016).  Having just moved to Pickering from Scarborough, we thought we would try the local Greek joint.  Food was ok, rice was decent with the red sauce on it.  Souvlaki was not better or worse than say Mr. Greek (Kennedy Common).  It satisfies our craving. After a weekend out of town, we decided to look through the menu (received in mail w/in the past 6mths, as we've only moved here late in the Summer) and order for delivery since the menu stated \"FREE delivery with minimum $25 (before tax) purchase\".  So, we called in, ordered a Gyro meal, Gyro in pita and a large village salad w/ pork souvlaki, was told the total was $38.52.  After hanging up, we thought the total was a touch pricey, even if there was a price change so we called back to request for a breakdown.  As we thought, each of the three items have gone up in price by $1/each (no biggie), but was told about the $4.50 delivery charge.  When I questioned about it stating we had a menu which mentioned the FREE delivery, was told they \"had always charged a delivery charge\"...no offer to adjust that charge or compensate with anything etc.  We accepted the delivery charge...first disappointment... Once we received our order (within the promised 30min), we discovered that they use the \"machine-made\" gyro strips...second disappointment...we think it's time to venture further out into Pickering to the \"other\" Greek restaurant on Kingston Rd (closer to the mall). We were generous with our three star rating taking into consideration both of our encounters. Don't think we will be ordering from there again..."}
{"text":"Don't listen to these annoyed whiners rating this place 1 star. It's fast food, not a restaurant so stop having michelin star expectations. This place is amazing for what it is! Every time i order my chicken gyro it tastes great and is full of so much meat, I have to use a fork at the end to eat the remainders that fell out.  Glad to call this my local greek spot in Pickering!"}
{"text":"Went to his place cause it's new and wanted to try it out. There was a few ppl in there before me. I ordered my meal he said 15 mins. I ended up waiting  40 minutes for a half ass meal. Do not go here. If I could give no stars I would"}
