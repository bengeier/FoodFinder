{"text":"Correct.  L'endroit est très propre.  J'ai pris un pad sew au boeuf c'était pas mal mais un peu fade. Il faudrait que j'essaie autre chose pour me faire une idée. Service assez rapide,  plats peu dispendieux."}
{"text":"Bland Food across the board.

Recently ordered in from here. Every dish was extremely bland -- even the side sauces they provided.

Dumplings were possibly the worst I've ever had. Spring rolls tastes as though they'd been freezer burnt a while before cooking. And the Udon was noodles were soggy and void of flavour.

With so many other Asian places nearby, I wouldn't recommend trying this one."}
{"text":"Chic place on the plateau ! Cashier was really sweet and helpful, they are friendly and clean. They just open and I do recommend giving them a try, their Vietnamese sandwich is a must ! They serve tasteful and fresh meal. I love them and will be back ! Worth your time and money even though they have really good prices . -OR"}
{"text":"Damn. Short story even shorter: Pad Thai is great, brochettes are aight, and Imperial Rolls are fine.

Doo it."}
{"text":"So happy to be the first to review this new Thai restaurant next to my place!
They have just opened up so everything is 30% off.  I came to get take-out for dinner, and was impressed with their kind attitude, and fast preparation. The cashier was enthusiastic to recommend what he thought would be good to order, and I was happy to follow his advice. You can tell they just opened, and that the staff is still in a learning process, but nonetheless, my order of tofu pad-thai, beef pad saw, and spring rolls was ready in just a few minutes. Portions were generous, it was hot, tasty and overall - well done. Oh, it was dirt cheap too: about $17 for an appetiser and 2 mains that we couldn't finish - so we also have lunch for tomorrow!
I'll come back one day  to try the Banh Mi sandwich."}
{"text":"The pad thai was so tasty and the serving was generous I had to do a takeout. Yummy food!"}
