{"text":"I went there for dinner with a groupon for a meal for 2, consisting of an app, entree, and dessert from a special set menu. I do appreciate that they were prepared for groupon users, and did not make me feel awkward or like I was ripping them off by using a coupon (like many other places tend to do).

Unfortunately, the dining experience was not that great. 

The decor feels very dingy. It's not so much the antique/grandma-ish style that is the issue, but the fact that everything looks worn, chipped, and like it's falling apart. The linens on the tables look faded and ill shapen from having been used a million times. Speaking of linens, they are not changed between customers, which grosses me out a bit. 

The entryway is very tight and there are curtains hung all around. While we were waiting to speak to the hostess, someone opened the door from the outside and banged it into my friend who almost went flying.

We were seated at a table right next to the entrance, even though there were other tables available further in the restaurant. As a result, we were on display for everybody who came into the restaurant, and it was very cold due to being so close to the front door. Also the table was partially in the aisle, and the servers kept bumping into my friend's chair.

The service was SLOW. We arrived at 7:23, and did not receive our apps (ordinary house salads) til 8 pm. We were not drinking any alcohol, so there was no reason for them to delay it for so long. The restaurant was about half full at that point. I think the waiter was just busy flirting with a table of 3 women, who also happened to get their apps first, even though they arrived 20 min after us.

The entrees were fairly tasty, albeit portion sizes were small. I had the salmon with wasabi aioli and my friend had the stuffed chicken, both served over rice and roasted vegetables. The waiter never came back to ask how our entrees were. For dessert we both had the creme brulee, which was fairly standard.  We were both fairly hungry after finishing our meals, though.

The groupon touted that the value of the food was $92. No way. It was worth what we paid for it, around $30. 

I can't see myself going back... it appears like they are trying to be a fine dining establishment based on their prices, but are nowhere close. The staff is poorly trained and the food is okay, but there is nothing creative or outstanding about it."}
{"text":"I don't understand why this restaurant gets generally good reviews.  I found the decor fusty and tired (although it helps if you go towards the back where the bright light of day can't penetrate.  I've forgotten the exact wording outside, but it definitely lead me to expect a modestly priced bistro.  For two main pasta courses, one shared dessert and two glasses of wine I don't expect to pay over $100.  The service was pleasant but pretty rough around the edges.  The pasta dish was the dish of the day and it was tasty but reminded me of something I would make at home with a package of Olivieri ravioli - not particularly visually or texturally appealing.   So, I would say they should replace their table linen (at least at the front tables where it can be seen in bright light), give the wait staff a bit more training, and lower their prices by about 30%"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to go to this place... and I've unfortunately been disappointed. The food has been all right, but nothing outstanding.
The salads (small plate) were really ordinary. 
The lobster raviolis, along with the sauce were good. The salmon was ok, no real flavor.
For dessert, we had a coffee cheesecake, very heavy; and a tiramisu which was just a sponge cake with whipped cream, a kind of mascarpone and the presentation in the plate was horrible.
The service was not great and very long. The diner took 2  1/2 hours for just a 3-course meal.
I liked the feel inside. We were seated upstairs, the interior and the historic details are nice and make the place interesting to see.
I found this place very mediocre overall. For the price, I definitely would go somewhere else. There are much better restaurants in Calgary...."}
{"text":"Went for a late brunch on Sunday (around noon). It was still decently busy, had to wait a few minutes for a table but nothing unreasonable. There are some very nice paintings framed throughout the bistro, every item from the chairs to the paintings can be purchased (prices at the end of the menu). 

Their menu has all the standard brunch options (eggs Benedict, steak & eggs, french toast, etc). The waitress recommended the seafood eggs Benedict as a consistent favourite. My brunch partner ordered the cinnamon raisin french toast. Both dishes were absolutely amazing. 

The seafood eggs Benedict had a good sized amount of scallops (small) and shrimp. Each bite was equally fresh and well prepared. The dish came with two eggs Benedict, pan fried hash and a small fruit salad for around $13. About average for brunch and the meal was exceptionally hearty and delicious. The amount of Bearnaise sauce was just right, not too much to drown the dish and not too little to make it dry. 

The french toast was perfectly cooked. It was crunchy on the outside, smooth on the inside and cooked all the way through so it wasn't mushy in the middle. The cinnamon and raisin added flavor cut through the richness of the egg to make it a more interesting dish. Also came with hash and a fruit salad. 

Overall, great location, decor, service and AMAZING food. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"My wife an went on a Thursday night, and were seated in a lovely table in the front window area.  The service was exactly right.  The food was yummy and cooked to our direction.  We had a Groupon coupon which was the added bonus.

Very pleasant night out."}
{"text":"This is an interesting place.  The first time I came here, I had to sit upstairs.  It was close to the ceiling and I felt uncomfortable.  The second time around, I sat downstairs and it felt much better.  I felt calm and somehow, food taste better.  
I had the seafood pasta.  It was friggin' fantastic.  If you read my other reviews, you'll know that I hate salt licks with food around it.  This was the perfect amount of flavour and the portion size was just right.  The lamb wasn't so great though so maybe I lucked out on the pasta.  
It was a little expensive but it's worth trying once or twice.  Would I come back here?  Probably not...it's a \"been there, done that\" sort of restaurant."}
{"text":"I went for brunch this past Sunday.  Went in with high hopes for a great meal, and boy, it delivered.

It wasn't really busy when we were there (noon).  
The decor is very warming, it reminds me a lot of a olden day coffee shop, there's a piano at the window and BIG antique chairs.  However, when we stepped into the place, we seemed a little under age...
This place seems super mature...

The menu had quite a number of selections, we finally ended up choosing the Bacon, Steak (medium rare) and Egg and the Smoked Salmon Benedict.

When the Bacon, Steak and Egg came, the steak seem rather under-cooked on the top, rare....  But we decided to just stick with it.  It was AMAZING.  Even though the steak seemed lightly seasoned, it was filled with flavors and it was so tender.  I never eat rare steaks because it's so chewy, you can barely chew through it.  But this one was different, you can chew it with ease.  The bacon was rather salty and a little on the soggy side for my liking.  I DEFINITELY recommend this dish to everyone that headed over for brunch.

Next was the Smoked Salmon Benedict.  It was nothing out of the ordinary, not the first place I would think of for a Smoked Salmon Benedict.  There was just a very thin slice of smoked salmon, the egg was under pouched for a medium pouched egg.  There wasn't enough sauce on the top of the benedict.  I wouldn't be ordering this again for my next visit.

However, there was another dish I was debating over.  It is the spicy tenderloin wrap from the lunch section of the menu.  
If someone else tried this, lemme know!!

Value: 3.5/5
Food: 4/5 
Service: 3.5/5
Atmosphere: 3/5
Overall: 4/5"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of local businesses and I would definitely classify Jacqueline Suzanne's as one of those.  I've been a customer for a few years now and was initially impressed with the place when I was first introduced but over the years have come to the conclusion that it is a charming place but is overpriced.  

Our latest experience with the bistro was for brunch.  I purchased a Groupon and decided to give it another try after opting not to go here for a while now.  There were three of us at brunch.  When we initially got there at 10:30 am, it was fairly quiet but by 11am the restaurant was starting to fill up.  Our server was initially pleasant but not very welcoming.  No smile, and had a 'I don't know what is going on here' vibe.  Service warmed up by the end of our meal but the two servers in the establishment did not seem enthused about being there.

One of us had the set brunch which was $25 for a 3 course.  You get a choice of starter, main (4-5 choices) and desert (6-8 choices).  Overall he enjoyed his brunch but thought it was overpriced.  I had a prime rib steak and eggs which was quite delicious, cooked to the right doneness and a fairly large piece of meat.  The steak entree comes with toast and potatoes or salad.  I mistakenly asked if I could switch my toast (I meant potatoes) for salad and the server said no and told me the salad would be extra without suggesting that I could switch my potatoes for a salad instead which irked me slightly.  Among the three entrees that was served at our table, I think the french toast dish was the best and would go back just for that.  

Overall, the food was good, service was okay but for the price you pay, I would go somewhere else which is disappointing to me as I like supporting the local businesses but can't say that I will be returning here anytime soon."}
{"text":"I've been going to Jacqueline Suzanne's for years. I admit to being addicted to the \"Chicken Elegante\" on the lunch menu, which is a chicken, rice and broccoli dish served with a side salad. Very very good. 
They are also well know for their house made pastas which are also excellent. 

I was very excited a when they started serving brunch. It's mostly just a large selection of different kinds of Eggs Benedict, but still very good. And in Calgary it's always good to have some solid brunch options.

Jacqueline Suzanne's is certainly an eclectic little spot, lots of antiques and mish mash of style. It reminds me of my grandmother's house. For years they had a mannequin (wearing a top hat) in the window playing a piano. I was sad to see them take him away. 

Make sure you check this spot out. The food is good, the wine prices reasonable, the staff are nice. Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere. Very unique.Great Food. My wife enjoyed the fact that the last page of the menu included a price list for jewelery."}
{"text":"ALWAYS GOOD FOOD!!!

I have got to tell you that this place has a special spot in my heart and I don't know why.  For me the experience can be GREAT or SO-SO.  It all depends who is working that particular night.  The food has been pretty good, sometimes outstanding!!!  They seem to go through a lot of servers there.  I have NEVER had the same server twice.  At one point I went there three consecutive nights and neither of the nights were all that busy and there were fresh staff each night.  I don't think this is good.  You can get a great server one night and garbage the next.  When you go to a restaurant as often as I did it would be nice for the server that knows what you drink or what you ate the night before.  Anyway, we have only been there once aince the reno...we might go tonight...we'll see.  

Always good food here!!!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful little bistro in the newly upscale Inglewood off downtown, Jacqueline Suzanne's is a rare gem in Calgary's ever changing restaurant scene.

Painted tin ceiling, crown molding, and a wealth of antiques to entertain the eye, this is a foodie destination that should be high on the list to visit.  I've been here more than a few times over the years, and went again for NYE dinner.

On offer was a 3 course meal for $55, 4 courses for $65, and 5 courses with champagne for $75.  My date and I went for the luxurious and decadent 5 courses. What an experience!

On the set menu, you could start with either a seafood chowder or a spicy pumpkin bisque. I went with the bisque, and nearly blissed out. I have to admit I'd had some trepidation about it, but I was beyond surprised. The first bite had me closing my eyes and savouring. It was a real effort to keep enjoying it slowly!

Next up was a simple Caesar salad, which they nailed. Crisp, flavourful, and a perfect touch with the dressing.

The third course was a literal surprise. On the set menu it was described teasingly as a selection of their favourite appetizers.  Mystery course for the win - smoked salmon with the perfect amount of lightly flavoured cream cheese on a crostini, 2 small shrimp with a warm salsa, and a simple yet delicious pate. Mouthwatering!

For the main course, I had the lobster ravioli in a light white wine and cream garlic sauce. There was a surprising lemon zing to it, and a perfect smattering of fresh dill.  Every bite was a small detonation of flavour and only the previous 3 courses slowed me down enough to really enjoy each bite.  I've found lobster ravioli is a dish many restaurants struggle to get right, and Jacqueline Suzanne's absolutely set the standard.  

Dessert was a decadent tiramisu, one of my favourite desserts. Again, they completely nailed it.  

Jacqueline Suzanne's is a great little bistro that retains it's spot on my short list of restaurants to revisit again and again. The staff are attentive, and really understand customer service. I never felt hovered over, and even on a night as busy as NYE didn't have to once try to flag our waitress. 

Perfect!"}
{"text":"I have been here many times in the past, with the new name attached to it...it seems as if food quality and service has gone down hill.  We dined last night, I had the fish which was absolute mush, the Cesar salad which I would sometimes have for dessert it was so good, I didn't finish, and the creme brûlée was like pudding.  The service was terrible, the poor gal had obviously had no training.. We got our salads before our drinks.. The place is screaming we don't care anymore.  Very sad because the ambience is so great!!"}
{"text":"Your kidding me, $45 for Red Bicyclette Syrah, it's $7.99 online, $11.99 in the stores. It is insulting when restaurants do this to their clients. Double, acceptable, three x is rude, four times ............ 

(and no, I didn't order this little French fruit juice, just an example that stuck out about the philosophy of the place).

Food, fair but severely overpriced for the quality. Many far better options at that dollar."}
{"text":"A groupon for brunch or dinner at Jacqueline Suzanne's came up and I jumped on the chance to try a new place for brunch. The resto looks small from the entrance but coming inside, it's quite long and has an upstairs in the back . I agree with the old school atmosphere that Wendy P. described, she pretty much hit the nail on the head. 

It was clear that JS has been through the groupon type procedure before, they had a set menu for folks who were coming in with coupon in hand (and believe me, there were tons! most of the people around us were using a coupon as well). The set menu was a boozy breakfast drink/soup/fruit, a breakfast entree, followed by dessert. 

We both chose sparkling wine and juice to start, I had the bistro breakfast (scrambled eggs, toast and hash browns) and my friend had back bacon eggs benny with hashbrowns. The bistro breakfast was alright, I was dissapointed that I could not have easy over eggs - but I appreciate that they set things up a certain way so they could keep up with the anticipated onslaught of orders. The eggs were also herbed with something, which I am not really used to and am not sure if I liked. I had wheat toast, which wasn't quite toasted enough. The saving grace for the toast was the amazing jam that they have - wow I could have just eaten the jam I think!  I also have to admit that I suffered from benny-envy after tasting JS's in house made hollandaise sauce...and I claim to not even like eggs benny - I've only ever had them once, but I think JS might have changed me! 

For dessert I had a baked apple crisp thing with ice cream on top and my friend had a mocha cheesecake. Both desserts were great but really, we were too full to get the full enjoyment out of them. Rich desserts with brunch just really aren't my thing, but it was fun to change it up!

I think JS would be a great place to brunch with my mom or to bring my grandparents. I would also like to come back and try dinner at JS, I think it would an adorable, cozy place to come on a cold winter evening.  All in All - what a lovely sunny Sunday morning spent brunching with good comapny in Inglewood."}
{"text":"Like others who have reviewed J&S's previous to this one, I too used a Groupon to check out this quaint Bistro. My Groupon was about to expire in a little under a week, and you weren't allowed to use it on Friday or Saturday. My Groupon was going to expire the upcoming Wednesday think, so there was only a few day's where I could actually use it. I called to make my reservation for Sunday, and the girl who took the reservation asked if I had a Groupon. I said that I did, and she actually took a reservation for the upcoming Saturday to accomadate the overload of last minute Groupon users.
When my wife and I arrived, we were greeted and seated promptly right next to two other couples also using Groupons. (Tightly squeezed together IMO). I thought this was rather unusual since we had early reservations, 5:30 P.M. and there were no other patrons in the restaurant.
Oh, and yes they have a set menu (3 courses), which consists of a salad, main, and a dessert. (The standard).  I had a ceasar salad to start (small plate). The prime rib, as my main entree (which was dry, and had a huge piece of grissle on one edge. and ended with creme brulee for dessert. That wasn't bad.
I won't even get into what my wife ordered. 
My final thought's on Jaqueline & Suzanne's is that if you're going to put out a Groupon, than you have to put your best foot forward. I get that were getting the meal at a discount, but in my wife's case she was trying out this place to see if she to take clients here in the future.
Also getting to the Groupon, it had a photo of Rack of Lamb as a \"Tag\" to entice purchasers. This wasn't even an option as one of the entree's.
I do have to say that our server was very nice, and the restaurant itself is very quaint.

-Will I be back ? maybe
-Did I feel Like I was using a Groupon ? Yes, maybe because they sat other Groupon users all together in one area !"}
{"text":"A friend was referred to this restaurant by a woman he works with and decided to take me there for my birthday.  I checked out the comments on-line and was encouraged by all the accolades.  The menu looked enticing, so I was really looking forward to dinner on Sat. Apr. 23rd.
I had decided that I would have the crab cakes for openers.  I  was very disappointed with the quality.  I believe the crab was canned which was an immediate turn-off.  The seasoning was too spicy, along with the Aioli Sauce, which totally over-powered whatever flavour of crab there might have been.  (Note:  I've had crab cakes all over the world and these were definitely THE WORST.)
I ordered a medium-rare Filet Neptune with \"oven-roasted\" veggies.  What a disappointment!!!  The filet was too rare, tough and laced with grizzle & the veggies were either over-done or almost raw.  ONE RAW piece of asparagus was a joke!!!!  There were small pieces of cartilage in the lobster, which was a total turn-off.  I ate some of the vegetables and left most of the filet and \"the neptune\".
I won't even go into how surly our waitress was until she came to take my plate away and asked if I wanted it wrapped to go.  I said \"no thanks\" and she \"knew\" I wasn't happy (by the tone of my voice).  She then became overly cordial with my friend, who she'd been very dismissive of all through the meal.  Needless to say, it was tip time.
I will give this restaurant another chance, but will never order the crab cakes or filet again."}
{"text":"This evening a group of us went to Jacqueline and Suzannes for dinner.  I found their food somewhat expensive but I enjoyed my dinner. Unfortunately, the service was severely lacking.  Our server was not very organized and basically ignored us.  One of our friends ordered soup and salad as their main course.  The salad was brought out as an appetizer, it was only after everyone finished with their dinner that she was asked whether she was \"ready for the soup\".  What's worse is that the gratuity was automatically added into our cheque (there were 8 of us).   When our dinner companion discussed this with the server she was told that \"nothing could be done\" and that the manager wasn't in.  After some more inquiry a bartendar came over and would up taking the tip off their cheque and gave our dinner companion some kind of certificate after which we heard the server and bartender \"muttering\". While I was helping to explain the situation the bartender said something very rude to me.  
Bottom line, if a restaurant is going to include a generous gratuity then it should be warranted by exemplory service.  Placing a plate of food in front of me does not qualify, a trained monkey could do that,  What I've found is  when gratuities are included service declines. 
Where I'm from (New York), a better restaurant knows how to treat their guests and the unprofessional behaviour we witnessed this evening would not occur.  
We will not be returning."}
{"text":"I had tried the restaurant for the first time on Saturday with my boyfriend. We had a voucher to the establishment from one of those deal type websites ($50 worth of food/beverage). It was my first time to this restaurant and I was quite pleasantly surprised. The majority of the places I have gone with restaurant vouchers we had received negative service due to the voucher and servers were less than happy to deal with us. I wish I remember the server's name from Saturday (October 13th at about 7pm) as she was truly amazing. She was great with the menu in terms of knowledge and was just overall such a happy, positive person; I think she made the experience. The food was also truly amazing. We had the lambtini, pasta special (ricotta/lemon ravioli), seafood pasta and the cheese cake for dessert. We also had after dinner cocktails (amaretto coffee and a blueberry tea), and wine with dinner. I'm quite a critical person but I could literally not pin point anything that was not perfect in my minds eye. It has been a very very long time that I have gone to a restaurant where everything was absolutely perfect. I just wanted to say kudos on such an amazing establishment and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"You might not notice Jacqueline Suzanne's if you weren't looking for it, but the charming yellow cursive writing on the window catches your eye once you are close. Nestled in between the countless antique shops, galleries and knick-knack stores lining 9th avenue SE, Jacqueline Suzanne's Bistro is a must-visit for brunch if you're in the Inglewood area. 

Doubling as an antique shop, the decor of the bistro gives off an Old New York vibe. Upon entrance, a dark, heavy curtain separates the entry from the dining room. My boyfriend and I were greeted by a server almost immediately, and we were seating at a two-seat table against the wall. Our table was made complete with an almost art nouveau style lamp, which acted as a great conversation piece. The walls have an eclectic collection of art on them. The place is comfortable and interesting at the same time. The particular menu I got also had a list of some of the vintage and antique jewelry they had for sale, which was fun to read through while we waited.

Both times I've been to JS I've ordered the Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict. It's kind of my go-to for brunch a lot of the time. They do not disappoint. The eggs were perfectly cooked, nice runny yolk that melts into creamy hollandaise sauce. Coffee was served to me in a glass mug and was fresh brewed. The fruit salad served with my eggs benedict was a really refreshing and interesting mix of fruit. Not the usual grapes, strawberries and squishy melon. JS uses mango, dragon fruit and other delicious and out of the ordinary fruit in their fruit salad mix, and you can taste that they make it fresh that morning.  

If you haven't tried Jacqueline Suzanne's for brunch yet, it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Have seen this restaurant a couple of times when in the area and when I saw a Groupon thought it was a great excuse to give it a try. 

They seem to gave some great deals on - Tuesday night 2-can-dine for $69 and they also have a Sunday Prime Rib 3-course dinner for $39. Neither was an option with the Groupon if I remember right.

Went for an early dinner at 5pm on Sunday and by the time we left at 7pm they were full and seating people in their upstairs section. Not sure if this is normal so would recommend a reservation.

Started with the lambtini (we ate it before thinking of taking a picture) which was 4 chops presented in a martini glass with delicious chutney and some rocket leaves. Really enjoyed this to start us off.

I tried the chicken of the day dish - Chicken breast stuffed with crab + cream cheese with hollandaise sauce over it. Came with fresh grilled vegetables and rice. Swapped the rice for roast potatoes with no extra charge. Loved the fresh grilled veg and the fact there were a couple of options in there not just peppers, good mini roast potatoes. Sauce was tasty. Everything on the dish was quite good except, as I heard one other table mention - the real imitation crab. It tasted like real imitation crab too. On the menu I did notice Pollock Crab but figured I would give the dish a try. A couple of bites in you didn't notice the imitation flavour but would love for it to have been real crab or just no crab at all.

The Boy has the tenderloin steak with blue cheese and escargots. More of a blue cheese cream sauce so not overpowering. That tenderloin steak was fantastic thought! Perfectly cooked with great seasoning on the meat. Absolutely would recommend his dish as the winner.

We went for dessert - they had 7 options that day instead of their regular 2-3 options. Had the mixed berry bread pudding. Just so so but the vanilla ice-cream was delicious! Might have been they were just trying a bunch of options out if they had so many on offer. Might do better dessert normally but no other option to gauge against.

Neither one of us is a big prime rib fan but saw a lot of them coming from the kitchen so guessing they are pretty good. I can tell you the portions looked huge! Pile of roast beef, veg, roast potatoes and yorksire pudding. Comes in 2 different sizes. 

Will I go back? If someone really wanted to go. Meal was pretty tasty all around but not blown away for the price tag - even with the groupon it was more than I was looking to spend."}
{"text":"I was here for NYE 2012 and it was easily one of the best meals I'd had at a restaurant in a while.  We decided to make a return trip for NYE 2013.
They had a set menu - $65/pp, choose from a few selections.
We were seated promptly - the same table as the year before.. That's about all that was the same from the previous year.
Our waitress took our drink order. The previous year, a glass of champagne was included with the meal. This year it was not so I decided to order a glass of prosecco. Turns out they didn't have prosecco by the glass, only by the full bottle.  Since I was the only one drinking, I wasn't about to order a whole bottle to myself.  My boyfriend wanted sparkling water. Our waitress asked which kind he wanted - San Pellegrino or Perrier.. except she couldn't pronounce Perrier and said \"there's another one, but I can't pronounce the name\" OK..
Bf said it didn't matter. She then came back to say they were all out.  So I have a chocolate martini and the BF has a glass of water.
We order our meals, I get what I think is a basic starter salad, soup (seafood chowder) and prime rib.
Salads come. It's not what I expected at all. Kind of wilted, strange tasting.  Next is the soup, which comes before we've even finished our salads.  I had the same soup last year, and this years version is very underwhelming.
I had been watching the table behind my BF, they had the prime rib and had sent theirs back to the kitchen 3 separate times due to it being under cooked.  Unfortunately, this was foreshadowing for my meal. I had ordered medium, what I got was more rare-medium rare.  I didn't send mine back, however, as I don't mind how it was cooked.  
The one thing overshadowing everything from the night was the temperature in the restaurant. It was HOT in there.  I had to leave the table and step outside at one point to cool off. It totally affected my appetite as well. No one wants to eat when they're hot and sweaty.
Dessert was Tiramisu (they had more dessert choices than entrees..) It was also rather underwhelming.

All in all, a very disappointing evening. Last year we didn't want to leave, this year we couldn't wait to get out of there.
I can't see myself going back there anytime soon."}
{"text":"We went for brunch, had the breakfast combo and everything was splendid. The waitress Jodey was so pleasant and welcoming, made excellent suggestions. I got the breakfast martini (so delicious!!) And the salmon eggs benny and added spinach. My eggs were cooked perfectly.  Got creme brulee for dessert and it was heavenly. Got to try some of the boyfriends cheesecake and yes, it was heavy, but it's cheesecake, it's supposed to be! The wonderful service, ambiance and delicious food really made it a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"My boos took us here on or team building day, as it's one of her fave restaurants. I love the house conversion thing, but pretty cramped in there. And the washrooms are super tiny, both width and height. I had to duck to get in them. 

There wasn't a ton of gluten free options, the one was the Jambalaya, but there were out of sausage...which in my opinion is one of the main ingredients in jambalaya, so that was disappointed. It was ok, little bland though, as it was missing that extra kick. 

They were advertising their diamond fizz drink, s went with that. It was gin, champagne, lemon and sugar. Which was very satisfying. I plan to make some at home."}
{"text":"This place is not what it used to be. The prices have remained just as high, they renovated (losing the charm - no more antiques!) and the food quality has sharply declined. 

Last March I went here for Open Table's \"Big Taste Calgary\"
It consisted of a 3 course meal for $35. Not bad right?
Well...

For a starter I chose the Jacqueline Supreme Salad - I've eaten this in the past at least 6 times but this time it was awful. Normally it's loaded full of blue cheese, bacon, pecans, with mixed greens. This time it was 1/3 the size, almost no cheese, bacon or pecans and the greens were wilted. 

On to the main ah..... what's the point in finishing this. It is no longer great. That's all you need to know."}
{"text":"I went here on January 15 while visiting Calgary. I was impressed by the food as well as the service. I had crepes as well as a salad. then the pecan cheesecake. oh, so good!! it's located in one of the nicest areas in Calgary: Ingelwood, so I ended up walking around the area after supper. I will be coming back again when I'm back in Calgary in the summer."}
{"text":"Very nice romantic place with great service. It is a little pricey but well worth it if you want a romantic night out in a cozy location."}
{"text":"EDIT   Dropping from 5 to 4 Stars based on last experience. 

My last experience here was not up to my standard I've grown to expect here. 

I had a prix fix:   salad, cheese crepes and chocolate cheese cake. 

Salad is boring - not much more than a basic spring mix (yawn)
Crepes -  roast veggies in crapes with a cheese sauce.   Sauce has the flavour of whipped cream - it was HARDLY cheesy.   It was basically warm salad to follow cold salad.   Cheese cake brightened my spirits however!

All the staff here is new to me this round and it showed.   We kept getting forgotten and waited a long time for attention (the places was not packed or anything on a Monday night...)  

I'm certainly glad that wasn't my first time there... but it definitely tarnishes impression of the place.

Old review:


We had a dinner here for our anniversary.   

The whole restaurant is decorated with exquisite antiques that you can purchase if you are so inclined at the end of your meal.  The ambiance is incredibly romantic - perfect for our celebration dinner.  

We were seated in the window at an interesting display case behind a sheer curtain so we both could look out at the street and people watch and also have some privacy.  The street has a lot of charm at night and it makes it an interesting experience. 

The service is amazing - the wait staff is very knowledgable, attentive and picked up on it being a special evening which was appreciated.  They embody a lot of what hospitality in this city has lost in the last few years. 

The food is to die for!  We had a prix fix menu which is at a special price on Tuesday for some kind of date night promotion.  I think it was 2 can dine for $69.99 and our bill came to about $100 with our wine and it was well worth that price.   We got a starter (Salad for me,  a curried soup for my beau),  An Entree- I'm a vegetarian and they always have a veggie prix fix option  with is NOT always the case when I want a nice meal out.   This night I had butter nut squash ravioli  while my guy had some kind of fish that he was delighted with and he's from the east coast,  for the desserts we had apple crumble and chocolate torte.  The apple crumble in particular was the best we've ever had (and we have grandparents that are mean cooks).   The menu changes often and wasn't there on our last trip but I'm hoping for a revival!   I don't remember the wine we ordered,  but it was very well paired to our meals.

We've since been back and have sent other people there for their special evenings out.  Recently they have been deservedly VERY busy so you will need a reservation (available online through open table) but you can definitely go there confidently without reservation."}
{"text":"First time here.  Setting is nice.  Fancy enough to make me think I may be shot for coming in wearing jeans and a t-shirt.  I was heading to cover as much as I could.  Using a mirror, I'd peak around corners to spot potential assassins.  No threats seen.  I did a commando roll stopping under a nearby table.  I realized the person I'm meeting isn't here yet.  I took the chance and came out of cover.  No threat detected.  I avoided getting assassinated for dressing casual this time.

Let's start with the bathrooms.  I felt like a sumo wrestler walking into a telephone booth.  Or like I was in a test tube.  I needed to move to the side of the door to close it, and I'm not exactly a big guy.

We started, by my company's choosing, with a champagne cocktail.  This day is getting better already.  Eggs benedict immediately popped on the menu.  It's only 12:30.  I'm in.  After a few bites, I knew s*it was about to hit the fan.  I strip danced on the table.  So freaking good.  Hashbrowns were nice.  The benny was great, but the poached eggs were slightly undercooked.  They needed another 15-20 seconds in the water.  

It's a very nice spot.  Surrounded by neat antique shops, it may be hard to find.  I will come here again.  Server was great.  Very friendly lady that checked up periodically without being overbearing.  Keep an eye out for this spot folks."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is homey but very small. The service is friendly and light hearted. Think of high tea with classy ladies drinking tea with their pinkies up. The decor is a little of that mixed in with eccentric. I had the salmon Benedict which was ok. Honestly for some reason only chefs in Vancouver seem to know how to make hollandaise sauce right. Still it was a good sized meal for the price and the taste was pretty good for what I expected. I ad a soup and sandwich the next time and the soup was very tasty. You could tell it was made from scratch with high quality ingredients. I think it's a perfect place to go for brunch or lunch if you are looking for a small, quiet place to eat."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood gem in Inglewood. Great food, outstanding  service, cute restaurant."}
{"text":"Made a reservation, still had to wait over 45 minutes past reservation time for a table. Was told to come back in 15 minutes the first time. No table when we returned.  Second time asked them to call when table is ready. Reservation was at 7 didn't get seated until 7:50. 

They claimed it's because the previous table was late for their reservation. However,  it seemed other people who arrived after us got seated first.  They offered no apologies, waitress forgot things. Had to ask for bread and condiments that should have been there.

Won't be going back. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Review #21 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012

I heard about Jacqueline Suzanne's Bistro a couple years back from my boss.  She spoke very highly of this restaurant.... so it's always been on the radar and a place I've noticed every time I am in Inglewood.

Happy was I when I saw a Groupon come through for the bistro, so we purchased one.  I have to admit I was both worried and excited about using my Groupon here since I believe this can be a great marketing tool for restaurants to bring in new customers, wow them and make them repeat offenders.  However I've heard stories of customers using their Groupon and not getting great treatment.  Nonetheless we reserved a table for brunch (for the family) before we took in a show at the Loose Moose.

The decor inside will transport you back in time....it's fabulous.  The bistro is tucked away in an old heritage type building and as such the inside very much reflects history and what it might have been like back in the day.  We were seated upstairs and while the ceilings are rather low (husband skimmed the tiles with his noggin lol) the ceiling is composed of an antique metal or tin tile which adds to the ambiance of this place.

From the moment we walked in the service was impeccable.  It was also very busy with roars of laughter coming from down below.

We were handed the full menu and were pleased with the selections on the brunch menu so that is what we ordered.  The girl ordered a simple fruit bowl.  It was fresh & she loved it.  The boy was more adventurous and went for an omelet.  It arrived and was bigger then his head.  He managed to eat some of the fruit on the plate, a piece of toast and about 1/4 of the omelet.  Hubs had the prime rib with bacon/hash browns.  He also finished off the boy's omelet (good thing he has wooden leg).  My dear hubs loves his meat and declared the prime rib outstanding (beef & bacon - he was in heaven).  I decided to treat myself and went for the eggs benny with back bacon accompanied by a salad.  Everything fresh, portions large and delicious.

Love this bistro....it impressed us very much and as such we will be repeat offenders!"}
{"text":"Received yet another dinner invitation from my employer to yet another delightful Inglewood find; Jacqueline Suzanne's Bistro.  

It was a blistery night last night but the low lighting and intimate clusters of antique furniture make that all disappear and you feel like you are participating in a séance and JS is nothing short of enchanting.

Sat at an intimate seating of 6, complete with stained glass lamp and intricate decorative details.  Antique paintings hover over head and brass railings extend from the walls with luxurious fabrics to add privacy if so needed.  This is like a Victorian Parlour complete with antique piano which cranks out live jazz music on Friday and Saturday nights.

We started out the meal with a fine bottle of Chilean red and I ordered the Brie with Peach Chutney.  This is a whole order of brie, this accompanied with the wine and chutney was a fine orchestra of flavour. I was extremely satisfied.  I ordered the Neptune Filet for my entree which is Grade A steak covered with crab and generous garnishes of hollandaise sauce.  It was tender and cooked perfectly, and the combination of fresh ground pepper, the crab and hollandaise was superb.

Our waiter had the voice and charm of a radio announcer and he did well in guiding us through this flavourful journey.  I finished my meal with a nice hot cup of coffee, while others had dived into the cheesecake and Crème Brule and although I heard comments or praise, I was quite satisfied with what I had savoured.

Prices here at JS are around 10 to 40 for appetizers and entrees, but I feel it is well worth it.  It is a unique dining experience and is well worth trying.  While waiting for your meal feel free to shop for antiques that are available at the restaurant that are pictured and priced on the back of the menu.

Magnifique!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a really cute spot to go for lunch in Inglewood, hit up Jacqueline Suzanne's and remember to keep your pinky up.

The atmosphere is pretty old school. The material that made up the tableclothes matched the upholstery on the chairs. The ceiling even had a gold mock-gilded tile thing going on.

The food though is pretty tasty and the menu's got a good variety for lunch including some entrees, soups, salads, sandwiches and wraps.

And as the name suggests, it's furnished with entirely with \"antiquities.\""}
{"text":"I bought a voucher from dealfind for this place so it was time to give it a try.  I was glad that we didn't have to book 2 weeks in advance.  The decor is very vintage and kind of creepy and the waitress was tentative and had a sense of humor so that was refreshing.

We ordered the Rack of lamb and seafood pasta.  I must say the pasta was superb.  It had just the right amount of sauce and they used giant prawns and scallops.  I was very impressed with the overall appearance and flavor.  The rack of lamb on the other hand was not so good.  I like my meat medium rare but it came out almost well done.  I got them to make me another one but was still disappointed.  The meat was very chewy and had quite a different texture than normal.  It came with a sweet sauce that didn't go well with it either.
  
I had mixed reviews for this place so I'm not sure how the rest of the menu would turn out.  Prices are also quite high for the type of atmosphere and mediocre food.   I would recommend all the pasta lovers out there to try their seafood pasta here.
This was a place to try but I don't think I would be back."}
{"text":"I love this place! (More like a 4.5 star...but I reserve 5's for only my very elite tops)! My Mum took me there on Saturday for brunch. We had a lovely server who was friendly, helpful, and attentive.

We both had Benedicts. Myself the low carb Ben and she had the crab cake one. We both just about died from first bite to the last...they were so tasty and rich. What a perfect brunch on a cold wintry day.

I will totally become a regular!"}
{"text":"I have been to Jacqueline Suzanne's now 'Carmichaels' many times, mostly for brunch but a few times for dinner.
Stick to brunch!!

They had to comp 2 out of 4 meals plus the service well lets give that a 1/10.
I think they had maybe 6 tables and our order was not put in so we finally got it after an hour and the 2 Butternut Squash pastas were cold.

They took them and put them in the microwave and returned them to the table.
They should have been redone but instead they opted to just reheat the same ones!!!
Where is Chef Ramsey when you need him?

They have staff that is totally new for whatever reason so be very aware!

Save your money, there are so many better restaurants in Calgary!!!"}
{"text":"Alright, Jacqueline Suzanne's gets an update to a solid five stars.  My spouse and I decided to revisit JS's for our recent anniversary dinner.  At this point, my expectations were very high and we both were very satisfied, as we had yet another marvelous evening.  

My spouse enjoyed his last meal here so much that he ordered it again, which was the AAA  Alberta Filet Neptune.  Apparently it was made to perfection, just as it was a year ago.  I had the Chicken du Jour which included bacon and I enjoyed every morsel.  We also shared the Crab Cakes served with a Spicy Aioli, which was to die for and certainly had some kick.  The food was very rich and filling and I had leftovers, as my chicken portions were massive.  We had absolutely no room for dessert.  

By request, we were seated on the upper level of the restaurant near the window, which is considered the most romantic seating in the house, according to our server.  It's just so cozy and intimate that I could stay there for hours.  Again, service was great and you could tell that the server really enjoys her job.

Based on my third visit here, Jacqueline Suzanne's can do no wrong.

21/30 for Yelp's 30 Day Challenge"}
{"text":"I was excited about this place, but unfortunately the food has been mediocre lately! I love the ambiance and feel inside but at the end of the day it is always about the food.   I went for my third brunch and was hoping it was going to be a better dining experience but the quality of brunch has been deteriorating and needs a boost."}
{"text":"If you are looking for the best prime rib in Calgary, do try the Saturday night prime rib special~a carnivore's delight.  French bistro style atmosphere here, but with comfortable chairs and beautiful antiques. Quality food, desserts are yummy, espresso & full bar available.  I recommend Sunday brunch for the largest variety of tasty Eggs Benedict."}
{"text":"I really, really, really like this place.

Ok, I know that's a bit of a simplistic approach to a review, but at the same time, it's far too easy to get engrossed into writing a sophisticated review about Jacqueline Suzanne.  It's a fine dining resto, in a century-old building filled with antiques.  I've eaten there 3 times, and have never been personally disappointed in any of their offerings (well, except for the Jambalaya... but that's a tale for another day).

Let's start with my favorite dish there to start, the slow cooked Prime Rib with Yorkshire pudding and real gravy (not powdered! real gravy... those of you who are fans of the british version of Kitchen Nightmares would get the joke).  Tender enough to cut with my fork, savory and seasoned with something coming close to a Montreal steak spice blend, I simply cannot state how much I have enjoyed this dish, and easily is up there with some of the best steakhouse versions I have also tried in town (the Vintage, Chicago Chop and Buchanan's) and easily bests what used to be the measure for Prime Rib in Calgary, the Smuggler's Inn.  Served with a nice mashed potatoes, and simple steamed carrots, it was an excellent meal of equally decent proportions.

Now as for my dinner companion who has issues with beef, lamb, venison and all things dairy, the menu was .... er... a little sparce.  The chef will do his best to accomodate restrictive diets, but honestly, there won't be much.  He cooks with whole butter, rich creams and the like, and celebrates the richness of flavour and tastes in all things, from his take on calamari to the wonderfully fresh and properly torched creme brulée.  

Definately a place if you want to show off for your date, especial events, and a great meal on a night out with your other (whether he or she).  Just remember as I said, this is a place to celebrate rich full flavours of all sorts, so for the sadly dietary restricted, you might want to grab a snack first."}
{"text":"I came here last night after I wasn't able to get reservations at Muriettas Brought my friend who has never been and the first thing that she said was \"ooh, this is a really cute place!\"  

we started off with the escargot, crab cakes and the portebello stuffed mushroom cap (unfortunately I cannot remember what the stuffing consisted of but it was great!). We admit we were being a little ambitious with soo many starters and have 2 mains. 

She had some sort of vegetarian crepe thing, which was soo flavorful I thoroughly enjoyed her dish. A previous time I came here I had their special which was at the time a butternut squash ravioli with spinach in a coconut curry cream sauce, I asked the waiter if they could make it again and they were very accommodating with my request! The dish came out and it tasted like the first time I had it! PERFECT."}
{"text":"Came for brunch on a Saturday and the joint was hopping.  Brought the kids and even though the atmosphere is more upscale they were treated very well. 
  I enjoyed the classic Benny at the waitresses suggestion-it is their speciality. It was quite delish with nicely poached eggs, hash browns and fruit.  The man had the daily crepe with chicken and asparagus (same sides).  We tried each other's meal and think we both enjoyed the crepe the most.
  The kids split the raisin bread French toast which was a huge portion. They loved it! 
   Our server was very friendly and personable-a real asset!"}
