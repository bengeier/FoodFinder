{"text":"Swung by dailo last weekend and had an overall decent experience. First of all the atmosphere was beautiful. Really captures a scene from a wong kar wai film. The menus are also very well designed.  The food was pretty decent as well. I've been following chef nick for a while and had really high expectations for this place but I guess I expected a bit too much. The flavors were all familiar to me, some were a bit flat, some were too salty like the pork hock. I enjoyed the fried watermelon, an interesting combination of sourness and fish sauce. The watermelon texture acted like a sponge and sucked up all the flavors and pretty much exploded into your mouth. The trout had beautiful presentation although I wish there was more of that fried pepper and salt flavoring. The food reminded me of a mash of Vietnamese Thai and Chinese. Which isn't a bad thing but I guess I was anticipating something innovative and in return got food that I grew up with. Overall good experience and definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"They do fusian-Chinese food really well!  We shared several dishes (btwn 2 ppl):  1. sour pork  2. egg salad 3. lamb neck  2. empinada  All tasty and delicious! would highly recommend the food. The service was ok- they are a bit too talkative with you which can be a bit much when you are at dinner to enjoy the company of the people you are there with. Also I asked for more bread slices and the waiter told me 'sure, IF you're done what you have'....and when we finished it he obviously didn't come back...kind of annoying/rude..."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  Like many other reviewers, I came to DaiLo with high expectations. My experience was decent, but certainly not what I would expect from a restaurant that has been highly praised by multiple magazines. I tried their tasting menu, which had in store all of DaiLo's signature dishes.   Great (4/5): My favourite were definitely the sweet and sour pork hock and the beef carpaccio. Both served in deliciois sauces -- I was scooping up the sauces even after all the meat was gone.   Good (3.5/5): The crispy octopus tacos were pretty good. They were my companion's favourite dish. The fried watermelons were interesting as well, though not incredibly special.   Mediocre (3/5): The pumpkin dumplings were a little too creamy/rich/sweet for my taste. The wontons were also not anything special. The \"main,\" larger dishes were a disappointment. The truffle fried rice was dry and bland; strange given that it seems to be a popular dish. The laksah (which doesn't seem to be on the menu -- perhaps it was a special?) tasted like khao soi you would get at a decent  thai restaurant. Sugar cake, my choice of dessert, was really not that great either. I could see that they tried to be inventive with bold flavours, but overall, the cake was too sweet and the strong syrup, not too my liking."}
{"text":"Went there on Saturday -2 couples.  Great atmosphere, place was packed.  We order pretty much everything on the menu(it's a short menu but sweet).  It was DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!! Service was friendly and informative about every dish that came out.  Price was reasonable approx $100 per person but with a lot of alcohol and tons of food.   Any way .....I definitely recommend and I\"ll be back."}
{"text":"I had drinks and appetizers at the main floor bar with some girlfriends. We had a great time, which the exceptional service and cocktails contributed to (our favorite was the refreshing and dangerously easy to drink Tom Yum cocktail). The room is beautiful, with golden hand-painted Chinoiserie wallpaper and excellent lighting. It felt like there was buzz in the room, a excitement that comes from staff that know they work in a hot spot, and care that things are done right.   That being said, the food was hit and miss, which made us feel like it was a bit overhyped. The pumpkin dumplings were sweet and buttery - they could have been a dessert, and lacked acidity. The pork belly was rich and savory in the best way, but the fried watermelon was underwhelming. The texture was almost fibrous, and reminded me of a tomato. The flavors were okay, but not exciting. We really enjoyed the duck tacos and Big Mac Bao though. They're only being offered at the cocktail bar upstairs now, but it wasn't hard to talk the server into bringing them down. I feel like that was the dish that summed up the night - a great experience that you're excited about, but not something you'd want every day."}
{"text":"The tacos were great, the watermelon was interesting.  It's a nicely designed restaurant but...  The service was oddly condescending and rude to each other which left us feeling uncomfortable -there was some mysterious hierarchy that was in extreme effect.  Some dishes were good and many were meh and in general inconsistent. Not what I'd expect from a establishment at that price point."}
{"text":"Went to DaiLo with friends last night after rave reviews by other foodie friends of ours.  The space itself is ok, I wouldn't call it a great atmosphere but ok.  The menu is a collection of rather intriguing, sometime exotic, and sometime whimsical entries that can be chosen under appetizers or mains.    All food is designed to be shared and we appreciated the smaller portions to avoid overeating while sampling multiple dishes.  For appetizers, we had Crispy Octopus Fresh Roll (9/10), Fried Watermelon (interesting but frivolous, 5/10), Hakka Brown Wontons (7/10), Sweet and Sour Pork Hock (8/10), Singapore Curry Cauliflower (7/10).  For mains we shared Truffle Fried Rice (the best of the dishes, 9/10), Whole Fried Giggie Trout (6/10), and slow cooked beef ribs (not on the menu, but very fatty and the worst dish of all, 5/10).  Flavours and textures were, for the most part, well composed.  But overall the result is a bit hit and miss, with some dishes that are different and good, and others that are different but not entirely satisfying.  Service was competent.   I enjoyed the experience and the novelty, but would not come here again."}
{"text":"My husband and I are fans of Top Chef Canada so we were very excited to try DaiLo because of Dennis. We were not disappointed! Chef's choice menu was amazing and we also got to meet Denis who is the nicest guy. We got to try many different dishes which were all beyond excellent and the portion sizes were generous. Our server Julia was the best. We left stuffed and satisfied. Our experience was so great that we're coming back again tomorrow with a friend."}
{"text":"Favourite restaurant in Toronto hands down. Amazing service and incredible food. Recommend highly!!"}
{"text":"The bottom line: This place tries to be hipster and charges you a hefty price for the novelty while serving you slightly above average food.  I mean, it's a little expected since it's \"Chinese and French fusion,\" right? Overall the food was decent but nothing special. We ordered 6 dishes (3 \"large\" ~$20-25 dishes and 3 \"small\" ~$10) for 3 people and it came out to just above $40 per person including tax and tip. The fried watermelon was interesting, the truffle fried rice was nice, and one other dish that was basically beef carpaccio was good. Everything else such as the wontons and roast duck tacos were pretty forgettable. Their spicy dishes tasted pretty much all the same - some mix of  curry, XO sauce, chili peppers, and oyster sauce.  The atmosphere was nice with dim lighting (which made eating our curry crab very interesting), good seating and modern decor. The waitstaff were superb. They took my winter coat before I sat down and were always explaining the dishes and refilling our water.  It's too bad that the food was barely above average and overpriced for the quality that we were given. I would rather go to Guu for slightly cheaper, enjoy a seafood dinner at one of the more upscale Chinese restaurants for around the same price, or go big for a steak at Canoe. I won't be returning to DaiLo."}
{"text":"Went there on a Friday night and it was very slow. We actually thought they forgot our final course.   We had the deep fried watermelon which was interesting but could have had a better sauce with it. The best part of the meal was the cauliflower which was very good but came last and by that time we were aching to leave. In the end the food kind of all tasted the same with no real standouts.   Not sure I will go back but you never know when la carnita and bar raval are full & you're desperate!"}
{"text":"The place is gorgeous and the service was impeccable. We loved the truffled fried rice and the curried cauliflower.  They did the tasting menu as a vegetarian option for me and brought my wife some meat options in a clever way so we could still share.  We can't wait to return for the cocktails!!"}
{"text":"Had the silken tofu, Singapore cauliflower, and the truffle rice.  The concept of the food and restaurant is interesting but the food itself leaves something wanting, something about each dish didn't taste quite right and the flavours seemed off. Have definitely had better fusion. We also got a bit of food poisoning from one of the dishes. The service was nice and friendly though."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to DaiLo with a group of 6 other people and did the tasting menu. The food was nothing short of incredible.   The service was top-notch. Our waiter began by asking if anyone has any restrictions to the tasty menu and then served accordingly. This worked out very well as one of the group does not eat meat, so they provided her with a vegetarian option while the rest of us consumed lamb and beef.   The tasting menu was a lot larger than originally anticipated. We ended up trying over half the menu. Every dish was delicious, however the pumpkin dumplings and truffle rice are must haves.   I am already planning my next trip back!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough about the delicious, surprising flavours in such stand-out dishes as the pumpkin dumplings (so lucious) and the ponzu beef carpaccio. That said, there were times we felt somewhat ripped off. The beef carpaccio comes in a to-die-for sauce that cannot be consumed with either the chopsticks or forks provided, forcing one to ask for--bread? rice--to soak it up. Sticky rice is offered--for an extra $4, on top of the (small) $12 dish. This is cheap on the part of the restaurant; rice should be served alongside the beef at no extra charge. Furthermore, the $14 cocktails we ordered consisted of mostly crushed ice. They're tasty, all right, but hardly worth half the price. And last, although we were surrounded by free tables and ate quite quickly, we got the distinct impression the staff wanted us out of there as soon as we'd finished: there were multiple offers for the bill and multiple returns to the table to see whether we were ready to pay. We were practically hustled into our coats and out the door."}
{"text":"2 stars because the cocktail I ordered was amazing (the Melona 22).  the food was heavy and drenched in oil and sauce and raclette etc etc. Our waiter was awful - although there seemed to be other friendlier wait staff serving other tables, just not ours. Spend you money somewhere else."}
{"text":"Gorgeous atmosphere and decor. Vintage images and hand-painted art scenes. Just Beautiful.  Service was excellent.  The night I was there I had the Jellyfish Slaw - yummy, and the Whole Fried Giggie Trout - I picked the bones clean it was so good! - especially the fatty cheeks and neck area. The aioli and soy glaze dipping sauces were also great.   BIG fan - I will be back!"}
{"text":"Was here a couple of weeks ago with some friends for dinner. Decor was nice, but I'm here to eat.  The wait staff was polite and our waiter was excellent; explained the concept, the dishes and suggested what to order so we'd get a nice spread of variety and enough to eat. Really nice start!  Then came what I would describe as a mess of dishes that felt like it came from different restaurants and the minds of several chefs. A standout for me was the prawn. Very crispy and flavorful, but really heavy. The ravioli, nice texture and good flavor, but overly heavy. The fried rice with trouffles, nice, but you give any Asian some trouffles and day old rice, it'll be just as good or better. We got the shumai as well... The waiter described it beautifully, but the texture and flavor would be something that Asian diners would actually complain about; a mushy mess. After 6 or 7 dishes, I remain confused about what I was eating and how they tied together.   We were done, and right about the time when the shumai came, my mind started to wander as did one of my friends. Someone suggested jokingly that we hit up Asian legend for dumplings after as we were not satisfied with the portions sizes or the quality of flavor that we were getting there.   The bill came and we were a bit blown away. Yes we read the prices, but I think our stomachs were confused as to how dissatisfied we were still. $50 a person for something I expected much much more and better.  We proceeded to Asian legend, got 2 trays of soup filled dumplings and the onion beef roll for $18, tax, tip, in.  If you didn't grow up with Asian food and have deep pockets and are light on expectations, you may want to try Dailo. But if you're a true food purist where you're looking for great food for a reasonable price, there are many excellent alternatives available in our city."}
{"text":"4/5! I totally understand why it's so hard to get reservations at this place! Great food and unique choices. I recommend the chef tasting menu so you get an opportunity to try a variety of dishes. Warning: you will be extremely full by the end. I also recommend their lychee cocktail. My favourite dishes were the following: fried watermelon, pork and shrimp dumpling, truffle fried rice and fresh rolls. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Last December my family dined here. It was hands down one of the best meals I've ever had. We ordered the entire menu and surprisingly still had room to order dishes from the cocktail bar upstairs, LoPan. One of the coolest parts of the night was having the head chef, Nick, inform us that we were the first party he's seen order everything"}
{"text":"Rating:  3.5 stars.  I've been wanting to try out this restaurant, esp. with friends' and colleagues' recommendations and raves about this place.  Perhaps my expectations were too high based on this feedback, but I found my dinner to be good, but not blow-me-away good!  I'm really glad to have finally dined here, and cross this off my list, though.  Service was fairly laid back yet attentive.  When our server got busy with a larger party, others always stepped in to ensure that our meal moved along without issue.  I had a cockail that was pretty fun - a Tikki drink, served in a heavy copper pineapple-shaped vessel. A little awkward for a table for two, but the \"pineapple\" certainly made for a conversation piece.  Onto the food...Because I'd heard so much about the various dishes, we opted to go a la carte instead of trying the chef's choice, to ensure we got a chance to try all the dishes that we'd heard about:  -  Ponzu beef carpaccio - 2/5.  Very salty, and a very small portion of carpaccio for the price.   -  Pumpkin dumplings - 4/5.  A very rich tasting dish with 5 little dumplings on offer.  Perhaps a wee bit too sweet, but otherwise a very distinct taste. -  Big Mac \"bao\" - 2/5.  This wasn't on the menu, but the server said that we could order it.  This was perhaps the biggest disappointment of the night.   -  Mapo Doufu Halloumi - 3/5.  The pieces of Halloumi were tiny, and while we know Halloumi can be salty, the dish was overpoweringly salty, and lacked the spices and layers of flavour in the usual mapo tofu dish. -  Truffled fried rice - 3.5/5 - I liked it, but my dining companion did not.  I feel that the truffle put a spin on traditional fried rice and worked really well.   He felt taht it was still quite ordinary in taste. -  Fried Giggie Trout - 3.5/5 - we liked this, especially the presentation, but found it a little greasy.  We mostly ate it plain, after tasting the three dipping sauces that came with it, and finding them to be nothing extarordinary.  The pace of the meal was nice;  we were not rushed, and the above was enough to fill us up.  Would we be rushing to go back?  Probably not.  I'd probably opt for a really fancy Chinese meal up in Markham instead if these are the kinds of flavours I'm craving."}
{"text":"Amazing!  Went with the Chefs tasting menu for 3, with one person having very specific restrictions. Ryan and the rest of the DaiLo team killed it."}
{"text":"The experience my friends and I had at DaiLo was underwhelming. I'm not sure if it's because we had set our expectations too high but the restaurant to us was mediocre with bad rice. We had the beef carpaccio baby lotus root, the spicy crab (special for the night), truffle fries rice and quail. The beef carpaccio and lotus root had good flavour. XO sauce that came with the rice was tasty but the fried rice itself was hard and undercooked. The crab and quail came with sticky rice that was hard and dry too and the dishes itself did not make much of an impression."}
{"text":"Came with a friend visiting town the other day, since we had a good experience at the Gwai Lo pop-up restaurant.   Reservations are pretty full for a Tuesday night, we booked 3 days before but only managed to get a table at 9pm. So make a reservation early if you are planning on going!  This is an Asian Fusion restaurant, and it did not fail our expectations, The dishes are all quite good. We grew up with Chinese food and their dishes did well with an interesting twist.   We ordered quite a lot of food for sharing and I do recommend sharing at Dailo, so you get to try out different dishes!  We did not like the desserts though, they feel a little weird, maybe we are too used to \"normal\" desserts...."}
{"text":"Let's get one thing straight: this is contemporary Asian fusion with a tinge of hipster - and it's amazing! Got the chefs tasting menu ($50/pp) and it was well worth it.   Dailo is not for the faint of heart or those looking to watch their wallet. In turn, they serve up some of the freshest cocktails ($15) around. The dishes were creative and a delight to the senses. This dinner was an experience and if you are up in the lounge - you have to test out their Big Mac bao. Honestly, the economics don't make sense, but it is the only Big Mac that you will feel amazing an hour after eating!  Music was lounge/chill and the vibe was cool. Staff was also quick and on point. Great for a special night out!"}
{"text":"There's countless reasons why DaiLo was near the top of Air Canada enRoute's 2015 Canada's Best New Restaurants list. As someone that grew up eating traditional Chinese food, it was refreshing to see a restaurant concept whose food was Chinese, with French influences, rather than the typical fusion food out there that is French, with Chinese (and other Asian cuisines) influences. If you're hungry, and dining with people that have seen you eat a lot of food before with little to no shame about it, go for the Chef's Special. It's 7-9 courses (broken down into amuse bouches, small, medium and large plates) and features several off-menu items (typically the daily specials). It's unlikely you'll get all of DaiLo's signature dishes when you order the Chef's Special (we were served the fried watermelon, which was amazing, but not the deep fried whole fish, for example), so if that's what you want, order a la carte instead. Overall, the restaurant brought back so many food memories for me. From their spin on traditional congee using fish and Chinese fried dough to dip, Peking duck but with lamb's neck, and condensed milk ice cream over a donut that reminded me of having condensed milk on toast as a child, DaiLo is innovative and succeeds at paying homage to classic Chinese dishes without compromising their traditional ingredients, technique or flavour. Major props for having attentive and knowledgable wait staff, and a useful online reservation system ."}
{"text":"Had the Chef's choice option Sunday night. The experience was noting less than spectacular. My favorite dishes were the Pumpkin Dumplings & Fried Giggie Trout. The rib eye was my least favorite. Don't get me wrong the beef was great but everything else was so creative and full of complex flavours....the beef just didn't stand up. Service was attentive and friendly. Highly recommend! Can't wait for my next trip to T.O."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and great service. The pork hock and Big Mac bao were definite favorites! The sweet and sour sauce on the pork was incredible. My husband and I also both enjoyed our cocktails. Finally, if it is on the menu, you have to order the Vietnamese Tiramisu! We never order dessert, but our server recommended it and it was amazing. The Vietnamese coffee paired with fresh orange zest and coconut cake was great! All around enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Unbelievable meal and service at Dialo last night (Dec 30) Geoffrey F was a brilliant server which made the amazing meal turn into an amazing experience.  Gotta try the tasting menu if in a group of 4 or more."}
{"text":"We ordered the tasting menu with wine pairings. The courses started out very small (one bite appetizers) and progressively got bigger and bigger. By the end we were pleasantly full. Each and every dish we had was not only exceptionally delicious but also unique and creative, like nothing we had ever eaten before. We had a blast talking about each dish as we ate it, as each dish warranted a full discussion. The wines pairings were perfectly chosen, and were also quite unique and discussion-worthy. It was one of those evenings where the food/wine was the main event. I will never forget this meal and I can't wait to repeat the experience with everyone I know"}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews but this time I had to.  I like to dine at new places and find out what they are about. I heard about this place and decided to check this place out. I called on Sunday November 2nd just to make sure they are open, the girl on the other side of the phone was very kind. I got in at 8:00 pm and asked for a table for one, they tried to look for a seat for me but as the Girl was looking at the POS three guys walked in. They had reservation but even tho I was waiting   There to be seated they were sat first. I brushed it off, the server came and asked if I would like some water. I noticed not all tables have flowers, it would be nice to be consistent ( I know I'm picky) I was not impressed by the menu there was no chicken dish, however there was quail and duck.  Most of the items in the menu was pork. In ordered the steak. As I was waiting for the meal I noticed every table  was getting  hot towel at the beginning of the seating. Okay I know I was only one person but what happen the the treating the customers the same, bad 1st impression. My meal arrived, very nice presentation and the server explained the content if the dish well. Taste was very well balanced. Over all I was happy with this place. It would have been nicer if the menu had more chicken / beef.  And paid a little more attention to customer (hot towel situation)."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of dining at Dai Lo last night with 3 friends, and from the start we were treated impeccably. Complimentary sparkling or still water (really, every restaurant should do this), warm geranium scented towels to clean your hands, and a very thorough explanation of the menu ensued. Our group opted for the chef's choice tasting menu, a steal at $50 a person for the variety, complexity and sheer volume of dishes you receive. Everything was delicious but the standouts include: deep fried watermelon and pickled watermelon rind, betel leaf, soft tacos with duck, 90 day aged steak with chimichurri sauce and bok choy, deep fried whole fish (so good I cleaned the bones) and truffle fried rice. We also sampled the on tap riesling which was surprisingly good, and had two amazing bottles of grenache. As if the impressive food wasn't enough, our waiter made the evening even more enjoyable, describing the details of the menu with enthusiasm that only a foodie and a person who loves his job could.   I will definitely be back to try the a la carte menu which looks amazing. It's a place to eat slowly and spend a few hours with good friends. They take their time to make sure you enjoy your meal and don't rush you. Oh, did I mention how gorgeous the space is? There's also an upstairs section for late night eats, open until 2 AM. Fantastic!"}
{"text":"Went in the summer of 2015. Chef Nick Liu had created a creative and delicious Asian fusion menu to live up to its bad-ass name meaning \"big brother\" or \"boss\".  Upstairs, the restaurant offers a dim sum/snack bar with a cocktail menu. On the main floor, the decor has many retro Chinese accents in warm tones with a combination of booths and long tables for the seating.  Some of my favourite items include the Big mac bao, fried watermelon (SO creative!), and lamb neck. I never had lamb neck before it was tender and paired well with the wrappers with hoisin sauce.   The restaurant had a vibrant atmosphere, played great music (they played 80s tunes when I went), and was a great place to share delicious eats and creative cocktails among friends."}
{"text":"When I see Asian fusion or as Nick Liu calls it \"New Asian Cuisine\", I'm usually skeptical as it usually equates to small portions with high prices.  I don't mind paying for good food, but if I can get something similar in Chinatown than the place had to offer, then it's nothing special and just hyped up by being known as Asian fusion because of an extra ingredient or two.  I have walked by DaiLo on many occasions and was always curious to try the place because of Nick Liu, but being known as an Asian fusion place, it just kept me astray.    My first visit was last week  and upon entering  the restaurant, the hostess was very welcoming and friendly.  The place is beautifully adorned with both Asian and  western furnishings which is fitting for the Asian fusion restaurant.  Plus I love how the DaiLo was designed to look like Chinese character which adds a nice flair for the Asian inspired menu with some modern western touches.  I was happy my first visit was with a good sized group of five to try their tapas style menu.  The chef's tasting menu looked like a great deal priced at $55/person, but since we had a few people at the table with food allergies  we couldn't choose that option because everyone at the table must order the tasting menu.  Therefore, we ordered a variety of plates to share that varied in food quantities and prices.  Fried watermelon ($9): sounded odd, but interesting at the same time.  Anything fried is good, right?  Watermelon was lightly breaded and fried to a nice crisp served with bean sprouts, basil leaves, pickled melon rind, pork floss.  The flavours definitely blended well together and was very tasty.  I was pleasantly surprised by the taste.  Fried Silken Tofu ($11) was served with a smoky miso sauce, seaweed salad, honey mushrooms.  Seemed a little pricey for what we received, but the tofu was definitely silky and smooth and all the ingredients tasted well together. Plus again anything fried is good.  Ponzu Beef Carpaccio ($12): 90 day Olliffe rib cap, yuzu soy caramel, truffle dwarf peach, pickled chili, fried garlic, cilantro.  It was definitely flavourful, but a little too saucy for my liking (which is unusual as I like sauces) and all the ingredients seemed to mask the real taste of the beef. I guess I'm just used to beef carpaccio as a stand alone meat dish that is lightly marinated with no saucy residue.  Mapo \"Doufo\" Halloumi ($14): Montforte halloumi with grilled scallions, black bean chili sauce, fried chilies and garlic.  For the small dish we received this seemed very overpriced as we only received perhaps a handful of the halloumi in small pieces (i.e. 5 pieces perhaps 6)  Sticky rice at $3 per bowl was a little on the dried side and not as sticky as I would expect it to be.  I only had a few spoonfuls which I drenched with sauce from the silken tofu dish.  Sweet and Sour Pork Hock ($14): Po Po's original sauce, crispy shallot, garlic, almond crumble served in a small bowl with a side of jelly fish slaw. The pork definitely tasted like my grandma's sweet and sour pork spareribs minus the almond crumble.  Pork was tasty, but rather small in portion as we probably received 10 pieces of pork.  WIld BC side stripe prawn Banh Xeo ($20): This dish is a fried Vietnamese crepe  served with with pork terrine, bean sprouts. basil, chili jam vinegar which needs to be cut into portions, then placed in lettuce leaf and wrapped like a roll.  It was delightful as the ingredients blended well together which added to the flavourful taste. I'm not sure if this warrants the price because it wasn't too overwhelming.  Mongolian grilled lamb neck ($29);  Two pieces of meat served with sambal pickled cucumber & celery, chili, chive pancakes and hoisin.  The lamb was very tender and tasty as the meat fell off the bone nicely.  Probably the most enjoyed dish of the night for me since it was meaty goodness.  The good thing about tapas style eating is you get to share with your fellow diners, but because of the small menu and the limited selection due to food allergies in our group, I felt like we didn't have enough food and I was still hungry.  Plus being a group of runners, we all have a healthy appetite, but because we had a late reservation, we didn't over order as we didn't want to eat too much so late in the night.  I will probably come back to try the chef's tasting menu with friends who don't have any food allergies in order to sample a wider range of the menu.    Overall, food menu is a little pricey, but the flavourful food makes it reasonable and the service we received was friendly, efficient and timely.  Plus the  presentation of the bill in a lucky red envelope added a nice Asian flair.  Luckily for us we didn't order too much food or drink too much, so our bill was reasonable.  Most cocktails priced at $14 and wines by the glasses from $10 and up  are the norm for places like this.  It's definitely worth a try if you're in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"We were seated right by the front window although I had asked for a booth. Probably because we were only two, but it would have been nice if they addressed the choice. I didn't want to fuss as it was my husband's birthday. It was quite cool but I think either this changed or the wine made me feel much warmer over the course of the night.   We had the watermelon (fab), egg net salad (skip), wontons (nice), pork hock (lovely if a bit fatty for our taste), truffle fried rice (devoured), and fried fish (marvy).  Two cocktails and a bottle of Norman Hardy Chardonnay. Which was also just amazingly good. Now we have to buy a case. :(  We were quite happy. The music was absolutely on target both volume and genre. If I could remember what they played, I would tell you, but I can't, because wine. Lots of soul. 60s stuff. Modern too. All good.   Our servers were also exceedingly attentive and knew the menu well. When they weren't sure about something, they gave an easy answer then made sure to get someone more knowledgable to fill in the blanks for us without missing a beat or making any fuss. We will go back once the menu is updated again."}
{"text":"Small bites and drinks at the bar, Clint is a great bartender and gave us a great experience at the bar. The front of house seems to be really well trained on the menu by articulating and explaining the menu really well, but not over doing it. Enjoyed the ponzu beef carpaccio, extremely well seasoned and lots of flavour. Definitely not a dish you that you get to try seasoned with chinese/japanese flavours."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had in Toronto in a long while. Great atmosphere, friendly and attentive service and a refreshing menu that did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Wife and I had the Crispy Octopus tacos, Fried Watermelon,  Truffle Fried Brown Rice and  Char Siu Pork Loin. They all tasted good. But nothing special.  The tacos are very tasty. But just about as tasty as what you can get from many much more casual restaurants or food trucks in T.O. For a restaurant that claims French tradition, some more complexity would be expected.  The fried watermelon cubes worked well with basil and bean sprouts. I suspect though, that riper melon might do better. It was probably partly my fault for ordering watermelon this time of the year.  The Truffle Fried Brown Rice proved all my doubts about using brown rice for fried rice very very reasonable. The rice texture was kind of in between your traditional fried rice and risotto, missing the best parts from both, and it refused to be the medium where all the flavours mesh.   The Char Siu Pork Loin came with buns that made a great combo with the sauce. But they were a bit too sticky for my taste when I chewed them. My wife didn't like the dish very much because pork loin is a much less juicy cut than butt or shoulder. Still, it was worth recommending.  Overall, it really felt like a lot of work has been put into these dishes. There is nothing to complain about any of the ingredients. Sadly, all the fancy work they threw in there just didn't quite come together to form anything amazing. Fusion is hard to get right. But the expectation was that they could."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. Attentive to allergies that you may have. Octopus tacos, soju pear, and fried winter melon are must-trys, truffle fried rice was a bit too salty for our taste."}
{"text":"Ever since my first bite of the Big Mac Bao I had at YumChaTO earlier this year, I was intrigued by Chef Nick Liu's way of cooking \"New Asian Cuisine.\" With a bunch of pop-ups and participation in various events in the Toronto food scene, Nick Liu is well know to many foodies. When it was announced that he will finally have a basecamp, a kitchen to call his own, we were eagerly awaiting the opening.   The restaurant is divided into 2 separate areas: DaiLo - the bar and dining room on the ground floor and LoPan, a more casual cocktail & snack bar upstairs (also with a separate entrance).  The decor in both area is authentic, elegant and welcoming with Chinese influences.  LoPan showcases floating dumpling or fortune cooking shaped creating a fun and playful ambiance, true to what the upstairs bar is to its restaurant counterpart downstairs.  I ate:Crispy Octopus Fresh Roll ($13.00) Sweet & Sour Pork Hock ($13.00) Smoked Trout Betel Leaf ($4.00) Eggnet Salad ($12.00) Singapore Curry Cauliflower ($18.00) Whole Fried Giggi Trout ($30.00)  I couldn't pick a favourite of the night - it's impossible! Each dish showcased the ingredients to its fullest in terms of flavour and texture, not to mention that the presentation is a feast for the eyes. But if I hate to pick, it would be the Fried Giggi Trout!"}
{"text":"I had a great experience here. The food was amazingly delicious. The beef carpaccio... I had to order a side of sticky rice to soak up the sauce. Yup. The service was great, our server was super on the ball. Atmosphere was nice. Would definitely come back. Apparently you have to go upstairs to try the Big Mac Bao, next time!"}
{"text":"This spot had been on our list for quite some time now after reading/hearing impressive reviews.   The interior of the restaurant is gorgeous and tastefully decorated. We sat almost right under the skylight at the bar.   My 3 star review is all about the food. The service, on the other hand, was nothing short of wonderful. The bartender was welcoming, informative and friendly. The servers who brought our food made sure to itemize every ingredient in the dish for us since we were first timers.  Now the food...  Mai Tai: Heavy on the rum, which I'm never angry about, but I felt like it heavily overshadowed any other ingredients. I wasn't able to distinguish any other layers.   Beef Carpaccio: Texturally appealing, but swimming in sauce which masked the taste of the beef. I know Asian cuisine is usually very saucy, so this twist on carpaccio is fitting. I won't lie, I'm a sauce girl so I really enjoyed this dish.  Pork Hock: Crispy on the outside, a little sweet, but again, I know that's a staple of this cuisine. It was good.   Poached Baby Lotus Root: Taste-wise, this was the most unique. The soy hollandaise was creamy and full of flavour. The lotus root was very stringy and a little weird to eat, but had an addictive crunch to it.   A good experience. Nothing really blew my mind, and I probably wouldn't go back, not because of anything subjectively bad at all, but once was satisfactory."}
{"text":"I like this restaurant. The best Chinese I ever tasted beside Shanghai Terrace in Chicago. I like black truffle fried rice with XO sauce, dumpling with XO sauce, the pork with home made sweet and sour sauce. The Kung fu fizz was delicious. I like the fact that He restaurant is in the neighborhood area, and away from touristy."}
{"text":"Food: 8/10 Atmosphere: 9/10  Service: 9/10 Overall experience: 8.5/10  Though my scores above seem high, I am only giving DaiLo 3/5 stars for one reason: I expect more from Asian Fusion.   As it becomes more and more popular, I find I am becoming more and more judgmental. It is not enough to take a classic Asian dish (that you would be able to get for $6+tax family style in Markham/Scarborough), add some garlic aioli, and call it \"fusion.\"  DaiLo is not be any means a bad restaurant. The decor is quite innovative (one of the \"chandeliers\" is actually a huge wok turned upside down - something I found extremely creative) and the service is great.   The food as well is fine. Definitely above average, but again, I think part of the lure/appeal of a place like this is the experience - the decor, the service, the trendy \"Asian\" cuisine.   My dinner partner and I shared: - crispy octopus fresh roll - sweet and sour pork hok - truffle fried rice - satay grilled quail - big mac bao (a special order from what is normally only available upstairs)  THE BOTTOM LINE: the trendiness of the restaurant will keep you coming back more than the food will."}
{"text":"The regular restaurant was full so we had to eat upstairs where the menu is limited.  We had a special dumpling sampler, fried rice, duck confit wings and wontons.  The only item disappointing was the fried rice.  There just wasn't much flavor.  I was also disappointed by the wine selection.  They only have 4 reds by the glass.  I can not attest to it but my husband enjoyed their cocktails."}
{"text":"delicious dinner and amazing service. We fell in love with this place and will definitely be back. Our favourites were the big mac bao and the truffle rice. The big mac bao tasted like a big mac but better (if that's even possible). I had to fight my husband for the last few bites of the truffle rice. Can't wait til I go back again."}
{"text":"this place is a gem & is a must.. Every person should treat them self to the chef menu and sit back and enjoy the variety of delicious mouth watering plates that come to your table.. Truffle fried rice amazing! Crispy Octopus Taco's order double!! Pecking Duck breast, they had me at pecking & the infamous 90 day dry aged rib eye is something you have to eat if its the last thing you can eat.....  people go here and go here often"}
{"text":"I chose this place after seeing it being rated top new restaurant in Canada in the air canada food issue.   I was not impressed. Starting with the server. Asked him for recommendations but he just listed the name of the dishes on the menu, without any explanation. Definitely not a server at the caliber that should be associated with an upper end restaurant.   The food came out, it was alright. It wasn't bad. But if this is rated one of the top new restaurants in Canada. I was expecting at least to be wow'd by the food."}
{"text":"Unimpressed.  I don't get why DaiLo has so many rave reviews, I've been twice now and am certainly sure the food is not exciting, innovative, new or anything to really salivate over for that matter.  Most recently I had the chef's tasting menu which covered a lot of their regular menu and I have come to the conclusion that DaiLo is just not for me. Sure some things were interesting but the execution just was not there.  Some dishes we had:  Fried watermelon -it's exactly what it sounds like, battered watermelon fried with some mint to compliment, can't go wrong with mint and watermelon. I could certainly do without the fried aspect as it did not add any extra dimension to the dish.  Octopus taco - I liked how it was on a jicama shell, however, the octopus pieces were very small and over fried in my opinion.  It was however one of the better dishes.  Miso Salt Cod Brandade  - Came with fried dough bread (the type you get the congee). was O.K   Truffle Fried Rice - Meh. truffle flavour was minimal, aside from that it was just regular fried rice.   Duck - was presented to us as 'Pecking Duck' basically regular duck confit and some portions of sous vide duck breast. flavours were non-asian inspired. I think this dish was lost (geographically speaking) in the tasting menu.    Pork Belly - Way over fried (meat was extremely dry), sauce was way too salty.  Beef carpaccio - the ponzu sauce was salty, the dish was overwhelmed. Could not taste the delicately cut beef.  Butternut Squash dumplings - The dumplings were over boiled, skin was way too soft.  The sauce was made with white rabbit candies, over sweet considering the filling is also sweet.  Other dishes that were less notable but part of the tasting menu; Fried trout Egg Net salad Wonton dumplings Duck Liver Moose on crostini Smoked Trout Betel Leaf Yu Choy with Kimchi and fried ocra    Overall impressions:  Way to much deep fried dishes, made the meal feel very heavy. I may also note the oil they used was slightly rancid/old which I tasted in every fried dish.  The flavours always seem to lean towards soy sauce, garlic, green onions, hot peppers.  Seemed like they tried to stick everything chinese into each dish (white rabbit candy in sauce, using congee crullers as crostinis, sticky rice in place of regular white rice, dried pork strings as a topping) which didn't pair as seamlessly as one would expect.  Dishes were swimming in sauce, which overwhelmed the palette. Way too salty overall.  I would have liked to have seen more delicate dishes. Chinese food is more than soy sauce, hoisin sauce and siracha."}
{"text":"The good:  Some truly amazing and inventive dishes, in particular the pumpkin dumplings and the miso salt cod brandade. My mouth just watered thinking about them. The service was thoughtful, and the waiter (somm's?) thoughts on the wine by the glass were informative without being excessive. We walked away feeling on the whole that we'd had an excellent meal.  The bad(ish):  The menu online hasn't been updated to match current prices. Every / most dish has gone up by a buck (ie. truffle rice is now $21 not $20) and the chef's selection has jumped by $10 ($65 vs $55). The resto should fix this right away.   The portion sizes are small, which I don't mind per se - it is more fun to try lots of dishes - but the prices on a couple of the dishes seemed skewed (truffle rice and watermelon in particular).  I'd skip the watermelon in future, as well as the truffle rice - it is such a small portion (rice! $21!) and the flavours just don't blow me away (and this is coming from a truffle fiend)."}
{"text":"I've been to Dai Lo twice last year. Both times, with different parties, I have had the Tasting Menu (Chef's choice). The first time, it was my host's choice and it gave our party of 4 a wonderful overview of the entire menu.   The second time I went, it was a party of two. The tasting menu was still a great option. It covers many items you would wish to try anyhow. I am a bit of a spice/heat wimp and one of the dishes caught me off guard, but I wouldn't let that put anybody off. Look up their menu, and give it a try.  What I really enjoyed about the service at DaiLo is you don't have just one server. Everyone is in on it, so you're not left wanting a glass of water and trying to catch your server's eye. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Yummy, well priced, friendly service and nice ambience.   Decided to leave this place for Alo, as food didn't wow us.  Open to visiting again, in the distant future.  Overall 3.5/5"}
{"text":"My highest dining experience so far in Toronto. We had the tasting menu. Each course was deep in flavor and texture. Usually I am very skeptical of asian fusion, but this one was executed brilliantly. Service was top notch. A real gem"}
{"text":"Dim lighting - to make it even more upscale and intimate I presume. There's a small menu (at least at dinner) which must people seem to share but the portions aren't too big so definitely order a few dishes. Someone from the kitchen comes and explains everything about the dish which is cool. The managing partner, who might or might not be the owner is very kind and hands on. (I.e. host, behind the bar, bringing dishes, chatting with customers,etc.) Unique dishes and flavors. Wasn't able to try a few dishes which I wished to due then having pork which I don't eat but would've loved to."}
{"text":"Food was great but portions were really small considering the price and pictures on Toronto Life.  The Lotus root and watermelon appetizers are musts. Quaint little place.  First server was cold and standoffish but thankfully a different one served us for the rest of the night. Lots of servers going around looking busy but it took awhile until we were served."}
{"text":"Why had I not visited this restaurant before? What was wrong with me?  These were the thoughts going through my head as I experienced a fantastic meal here. Everything from the food, to the service, to the physical space was incredible.   The chef's tasting is worth every penny. The aumse bouche still lingers in my food memory - shrimp toast with foie gras and persimmon...perfection. The carpaccio was one of the best things I have ever tasted, and the pumpkin and butternut squash dumplings with the white rabbit candy was so damn original. I kept going back to get the sauce. And there was just so much more food!   Our server was incredibly knowledgeable about the food and attentive.  My boyfriend who can be picky and slightly unadventurous ate absolutely everything we were served. When he said he would be back I knew we found a winner."}
{"text":"Had the chance to try the tasting menu on Sunday, and it did not disappoint!  Everything was nicely portioned and served beautifully. We got to try majority of the menu, along with all the specials of the night.   Started with fried watermelon (not bad), octopus tacos (delicious), pumpkin dumplings (nothing special), Hakka brown wontons (good), and beef carpaccio (delicious!). There was also a kale salad with a perfectly cooked sous vide egg (pretty good) a betel leaf with pomelo (alright) seated napa cabbage (meh), and fried rice (yum). Finally, the specials made it to the table, a perfectly cooked beef with black bean sauce, and fall off the bone perfectly flavoured ribs.   The tasting menu is expensive, but they make it worth it. Highly recommend for a special occasion!"}
{"text":"My experience here was a bit disappointing re: portion size. We ordered about 6 items to share and none of us were able to leave truly satisfied. Perhaps it's the neighbourhood, and more money is expected to be dropped here in order for us to feel full. Food and service though was pretty good. There was a moment though where a newer waitress seemed to have done something wrong and the seasoned waiter tried to correct her, didnt want to make it apparent, but it was still apparent because he hissed at her and looked super annoyed. Not sure if that was the best way to handle a super minor slip up in front of guests. May have been more professional to let it go and speak with her outside of our vision.  In terms of food, it was good but nothing truly exceptional. Perhaps I was just disappointed cause the big mac bao which I came here for wasn't on the menu at the time of my visit. For the items that I did order, none of the flavours were outstanding to the point where I felt compelled to comeback. Would be good place for late night snacks and a few drinks though. As for dinner, sure, if you feel like dropping a few extra bucks. However, I do feel that I can find somewhere better for the price though. Overall, good experience but will unlikely return."}
{"text":"We went with 8 people for a friend's birthday this weekend and proceeded to have one of the better meals ever. I want to start off by saying that we were blown away by the service: we had the family style menu which I thought would be impossible due to our hilariously large list of allergies and dietary restrictions. Right away our server came to say that he and the chef were excited to serve us and had spent 20 minutes going over their menu to decide what to serve.  The food was phenomenal. Things started out with with 2 amuse bouches: one fish ribs and the other a delicious smoked trout in a betel leaf. Next up was the best dressed beef carpaccio ever and a battered and fried watermelon dish that transformed the fruit in a way I didn't know was possible.  We had many other dishes, and just when we thought we were done, out came huge wine-barrel platters of steak and fried trout. Just like the rest of the meal, both were perfect.  I can't recommend this place highly enough. If you're looking for a new place to try or a perfect place for a group, book Dailo!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!! One of the best Asian fusion restaurants out there.  Food--Ordered the Chef's tasting menu..and this was the best decision ever! At $55 pp it more than comfortably served our group of 7. There were 7 \"courses\" which consisted of a variety of small dishes/platters to share, some taken from the menu and some that were special off-menu items. The octopus tacos, fried rice and rainbow trout were to die for. Super worth it.  Atmosphere--Very trendy, modern vibe with traces of traditional Chinese decor. Great for intimate dining.   Service--Wonderful from start to finish. I must have called several times to change our reservation numbers but they were very accommodating about it. All the staff were super friendly and knowledgeable about the menu, and each dish was presented with pride and flare."}
{"text":"I took my 80 year old mother who was visiting from Nova Scotia to Dailo last night and it was fantastic.  I was a little nervous taking her there, but she absolutely loved it as much as I did. 4/5 dishes we ordered were fantastic, and the 5th was simply really really good, just not quite as exceptional as the other 4 and perhaps that was just because it was much more subtle. The 4 exceptional dishes included the pumpkin ravioli (my mother hasn't stopped talking about them all day), the fried watermelon, the lamb and the truffle rice.  I would have ordered differently - more spicy dishes - had I been there without an 80 year old but I'm not complaining. The servers were outstanding.  They explained everything in depth, managed my mother's fear of food she didn't understand, were very very attentive, kind and charming.  5 stars all the way. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Food super good the first time but a lot of things are deep fried."}
{"text":"Had really low expectations.  Some of my most trusted restaurant-savvy friends had given this place thumbs down, so I was still curious but also a bit nervous.    We first attempted, and succeeded, at getting inside Bar Raval (to put this in perspective: it was a Saturday night at the peak popular dining hour, and everything on this strip was dead. Everyone in the city has gotten the hell outta dodge).  We had asked to take the empty two top on their patio, but the Bar Raval host dude told us he can only have 8 people on the patio, and he already had 7.  So we went inside, where we were met with extreme heat, and the prospect of standing and getting pushed the whole time.   Time to switch it up!  DaiLo, on the other hand, had a free deuce on the patio and they actually let us sit there.  Lovely patio, great for people watching, and quiet.  I had already decided to stay clear of the cocktails, which I had heard were weak, and stick with Izumi Sake, which is a huge favourite of mine.  Happy to see it on the menu, it pairs so well with Asian flavours and is a nice alternative to grape wine.    We sort of free-style ordered, each of us picking dishes we might like - I wanted the shrimp dish, the jellyfish slaw; he wanted the wontons and the fried rice.  The first two dishes weren't outstanding (fried watermelon is worth an order just for curiosity sake; the beef tendon special was boring), but the jellyfish slaw and the wontons were really good.  Definitely get the slaw; we liked it so much we ordered another bowl!  The fried rice was great, and the shrimp dish (it was shrimp on a pancake with lettuce on the side to make a ssam style wrap) was great.  I saw another table getting the Big Mac baos I'd heard about, so I asked and she said sometimes they serve it downstairs not just at Lo Pan (not sure if that's true or they were VIPs but she did let us order one).  It tasted EXACTLY like a Big Mac.    Service was friendly, efficient, informative.  Bathrooms were clean and nice, always a plus in my books.  I am not sure if it was just that my expectations were low, that comparative to Bar Raval this place was friendly and appealing or if I just got lucky, but I'd definitely go back to DaiLo for a night out."}
{"text":"Fresh off the train from Montreal, my cuz scooped me up and we went straight to this spot. It's a medium-sized Asian fusion joint with a nice ambience. After agonizing over what to order, we decided to each get a chef's choice(?), which was great from a taste perspective but challenging from a stomach space perspective. What was also a little confusing was that we thought we only ordered one, but I guess they charged us for two(?). Anyways, my cuz is doing much better in life than me so she treated :)   Okay, so here were the highlights: the fried watermelon (surprisingly good), the octopus pork belly tacos (I wanted more), the pumpkin dumplings (OMG), the lamb neck (delectable). There were also other dishes in between and they all were solid. There was a pork face sisig plate that I wasn't too impressed with (doing too much), but it wasn't horrible. It was A LOT of food, which you don't expect from such a place. We also had a couple cocktails as well as some champorrado for dessert (amazing!). Overall a tasty and gluttonous experience. Might order a la cartel next time lol."}
{"text":"Fantastic place, great atmosphere. The crispy octopus taco and Hakka dumplings were our favourites."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE! Went with a bunch of girlfriend and we let the chef feed us. Food was super creative, very interesting flavour combos and we were STUFFED. The service was excellent (bar one waiter who need to speak a tad louder) and the decor is hip. The hype is real. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"After a couple of years I found myself downstairs at DaiLo.    It's a great bet for a lively catchup between a couple of people or for a small group with a nice backdrop of interesting cocktails and share plates.   These dishes are much better than what I had tried off of the menu upstairs; a couple of them are downright memorable.   I stand by my good service assessment.   Highlights:  My standout dish: Torched Tamari Glazed Beef Carpaccio (90 day olliffe's rib cap, herb salad, nuoc mam, prawn cracker). OH YEAH!  For a decadent treat try the pumpkin dumplings ( soy brown butter sauce, Black truffles, \"white rabbit candy\" glaze, pepita crumble)."}
{"text":"Came here with bunch of friends.  Ordered a couple starters.  Ordered the watermelon.  Not blown away...couldve done without.  The carpaccio was delicious but too little. Wontons were okay.. Overall paid a lot for not a lot of food.  Ended up leaving and eating ramen because we didn't think the price was worth the food.  Expected a lot.. Left disappointed"}
{"text":"My friends have warned me about this place. But despite their warning I still went with a couple of friends from NY. I give it 1 stars because the service was great and attentive. Most dishes tasted like it was made by different people and then plated together without a discussion. The pairings of flavour were some of the strangest I have ever seen. It's all Asian ingredients that's the only common thread, but most ingredients were things that should not go together. I didn't like the Big Mac Bao, the meat was watery and grey because it's steamed, mixed with Big Mac sauce it's just a disaster. Fried watermelon was ok but pork floss was just straight out the jar then topped with some raw bean sprouts. Not worth the money. It was pricey and we left hungry. If you want real Asian food go to Chinatown or Markham, there are also lots more well executed Fusion Cuisine in Toronto. The decor is really nice but that's not hard to achieve because it is just an exact carbon copy of Bao Bei Restaurant in Vancouver."}
{"text":"First off, I want to say that I came in to this place with very high expectations. As you can see from the number of stars I gave this place, that these expectations were met! Second, the type of cuisine is labelled as Chinese, but I found it to be a great mix of Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai, among other Asian cuisines.  A group of 6 of us had the chef's course and every dish that came out was amazing.  Some of the noteworthy dishes: Fried watermelon - I loved the way this dish came together.  The sweet watermelon went perfectly with the fish sauce and bean sprouts. Celtuce salad with anchovies - The anchovies make this dish! If you don't like anchovies, you might not enjoy this salad, but even if you're neutral about anchovies, they really bring out the flavor of this dish. Smoked trout on betel leaf - so many different flavors going on at once, but working so perfectly together. Egg net salad - Very tasty salad. Reminds me of Thai papaya salads. The egg net didn't add too much flavor-wise, but it was very aesthetically pleasing. Sweet and sour pork hock - My absolute favorite dish of the night. The sauce was phenomenal and the pork was cooked perfect. Grilled Lamb Neck - Very tender and the meat literally falls off the bone. It was meant to be eaten with chive pancakes and hoisin sauce a la Peking duck style. But, I found the chive pancakes didn't add much, nor did it really complement the flavors of the lamb.  The addition of the hoisin sauce was also overwhelming, even when only a little was added. Fried Giggie Trout - This came with 3 different sauces. The trout by itself was delicious but the sauces really seal the deal.  The green curry aioli was my personal favorite, an opinion shared by the other 5 people with me.  Every dish here was unique and delicious.  When I ever return to Toronto, I will make sure to make a stop here!"}
{"text":"Food was very flavorful! My favorite was the fried rice with xo sauce, I could not stop eating it!. The lamb was very good as well. I tried the wontons because there were so many good reviews on them, they were good, but not outstandingly memorable, but still good. We had the empanada which was good as well, but once again, not outstandingly memorable. We were eating with a person that does not eat pork so we ordered the silken tofu as well which I thought was okay (I'm not a huge tofu fan so not the restaurant's fault)  Yes, I would definitely come back, I would like to eventually try everything on their ever changing menu!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try DaiLo as it's new in Toronto and I have heard great things. I wasn't dissapointed, but I wasn't left wanting to come back.  I had the black bean brussel sprouts, octopus fresh rolls, and curried cauliflower.  The brussel sprouts were salty in an incredible kind of way, fried and just yummy! Liked this as a side.   The fresh rolls (I had them without pork), were TO DIE FOR! Delicious two bites. Try this for sure!  The cauliflower, while it was tasty, was missing something for me. It didn't leave me craving it and it felt a bit like filler. I almost was hoping for a roasted or fried cauliflowers (similar to the brussel sprouts) sitting on the curry sauce. The flavours all worked well, I just wanted it to explode a bit more in my mouth. It really lacked depth and for $18 was not worth it.   Our server was really nice and I liked her a lot. The only issue I have is that I wanted to be made to feel a bit special. I know that sounds silly, but in a restaurant, if I'm made to feel overly comfortable, welcome and that the team in the restaurant is willing to do whatever it takes, I end up staying longer and spending more money on drinks. In this case, I was ready to go after a few dishes.   SO... This is a new restaurant. I think they can do better, but what I had was delicious and I think they WILL do better. I would go back in a few months, once things have settled in and I would most definitely suggest going in to give them a try for yourself.   Overall, a nice evening."}
{"text":"Really amazing food (if you eat pork).  We sat at the bar and it was a good vibe from start to finish. The bartender chatted with us while she made amazing looking (overpriced) cocktails. Food was to die for and portion size was half-decent!"}
{"text":"My first visit here years ago was an absolute 5/5 experience.   But this time around it was not as good as I remembered it.   The portion sizes felt smaller, the prices higher and the taste was missing that wow factor it had on my first visit.   There is so much innovation here, the service is great and the cocktails are awesome.   Still will find it hard to recommend at these prices."}
{"text":"So happy to hear DaiLo got the number 4 spot on Toronto Life's best new restaurant 2015!  I loved the food too!  The hole deconstructed Trout with 3 sauces and the Truffled Rice was to die for!!!  I am going back to celebrate my Birthday/April 15th! With so many great places to dine, I usually don't often go to the same place twice.  DaiLo has made my list!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I never write reviews and this is my 3rd time at dailo, previously very satisfied! Ordered the chefs menu and was profoundly disappointed! Courses included vichychoisse and at least 2 pickled ginger vegetable medley wrapped in leaves. No red meat, when tables on either side of us that ordered chefs menus were served ribeyes. Dailo was one of the rare restos that I was returning to, but this will be the last time."}
{"text":"The Rainbow Trout was fried, separated from the bone, and placed on a long elevated board on our table.  It was a fantastic presentation!  There were a lot of boneless fish segments that I absolutely LOVED.  I've never had fried fish that was so well done.  It wasn't too fried with any batter left on the fish at all and yet the meat inside was firm and tasty.  Amazing!  It also came with three types of sauces:  green curry Aioli, Vietnamese nahm jim, and soy glaze.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a new experience last night at DaiLo. Went with another couple and tried out the Chef's choice which is $55 per person (I believe the price has now gone up to $65 pp). Which is fairly pricey, but it's so worth it. The service is impeccable. The staff are so friendly and helpful. My partner has an allergy to crustaceans and the chef took that into account and created separate dishes for him.  We had the Octopus tacos, Fried Watermelon, Pumpkin Dumplings, Hakka Wontons, Singapore Curry Cauliflower, Truffle Fried Brown Rice, Bulgogi Glazed Lamb Neck and the Jellyfish Slaw. I may have forgotten some of the dishes (oops!). It was one of the few times I didn't take pictures of a meal, despite the excellent presentation of food -- I WAS BEING PRESENT!  Some of the food was much better than other dishes, but overall it was a hit. Our dining companions have been to DaiLo before and done the Chef's menu before as well. They love this place, and I can see why. The drinks are spot on too! I do think that $65 is a bit steep. But if you've got money to blow, and want a new experience, definitely check this place out. You get to taste a big chunk of the menu with the Chef's menu, which is a very nice way to explore the brand."}
{"text":"One of the best Asian fusion restaurants in Toronto. I have always been skeptical of Asian fusion. It is either done really well or really poorly.  This is why I am happy to report that DaiLo's fusion cuisine is done really well. The food was creative and inspired and prepared with finesse.   We visited this restaurant as a group and decided to do a chef tasting menu. This is a great way to truly sample the various dishes at DaiLo. While all of the dishes were excellent, there were a few highlights, amongst them are: (1) the \"Big Mac\" bao, (2) the whole fried trout, and (3) beef plate.  The dishes were well presented, flavourful and fresh.   I would highly recommend this gem on College St."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and the service was professional but unpretentious. Everything was well executed. Many people seem to be concerned about the price but we got the chef's menu and it was excellent. Multiple courses and we did not leave hungry or overstuffed. The tacos are an absolute must!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was voted one of the top 10 restaurants on Huntington post. I never heard about this restaurant before but Chinese and French fusion sounded very interesting so we decided to have our New Years party here with some of our friends.   We decided to go with chef pick to try a little bit of everything.   For $50/person, we received 13 amazing dishes and we were all fully stuffed. The food was all very well seasoned and the ingredients were all very fresh and interesting. We were all in heaven trying these dishes and we are definitely coming back.    Some of our favourites were  1) 90 day dry ribeye 2) fried watermelon 3) deep fried shrimps  4) sweet and sour pork belly  5) truffle fried rice  And so on  There wasn't even one bad dish. Everything was so good. We are definitely coming back :)"}
{"text":"I recently had the opportunity to hop in to DaiLo on their opening day and try Nick Liu's latest creations (#sickasianfood). The restaurant is very unique, walking in transports you to the 20's, cut with modern design and touches of chinoiserie. From the gold on red details on the maître d's stand, to the dragon stencils on the lanterns, gold framed black and white photos, and traditional decorative fine China, the restaurant carries out their theme precisely and fully- setting it apart with the finer details often overlooked by others.  The teal seats, espresso wood flooring, tables, stools and intricate screen dividers for the booths are the modern sophisticated touches to remind us that, yes this is 2014 and no, we're not in a Chinese restaurant in Chinatown. It's going to be higher quality, more inventive Asian flavors done with French technique, balancing casual to fine dining all in one.  Could the bar be any cooler as well? The skylight was perfectly situated above the bar, allowing the natural sunlight to pour in and on to the drinks.  Although the overall feel of the restaurant is casual, it's definitely a bit classier at the same time. The service was a clear indication, with attentive and knowledgeable servers that knew what they were doing and what they were serving.  The menus were small and divided into 3 main sections, single plates ranging from $4-$5, small plates from $9-$13, and large plates from $20+. I decided to try a variety of Chef Nick's 'New Asian Cuisine' despite my already full stomach.  I ordered: Roast Duck and Scallion Taco Mini two-bite tacos with traditional Chinese roast duck flavours. Textures were great, the duck came through most, while the refreshing cucumber, scallions, and cilantro completed the classic Peking duck experience. The sweet sauce finished the dish well.  Big Mac Bao I like to call this the \"OMG part 1\" of the night. Tastes just like a Big Mac! The sauce is two thirds of the experience, tangy and cheesy, while the Bao and lettuce lend the textures we are so fond of.   Smoked Trout Betal Leaf Never had Betal leaves before (never knew they were edible either), but the herbaceous leaf worked well with the smooth, pate-like smoked tuna.  Beef Tartare \"Kare Kare\" This is the best beef tartare I've ever had. The consistency was silky, minimal metallic flavor so what you're left with is good quality tartare that's slightly acidic from the eggplant puree and pickled peanuts with the added crunch from the crispy pork skin  Crispy Octopus Fresh Roll The best thing I had here, hands down, and probably the best two bites I've eaten in a while. The wrap is a slice of sweet daikon, accompanied by super tender octopus and pork with a light crisp coating.  Tom Yum Booze Reminiscent of a mojito with a definite kick from the chili. Utterly refreshing with a very pleasant sour hint at the very end of each sip.  Dinner isn't complete without a 'reverse' red envelope. This one where you pay your bill, not the other way around.  Overall I was very pleased with my visit to DaiLo. Was it worth the wait? Yes, very much so. The food was inventive and tasty. The space was imaginative and comfortable for both dinner and drinks. The service was attentive and kind, while the atmosphere suited me just fine. I look forward to my next visit here, but until then, I'll see if I can eat a Big Mac without thinking about it's stubbier Asian cousin."}
{"text":"I came here because of excellent reviews on yelp and other websites. However, I didn't think the food was that excellent overall. There was some hits and some misses.   Hits:  -Good ambience and decor -Good service -The octopus fresh roll which had a delicious and unique flavour -The truffle fried rice - you could really taste the truffle undertones and the made in house sauce that came with it was delicious.  Misses: -the hakka brown wontons were good but very standard, tasted like something you could get at any place in China Town. -whole fried giggie trout - the fish was tender on the inside and crispy on the outside, so it was well made, but unfortunately it was quite tasteless.  We also had the Argentinian red shrimp which falls in between hit and miss because the flavour was good but it was a strange experience to have the whole shrimp to eat. I am not quite that adventurous!  Overall I would only come again to have the \"hit\" dishes, but I expected more from this highly rated restaurant."}
{"text":"Food: The food was good. The dishes I would recommend are the octopus tacos and the hakka wontons.  Drinks: This was my favourite part! I will probably come here for the drinks alone. I had the Tom Yum inspired cocktail (2 glasses of it). My friend had the one that came in the Tiki glass which I think was the Mai Tai. The drinks were definitely creative and delicious  Service: Our server was great and really knowledgeable and patient to help us decide on the dishes.   Atmosphere: Without sounding overly old I would say that the music and overall noise level in the restaurant was on the loud side. I only say that because I was there with a few friends and we had to talk loudly to carry on our conversation"}
{"text":"You know it's going to be a long meal when they set you up with complementary sparkling water. There's a lot of detail that goes into these creative and unique dishes - and that takes time. All the dishes boomed with flavour. We left filled but not full - very satisfying.   The service is great, as they're all friendly and Nick was open to telling his story of how Dai Lo came to be. They were attentive to how the table looked and when the plates needed to be replaced with new ones.   Of course, everyone knows that this little block on College has a lot of expectations to uphold, and they did not disappoint.   If you ask, they might be able to order you the Big Mac Bao from their upstairs snack menu (Lo Pan). It's worth a try!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  excellent food, BEAUTIFUL decor and upstairs has a cool snack menu that i'm obsessed with.  Chef Nick Liu is always coming out with really interesting inventive new dishes."}
{"text":"Dai Lo is very accommodating and service was lovely. Server knew everything and explained the menu items. Even let us order some bar menu when we were dining in the patio.  They have a dinner menu downstairs and a bar menu upstairs.  Ordered the Truffle Fried Rice, Char Siu Pork Loin,Jellyfish Slaw, Hakka Brown Wontons, big mac baos for a table of two. Needless to say, we were stuffed!  notables: the Char Siu came in huge slices and the sauce was perfection but the bao was sticking to our teeth like crazy. The jelly slaw was refreshing as the vegetables added a nice crunch to it."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant I've ever eaten at hands down. Try EVERYTHING. But really / the chefs selection is what you will want from LIFE. Go and explore this Thai fusion brilliance and thank GOD that you're alive because your tastebuds will never be the same again. hit up the TOM YUM BOOZE and don't look back. Bring along a dope friend or a significant other who's ready to get into some delicious, detail driven tasty food and you're golden pony boy. (The secret is in the fish heads)"}
{"text":"Overall very impressed with Dailo! Last night my boyfriend and I had 'Dailo's Choice', for $50 a person we had the chef select our meal. I was skeptical at first but I wouldn't of done it any different! We had about 7 smaller plates and the full fried trout for the grand finale (full head and all!). I must say, you might need to be a little on the adventurous side to try everything that was selected. Example: sturgeon tripe (amazing, reminded me of octopus), cuttle fish green curry (fantastic flavour- sweet and spicy), 90 day aged beef carpaccio (favorite dish).. However, the variety of dishes and getting to try so many new things was great for us! Also, don't forget to check  out 'Lo Pan', the cocktail bar upstairs."}
{"text":"It's hard to get in here without a reservation far in advance and for good reason. I came here for a friends birthday where we had the tasting menu at $55 per person. Me and my boyfriend have been to a lot of Toronto's popular restaurants but it's been a while since one actually blew us away with every dish. Especially with new asian restaurants their food was nothing special but with a big shiny price tag at smaller portions- but Dai Lo was not one of these.The food had a familiar feeling but was also extremely inventive; the tasting menu was very generous and filling. They made sharing multiple plates easy and most importantly everything tasted amazing. The staff are also very friendly and informative. We'll all be frequenting this spot as much as possible!"}
{"text":"and.. nope  as much as I liked seeing creative decorated fusion chinese food.. this was not it. They tried to tailor to the local crowd.. but the flavors were not authentic. a lot of just.. soy sauce and satay sauce, and... why didn't i just walk a block away to go to chinatown? chinese donut dipped in mussel juice is not exciting me at all.   Cute decor, attentive staff, over priced, and food was very.. meh.   ordered 3 dishes, not memorable. wont' come again, this was NOT the type of chinese food i signed up for. walk a block east and north, lots of fabulous chinese flavors awaits."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best restaurants in Toronto right now.  Oh, Dailo. So totally delicious. The decor, so funky, so beautiful.  Enter and there's a stairwell to an upstairs bar that looks like you're walking up tl a spaceship... sick first impression.   Service was awesome. Server bearded man loved the food, new the menu cold, was helping us figure out what we wanted, killer suggestions, watched our table and took care of what came our way -- truly good service.  The way he described the food also really reflected how much the Chef and the kitchen staff invest into ingredients, flavor, and taste.  It's not just a list of items on this menu.   The food... This morning I wished I didn't brush my teeth because I wanted to still taste what I had.  So goddamm good.    1. Drinks: Tom Yum Booze - spicy, light, coconut water, spicy, light, coconut water.  Drink, repeat. It's like you just hit that combination over and over.  Not super boozy, spicy, a bit biting, refreshing.  2. Plates: Octopus tacos - beats out anything from Grand Electric, La Carnita, whatever. On a jicama shell which made it into this unique tortilla, and the fried octopus, and aioli, and pork belly ... delicious.  Pumpkin dumplings  - total knockout, and was like my first taste of love for Dailo.  The dumplings are good, really good, but the sauce?  Butter, truffle oil, soy, white rabbit candy glaze (wha?). You just think about what brown butter and truffle oil must taste like and you can imagine how good that must be. I was drinking this with a spoon. Forget the dumplings ... just the sauce.  Halloumi - probably the weakest thing we ordered but still very good.  Got this with the tofu, and the black bean sauce is salty, different, with these pieces of tofu that give a nice chew.  It's very good, but the black bean sauce is just a bit overpowering for the rest of the flavors.  All very relative to everything else we had that night, of course... Singapore Curry Cauliflower - this is where you see the asian coming out.    3. Mains: I swear these two dishes made Dailo one of the most memorable dinners I've had in months. We got this tip from our server to get the cabbage with a remoullade of a cheese, in a sauce, along with the 90 day aged 12oz rib eye.  Seriously no words.  It's an expensive item ($44 for the rib eye) but the beef ... that beef ... Thd word \"succulent\" is made for moments like this.  The rib eye had a green chutney aioli drizzled on top, these pickled mushrooms, this bok chop, the steak was seared on the outside, totally breaking apart in your mouth.  Then you take the cabbage remoullade and put it on top... and it's like all three of us at the table were falling out of our booth. One of the best dishes I might have ever had.  Memorable would be an understatement.    Just loved this place and for a restaurant that's apparently \"new,\" you wouldn't know it.  Dailo has got to be one of my favorite restaurants of the year.  Understated, the food is truly perfection, service just exudes a respect and love for that menu, and it's worth the experience.  Delicious spot.  Maybe one of Toronto's best right now?"}
{"text":"This is likely the best meal I've had in Toronto. Surely in the top 3.  If you're debating going, stop debating. Just go. It's phenomenal. Get the chef's choice. I didn't even look at the menu and it was the best idea. Every single dish was a masterpiece. All of them. So I'm not going to recommend a specific dish, just put your trust in the chef's choice and prepare to have your head blown off.   If you've travelled around Asia, you'll especially love dailo. So many flavours from all over Asia throughout the meal. It was like taking a trip through my favourite Asian memories, with a bit of Ontario blended in.   I was entertaining a business colleague from Shanghai, China on his first trip to Canada and even he was blown away. And that says a lot, because he's a big foodie back home. This was a tribute to Asian food that even surprised him. He loved it. I loved it. You'll love it.   11/10"}
{"text":"I wasn't the biggest fan of this place despite the great reviews on yelp. The menu was definitely elevated Asian with upscale ingredients. We had the Singapore Curry Cauliflower, Truffle Fried Rice, Ponzu Beef Carpaccio. The carpaccio was my favourite part of the meal. It had a great balance of flavours. It was very savoury, but the sauce and herbs gave it a lot of freshness as well. The other dishes were good but there was nothing special about them. The flavours and execution of the dishes did not justify the prices they were charging.  Big Mac Bao was good but not great. Everything I ate here was kind of average.   The atmosphere of the place was excellent and the wait staff were super friendly. I think the food was a bit of a let down for me. I would like to try some of the other stuff on the menu. The trout in particular looked delicious"}
{"text":"Pumpkin dumplings were AMAZING. 5 stars for that Also ordered Ma Po Haloumi - was very good. An interesting take on the classic ma po tofu mixed with a tofu with black bean sauce. Just the right about of spice and acidity. 4 stars Cauliflower curry was meh. Sauce has good flavor but not enough of it to compensate for chunky cauliflower pieces. 3 stars. They are willing to adjust dishes to dietary restrictions. Service also very good, but not spectacular. Good for this type of restaurant. Wine selection pretty good but not spectacular.  Overall great restaurant if you order the right things"}
{"text":"I love the decor - very beautiful restaurant, and the food is great. My favorite is the duck taco."}
{"text":"I'm going to be short and sweet with this review and just say that I've been to DaiLo more times since it opened than I've been to all other restaurants combined--probably only a slight exaggeration.  The pork hocks are a must-get.  I love their slaw-type salads: they are fresh, fragrant, and crisp--this is probably the only restaurant where I order salads. The lamb neck is awesome.  (Dear DaiLo: please keep it on the menu forever!--unless you switch it with a lamb shoulder or something.  ;)) Even as a non-fish-eater, I will still say that their whole fried trout is worth getting at least once. And even as an anti-sugar-Nazi, I find they often have interesting and experimental desserts that are worth trying a bite or two.   Service is excellent, every time."}
{"text":"Awesome Chinese/Asian new fusion cuisine. Food was great. The pork baos are fantastic and the cocktails were delicious. I always try to make it here when I'm visiting. Great service and vibrant crowd. Came here with a luggage and they were gracious enough to stow it for me without issue. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"DaiLo's servers are very informative/professional and the food comes out fast which I'm not used to (it usually takes forever to even get a glass of water sometimes at other establishments..) We ordered the crispy octopus taco, pumpkin dumplings and Sichuan braised beef for 2 people. I really enjoyed the pumpkin dumpling a lot! Creamy with a savory yet not too heavy butter sauce with thinly sliced truffles on top. The octopus taco was interesting with it being wrapped with jicama, refreshing for an appetizer but the main Sichuan braised beef was 'ok'. I guess that's what you get with fusion food, some are a hit and some are a miss. The price was a tad bit steep too for the amount of food and flavour though but I enjoyed the dining experience + complimentary sparkling water! Oh, how I loveee sparkling water!"}
{"text":"3.5 for sure on this new addition to my favourite College St strip.   We walked in on a Sat with no reservation. The place was busy, though nothing like the wild lines and wait next door. We cozied up to the bar. Great bartender, awesome cocktails. The place is slinky and sexy and not too kitchy in its nod to modern China.   I found it really refreshing and very Hong Kong meets NYC.   We tried a number of items off the menu. All were tasty, though some extra small in portion and others a bit too sweet. Highlights were the truffle fried rice and the fried watermelon.  But generally if you share you are sure to get a good mix of flavours and leave with a happy belly.   Great new spot and sure to continue to generate buzz as people in the city explore Chinese flavours away from the hubs on Spadina and in he burbs."}
{"text":"First rate meal, marred only by the din of shouting diners. Terrific fried watermelon, pumpkin dumplings, quail. A very good waiter and a pretty reasonable tab."}
{"text":"This is a review for LoPan, the cocktail lounge above DaiLo.  They have a selection of super-unique cocktails that I was glad I tried. The bartender who was working, Turry, was extremely knowledgeable and friendly. He immediately struck up an awesome conversation for me and my friend, and did a great job of making our drinks.  Also, the interior decor in the bar is AMAZING. There are so many cool little intricacies everywhere; my friend and I could not stop raving about it for the whole night.  Definitely try this place. It's worth the experience for sure."}
{"text":"/BOTTOM LINE:  Chinese \"fusion\" done right. A great place to come if you want elevated Chinese classics, a cool space, and yummy cocktails.  /THE SPACE: Beautiful! There are lovely murals along the wall. One side of the restaurant is tables and the other side houses \"booths\". Bar in the back.   /THE FOOD: I loved every bite of it. We ordered 6 dishes + dessert for two people, and we were more than full. Our waitress was thoughtful with letting us know how many dishes we should order, which was refreshing since I feel like I get \"upsold\" a lot and end up ordering too much food.  - Fried winter melon with pork belly: So delicious, and reminded me of my childhood the minute I bit into it, as my weekday dinners were often winter melon soup.  - Pumpkin dumplings - Very much like a wonton, but with creamy pumpkin inside and a sweet glaze (white rabbit candy!) - Truffle fried rice - $20+ fried rice should be delicious and Dailo delivered. Hints of (But not overdone) truffle, crunchy rice bits, and the homemade XO sauce were key. - General Tso sweetbreads - A refreshing take on a classic takeout dish. The sauce was a little salty, but I think it's just staying true to what general tso's chicken always is.  Two specials: - Yu choy with fried garlic scapes/kimchi butter -- yummy, but kind of oily. The fried stuff was covered in tempura batter, which was great. - Singaporean oyster omelet - I love how the specials reflect the chef's recent travels. Amped up take on singaporean omelet with FRIED OYSTERS (?!?) on top.   Overall, a fantastic restaurant. We had a lot of Chinese food while visiting Toronto but this stood out from the rest. Can't wait to come back here."}
{"text":"Nice & casual. Patio & bar seating available. Chose the tasting menu. Everything from start to finish was a great experience. Their crispy octopus tacos are amazing. I'd go back again and again just for that. Shrimp & pork wontons were bomb. The fried dough fritter roll with fresco cheese and cherry tomatoes was an awesome surprise. Fried pork belly was next level. Nice crunch and super tender juicy at the same time *drool*  Whole fried trout was a little intimidating but totally worth getting your hands a little messy. It ended with a sake sorbet with candied ginger atop. A refreshing palate cleanser. Service was also top notch."}
{"text":"Amazing experience. Put this in your bookmarks immediately.   Signature cocktails? Check Shareable plates? Check Impressive culinary aesthetic & gastronomy? Double check Sophisticated decor, chill crowd and sexy ambiance? YASS  Five star service? Check and add some personality and flair in there and you've got this lovely boutique asian-fusion bar lounge called Dailo.   I may have arrived here on a whim but I plan on returning again very soon. I'd say this is a must-visit for anyone looking to have a unique and modern gourmet dining experience in Toronto. Make a reservation (very necessary), eat some good food, impress your friends/dates with your good taste and pick up a few cool points - seems like a win-win to me!  P.S. I recommend the pumpkin dumplings, the fried watermelon, the Markham sour, and the Amaro Nonino liquer with your dessert.   P.P.S. Trevor is my everything."}
{"text":"What a gem! My husband and I came here last minute as we were walking to the Mexican place next door, but the food caught our eyes so we did a detour to DaiLo. Not knowing the reviews or the fact that it is rated one of the best restaurants in Canada, we tried the food and was floored by the different flavours Chef was able to incorporate into his dishes. I wouldn't say I have any specific recommendations for dishes as they were ALL excellent! Amazing and will be back!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing!!! We will definitely be coming back for the food, every bite was memorable! The only bad thing about this place was our particular server, if you don't want to be there and be asked questions you really shouldn't be!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Great service, food and cocktails, what more can you ask for? However, don't expect huge portions. This is a small tapas/sharing plates kind of place. Awesome atmosphere as well!"}
{"text":"Tried the chef's menu - the first sorbet was delicious, and there were a couple good dishes as well but overall all the food was deep-fried or used the fattiest part of the meat. An entire menu was very greasy and the oil/fat was staying in my mouth a whole time as deep-fried/high fat parade of the course comes to your table. The idea of the asian fusion food is unique but it's over priced (+$70 after tax and tip per person without any drinks) for the quality of the food. They use a lot of truffle oil but it's not classy to use it in almost every dishes.. Customer service was fine but not excellent for the price you pay."}
{"text":"***this is actually a review for LoPan, the upstairs cocktail bar***  I went here on a Friday for a friend's surprise birthday and we couldn't have asked for a better experience. Not only had they sectioned off a nice large portion for our group, but the servers were totally ready for us, armed with fast, friendly service and great attitudes. It was a fantastic location for a surprise party. While my friend and his girlfriend ate dinner downstairs at DaiLo (which they said was phenomenal, by the way), the rest of us snuck in through the side door and headed upstairs.   I was immediately struck by the interesting decor, especially the cages that hung from the ceiling above us. The ambience was really awesome, it was dark inside with intimate and eclectic lighting.    The drinks were also great! I didn't try any of the fancy cocktails myself, but those who did really liked them. A friend of mine ordered the truffle infused fried rice and it smelled so good I had to have a bite. It was actually the best fried rice I ever had, which says something considering no word of a lie I had chinese food almost every day last week so I should have been sick of fried rice, not planning a return visit just so I could order my own.   I definitely have to go back to try Dailo's full menu offerings! If it's anything like the truffle-infused fried rice, I will be a lifelong fan."}
{"text":"Second time here and I loved it more the first. The reservation was at 5:30pm when they open so the hostess came out at 5:28 to tell they open at 5:30. Imagine being late for your reservation but you can't come in2 minutes early in the cold. Very unfriendly and baffling. Restaurants should be prepared at 5:25 for 5:30. Regardless our waitress was wonderful and the food good although the cauliflower lacked flavor. Here I want things I can't make myself. The best is the pumpkin dumplings."}
{"text":"Came here last night with two friends who decided to treat me to dinner. In the spirit of festivities I also ended up doing the ordering: yu choi and deep fried asparagus balls, mussels in a broth, rib eye with asian Chimichurri, fried trout, and truffle fried rice. Everything was bomb. Service was funny quick and helpful. Hostess actually met us outside the restaurant since we couldn't find the place.    Do not get the hakka dumplings. It's just not worth 8-9 bucks. Dessert was also weak.   Will go back! truffle rice. Rib eye. And trout are must haves"}
{"text":"One of the best meals I have ever had.  The truffle fried rice and pumpkin dumplings are not to be missed. Seriously - the pumpkin dumplings will blow your mind.   Service was great, the waiter even made us a special dessert drink at our request and it was amazing!    Wish I could eat this every day."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.. But it was just okay. 3/5 for food, -1 for the very high price point.  I usually loooove Asian fusion and the food here all looked so interesting! We got all the expensive stuff - truffle fried rice, duck, beef sashimi; all in all 6 items between 2 people. (The menu looked interesting enough we were willing to over order then take home)  And I have to say, each dish was just... Meh. It felt like they tried way too hard to mix a bunch of \"Asian\" ingredients in interesting ways, but it just didn't work. Flavors felt very messy.  They used a lot of green onions and sesame oil and soy sauce, throwing in \"asian\" stuff like steamed egg or Chinese doughnuts.   This might taste interesting / new to some people (not meant to be condescending!), but I know Asian cuisine very well and it just tasted like a mess to me; not bad, not great, mostly confusing and underwhelming.  Atmosphere was semi-fancy semi-bar like."}
{"text":"I came to Dailo with high expectations after hearing great things and I was sorely disappointed.   We got the chef choice tasting menu for $55 a person.  Service and attention to detail was lacking. We were missing small serving spoons on some condiments, one of our dishes came in a clearly chipped dish, and they missed cleaning our table between courses.  The tapas food was a mix of stars depending on the dish. We had: - Watermelon sorbet in sake- 4 stars - very refreshing - crispy octopus taco - 5 stars - fried watermelon - 3 stars - the pieces were too big making the watermelon overpowering  - Ontario pea dumplings - 4 stars- lovely truffle taste - egg net salad - 4 stars - refreshing and light - seared Napa cabbage - 2 stars - not enjoyable - seasonal sisig - 2 stars - just not wow - truffle fried rice - 3 stars  - seasonal quail - 1 star - this was the feature large dish and was the most disappointing. The seasoning had not penetrated into the meat so the quail tasted unsalted and bland. The seasonal vegetables around it did not bring additional flavour so the dish was unenjoyable and we ate only 1/3 of it. - desert sorbet - 4 stars - great way to end a meal.  With respect to the quail dish, they noted we did not eat it. We mentioned it wasn't a good dish and that we did not want to eat it or take it home and they moved on as though it was a normal occurrence.  Another strange experience was that for a $150 meal for 2 people they did not want to accept Amex. I get it for a grocery store but for this ticket price I expected they could cover the higher interchange fee.   Overall we came out disappointed with our experience and our meal."}
{"text":"Asian fusion isn't exactly my cup of tea, but I can't say enough good things about my food experience here at Dai Lo.  I came here with 3 other girlfriends on a Wednesday night; we couldn't make reservations because we were too last minute, and while walk-ins are welcome, the only spot we managed to get was on the patio (and quite possibly on the hottest day of the year!).  We interacted with a few waiters over the course of the night and I got to say everyone I met was a little be quirky in their own way. Nothing bad or negative, just interesting personalities.   Onto the real star of the show though, which was the food. It was an absolute delight dining here. I was very, very surprised by how tasty the food was, even for \"asian food\" (which I've already mentioned I\"m not that big of a fan of).  Some highlights: - crispy octopus tacos (5/5): phenomenal! wasn't expecting the jicama taco, but it gave such a good crunch and texture to the dish. the octopus was very tender. the dish came together with all of its flavours and texture very nicely - after our entire meal, i decided to order another serving of this to finish the meal.  - fried watermelon (4.5/5): this dish just sounds out of whack. having that said, i don't what it is about it, but the combination of flavours just worked. the watermelon had a little bit of a batter to it, and because it's fried, the inside was on the softer side (kind of like boiled wintermelon when it's in chinese soup, if you know what i mean...). pairing watermelon and pork floss and a hint of freshness from (what i believe to be) basil was just fantastic.  - ontario pea dumplings (3/5): this was recommended to us by our waiter. i didn't love this dish; i like my dumplings to have substance to it, but the pea filling is slightly on the softer side and same with the dumpling skin. i really liked the sauce though, and truffle is never a bad idea ;)  - truffle fried rice (3.5/5): my one loved this dish, and i think it was alright. when i think of fried rice i usually think of really greasy and oily late night eats after going out, and this (probably because is a much elevated version of the aforementioned), just didn't quite seem to hit the spot. i didn't particularly care for the addition of truffle, but there was good texture in there (got a lot of \"hard rice\" or crispy bits from the pan, which i like a lot).  - peking duck breast (4.5): this duck breast was on pointtt! very well cooked, so so so succulent. the sauce (or at least what was left of it; read point down below) was incredible in flavour. the only thing that sucked was that it came with so few pieces of that each of the 4 of us were only able to have 2. there was also a lot of other stuff/filler on the display, i.e. crispy wonton skins, coconut nuts, cooked zucchini. would be nice if there was more duck :D also, the xo dipping sauce for the wontons was extremely delicious.  Also, unfortunately, as the waiter was placing a plate on the table, he had tilted it and the dark sauce/juice from the peking duck breast splashed over my white dress :'( They handled it quite well offering me soda water/tide to go/his business card to expense dry cleaning - I'm just wishing it didn't happen in the first place, womp womp. I was so focused on cleaning my dress that when the last three dishes/main courses arrived, I didn't get to eat any of it until it got all cold.  Although this restaurant absolutely shocked me and I loved nearly all the flavours and spices that were used, I gotta say, us girls left hunnn-gryyy! I think the food is priced too high for the portions it's offering. I wouldn't rate it as a restaurant giving you the most bang for you buck, but it's a very nice treat.   Dai Lo - have you considered reviewing the pricing on your menu? I bet there'd be a lot/even more regulars coming through that door (myself included!)!  Ambience: 3.5/5 Cost: 2.5/5 Food: 4.5/5 Service: 3.5/5"}
{"text":"I've had the tasting menu here several times...best Asian fusion in the city, and at $55 not terrible value either."}
{"text":"If you want Asian fusion cuisine with a hipster ambience and detailed plating, Dailo is the place for you! This isn't a typical Chinese restaurant. They use a lot of Asian dishes, but put twists to them. Unique dishes and Experience is the key for this place.   My fave are the fried watermelon, fried trout, sweet and sour pork hock, and truffle rice. The fried watermelon had a really unique taste. It was fried, but maintained its crunchiness. The fried trout is really fresh. You get the entire fish with head. So good! The pork hock was flavourful. The truffle rice was different and tasted really flavourful as well.   I didn't like the sticky rice because it was dry. The waiter told us to roll the rice into a rice ball with your hands and then dip it in a sauce, which reminded me of what I did as a kid. Doing this didn't make the rice taste better, but I guess for the culinary experience, that was cool.   The wontons, which the waitress said was good, wasn't. It was a bit soggy. Definitely not traditional wontons. The crab salad was very disappointing because we couldn't even taste the crab. So little. The tomatoes were pretty good thought.   The dishes are meant to be shared tapas style. For 4 people, you will need about 8 to 10 dishes. This is a pricy place so make sure u are prepared. We were ok full, not the overstuffed type or the satisfying  full.   I do have to say the drinks looked pretty cool. We sat at the bar and the waitress kept making cool drinks. Definitely puts a lot of attention to detail with them!  I think this is a cool place to try for the experience of asian food with a twist, but don't expect it to be traditional Asian food. The prices also don't reflect Asian food. Think hipster Asian food.   I would go back for drinks and if I wanted to try something different!   Reservations recommended because we only got a table at the bar for 4 on a Friday evening at 7pm."}
{"text":"DaiLo was a great immersive foodie experience from the moment we set foot through the door! We were greeted by friendly and helpful front of house, eager to make our random Friday night walk-in a success. We were seated at the bar, and we had the pleasure of being hosted by a talented, attentive, and knowledgeable bartender.  You can tell that the team at DaiLo put a lot of detailed thought into every aspect of the restaurant. From the uniforms, to the menu, to the platware, and to the decor. Everything worked well to create a cohesive modern Asian experience.  The food was exciting and inventive, but payed proper homage to their Asian roots. Their \"char siu\" octopus was a flavour packed experience, using new ingredients to create a familiarly satisfying taste! Their fried watermelon was on point. Their spot prawns made an exciting congee.  Individually, all our dishes were technically well executed. What we felt lacking was better balance within the dishes themselves and with the course progression. There was a lot of fried, saucy, and heavy flavours. Well before we arrived at the superbly-prepared arctic char, our appetites were checked out.  Extremely excited to see Chinese cuisine being elevated in this way! Worth the experience and future frequentings!"}
{"text":"Wish we had one in the US. Creative, nostalgic, luxurious plates. None of the plates i ordered disappointed. This restaurant takes asian flavors to a new level. Place is trendy and comfortable. Its a cant miss!"}
{"text":"I saw a post on blog t.o. almost a year ago and was aching to try this place. Today I finally did. It's suppose to be asian fusion... i think?  But almost every dish was missing something the at could have made it delicious. We had the big mac bao (off menu request), dumplings, yu choy, fried watermelon, quail, and lamb. The big mac bun does not taste like a big mac, it made me want a real big mac from Mc Ds. The dumplings were the best dish (probably because it was topped with truffle). But I gotta say, this place is over hyped. I wanted to love this place but couldn't. The food is good but not worth the price tag that it comes with.    The service was amazing. Our waiter was very enthusiastic about the specials and he changed our bowls for us many times. The service was similar to that of a five star restaurant.  Unfortunately I primarily go out to eat to enjoy delicious foods so the amazing service doesn't justify the high price tag. Sorry!"}
{"text":"Went with a party of 4- menu makes for good sharing. Very pleasant meal and evening though it didn't knock my socks off. Cocktails sounded imaginative but were pretty close to bar standards by another name. Food was fresh, hot, tasty and imaginative. I liked the vibe and modern Asian chic ambience. Service team was young, friendly and energetic."}
{"text":"DaiLo really surprised me. I have put off going because I expected it to be another hipster den that was a bit heavy on pretence and a bit light on food. Boy, was I wrong.  While it does serve a hip crowd and have a funkier vibe, the food and the service are stellar. In fact, the service was attentive and professional at a level of the top white table cloth places in town. There was not a whiff of \"we-are-the-shit\" arrogance. Everything was explained well, every question was answered patiently, and help choosing wine was really great.  For the meal I opted for the 55$ tasting. A value for what I got. Unlike a lot of tastings, they ask you what you like and create a menu (from the a la carte menu) tailored to your unique tastes. The whole fried fish, pork loin, fried rice, and pea dumplings were all delicious. The food is east and southeast Asian inspired. They manage to hit the bullseye where creative and scrumptious intersect. Nothing is so \"out there\" that you can't enjoy, yet nothing comes across as McDonald-ized Asian either.  This is easily one of the best restaurants in Toronto. Bear in mind that the tables are close together and it can be loud. If you can handle that kind of vibe, you will love this place."}
{"text":"Everything about this restaurant is perfection! The food, the ambience, the service. Perfect for a date, a casual hangout or even  a small group party.   They serve mostly tapas style food,  with the exception of a couple of bigger sized dishes. Between my date and I, we had 3 tapas sized,  and 1 regular sized dishes and we were stuffed!   Here's what we had:  1) Ponzu Beef Carpaccio - holy smokes this was so delicious. The combination of the yuzu soy caramel sauce,scallion,fried garlic and the dwarf peach (surprisingly) was amazing!   2) Miso Salt Cod Brendade - this is actually my favourite item on the menu so far. I can't describe how tasty it was, but the creamy texture of the Brendade combined with the crispy basil and the out of this world flavor from the salt cod - let's just say we had to ask for extra bread pieces. Ps my date is French and he approved!   3) seared Napa Cabbage - this was my least favourite of the items we ordered. Mind you, my date saw the word raclette and immediately ordered (did I mention he's French). Nothing really special with this dish, if you're not the biggest fan of cabbage and the raclette was almost absent  4) Bulgogi glazed lamb neck -  eventhough we were so full, I'm glad we ordered this. It was absolutely a treat! The meat was tender enough you can pick them with your chopstick. It's served with a side of pear salad which was the perfect addition. The sweetness matched well with the puree and the lamb.     In addition to the food, what I think is really great about this restaurant is the service. Everyone were super helpful and friendly and there wasn't a time when I felt like \"oh, it's been awhile since we ordered\". I'm really glad that I found this gem and will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"lounge upstairs is such a good time on friday nights! high tables in a dark setting, drinks are great and the music is good, servers have a friendly super laid back vibe, ofc as other reviewers have mentioned big mac bao is a must have and hubby LOVES the truffle rice"}
{"text":"The pork hock is delicious and makes this place worth a visit. But overall, the food's just kinda... blah. It's also HIGHLY overpriced and the portions are tiny as hell, so be prepared to share with your dining companion. For better taste and value, try Luckee."}
{"text":"Have been here twice and will not come back again due to bad service both times. Most recently I came here on a Friday night with 2 others. Realizing that we have to wait since we had no reservation we were told we will get a table in 1.5 hours. After waiting for 1.5 hours at the place we were given some seats by the bar when they had two other open tables available. I asked the hostess if we can sit at the table after waiting for 1.5 hours and she said she never promised us a table and a bar is the best she can do. I found this very misleading and disingenuous and felt we were treated unfairly with false promises.  In addition, on both occasions servers took a very long time to take orders, bring food and serve a bill.  Too bad as the place itself is decent but the service is very underwhelming."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant!  The standouts were the octopus tacos, truffle rice, lamb and the ribs.  We also had the trout, fried melon, Asian greens and the wontons which were delicious as well.  Their service was impeccable as well."}
{"text":"My coworkers wanted to go for Asian food but on the \"fancier\" end so we gave Dailo a shot.  There were five of us and we ordered a bunch of items to share.   1) Fried Watermelon - we thought this was unique and wanted to try this.  I thought it would taste a lot better considering the price we pay for it. It just tasted fried with water (the watermelon wasn't very flavourful)   2) Big Mac \"bao\" - I saw pictures of this while I was yelping about what to eat.  The pictures looked good so I wanted to try this. The bao was hot and fresh, but was not flavourful. I wasn't a big fan of the sauce Adobe it.   3) Jellyfish Slaw - I really enjoyed this dish.  I thought it was very flavourful and the jellyfish was delicious.  I think this was one of their cheaper and bigger dishes.   4) Crispy Octopus Taco - this came with two tacos. The octopus tasted really good.   5) Miso Salt Cod Brandade - I ordered this thinking it was soup with the Chinese donut.   I realized that you dip the Chinese donut in the brandade.  The brandade didn't taste good alone. The cod was very minimal but when I had a bite of it, it was really good.  At the end, we finished all the Chinese donut, with a lot of leftover brandade.   6) Char Siu Pork Loin - I really enjoyed this dish too. The char siu was really good- so flavourful and juicy. I think it came with 3 steamed buns but we ordered an additional one.   7) Ponzu Beef Carpaccio - this dish was really good but there was not a lot of beef.   Overall, the atmosphere was really nice. The food are overpriced.  The portion of the food was also for snacking. It was a good experience, probably would not dine here again, as I would rather spend the money on different restaurants."}
{"text":"We came here this week on Monday night. It was pretty busy, and although there were 8 of us, we didn't have to wait very long for our food. It could've helped that we got the tasting menu, but then again, my shellfish allergy meant that they had to adjust and make a few dishes custom for me.   I really liked that the staff was aware of my allergy and kept track of the dishes. In one instance, they weren't sure if there was potential exposure to cross contamination or not, so they made me something again from scratch. So service wise, this is definitely 5 stars for me.  Food wise, this was a really good tasting menu for a number of reasons. 1) The size of each course really was a \"tasting\". None was overly large. Yet, 2) The number of courses meant we still left pretty full. In fact, at one point I thought \"Oh god, I hope there isn't any more food...\" and sure enough the dessert came. 3) everything tasted great. It left me wondering how everythign else on the menu tasted, and so I'll definitely come back to try everything else."}
{"text":"Eh. Lots of fried food. Nothing to write home about. Atmosphere is great though.   Had the fried Mellon, wontons, truffle fried rice and and fried trout."}
{"text":"we called in advanced to make resos and she said there was no need. We got there and she almost didn't give us a table because we didn't have resos. We sat down and noticed that the entire restaurant was filled with Caucasian people and the people I came with were Asians, maybe racial profiling? We sat down and three other tables sat down and we still didn't get water. I asked the busboy for our server and he said no. We sat there for almost 15 mins before was got water. Throughout the dinner, we asked numerous employees to get our server but only got ignored. Not happy with the service at alll. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"The octopus is stellar.    All of the text in a review can be basically summed up into one lead line, which really are the only words that matter.    Sure I could talk about the pleasant decor, the attentive staff, the excellent cocktail made with Rangpur gin.   But what's the point?   I could even go on to mention how we ordered the tasting menu and it was so much delicious food that we were completely stuffed with delicious food.   I could tell you about how we ordered two bottles of spectacular wine that although expensive, complimented the meal perfectly.   Or I could go on and mention how the main courses were both steak and an entire trout with-the-head that was served alongside truffle rice.    I could take a sidetrack and tell you that you should ALWAYS get anything with the word truffle in it.   But there's no reason to.   All you're going to read are the first few words.   And that's ok.  Because the octopus is really quite good."}
{"text":"First impression was that this is a beautiful restaurant. Murals painted on the walls and tin ceilings. Comfortable banquettes. The tables were a bit close together.  Service was impeccable. Our water glasses were constantly refilled with sparkling water at no charge. Our table stayed clean and dishes were changed out during the meal.  I love that the tasting menu gets customized based on size of group, preferences and dietary concerns. We wanted to try the rib eye, so they worked a menu around it. :)  What we ate ordered by my most favourite: Mandarin pannacota - this was perfect. Aloe Vera and sake sorbet - sounds weird but it was excellent Truffle fried rice with homemade xo sauce - so good Rib eye - this was surprisingly a bit chewy and may have rested too long as it wasn't particularly hot Pea vichyssoise with lobster and crab salad. I could have licked the bowl. Octopus taco on jicama - unique and yummy Fried trout that resembled and tasted like a chicken wing was a nice amuse bouche. Jellyfish and Napa cabbage slaw was refreshing and nice Chucharon dish - not sure what the actual name was. Basically pork rinds that got used to scoop up this pork terrine and quail egg dish. This was good. Fried wintermelon - glad we tried it as it was different. Good. Some fish creamy spread thing with dough fritters was okay. A bit heavy.  I would repeat again."}
{"text":"service on point, tried every cocktail and they all offered something different and orbited around a theme, food ranged from very good in a familiar sense to baffled by what you're tasting and so happy (pumpkin dumplings and the smoked anchovy topped custard for me), and so beautiful inside. it was really good."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food experience of my life!   I usually do not enjoy this style of cuisine.   The ingredients at DaiLo were high quality and the flavours were delicious.   Make sure to order the duck, the wontons, the truffle fried rice and the pork lion.   I will be back."}
{"text":"Was recommend to go here for dinner. We went with friends and it was absolutely incredible.  Ordered the $65 menu option and it was insane!  Preparation was beautiful and the service was off the charts.  Ask for Geoffrey!  Thanks for a great night!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in the city. Such an interesting fusion of flavours. We ordered our dinner and then ordered a second dinner because the food was so good that we wanted to try more of it. The salt cod and wonton dumplings stood out to me. Next time I want to try the tasting menu."}
{"text":"Recommend doing the 'Dailo's Choice' for $65/pp as the dishes are all about $13-55 anyway. Opted for al la Carte this time  Two of us shared: Crispy Octopus Taco (2pc) red braised pork belly, sambal aioli, jicama shell  Way better than I anticipated, not usually a big fan of pork belly but it was really crispy. I'd highly recommend trying them.  Torched Tamari Glazed Beef Carpaccio 90 day olliffe's rib cap, herb salad, nuoc mam, prawn cracker Really good but I wouldn't recommend ordering something this 'safe' here, they have such unique dishes at DaiLo you really need to get out of your comfort zone.  Pumpkin Dumplings soy brown butter sauce, Black truffles, \"white rabbit candy\" glaze, pepita crumble Ahhmazing! Great to share for two or with your party so you can try a few different items off of their menu.  Fried Watermelon is a must try! So flavorful, unique and delicious!  Braised beer gnocchi (with a side of sticky rice, which was necessary) the mushrooms in the gravy were delicious only negative comment I found it a little over salted, but could've just been the night.   Jellyfish Slaw napa cabbage, lime soy vinaigrette, sesame seeds. First time eating (or even hearing of) jelly fish on the menu. Was described as crispy, it was good but definitely our least favourite dish of the night. A little heavy on the sesame oil. (Wouldn't order again unless I was with a full table and everyone wanted to try a bite.)  I'd probably go for the trout next time ( if I didn't opt to have the chef selections) everything was great!! They have a team oriented service motto, food, drinks and smiling, knowledgeable servers bring it all to you as soon as your order is up. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"We were impressed with all the creation at DaiLo, where each item was a gustatory ode to various Chinese cuisine elements.  It is not fitting to call it a \"Chinese\" restaurant as indicated on Yelp, rather, it is a general Asian fusion restaurant featuring twists from various other types of Asian ethic cuisine.   We were allured by beautiful food photos and positive reviews on Yelp and decided to try few recommended dishes:  Deep-fried watermelon: how intriguing it is to eat a lightly battered and fried watermelon cube accompanied by beef floss, Thai basil leaves, and bean sprouts. All the elements mixed together to a very pleasant and unique taste, but if you were to eat the cube on its own, it would be quite bland.   Beef carpaccio: I really wished the delicious sauce hadn't overpower the beef. The beef slices were really thin, and the dish was of a dainty proportion but mostly importantly given the delicate, a bit buttery taste of the beef due to its slight marbling, it needed a light and complimentary sauce to lift it up rather than to drown it.   Feature of the day was a baked egg with a thin layer of soup and topped with cooked and shaved mushrooms, de-shelled mussel, deep fried pork. I found the egg custard was a bit too salty and when eaten with all its accompaniment, I didn't feel anything special.   Egg Net Salad is a good take on the Thai papaya salad. Beautiful dressing, ample ingredients that play off of each other's flavour and texture, but I didn't see the utility of having an \"egg net\", it didn't add to the flavour but did a spectacular visual appearance.   Rib eye was grilled so perfectly: it was juicy, tender, full of flavour we loved it! I think serving it on its own is enough and it certainly didn't need the accompaniment of bok choy, radish, soy pickled mushrooms etc. they are more of a fluff than a flavor-complement. And at $44/dish, it's a bit steep.   Oh well. We shared a bowel of sticky rice which was cooked perfectly and goes well with this type of family dining.   Furthermore, the service is tops! Our glasses were always filled with complementary sparkling water and we were checked upon frequently, and we absolutely adore the decor and the cute bar.   In terms of food though, I felt the alchemist behind all the dishes is like Icarus - the innovations are pushed a bit far that the combinations are not working well.   Cheerio!"}
{"text":"Really interesting meals inspired by Asian and French cuisine, warm, intimate atmosphere and good prices. It's good to order a few plates to share."}
{"text":"In my opinion this is the best in the city. Have done the tasting menu twice and both time was impressed."}
{"text":"Was invited there & as there were 8 of us we had to have the chef's tasting menu @ $55/pp. The food was AMAZING!!!!! Every mouthful was flavourful & decadent. The food is not your typical Asian fare. I think we tried about 16 different items including 3 different desserts.  Highlights were the whole fried fish, the rib eye, the deep fried watermelon, the 'fried' rice which seemed healthy then traditional fried rice, not oily @ all.  Décor was amazing, service was incredible, great vibe/atmosphere. I hope I can afford to go back in the future! If I died tomorrow, I'd want my last meal to be here =D =D"}
{"text":"Went with 2 friends - the 3 of us each had a big mac bao, and shared the fried watermelon, hakka brown wontons, satay grilled quail and prawn banh xeo. The only standout was the wontons, which had an interesting flavour. Service was good and the decor was pretty hip. Overall, we enjoyed our dinner."}
{"text":"We ate at Dailo on a Saturday night and had their special Chinese New Year tasting menu. The food was fantastic. The service overall was very good, though there were a couple inconsistencies that diminished the experience slightly.   We were not offered hot towels and were not told about the special New Year cocktail. Not a deal breaker, but since Dailo clearly strives for an amazing total dining experience these inconsistencies in service become glaring. The food however was why we chose to eat there and the Ninja Chef did not disappoint. My favourite bites of the evening are definitely the fried watermelon, which was refreshing and a delicious way to start the evening, and the curried frogs legs.   The deep fried whole trout was also very good and beautifully plated. Decor is trendy but in a timeless way with nods to classic Chinese diner decor. The Tufted banquette is nicely done.  I'm def going back to try the regular menu - especially the truffle fried rice. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We took some friends here to dine. Our favorites were the pork hock, crispy octopus, wontons and the truffle fried rice. My only gripe is that the portions are miniscule. The bites are super tasty and flavors are unique. I had the tom yum booze cocktail which had a good kick to it. The menu is split between one bites and shareable apps and mains. Server got his math wrong and charged us less. We did not realize this until we stepped out and were ready to walk to the streetcar and he came down chasing us apologizing for his mistake. The restaurant got really busy quickly and it was a tad loud but we got a nice private booth. The service was decent and we never felt like we had to wait for too long to be served. The desserts don't look all that interesting on paper but were not bad. The banana split had some interesting spice to it and the sugar cake reminded me of a popular dish in our culture. Definitely a place to check out and should soon rise in popularity with word of mouth."}
{"text":"This is an awesome asian fusion restaurant that allows you to experience types of food that are hard to find elsewhere"}
{"text":"I always get hesitant when a place opens to great fanfare.  Usually, it's overrated.  I came in already anticipating the high prices others have complained about.   What I wanted to see is if the vibe was as exciting as others said.     Our bartender was like a school girl who wouldn't settle for anything less than an A on a science project.  She was meticulous and an absolute perfectionist when it came the drink order.  Although it took a while, she produced 3 solid cocktails (my favorite was the Tom Yum booze).  As a whole, the food was good.  My biggest complaints were the hakka brown dumplings which were a sloppy uninspired mess and the sugar cake dessert with was sticky rice sitting atop an undercaramelized sauce and garnished with sea buckthorn and lime leaf (I don't think either one worked).  I also found spiciness of each dish to be almost exactly the same and soon became a bit predictable and monotonous.    It is loud and boisterous but has a good vibe in general, all of which are key components in the foodie blueprint regardless of the cost of the food and drink. It's a bit slow though.   In the end, a solid contributor to the College Street food scene. It should have some longevity as a key player in Toronto's small plate movement."}
{"text":"We came here for a dinner on our visit to Toronto.  It did not looked packed to the brim, but I think it fills up so reservations may be a good idea.  We decided to go with the tasting menu along with wine pairings.  It was GREAT.  It wasn't just a standard tasting menu.  They checked with us for anything we won't eat, if there was anything we were looking for.  We saw somewhere there was mention of sambal sauce and we told the waitress we were recently in Bali and would enjoy that being incorporated.  They incorporated that theme into two dishes for us.  The sommeliers were very knowledgeable and I think had great pairing picks.  It is certainly a splurge meal, but well worth it!  You never feel rushed, they space it out so well, food is delicious, and service is great.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Randomly decided to stop by here on the windiest weekend night, heard great things about it from a friend + the good reviews on Yelp. I'm giving it 3 stars solely because of the taste, service and ambience are definitely 5/5.   I have to say that none of the food I had was mind-blowingly good. We asked for the tasting menu ($65pp). It's one of those places that you get really hopeful for what's coming up next, because you want to believe what you're chewing can't be the highlight of the meal.   To be fair, the wonton with peanut sauce was quite flavourful. The beef carpaccio was tender, ummm but again probably as good as other places that also make it. Mapo tofu was pretty good. I didn't like the cauliflower soup and the soy sauce bruised pork belly. Too oily...  Worth the try but probably won't go back."}
{"text":"This restaurant was named by Toronto Life as one of 2014's 10 Best.   I can see why.    Described as \"Asian Fusion\", the food is impeccable, and goes well BEYOND \"high end Chinese\" that other restaurants in this category often are or become.   The service was also amazing, demonstrating the teamwork and care that elevates the experience beyond ordinary.   Go!"}
{"text":"Can't say enough about how much i enjoyed my experience here. Great atmosphere to kick back and eat great tasty food. We ordered the tasting menu, great server who helped us choose some dishes that wouldn't have been on our radar. The standouts were the Egg net salad, octopus taco, and the trout was perfect!; wished we could order some steamed buns and a tube of kewpie mayo to make sammies on the spot. I could also skip it all and eat a plate full of their awesome smoked trout betel leaves, YUM!  Great service, left happy and satiated."}
{"text":"What an exceptional experience.   A restaurat by Nick Liu, and chef'd by Dennis Tay? This is a lot of food love in one place. Don't believe me? Order the chefs menu and prepare yourself for an experience.   and as a p.s - the dry aged rib eye is the best in the city at that price. I'm still thinking about it."}
{"text":"DaiLo was an excellent culinary experience in a stylish setting.  It doesn't look like anything special from the outside, but you'll understand my excitement once you walk in. The walls have beautiful, distressed Asian-style murals. The gold screens scattered around the dining room for privacy just barely glint in the low light. The skylight by the bar makes it glow like a gem at the heart of a cave. While this is all overly dramatic, it's also true.   The food was excellent. My companion and I ordered the chef's tasting, which ended up being about 8 courses. They were glad to accommodate her dietary restrictions while serving me the planned tasting for the night, which was classy. They didn't compromise, either: all of her dishes were delicious. The portions were very large and exceeded my expectations - we couldn't finish everything.   The service was good, but not quite as good as everything else. Our waiter was around a fair bit, but was hard to find a few times and we were made to wait to order drinks and to get the check.  Overall, I highly recommend going to DaiLo and trying as much different food as you can. It's a great spot to take someone special and enjoy some excellent food."}
{"text":"Great service at lo pan! Bartender was friendly, food was amazing i was sooo stuffed. But the food just had be going! Cheers to you guys"}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night, tried the chefs tasting menu and everything was awesome.  It was about 9 courses and allowed us to try many things that I would not have chosen myself.  The restaurant has a cool vibe to it and is spacious enough that you are not on top of the other guests.  Great spot and great food, I will be back."}
{"text":"Another quite special place in Toronto that I really like and always recommend to my friends. It can be a challenge to get a reservation on short notice and you certainly have to pay for the great environment and the food they serve. However to people like myself who look for something truly unconventional when they go out, it's 100% worth it."}
{"text":"What I personally appreciate most about a restaurant from a business perspective is the willingness to constantly improve. Toronto is a city where dining out has become a pass time and the result is a surge of demand not only for a dining experience but for a place to hang out for the night. Unfortunately, lots of easy business seems to have fostered in some cases a sense of mediocrity. After all, why put forth more effort when you don't have to for the same dollars in, right?     I've eaten at Dailo several times since its inception and despite its almost instant popularity and highly favourable reviews in the press, the owners seem to be constantly trying to innovate. The food in general is fantastic, but I think other reviews on Yelp have already covered the individual dishes, so let's assume we all love Nick Liu's cooking. They've kept some of the favourites on the menu, but do a great job of constantly offering new variety and are willing to change things up if they don't think something isn't working. Good for business, good for margins, but also shows that they care about their clients evolving tastes.   The service I think was a bit choppy at first as they ironed out some of the kinks, but as time has passed I've noticed staff getting better at their jobs and staffing changes made resulting an overall better service dynamic in the restaurant. Of course having Anton Potvin around doesn't hurt, he seems to know each and every person seated on a first name basis.  Even slight tweaks in the decor, sound level and lighting have made a difference. There was probably a decent amount of capital sunk into the restaurant to begin with but that doesn't seem to deter the management from trying to make the overall atmosphere better.  So yeah, this is getting long winded but you get the point, Dailo respects its clientele, serves up great food and tries to make you feel that you are getting the experience you paid for."}
{"text":"I've been to Dailo a few times and have always enjoyed their food and their service is great. Their deep fried watermelon is my go to dish and their tasting menu always has a combination of their most popular dishes and new ones. I always ask if Dennis Tay from Top Chef is working in the back and he always stops by to say hi when he is."}
{"text":"Delicious Asian fusion cuisine! Although prices seem a bit inflated for Asian food, the price-to-taste ratio is good, and everything we had were very tasty!  An amuse bouche of chawanmushi with tamari pearls set a great tone to our evening - it was great both presentation-wise and taste-wise.  Of all the dishes that night, I especially recommend the Hakka Brown Wontons - bet you can't have just one! The pumpkin dumplings are also quite nice.  The lamb neck rendang is fall off the bone tender and is a great dish to share.   Service was great throughout the evening, and our server was extremely patient with us. Executive chef Nick Liu even came by and signed the Toronto Eats book for us!  Only thing to nitpick on is the sticky rice with the lamb neck dish - which I found to be a tad too dry. The cocktail drinks there are very pretty and worth trying, but ultimately lacks that \"punch\" that makes a cocktail truly great and memorable.  Overall, I would definitely recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Very unique Asian fusion food! We tried the tasting menu that came with 7 different dishes. Everything was so unique and flavourful I can't even compare it to any other restaurant I've ever been to but it was such a nice change. They also have really cool cocktails that were both light and refreshing. I don't even know what we ate, but the highlights were definitely the taco like dishes, tofu and the lobster which was the main event! The lobster was massive and delicious! By the end of the meal I was so full I couldn't move! Overall good food and cocktails."}
{"text":"Wow, wow, wow! I don't know where to begin. To foreword, this was the best meal of my life.  I needed to try this restaurant after reading the review in Toronto Life's 20 Best New Restaurants issue. I figured getting a reservation would be difficult, so decided to book on a Tuesday evening as soon as they opened to avoid the 7pm dinner rush. I was pleased I did because it started to get quite busy around that time. My friend and I decided that to try as much as possible, it was best to order a bunch of items off the appetizer menu. There wasn't much that intrigued me from the entree portion anyhow.   We started our journey with an order of fried watermelon, crispy octopus fresh rolls and ponzu beef carpaccio. The fried watermelon is one of the best things I have EVER had. It is perfectly battered, and the fresh basil transforms the flavour into something spectacular. I have craved this dish every day eating it.  The octopus fresh rolls were so good we ordered them twice throughout our meal. The octopus is super fresh and the sauces paired with it are awesome. I felt this was kind of a taco/spring roll fusion and I loved every bite.   I had never tried beef carpaccio until this night and now I'm afraid to try it anywhere else. Perfectly dressed - 5 stars.  On our second round of ordering, we got the Hakka brown wontons, egg net salad and sweet and sour pork hock. The salad was a bit lack luster, but still good. I enjoyed the wontons more than the pork hock, it was opposite for my friend. I did thoroughly enjoy the jellyfish slaw that accompanied the pork though.  Lastly, we got the Big Mac Bao which was as awesome as everyone says. I feel like it's a way-better version of the greasy burger you crave after a night of drinking.   We ordered a dessert and I regret to say that I forget the name. It was A+ though and a great way to end a superb meal.  I want to tell everyone I know about this place!"}
{"text":"DaiLo gets 3 stars for good ambience, great service and delicious cocktails. So what happened to the other 2 stars? Taste of the food and the price.    For $97, all we got was 2 cocktails, an order of wontons, beef carpaccio and charred Napa cabbage.  For $11, we got 6 pork and shrimp wontons that tasted just ok. The beef carpaccio was the best tasting dish. I love that it was loaded so many different herbs such as mints, cilantro, fried garlic and shrimp chips but the fish sauce was a bit too much making it a bit too salty. Getting to the most disappointing dish of the night, charred Napa cabbage.  For $15, we got 1/10 of a cabbage served with mayo!  I know it's Asian fusion food but mayo?!!?  Needless to say, it wasn't my cup of tea.    Perhaps, we picked the wrong dishes but then again, we were told we can't go wrong with any of the items in the menu."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! Best things were the pea dumplings and octopus tacos. The duck was my least favorite, but still pretty good. Loved the novelty of the Big Mac bao. Also, our server was freaking amazing. Nice ambiance as well!"}
{"text":"Wow! Went here this evening with three girlfriends and we got the Share Platter (I think that's what it was called). I highly recommend this! The food just kept coming and everything was amazing. It was nice to be able to try bits of everything. We were all very full by the time the dinner ended. We also ordered cocktails which were so good.  I thought the staff was wonderful, friendly and knowledgeable. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Amazing and very unique Chinese food! Their drinks are also delicious and are beautifully executed along with the food.   Favourites include: truffle fried rice, pumpkin truffle ravioli, and fried watermelon.  I forget the name of the drink (first on the cocktail menu) it comes in a brass pineapple and is so good!!   Service is always friendly too! It's always pretty busy but I'm always accommodated  Overall consistent and delicious food!"}
{"text":"I know I'm late to this party... by a couple of years.  Chef Nick Liu has been one of the celebrated Toronto chefs bringing delicious food in new and creative ways to Little Italy.  It just happens he does it from an Asian point of view.  I do appreciate how he melds traditional Asian concepts or flavours and puts a modern twist on it.  Fusion... sure.  Fun... absolutely.    The restaurant itself is bigger inside than from peering into the windows.  It does pay homage to Asia with it's well known design notes & accents.  Delicately patterned screens, a large watercolour landscape picture on the wall, and wooden carved accents on top of pillars.  It gives a nod without shoving it down your throats with bamboo lettering.  Though it takes nods from the past, it has its focus on the 'now' with it's modern vibe ... almost like an industrial modern loft vibe with exposed brick work and ceiling.  The quick summary ... great date night spot.  It has enough dim lighting that you look great without the need of alcohol.  Service here is EXCELLENT.  Polished, refined, friendly, and never pushy... this just sets up for a great evening.  Everyone from the actual server to the individuals bringing the plates to the table... all on point.  They seemed interested in providing a great experience, checked in throughout the night, and even described each item in detail.   It seems weird to say that's rare... but it actually is.  The menu is vast and a lot of it is very intriguing on paper... do what we did and just order the Chef menu.  It is tailored to you and your table.  There were 4 tables side by side who got the chef menu and after the 2nd dish, none of the dishes were the same.    Miso Cauliflower & Shimeji Soup (amuse bouche) - Im not a big fan of miso soup and not because i dont like the flavours.  I just find it incredibly salty in most places.  I do like the fact that it had shimeji mushrooms and given a bit of a different note with the varied ingredients.  3.5/5  Octopus Taco on Jicama Shell - Loved the creativity on this... who would have thought that gigantic white carrot looking thing would be the perfect taco shell?  It gives a natural crunch without heat or deep frying and is a nice contrast to the hot crispy and tender octopus.  The sambal adds a nice flavour punch with a touch of spice.  This was really good.  The menu says there's pork belly in there but I ate this so fast that my brain didnt catch it.  Oops. 5/5  Beef Carpaccio (90 day aged rib cap) - Another fusion dish but this time, the influence is Italy.  This was amaaahzing.  I love the flavours.  With the lightly sweetened fish sauce, garlic, citrus, and chilli AND herbs on top... this was just a great dish of bold flavour and super tender beef.  I could eat this a lot.  The rib cap had a nice beefy flavour that came from the aging.  5/5  Hakka Brown wonton (pork & shrimp) - I would say this would be the most traditional Chinese item we received.  I'm not a wonton expert but I've been eating them since I was a kid.  I will be honest, I'm not sure if this was executed as well.  Dumplings to Asians is almost important as rice. Filling and wrapping is equally key.  These ones... the wrappings werent so good.  Unfortunately they fell apart too easily (overcooked and gooey) and though the filling seemed good.  The sesame oil was heavy handed and I think it drowned out the XO sauce.  3/5  Big Mac Bao (90 day aged beef) - So this is the famed Big Mac bao ... playing on my childhood flavours.  Dailo takes a well known fast food and elevates with homemade sauces, home made process cheese (irony ... yes but it's a great one), and great beef and stuffs it into a beloved dimsum dish ... the steamed bao.  This has be written up many times and I can see why.  It's great bar food. It has a nice beefy juice filling that you can mash into the 'secret sauce' to add that tangy sweet aioli-like sauce.  Quick note, it's is off menu.  It's definitely not on the Dailo Menu and it might be on their LoPan bar menu.  It's creative, delicious, and fun to eat.  5/5  Pumpkin Dumplings with 'White Rabbit' butter sauce - I wasn't sure what to make of this one as 'White Rabbit' is a candy I ate only during Chinese New Year and Moon Harvest.  I wasn't sure how the super sweet creamy candy would meld with a savoury dish.  I give full props to Chef Liu to using something so wildly different ... it's definitely inventive.  It was interesting to have but I'm not sure I would order it again.  1st reason is same as the wonton.  Wrappers fell apart and more gummy than supple.  The butter and candied sauce is wild... bold, in your face, and unapologetic.  Have to admit, he did balance it better than I imagined.  Filling was super smooth.  3.5/5  Whole Fried Giggie Trout - ORDER THIS.  One of the best whole fish dish I've had in Toronto.  Tender, not oily, or dried out... the 3 dipping sauces added to it. 5/5  Sake & Aloe Vera sorbet with candied ginger - Light & refreshing 4/5"}
{"text":"I'm normally fiercely against the term \"asian fusion\", but this place demonstrates how lovely it can be when done right. We made a reservation for a Friday night dinner and we scored a comfy booth. Our server was attentive, knowledgeable and seemed to genuinely love the food. He helped us set up a course while being mindful that my friend couldn't eat pork. A note on the design: this place is pretty - rather than in your face exotica, it's a mix of understated Chinese motifs and modern, industrial elements.   Food thoughts: - Roast Duck Tacos: No longer on the menu but a fun story, our awesome server added an extra taco when the three of us were debating how to share two neatly - Jellyfish slaw: springy, savoury and a refreshing citrus note - Pumpkin Dumplings: The star! The White Rabbit sauce was really clever. We thought we were ordering real rabbit so the milky taste of the sauce was a pleasantly surprising throwback to the candy! - Singapore Curry Cauliflower: Good but I prefer \"Singapore curry\" with a stronger kick - Truffle Fried Rice: The truffle was an interesting twist along with the diverse textures in the rice.  Though you can find quality Chinese food in Markham/Scarborough at a much lower price, this is a different experience. As a Chinese-Canadian, I value this restaurant for walking the thin line between two identities respectfully and I appreciate that their prices are backed by a warm and elegant experience instead of trying to \"elevate street style\". While I can't afford to eat here regularly, it is worth it for special moments."}
{"text":"I love their cocktails at this place! Delicious and inventive.  The menu is a little challenging to understand at first. Without squeezing too much of your brain juice and help from the servers (they're awesome here by the way) you'll be on your way in no time in knowing what you'll want to try once they break it own effortlessly for you. This time round I tried the Singapore curry cauliflower . The portion came in larger than what I had expected. The taste was not too spicy and had a good amount of sauce. The char siew pork loin came with nice pairing of Asian pear mustard sauce with radish slaw and steamed buns.  I would also recommend to try their sticky rice, something simple, but will done. Beware, do not over order as it's very filling."}
{"text":"I will be telling everyone I know to eat here when they visit Toronto! Found this place through Yelp as I was visiting Toronto with my husband. We had a Saturday evening dinner reservation and enjoyed every aspect of our visit. The interior was very cool and great atmosphere. Our server was so helpful, we ordered the 'Dailo's Choice' which is like a Chef tasting menu. The server asked us which dishes we liked the sound of and if there was anything we didn't like and tailored the choices to suit us. The cocktails were fantastic and really complemented the food. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Finally I went there! A very good 4.5, as food items are all tasty, well executed; service if friendly and can make good suggestions  Why not 5... well, the place remains expensive, and portion sizes are quite small for any hungry person... thus, you need to order and re-order to feel full. also deserts are bit sub-par compared to all other main items. Finally, as for any \"tapas\" place, each item is a hit or miss... whereas most where top notch, one or two were just ok,,, for example, I am not sure that the bao mac is worth a try... it is really a tiny big mac with bao instead of bread...the tuna or ceviche fish taco remains a tiny fish taco, which won't beat a good huge fish taco in almost any good fine mexican restaurant). other items were super good (and try the daily items +++)"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great service. Excellent, creative dishes. We tried:  Fried watermelon: this is so good l. Love the contrast between the fried outside and sweet watermelon inside. Definitely a must try.  Ponzu beef carpaccio: enjoyed the ponzu sauce and the beef. This dish was a bit on the light side.   Prawn banh xeo: this was good, but I didn't think it was great. An interesting take on the banh xeo but kind of lacked flavour. But I prefer the real vietnamese banh xeo.  Duck breast: loved this dish. Duck breast was tasty and cooked to perfection. The brussel sprouts were amazing.  Jellyfish slaw: a decent slaw. Wasn't much jelly fish in there though.  Tom yum cocktail: so good, very interesting flavour. Really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Very nicely set restaurant. Beef carpaccio was one of the most tasty dishes I've ever had. Pumpkin, candy dumplings tasted fascinating, very fun and unique. Peking duck dish was sub-par, but generous in portion. Excellent experience overall."}
{"text":"Modern twist to Asian food in a warm antique setting!  We were walking along College looking a quick bite prior to our show at 8PM - we passed by a couple of places when the sign outside caught our attention - \"Dailo and Lopan\". My initial thought was there must be typo but then my Chinese knowledge kicked in and brought a quick smile to my face as it was a neat word play. We didn't have reservations but said lets give it try which was the beginning of a great food adventure :)  As we entered, a friendly host greeted and told us she could squeeze us in for a table of 2 beside the bar. The coat check was great as you didn't have lug around your jackets. Inside, the interior was dark wood flooring with neat box seats on side and open seating on the other. I loved the old fashioned wall paper which gave me a feel of 1920s Shanghai but updated. We sat by the bar on a high top table which had retro black and white photos on the wall. Our server was super friendly while offering free sparking or flat water.  After explaining the menu, we were pleasantly surprised to hear that it was a \"tapas\" style menu with small plates and mains to share. So, on to the food:  Starters: Hakka brown wontons - don't like the small bowl fool you in thinking it is just another dumpling. The wontons are coated in a gravy-like sauce that had a great pop in the mouth. Couldn't just eat one or two or even three :)  Miso Salt Cod Brandade - initially we weren't quite sure what to expect as we thought this was going to like anchovies served on toasted bread but it was a wonderful dish. It was probably our favourite dish - anchovies + salt cod blended in to mashed potatoes topped with little fried fish. The dip went amazing with the traditional chinese bread!   Scallops with vermicelli - this was one of the specials of the day where it was scallops in the shell topped with a seasoned vermicelli. Yummy!  Main: Char siu pork lion - this was my 2nd favourite dish and server had a perfect description for it which was a deconstruced char siu bao :). The dish is served with two hot steamed buns which you then make up your own bao with the radish, pork lion and sauce. My first bite - wow - nice smokey and sweet flavours :). I've seen other places used pork belly (which is a bit too fat for me) so the pork lion had the right meat on it. Winner!  Banana leaf grilled mackeral - our last dish was also the special which was a whole mackeral wrapped in a banana leaf and grilled to perfection. It is a whole fish so you need to be careful on bones but the fish was cooked exactly to \"fall off the bone\" with a spicy sauce. It was served with a side of coconut scented rice and salad. Definitely tasty!  In all, we were super happy to have stumbled on Dailo and we'll definitely come back to try the tasting menu and dessert!"}
{"text":"The food surpassed my expectations. Definitely a strong Asian influence (dumplings and wontons) but also crispy octopus tacos, pork belly , shrimp and tamarind, delicious deep fried trout. Each dish had so many flavours. You could taste the sweet, spice and savory flavours in each. I shared the tasting menu plus a side of amazing beef carpaccio. I would highly recommend this restaurant. A truly memorable meal!"}
{"text":"Deliciously outside my comfort zone...  I eat out a TON, however the types of cuisines I frequent are standard things like Italian, Seafood, French, etc... Overall I'm pretty selective. However I decided to take a step out of my comfort zone and Dailo didn't disappoint.   We almost ordered everything on the menu, and are all items I would order again. Service was fantastic, the ambiance was fantastic... Highly recommended. No brainer."}
{"text":"The Beef Carpaccio and Truffle Fried Rice were my favourite dishes. The brandade was also tasty but this dish is not on the regular menu. We weren't really impressed by other dishes. I didn't find the flavour elements in the dishes to combine well together.  Unlike Susur Lee's fusion, there was something off or out of tune with a lot of the dishes. I also found most of the dishes we tried to be extremely salty. On a more positive note, the staff were superb and attentive considering how busy they were."}
{"text":"Tried chef tasting menu for two. We didn't like quail that was part of our meat dish as much but the rest were all pretty good. I'm not crazy about going back to the place to try more though. I would sum up their food as upscale fusion Chinese."}
{"text":"Fusion doesn't always work and I feel it applys to this place. I guess the chef tries to make tapa style kind of Chinese fusion dishes, which reminds me of El Catrin. And just like El Catrin, I find the food pretentious and the flavor is just OK. Portion size is extremely small. I don't mind spending 40 dollars on a meal (and still with a bit room for more) , but it just won't be another time here."}
{"text":"Delicious asian fusion.... is an understatement. This place has a lot of qualities I look for in a go to joint. Unique/delicious food... Check. attentive and friendly staff.. Check. Cool atmosphere.. Check. Also a signature drink menu plus a two page wine menu.  Must tries: Big Mac bao (play on the McDonald's staple), skate (seasonal), pumpkin ravioli (most interesting dish I've had in my life).wasnt a huge fan of the duck wings: they got pretty messy.  Very good spot, I'll be back.."}
{"text":"Loved this place and would definitely come back.  We had the chef's choice menu ($55 pp) and it was worth it.  It was a very nice selection of the menu and they made sure anything we wanted to try from the menu was incorporated.  An amuse bouche, 7 small dishes, the 3 larger ones.    The highlight/my faves were - amuse bouche was like asian deviled eggs.  Very tasty. - fried watermelon - refreshing with very nice savory flavors.  Can't really taste the watermelon though. - Octopus salad - like a vietnamese beef salad but with little grilled octopus. - Octopus taco  - Hakka wontons - Halloumi tofu - like ma pao tofu and came with sticky rice - the mains - whole fried fish, truffle fried rice, and yuchoy/veggies.  They were tasty but I preferred the smaller dishes (maybe we were too full by then).  It was a lot of food but we ordered dessert anyways...we could not resist the calamansi honey cruller.  It was a warm crispy donut and a nice spoonful of ice cream.   Everything was for sharing/family style which was great.  Service was excellent and the resto had a nice vibe.  Can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"It has been a while since I last dined at DaiLo, and they are still serving amazing modern Chinese food with excellent service.  I had mistaken the date of my reservations for the day before but the host was extremely nice to squeeze us in on a busy Saturday night, which was highly appreciated given it was also Father's Day weekend (we were there for that reason) and with the Taste of Little Italy going on, and walk-ins are near impossible on weekends.  The dishes were just as good as I last remembered and it's great that their menu hasn't changed much which made ordering very easy. This includes the fried watermelon, whole fried giggie trout, and truffle fried rice with homemade XO sauce (all must-orders) -- seems like most tables were ordering the same thing. I also ordered the squash dumplings topped with black truffle and a White Rabbit Candy glaze, which was a nice dish with lots of flavour and is not as sweet as it sounds, and the Hakka brown wontons which is a subtly modern take on a classic comfort food dish. All of this was a nice amount of food for the 3 of us.  The cocktails were also well crafted with nice layering of Asian flavours which added a nice twist to classic drinks, and a must order to start your dinner.  For the quality and execution of food and excellent service (our water glasses were constantly filled), it was good value. Yes, many may think it's pricey for Chinese food, but this is no ordinary Chinese restaurant.  I'm looking forward to trying their food at their second location in the Assembly Chef's Hall.  Thank you Dailo!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Dailo. I've been hearing rave reviews about this place for years and finally got to try it. The atmosphere was great, the service was impeccable, and the decor was very cute. But the food was just not there, definitely not worth what they were charging. Almost felt like they were trying too hard to be unique/interesting, but the taste was really blah, and the portion was very small. Prefer Lee or R&D for much better Asian fusion."}
{"text":"Wow. Incredible, incredible. We walked in to get a table for 2 and were seated almost immediately on a Thursday evening. The food here is absolutely (no joke) the most flavourful food I've had in a long, long time. On top of that, it's well priced and the service is incredible."}
{"text":"What to try:  If you have the money, try the chefs table! For $65, you get to try 10 different items from their menu. And you get a flavour of almost every type of meat. But if you don't, I'd suggest the 90 day dry aged rib eye (look at my pics - rib eye?!? And it's medium rare?! Spells delicious!), the char Sui pork loin (very tasty if you like the char Sui sauce honey glazed kind of deal!) and the fried watermelon (because it's unique!)  What to expect:   place is generally very busy. Because of the poor acoustics of the place, it becomes really noisy and you are yelling most of the time or else good luck getting your message through to someone across the table! May not be the best place for a romantic intimate dinner if that's the case!  Last tips:   I say for chefs table, best to go with one or two ppl. When you go with more ppl, because it's a shareable platter instead of everyone getting their own separately, the portion sizes can get fuzzy. May feel like you got the same for two ppl at times but they say they try to top it up by giving more per platter and adding one or two more entrees with more ppl added to the party. Reserve a table as drop-ins may have to wait quite a bit!"}
{"text":"I visited DaiLo with a group of four and was very impressed. We got to try a lot of the menu items as well as one of the specials and I loved every bite. I cant say that there was one item that I didn't really enjoy. The service was fantastic, and the rate that the food was coming out was perfect. I am very much looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Disappointed. Been twice because different friends wanted to go try it. I have to say that I think this place is really overrated  Service -hipster rude.  Different person for every aspect of our meal.  We got the chefs menu: started w afried fish on a slaw,  3 wontons, 3 fried watermelon cubes, egg custard, our main was this big \"Friday fish\" and fried rice. Beautifully presented but be warned there are hundred of little pin like bones throughout the whole thing that WILL get stuck in your throat. Try finding those in a candle lit restaurant. The rest of the food was balanced but I wasn't that impressed. Also went up to the bar where the drinks are more or less the same as the resto below. The places was empty and drafty, didn't have much ambiance. I wouldn't return"}
{"text":"We chose this place because it was listed as one the new restaurants to try in En Route magazine. They have this great tasting menu with 5-6 courses (total of 11 dishes) so you get to try a bunch of different plates without feeling like a fatso, but end up needing to be rolled out anyway... Everything, from their amuse-bouche to the last course, had amazing flavour and service was great!"}
{"text":"The feel of DaiLo is decidedly different.  Asian in a way you can't quite place.  Not Cantonese, not Thai, not Malay - sort of a fusion of all of them with a modern flair.  This is present in both the atmosphere and the food.  I liked the small touches such as the vintage place settings covered in ornamental art, the screen paintings and eastern inspired wall paper.  My favourite thing on the menu is whatever one else raves about; the big mac Bao.  Oddly it isn't on the menu but is offered from the restaurant upstairs.  I also tried the fried watermelon and the quail; each of which was delicious  and unique.    What I liked the most is that I haven't experienced another place like DaiLo.  In presentation, ambiance and taste it stands out as completely different."}
{"text":"I was told to check this place out by one of my chef friends that used to cook with DaiLo's owner back in Australia. All I can say is I'm glad we finally have food this good in Canada. This place is a great addition to college street... different from all the Italian spots.  The dishes here are fun, sexy, flavorful and fresh. Great date spot or good spot for small groups. Everything is basically family style. Get 2-3 dishes per person or so and share them all. There's also a nice bar upstairs. Menu changes with the season."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic. It's been over a week since I went and I'm still raving about it.  Chinese food with a twist, I guess. Ordered roasted duck tacos, pumpkin ravioli (blew my mind!), truffle fried rice (truffle AND fried rice? c'mon, you know it's gonna be a winner), rib-eye steak (melt in your mouth goodness). Didn't find anything wrong with any of those dishes, and the portions were a good size for sharing with one or two other people (depending on your hunger). Service was attentive.  What's another way to say highly recommended? Yeah, that."}
{"text":"Good God, woman. Go to DaiLo.   I glommed on to my husband's work dinner recently, as I'm known to do, and I'm extra glad I did this time. The chef's tasting dinner at DaiLo was one of the most beautiful meals I've had in recent memory.   There were many, many courses, but these were my favourites. If you only get these, you will have a memorable meal:  +Fried watermelon  +Hakka brown wontons  +Whole fried trout  +Mai Tai +Vodka martini  Fine, you caught me, those last two are liquor. But trust me, they don't just know their way around a kitchen, they're fierce with their shakers and tiki cups, too."}
{"text":"Came here for Valentines dinner and was thrilled with every dish. Super flavourful tapas. We opted to stick to the regular menu as it was more enticing than the VDay one. We tried the much hyped Big Mac bao and were not disappointed, as well as the octopus taco, sweet and sour pork, haloumi, pumpkin dumplings, beef carpaccio, and the trout. I would never normally be drawn to trout but it came highly recommended and it was unbelievable--see pics!"}
