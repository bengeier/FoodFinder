{"text":"First of all we wanted to try this place for the first time and we just purchased a groupon so we decided to go. We were excited at first the bread and salad were good but the meals were ok nothing spectacular for the price. Our major disappointment came when we were ready to pay, the server was less than pleasant when we handed her the groupon, then when she brought back our revised bill she marked a 20 percent gratuity on it! Really?!?!?! A tip is based on your service and not on what you think you deserve. Her service was ok at best and being in the restaurant industry we were going to tip her on the entire amount but since she wrote it in the credit card tip line we decided not to tip her on the entire bill! Needless to say we will NOT be returning! I will be sure to spread the word!"}
{"text":"We frequent this restaurant at least a couple times a month and have for years.  After tonight, I may never go back.  It is Sunday night and we walked in, a party of 5 behind another couple.  At best, the restaurant is one-third full.  The first sign of trouble was that it took a while for the couple ahead of us to be seated.  Finally when we approached the hostess, she had to run back to the rear seating area to \"check\".  (This despite the fact that she had just been back there).  She returned and told us it would be a 5-10 minute wait.  I pointed to the empty 10 tables to my left and asked why.  She explained they only had a couple of waitresses working and they needed to catch up.  What????  I went to the rear seating area and there were 4 empty tables.  I asked if we could be seated and was told no.  At that point we walked out.  Terrible way to treat loyal customers.  Seating us with an explanation would have been better than making us stand there."}
{"text":"This place is in a out of the way location,it has a nice clean atmosphere.

The menu is full,had the chicken Parmesan,it was what it should be,great tasting.

Staff was VERY good.

Will be back."}
{"text":"Staff was pleasant, food wasnt. Ordered eggplant parm, was not good. i have had better from the frozen section at walmart."}
{"text":"The chicken franchise is my favorite! They have really good wedding soup and house salad dressing. We ordered a large amount of good for a party and everything tasted wonderful and if was a breeze ordering."}
{"text":"Your take-out spaghetti dinner with meatballs is quite tasty.  A nice sized salad and Italian rolls are included!!  Everything was enjoyable."}
{"text":"Average Italian food in a small Strongsville strip-mall.

Went here recently (for lunch) with a co-worker.  Service was prompt and attentive.  Ordered the lunch-portion of chicken parmigiana (my go-to Italian dish) with spaghetti and a side salad.

Their version of sauce is too sweet for my taste (I prefer a much more vinegary, bitey flavor), and the pounded-thin and fried breaded chicken cutlet was a tad on the dry side.  Portion was very generous, but the overall flavor missed the mark for my palate.  Salad was pretty standard-issue, but the accompanying bread seemed to be fresh and homemade and was quite good.

For a reasonably priced lunch this restaurant was just fine, but nothing spectacular or special."}
{"text":"Good place, casual atmosphere. Decent spot to bring the kids. I haven't eaten here in a couple years but will come back soon."}
{"text":"As far as Danielle and I are concerned, i think we're split on The Italian Village. It's not that she dislikes it, but i definitely like it more than she does. 
We stopped in last week again and I realized I hadn't written my review the last time we'd been there. So, here it is. 

Slaves to habit, Danielle and I seem to get the same handful of things no matter where we go for Italian. For Danielle it's either Eggplant Parmesan, Chicken Parmesan or pizza. For me it's Chicken Parmesan, spaghetti and meatballs or pasta a la vodka sauce. Here, Danielle had the chicken parm and I had the penne a la vodka w/ sausage. Danielle's chicken was good but she wasn't blown away. i tried and it and thought it was alright. my penne was good. i honestly don't like Italian sausage in pasta or on pizza but here it just works. the creamy sauce and the slight bite of the sausage are a combination i go to again and again. and i look forward to going back for it again. I also like to order  side of meatballs because I like meatballs. there's are good and that's all you need to know. 

There's one other Italian restaurant between here and there, but we ain't goin' to Bianca's. nope, We both agree on that."}
{"text":"I've given this restaurant several tries to win my business but their food just seems to fall short.  My husband gets the cavatelli and says it's okay but he's not raving about it.  Once I had Manicotti and it seemed very floury and heavy/bready versus a pasta noodle. Maybe that's what the traditional is supposed to be like?  But I was kinda weirded out by it and it was just ok.  Inside the place was actually pretty nice.  I was surprised for a restaurant in a strip mall.  I wish I liked their dishes more since the price is pretty reasonable for Italian food especially compared to J Bella."}
{"text":"love this place, we've never had a bad meal there. Every time we decide to try something new we always end up saying that we should have gone to the Italian Village. They will make special items, all you have to do is ask. I love their Carbonara that they have on special once in a while, wish they would put in on the menu so I wouldn't have to special order it.  Great service always also. The owners seem to always be there, not just standing around but working in the kitchen etc. very hands on. Keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"Solid Italian fare. Love the bread and the eggplant parm. They cut it thicker than pretty much every place I've ever been to and that gives it some substance and more flavor. Good pizza too. The service is always excellent. Have never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"Had a nice dinner for 2 at Italian Village. Food was good and service was fast + friendly.

There was only a 3 minute wait for a table. Soon after we were seated, our drink orders were taken. Service was pretty speedy as the bread basket, salads and appetizer came within minutes of each other. The entrees took a little longer to arrive, but it wasn't a problem as we were enjoying the food already at the table. 

We didn't know there'd be a bread basket, so we ordered garlic bread with cheese for an appetizer. It was very cheesy + garlicky + good.  Our house salads with house Italian dressing were very good + tasted fresh. My husband thought the dressing was \"too oily\" but I thought it was fine. 

For entrees, we ordered the Shrimps Melissa and the linguini with baby clam sauce. Both were very tasty. The portions were pretty big and we were happy to have leftovers. 

We didn't order any fancy drinks nor dessert. Our bill came to about $45. We also had a Groupon which took the bill down to $20. 

The decor is simple, nothing fancy, kind of like a smaller version of IHOP or Perkins. Other diners were dressed in t-shirts, jeans, shorts so it's nothing formal.  The restaurant is at the end of a small shopping plaza, shared with a Mediterranean market + a party supply shop. There is plenty of free parking. 

Our waitress (I don't know if she mentioned her name or if I just forgot) was very friendly. As mentioned before, she had the drinks, salad, bread and appetizers at the table in good time. She also kept us updated about our main dish from time to time. Used plates were removed promptly. She also packed our leftovers, which was a nice touch. The only deficiency came after our entrees arrived: no one came by to ask how they were or if we needed anything. It wasn't a big deal as we really didn't have any concerns really (other than maybe extra napkins would've been helpful). We were also given refills of our drinks (non-alcoholic) without us having to ask for them. Super! 

[From other reviews, I saw that this is a family-owned small business. I think I heard other diners being greeted at the table by management but no one came to our table. ]

Overall, it was nice place for dinner for two."}
{"text":"Italian Village has good food, but the atmosphere is rather unappealing. It seems outdated and crowded."}
{"text":"This is average Italian restaurant.   The first problem is the sauce is plain red tomato sauce. There were no obvious seasonings present.   They have ready good fresh bread! 

I ordered lasagna and it had nominal ricotta and mozzarella cheeses.  It was ok.  Not bad, not good, not with a second trip.   Now, mom got ravioli and again plain red sauce.   Basic food but at $25 for two average meals there's better places abd better tastes."}
{"text":"My girlfriend's favorite restaurant and my favorite Italian restaurant in the area. Always friendly staff and reasonable prices. She loves the Chicken Marsala. \"One of the foods in heaven.\" I like the al dente way pasta is served and the fresh bread.  Chicken Parma sub is good for a quick lunch. Eggplant is also good. Not cutting edge cuisine, but just very good food."}
{"text":"I ordered carryout and it was phenomenal.  Food was great and portions were large, came with salad and some delicious sesame bread.  As an Italian I appreciate the made from scratch alfredo sauce and the hospitality. 
 They were extremely busy but very friendly to me and my 2 year old.  Delicious, I'll be returning."}
{"text":"Really good bread and the Chicken Marsala is awesome. They gave us free roses on Valentines Day! Cosmo was delish.  Very friendly service."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite places to go in Strongsville! I go at least every other week. Food is delicious and the staff is amazing! Family Italian restaurant at its best!!"}
{"text":"Really good! I've never had a bad meal at this place, and I've been coming here since I was younger :)"}
{"text":"I have been eating here for years.  I drive 20 minutes to get here each time and it is always worth it.  

I love the homemade Italian salad dressing, the fresh baked bread, the eggplant parmesan, and the chicken fettuccine alfredo (minus the mushrooms, gross).  My husband loves the BBQ chicken pizza and the chicken parmesan and he is super hard to please when it comes to red sauce that isn't his Mom's.  

They always have a great selection of desserts, which are made locally (although I don't know where), but generally I am too full by that point to even consider dessert.  

All in all, great place, great staff, great food, worth the drive every time!"}
{"text":"First, we were pleasantly surprised by the inside of this restaurant. It is in a small strip of stores and looks like it will be a little, old restaurant. In fact, it's a good size and very clean! 

We had cheesy garlic bread, which was delicious. I ordered eggplant parm, and I really enjoyed it. My husband ordered the penne w sausage in vodka sauce, he didn't care for it at all and sent it back. He then ordered chicken parm and he liked that much better. The bread that comes with dinner is yummy too!! 

It was our first time here and I would come back?"}
{"text":"Nice meal. Family friendly atmosphere. I was able to have an enjoyable worry free meal with my 2 year old. I liked that the owner was stopping by checking in on patrons."}
{"text":"Long time customer. Food was decent now plain lousy. Recently ordered dinner to go and was so disappointed. Pasta was almost red from absorbing sauce, meat was old tasting not spoiled just far removed from fresh food. Called them. Lady said she recognized my name that I was a regular and wanted me to talk to owner. Asked me if he could call me back because he just walked in. Never was interested enough to call me back. I am not interested now in ever going back. Too bad they were so close to home. Customer service does not exist here."}
{"text":"The food is good, place is clean, service was a little slow.  I had the sausage and peppers and the table shared the calendar for an appetizer.  Both kids found menu items they liked.  The overall experience didn't disappoint or blow me away, kind of fell right in between."}
{"text":"1st time eating here & I gotta say I was very impressed .. the food was fantastic but the hi-lite on this particular visit was the service .. not realizing how late it had gotten on this particular Saturday nite & not knowing they closed at 10pm we arrived at 9:20pm .. I first apologized for not realizing the late hour & asked if it was ok to be seated so late .. we were welcomed & made to feel very comfortable .. was wondering how the kitchen staff would feel about preparing last minute meals (gotta admit that we were not the only patrons but certainly the last to arrive this evening) but the food all came out freshly made & wonderfully presented .. from the appetizers to the salads to the entree's it was all wonderful & we will definitely be back .. although try to arrive a bit more ahead of closing time .. big compliments to the staff .. they took very good care of us & made a perfect 1st impression to our party of 5 .. all of whom never dined here b/4 .. great job! .. great food .. highly recommended!"}
{"text":"So as far as the menu/food/prices go, I'd say 3 stars. But because of certain parts of the atmosphere and the absolutely delightful staff, I'm bumping it up to 4 stars. The food was very standard Italian food, but at slightly high prices. There was this incredible mural on the back wall, while other parts of the restaurant seemed a bit outdated. Like I said, the service was really great, so there's a chance we'll be back."}
{"text":"We really like it here! I always get the linguine w/clam sauce, never found another restaurant that makes it worth ordering. Hubs got the shrimp Melissa and raved about it. The salad is delicious, wish they gave more cheese like they used to though. Bread is so good! House wine was awesome!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  We eat here at least twice a month.  Great pasta, pizza, salad and bread."}
{"text":"Such a classic Italian gem!  Really good food, clean and family style atmosphere.  Everything on the menu is great, even down to the dessert!

I usually get the chicken Alfredo, and split some mile high cheesecake.  I've never had a reason to complain about this place."}
{"text":"Checked this place out tonight based on a few reviews and curiosity. I understand that everyone's experience dining is going to be different, but there's no way anyone that's eaten here can say this is good authentic Italian food and if they do they've never eaten real Italian. 

I ordered meat and cheese ravioli mixed... 2 meatballs and we got an order of \"garlic bread\" The red sauce looked and tasted like condensed tomato soup out of a can that you mixed with too much water, no seasoning whatsoever and personally I couldn't tell the difference between the cheese and meat raviolis. 

The meatballs were definitely balls of meat, but again no flavor giving any indication that they were Italian style meatballs, more like \"hey here's some ground beef, toss it in the microwave for 5 mins and see what happens\". 

The garlic bread was ok, not good not bad just ok. 

The only reason I gave it 2 stars is everyone there was very nice. I feel a little bad trashing this place because it feels like a family restaurant, but not so bad that I would bother going there again."}
