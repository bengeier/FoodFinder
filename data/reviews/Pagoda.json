{"text":"I ordered rice with broccoli and chicken here and the lady serving me didn't even fill up my tray. If you buy food like this outside of campus at any other place, they always fill most of the container with the food. But this lady filled up like maybe half of it. Half a container for $10 and $3 for a drink is not worth it"}
{"text":"Fast food Chinese place located at Student Centre at York.
Their selections are usually the same everyday.The same Chinese food you get at food courts.
They also serve wonton noodle soups.Just ask one of the workers and it will come out piping hot from the inner kitchen area."}

My rating: 0 stars.

How could you butcher the egg roll? Walmart egg rolls are better than these flat empty flappy thingies. To this, I say NO! And NO to your over-battered ridiculously-small chicken dish..dammit I forgot the name (was it General Tso? Kung pow looked awful too)

anywho...only eat this food if you plan to throw it back up. OR - go ahead and eat and regret your choice for life!!

Where to eat instead when you're stuck at York: 1) \"The Islands\" a couple doors down has great lunch deals, and 2) Indian flavour restaurant. These places offer the next best thing to a home cooked meal. And that lassi @ Indian flavour?? to DIE for!"}
{"text":"If I could give ZERO STARS I would. The manager is completely unreasonable to allow for the customer in front of me to get sauce added to their meal for no extra charge but for me he wanted to charge me. The lady serving me was more than willing to accommodate my simple request but he felt the need to actually argue with me! There were no customers behind me so he was in no rush whatsoever. I told him I no longer wanted to give him my business and he discarded my order into the trash BUT waited til he thought I was out sight and instructed his staff to scrape the food back into the serving trays! I have video of them doing this and will be filing an official sanitation, health and safe food practice complaint. Do not eat here."}
