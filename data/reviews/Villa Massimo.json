Le prix reflète la qualité de l'expérience."}
{"text":"We had a party of seven, all ordered something different and everyone thought their plate was the best. From Osso Buco to swordfish to vegetarian lasagne, we all shared tastes and all agreed it was excellent. 

The service and menu knowledge of the waiters was excellent. Not to mention the owner who walks from table to table chatting it up.

We enjoyed everything about this restaurant.

{"text":"Surprise to have such a nice Italian restaurant hidden in la Prairie. Great wine selection, very homey decor. The tomato sauce almost as good as my Italian wife's cooking and very friendly service from our waiter. A bit pricy but definitely worth to return for special occasions."}
{"text":"Je fréquente le resto depuis un certains temps et il s agit d'une des meilleures  tables de la rive sud. La carte des vins est sublime et le service hors pairs. La salle a l'arrière est tout simplement a couper le souffle. Tous sont sympathiques!

Attention: les prix élevés, les portions qui ont rétrécit dans certains cas. Ne pas laisser le serveur choisir votre vin en lui donnant un prix."}
{"text":"Went to Villa Massimo twice and was satisfied both times. The seafood risotto was perfect. The service was great. Loved that old school Italian feel. The only down side is it is waaaay to expensive. Sure, all is good but you can get food like this in the city for half the price. 
But seeing that there aren't many places like this in the south shore, for a romantic evening without having to cross any of the bridge traffic, it's worth it.
So, go and mangia, mangia!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem of Italian experience hiding in La Prairie.  Decorated with wine bottles, this restaurant feels almost like a home. This is a bit pricey, but you are getting your money's worth. I started with a delicious Caesar Salad, then for entree had their house made Gnocchi.  The Gnocchi is served in a wine sauce with Gorgonzola cheese. Fantastic. Coffee was good. 

Five star service, wonderful staff."}
