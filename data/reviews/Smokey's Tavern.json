{"text":"Came in here on a classic drive around with my friend looking for dive bars during the week. Found this ...? Gem ... Well could be a classic dive smoking allowed which I like if you don't I wouldn't come it's like a salmon smoke house in here . Came In around 6:45 for happy hour got a beer .50 cents off $1.75 for a bud heavy pint good deal. Service is lacking tho wanted to get down on the special of .50 cents off again but bar tender is just talking with the locals paying no attention. O well got a nice heavy shot of of Yukon jack for $3 not bad but have been sitting now for 10 mins waiting for another beer and there's no one else here but the exception of 1 bartender ( seems sad ) and 2/3 -( hill billy : city type talking about how much their insurance is on their ATVs for the year) now there talking about the TV show naked and afraid and still waiting to close out the tab because we used debit. Not getting the welcome Pittsburgh vibe or any service for that matter. Started the rating at 3 because of the cheap drinks and relaxed atmosphere but down to a 2 because just getting straight ignored now. Peace yinzers"}

{"text":"Favorite chill spot since my boyfriend and I moved to Millvale. Sometimes the smoke can be a bit much (I know, the name, but still) but it's got the most reasonable prices and most down to earth people ever."}
{"text":"Dive! An older bar that's clean and smoke free. Very much a little local dive which is a-ok with me. Prices are cheap and staff friendly. What more could you ask for? I'll definitely be back."}
