{"text":"Worst experience of restaurant ever, without even eating! We waited for an hour for the food to come and the waitress (who did her best by the way) was embarrassed to tell us \"your food is coming soon\" until the manager of the place came to tell us that \"they ran out of tape\" which means nothing. She never ever apologized and told my husband \"to lower his voice down\"! As a manager this is not acceptable to say that to a customer who had been patiently waiting for one hour and not even talking loudly.   So we decided to leave the place and the manager never ever apologized for not serving us our food!  At least they should learn from this comments to apologize and compensate the wait of customers by offering bread, chips instead of having their customers waiting clueless and hungry. Too bad because this place looked promising!"}
{"text":"Came for dinner first time was pleasantly surprised! The restaurant is very nice, clean and friendly.  The service was excellent, but most important great food!  Fresh hot and delicious!  Will be back soon"}
{"text":"Literally the best food ever. I'm OBSESSED! I recommend the mish mosh burger or the stuffed pepper appetizer. The service is as fantastic as the food is!"}
{"text":"Never eating there again. Waited almost an hour for our food. Then two were sent back. Owner was apologetic but not accommodating. She needs to learn how to make customers happy. She blew it. This is my first bad review of a restaurant. Horrible experience."}
{"text":"If you are in the beachwood area and want to avoid the sea of chains and have some home cooked feeling meals, this is your place.   This place is a mash up of bar, nice restaurant, and local art gallery and it just works. The main attraction is the food, from escalates bar food to full steaks they do it all amazing, and I can't recommend this place enough. Mish.Mosh.Sandwich"}
{"text":"This was a good find. Behind American Tavern. Not crowded but good crowd at the bar. Small but has a nice patio. The menu is also kinda small but it has a decent amount of variety.   3 of us went. Got the Pumpking on tap. And ordered the cavatelli with meatballs and sausage. My family got the lobster mac n cheese. And the paida fungi which was the special. It was like a mushroom flatbread. All good. Everyone liked their dinner. And we were full. Portions decent.   Met the owner. She and her family relocated from Connecticut and bought this restaurant cuz that's what they do. She told me. LOL! She is originally from CLE. I like to know about the personal stuff. Makes me want to eat there more.   Definitely go back. This one is worth a try."}
{"text":"This is a diamond in the rough. Another don't judge a book by its cover. I've driven by dozens of times and really never thought to go in.   Not sure why today was different but I now regret my delay. It's a really tastefully decorated huger end bar which you would never guess walking up to it.   The menu is great as well and it's hard to choose from so many great items. So we asked our server for help and she was both very knowledgeable and helpful.   The food is fresh, never frozen. Its homemade and delicious as evidenced by all 6 of us clearing our plates. In fact we all already have our orders ready for our next visit. I would highly recommend the Italian wedding soup to start. It was worth the calories.   I'm going to say that this is likely the best dining spot in this general area which true, there is not a ton of choices, but this truly is a gem and deserves a stop."}
{"text":"Seated immediately, nice beer on tap selection, friendly staff.  Nice selection of food without being a 5 page menu. Very accommodating waitress, my husband didn't like the beer he ordered on tap (we are new to the area and just learning the local brews).  She had no problem trading it out to one that she felt would be more to his liking, even brought a sample out.  Filed green salad with homemade blue cheese dressing, food was fresh and fast to come out.  Steak was FANTASTIC!  Tender, flavorful, perfect medium. Lots of meat in the pasta, moist meatballs.    Place was full but not too noisy.  We ate inside (husband hates bugs).  Definite repeat!"}
{"text":"Last night my husband and I were able to get a table for two without a reservation. It is not a large place and fills up fast! They offer a couple local IPAs as well as the usual beers and wine. We liked the mushroom quesadilla and meatballs with hot cherry peppers for appetizers. For entr√©es we enjoyed chicken and sausage and egg plant Parmesan with fresh homemade pasta. I really recommend the pasta! Everything was made really well. We will definitely be returning with friends!"}
{"text":"Good food, and drinks.   They Attempted to provide a good experience for their customers but was very hesitant when we were paying our bills. We asked if we could do separate checks and our server said of course when we started ordering but when we were about to pay, all of our checks were messed up. The server (flustered and annoyed) then said that she will NEVER do this again, that tomorrow will be a new day. It made us feel pretty shitty because it wasn't our fault! She said it wasn't at all a problem-- something happened behind the scenes(she forgot, she lost her pad of paper with our order, change of servers....)  Maybe I'll give them another shot, with a smaller group, only because the food was great."}
{"text":"Finding a great little local spot is the fun part of travel.  This place does it right on so many levels.  If you have the opportunity - go with confidence..."}
{"text":"I like 50/20 for lunch. They have a nice selections of soups, sandwiches and pizza. It's a very casual environment and it's operated by the owners. That's nice. They Do there best to keep you happy. They have a private parking lot on the back so parking is never an issue. I come here probable once a month. If you are in the area you should try it out!"}
{"text":"Thanks for the amazing food (had chicken fingesr)!!!   From,         Luka"}
{"text":"We were visiting some relatives in the area and they suggested we try this place on the way out of town. SO. GLAD. I had the best chicken of my life and my wife had the best flatbread of hers.   It's an eclectic place: sports on the TVs and Basquiat-inspired art on the walls and a complex, interesting menu that would be right at home in NY, LA, or Europe.   I wish we'd been in the area longer so we could have explored the menu but now we have a reason (uh, ya know, other than family) to go back!"}
{"text":"Had a great lunch with friends today and the service was great, food excellent, and the atmosphere is always great. I've seen some rough reviews about Bar 50/20, and I have to question those, but it's the restaurant business in the world of social media. It's rough out there.  We all had the Friday fish special and we were pleased with the food. Great flakey Cod with awesome slaw and fries. A couple of important bumps in the road were; first a little high price for a fish sandwich at $13.75for fish sandwich and chips, and the wait time for the food. It was a pretty clear staffing issue. Manager and one server working service, with what appeared to be two in the kitchen. Both were delightful and friendly, but when a small restaurant gets hit this hard (20 ppl in a small restaurant during Lent in a heavily Catholic area, plan a little better).  I've never had anything near bad food at Bar 50/20, and now its successor, Mish Mosh which is the official name of the place. They're a small independent restaurant that I like. Give them a try. I'll give five stars even though there were some rough spots. It's 13.75 for a great fish sandwich. Go to McD's if you're looking for 2 fish filets for $4. I like that option sometimes too."}
{"text":"This place might be my new regular spot. Sat on the patio and had the most chill lunch ever. Our server knew a lot about the menu and the prep of the products which helped cause that means she could make recommendations we trusted. It's not a fancy place, so if that's what you're looking for go somewhere else. It's like you're relaxing at a friends place with delicious food and really cold beers. The beer selection was impressive for a little place too!   Food: Our table tried some different stuff. I would recommend ALL OF IT, cause we shared. Pizza-crust was insanely good. Salad-big portion and one of the best dressings ever(rice wine vinaigrette). Burgers-hand packed and fresh toppings, loved the bun! Fried dough balls-served warm with sauces- just delish!   Place is so reasonably priced for phenomenal foods AND they have daily Specials!! Can't wait to get back and try the pasta!! I'll update!"}
{"text":"Food: 4/5 Atmosphere/other patrons: 0/5 Service: 0/5  Went for dinner with my husband, college-aged brother and parents. Arrived at 7, and no one even acknowledged us when we walked in. We should have walked out right then.  After standing near the entrance waiting for someone to seat us for a few minutes, we asked the bartender if we should sit where we like. She said \"Yeah, that is fine.  Your server will be right over with your menus.\"  After about 10 mins, we still didn't have menus or a waitress. Again, we should have walked out then, but we were all starving and it was 7pm on a Friday so we figures we would have to wait anywhere else too.  Please note that there are a total of 3 filled table at this point in time (oours included). The waitress finally arrived and my brother couldn't quite see to the bar so he asked what was on draft. The waitress made him continue to squint/try to decipher them, instead of listing them off.   She did not write down our drink order and forgot mine as soon as she walked away from the table.  Then we waited, at least another 10 mins for everyone's drinks to arrive (2 beers, 2 glasses of wine and a coke so nothing fancy) .  At this point we were about half an hour into the dining experience and have yet to order, although we all knew what we wanted after being in the restaurant for a short period of time.  After our drinks were received, we then sat for another 15 mins before our waitress even came back to take our order.  We ordered 4 pizzas, 2 appetizers and a salad.  Then the waiting continued.  Our waitress didn't check on us once between the time we ordered and the 45 mins it took to get the appetizers.  In total, this was a 2 hour dinner, and not because we lingered, we scarfed down our food in about 10 mins after it arrived.   At some point while we were actually eating, one of the strippers from the Crazy Horse down the road (I knew she worked there because her jacket said \"Crazy Horse Dancer\"), came into the place, took over the jukebox and started grinding on a 60+ year old man in the middle of the place.  At the end of the night, our waitress asked how things were, and we indicated the food was good but that service was slow. She said the kitchen got \"slammed\",  I'm not sure how, because again there were 3 tables when we arrived.  This place 's only saving grace was the food. It is a shame that I will never be back, they are doing themselves a disservice with their staff."}
{"text":"This is a nice neighborhood place to eat.  My first time here and the decor nicer than I was expecting. We ordered the fried ravioli, which was very good.  The pizza was awesome, not quite NY Style, but thin and tasty, I wish you were able to get a pie bigger than 9\".  I had a chicken park sandwich...I expected a chicken breast, but it turned out to be a large chicken tender on a glorified hotdog bun...it was small and underwhelming at $8.00, but very good taste. All in all the prices are cheap, but expensive for the quantity.  Friendly service, and will return, but just not while I am really hungry."}
{"text":"The new menu is fresh and really tasty! Prices are reasonable and atmosphere is friendly. The Italian wedding soup and pizza are delicious! Really nice change from the chain restaurants. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Honestly I didn't even know this place was there until I saw some of the reviews. Super attentive service, very eclectic menu, with a menu that leans towards Italian dishes. The only thing that I can even possibly complain about was that the salmon was a little well done, it's the only thing that prevented me  from giving 5 stars."}
{"text":"I don't think we had a dinner at our table that wasn't delicious. I had the Bento Box (Salmon). Even after great appetizers I couldn't help but finish my meal.  Try this place...I know I will be back."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. the service was spectacular. I had the pork dip and it was amazing."}
{"text":"As a previous reviewer said, \"if I could give 0 stars, I would\". Had a very bad experience this past Friday evening. Went for dinner waited over an hour for our orders....watched all the other tables being served. Even a large party of 8 that had been seated after us was served their meals. We were a party of 4 and only ordered sandwiches, nothing exotic. My husband told the server we'd been waiting an hour and she appeared annoyed and never returned to give us any updates or status on our orders. After a bit, he went to talk to owner at the bar. She just told him she saw our food and it was coming. She eventually came back to our table and did hear our concerns but just continued to tell us our food was ready and being \"plated\". Needless to say our meals never came. No apology from anyone until we got up and said we were leaving. Then the owner said, \"Well I'm sorry then\". Never going back."}
{"text":"My business associate & I stopped in here for dinner on our trip. I was a little hesitant because we were in a slight rush & the place was a little busy, with only the bartender waiting on the whole place. We sat at the bar & Jamie took our drink order immediately! She was an absolute delight. She gave us recommendations & even went out of her way to make sweet tea for us despite the business. Jamie told us the husband was the chef, who also owns I believe 4 other restaurants, but I still knew she may be biased on the recommendations. But no, everything was delicious! Very fresh ingredients & homemade sauce. Hopefully I'll be back to Cleveland soon & come have another meal. Great food, great service, great energy, an excellent experience"}
{"text":"We went to Bar 50/20 on a Friday.  I was a little late joining and my party had already ate when I got there.  It seemed there was only one woman serving tables and the bar so the service was a little slow, but we were in no hurry.  The server was nice despite her running around.  I ordered the Lobster Bisque and a Side Salad with the house dressing.  Both were good however the Lobster Bisque was a little spicy.  It would be nice if this was mentioned on the menu incase someone can't take the heat.  The beer that I ordered was very poorly poured and the temperature of the bar was a bit too chilly.  There was a lot of foam in the glass.  Overall, I feel it was a nice little place, but need some work to make it a bit more homey."}
{"text":"Bar 50/20 is a rare gem. This classy local establishment offers a tasteful atmosphere with impeccable flavor. The owners often have a presence behind the bar and inside the kitchen, ensuring skillful flavor and great service is the standard. Great taste (music included)."}
{"text":"I stopped into Bar 50/20 the other night to meet my parents for dinner. This has recently become my stepmother's favourite place in that part of town. It was 1/2 price burger and chicken sandwich night, so I was leaning towards one of those. We ordered a plate of their Provolone wedges for the table to go along with our beverages and I was stunned by the size and quality of this starter. The cheese was beautifully coated in a hearty crumb and deep-fried. It was accompanied by a delicious sauce, which I discovered was homemade.   That quickly put the kibosh on my sandwich order because I had to have something with that incredible red sauce. I ordered the eggplant Parmesan, which came with a generous portion of cavatelli. My stepmother got an order of the meatballs with a breadstick. The meatballs were succulent and didn't have either a rubbery or mealy texture. Dad got the burger and it was quite substantial and included a generous amount of toppings. My side salad was nothing remarkable, but it was your standard restaurant side salad. I wasn't there for the salad, so I can gladly report that everything ordered was incredible."}
{"text":"This is now operating as Mishmosh.  Food is mediocre and portions are small.  The owners are nice and have good intentions, but their inexperience   doesn't predict success.  The place was virtually empty, but they managed to get one of our orders completely wrong.  Service is amateurish and this place's future is bleak."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how you could not like this place. Nice little restaurant bar that you could tell has been fixed up a lot lately.  I came for a  mid afternoon lunch and a beer and the young lady behind the bar  was very nice and helpful. I ordered a hamburger and , wow , it was one of the best burgers and fries I've had in a long time. Very fresh and you could tell it was all handmade,  not a frozen patty. I can't wait to get back to town on a business trip to come try this place again and check out other items on the menu"}
{"text":"Excellent service and the food was equally impressive. I had the chicken and it was very flavorful and yummy. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"What a cool little place! Very good food, friendly prompt service. Out of town and will be back!"}
{"text":"Visited last night for the second time in a week. Had one of the burgers which was super delicious! Reminded me of a great restaurant in New Orleans called Port O Call which was highly recommended from a local. First time I've found another burger that good.. French fries came with it which were the perfect amount. Not too many and not too little. Bartender made good suggestions for the beers on tap. Friendly service, great food. We will be back for more!"}
{"text":"2nd visit this time with the whole family. Rare for us to all find something we want. My duaghter got lobster Mac and cheese. We all taste each other's meals the Mac and cheese was yum. And as evidence of how we enjoyed it was the only thing we brought back home. I had a fish fry, I really liked it, Howard even made cocktail sauce for. My 12 year old son is a pescatarian and he got a dish he didn't like they gladly took it off the bill. My wife got a burger and downed it all. Usually she'll bring 1/2 home. The owners Howard and Jamie make sure the experience is good. Thanks"}
{"text":"Affordable and delicious food. Don't pass this place by. Good food selection and artist interior."}
{"text":"Intimate place; great menu, service and food. Everything that came out from the kitchen looked amazing!  Locally owned and operated; they do care what you think and make sure you are happy!  Will be back on a regular basis.  This will be my new \"Cheers!\""}
{"text":"Bar 50/20 has become our go to place on Tuesdays!  1/2 off pizzas on Tuesdays is a fantastic deal, with most of the pizzas priced between $8-$9 (the white pizza is our go-to). The soups are great as well with several people saying it's the best Italian wedding soup they've ever had. Much like the other reviews I'll say the lobster mac and cheese is the best thing I've had here. Cheesy, rich, and huge chunks of lobster makes it worth a try. The bartender/waitress was super friendly, but it's easy to see she can become overwhelmed when they are busy."}
{"text":"If I could give it no stars I would. Had the longest worst meal ever. My brothers rare burger came out well done. My husbands pasta was cold. My sister-in-laws dinner salad had 3 shrimp. I still hadn't gotten my meal. We waited for our meals for over an hour and a half. Jamie, the owner, tried real hard to make it right. But still we were very disappointed in one of our favorite spots.  My husband said (very nicely) he thought they should do something about our bill. They deducted my Diet Coke. We're done. Never again."}
{"text":"Solid dining experience - went on a Saturday night and called in advance for a reservation - ended up with a nice warm table in the corner of the restaurant, overlooking the happenings in this intimate restaurant.    Service was 5 stars, family owned & operated (chef's wife was our primary server).  Very friendly, maybe not the most buttoned up service experience (a few small confusion points with salad orders), highly attentive.    Food was a solid 4 - decent prices, comfort food type options, so maybe not so healthy but delicious.  I tried the soup of the day (super creamy tomato) and a mushroom piadina which was just OK.  People with me ordered salad (homemade dressings!), bahn mi, and lobster Mac, all highly enjoyed."}
{"text":"Great local restaurant and bar. Owners and staff are pleasant and make you feel at home. The food here is really good, so much more than bar food. The owner, Howard, is a real chef and knows his stuff. Small, but attractive, dining room. Nice little patio to sit on during nice weather. Stay away from all the chains, and support the local guys!"}
{"text":"This place is quickly becoming one of our favorite places to go. The food and service are impeccable. Although they don't have a kid's menu, they overly accommodate them and make the kids feel welcome."}
{"text":"We live right around the corner and drive passed every day but honestly never thought to try it. One night I was craving a burger so decided to give them a call for pick up.  I told her I couldn't find the menu online so we read all the burger descriptions to me! It was so sweet and I really appreciated that she took the time to do that.  The burger and fries were very good too.  We ended up going back with friends a few weeks later and sampled some appetizers and enjoyed everything.  Thought it was a bit expensive but the customer service is top notch!"}
{"text":"Awesome spot! We stopped in one evening as the kitchen was closing. The waitress seated us quickly and encouraged us to make dinner choices. She then went and gave the kitchen the heads up that there was one more order for the night. They were very pleasant and the food was great. Oh and they make a mean lemon drop martini!!!! Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Here's an insight from a former (not bitter)  employee.  The place is ok. The bar is nice.  The dining room is,  meh!   Nearly all of the food is from frozen. The pizza dough is freshly made.  The sauce/marinara & meat sauce is house made (from canned ingredients).  The owners are not restauranteurs. It's a hobby for them.  They don't treat the staff as well as they should. They overburden the kitchen staff. Expecting a $12/hr cook to cook,  prep,  wash dishes,  clean the entire kitchen,  bathrooms,  dining room & bar floor. Do the inventory and all manner of miscellaneous tasks.  Joe Pasquale (a co-owner) is as arrogant as they come,  he thinks he's a wise guy. He also thinks he's a good cook,  he isn't. If a good chef works there,  Joe feels threatened and will undermine them. He also likes to (joke) about shooting you (when he usually has a gun on him), nice huh?  They keep a loaded revolver under the cash register!  It's an ok place,  if big head Joe would butt out!"}
{"text":"Good food and Great Company.....    Daily specials.....  Fun people....   Great service..... Good looking staff......."}
{"text":"Great little hidden gem of a restaurant. It has changed ownership in the past 6 months ( I say this just because the menu listed below is no longer current)   Saying that the current menu (we found on Facebook) is still excellent. We had the mish mosh burger and the turkey handheld (it was like the best parts of thanksgiving between two perfect crusty slices of bread. The cranberry mayo was superb. The menu has a great range of selection and there is something for everyone. I really loved and appreciated the range of ingredients they offered.   Great beer and cocktail lists. Very small and intimate location and one of the owners was there and waited on us. You can tell how passionate they are about there restaurant.   I will absolutely be back and cannot wait to try more items on the menu! Very Reasonable prices and good portion sizes. A new favorite in the Solon area!"}
{"text":"Very good food and great service. My wife and I ate dinner there tonight it was fantastic she had a great burger I had the steak sandwich all came with great homemade fries. They have a great bar and nice patio. The restaurant is very clean and comfortable.  We definitely will visit again."}
{"text":"A local establishment doing the dining and drinking experience right.  The owners have figured out the fine balance between lunch stop and dinner experience.  In addition, they are on site, attentive, and friendly.  I've been here at night to eat and drink beer, and I've been here in the middle of the day with customers.    Mish Mosh Burger seems to be the go to burger (or chicken sandwich) and I would have to agree. They do use top quality ground meat, and they cook it the way you order.  Fries were a good side, but the star is the burger.  Also had the Pork Bahn Mi and it was something I don't normally make at home and was what I expected.  The side salads are a little pricey for the size, but that's for you to decide.  The location is somewhat hard to find, and the building is rather nondescript, with low roof pitches and an unassuming exterior.  Despite that, it's what's on the inside that counts, and I did not come away disappointed."}
{"text":"The reviews were good so I thought I'd try this place for lunch. Would have liked to eat outside, but it was too hot with the sun directly on the patio. Had a pepperoni & onion pizza with ice tea to drink. The pizza was well worth the drive and the tea was even better.  Staff was quick and friendly, all over a nice place to go."}
{"text":"Great, unique food - good prices. Friendly staff, nice ambience. So glad yelp pointed me here so I could avoid the chain restaurant sports bar near by. Polpetti meatball plate was delicious."}
{"text":"Great pizza every time! Holds up very well, even the next morning after reheating- still a crispy crust! The Italian wedding soup is homemade and has chunks of chicken in it- perfect if you are not feeling well. A wonderful neighborhood standby for pizza!"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to try this place for a while.  We showed up at 6:45 and found out the place was crazy packed and we didn't have a reservation.  They were sweet and apologetic, and as we were almost to the car, they ran out and grabbed us, as they realized someone had bailed on a reservation.   Happy to have a table, we sat and studied the menus.  They had a lot of interesting items to try on the menu, but we went with some of the items I had read about on other reviews.  We ordered the MishMosh Burger, the Prosciutto, Mushroom, Garlic Blanco  Pizza, and my daughter got a chicken parm sandwich.  All three came out fantastic.  The burger was great, the pizza was very tasty, and my daughter loved her sandwich.  The fresh cut fries that came with the sandwiches were spot on.  The reason I gave this place a 5 star rating was the service.  They couldn't have been more accommodating, they couldn't have been more attentive and they couldn't have been more friendly.  We will def. be back to Bar 50/20!"}
{"text":"Bar 50/20 is easily our favorite bar to go to! The food is FANTASTIC to say the least. They have daily specials that are always so creative and yummy. The owners are wonderful.. great wine & food menu... you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite local bars. Just to clarify, I'm not a barfly or even much of a drinker. This is one of those bars that is truly better known for their food then their beverage.  Bar 50/20 is a small business that is run by its owner. While, I won't add his name here, this man cooks the food you are being served. To me it's like quality assurance. If the owner is actually running their restaurant, he/she will care what comes out of the kitchen.  I have never had anything mediocre here. Everything is fresh and super tasty. Just to give you an idea, there is a fresh kale salad, wild mushroom flatbread, eggplant parmigiana, and various meat dishes for all. This is not you standard bar menu loaded with fried food. It's way more creative  During my last visit, I ordered the eggplant panini. I was craving one of those since I saw a show on food network about eggplant parmigiana. The eggplant panini from bar 50/20 did not disappoint. I highly recommend this creative place for your next casual meal."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  We stopped for lunch because of the high ratings on Yelp.   We were not disappointed  All scratch made to order.   The food was wonderful It was fresh and  hot.  The service was friendly and welcoming.  This little gem will now be one of our favorite spots"}
{"text":"This was a great find while in the area on a business trip. The outside is deceiving. The inside is awesome with good music. But of course, the main thing is the food. It's different and amazing. I had a Bahn MI. An unusual sandwich on a crispy roll.  Genuinely friendly staff too. They also have regular fare as well, burgers, pizza and entrees but with their own freshly prepared, specialized twist. When I got the bill, which was very reasonable, I saw that they are now Mish Mosh - Eclectic Eatery and Spirits. Makes perfect sense."}
