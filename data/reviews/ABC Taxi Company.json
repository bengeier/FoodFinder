{"text":"Called at 230 on a sunday afternoon for a pick up just west of downtown. I called back to confirm if a cab was dispatched and the receptionist said he would be there in 15 minutes. I was ok with this. 25 minutes later I get a text saying did you call a cab. I called and he said he was ten minutes away still. Called receptionist back and she acted like it was my fault when they were the incompetent ones and the cab just never came. I was 40 minutes late for work. Awful people and service."}
{"text":"ABC needs to learn how to be where they say they'll be on time AND they need to keep their customer's information straight.  I never write yelp reviews, but I was so astounded at how terrible my experience was with ABC. I called 2 hours before I needed a cab (at 8:30 to the airport), the lady answering the phone was very friendly and took my address and assured me a cab would be there.  8:30 came and went, it's now 8:50 and I call saying I'm nervous I'll miss my flight - the same customer service woman says my cab is now 3 minutes away, maximum. I thank her and wait outside.  9:05 now. No cab. I call and say I'm going to miss my flight if the cab isn't here now. Customer service woman proceeds to blame me - she asks my phone number, I give it to her and then she says no I gave her the wrong phone number (they never asked for my number earlier) and recites the one I \"gave\" her (completely different from my phone number) so the cab went to the wrong place. I tell her no, I've never heard of that phone number (and even so, what does my cell number have to do with where the cab goes???). So I give her my new number and say I need a cab immediately (I'm slightly upset now since my cab is so late), she hears the frustration in my voice and says angrily that she will notify quality control and then HANGS UP ON ME.  I have a friend come pick me up and take me to the airport, going out of her way and barely make my flight. On my way to the airport I receive a call from the customer service woman and she yells at me that my cab is sitting in the driveway and called me twice. No. The cabbie did not call me, he called me the made up number that you somehow mixed up with my appointment. Thanks for nothing ABC. No apologies were ever made for a 40 minute late cab TO THE AIRPORT. A PLACE WHERE ARRIVAL TIME MATTERS."}
{"text":"What is the point of making a reservation if you can't keep it?  Walk, jog, bike, fly, rapid...before you use this cab company...  We made a reservation fully 6 or 7 hours before the event we were attending. The dispatcher assured me that I was smart to make a reservation, and that the cab would be there, and call me when he arrive.  Not. After waiting for 15 minutes after he was scheduled to arrive, I called, and told the woman about my reservation.  I am going to keep this short: The woman told me that my reservation on this busy night meant nothing, and that I should try and hail a cab on my own.  Need I say more...?  I will gladly swear under oath that this happened..."}
{"text":"I can't speak for the actual cab service, but every cab company I called was unavailable. ABC at least answered their phone and when they told me they had no available cabs - they suggested another cab services to try. That's CUSTOMER SERVICE! That operator just sealed the deal. They'll always be the first place I call now."}
{"text":"I was coming home from the airport and had originally planned on taking the RTA then walking the mile to my house from the RTA stop.  When we landed I saw that it was pouring rain, so as soon as the RTA left the airport I called for a cab and said I would be at the stop in 15-20 min.  I got there within the time frame and waited for 10 min - no cab.  I called, and the dispatcher said she would radio the driver.  I waited for 20 min - no cab.  I tried calling back twice, and no one picked up.  I have no clue if the caller number shows up, but if it does then that was seriously poor form to ignore my call.  I finally gave up and ended up walking home in the rain.  Will not use this company again."}
{"text":"I went to a formal event at the Wolstein Center and our taxi driver was very prompt. We changed locations of the pickup and our driver just went with the flow. He was very polite and an excellent driver. I was so impressed with our service. I will be using ABC taxi again in the future."}
{"text":"I noticed an ABC cab in University Circle today.  I've tried calling now 3 times just for some information, I don't even need a cab today, BUT NO ONE ANSWERS!  Can you actually believe a transportation company wouldn't answer their phone at 2 pm in the afternoon!  Don't use them, obviously!"}
{"text":"This was a terrible experience. Called at 4:00p to have a cab by 5:15p, called back at 5:30p and the said the cab was dispatched. The cab driver called at 5:45 and said he was stuck in traffic, and asked if the cab was still needed.....arrived at 10 min to 6:00p with coffee in hand and asked if we had to be at the airport at a specific time; the cab was filthy, cigarette boxes were everywhere and I thought he was drunk! Will NOT use again!"}
{"text":"Came across an extremely rude ABC Taxi driver on W. 25th today in car 6062. He cut me off while he changed lanes suddenly in the middle of an intersection. When I honked to let him know I was there, he stuck his arm high out the window and flipped me off for four solid seconds.  Someone doing that in their personal vehicle is soon forgotten, but he was representing a company with the name right there on the van making purposfully offensive gestures and violating traffic laws."}
{"text":"If I could rate in the negative's, trust me I would. This was the worst taxi service I didn't even utilize. I called at 9:00am to be picked up from my job at 3:00pm. For background this is when I take my lunch. I was advised someone would pick me up. I was at work and someone continued to call me at 2:00pm. Since I was at work I could not answer immediately. I called back 10 minutes late when I was able to. It was the taxi driver. He stated that since I did not answer, he would no longer pick me up an was now heading in another direction. I was not instructed by anyone that I would need to verify this pick up. I would have gladly called them to verify. I instructed the driver, I understand but how are we going to solve this issue I still need to be picked up and you are no longer coming here. He advised he couldn't do it and he would call the office to have them see if someone else would come pick me up. I agreed. 10 minutes go by and I call the office since I did not yet receive a response. When I advised the woman who I way she immediately retaliated \"he called you several times and you didn't answer.\" I advised her that I was at work and I was not advised to verify the taxi ride otherwise I would have called sooner to verify. She advised that he was already heading to a different location at this point and no one else could get me. I asked how long it would take for the  originally driver to come pick me up since I still needed a ride. She was very snippy with and advised that if she sent the taxi I would have to wait. I advised that I understood I just needed to know approximately how long it would be. She rudely stated well you didn't answer your phone. At this point I got fed up with the rude remarks. I told her you do not have to be rude. She retaliated verbatim, \"I'm not being rude, but I also don't have to send you a taxi.\" I was appalled at the lack of customer service. I was furious and I missed my lunch do to handle this incident. I advised her you are absolutely right. I no longer need your services. Never have I been spoken to in such a manor by a business location. I immediately called another taxi service that was very helpful."}
{"text":"ABC just committed what, in my mind, is the mortal sin of taxi companies. Despite having called the night before to make a reservation for an early morning ride to the airport, they called me ten minutes prior to scheduled pickup to let me know that they didn't have any drivers interested in my short 10 to 15 minute ride. I had to scramble to find another cab and barely made my flight. This stressful situation obviously could have been avoided if they would simply have been a little more honest with me the night before. Absolutely horrible customer service."}
{"text":"64 months later. I'm starting to think they just aren't coming. My hotel bill is astronomical now. Why won't ABC call me back? I just want to go home so I can see my family again."}
{"text":"Wow. I typically go to yelp before hiring any service but made a huge mistake on this one by not doing so. Called yesterday to make reservations for a ride to the browns game today. No show!!  no Aplogies either. Is this really a taxi company or a front for something else?? Soooooo, here we sit, waiting on another company to pick us up. abc said they could have someone here in30 minutes..........GTH!!!  Aaaahhhhhhhhhhh!   Missing kickoff, the price I pay for choosing this loser company."}
{"text":"Just a tip..if you need to be somewhere on time do not use this cab service! We had to call to adjust our reservation and waited 30 min the second time we called...then just got in another cab since it was so late..not good to wait in Cleveland in Feb!"}
{"text":"I've only tried ABC once, but they did three things that Ace Taxi (by its many names) has never yet done for me: a) they showed up exactly when they said, b) they charged what they said they'd charge and c) they took a credit card without a problem. (But note: no Discover.)  They gave me an impression of being smaller and less \"advanced\" than Ace. (No automatic text alerts; credit card taken on paper, not a swipe machine.) But even so, they did the job more efficiently than I am used to, and they arrived exactly on time in spite of bad winter weather. The driver even called twice: once an hour before my scheduled pickup to make sure he knew how to find me, and again five minutes before. That's being organized, even without the on-board tech. (They did have a GPS to get around, of course.) Ace sends a text saying a cab has been dispatched... Neat! Except when no cab arrives.  I'll use ABC again, and fingers are crossed that this good experience was not a fluke."}
{"text":"I'd give them a 0 if I could. Called for a taxi to the airport after my car broke down. Never bothered to show up. Tried calling back, phone just kept ringing and ringing. Wish I had checked this site first to see others had had the same experiences. Not just bad company, freaking fraud! Don't even understand why, seems to just be to make people's lives worse since they don't ask for your credit card number or anything. Do. Not. Use. You'll regret it."}
