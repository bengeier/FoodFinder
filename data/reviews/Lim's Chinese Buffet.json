{"text":"Dirty, bugs, surly staff....then the food - gross chicken surrounded by gobs of greasy syrupy breading......we used to go here years ago and thought it was decent for what it was - a little cheap chinese place in the 'hood....but this time all we could choke down was the hot/sour soup...won't be back."}
{"text":"Was a go to for cheap chineese. That was until i observed the owner pick his nose while he was eating his lunch. He then continued to ring out customers, including myself. Never again."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst place I have ever been to. The $8.50 (9.23 with tax) that I paid for was not worth it, there was a small buffet line with limited choices and mostly breaded and fried. I tried the egg drop soup and could taste plastic. Same goes for the fried rice and chow mein. The chicken were too sour. The fried fish was greasy and the chicken, too. The two types of sushi that were there weren't even tasty. The deserts (cookie and donut-type) were horrible because they weren't even sweet or appetizing. I'm never coming back to this place and neither should you. They call it an all you can eat with bad food and there's no shrimp and NO SEAFOOD AT ALL. Sucks."}
{"text":"Disgusting. Typical cheap, dirty, greasy Americanized Chinese food. Clean your damn restrooms! Chicken thigh meat in the chicken and broccoli. Hot and sour was pure barf. Dark."}
{"text":"I drive past this place everyday on the way to school. My husband and I had a craving for some (a lot of) Chinese food so I decided we should check this place out. First off let me warn you, it's pretty scary looking on the outside, and where I sat on the inside too. But the food was enjoyable, especially for the price. All of my dishes were hot, except one but it didn't bother me too much. The Chinese fries were to die for, and everything else was just what I wanted greasy delicious I ate so much I have to unbutton my pants buffet food. Not four stars, definitely bit five stars, but a solid I would come here again 3 stars."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm even giving this place 1 star is cause it's the lowest I could go, if you care at all about your health you will never dine here. yeah it's super cheap but you get what u pay for, garbage"}
{"text":"Hidden little gem! Felt welcomed from the moment we walked in. Very friendly staff and the place is clean! Everything on the buffet line looked great! And the two ladies behind the counter where doing a wonderful job making  sure everything was in order. You can tell the Owner(s) takes pride in their buissnes. Especially since I heard they have been opened for years!!!!!!! ...........Very reasonable prices too!!!
I'll defiantly be back with my family!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here for 15 years, but the food is still of good quality, the same family is running it, and the prices can't be beat.  In the whole world of Chinese restaurants is this a 5 star, no.  In the world of $7.95 buffet in the ghetto, for sure!  There are plenty of bad one's, just a few that are worth going back again. Thanks Lim's for keeping it the same."}
{"text":"What is it about the anonymous Chinese buffet that draws me, like a moth to a flame, knowing full well that I will be disappointed?  I suppose the 2 or 3 good experiences I have had, ever, at any Chinese buffet, anywhere, have spawned within me an eternal optimism - that I will stumble into a beautiful buffet table full of home-cooked Chinese food, tasty and tasteful.

In reality, it seems that 98% of Chinese buffets serve the same stock dishes, with varying levels of mediocrity.  The orange chicken here was actually tasty; everything else was greasy, super salty, and, sometimes, lukewarm.  There were about 8 dishes total, with the usual fried accouterments, plus the worst sushi I have ever had in my entire life.

If you are desperate and pressed for time, this place will do - otherwise, avoid, and spend your $7 somewhere else."}
{"text":"good food.reasonably priced but the most foul smelling dirtiest rest rooms you can ever find !

i hope they add more items to their take-out menu as choices are few and gets to be boring at some point."}
{"text":"I got sick for three days after eating here and they refused to give us our money back."}
{"text":"\"Don't judge a book by it's cover\"!  Well your momma always told you this growin' up and it still holds true today for this little gem.  From the outside this strip mall is a little run down, but don't let this fool ya.  
 I have personally been going here for twenty-four years, and the food has always been consistently  good. In fact their sesame chicken is probably the best in the valley.  
The atmosphere inside isn't fancy/stuffy but instead warm and inviting.  The staff is attentive and friendly, and has been owned by the same family for twenty-five years.
The neighborhood and cliental have changed over the years but a good value for your money hasn't ."}
{"text":"Another hole-in-the-wall good Chinese buffet restaurant.  If you are looking for a lot of ambiance and variety - this is not the place for you.  If you are looking for good food with value then you are at right place.  The French fries, egg rolls, sweet and sour pork and broccoli chicken are great.  Soup and crab puffs are good too.  Not a fan of the hockey puck egg foo young.   Very clean and well lit. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Definitely a \"hole in the wall\" place but the food & service was as good as anywhere else."}
{"text":"Been going here for 22 years.  The people are the same the food is the same, but the restaurant itself has improved over the years. It's cleaner and nicer although the decor is pretty much the same."}
{"text":"Not going to be going here anymore.  Didn't feel like cooking or going out so me and the wife chose to order some take-out.  I ordered 2 large boxes and thought it was awkward that the ladies dish up your food when ordering to-go.  I quickly found out why.  EXTREME RATION CONTROL.

I asked for sesame chicken and was given literally 3 pieces.  I asked for more, because this was going to be the only meat I wanted.  She then put a 3-4 more pieces in the box.  By the end of the bar I had a barely past half-filled box.  This cost close to 10 dollars!  

I had accepted my fate, but then I saw another lady preparing a to-go box in which she filled it to where it almost couldn't close.  Seeing this I asked the lady boxing my food if she could throw a couple hot wings into one of the box and a chicken teriyaki piece in the other.  She told me, \"no that's all you get\".  Confused. I asked why the other boxes, prepared by the other lady were so full.  She told me, \"you tell me you only want sesame chicken that's all you get.\"

I then told her I wanted a refund which I was given but was treated horribly while she was giving my money back telling me I was greedy, and she didn't care if I didn't come back.  Easily one of the worst experiences I've ever had as a customer.

Do yourself a favor and go to Noodle and rice, the food is better and the service is spectacular!  For a fast option, you'll get way more for your dollar at a panda express and it's about the same quality."}
{"text":"At the age of 6 i was diagnosed with diabetes.. I am now 20 years old and i eat at lims every week, just recently i visited the doctor and he told me that i was cured of diabetes. Lims can create miracles and is yummy"}
{"text":"I've been going to Lim's since I was a little kid (almost 40 years) and seen many generations of the family running it come and go. They've always been kind, the food has always been the same, and I will always come back for that nostalgic feeling for as long as they are open. I still have the mother of pearl chopsticks the original owners gave me as a child. I know that this place may not be what every person is looking for in a Chinese restaurant, but it is a great place to me!"}
{"text":"This is the greatest dirty Chinese Food in Phoenix, nay anywhere! I have not been proven wrong yet.

As a customer experience, it is deeply flawed. 
- Yes, the staff is rude. I have seen them argue with customers before. My uncle was once kicked out for eating too much (to be fair, he is really fat). 
- Yes, the bathroom looks like something out of the scariest of scary movies. 
- Yes, the staff will bitch at you for asking for too much of a given product on a take out plate. 

However, the big thing here is FLAVOR, and I have not found a tastier place. Just haven't. Trust me, I've tried. I would love to have this restaurant with amazing service (and it would be so awesome I would never leave) but that is not a reality I can attain unfortunately. 

For now, I'll get reprimanded for asking for too much Crab Puffs and enjoy the bliss that is overindulging in amazing dirty Chinese Food!"}
{"text":"There are lots of reviews about the service being rude and horrible. I found the exact opposite. We went in with a 20 month old who decided about a minutes and a half in that it was time to be pissed off. At everything. Loudly. It was bad enough that if there had been people sitting around us I would have left. Luckily, the side we were on only had one other table of people who were wrapping up as we got there. Even when he was screaming maniacally, when the staff walked by, they smiled at him. They also slipped him a baloon. 

The buffet is small with a limited selection. Nothing was bad. The sesame chicken I got was pretty greasy, but based on other reviews of it being really good, I'm willing to chalk it up to being a bad batch due to the oil being too cool since the orange chicken was not greasy. The sweet and sour pork was very lightly coated before cooking which made it different than most places. The egg rolls and hot and sour soup were the stand outs for me. 

I don't know that i will rush back, but I won't avoid it either."}
{"text":"Small buffet, but my family loved EVERYTHING we had.... even ironically the french fries."}
{"text":"If you're looking for 100+ food choices, waterfalls, sculptures, beautiful scenery, wifi, etc.. You might wanna keep moving.

But if you want a cozy mom & pop Chinese buffet, pull up a chair here..! For a Chinese buffet, there aren't too many choices, but what they do make is excellent compared to some places I've eaten at.. Best fries in the Desert, just one of their fries looks like 5-7 fast food fries lumped together and deep fried, they are that massive and delicious!

The sesame chicken has a \"shell\" on it that is solid, but not rock hard.. It's more like a delicious crust on it..

The price is awesome as well, only $7.25 for Dinner buffet (drink is $1.75 extra) per person.. Less for Lunch buffet.."}
{"text":"We moved to Arizona a couple years ago and had been searching for a decent small Chinese buffet ever since since those mega buffets are ALL terrible. We live out in Surprise but will actually make the drive all the way over to Lim's if we're in the mood for Chinese because it's simply THAT much better than any of the dozen or so other places we've tried since moving out here. No, it's not some life changing experience but it is easily the best in the valley. Thank you for having actual egg rolls and not the spring rolls that are passed off as egg rolls at 90% of the other valley eateries. Even if you're just in the mood for wings you can't go wrong here. It does look like a dive on the outside but the interior, although dated, is quite clean. Ditch the mega buffets and get some legit Chinese buffet food. Go to Lim's!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding mom, and pop Neighboorhood Chinese resturant! The food was amazing at this hidden gem"}
{"text":"The BEST fries in town! All other items are very good, everything is fresh and hot which is a plus @ a buffet. Been here for over 20 years, they must be doing something right."}
{"text":"I been going to Lims for more than 7 years. Their food is delicious. They have the best fries,orange chicken,rice, crab puffs and chicken wings In town. It's also super affordable and the waitresses are always super nice . I highly recommend to take your family here ."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday night which should have been them giving their best foot forward.  There were like three things that weren't gross beside the rice.  Gross.  The bathrooms were fowl.  It was $38 for one adult and two kids.  DO NOT GO!!!!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for decor and ambiance go elsewhere.  If you are looking for an abundance of choices on a buffet, go elsewhere.  

If you want a quick and easy meal and you live in the area, this could be a go-to for either sit down or to go.  

We noticed a fair amount of customers took it to go.  I don't blame them.  There isn't much to this place, but then again, it's a mom and pop place not a chain that has tons of cash to blow on decor.  

The next day you may inevitably regret eating here, but I think that's pretty consistent with an Americanized Chinese food places where MSG may possibly be a main ingredient.  

Overall Score: B almost minus"}
{"text":"Honestly just get past the low class look & feel, and this is a good local Chinese restaurant. I've been going here since I was 3 or 4 and I'm gonna keep going here every once in a while for as long as I can. It is family friendly, affordable and decent for its state."}
{"text":"Based on the better than average reviews for Chinese buffets in the area, we decided to give this place a try. Clearly it is a dive which we do not mind at all as long as the food is good. The food was awful. Everything on the buffet had clearly been sitting there for who knows how long and the selection was pitiful. The chicken was so dry I kept thinking of the scene in Christmas Vacation when the turkey explodes into dust when they cut into it. We sampled pretty much everything they had to offer on the buffet and it was all terrible. Even the sodas were watered down. I'm baffled at the average and up ratings that others have given this place. We clearly weren't expecting 5 star out of a dive but this was pathetic."}
{"text":"Lim's buffet is the best Chinese restaurant in town. Yes it's true they might have a small selection on food but everything they offer is delicious. My family and I have been coming to this location for over 17 yrs, best Chinese food you won't regret it if you go"}
{"text":"If you're a pot-smoker, then you can relate to this.
Even if you don't smoke pot you'll still relate.

You're hungry. 
No, you're starving. 
A sudden onset of the munchies so pronounced, you're willing to eat almost anything. You pour through the fridge searching for anything, but all you can find are some leftovers from weeks ago, whose vintage looks now resemble a science experiment. 
You know you'll hate yourself later, but God help you...you've got to eat something. Anything.

In your shark-like eating frenzy, you microwave the orange colored shit, setting the timer for double the time you normally would, reasoning how the extreme heat should kill off any new strains of life-threatening diseases.
You go to sleep afterward, and later awaken to the feeling you've just done something horribly wrong. 

If you've ever experienced that feeling. That cathartic moment when you ask yourself; \"why did I just do that?\"
You'll experience it at least one more time if you eat here.

There's another reason I don't like this place.
The server, upon noticing how my plate resembled a chicken-bone graveyard of sorts, unceremoniously and very swiftly demanded I eat 'moh vegtubul'.

I don't care for places where the server scolds me like my mother used to. 
If I want to dredge up those memories, I'll go to a shrink, not Lims."}
{"text":"My daughters friend brought a container of the sesame chicken from Lim's Chinese Buffet to the house.  The wonderful smells of the chicken were too much to withstand, so I decided to have a piece.  Before I knew it, my boyfriend and I finished the entire container.  We are still not sure if it was the embarrassment of eating someone else's food,
Or the desire to find more chicken, or both, but we were drawn to Lim's that very instant.

When we got there, we found a wonderful buffet.  Not only is this the best sesame ever, but the service is outstanding.  There is a women behind the buffet bar who always makes sure it's stocked with new and fresh items, especially the chicken.
Her voice, yelling for more chicken, is almost as enjoyable as the food.

I strongly encourage you to run not walk, to Lim's.  We were there again last night and will
Probably be there today."}
{"text":"Great food been coming for a few years. My grandson loves it. especially the servers. 
and the price is just right!"}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by its cover. I went with my friend who immigrated from Asia and swears by this place. It's very good and extremely cheap for being a buffet. I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"If you want all-you-can-eat Chinese food, Lim's Chinese Buffet is the place.  It's been my local favorite since I was a kid, as this was the quickest and easiest place for my mom and I to dine.  Who can pass up all of the Chinese food you can fit in your gut this fast?  Lim's offers the unlimited buffet all day long or you can dine right off their menu for food made-to-order.  A large take-out plate is only $5.65 plus tax and that gets you everything on their buffet line except the drink.  If you'd rather pick and choose, be sure to let the know when you pay and they are more than happy to let pick the items you'd like.  Lim's is the best little Chinese food place in Northeast Phoenix."}
{"text":"Okay the food here is tasty. It's a hole in the wall small Chinese Buffet.... I read some people's comments on how this is horrible food but yet,  I looked at their profile and they rate Panda Express as one of the best experience, LmAO...... At this location they have some of the best sesame chicken I ever tasted delicious Fried Chicken and cream puff. If you're ever out for a little drive in this area &  feeling hungry try out this place for yourself.. ..."}
{"text":"We were looking for a different chinese place but when we got there it wasn't open yet so we gave this one a try.

This is an older place, kind of a hole but I noticed that the staff was cleaning the entire time we were there. The waitstaff was friendly.  The food was ok, it wasn't exactly good but most of it was edible.  $7.25 for the buffet on the weekend but I think it's cheaper during the week, $6.25 or something like that was on the sign.

2 drinks, 2 buffets came to $19 and some change.  

I wouldn't really recommend this place, they didn't do anything \"wrong\" but they don't do anything right either."}
{"text":"horrible, never again !!! The food is either over or under cooked the chow mein has no taste whatsoever the rice is stale ,chicken is over battered over fried , took 1 bite down and your mouth gets filled with oil. Oh Yeah and the customer service  RUDE AS FCK!!!"}
{"text":"I really can't recommend this place unless you like minimal choices and and over cooked food. There are literally like 10 items to choose from. They do not look appealing. The pork was too salty. The egg roll was burnt. Very messy as well. If I were you I would find somewhere else to go."}
{"text":"I used to love the food, the place itself is usually unclean and the service horrible every single time. I stopped going when my boyfriend and I went for lunch and he bit down on an egg roll and almost broke his tooth! There was a ROCK in his egg roll. Disgusting. We told the lady there that always drags her feet and she offered us $5 off.. Um no we did not pay for his meal. We shouldn't of even paid for mine. My appetite was completely gone. Never have gone back. Oh and they don't accept discover card but have the discover on the tab."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for almost 20 years! The selection is slim but all you need. They have the BEST crab puffs EVER! They have these thick French fries that are the best I have ever had! I know all the employees there. They know my family and my kids and even ask about my kids when I go in there alone. I usually take food to go and NO, they are NOT stingy. Good price, good food, great service!"}
{"text":"I'm still not sure what to think of this place. It seems sketchy on the outside and on the inside. The food was decent at $7.50 a buffet plate at dinner, but it's because they don't have much of a selection. Their French fries are nothing I have seen before- good, but deep fried oddness. The seaseme chicken had a maple syrup taste to it. They seem to have also a side of the resturant besides buffet where u can also order regular Chinese dishes. They have a few cute trinkets for sale for cheap!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for ages. So my family and I are regulars here so I can safely say its an ok restaurant. If you're looking for a high end Chinese place this is not the place for you. 

However if all you want is a bite to eat on a budget this is your place! The sesame chicken is awesome, a bit too sweet but good. Their hot wings, fried rice, fried chicken, chow mein, and egg soup are my favorites. Some of the dishes are very greasy and you sometimes feel like you're bringing spounfuls of MSG to your mouth, that's why I have not eaten here recently. I find myself craving Lims less and less, unlike when I was younger and would crave it all the time. 

The place is not very clean and I am guilty of having seen critters around (another reason I hardly eat there anymore). The employees are also rude most times, and I think its because they're tired of all the crap from so many years of business. Haha. 

In the end its an alright restaurant for those days that you just want greasy Chinese food. But don't come looking for exceptional food or service. I'm giving it 2.5 stars because its not too good but not too bad."}
{"text":"BARF BARF BARF

Quite possibly the grossest food I have ever eaten.  The chicken lo mien was made with spam-ish meat product-- Does that make is Spamish meat product lo mien? I ended up eating just white rice and soy sauce with egg rolls--- can't mess up fried egg rolls right?  I did have to salt them though, they were pretty taste-less. 

The ambiance is less than desirable as well, our plates never got cleared and the amount of unshowered people sitting near me made me want to go home and take a hot bath with all the soap in the world.  

I will not return to Lim's and I suggest you not go either."}
{"text":"get a large box to go and it feeds the whole family! the food isn't the best quality Chinese food obviously but it's not bad! we always get an extra small box of sea same chicken which is probably the tastiest dish here"}
{"text":"Lim's Chinese Boofay is a throwback china boofay.  If you want seafood and spring rolls and vegetables and no MSG, you'd better head elsewhere.  If you remember going to a china boofay in 1979, back when nobody knew or cared that Chinese people never eat this stuff, and you loved the kitschy decor and salty fried food, then Lim's is your place.  I'll bet that the recipes and decor are the same as they've been for the last 30 years.

You've got your requisite fried rice, lo mein, beef/broccoli, sesame chicken, sweet&sour pork, egg foo young, eggrolls, fried chicken, and maybe a couple of other items beyond that.  Everything was cooked not so bad as far as the consistency on the Crispy-Greasy Spectrum, but had so much msg that my mouth literally had a buzzing feel when I left.  Not a taste, a FEELING, left over from the monosodium glutamate infused cuisine.  Blech.

The Discard Pile was actually tiny for the sesame chicken, but instead of honey it was flavored with syrup--cheapass imitaion ''maple'' corn syrup.  Still, I must admit it was lean chunks of white meat chicken, and was my favorite if I had to pick a poison.
S&S pork looked lean, with large chunks of nonfatty meat, but the insides were a little gristly, and each bite in had about 20% come back out onto the Discard Pile.  Seems like they tried to keep it lean, though.

In the entire boofay table, there was hardly any color from veggies.  All I found was some icebertg lettuce and coleslaw in the cold section, plus brocolli in the beef&broc, carrots and onions in the S&S, and some white cabbage and a few onion pieces in the lo mein.  That's about it.  Oh, the egg rolls had cabbage inside, too, and Are the old school thick skinned, bubbly deep fried and mushy, not the spring roll thin skinned crispy kind.

Lim's had some decent flavors and I created a small Discard Pile, so could be a 3Star boofay by getting rid of the msg, using honey instead of syrup on the chicken, and adding a bunch more veggies into the mix.

$6.25 lunch ($1.50 more for a soda) was not worth it, no matter how much volume you shove in.

Still buzzing from the weird msg high.  No sir, I don't like it."}
{"text":"Honestly REALLY good!  Small selection of items, but hot, fresh and tasty!  Have only ate in, but looking at the to-go containers that are $8.50 it's a steal, they PACK them full of whatever you want, and it's not by weight.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Went here the other day.  It happened to be a Friday, and I noticed on the outside there was a sign saying there was sesame chicken and golden fried fish on Fridays. Jackpot!

Not your typical buffet line, more like cafeteria-style, but you still serve yourself.  There is a sign at the beginning of the buffet lecturing you to eat everything you take, which I didn't see until after I had gone through once and had a small mound of dry, dry, dry fried rice on my plate that I didn't touch more than twice.  It really wasn't good.  The hot and sour soup was also a pass.  It tasted like nothing - just spicy and bland.  I added some soy sauce but it didn't help.

Several other items made up for this though.  The sesame chicken was GOOD, still crispy somehow, and white meat, really sticky.  I enjoyed it, even if it seemed more like a crispy honey chicken to me.  The fried fish was also good, they had some tartar sauce at the end of the line.  I liked the teryaki chicken with its sauce, and the lo mein (why are people saying it's spam? it was definitely chicken).  The fries were also great, clearly homemade but good and crispy. I'll probably go back here, especially if it's on a Friday."}
{"text":"ICK.  My friend suggested eating here only because were were seeing Dream City church Christmas Musical 1 mile south of Lim's.  NOTHING tasted worth going back for another helping.  Most every thing was breaded and fried, to fill you up real fast.  
The soups were awful, bland and boring.  Pork chops were all hard and dried up, like jerky.  
Chicken wings were too sour, I wish they would coat the wings in another flavor and offer that as a choice, too.  Sesame chicken had a lot of pancake-like breading but the chicken inside was decently tender.  French fries had the breading too. I left all the breading on my plate and ate the inside.  

Eggo rolls were awful too, bland and nothing but tasteless bean sprouts inside, no meat, not enough salt, and the wrapper was soggy.  I did not use the red sauce you are supposed to dip it in because there was no little plastic cups for the sauce, and I did not want to make my plate and the food in it, all red, like my friend did, ladling it into my plate.  

I consider myself buffet queen, and this is the worst Chinese buffet I've ever been to.  Service was minimal, she just removed our plates, nothing rude about that.   She brought me the water I wanted with 2 thick and meaty substantial lemon wedges on the glass, like I had asked.   The two lemon wedges were the best thing in the entire buffet.  

Price went up from the $7.25 mentioned in the reviews, to $8.50.   I would not want to eat here for free.  ICK.  I guess I am \"Chinese\" and have a more discriminating tongue, but we only ate here cos he knew I liked buffets and we wanted to be in neighborhood to make sure we beat the traffic to make the church Christmas program and be on time for that.  Hardly anyone in the restaurant at the sit down tables during the time we ate there, which was on a Wed at 5:30 - 6:30.

Their sign outside was faded (it was red), blotchy, missing paint,  and in need of a repaint, just fixing the sign would brighten this place so much more.  Can't believe it stayed in business for so long.  I think it is due to the line up for take out by mainly the Mexicans in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The buffet choices are rather limited but the prices reasonably reflect that limitation. 

However, the food choices they do have are very good as is the service. My main criteria for service at a buffet is that drinks are refilled and used plates removed in a timely manner. 

I've been here several times since I moved to the area and will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"I love coming to this old spot. When I am craving sesame chicken this place is first on my list and I really like their hot and sour soup. They also make a spicy pork chop that I enjoy too. Never disappointed when I come here."}
