{"text":"Great to see so many seafood options available especially in this area. It's title is clear as to what you can find. And yes all of it is fried I asked. But better to feed your gluttonous blerp here than at a conglomo. Looks like they are set up for pick up orders mostly, but it is a great place to find lunch. They sell wings in quantities if 150 pcs. And they fry fresh! It didn't smell like brunt oil and the place is clean. Employees are friendly and local. I had the smelt with fries and potato salad. Very home style delicious. The fries are crispy and steamy hot so be careful. The smelt was just a bit chewy, but they were small fillets. Also sodium intake is a bit high if you are trying to stay away from it. In conclusion....go here."}
{"text":"Fresh fried, largeish portions. The fries are thick and complexly crispy. Zucchini plans were pretty big and very tasty, particularly with the savory lemon seasoning. Canned and bottled beverages available, including novelty soda.  The folks who helped us were very pleasant, attentive, friendly community folks. Will definitely be going back, possibly phoning pickup orders in ahead of time."}
{"text":"New ownership means terrible food save yourself the trip. Sad because the place was good. Cooked in old grease, wings looked like bat wings. Again make your own stay away"}
{"text":"I adore this place. Having grown up in the south this place gives a nice spin on my favorite foods. It is a little on the expensive side, but the portions are generous."}
{"text":"I hate to give any independent restaurant trying to eek out a living a bad review, but here we are. There's no two ways around it. Visited 3/12/17 and ordered the chicken/cod combo with fried okra and potato salad. Following the cue of another Yelper, I ordered everything batter fried with their in-house powder seasoning. Big mistake as I did not care for the seasoning at all. It was applied very heavy-handedly and masked the true flavors of the items - including the friend okra! One of my fish fillets was not cod - it was definitely something else and was not light or even pliable. Everything was dry, dry, dry. Dried out fish, dried out chicken, dried out okra. The french fries included in the meal (bread as well) were just okay. The potato salad was ultra-bland with little to no seasoning. Not worth eating, either. Husband ordered chicken wings (also came with the in-house spice blend liberally applied) and said they are just okay. He would not get them again, but he will at least eat what he received today.  My entire meal was in-edible and thrown away. Ugh, what a waste. Probably the worst meal I've had in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I'm a local, so I suppose I'm a little partial for neighborhood businesses, but Pittsburgh Fish & Chicken is certainly a great option if you live in Brighton Heights or you're just passing through after work with a hankering for fried.  You're mainly going to find all things fried, with the exception of a few individually packaged desserts and waffles (which accompany the Chicken & Waffles dinner special), but fried is what they do well here - with a mildly spicy, lemony dusting of their signature spice blend.  Avoid the fries (unfortunately they are not fresh-cut) and the sandwich version of any of their fried offerings (the buns and accoutrements are second rate).  Yes, the place is a little shabby looking, but the cooks are friendly enough, and lord knows we need more local business, and dinning options in particular, in our proud neighborhood.  Try the ocean perch, catfish, or the chicken tenders, which are surprisingly awesome, even for an adult palate.  The best bet is to order ahead and have your fried feast waiting for you."}
{"text":"I'll keep this short and sweet. Best fish sandwhich in pittsburgh. one of the best I've had anywhere in the country. the large is the size of a football. try it!"}
{"text":"Definitely will be coming back on a regular basis. We stopped in and got the Friday special Fish sandwiches with fries and coleslaw and the portions were fantastic and the food fresh and fantastic. We did both catfish and cod. New favorite for sure."}
{"text":"It was better with old owners. But still pretty good. If you want some wings that taste home cooked this is the place together then. Brings back some childhood memories."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh Fish and Chicken great \"no-frills\" take out spot for perfectly crispy, hot, fried food.    Highlights were the Pittsburgh classic: fish sandwich - available in large and small. They allow you to choose your fish from 3 or 4 types - we had cod, and let you choose your breading (batter or ?) - we got batter. They give a huge portion (3 or 4 large pieces on the large) on a crusty (but not hard) roll. Comes with great fries - those ones with the extra crunchy coating.  We also got the fish \"platter\" - same idea just no bun, cole slaw, fries, and sliced white bread.    The service was gruff, short and sweet - \"Whatcha havin' hon?\"   Everything is fried \"to order\" and boxed up piping hot which was excellent. Get it home quick so it stays crispy.   They will ask if you want it \"with seasoning\" - i took a risk said yes without hesitation. Im glad i did - the seasoning was a little salty and tangy like salt and vinegar chips. Totally right.   The menu is very large consisting of almost all fried food. The potato salad was a welcome side, tart with pickles and hard-boiled eggs (an old school touch).  Got a slice of carrot cake too which was decent.  My only wish was that they made their own sauces - the tartar sauce was not good and the cocktail sauce was the kind in packets. A nice touch would be a lemon wedge - always goes nicely with fried fish.   In terms of the chicken options, quite a few people ordered wings while i was waiting for my food so they must be good.  I didn't see many \"classic\" fried chicken options - like southern style whole pieces but i could be wrong.   Overall we were very impressed with this local spot and can't wait to try more of the menu when in the mood for yummy fried food."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed coming here but it appears there is new ownership which is not bad. But i seriously miss the previous ones. It doesn't feel the same. I think the expansion of it is nice. But it has lost its genuine pittsburghese feel that I did like about."}
{"text":"Consistently great food and it's affordable as well. My favorites are the chicken wings and crab cakes. They have quite a selection of fried food including catfish, perch, shrimp, wings, and fries along with other items so there's certainly something here for everyone. Always receive great service here, very hospitable staff!"}
