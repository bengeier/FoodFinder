{"text":"Taqueria cholula has the most authentic street tacos in the valley! I lived in Mexico for a couple of years and one thing that I miss more than anything is the food. Taqueria cholula was the one place that was able to fill this void in my life. I highly recommend the pastor tacos and the pastor quesadilla."}
{"text":"Very good tacos. Their cabeza is on point. Friendly helpful staff. Good music playing on pandora radio carne asada has good flavor. Quesadilla al pastor delicious. They have Mexican bottled coke. Can too. Jamaica and horchata as well. Good cheap food"}
{"text":"I'm giving it 2 stars because they meat is really good and has a good flavor and is overall delicious. However, the burritos look like tacos they don't put a lot of meat, which is what I mostly want. Also, they always run out of the type of meat I want when I go. If it is so popular, is it so obvious that the high demand = more need or production. They do not have good customer service and they need to remodel the interior of the restaurant because last time I was there the tables and chairs looked worn out. I really wouldn't recommend coming here. There are plenty of other good places that the food is worth the price. Unfortunately, this isn't one of them!"}
{"text":"Love-love Taquerias!  And this one has definitely made my list of local favs in Glendale area.  Simple, humble and very tasty...Its a great local find to help curb and taco jones one might have...and it definitely tok care of ours.  Love their little hot-sauce bar too with all the fix'ens....fresh diced onion, cabbage, jalapenos, and four different salsas ranging from warm to fire...YUM!    Well Done!"}
