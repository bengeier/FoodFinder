{"text":"Gotta say -Great guys doing FOOD right.  Real comfort food, awesome service, you can tell it's quality just the way the owners speak of their menu. 
I've been here a few times, pizza was perfect, sauce is incredible, steak sandwich and onion rings also spot on.  So happy, hockey season is here and just realized they offer delivery!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for food on a ride to Niagara from Toronto on the Road bike. Had the fish and chips, food was above average. Price was average, def a fan and will come back if I'm in the area. Only down fall is - no washroom, but timmies is 30 second walk away from the restaurant. 

Guy working behind the counter was very accommodating with our bikes bunked outside of the restaurant and good service overall."}
{"text":"You wouldn't think of stopping here by looking at the outside.   Small store front styled shop on lakeshore, but the gyros/donair and pizzas are spot on.  Great bang for your buck if you dont want greasy fast food. Service is great, I wish they delivered!  4/5 for take out."}
{"text":"This spot never ever disappoints! If you want quick service and freshly prepared delicious food, you have found the perfect spot!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery through JustEat. Friend and I got brutal food poisoning the next day. The meal was the only common denominator.  We had the Halifax donair and Greek salad.  Owner not very helpful when informed."}
{"text":"I love lakeside so much, I think about them all the time. Their food is really great for the price you pay -  I would suggest a gyro, they are around 5 bucks I think and they are pretty big. 

The staff is so friendly! They are very quick but pay attention to quality. I usually get the food delivered and they always deliver in a timely manner. Except Julie. She's weird and always hits on me."}
{"text":"I so trust Yelp reviews. I stopped here while on business in Oakville and the gyro was really good. I was not disappointed. The fries where made on the spot and not soggy fries that have been sitting under a light for a while. I definitely recommend this place."}
