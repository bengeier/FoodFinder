{"text":"The vegetarian platter was delicious! Generous size and a wide variety of fresh vegetarian items"}
{"text":"One of the worst Shish Taouk I had in Montreal. Chiken was not cook enough. Almost no pickled turnips and they did not cook sandwich. The potatos also lack flavor. At least they give a lot of garlic sauce..."}
{"text":"Food wasn't that great. Staff are very rude and not respectful of their business. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Pretty good Mediterranean food with good portions. The couscous dishes are pretty good, they gave you some sauces that would soak into the couscous that make them taste good. The stewed beef and the vegetables are all pretty good. Liked the baklava they have as well, not overly sweet. Service is fast during lunch."}
{"text":"I had beef shwarma. It was 11.50, a bit expensive, usually shwarma plates in Torontot are around 10$. The beef was a bit dry, the portion was huge. Salads were fresh and delicious. You have a choices of cuscus, rice and potato, all very delicious. A bit salty and oily in general, I guess that makes it less healthy and more delicious. Worth trying."}
{"text":"The food court where this place is located is bimming with good food options and it will hard to choose from all the choices avaiable.

But if you choose this out of the bunch yoou will def be treated to some good food with huge qty. I order a chicken schwarma plate whixh came with rice, potaties,hummus,garlic cream and salad.

The food was def freshly made as evident by the taste since it was different from other stuff and really good. The chicken was not as moist but not as dry either so right there. 

The price of that was around 11 canadian dollars so right there with US prices except good qty and good quality. Def best middle eastern food at a food court i have had"}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick, cheap lunch. This location is nestled in the nice food court in the mall.

We ordered a chicken wrap and a beef wrap. Apparently the beef comes with hummus and the chicken comes with another white sauce. Next time I'm gonna request the hummus. The white sauce was pretty good, though.

Because the meat is ready to go when you order, you don't have to wait long for the food once you put in the order.

You can't beat the price. Both of our meals together was under $15, which is pretty good when you are travelling through Montr√©al and have no idea where to go to get good priced food.

The wraps, by the way, were absolutely delicious. Tasted pretty authentic, especially for a place inside the food court. 

We went for lunch but we are planning to go back later in the vacation on another day for dinner!"}
{"text":"Generous helpings on the combination plate, though the chicken is the best pick by far. Great value for the money."}
{"text":"Shish taouk is decent, if your looking for authentic then I don't think this is the place."}
{"text":"I was having trouble deciding what to eat with all the choices in the food court today and went with baba. They told me that I would have to wait 5 min for the kafta (fresh!) so I opted for their daily special instead, which was a beef platter for $8.79. It comes with all the things that platters would normally have - salads, rice, potatoes, and pita. You also get a drink as well.  $10 after everything! I would prefer the beef to be a bit softer (it's a stewed beef) but I love the salads and potatoes. I would definitely visit again, as it is a convenient elevator ride down from staying at the Hyatt."}
{"text":"I'd give this a 4.5.  The food...the food!  Delicious shwarma, salad, rice and more.  I was here in 2012 and it was great then, too.  So, consistency over the years.  Great food, large portions, good prices, nice people...GO!!"}
{"text":"Don't let looks fool you. It looks cheaper than a fast food, but the food is delicious. We tried the vegetarian baba. It had three kind of salad, eggplant, pita, something with sweet peas, humus, and some more. And everything tasted great!"}
