{"text":"I have never had a bad meal at The Soda Shop.  It is a tiny cramped space and is frequently packed, and the menu is, well, modern soda shop, nothing gourmet here, but I have always found the food and service to be pleasing."}
{"text":"Awesome place to hang out or just a quick drive thru. The soda shop has a super friendly staff and amazing cookies, soda, and custards!"}
{"text":"Honestly this place seems really silly to me- especially for the price! I can mix sodas at QT for pocket change.  It has a cool cafe/hipster bar feel to it though (kudos for presentation and cute sweet staff.) which is probably why the non-coffee/alcohol drinking crowd are so excited about it. I'm not a huge soda fan myself so I tried the hot coco and it was allllriiiight.(Also no dairy free options) So, I don't really get this place BUT if you are looking for a cool hangout and like soda, go for it!"}
{"text":"Oddly enough, this is my favorite restaurant in Davidson. I go there frequently for lunch and it's always delicious. It can get crowded and noisy during lunch hour, but the staff is friendly, quick, and attentive. The restaurant has a fascinating history.  Their signature drinks and shakes are wonderful, and I love their sandwiches (egg salad, cream cheese and olive, black bean burger). Their fries are among the best I've ever had. The prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Sadly, there isn't much to say except, 'just say no to styrofoam.\" Almost everything is served in styrofoam and plastic. They don't have a dishwasher. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Great soda, Nerdy Dr. Pepper, and friendly people. Gotta give the drive through! Until next time."}
{"text":"So disappointed with our first time experience. Service was terrible. Two high schoolers behind the counter - one male and one female. My husband and I sat at the counter and planned to order desert. The two high schoolers behind the counter spent more time laughing about their customers orders than making orders or waiting on customers. We watched them make our sundaes - a nutty professor and a southern comfort - and it was frustrating. It took everything not to say something. It took them 25 minutes to make. The hot fudge and Carmel comes in a packet that they warm in hot water and then they squeeze it on your sundae. The young lady had the nerve to say that looks so bad after the young man put the hot fudge on one of the sundaes. Reminder: we were sitting at the counter. The choc chip cookie on my sundae was so stale I could have broken a tooth. Needless to say, we won't be back. It's a waste of money and the service is terrible. They need to learn how to respect their customers."}
{"text":"Classic Davidson.  Small town atmosphere with plenty of regulars.  Standard small town southern diner food.  Great place for breakfast."}
{"text":"This place has awesome soda drink combinations on an ever expanding menu! The cookies and other treats are pretty good as well. If your a Dr. Pepper fan I recommend trying the \"Leaky Cauldron\" it's amazing!"}
{"text":"The cutest and friendliest staff. The place is great to hangout with your friends or play some games with your kids. It's a place for everyone. Also, there are so many drink options. I've tried the Coke-O-Lime, Waikiki, Life's a Peach, Butter Beer, and Guava Have It. Don't ask me which is my favorite because I love them all, really!"}
{"text":"The custard here is top notch! The mint oreo its the bomb! Sodas were very creative and super tasty! I cannot wait to go back again! I think that it was totally worth waiting in the long line. I'm so glad that they brought this to Arizona and now I don't have to drive all the way to Utah just to get an awesome soda and cookie!"}
{"text":"The American classic Soda Shop.  Good, prompt food.  A local tradition.  I love the veggie burger."}
{"text":"We were so excited to try out The Soda Shop and it did not disappoint! Such a fun atmosphere and everything we tried to yummy! It won't be long before we go back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for quick chicken wrap and milkshake. Took 25 minutes to get my to go order. I am not sure how you can mess up and give no flavor to a chicken wrap. The milkshake was just basically flavored milk. What a waste of time and money."}
{"text":"The best place ever!  24oz Diet Mtn Dew with mango and raspberry pur√©e + a Rice Krispie ="}
{"text":"I like this place. I have lunch here before, and just this morning had a basic breakfast - eggs, bacon, and home fries. The first thing is that North Carolina's idea of \"home fries\" are far different from what I'm used to in the northeast. Home fries here are really stumpy-french-fries. As a result, ketchup is required. The scrambled eggs were good. You think it's hard to screw-up eggs? Try The Egg at Davidson - they'll screw them up. How do you have a place with Egg in your name, and still make bad eggs? But back to The Soda Shop. The eggs were good, and the home fries were actually stumpy french fries. The bacon was okay, but I think they may have been those microwaveable type - I had four of them, and they were each the exact same texture, length, thickness, width, etc. That's almost impossible with regular bacon. Overall, however, I enjoy the food and the coffee. I wish I could have given the place 4-stars because I really want to love the place - it reminds me of The Coffee Shop in my home town in NJ - and because it's so close to where I live, but I can't. What's holding me back is the overall quality of the food and a staff that isn't on-point. They're too distracted by whatever is going on in the back. There's not reason this place shouldn't be a go-to diner for all of Davidson. It just needs to amp up the quality of the food and the staff. I will be back, however. At least their eggs were presented to me half-raw (I'm looking at you The Egg at Davidson!)."}
{"text":"The young entrepreneurs who own the Soda Shop are friendly visionaries. I've never seen or heard of their shop being anything but superior. It's modern ~slow down~stay awhile~ atmosphere is welcoming and refreshing. VERY CLEAN~VERY TASTY SODA SHOP~ the frosted oatmeal cookies are to die for~don't bother getting it to go, you'll have it eaten before you get to your car. If you drive through ask for your cookie 1st you'll have it eaten and ordering a 2nd before you get your delicious custom made soda. I love The Soda Shop, thank you for bring some style and class into Gilbert"}
{"text":"My wife and I visited the soda shop after purchasing a Living Social coupon.  Get $20 worth of food for $10.  Overall, we were disappointed  We were not able to get two sandwiches and 1 LARGE milkshake for $20.  We had to contribute money to pay the bill.  The sandwiches and wraps were all pretty much $7.99.  I had the John Wayne and let me tell you John Wayne would have had to eat 4 of them to get full.  The Hoagie roll was fresh, but there was barely any Philly steak meat.  My wife had a chicken sandwich item and had the same result with quantity.  Not sure how the Davidson college kids afford to eat there (which is right across the street).  Maybe they get a great discount with student ID.  Bottom line....it was way over priced for the portions you received.  The milk shake was not made with high quality ice cream either.  It tasted like flavored crushed ice.  Two thumbs down.  Bring back the $2.50 hot dog with fries :-)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had just finished dinner and the dessert menu wasn't striking our fancy.  He checked to see what was in the area and found The Soda Shop. We didn't know what to expect. At first glance it looked like a Starbucks.  Nice seating area, long counter/bar.   Was a bit overwhelming but the employees are really nice and helpful to assist with your decision on what to order. My boyfriend got the Big Daddy soda and said it was really good and we shared the mint Oreo concrete which was amazing! A nice little hidden gem and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I used to nanny in Davidson for two elementary school kids who think The Soda Shop is the greatest thing since sliced bread. I agree with them in many ways. It is a really fun place to go to feel like a kid again. Their milk shakes are terrific, they have great fries, good sandwiches and of course, burgers. I would recommend the black and white milkshakes and the Shirley Temples. The cottage fries with good ole ketchup are great. They also serve breakfast which I have not had yet but I have heard its good. They only downside is that you have to wait for a table outside because it is always busy and there is no where to wait inside. Its a fun place to go when you're in the area. Downtown Davidson is adorable and its fun to go on a nice day so you can walk around after you eat."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It's a must try for out of town guests and a must do on your kids summer break! The atmosphere is cool and relaxed. They have a giant bar running pretty much the length of the store and offer tons of fun board games and card games to play while you enjoy your treats. They also have a quick drive thru option if you're in a hurry! My favorite soda is the Waikiki (made with dr.pepper) and you MUST try a sugar cookie! It comes with a healthy dollop of pink icing!"}
{"text":"I've only been here for lunch, and it was by far the worst meal I've ever had in my life, picture something worse than a school cafeteria, or a slummy ice skating arena  where everything is frozen and tossed into a microwave. If this was the last place to get a meal on earth, I would gladly let my body eat it's own fat till I perished.           .."}
{"text":"Service- great! Friendly and had some suggestions.  Sodas- yummy and fun flavors The only thing I would change is not wasting money on the cookie. Tried the chocolate chip cookie and it was like a brick. We had to throw it away.  Will return for the sodas only. Fun place for a cute date--- board games, big screen and plenty of seats."}
{"text":"Honestly their frosted oatmeal cookie is the best cookie I've ever had in my life. The guys that own this shop are the nicest guys and so welcoming. And the soda! Best flavors ever and so creative. Loved loved it! Definitely will be going back. Everyday."}
{"text":"Service has never been very good here. The food isn't healthy or anything special. Best thing about the soda shop is it's historic charm. We used to go here often years ago but now the only thing we ever get here is milkshakes for the kids."}
{"text":"The Soda Shop has seriously the best sugar cookie. The frosting is incredible, the cookie is nice and chewy. Sooooo good. I also got life's a peach drink and it was really good. The workers were very friendly and happy. Overall a very good experience. Definitely a place I recommend. #LFTHX"}
{"text":"Wonderful customer service. Everyone here is always so positive and smiling. I could be having the worst day but coming here puts a smile on my fave! They are always quick and everything tastes amazing. I recently started a diet where I can't have that much sugar and they have a lot of sugar free options. Would highly recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Very clever!   Shark attack - which unfortunately didn't have the gummy shark in it but they gave my friend a punch card with 10 stamps, but that's only because they forgot about his drink in the first place. That's okay, he said it was still delicious without it.  Guava have it - you can taste the Dew and guava more than any other flavors.  Life's a peach - I can taste the flavors all around, if you like peach then it's a must have!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place and their ability to add a twist of a classic soda to something spectacular! Life's a peach with coconut cream, YUM! Only negative is thieir cookies are too wildly sweet and they aren't open on Sundays. Customer service is always excellent as well here."}
{"text":"I've tried 3 of their drinks and they were all amazing! The cookies were good once they got closer to room temperature. They gave them to us cold which made them less soft and chewy. Otherwise they were yummy and had great flavor. Can't wait to try the drive thru!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite soda place in the valley.  And yes, I have tried them all.  Sodalicious is across the street from my house, and it would make sense to go there rather than drive 15 minutes to Soda Shop, but I won't.  I can't stand the sickly syrupy sweet taste of SD sodas and their frozen, underbaked cookies.  The Soda Shop has amazing cookies (I suspect they come from the nearby Sweet Tooth Fairy-YUM!), and the sodas are perfect.  My vanilla cream Coke is perfectly flavored, and doesn't taste like a full cup of vanilla syrup was haphazardly dumped in it.  Their teenage staff is pleasant and happy, and they always get my order right.  Their punch cards are the bomb!  My teen kids all love it here, too.  It is a win-win for all of us when we are looking for a quick treat."}
{"text":"Stopped by so my son could get something sweet late in the afternoon.  Bypassed Ben & Jerry's thinking going local is best.     My son ordered the Rainbow soda - rainbow sherbet in orange soda.  The taste was good but - on the downside  - with the decor and all I expected a glass soda glass, not a styro cup like you would get at Speedway.  Also the young lady that took the order, although very nice she was not knowledgeable of the menu and asked us what the item included, which was odd.     Now that I have been there I would likely go to Ben and Jerry's next time, its a1/2 block away."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were going through Davidson and decided to stop off at The Soda Shop on Main Street for lunch.  First off the food is way overpriced for what you get.  The portions are small, and the food is mediocre.    My boyfriend and I both ordered a wrap and when his came out it had a long black hair wrapped up in it.  When we told our server she didn't apologize at all she just took it away.  We waited a long time for him to get another wrap.  Another girl, not our original server, just plopped it down on the table without a word of apology.  We never saw our server again and no one came to our table to check on us.  I got up several times and had to go to the counter to get our drinks refilled.  We were never even given a ticket to checkout with.    For what they are charging this is the worst experience I have had at a restaurant, which is really a shame because it could be something special.  It really feels like they don't care if you ever come back because they must have their regulars who keep them in business who don't mind paying for overpriced food without a smile.  I will never go back."}
{"text":"So I have been going to each and every soda restaurant in East Valley ,  I have been ordering the exact same drink. Last night I stopped by here.  When I told the girl what I wanted she didn't even know if they had the flavor orange or not. Turns out they have blood orange, which totally ruins the drink that I get. The blood orange flavor is too strong, it leaves an orange aftertaste.  The drink I get is Mountain Dew with peach and orange flavor and heavy whipping cream. The soda shop along with soda rush uses half-and-half and not heavy whipping cream. There is a another place in Mesa that uses heavy whipping cream and let me tell you it makes all the difference in the world.  True it may cost more but it makes the drink taste 10 times better.  I did not try any of the cookies.  So I give their version of my soda three out of five stars.  Who knows maybe other sodas are really good but I'm kind of hooked on this one."}
{"text":"Quick service! And the big booty Judy is amazing. Don't forget a sugar cookie too. #lfthx"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this is a wonderful location. Although parking may be a bit difficult (I recommend parking around back next to the fire station) it is a prime location with not many competing restaurants. There is also so much foot  traffic. The combination of these two things is quite honestly the only reason this place has stayed in business. The service is always awful. Never friendly, always trying to force you out the door. The food is pretty awful, not to mention ridiculously overpriced. Also, their ice cream and milkshakes aren't even good, not to mention super overpriced. Do yourself a favor and go to Brick House Tavern two minutes away that has way better food and lots of parking and then stop by Whits Frozen Custard to get yourself your ice cream. You'll thank yourself for not stepping foot in the horrible establishment that is The Soda Shop."}
{"text":"Wow! So much for potential. With such a great location this place should practically sell itself. The staff is unbelievably rude (this coming from a New Yorker!) and the food not worth it. Maybe they'll start reading these reviews and get new management."}
{"text":"I am not someone who drinks a lot of soda, but after trying The Soda Shop that night just change! I love their large menu with lots of unique flavors and mixtures that I would never think of! Very friendly staff, affordable drinks and yummy sugar cookies...what more could you ask for?!"}
{"text":"Fun place! I tried the back seat bingo (Pepsi-mango-coconut) and it was really yummy. Everything is on the sweet side so be prepared for a sugar rush. The iced oatmeal cookie was enormous and delicious. The vibe is great too. It's a great place to get together with a buddy and just hang out while sipping on a sweet drink."}
{"text":"This is a cool place to grab some custom handmade sodas. Really harkins back to the old soda fountains but with a modern aesthetic. Going to have to try the ice cream at some point."}
{"text":"Awesome soda creations. I had the Big Daddy and it was refreshing and not too sweet. Cookies are AHHHmazing! Iced Oatmeal made my day. A great pick me up alternative to the typical Dunkins run :)  Thank you for the change! I will definitely be back to try something different. #lfthx #thesodashop #thesodashopaz"}
{"text":"I've seen a few of my friends check-in at The Soda Shop so I made the drive to get a treat on Saturday night. It's hidden in the parking lot, so it took a few minutes for me to find it, however I'm glad I did. It didn't take long to get through the quickly growing line; I ended up getting the Big Booty Judy - coke with raspberry, vanilla, and lime - and the frosted sugar cookie.  Mostly, my drink tasted like coke with lime & not the actual flavors so that was a bit disappointing, but I imagine if they had put any more of the syrups in, it would've gotten too sweet. The highlight of my order was the sugar cookie though. It was really soft and delicious, everything I look for in a good cookie!  There's a drive thru if you're in a rush & don't want to get out of the car. I'd definitely recommend swinging by if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Bad service, below average food, way overpriced. Still one of my favorite places ever.   Also if you see a little brown girl named Maggie working when you come- tip her well!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I go often, the owners are so sweet and the staff is awesome, they are always so kind, I love the atmosphere they created! It's the soda version of Starbucks !(:  I love it!(:"}
{"text":"Their sugar cookies are to die for! I love bringing my almost to year old here for games and a treat! We meet up with some of my friends and play jenga or whatever other games they have out! Such a cute place to take pictures as well. I recommend the Waikiki with Dr Pepper!"}
{"text":"Long way from my normal stomping ground. Found myself there while visiting my cousins this past weekend. Davidson campus is so nice. Nice day out, taking pictures and enjoying the nice weather can stir up an appetite.  We made our way to the soda shop. It's nice, quaint little place. Very busy. The workers were hustling. The table got the chicken marinara hoagie (mine), buffalo chicken hoagie, and the chipotle hotdog, cherry coke, cherry coke float (mine), original soda (tasted).  Man, the marinara hoagie was delicious. It didn't look like a whole lot of food but they pack the sandwiches with meat. Not a light serving which is great. The float was also pretty good. They don't hold back on the coke syrup at all over there. Watery your soda will not be. In addition, each of the plates came with their original (?) chip fries. It's a nice twist in French fries and really good.  The service was alright. They were packed and busy, but they did their best and we didn't wait a whole lot. Overall a nice experience.   Seating is a bit limited for the amount of traffic they seem to get. So, keep that in mind.  All in all, definitely recommend swinging by if you are in the area. Prices are really fair. If it wasn't a 4h drive from where i live, that place would catch me often."}
{"text":"I've been looking forward to eating here for so long and left feeling underwhelmed and disappointed. I think the novelty of it is its quaint outside and inside, but the food and service is nothing to write home about. They have a large menu, which makes it difficult to tell what they specialize in. We came in for a weekday lunch and waited 40+ minutes for our food. Food is average. I did want to try a milkshake but may have to save that for if I ever come again."}
{"text":"Amazing and cute little shop! Had the big daddy and the peach drink and they were both SO GOOD!! The girls were so friendly and the place was nice and clean. Definitely coming back for some MO."}
{"text":"They have the best sugar cookies out of all the soda places! We were there first thing to get our caffeine fix on the way to work and they kept things moving at the drive through"}
{"text":"This place is delicious, my wife gets the coco-lime with coconut cream (Diet Coke with coconut cream and fresh limes) and I enjoy the dew or die (mountain due with mango pur√©e), but I change it up ever so often with a big booty judy and I swap the raspberry out for cranberry (making it Coke with vanilla, cranberry, and lime). Service is good and the employees are friendly. Sometimes after a day of school at ASU it is just nice to get a soda and sit on one of the couches they have with my wife and sip a soda. Also their cookies are some of the best I have ever had, I highly recommend the black and white cookie!"}
{"text":"so cute from the outside, a big disappointment.  I've lived in the area for over 10 years, meaning to stop in.  Did that tonight.  Bleh.  We sat down and the waitress came over within a few minutes - we had time to pick out what we wanted to eat and our menus were closed (the international signal for \"we're ready\" - or so I thought).  She took our drink order and promptly turned around and left.  ok.  I'll get over it - just weird.  Came back and I ordered a turkey club with fruit on the side (because a side salad is $3 extra!?!).  She left with our orders.  Then I noticed that they served beer - she never looked at our table until the food arrived and by then I had lost interest.  My food arrived with 'french fries' - when I reminded her, she said 'oh' grabbed my basket turned around, went into the back, disposed of the fries, brought my basket back and said she'll bring my fruit out in a bit..oookkkkkaaayyyy...   Mac & Cheese is Kraft.  My club sandwich had american cheese (really??).   And the kids drinks (advertised for $.99?  I suppose you have to specify that your 8 & 11 year old kids are kids - otherwise they'll get the $1.75 soda - all sizes come with free refills - IF the waitress stops by your table again).    I need to note here that we were there at 7p and it was only 1/2 full so the wait staff was not stressed in any way.  There isn't a thing here that I would ever want to return for. Nothing bad, but nothing at all worth returning for!"}
{"text":"My favorite little quick stop in Lake Norman. Simple but yummy food, good service (albeit young/inexperienced wait staff. They are always very busy but it's so darling!"}
{"text":"Went to the grand opening and were so impressed! We loved all the drinks we tried, the Big Daddy being our top fave, followed by Dew or Die and Fruit Ninja. The staff is INCREDIBLE. and the atmosphere is just so hip! Can't wait to go back and try more amazing drinks!"}
{"text":"I'll take you to The Soda Shop; one taste of what they got, so much to choose from you won't stop! Oh!!! Life's a Peach, Big Daddy, The 480, Coke O' Lime or whatever you're into!    Gilbert has a sweet spot and it's definitely The Soda Shop!  An amazing mix of sodas, super sweet cookies, custard with mix ins and that's not all, they serve it up with fast and friendly customer service with affordable prices.  Whether we've ordered in or taken it to go via the drive thru, busy or not (which it's always busy) service has been great! There is plenty of room, a comfy couch, tables, counter top seating  and even a large screen TV. I like The 480 a mix of Diet Coke, cranberry and fresh lime and the Coke O' Lime a mix of Diet Coke, Coconut with fresh lime. I can't decide which one is my favorite, they're both delicious! The kids seem to favor The Shark Attack a mix of Sprite, lemonade, blue raspberry and a gummy shark which they love finding at the bottom of their drink! If you like it fruity the Berry Good, Fruit Ninja and Laguna Peach are packed with flavor, and the Happy Camper is perfect for the root beer  lover! We've tried the custard, once with Oreo and then with Reese's both a creamy dreamy delight down to the last bites. The sugar cookie smothered in frosting is perfectly soft and could satisfy any sweet tooth.  I'm still waiting to try the oatmeal cookie that everyone's been raving about, but they've always been sold out. I guess that's the way the cookie crumbles but we'll definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"I would really like to give this place a good review because of its kitschy nostalgic decor and makes you feel like what it was like going to a diner back int he '50s. However, the staff in this place make sure you don't linger over an order of just coke or shake and fries for too long. As soon as you sit, they ask you what'd you'd to drink. I was here to try their phosphates -- homemade soda basically, but they did not give me the menu prior to asking what I would like to drink.   And if you order just water, they give you an attitude. Also, they'd want you to order as quickly as possible. As soon as you're handed the menu, they are right back before even you are done perusing or deciding on what to order. And as soon as you finish your meal, even though you're still drinking your soda or having your shake, they'd quickly drop the check onto your table. You don't have to time to enjoy your meal and fantasize on what it was like dining in the '50s. I mean what this is what this place is trying to sell -- that fantasy and decor and not the food.   I understand if they were busy and there are people waiting, but the place was almost empty when I was there. Staff didn't really give sh*t if you were there or not. They were giving each other disapproving looks whenever patrons would take time to place their order or have their meal. Food is overpriced ans portioned small and standard fast food quality. Have to give them credit for their phosphates and shakes though. You're better off getting take-out but then again the whole point of going to this place is to experience '50s dining, which they fail miserably and because of the staff's draconian attitude."}
{"text":"While I can't really wrap my head around the idea of a shop dedicated specifically to soda, I have to say the place seems quite popular, and I have a huge sweet tooth, so I decided to check it out today. For anyone that is new to this sort of thing, their menu has a mixture of sodas and add-ons that make a unique tasting drink. They also offer things like Red Bull, and snacks like cookies. I got the Busta Limes, which was sweet, bubbly, and just perfect, as well as a sugar cookie, topped with buttercream (?) frosting. As a sugar fiend, I was definitely pleased, and if I ever have a bad day, I know where I am heading. Definitely don't make it a habit, cause this place screams diabetes"}
{"text":"This is such a great place that it's hard to believe so many people walk by it.  It is the only real soda shop I've ever been to snd it is dressed absolutely right for that role, They sell store made old fashioned sodas and phosphates which can morph into some old fashioned perfect deserts including real ice cream sodas.  They make delightful milkshakes and offer a nice variety of lunch items.  And they even serve alcohol do s breakfast Bloody Mary finished off an eggs Benedict. They serve breakfast to after noon and have lots of burger and hot dog renditions. The lemonade, lime aid and orange juices are all store squeezed and oh so delicious. The ambiance of the place is circa 1920 snd the quality of its treats make it a part of your future. It is undeniably kid friendly,"}
{"text":"Super tasty and great customer service. We thoroughly enjoyed our drinks, especially the orange soda one with a scoop of custard."}
{"text":"Pretty cool and fun place to hangout! Simple and straightforward, but an interesting concept. If ****buck's can offer flavored coffee, why not offered specialty/flavored sodas?"}
{"text":"Wow...customer service was really bad. Take out Turkey Reuben took 23 minutes at 2:15 with more staff than customers.  Brunette acted like she hated life and passed it along. Watched them take more than 10 minutes to make this couple's milkshakes. I could go on and on but not worth it.   Sandwich was good but experience ruined it. They never even apologized!"}
{"text":"Good is mediocre. I was hoping to love this place so that it could become a tradition to eat there Friday's as a family. The employees didn't check on us and we had to go inside to place our orders and ask for refills. The prices aren't terrible but a bit overpriced for what we received. We probably won't go back but it was worth a shot."}
{"text":"Such a yummy stop this was my first time and I really enjoyed the stop #lfthx #thesodashop #thesodashopaz"}
{"text":"This place has some super fun flavors. The sugar cookies are good, but I have had better at other shops. HOWEVER, I would still highly recommend this place. GREAT customer service."}
{"text":"They told us we had a \"free upgrade day\" but failed to mention we have to pay for add-ins. Wasn't really organized and didn't put gummy sharks in my drink when basically that was the add in I had to pay for."}
{"text":"Not a good use of your money. There are much better restaurants around for your money. As a student at the college I NEVER eat here and I would suggest the same for visitors to the college and the town.  Save yourself and go to toast or restaurant x"}
{"text":"The Soda Shop is awesome!! Amazing array of drinks and addicting sweet treats. My fav drink is the Big Booty Judy but the popular drink definitely seems to be the Shark Attack. Will be back every day I can make it! Also helps that the owners are laid back and have seemed to have trained the staff very well. 5 stars."}
{"text":"Such a fun place to hang out and sip sodas. The cookies are so yummy as well. I also LOVE that they have a drive thru for quick soda fixes!  I've picked up my daughter early from school a couple times and hung out inside. She loves it. Great bonding time."}
{"text":"I love The Soda Shop!  It's so adorable and a really fun place to hang out.  Their frosted oatmeal cookies are absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"Really cool atmosphere, super friendly staff, and very clean. Good tunes, delicious soda creations:  I tried Butterbeer and it was frosty and deeelish."}
{"text":"The Soda Shop has been in Davidson forever it seems. There milkshakes and fries are awesome! My signature order is a vanilla milkshake with Reece's cups and banana. It's not overly expensive and has menu items for everyone (vegan, vegetarian, etc.)"}
{"text":"This place has become a favorite on mine. Only bummer is that I live in Phoenix and they aren't close. But anytime I drive down to Mesa to visit my mom I for sure plan on swinging by to pick up a Shark Attack. The staff is always friendly and quick to get your drink ready for you. Plus it's just a cool place I am sure to just hang out and chill for a bit to escape the heat.   I have always had them come out and do a party for an event and that was a huge success and ton of fun to have them there. Pricing is fair and the staff that came were amazing. If you want something for a party, wedding and event is suggest checking them out. They are worth it!"}
{"text":"Kind staff and quick service! Grateful for that drive-thru! Need a bigger variety for menu selection with maybe some things for the milder soda explorer- (my husband would rather keep things simple than add soooo many things to his precious mtn dew). Overall cool place and tasty soda! Love that vanilla cream- need to figure out how to get that for my house! #lfthx"}
{"text":"Staff are quick, always friendly. The drinks are awesome. Love this place! Convenient drive-through and location."}
{"text":"I love concocting fun new drinks,  however,  it's  hard to find a place that does the same with non alcoholic  drinks. This place does it and they do it well. I made a trip specifically to try them with a friend and we were not disappointed.  I got the Big Booty Judy, which at first glance sounds like it would have clashing flavors, I promise it is delicious,  and a great deal.  In addition to that their oatmeal cookies  are amazing,  inexpensive  and huge.  I even was willing to share with my friend,  and I have a strict no cookie sharing policy."}
{"text":"If you have an insatiable sweet tooth, this is the place to go. The menu is on a chalkboard with trendy names for each soda.The prices are affordable, and the flavors are creative and tasty. Now, I'm not much of a soda or sweets kind of girl, but my daughter begged me to take her here. She loves it and the atmosphere on a Friday night is like a scene from Grease, with teens hanging out at the soda bar and couches. I wish I had a spot like that to hang out at back in my day!  If you don't mind a younger crowd and love sweets, you will love this place. The trouble is, I don't. But I am rating it 5 because my 12 yr old rants and raves over this cute little Soda Shop!"}
{"text":"The Soda Shop in Davidson is a piece of small-town, old-school college charm.   Opened in 1951, it has been serving up sandwiches, soup, salads and ice cream to the residents and students of Davidson College for nearly 60 years.  How old-school is this place? They only accept cash, which really only adds to its charm.  The Soda Shop offers dine-in or carry-out service, and is open Sat-Thurs 8am-8pm, and on Fridays from 8am-9pm.  Great place to spend an afternoon walking around on the picturesque Davidson College campus, then to just cross the small main street to the Soda Shop.  Also a good place to people watch, especially on warm afternoons.  The burgers and milkshakes are awesome!"}
{"text":"I really liked the decor, but the food left a lot to be desired.  Standard grill food. Nothing special. The biggest problem was the parking. I was meeting friends at 1:00 (after the lunch rush) and was 15 minutes late because I had to circle the block 4 times looking for parking. Don't expect to park nearby. Street parking is non existent. And there is no lot easily accessible by non-students."}
{"text":"This place is great. Nay, I say AWESOME! As long as my family been doing our mixed drinks at QT and Sonic, this place takes it up a notch. Mixed carbonated drinks and non-alcoholic libations abound in combinations that tantalize the taste buds. Yes, they are new. Yes, there is a wait. Bring some  patience and understanding, pioneering and trailblazing take time. It is well worth the time spent and I am looking forward to see what The Soda Shop comes up with next!"}
{"text":"My wife loves her some Soda Shop! The iced oatmeal cookie is great!  She goes more than we would like to admit as well as a lot of people that live around us in Gilbert! I love to support local successes. This place is worth spending your money at because of who is running it!"}
{"text":"This place is so good, this is my second review.  I felt the need to mention that the employees are seriously the kindest humans I've ever met. The Dr Pepper tastes better here than anywhere else.  Get a mug and get cheaper drinks.. totally worth it and they are SO cute. The cookies are HUGE and tasty. I'll forever be a Soda Shop enthusiast."}
{"text":"Portions have gotten smaller than in the past. Other options in Downtown Davidson. Should not skimp on fries. Wrap was very small and finished in under 10 bites."}
{"text":"Yummy drinks, good cookies, friendly staff, fun atmosphere. I will definitely be back. I cant wait for my daughter to try it after school."}
{"text":"Pretty much your old-school diner, but a tad bit more expensive. For what it is worth, the place is pretty good. There's surprisingly quite a few veggie options. Depends on what you're into, but overall, it's good. I wouldn't say the food will rock your socks, but it shouldn't disappoint either. Best for lunch and an early dinner.   Not much else to say about this place. Ideally, better if you have kids. Not really a date-worthy kind of place. Kind of small too.    Parking isn't great. Good luck with that."}
{"text":"This is a new place and I never thought I could love soda so much.  My favorite is the guava have it.  It's a blend of Mountain Dew and coconut and some other magical ingredients.  They also sell cookies which my favorite is the oatmeal with frosting. It makes my mouth water every time.  The best is for last they have this custard that is overly satisfying.  The best custard I've ever tasted.  It's really creamy and you can have Oreo with it or peanut butter cups and other flavors."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, delicious cookies, and so many soda options!! Iced oatmeal cookie was my favorite. My two year old daughter loved the cookies too! The atmosphere is laid back and very nicely decorated. I can't wait to go back to try the custard."}
{"text":"This is one of favorite places to visit ! It's so cute, always clean, the service is great & ALL of the items we have tasted are great! A few of our favorites are the Sugar cookies, the black and white cookies, the shark attack drink, the fruit ninja, the Red Bull reviver & the custards! All so yummy, will you always go back for more!"}
{"text":"Such a fun novelty shop. I don't live in Mesa but anytime I'm in the area I stop in for a mixed drink. Even bought a tumbler for my special Mesa days! Can't wait to try a new drink every time. Pricing is more than a fountain drink at a gas station but definitely worth the price difference."}
{"text":"Are you a HARRY POTTER fan?! I'm sure you are ('cause who in their right mind isn't?!)! You can try it locally at Soda Shop without having to head to Orlando (or England)! Save yourself several hundred bucks and splurge on a cookie while you're there!  BONUS: they have a drive-thru!  Only reason it isn't 5 Stars is I am an ingredient snob and they had no idea what the ingredients were in the cookies (but reassured me they were not from a mix) and use Coffeemate creamer. IMO it would be even more of a treat destination with a better selection of quality soda and creamers."}
{"text":"I love the soda shop! It's exactly what Gilbert needed.  So unique.  I love the Life's a Peach and their sugar cookies! My only complaint is they seem to put a lot of ice in the cup....next time I need to tell them easy ice. Don't get me wrong though, I am definitely a regular there."}
{"text":"Best place for custard and soda! Love the atmosphere and great customer service. :) This place is a must go!"}
{"text":"It's... here! My wife loves the place but for me I just can't seem to make it work for me. I'm giving it 4 stars bc they have great customer service and good ice cream. The environment is very much high school orange county show feel (anyone that gets that reference will get what I'm saying. If not then read on). Apart from feeling like the oldest one in the room unintentionally chaperoning for teenagers it's not a bad place if you like that. Nonetheless, I'll be back cuz my wife loves it."}
{"text":"So different from any other place nearby and the shopping center where it's located will be revived because of this place. Awesome cookies, custard, and obvi the soda! Friendly people, fun atmosphere, great place to be!"}
{"text":"We went here one weekend to try it out.  It is a very cute place with Davidson items posted all over the walls.  I had the Biloxi sandwich with sweet potato fries, it was very yummy.  We also split a mint chocolate chip milkshake that was really good.  Next time I go I will have to try one of their Phosphate soda's, they look interesting."}
{"text":"I love this place! I usually get the Fruit Ninja but if I'm not in a soda mood then I get the Main Squeeze. I work right by here so it's really easy for me to stop by on my break or on my way home (if they're still open). I'm still giving it 5/5 but I do wish that there was a menu outside for the drive thru and a sign (or a more visible sign if there is one) that has their hours on it. I will definitely be back though!"}
{"text":"Hidden Gem For Tasty Treats - Worth The Visit For Sure!  I got the 24 ounce Main Squeeze Lemonade Drink and it was a tasty drink I would order again for sure.   The Double chocolate frosted cookie was actually rather extraordinary! I was surprised by the actual greatness of flavor and freshness!  The staff all seemed friendly, especially the girl who took our order. She seemed happy and nice.  They have some leather couches for hanging out and relaxing on, also some tables to sit at.   The interior is clean and nicely arranged with ample remaining space. I like the wood accent wall!  There were families playing board and card games around hanging out and teenagers discussing the monolithic importance of absolutely nothing of importance...   Parking IS NOT EASY... this place is tucked behind the frontage auto repair shop and around the corner of the mall so you won't see it from the road at all.   This is a nice spot..."}
{"text":"Such a fun and delicious treat! Their combos are fun and actually taste good! My husband likes the Big Booty Judy and the Butterbeer (a must for Harry Potter fans such as ourselves) and I'm a fan of The 480. Note: this is the only soda mixology shop that I've found to carry caffeine free diet soda.   The staff is super nice and knowledgeable. The lines can be long at peak times. The staff always hustle but never make you feel rushed.   The make a mean sugar cookie too! What's not to love?!"}
{"text":"There are a lot of negative reviews for this place. I'm not sure what people are expecting, but I was actually quite pleased with my experience. I never expected something upscale or fancy. I like the atmosphere. While it was super crowded, that isn't a bad thing actually. I ordered an Egg Club and potato salad. It's possible that the place is a smidgen over priced, but the food was pretty good so I don't feel like I wasted money. They have quite a large menu with really just about anything you could want. I was surprised how many things there are to choose from, breakfast items like omelettes and biscuits and gravy, a good selection of hamburgers choices, sandwiches galore, daily specials, salads, and plenty of other thing things. Don't forget the sweets section with all kinds of milkshakes, floats, sundaes, and other \"specialities\" If your in Davidson and want a fun experience, and a trip back into time I would stop in."}
{"text":"Ugh this place is so good! My husband and I have been coming here for years! Everything is so good and even on a keto diet we can find things to drink."}
{"text":"Every time we go here we experience great customer service and the prices are very reasonable. They have very small sizes for my 3 year old and huge ones for me and my husband. We went out of our way today to go to the soda shop because I wanted to treat my daughter."}
{"text":"The drink and cookie I got from here were just to die for!  I highly recommend this place... and specifically a double fudge cookie!  The atmosphere is just lovely as well... rustic wood walls, cute turquoise accents... so nice!  And I love that they have so many options to choose from... truly endless possibilities for customizing your soda!"}
{"text":"Overall pretty happy with this place! Clean, simple, not fussy. I'm glad they have coconut cream which is an easy substitute for half and half in some of the drinks if you're vegan or lactose intolerant.   I got the big daddy, which is Dr Pepper with raspberry and coconut cream. Basically it's like crack in a cup. So so so delicious and SO sweet. If you're not a sweet drink fan, you might not love it here as much as me... but if you are, in fact, a sweet drink person, you'll adore it here.   They have pretty awesome drink combos on the menu, and you can choose from all their syrups, fruit purees and more to make a diy one if you want.   There are so many that look awesome - I'm glad there's one in north Mesa by my house! I will definitely be back.   I docked one star because they finished making my drink but didn't call it out, and it was just sitting on the counter. It was probably 10 minutes after I ordered when I realized it was my drink behind the counter sitting there. Haha. I asked and they handed it over. Not a big deal, and won't keep me from coming back. :) There are plenty of drinks I want to try."}
{"text":"Mint chocolate chip milkshake. There's nothing more to say but since there's a minimum number of characters required for a review, I'll say it again...mint chocolate chip milkshake. Just get one and you'll see."}
{"text":"My first soda shop experience was great! Friendly staff. There was a line in the drive thru, but it moved very quickly and I was pleased with that. Their sugar cookies are my favorite ever!"}
{"text":"Great retro vibe.  It could be 1953 or 1965.  A favorite stoop in Davidson.  Really a tourist stop but all the locals are here too.    Very good burgers.   Grilled cheese quite good.  Shakes and malts yummy.  Cherry coke float is a favorite.  Onion rings good.    The walls say it all.  See original SAE charter for davidson college chapter.  Lots of sports photos and old programs.  Almost a museum. Great booths.  Mid afternoon good time for guaranteed no wait.    They could have filmed Hoosiers here.   Ollie could be in the next booth."}
{"text":"Who would have thought you could have a store in soda alone?  This is a creative soda shop where they serve Coke products with a twist,  and they are so so yummy!  This hidden location at the very west part of the Fat Cats strip mall could be easily missed, however I knew it was there somewhere in the dark parking lot.   My kids were dying to try as their friends have all posted about it. We were greeted by a friendly young man at the counter who was eager to help us in our selection.  He was genuinely happy to be working there. ..I love that!   Each soda is differently priced even if they are the same size, I think it depends on how many ingredients it includes. The 3 of us all ordered something different and 2 chocolate chip cookies costing $10. That's reasonable!   They have a drive thru which constantly had at least 4 cars in it and the line sometimes was out the door.  There is a bar to sit up at and watch them make drinks and socialize with staff.  The young kids loved that as each seat was taken.  There are 2 sofas and many tables and thru provide outlets for your electronics......yeah!!"}
{"text":"Tons of throwback charm and loads of potential, but from a food perspective, they aren't making much of an effort.  There's nothing wrong with the selection of sandwiches, but it's the kind of super simple two slices of white bread and chips deal that I could throw together at home in about two minutes.  That would be fine for $4-$5 a plate, but the prices are upwards of $7-$9.  All the potential is there for this to be a perfect little soda shop, it would just take someone to take over the kitchen and come up with a new vision."}
{"text":"We love this place.  The drive through is super convenient.  The staff is friendly.  Their drink concoctions are out of this world!  And the cookies are delicious.  They sell Sweet Tooth Fairy cookies which in my opinion is ALWAYS a good idea.  I love their black and white cookie and my husband adores the oatmeal cookie. If I bring him one back he never complains about how much I've spent on pop.   The inside is very tastefully decorated.  They have awesome benches.  And I'm not just saying that because my BIL made them.  It can be kind of loud, especially when it's busy.  Which it always seems to be.  But it's kid friendly and casual and a fun place to go.  If you are a pop lover you need to try this place asap.  I love the Big Booty Judy and the Coke O Lime.  My kids love Happy Camper and The Shark Attack, (of course) although a few times we've had an attack sans shark when we ordered through the drive through and my kids were pretty bummed.  I wish they still have out menus at the drive through to keep in my car.  Sadly they just have a laminated one.  This place is awesome!"}
{"text":"Fun. Clean. Great ice. :) love the Happy Camper! Can't wait to try the mint Oreo custard."}
{"text":"Fast and good. I love the sodas and cookies but this time I tried a hot cocoa and it was REALLY good!"}
{"text":"I loved this place. The drinks are so creative and tasty, and the service was great! This is a place we will frequent when in the mood for a tasty unique drink."}
{"text":"We LOVE the Soda Shop!! Perfect trip with the kiddo on early release days or half days.  My favorite is the Life's A Peach Soda and DO NOT forget to order a sugar Cookie.. they are delish!   The service is always super friendly and helpful if you can't make up your mind.  I highly recommend the Soda Shop to all my friends and family."}
{"text":"This place is always packed! While I don't like lines, that is a clear sign that they are doing something right.   The customer service is fantastic. I went through the drive through this time and was met by a very friendly and knowledgable employee.   I tried the \"happy camper\", the iced oatmeal cookie, and the black and white cookie. The drink was a great root beer. The cookies were both great if I had to choose once over the other, I would go for the iced oatmeal.   Neat idea and really clean and modern place.  Great little find."}
{"text":"Super cute idea and a great hang out for teens.  There were plenty of teens there when we were there.  I'm glad they have a place they can lounge to relax with friends in a safe environment."}
{"text":"I want to like the Soda Shop, I just can't.  Food - just not good or fresh.  Most recently we went and had breakfast.  We were served cold, instant grits with cheese on top - yuck.  Eggs and bacon were ok, but it's hard to mess those up.  Staff is not particularly friendly and give the impression that they would rather be hanging out doing anything other than serving you.  Ambiance is similar to a 50s era diner, but totally manufactured and not authentic.  I'm of the opinion that the 50s are totally over done and the Soda Shop's attempt to recreate that era falls short and it just isn't quaint or charming.  I hope they get it together as it has a lot of potential, but they are certainly not realizing that potential."}
{"text":"We were in Davidson all summer long and never felt the need to wander into The Soda Shop. All I'd ever heard about it was that, for the type of food served, it was overpriced and overrated. So why, WHY did we get sucked into this dingy little time warp on our last day in town?!?!   Well, the real reason is that Toast had a line out the door as per usual on the weekends, and Restaurant X was closed for some inexplicable reason.   So, reluctantly, we wound up in The Soda Shop. Opened in 1951, indeed, and it appeared that most of the interior was circa the same year and hadn't been updated, reupholstered, resurfaced or possibly even deep cleaned since then. It was just kind of... sad. The service was a little odd, as our waitress appeared to take our drink order never to be seen again and then the guy behind the counter had us sort of shout our order over to him.   When the food arrived it was merely average. The saving grace of the entire experience was my order of sweet potato fries. Shaped more like chips they were crispy on the outside, soft in the middle, and I demolished them, leaving everything else almost untouched. I'll give them this: they specialize in malts and shakes, and this may be the area in which they excel. Clearly food is not.   I realize this has been an institution in Davidson for 50 years, but as it grows, the town has a number of newer eateries of much higher quality and not necessarily higher in price range."}
{"text":"Guava Have It- Mnt Dew & Guava for the win! Looks like a brand new shop, it's a perfect location for me and I like new flavor sodas. Pretty excited to try them all."}
{"text":"Food: 4/5. Food was okay. Buffalo Chicken Hoagie was delicious, according to the patron who got. In his words \"it was super cheesy, and the bread was super soft.\" Just what you're looking for in diner food. My Philly cheese steak was underwhelming. The onions were almost raw.   Atmosphere: 4/5. Quaint. What you'd expect for a soda shop.   Service: 3/5. Average. Nothing special. Food took a while. Styrofoam cups."}
{"text":"I never drink soda, but when I do I go to the Soda Shop! Not a fan of the tea but everything else i've tried is delicious! Happy Camper (root beet and marshmallow i believe) is my favorite :D"}
{"text":"Really fun place. My wife got the rootbeer with toasted marshmallow and vanilla. Holy cow, it was delicious. It's a hip place, lots of people there that were on dates, but it also felt fine with our kids there. If I lived in the area, if definitely be coming back to try the rest of their sodas!"}
{"text":"First timer over here!!! Love the concept, decor, cookies, and of course the yummy soda. Staff was super friendly and helpful. I got the smooth criminal (suggested to me by the employee) and it hit the spot!"}
{"text":"I love the soda shop! Great vibe and fun place for the teenagers to hang out. I love the nerdy Dr Pepper. Super yummy and refreshing for the summer! #lfthx"}
{"text":"I was a Sodalicious regular and it's actually closer to me, but JORDAN is so friendly and fun, it's worth the extra drive:-)  He is great at advising you on new drinks and the service is fast."}
{"text":"Had the main squeeze and oatmeal frosted cookie and both were great. Drive thru was fast and the cashier was friendly. Can't wait to try more drink flavors."}
{"text":"I love this place! Its just like Fiiz in Utah, I'm so glad they brought something like it to Arizona! My favorite is a Coke with raspberry puree and blackberry"}
{"text":"Cute little traditional Soda Shop right on Main Street in Davidson. The best part for me was the fact that they split a milkshake for my sister and I. We had a Black and White (vanilla milkshake with Hershey syrup blended in) and it was EXACTLY what we wanted. Sweet and simple. For lunch I had a hot dog and it was perfect. Crunchy, grilled, and satisfied a craving. My sister had a tuna melt and was equally impressed.  This is a quick in and out pit-stop kind of place. It doesn't boast a crazy menu, because it is what it is, The Soda Shop."}
{"text":"Love it!  This place is a '50s style diner with undeniable authenticity, decorated with dozens of pieces of Davidson memorabilia.  It's been an institution for years, and it definitely has that old time charm, with wooden booths and a snack bar.  The number one reason go come here is their hamburger, which is about as great a burger you're going to get.  Their milkshakes are also great.  You can also order beer with your lunch, which is an unexpected but welcome surprise.  You can also buy candy at the cashier, if that strikes you as a good dessert.  My only complaint is that they don't take credit or debit cards, which is a bit inconvenient, and that they close at 8 in the evening (although really this is a lunch place, so it's not that big a deal)."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some beverages with the family and was pleasantly surprised.. The place was busy and service was fast and efficient, plenty of places to sit and relax, kind of a cross between an old school soda shop and a Starbucks. They have a ton of options to choose from. **Sign up on their website and save 20%!!**  With the discount got out just over $8 for 4 people. - 4 sodas.. Will definitely be back to try some other flavors."}
{"text":"amazing customer service the girl that helped was so sweet and helpful!! Their drinks are great, a little pricey it'd be about the same price as dutch drink but totally worth it! I got one of their sugar cookies as well which are pretty big super filling and taste amazing as well!! Also very clean and so so cute inside! definitely will come back here if i'm around the area."}
{"text":"Been coming here since I was 2 years old. It will always have a special place in my heart   Went for lunch today with a friend, we were dining in. Food was fine, as usual. I ordered a water to drink, and was surprised when the server brought it out in a thick white styrofoam cup, not one of those red translucent Coke cups they used to have. I looked around and was shocked to find that all of their drinks are served in styrofoam.  To management: c'mon guys. I know styrofoam is easy and cheap and saves you the hassle of washing dishes, but styrofoam? Please wise up to the dangers of polystyrene - to your customers' health and to the environment. You don't have to be a treehugger like me, just don't be willfully malevolent to your longtime patrons and the Earth."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing considering the competition in the area for mixed sodas and treats. No menu boards outside yet they have a drive thru. Paid $2 for a dr. Pepper with vanilla, can't taste the vanilla at all and it is way smaller then I thought a medium would be. Next time I will just wait for happy hour at sonic!"}
{"text":"It doesn't pretend to be anything other than an old time soda shop... Great food, amazing menu."}
{"text":"Overpriced, overrated, cash only, small tables, rude people. What else can I say?  I wish I could post a better review, but, for a small town restaurant which has a big competition right next door, looks like they just do not want to change the way they do business to attract more customers.  The food is mediocre at best, served in disposable containers, fork and knifes. They will only accept cash, the portions for the price paid are very small and the service is really slow.  The tables can barely fit an average size person, so that means if you are overweight, skip this place.  The only thing I really like at this place is the ice cream and the shakes. If you are in just for that and have real CASH in hands, go for it! If you are here for brunch or other meal, go to Toast next door. It is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Sooooo glad we have this here in Arizona! I'm addicted to the Coke O Lime and black cookies!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this place has so much unrealized potential. We have given it several tries in the four years we've lived within walking distance but just cannot do it. The last time we gave in and walked in we u-turned right back out the door because it stunk like Lysol -- despite things just being grimy with an underlying stale stinky.   Also disappointing is the fact that everything and I do mean everything is served on paper or styrofoam and no real silverware. I mean, come on, what is this? 1982? It's a EAT-IN and it's 2010.  This place could be so cool, with some major changes.  I actually would probably get a milkshake to-go here from time to time. Their banana milkshake is awesome, with real bananas.  Hope they step it up."}
{"text":"Love the Spring Fling!! It is the most delicious drink. They have the friendliest people there and they are always moving quickly! The cookies are the perfect share size or extra for yourself!"}
{"text":"Great stop for Sunday lunch.   Had the chicken salad melt on Texas toast and sweet potato fries.  Delicious!   Topped it off with Southern Comfort (dessert, not the liquor).  Yummy.  Cute diner."}
{"text":"I've visited the soda shop a couple times. The atmosphere is trendy and the menu is great with a good variety of different mixed soda drinks!  I was nervous to try the Happy Camper but was so happy I did! Also, try an iced oatmeal cookie! They are delicious and worth the trip alone!  I didn't give it 5 stars because the wait is very long every time I go. Sorry"}
{"text":"I love a good dive. Some of my favorite eats are from questionable establishments in questionable areas, however, when there is a HOLE in the bathroom floor, I have serious reservations. What is this, Calcutta? Are there now monkies and yaks roaming the streets of Davidson??? Perhaps, since our first/last visit, they've fixed this (perhaps the health dept finally ventured in and handed them a red card???) but the food and service were not near good enough to make up for the sad, run down, hole in the floor aappearance. Burger, sandwich, hot dog, fries were okay but not good enough to venture back in for another try.   PS. My favorite chinese place in L.A. has hanging fowl that you pass on the outskirts of the open kitchen as you seek the bathroom amongst the pallets of produce, so you know I'm not merely a faint of heart snob. Lol! :)"}
{"text":"Went here with my cousin's wife and her kids. The kids really like this spot. The atmosphere is definitely retro. The booths are small and can feel cramped for modern-day body sizes. Also, the place reeked of moth balls. The smell was pretty distracting, but thankfully once the food arrived I didn't the notice the odor anymore.  I had the Superhero burger with fries and a cherry phosphate. Nothing special, but it hit the spot and filled me up."}
{"text":"I wouldn't have know it was there except my wife and kids had seen and heard of it online. In an endcap in an awkward spot. That being said is appeared busy even though it was late. We were the last in line before they closed (drive through). We thought they might not serve us..lol..since they closed while we were waiting. They didn't and once we got our sodas and cookies it was GREAT! I'm really starting to like the little sodas shops...maybe it's because my brains really starting to kick out some dopamine from all the sugar. Great little spot."}
{"text":"I was at the fabulous Soda Shop yesterday. My sister got the Wakiki (coke with pineapple and coconut cream) I didn't know soda can taste like a pina colada.  It was like a mocktail. I got the Southern Belle (green tea with peach and citrus) I am watching my intake and having a metabolic drink that transported me back to the South. It was such a cool spacious modern yet retro place. The couple sitting at the counter made me nostalgic. #lfthx #organicad #TheSodaShop #TheSodaShopAZ"}
{"text":"Man I love this place!!! Bomb custard sodas and cookies. I've been here 2 times and tried several things and loved it all!!!   The shopping center where it's located has so many fun places as well!!!  My favorite cookie is the oatmeal with frosting.   Super fun date night with my wife and we also got to being the kids!!! Very kid friendly place."}
{"text":"The concept is a little odd but I'm not disappointed. Their sugar cookies are to die for!!! It's family owned which I love because your supporting local businesses. Try the herbal blackberry iced tea!"}
{"text":"I loved there mixed sodas. They have soft crunchy  ice and foam cups! In a hurry? Don't worry there is a drive thru!! Make sure to get a Oreo mint custard and an oatmeal cookie too if your trying if for the first time! Super friendly employees. I'll be going back often."}
{"text":"I've heard about this place from social media and friends and happened to be in the area ... so glad I stopped! The cookie was excellent and they have an awesome selection of custom sodas! Definitely a trendy instagramy atmosphere... love it! And the rose gold valentine cup ..."}
{"text":"If you want a delicious soda, stop by the soda shop! We came after bowling for a fun snack and drink and we had so much fun! They have games to play and just hang out while enjoying a soda and cookie. My husband got the smooth criminal and it was my favorite!"}
{"text":"Best milkshake of my life:) get the cookie dough!!! stopped by here while visiting Davidson.  Cute 50's style diner and must be popular.  The place was packed!!"}
{"text":"Such a cute little place!! My 4 year old said it was the \"most delicious cookie\" she ever had. We got the sugar cookies and they were amazing. The girls working in there were sweet as could be, and the kids loved hanging out and enjoying their treat!"}
{"text":"Cool place, they have many different soda combinations.  You can also get Italian sodas, cookies, and ice cream.  It's located in a big open building with couches and comfortable seating.  We we will coming back to this place again."}
{"text":"Flip to the back of the menu and you'll find about every drink known to man and then some! \"Then some\" meaning stuff like Phosphates or the Pink Elephant or whatever it was.  Stopped by here with a couple friends to close out the night with a quick drink and philosophical talk of the ages. Love the mood - that old diner feel. Considering this place has been around for like over 50 years, it's pretty easy to imagine guys with their slicked back hair twirling poodle-skirt clad ladies around in the twist to the humdrum of a jukebox. All the while a cute couple probably sucked down a phosphate with double straws smiling into each other's eyes...oop brain-freeze!  Didn't have the time or appetite to partake in the food but I'll bet it's not bad. On the counter they had a lemon drizzle bundt cake \"imported\" from the Blue Ridges to the west. Made at high altitude with ingredients somehow native to the mountains I'm betting it's a rare find and a splendid indulgence. I'm sure to come back on another run-through in Davidson. I mean I can't avoid it since I live so close and it's so very tempting."}
{"text":"Very cool place. Something I haven't seen others mention is the huge projection screen playing awesome videos and the environment. Lots of seating and a good place to hang out for a while. Drinks are very good and they have some interesting twists on your favorite sodas. I have tried a few drinks and all of their cookies. Very good."}
{"text":"Not impressed.   We decided to pop by here and our way to an appointment. This is not our normal soda place and I don't think I plan to ever go again. We got 3 drinks and 2 cookies (double fudge (with white frosting????) and a sugar cookie). One person in our party was happy with the drink. No one was impressed with the cookies.   Cons: 1) We waited nearly 30 minutes in the drive-thru line. Once you get in line... You're stuck. We ended up 15 minutes late for our appointment.   2) They have a partial menu on the backside of the building. If you want a full menu you have to go online.   3) They did not have, what I considered a very basic, flavor add-in (I requested caramel.) They are skimpy on the add-ins so ask for a double shot (and pay double) if you want the flavor to come through. On a side not, the peach puree was more like a peach pulp... Very chunky!  4) Cookies were cold, crumbly, huge, and flat. I think cold cookies is a \"thing\", but we did not care for it.   5) \"Drive-thru\" is a VERY relative term. There is no order microphone. They take your order at the window and than you (and everyone behind you) waits while they make it.   Pros: 1) They were on the way to my destination.   2) I got my caffeine fix.   To be fair, I am an East Valley SodaRusher and have come to appreciate certain things about my favorite soda shop. Once you have a Sugar Smash, no other cookie will do! Lol! That's why the Sugar Smash was voted best cookie in the valley 2 years in a row!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The ambiance is perfect for a friendly casual meetup. Not a big soda drinker myself but nice to have options outside of coffee and tea. Gets a little busy at times but comfy couches to sit in and always plenty of room."}
{"text":"I am used to Sodalicious. I thought this place was good, but my drink didn't have near the flavoring that sodalicious does. I will probably try it again because I love the coconut cream option."}
{"text":"We went in for breakfast and they gave our food to the wrong people. Then they brought it back over to us after it had already been cut into and pepper added by the people at the other table. Served on cheap syrofoam plates with a plastic fork for the same price as Toast just down the street. Well besides all that the food wasn't that good and the wait really bad. We would not recommend this place and won't be going back."}
{"text":"I live in Davidson and have lived in Davidson like towns that all have a place like th Soda Shop.  The food is ok, quaint atmosphere and tired interior.   It is overpriced for the fact they do not take credit cards. I am not sure of the value.  The only real compelling reason to eat here is it is a quaint soda shop.    I guess the reason I am so critical on the Soda Shop is that they really do not try and do not seem to give the appearance of caring to change. A bit arrogant in my opinion in this day."}
{"text":"One of the nicest spots to chill with friends and have good soda drinks or tea. The music is not as loud and the customer service is fantastic. Highly recommend it if you want a chill place  btw if you want to choose between the black, green or Herbal I would recommend the green, it is less sweet."}
{"text":"Dew or Die and Coke O Lime have been my favorite drinks. The oatmeal cookie is really good tho, I'm not a huge fan of tons of frosting so I scrape most of it off. And I was really bummed that the custard was over priced for the amount you get. I'll be back for the oatmeal cookie and dew or die weekly tho for sure! Great open atmosphere inside to hang out and a drive thru when I don't want to take my kids inside"}
{"text":"I'm not even a huge fan of soda but there is something about the clever combination of creative soda mixes and deliciously frosted cookies that melts my heart and brings me back to The Soda Shop again and again.  My recommendation is the Happy Camper with an Oatmeal cookie ~ sugar + sugar is always a promising duo. Other flavors I've tried & enjoyed include: Shark Attack (love the gummy shark that comes with) and Big Daddy."}
{"text":"We stopped by after attending the JUGGLING CONVENTION with a professional juggler friend at Davidson.... random!  I had an ice cream cone.  It was great, and made me wish there were more places like this in Charlotte.  I loved the atmosphere.  I will definitely be back, maybe at the next jugglers convention?  Just kidding!  I won't ever go to another one of those, but that is another review :)"}
{"text":"This a place to go for the ambiance of an old fashioned soda shop, not fast service.  Food is always great, just not lickety split on your table.  Sweet potato fries/chips are my favorite!"}
{"text":"Cutest place ever :) I love the nerdy Dr Pepper, I've tried all the other soda places around town and The Soda Shop's is definitely the best! Not to mention the staff makes you feel like your their best friend. It has a great feel good environment with delicious soda and treats :)"}
{"text":"The Soda Shop is a Davidson institution. it's been here for a very long time, and it is a really neat place to enjoy some old fashioned food and ice cream. Nothing fancy, but the menu is fairly extensive and there are quite a few gems to be found. They also have spectacular freshly squeezed homemade lemonade which is very refreshing on a hot summer day.  I got a nice little surprise in the mail the other day. The Soda Shop wished me a happy birthday and offered me a free ice cream cone. I joined their birthday  club a few years ago. So that was nice.  Today I stopped by for a patty melt and a cup of vegetable soup. The patty melt was spot on, and the vegetable soup absolutely delicious. it was made with a tomato base and had a deep, rich flavor. You get a few tasty corn nuggets on the side with soup.  You can also stop in for breakfast at 10 am on Weekdays and at 8 Am on weekends. I recently tried the Blarney Eggs- corned beef hash with sauteed onions, folded into scrambled eggs. Might sound a bit weird, but it was superb.  My favorite ice cream treat is the ice cream soda, but there are many to choose from.  Stop by and enjoy."}
{"text":"Great food! The homemade lemonade is great. The fries are great. I have gone to this restraint twice and am yet to be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I don't live far from The Soda Shop and have only been a handful of times prior to this last experience a couple of weeks ago, which will definitely be my last. My 2 y.o, who has multiple allergies, wanted french fries. Due to her allergies, we don't tend to take her out to eat often, and when we do, we state very clearly her allergies and just want honest answers on if they can accommodate. My husband told them of her gluten and dairy allergy and was told that they have neither ingredient in their fries. We proceeded to order and when we got home we noticed there was some kind of seasoning on the fries. When we called to ask about it, the same lady who told my husband it was allergen free, told us thay it does have seasoned flour, and began to place blame on other staff and said she would \"talk to them about knowing the ingredients on the menu.\" I don't think a little honesty is too much to ask. If you don't know the ingredient in the food you're serving, (which you should if you work there), just say you don't know. That way I can make an informed decision to not risk my child going to the hospital due to someone being so inconsiderate!"}
{"text":"Okay food, but service is horrible! Not friendly and very slow. Almost every time we try it. So disappointing. It could be great with better employees!!! I just don't get it. Maybe they need new management."}
{"text":"This place is so sickingly sweet that I can smell the sacrificial virgins from 6.66 miles away. Love the Happy Camper. I am definitely in kitty cat heaven. Meow. :3"}
{"text":"The Soda Shop - What can you say... it is a Davidson institution.  As the first reviewer mentioned, one thing you absolutely want to keep in mind is that the restaurant is cash only.  And, you should bring plenty of cash because the restaurant is deceptively expensive.  Lunch at the Soda Shop is going to cost you more than the same meal would cost in many large cities.  You are paying for the atmosphere.    The food is generally quite good.  There is nothing fancy here - burgers, sandwiches (including things like egg salad), and wraps.  They also have shakes and ice cream desserts.  (They serve breakfast, though the restaurant doesn't open very early.)  The price of most of the sandwiches is in the range from four to six dollars.  That includes a bag of chips or a small cup of the side of the day (typically something like potato salad) plus a pickle spear.  For an extra dollar you can order cottage fries or sweet potato fries, and they are both very good.    When I go to the Soda Shop I typically get a sandwich, cottage fries, and a soda.  With tax and tip I spend $10.  It is a place that I go infrequently - not because I don't like it, but because I think that's too much for what you are getting.  Nonetheless, the place is busy almost all the time and you are probably going to have to wait if you show up during the prime lunch hour.  The first reviewer's tip about sitting at the counter is really a good one."}
{"text":"The Soda Shop offers Gilbert residents (especially busy moms) a great stop in or drive thru place for the times you want to celebrate or just cope with another mom day. The local drink \"480\" is a refreshing delight. It combines freshly squeezed lime juice, cranberry juice and diet coke. Divine. With an addition of a cookie, it provides this mom with enough fuel (sugar and caffeine) to make it through another day."}
{"text":"I feel like this review isn't even needed but for the non believers, only soda I'll drink! The Big Daddy is my fav. We fill up a lunch card in a week and get our free 44oz drink!"}
{"text":"Ugh... I was so excited to take my daughter to an old time soda shop, and when she was off from school one day we did just that... But it went from good to gross over the hour and a half it took us to get out of there. The service was slow and the food was not eatable, I sent everything back except the mini-corndogs because my daughter said \"Meh - I'm so hungry I'll eat them...\" The place couldn't even get the ice cream shake correct - gezz people your name is The Soda Shop for goodness sakes!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars, I would.  Service was absolutely the worst ever and every other table in the place was talking about the horrible service today too.  A table next to ours dropped their menus, talked loudly, etc trying to get the attention of a server and the just couldn't.  Our lunch was almost 2 hours long and with an 8 month old trying to keep happy - was less than fun.  Took FOREVER to get a server to come to us, once she did she was less than thrilled to be there, and it showed.  Ordered a few of their specials drinks (shake and phosphate) and she brought the wrong drink.  Once we got the right one, we wished we had just chose water.  The strawberr phosphate was like red colored water with no taste.  The shake was good.  Our meal came out long after and sides (fries) were all cold.  Not exactly what you want from sweet potatoe fries.  Would encourage people to NOT try this place - there are other eateries on the Main Street that are a thousand times better than this place.  Such a disappointment.    PS - had dinner at Toast 2 nights before and it was DELISH and service was awesome - try them instead."}
{"text":"I have gone in a few times, mid-late afternoon when it's quiet. somehow I wait 15-20 minutes for a tuna sandwich that's overpriced. and the portions are kind of small. the people aren't incredibly friendly, but that doesn't bother me much. never super impressed. the fries are pretty good though. maybe that's what takes so long."}
{"text":"Yum this place rocks, very impressed with the flavors, it didn't seem like much but every drink was really good and the staff very friendly and helpful"}
{"text":"Place is cool, very homey. The grilled cheese is the absolute best, cheese fries are really good, and you can't pass up on the fresh squeezed OJ and lemonade. For what it is you can't beat it."}
{"text":"This is our favorite stop! We come multiple times a week for a Dr Pepper with coconut and my little gets a happy camper! We love the cookies and the atmosphere of this place! Family friendly!"}
{"text":"Love it here it's just so laid back free WiFi nice staff great customer service refreshing from soda to tea or custard shakes fast service also a drive through if your on the go can't go wrong here"}
{"text":"I always go to sodalicious  and love it. My co worker told me about this place so I thought I would give it a try. Their employees are very friendly and I love the atmospheric and just how everything looks inside. I ordered the Italian soda with mango puree I was not too impressed. The flavor was not mixed well and just didn't taste good. I considering trying it agent next time definitely order a regular soda and not the Italian."}
{"text":"There are few places like the Soda Shop in rural PHX. The urban atmosphere reminds me of San Francisco and their newly flavored sodas are sure to make you leave happy (and come back in a few hours).   Dr. Pepper lovers, get the Big Daddy. It's a special blend of Dr. Pepper, coconut creme, and raspberry syrup. You won't regret it. Also the \"Cake Mix\" custard is the best out of the bunch. I came in during slow hours and they let me test out all the different custards. Cake Mix ftw.   This is bound to be a hot spot in the east valley, I would recommend this for anyone, at any time, for every occasion."}
{"text":"I worked here when The Soda Shop just opened up. I have since moved and don't work there anymore. This place is welcoming, fun and delicious! My favorite combo-The Waikiki and Iced Oatmeal Cookie!"}
{"text":"It's a nice place to chill with friends, or even to go with the drive thru when you are in a hurry. The employees are nice and helpful when ordering your drink! My favorite is called big daddy but you can mix any flavor if you don't like what is suggested on the menu. And the price is cheap! I love there cookies! The sugar cookie is to die for!"}
{"text":"Cute little shop that had a variety of sodas, teas and lemonade with really good cookies!   I forgot the name of the drink I tried, but it started with Jolly.  It came with Sprite originally, but i substituted for lemonade.   You can honestly pick any flavor you want and mix it together. They have some drinks already on the menu so you don't have to mix your own drink.  The chocolate cookie with white frosting was so good!"}
{"text":"Such a fun place for adults and kids. My whole family loves it. I love that it's also a fun hang out. We've been probably 15 times and have ways had fabulous service!  Please please open a store in Queen Creek!!!"}
{"text":"Adorable soda shop in Davidson. The food was fine, it's nothing extravagant but it makes it even more nostalgic....that it's just basic. Our server was just a college kid and he was very nice. All the employees seemed friendly unlike what other reviewers have said.   I thought $3.99 for a Coke float (and I asked for just a tiny ice cream) was unreasonable. But whatever, it's a fun experience."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Soda was fine but not worth the long wait.  It shouldn't take that long to get a soda and a cookie.  Hopefully management will get the place in shape soon.  We went on opening day and perhaps that was part of the problem."}
{"text":"Nice little soda shop. I have had some nice little lunches there and they make a good malt or Frostie (with vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrup)The sweet potato fries are good. If you are looking for a little place to grab a sandwich, its the place. But its small so go on off times"}
{"text":"I love this place. C and I have been here a bunch of times to try out different concoctions. Simply put, Soda Disneyland.   The decor is uber casual. There are plenty of seats either at the high tops, bar or the couches in front of the TV. The staff is wonderful. Every employee we've encountered has come across as really happy to be here. And I really appreciate that when the drive thru gets backed up, they send out an employee to take the orders to make the line move faster.  You can find out pretty much everything you need to know on their website. Check it out because you may want some time to craft your perfect soda experience. Did you ever take Jelly Belly's and try and make different tastes? Well, this is the same thing with soda. Get creative and have a blast. But, if you want the hard work done for you, the great folks at The Soda Shop have already assembled a nice list of pre-concocted masterpieces for your consumption. (Try the Fruit NInja, C swears by it)  They have 4 drink sizes, 16 base soda's including Coke Zero and Sprite Zero. Crazy. But, I do take away points because they do not have Diet Rootbeer.  Then add flavors, Creams, Fruit slices, & Puree's. And yes, everything you add does cost a few cents but check this out. You can get a 32oz soda with 2 added flavors and it still only costs $ 2.17. Where can you beat that? And, if you're into the float experience, you can also add a scoop of custard for $1.49 so making a Blue Powerade Float for example is super easy. (Not that I would ever...)  Add one of their amazing cookies for $1.89 and for under 5 bones you'll have a great time, a totally custom soda and a super good cookie to boot.  The Soda Shop also offers Concrete's, Italian Soda's and Fresh Brewed Teas. So check this out. Have you ever gotten a \"large\" Tea at one of those fancy coffee places? Over 4 bucks. Here, a 44oz Tea is $2.29. It's amazing. And, really, really good tea.   Like I said, C and I have been here a lot but this past week we brought K over for her first experience. At first she was a bit skeptical. \"A soda shop? Can't we just go through the Micky D's drive-thru?\"  Well, suffice it to say that after she finished her first Soda Shop soda, she hasn't stopped talking about it. She loved the menu so much, she even ordered a second small to try some different flavors. She's truly hooked as will you be.  Great Staff, Great Sodas, Great Cookies, Great Prices, Great Experience. 5 Stars."}
{"text":"I just moved to the area and have passed The Soda Shop many times without giving it a try, so when my boyfriend and I had a free moment this Saturday we headed on over to check it out! The environment is bright, fresh, and comfy! Rustic wood walls and industrial touches are contrasted with cozy couches and games galore! The staff was smiley and eager to help me navigate the new-to-me menu. There were so many flavor options and goodies to choose from! I chose to sip on some Butterbeer, complimented with a sugar cookie that tasted homemade! I was definitely impressed. This might just become my favorite way to treat myself!"}
{"text":"This is a great little breakfast place - not very big and not a wide menu, but still a good find and very reasonably priced.  Definitely a nice little neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"So I went here a few months ago visiting a relative. I wished we had one here in Austin! So delicious creative sodas. Everyone one had a different flavor and I love you can choose what you want. Good priced. My favorite had to be butter beer. My son loved land shark. The people working it seemed to like what they did. And very informative. If I am ever back this will be my first stop."}
{"text":"A cute little spot in downtown Davidson. Great sandwich shop with a good selection. I had a delicious grilled veggie and cheese sandwich and topped it off with a float. YUMMMM!"}
{"text":"Loooove all the drinks I've tried fruit ninja is my favorite!! I usually create my own and they make it perfectly every time. The cookies are amazing, try the iced oatmeal you won't regret it. Also the one of the owners is always there helping and talking with customers, they're the nicest guys! Love the atmosphere and even more the drive thru especially in early mornings on the way to school drop off!!"}
{"text":"Our favorite place to grab a soda and cookie!  He games inside are fun for one on one time with my kids."}
{"text":"How this place has stayed in business is beyond me.    In the 8 years I have lived in the area, this is only the second time I have eaten at the Soda Shop. I was not impressed the first time a few years ago and I was still unimpressed the second time. With all the college students at Davidson, this could be a real hot spot if they would try. I was on my lunch break and had a craving for grilled cheese. I ordered it with tomato.50, extra. I asked for it as takeout. After about 5 min and from looking at the menu I realized they had not asked me what type of bread I wanted. At this time , it was not crowded at all in there. I could not get my waitresses attention , so asked another server to please make sure my grilled cheese was on white bread. , Not Texas Toast which I deplore. It took 20 minutes to get this pathetic sandwich. In looking in the clear plastic container , I questioned whether it was really a grilled cheese!! The bread was still white! I was in a hurry so when I got in the I peeked at it. I had a bit of butter in the center of the bread, the cheese was melted but the whole sandwich was like 1/4 in thick.!!! It looked like an 8 yr old had made it.  It was Awful and the total price for this terrible sandwich and a soda was over 9.00  Never again will I eat here."}
{"text":"Pretty cool small town diner. Not many seats, first come first served. Sit at the bar or in a booth. You will see a family, an elderly couple of a group of teens in here. Ate the BLT, and it was decent. Hard to mess one up. Great place to come when toast is packed."}
{"text":"We drove 40 minutes for the grand opening. We waited in line for 90 minutes in 105 degree temp. That wouldn't have been so bad except the staff kept taking huge families from behind us in line and escorting them right in to the air conditioned building and serving them ahead of us.  I can only guess they must have been personal acquaintances. That wasn't right!!    The drinks and dessert were tasty, but the insult of the disregard for customers who gave up their whole Saturday evening to come there will be hard to get over."}
{"text":"Awesome milkshakes (which they'll make for you even during breakfast hours) and sweet potato fries.  Other than that, eh.  They serve breakfast (eggs, pancakes, etc -- I'm amazed they're still open after the Egg, and then Toast, opened), then sandwiches for lunch and dinner.  Not open very late.  But the milkshakes... are amazing."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge soda drinker, but this is a cute custom mixed soda concept that offers games and a casual environment for just hanging out and enjoying yourself in a non-alcoholic setting.  It's easily missed because of it's location at the end of the strip mall, but it's definitely worth a peek."}
{"text":"The time that I went, they didn't get my order correct. I also couldn't even taste the chocolate or the cherry."}
