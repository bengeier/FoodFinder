{"text":"Good value and tasty!

For lunch, their lunch selections of dishes with rice are pretty good.  I like their mabotofu with rice.  That's a spicy mix of tofu and minced port that is the typical signature dish of Szechuan, but most of the food is well above acceptable.

For dinner, they have takeout combos of Chinese dishes that comes with a proportional serving of rice and soup.  The servings are very generous.  A family of five can easily have a full dinner with just a 3 dish combo.  I've tried many combinations of dishes and they all came out tasty.   The 3 dish combo comes out to about $24 with tax included.

Among my favorites are the fish fillets with seasonal vegetables, Chinese style beef (sweet and sour), chicken with Chinese sausage and onions and garlic in a pot, sweet and sour fish filet, diced chicken gong-pow.  

You can have more exotic or more tasty dishes in other places, but if you have a few hungry mouths to feed at dinner, run out of ideas, and want to get good value, this is one of the best places in Richmond hill to order takeout from."}
{"text":"As I always say if youre looking for decent Chinese food, you don't look for the fanciest looking places (in fact, somewhat the opposite). As usual, the service is on point and the wait staff are willing to make sure you're taken care of. The prices are relatively affordable and the portions are solid."}
{"text":"Inexpensive luch, tasted VERY GOOD. Pay the extra for the hot and sour soup, it's the best anywhere! Don't go for the ambience and d√©cor...it's very basic. Staff is very kind."}
{"text":"Ordered take out a few times from here pricing is great but food quality is hit or miss. I've had a few times where the meat is not fresh. Especially the beef. My colleagues seem to like the place but I think I'll opt out the next time they place an order. If you're looking for cheap and quick lunch, this place will do."}
{"text":"My go to for local authentic Chinese food.  It's cheap and fast and portion sizes are quite reasonable.  It's not by any means a glamorous place, but it's a great option if you don't want to cook or splurge on anything fancy.

Tip:  They charge 5 cents for a take out container if you don't finish your dine-in food."}
{"text":"Another night with family, trying to decide where we wanted to go that would be a quick dinner. Ended up coming here, as we'd been on the rare occasion...

Never my top choice, but always decent food for a good price. Ordered off the special menu, which came with soup and a beverage. Each meal was okay, but came really fast to the table. However, like most Chinese cafes, there was a lot MSG in the food. 

Service here is very good. Servers are attentive, quick to react, and very friendly, which made the experience much better."}
{"text":"I really like their food here!  They have really reasonably priced combo sets for two, three, four, or more people.  In fact, if you order take-out, you get an automatic 10% off your bill too.  When we arrived, there were tons of boxes of Styrofoam boxes containing take-out orders that customers were arriving to pick up.

I like how for their dinners, they give you a complimentary pre-meal soup and also complimentary dessert at the end of the meal too.

Since it was the two of us, we ordered the two-person meal.  We ordered the Shrimps & Cashew Nuts and Fried Oyster Pancake dishes with two bowls of rice.  The portion of each dish was fantastic, especially the Oyster Pancake.  The tastes were great; definitely my kind of Chinese food.

Service was excellent too as I saw the two female staff always waiting by the counter to oversee the restaurant and serve their guests.  They came often to refill our tea and hot water cups. 

I will be returning again for sure."}
{"text":"A family run authentic HK restaurant, decor may not be attractive to you, but if u are looking for authentic HK food, this is a place to come.

They have a wide variety choices, personal combo, family deals, or afternoon tea, they also serve hot plate steaks as well.

The portion they give is more than generous, enough to feed an adult male for sure, taste is above average, milk tea is standard, and service is friendly.

I would recommend people near the area to go there as it is an authentic HK restaurants with affordable price in the area."}
{"text":"Who knew that in a little plaza like this, there'd be a surprisingly good Chinese takeout place? I wouldn't have known the entire plaza was here had my uncle not asked us to pick up the takeout order he had placed. 

Their curry beef brisket was surprisingly tender. It's not the best brisket I've ever had, but it beats a lot of takeout curry beef briskets I've ordered over the years. Their sweet and sour pork is good too."}
{"text":"Went for the first time for lunch.  Very friendly service.  Our 4 lunch specials came to the table within 5 minutes.  Meals included free soup and drink.
Shrimp paste minced beef fried rice was a huge portion and tasty.  We ordered stir fried rice noodles - ok wokhay.
Would definitely visit again if in the area.
It appears the vietnamese/malaysian place across the mall is the busiest restaurant in the mall."}
{"text":"It's located in a small food court called Richlane. Great taste, fast service?Have not been disappointed by any of the dish yet! The space is relatively small, you have to wait outside sometimes. The combo dishes have good value with free soup and desert soup!"}
{"text":"3.5 Stars.

Not a bad spot to get a quick lunch.  They have lunch specials that are $5.75-$6.75 that includes a pop and soup.  I tried the curry chicken on rice and it was good and the portions were filling.  I would for sure come back here and try another item on the menu."}
{"text":"It's located inside a fairly busy plaza and there are no outside entrances, meaning you must enter through the plaza. They're open all day for typical Chinese-style breakfast (congee, eggs, etc.) as well as simple dishes for lunch and dinner. Our table of two ordered a salted/preserved egg congee and a plate of beef noodles (ho fan), which came to less than $15. The portions were enormous and we could barely finish the 2 items for lunch. The lunch also came with a daily soup and a drink afterwards. We saw some other tables ordering their set lunches which come with a daily soup, a main course and a drink (milk tea, lemon tea, or add $1 for cold drinks). The main courses for those were piled high with meat, vegetables and rice, so they definitely do not skimp at all on the portion sizes. 

The only thing I would mention is that the decor is fairly outdated, their televisions are just playing channel 36 and it's not a fine dining experience. The prices are extremely competitive and their portion sizes are enormous, so that's what I think most people choose to come here for - a filling and cheap lunch."}
{"text":"This place screams Hong Kong. Every time I visit, it reminds of my last visit. Everything here is straight to the point, no frills, no 5 star service(not even a 3 star for service but it's expected), no golden utensils and fancy china, no fancy decor....well..except for that beautiful fish tank. LOL. The point is they don't need any of that to be authentic. They are as authentic and genuine as it comes. Just absolutely great food at an affordable price.

They are quite adventurous with their food despite their no frills approach. You will find very interesting combinations...ONLY if you can read Chinese (that doesn't include me :( . They have almost a limitless combination of stuff they can cook with off-menu items plastered all their walls and windows.

If you want absolutely tasty and geniune HK style food and some of the experience then this place is a must visit. You should bring someone that can read Chinese for the full experience."}
{"text":"This place has been my family to go restaurant for cantonese food recently. Small restaurant, reasonable price food and decent portions. Set meal comes with a drink. I suggest taking somebody who can read Chinese so at least you can read the menu on the wall. No English on the walls. 

We usually order the typical fried rice/noodles, stir fried beef, veggies, tofu, seafood. Service is fast. 

Great for take out too! They're pretty speedy and if you need more meats or food there's always the Excellent BBQ restaurant to get your to-go meat. 

Washrooms are in the mall outside the restaurant fyi."}
{"text":"Food 3 stars. Value +0.5 star.

Warning: unless you are a big eater, one stir fried noodle or rice here can feed two adults, male or female.  The $5.99 All Day Special can be regarded as two breakfasts. Hence, I suggest you to gauge carefully how much to order.

We came for lunch.  The three of us ordered a fried rice, a stir fried flat rice noodle and an all-day special.  The rice was deliciously salty.  It was totally my type of fried rice, though more meat slices would be better.  The noodle was oilier and loaded with curry flavors.  The chef was not stingy with condiments.  Again, there wasn't many meat and vegetables slices.  The all day special was really 2 breakfasts in one.  It was average.  Oh yes, we left with 3 small boxes of leftover.

If you are conscious about your blood pressure, I recommend you to request them to put in less salt."}

Another weekend, another HK style cafe.  Hong Far is located in the same complex as Dickens which I reviewed earlier.  It offers a cheaper experience if you're not looking to shell out.

Pros:
Prices are very good
Veggies!!

Cons:
Nothing spectacular (you come here for value)

When you look a the menu for this place, you'll notice there are many specials to choose from.  You have breakfast, lunch and all day specials.  Also to note, the menu has the Chinese items listed first, then on the very next page the translated item in English.  If I didn't speak or read Chinese, I would find this more convenient.  When we first sat down, we were automatically given a smaller set of bowls and cutlery for our little one.  Always a nice touch to not have to ask for this ourselves.

My GF ordered a pork chop in udon noodle soup while I got the Hai Nan chicken rice.  When the food comes out you immediately notice something.  You get a lot of veggies with your meals here.  Most HK style cafes give you one or two stalks of veggies.  This place gives you a full serving basically.  My rice was also not just a plain white rice, it was fried with some egg in it too.  These little things definitely go a long way.      

Having said all that, you are coming here if you want value for your dollar.  Our bill came to $15 for 2.  Amazing!  This is not the place you would choose though if you're really craving something special.  The food here is good, but not take a date out trying to impress him/her good.  It's the place to go if you want to get full for as as little as possible."}
{"text":"The table that we sat down at was already dirty, and should've been wiped first. One of the seats at our table was placed by one of the employee areas, and was often bumped into because the fishtank took up much of the room.

This is definitely a cheap eats quick-bite kind of place. The food was unmemorable, the prices were low but the food took long to come out."}
{"text":"Come for breakfast their soup base is extremely tasty and the food is well cooked

service is astounding where if you come your 2nd time, the waitress remembers you and talk to u. very well done"}
{"text":"This place has been here for awhile and finally decide to give it a try. Its not like some of the more \"popular\" HK cafe's with the baked dishes. More traditional chinese rice / noodle dishes seem to be their thing.

Portions are HUGE, cash only but very affordable pricing. Great service, don't think i've had better service at a HK cafe.

Their HK tea is not bad too but would ask for more milk next time.

Would go again if i'm near but won't crave for it."}
{"text":"I was on the hunt looking for a hole in the wall authentic Chinese place and I found it! I read about this place somewhere on line and decided to come here for lunch. This place is located in a building that I would normally drive by and not give it a second thought. But, this building has a bunch of restaurants in here. We got seated immediately after walking in. We ordered the taro with pork belly on rice, shrimp roe (?) with tofu and rice & crab with chives e-fu noodles (special on board). The shrimp roe with tofu and rice was ok but the shrimp roe was missing. We didn't know if we were given the wrong order or if they didn't put it in but we ate it anyway. It tasted pretty good. The e-fu noodles were a bit of a disappointment because it lacked seasoning and was dry. Our favorite was the taro with pork belly on rice because the pork belly was nice and fatty and it made the entire dish delicious! The taro was nice and soft as well. We ordered iced teas along with our orders. The teas came along with the meals. Also, we were given free soup, which was a plus! Service was what you'd expect in a Chinese restaurant and I didn't expect it otherwise. They forgot our taro with pork belly on rice order. I had to remind them and they brought it out right away. Love this place, though! Will definitely return again when in the area!"}
{"text":"Another place where you want food that are cheap and decent!

I was there for lunch today. Their phone never stop ringing with people placing order for take out.

There are quite good choices of Cantonese food set lunch and dinner that comes with beverage starting from $4.99.

The waitress was really helpful told me lunch special that was on the chalk board. I decided on the the 3 balls (fish, beef and cuttlefish) in noodle soup and a coffee.

It was sizable and has vegetables too!! Makes a great lunch!

The service is prompt and friendly! 

I would definitely goes back and try other things on the menu!

CASH only!"}
{"text":"Great portion, excellent BBQ duck/pork, low price, and fast service can make it a great restaurant. Always come for a quick lunch. 9 dollars can make you feel so filling"}
{"text":"Every weekend seems to be a debate with my family about where to eat to suit my dad's frugality. We tend to always eat at Congee Wong or Richmond court because of the large portions for the low cost. 

Ultimately, we decided to go to Dicken's cafe but in the same Richlane Mall, we passed by this restaurant. The lunch menu immediately caught our eyes. For $6.25, there is a list of dishes available such as shanghai noodles, curry beef brisket and fried rice with beef and garlic along with the choice of tea, coffee, water or a pop.

For the low of cost, the portions were large enough to share and pretty decent! As a bonus, the whole table also got a house special soup (wintermelon and pork soup) to share. It was a nice change of environment (although not the fanciest) and probably the biggest criticism is their loud fan or machinery noise that seems to be running for hours on end."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for the value. This is truly a great budget Chinese restaurant. I order take-out here frequently using the dinner combo options and it's great because it comes with a very big portion of rice and soup. If you pay in cash there's a 10% discount for take-out. I came here recently with 11 other people. We ordered 8 side dishes and it came with more soup, rice and dessert we could eat all for $8 per person. Some of the dishes weren't that great but none of them made me go wow, that was terrible!"}
