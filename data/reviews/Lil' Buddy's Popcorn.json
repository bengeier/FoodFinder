{"text":"OMG!!! Awesome customer service and excellent quality!  Flavored popcorn is of the highest quality.  They even allowed us to stay past closing because we accidentally came right before they closed.  They were very accommodating and professional.  I will not eat anywhere else in Oregon, WI.  Great food, great service, great people!  Hot dogs are real Vienna Beef, too."}
{"text":"All their popcorn is so addicting and fresh, I love it. They always have fresh kettle, cheese and caramel popcorn. Their flavored popcorn always vary and are all worth trying. Staff are all very friendly. 10/10 would recommend stopping by."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Lil' Buddy's. Lee has got a real \"wiener\" here!    Being a Chicago dog lover I was excited a few years back to hear that Lil' Buddy's was serving the real thing.   Starts with a great poppy seed bun, perfectly steamed, then a great hotdog with all the fixings.  But wait...there's more, way more!  Lee turned me on to the Chili-Mac Dog, and I haven't looked back.  Same great bun, same great hotdog, this time topped with Chili, Macaroni & Cheese, barbeque sauce, mustard, and onions.  My mouth is watering as I type this!  Fantastic! Lastly, you can't leave without getting a bag of popcorn.  Whether it's the standard buttered, popped fresh, or my favorite Lil' Buddy's Mix, Lee is always coming up with crazy and delicious combinations.  Oregon is lucky to have such a unique business.    It's dog gone good!"}
